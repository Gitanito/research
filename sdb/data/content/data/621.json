I should like\nto use the opportunity which this occasion offers me to share with you\nsome thoughts about the relation between the study of personality and\nthe inquiries with which we in psychical research are concerned, in the\nhope that each may illuminate the other.\nThe term \" personality \" is used in two senses. In Mr Tyrrell's stimu-\nlating volume. The Personality of Man,^ our chief concern is with person-\nality considered generically ; that is, with those attributes which belong\nto personality as such, and not simply to certain individual persons here\nand there. On the other hand, the term personality is also used to mean\nindividuality : to denote not the property of being a person as such, but\nthe distinctive properties by which one person is differentiated from\nanother. In the feeling that both uses of the term are warranted, we shall\ntry to relate psychical research to personality in general, and also to\nindividuality, as expressed in specific paranormal gifts which belong to\nsome individuals and not to others.\nI\nWe must still begin, I believe, with Frederic Myers's^ conception that\nevery personality is an integration of which only a limited portion appears\nat the conscious level. Personality is a system of energies which may\nthrow up to its surface certain visible forms\u2014specific cravings, or images\nor thoughts\u2014but which is not in essence contained by the boundaries of\nexplicit consciousness.\nIt is doubtful, of course, whether Myers's original conception of a rather\nsharp line of demarcation between supraliminal and subliminal can today\nbe maintained. It has appeared more and more that personality is a matter\nof shadings or gradations, not only with respect to consciousness or degree\nof organization, but with respect to almost every aspect of its being. From\n^ Pelican Books, 1947.\n^ Human Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death, 1903.\nA I\n\f2 Gardner Murphy [Part\nthis point of view we should have to say that supraliminal and subliminal\nprocesses appear to be essentially alike in most respects. There is,\nnevertheless, one basic sense in which Myers's conception has been\nvindicated by recent research, namely through the evidence that the\nconscious portion of our make-up may forcibly inhibit the operation of\nsubliminal activities, including the operation of those paranormal powers\nwith which psychical research is concerned. Of course it is not necessarily\ntrue that the subliminal has powers which the conscious can never realize.\nYet the fact remains that for most people living in a civilization like ours,\nconscious intelligence is pretty well saturated with fears or resistances\nrelating to the paranormal in general or to the paranormal in specific\nforms, and that this resistance may operate to make the subliminal less\neffective in the realization of its paranormal powers than it can become\nwhen such conscious control is removed. It would appear that the facili-\ntating effect which dreams, hypnosis, sensory and motor automatisms, as\nwell as states of \" trance, possession, and ecstasy \", seem to have in\nliberating the paranormal, may lie largely in the freedom from inhibiting\nconscious factors. Though the lower degree of effectiveness of the\nsupraliminal in paranormal processes may lie in its preoccupation with the\nimmediate physical environment, rather than through any intrinsic incom-\npatibility between consciousness as such and the paranormal as such, the\nmodern view would be similar to that of Myers in regarding the subliminal\nof all human beings as endowed with paranormal powers with which one\nordinarily has scant commerce at the conscious level.\nBut we need a sharper clarification of the way in which subliminal\nprocesses are set free. A convenient example is the Groningen experi-\nment in telepathy.^ A young student of dentistry, blindfolded, in a black\ncage in a lower room of the university psychology laboratory, received\ntelepathic impressions from experimenters in a darkened room just above\nhim, tapping out with his finger the specific points on a board which had\nbeen chosen by lot by the experimenters above. The feature of this\nexperiment that I would stress is that the man had fallen into a semi-\ntrance condition, a dissociated or abstracted state, and that this state of\nwithdrawal from active preoccupation with the outer world seemed to\nafford the basis for his telepathic powers. It was, so to speak, the dissoci-\nability of this man's personality, the openness of his subliminal to impres-\nsions from the experimenters, that made him so good a subject.\nOne is tempted here to use a hypothesis which has passed already\nthrough many schematizations and which I will offer in a form suggested\nby Warcollier.2 In this view we are concerned with subliminal operations\nnot only on the part of the percipient, but also on the part of the agent.\nThe hypothesis is that the agent's conscious desire to transmit impressions\nactivates a subliminal operation within him which causes a subliminal\nresponse in the percipient, and is then able to relay the content of the\nmessage to the conscious level of the percipient's mind. In point of fact,\nMrs Sidgwick's suggestion in 1923 about the reciprocity, the two-way\n' \" Some Experiments in Telepathy Performed in the Psychological Institute\nof the University of Groningen,\" Compte-Rendu du Premier Congres International\ndes Recherches Psychiques, 1922, pp. 396-408.\nExperimental Telepathy, 1938.\n\f177] Psychical Research and Personality 3\naction involved in telepathy, is compatible with this view ; she writes :\n\" . . . I think the kind of union of minds, the thinking and feeling together,\nhere shown may be regarded as the type or norm of telepathic communi-\ncation to which all other cases conform in varying degrees.\"^\nWe would then have the hypothesis that all human personalities are\ncapable of paranormal processes in so far as there is freedom from conscious\npreoccupation with the immediate sensory world, and in so far as there is\nsome sort of reciprocity between the deep-level operation of two indi-\nviduals.\nII\nNow let us face the question : is it true that all human beings have\nparanormal powers? When we speak of hunting for a \" good subject \",\nthe suggestion is offered that paranormal power is a special gift, like\nabsolute pitch. Is this the case, or is it in some degree the gift of all\nhuman beings.' I confess that over the years I have wavered back and forth\nbetween these alternatives : and have been very unsure how to answer\nthe practical research question : Is it worth while to set up experiments\nfor Tom, Dick, and Harry, or should we confine our experiments to the\ngifted Tom, and leave Dick and Harry out? But it seems to me that after\nthese years of uncertainty the evidence has finally driven us directly into\nthe view that we are concerned with generic, and not simply with indi-\nvidual gifts. Much depends upon the subtlety of the method, and the\ndevices that we use for reinforcing and bringing to maximal expression\nwhatever primitive and half-choked functions may be waiting for our\ndetection and cultivation. But many mass experiments have given posi-\ntive results. In the Pratt-Woodruff' experiment of 1939, a large number\nof subjects took part in a well-controlled experiment involving \" screened\ntouch matching \", with no part of the observation dependent upon what\nany one experimenter did or reported. Each subject had to match cards\nagainst targets placed on the other side of the screen from himself.\nMaterial was locked away after each session in boxes to which only the\nexperimenters had keys, and the data were doubly checked. In this\ninvestigation, as in others before and since, the effect is clearly a collective\neffect, and not dependent upon the performance of a few individuals.\nIt may, of course, be urged that a number of other mass experiments\nhave given negative results, but this I think misconceives the statistical\nissue. The critical ratio of 5 which was obtained by Pratt and Woodruff\nshould not be expected to occur even a single time among all the large-\nscale ESP experiments ever performed. It is possible either to get or not\nto get a particular group phenomenon depending on the method used.\nFor example, in public health research one may find evidence of vitamin\nD deficiency in a given North American urban group, or not find it,\ndepending upon the adequacy of one's technique : but if a competent\ninvestigation finds the deficiency appearing generically in a New York\n^ \" Pfiantasms of the Living.

It may be true that something happened in a group of human\nbeings at Duke University which could not happen in other groups of\nhuman beings elsewhere, but it seems more natural to believe that there\nwas something important about the method. The Pratt-Woodruff experi-\nment does not stand alone. Whately Carington^ repeatedly found mass\neffects. In the studies conducted at Stanford by Charles Stuart^ and\nanalyzed by Betty Humphrey,^ mass effects were found, and there are\nmany other examples. But I should be willing if necessary to rest my\ncase for mass effects on the Pratt-Woodruff investigation.\nIll\nWe turn to the individualized aspects of such data, that is, to the prob-\nlem of individual predispositions to the paranormal which may differen-\ntiate one personality from another. In Charles Stuart's'* method of testing\nfor clairvoyance a picture was placed in a large opaque envelope ; to the\noutside of the envelope was clipped a drawing sheet upon which the\nexperimental subject drew his guess as to the picture within. The\npositive results came en masse from subjects who were shown on the basis\nof the Elkisch drawing test^ to be people prone to make expansive drawings.\nAnd people who were prone to compressive drawings tended to miss the\ntargets to a significant degree. Humphrey*^ has suggested that those who\nare expansive in the drawing test are people who reach boldly and vigor-\nously for a challenging hidden target ;\nthey are capable of overcoming\nthe obstacles and asserting themselves successfully in this task. The\ncompressives not only fail, but overshoot the mark in their failure. Six\ndifferent cycles of clairvoyance tests yielded these same trends. We have,\nthen, a meaningful relation between personality attributes and paranormal\nperformance.\nThe Schmeidler^ experiments appear to warrant the same general\nconclusions.

The former group, the\n\" sheep \", in some sense know where the stars, circles, and so on actually\nare ; but the second group, the \" goats \", must also know where they are,\nbecause they cannot consistently miss them unless they know where they\nare. This latter process, sometimes called \" negative perception \", has\nbeen well demonstrated by Bruner and Postman^ in the ordinary, normal\nprocess of sense-perception. Such studies suggest that a complex sub-\nliminal process of feeling one's way toward the target is going on, and that\nother subliminal processes operate to prevent the contact with the target\nfrom appearing at the conscious level. The distribution of scores makes\nit clear that this is a mass effect, not an effect due to a few individuals.\nSo far, the Humphrey and Schmeidler approaches are identical ; in so far\nas attitude reflects personality, personality counts in paranormal perfor-\nmance. Yet this did not seem to Schmeidler to be a sufficient clarification\nof the problem. It was certainly not true that all believers could be\ncounted upon to score above chance nor was it possible from the data,\nas so far described, to make clear how individual personalities are oper-\nating. As an experienced clinical worker with the Rorschach ink-blot\nmethod, Schmeidler determined to do systematic Rorschach analyses of\nthose taking part in her current group experiments. Administering the\nRorschach test in group form, and scoring it by Ruth Munroe's method^\nto indicate good or poor social adjustment, she was able to show that well-\nadjusted sheep can be differentiated in their paranormal performances ;\nlikewise, well-adjusted and poorly-adjusted goats. The data thus yield\nfour groups, which score in the following manner : i. Well-adjusted\nsheep score significantly high. 2. Poorly-adjusted sheep score about at\nthe chance level. 3. Poorly-adjusted goats likewise score at about the\nchance level. 4. Well-adjusted goats score significantly below chance.\nIt is, she remarks, just as if each of the well-adjusted groups succeeded in\ndoing what it wanted to do\u2014the sheep to score above, the goats to score\nbelow chance.^ The two poorly-adjusted groups, however, manage only\nto stumble and fall, being bogged down apparently by their own intra-\npsychic conflicts, so that the sheep cannot score high, and the goats cannot\nscore low.*\nThis result was altogether \" too good \" ; and naturally she felt that the\n* Bruner, J.

Two large-scale repetitions have been\nmade by Schmeidler herself, with results in the same general direction ;\nand now Mrs Adeline Roberts, another Rorschach worker, has indepen-\ndently obtained corroborative results with a fresh set of Rorschach data.\nThis, of course, is not the same as to say that similar results can be\nobtained by everyone with every group. It is enough, however, to indicate\nthat the data are not entirely dependent on the Schmeidler procedure alone.\nWe might summarize the results so far by saying that individual needs,\nor purposes, bear a direct relation to paranormal cognition ; and at the\nsame time evidence that individual subliminal activities operate to set\nfree or to inhibit such processes. Perhaps we should say, as Hugh\nWoodworty did, that there is continuous \" blocking and unblocking \"\n;\na process by which the extension of ourselves in the direction of the target\nis throttled and constrained, and likewise a process by which the constraint\nis sometimes removed.\nFrom this standpoint there arises the question : Assuming that we are\nall motivated to reach a given target, are some of us more free than are\nothers to unblock, i.e. to remove these local blockages which seem to blunt\nour paranormal capacities? For example, are some of us more free from\ncensorship, more ready to make contact with anything and everything\nwhich is out there waiting to make its mark upon us? And are some of us\nby inheritance or by training more loosely put together, more easily\ninduced to fall into states of dissociation than others? The more easily\ndissociated individuals might be freer of blockages, simply dropping off\nthe offending baggage. This carries us back to emphasis upon devices\nwhich make it possible for sensory processes, as in crystal vision, to exter-\nnalize images which have been subliminally received, or to carry into overt\nmotor expression, such as automatic writing, the words or other symbols\nwhich have failed of an outlet. Assuming that there exists in the subli-\nminal a paranormally perceived reality, we may say that an automatism\nis effective in accordance with its degree of removal from contact with the\nconscious system of ideas. There are large individual differences in capacity\nfor such automatisms. There is, of course, no special virtue in automatisms\nas such, and many of them are devoid of all discernible traces of the\nparanormal ;\nyet if once we have evidence that the paranormal is struggling\nto express itself, we may perhaps help it on its way through the cultivation\nof automatisms.\nSensory automatisms are rather easy to cultivate. And if the present\napproach is sound, it is possible that normal everyday perception is in\nsome degree\u2014now more, now less\u2014affected by paranormal processes\noperating through sensory automatisms, and that we might learn to detect\ntheir effect. Thus a number of spontaneous cases of telepathy suggest\nthat the vehicle of their expression is the restructuring of present external\nstimuli. Rorschach plates and other indistinct material as used in the\n\" projective tests \" of personality, by permitting large individual differ-\nences in the form of perceptual organization, allow personality trends to\ninfluence cognitive structuring. Just so, perhaps certain spontaneous\ncases function essentially as projective tests.

Our hypothesis would take the following\nform : Other things being equal, those who are prone to sensory auto-\nmatisms are thereby prone to the distortion of their ordinary sense per-\nceptions through contamination by paranormal impressions. Likewise,\nsince automatic writing and other motor automatisms have in general the\nsame releasing functions, those most prone to such motor automatisms\nwould, other things being equal, be most likely to show an admixture of\nthe paranormal with their other motor activities.\nIf this makes sense, it may be worth while, in the study of extra-sensory\nphenomena, to do some preliminary tests upon the proneness of each\nsubject to automatisms, both sensory and motor. As a reason for believing\nthat this is worth while, I would emphasize that in the cross-correspon-\ndence group, and in other sensitives studied by the S.P.R., there is abun-\ndant evidence that automatisms yield data which the conscious individual\ncannot achieve unaided. Take the \" one horse dawn experiment the\neffort to convey a Greek phrase to Mrs Verrall. Despite the fact that the\nthought was at various times in the experimenter's mind (both supralimi-\nnally and subliminally) and available as the target for a period of months,\nit was only through automatism that success was finally achieved. In\nthe classical cross-correspondence, \"Hope, Star and Browning\",* the\nsuccessful transmission to automatists in Britain of a message formulated\nquite independently was accomplished through automatic writing in which\nreference to Browning's \" Abt Vogler \" expresses a theme given in Mrs\nPiper's trance.\nBut in setting up an experiment to test the relation of degree of dissoci-\nation to degree of success in paranormal processes, one notes the distinc-\ntion made by Margaret Reeves^ between the conditions operating in\nspontaneous cases and in experimental cases. In developing the implica-\ntions of Kurt Lewin's topological psychology. Reeves makes it clear that\nin spontaneous cases the type of dissociation which is operative is the\ntemporary removal of an outer shell or hull consisting of the daily pre-\noccupations of the conscious, waking individual. When this outer shell is\nremoved, he withdraws from the world into sleep, or trance, or a state of\nabstraction. There may then be a profound release of the deeper capa-\ncities. In experimental cases, on the other hand, the experimenter must\nemploy relatively superficial motivation such as curiosity, or the desire to\ngratify the experimenter, or win a prize ;\nconsequently, dissociation will\n' \" Cases,\" Jfoiirnal A.S.P.R., Vol. 38, 1944, pp. 48-52.\nTriibner & Company, 1886.\n^ Proc.

But when the motives which are near the surface are\nthemselves activated, as in a furious and successful effort towards high\nscores, nothing is to be gained by dissociation.\nIndeed, if this is the case, some questions emerge regarding the logic\nof attempting to test by experimental methods those hypotheses which are\nmost reasonable in relation to spontaneous phenomena. In the spontan-\neous cases, Nature often hurls at us profoundly moving dynamic forces\nwhich we can only occasionally control in the laboratory ; and the attempt\nto find in the general population individuals who will behave as if they\nwere successful recipients of spontaneous cases may be based upon a mis-\nconception of the problem. In this matter of testing for ESP, I am afraid\nthat my colleagues and I have often resembled the bees described by\nSamuel Butler, which wandered into the house through the open windows\non a summer day, attacked the flower designs on the wallpaper, and fol-\nlowed them slowly to the ceiling. Then they began at the foot of the wall\nnearby and worked their way hopefully to the ceiling again, and so on\nacross the room ;\nlearning, it would appear, rather little by the experi-\nmental method of hypothesis testing. It seems likely that our attempts to\nobtain positive results in telepathy and clairvoyance with the mass of\npeople is going to be successful only when we have fully analyzed the prob-\nlem of motivation and of working atmosphere. I suspect that in many of\nthe successful mass experiments some favourable psychological factor in the\natmosphere was achieved, and that it is not worth while to perform such\nexperiments unless one tries to learn more about such atmospheres. We\nknow as yet very little about them. In Rhine's^ and Tyrrell's- experiments\nthe subject's enjoyment of the task seems to be an asset, and in Rhine's\nearly work the likelihood of a positive result was made so real and com-\npelling to the subjects that they felt they must \" stand and deliver \". But\nour present formulations are naive, and we have years of work to do before\nwe can define the favourable states for a given individual in a given task.\n\u00a5or if and when it is finally established that all human beings by virtue\nof their needs and their capacity to free themselves from intrapsychic\nbarriers are capable of paranormal processes, it will only be because we\nhave in the meantime learned much more both about needs and about\nbarriers. What we know today is hardly more than the clue to a clue.\nThere is no direct evidence that the successful subjects reported by Soal\nand Goldney,^ Tyrrell, Rhine, Martin and Stribic,* for example, differ\nessentially from other people either in their needs or in the barriers to the\ncognitive activities which express these needs.\nIf we ask, then, what more we must find out to do better research, we\nmight first stress the great complexities through which needs and barriers\nevolve in childhood before they take the form revealed in adult personality.\n^ Extra- Sensory Perception, 1934.\n^\n\" Further Research in Extra-Sensory Perception,\" Proc.

It\nis not the needs in their raw infantile form but a complex and elaborate\npattern of needs that constitutes the going concern of the adult individual.\nIn order to work elfectively with the question of his needs, we should have\nto know, so to speak, what the paranormal means to him ; what he sees\nin the process, how he feels towards it, as it relates to the possibility of\nmaking contact with the world outside his immediate orbit of experience.\nWe should have to know in what way he protests against the restrictions\nof time and space ; the nature of his adventuresome challenge of an un-\nknown world. We must also know the specific meanings, direct and sym-\nbolic, which are served by the particular content, the particular drawings\nor card-symbols towards which he reaches out. In the same way, we\nneed to know very much more than we know about the nature of barriers\nand their removal. It may be that in one person the mind is like a city\nbuilt on islands interconnected with strong and solid bridges. Dissoci-\nation would be like the breakdown of one or more of the bridges, and could\nbe overcome only by arduous reconstruction. Another mind might have\nthe easy dissociability of a system of drawbridges, with an easy-break,\neasy-make, every few minutes or hours. It is almost certain that most\nbarriers are of a still more complex sort, to which psychoanalysis and other\ndeep probing methods have pointed. The paths of association or inter-\nconnection are criss-crossing lines almost like the lines of communication\nin a military terrain : devious, complex, irregular, and subject to bom-\nbardment as well as natural erosion, so that it would take a combination\ngeologist-map-maker-tactician to figure out the possible lines of com-\nmunication and of rupture of communication which are most important\nin any given terrain at any given time.\nThis mode of thinking would suggest that great progress is to be ex-\nexpected from psychoanalytic studies. This does not mean that anyone\nmust accept any theory which does not intellectually appeal to him ; but\nit means that deep-level exploration of unconscious psychic structures, in\nall their infinitely complex dynamics, is a major tool for psychical research.\nIn this belief, the group of medical men and women, mostly psychoana-\nlysts, who have recently constituted themselves the Medical Section of the\nAmerican Society for Psychical Research, have embarked upon studies\nwhich may throw light upon telepathic dreams and other paranormal\nprocesses which appear in their practice. This line of inquiry, initiated\nby Freud'^ himself over twenty years ago, has been carried forward by\nServadio,^ Eisenbud,^ Ehrenwald,* Pederson-Krag,^ and others.\n^ Neiv Introductory Lectures on Psycho-analysis, 1933.\n^\" Psychoanalyse und Telepathic, \" Imago, Vol. 21, 1935, pp. 489-97.\n^ \" Telepathy and Problems of Psychoanalysis,\" The Psychoanalytic Quarterly,\nVol. 15, 1946, pp. 74-9 :\n\" The Dreams of Two Patients in Analysis interpreted\nas a Telepathic Reve a Deux,\" ibid..

All of this is ulti-\nmately directed by the belief that if once the complex blockages at an\nunconscious level may be removed, one may move toward understanding\nand control of the paranormal.\nIV\nThis is, of course, a long-range goal, a matter of many years. But even\nwhen all of this has been accomplished and stands in full stature before\nus, I must confess that I believe that beyond both needs and barriers there\nis a tertium quid. There is, I suspect, some supplementary principle, or\nindeed, some over-arching all-encompassing principle. To introduce my\ntertium quid, I will tell you the odd story of Lillian Levine.\nLillian Levine was one of a group of Hunter College women who came\nto our laboratory in a group experiment under the direction of Mrs Dale.^\nMiss Levine sat in an experimental room operating a signal set which\nrequired her only to depress one or another of five keys, to indicate which\nof five cards she guessed to be the target in a randomly prepared series.\nIn another room sat Dr Ernest Taves, who witnessed the experiment, and\nMrs Dale, the experimenter, with a deck of ESP cards, from which one\ncard at a time was removed and exposed as a target. Well, as Miss Levine\nbegan a run, she got 15 consecutive calls correct. Since these cards were\nset up by random numbers, and the odds of one in five remain constant\nthroughout the operation, it is about a one in thirty-thousand million shot\nto succeed in 15 consecutive calls.\nHot on the trail of this bizarre phenomenon, we attempted to get some\nsort of clue as to what Miss Levine had done. The most that we could\nfind out was that she had looked at the radiator in the room in which she\nsat, and had seemed to see the various symbols, like crosses and waves, in\nthe rhythmic protuberances and recesses on the side of the radiator. So\nfar she was like the man who saw his friend's \" death mask \". She had\nnot, however, been in any marked trance or abstracted state. In fact,\nwhen she saw these images in the radiator, it did not really mean the kind\nof seeing that one has with a crystal vision, but rather the kind of half-\nseeing, half-imagining which occurs in responding to a cloud or a Ror-\nschach test. We proceeded, of course, to give Miss Levine a Rorschach\ntest, and we wearied her a good deal, I think, with attempts to probe into\nwhat happened. But we got nowhere. We did not find out anything so\nvery unique about Miss Levine's needs or intrapsychic barriers. Even\nif we had done so, we should still be unable to explain how she fell into the\nsuccessful groove and how she fell out again. We are not in a mood to\nsay that such an amazing performance is \"just one of those things\".\nRather, we are inclined to say that psychical research is full of cases of our\n1\" A Further Report on the Midas Touch,\" Journal A.S.P.R., Vol. 37, 1943,\npp. 111-18.\n\f177] Psychical Research and Personality\ntertium quid, cases in which the maximum you can do with the theory of\nneeds and with the theory of barriers still leaves you with something big\nupon which you still cannot get your fingers. For the point is that some-\nthing new and difTerent happened suddenly to her\u2014perhaps a deep-level\nI\ncontact with Mrs Dale, perhaps a basically different way of orienting her-\nself to her task. But what happened was not a gradual drifting away and\nback ; it was a clean break with her usual procedure.\nI have wondered whether the Shakespeare plays have not attempted to\ntell us the same thing. Notice, for example, the pla^'^vright's handling\nof Banquo's ghost. The phantasm appears suddenly, sharply\u2014cleanly,\none might say. Macbeth does not toy with the question whether he is\nsuffering from a hallucination of the \" heat-oppressed brain \" ; he\nscreams :\n\" Thou canst not say I did it.\" When the apparition disappears,\nMacbeth instantly recovers, exclaiming, \" Why, now, being gone, I am a\nman again! \" The playwright, as if to reinforce his intention, has actually\ngiven us stage directions : twice the Ghost enters, and twice \" exit Ghost \".\nOne is not dealing in such instances with the normal waxing and waning\nof human needs or of human barriers relative to such needs ; one is not\nsimply reaching out and making some sort of contact with the vast world\noutside ;\nrather, something is invading the individual, invading almost in\nthe sense which Myers used in Phantasms of the Living. The process of\npsi-gamma, as Professor Thouless and Dr Wiesner^ name it, is action\nnot only by the individual, but upon the individual.\nThe exploration of the tertium quid seems to lead to a result largely fore-\nseen by Myers and Mrs Sidgwick. This result, I believe, has the regular\ncharacteristics of a new scientific idea in the sense that such ideas are\nlikely at first flush to be quite shocking ; then after a moment's catching\nof the breath, they are likely to appear utterly banal, obvious, not worth the\npoint of making, and then third, as one thinks over the two earlier phases\nof one's thought, one begins to say, \" Well, this is after all a different way\nof looking at things ; let us set up experiments to see whether one can\npredict the outcome more accurately from the new formulation than one\ncan from the old.\"\nSo, for whatever my suggestion may be worth, I will suggest that the\nthird clue to the paranormal lies beyond the realm of needs and barriers,\nindeed that it does not lie inside of human personality at all, whether in its\ngeneric or in its individualized aspects. I believe, on the contrary, that\nI\nit is strictly interpersonal ; that it lies in the relations between persons and\n'\nnot in the persons as such. If it be objected immediately that it must be\npersonal if it is to be interpersonal, then let me plead that there is all the\ndifference in the world between our stretching the conception of the per-\nsonal to the breaking-point and on the other hand, our burning all our\nindividualistic bridges behind us, and saying that the world of interper-\nsonal phenomena is a world which must be faced on its own terms ;\npur-\nsued in its own right ; its laws made clear and recognized to be essentially\ndifferent from those laws which apply to individuals. I would plead for the\ndirect empirical study of the laws of the interpersonal ; the functions of\nan interpersonal field. I suggest that it is not within the individual\n\" The Psi Processes in Normal and '\nParanormal '\nPsychology,\" Proc.

For did not Soal and Goldney^ tell us that the\ntelepathic gifts of B.S. were not liberated by all situations, nor by all\nagents, but only under certain conditions, with certain people serving\nsuccessfully as agents and others utterly unsuccessful in the attempt?\nDid they not clearly demonstrate that the powers were not the powers of\nB.S., but the powers, so to speak, of certain couples\u2014or, indeed, powers\nexpressed by certain field situations in which experimenters, agents and\npercipients were all essential dynamic constituents?\nHas not Dr Soal told us in his Myers Memorial Lecture^ about the ex-\ntraordinary phenomenon of divided agency? Mrs Stewart can receive\ntelepathically from two agents, neither of whom actually knows the picture\nto be transmitted. One of them knows the spot where the target picture\nlies, but not what picture it is, and the other knows what pictures lie at 5\ngiven spots, but not which spot will be selected as the target location.\nHere is a field function with a vengeance! This is indeed reminiscent of\nthe hypothesis off^ered by Mrs Sidgwick,^ according to which a sitter's\nmind acts in such a way as to establish a relation between the medium\nand a distant living person, so that the interaction of at least three person-\nalities in involved.\nThis would mean that systematic, sensitive, resourceful investigations\nof the personalities of experimenters as well as of subjects, need to be taken,\nand of the interrelations of personality. I would like to quote here an\nobservation of Schmeidler's* made on the basis of one of her studies of\ngroup atmospheres as they relate to clairvoyance tests :\n\" I should like to generalize from the results in some such way as\nthis : in a group which considered the atmosphere of the experiment\nto be unpleasantly cold and intellectual, only the subjects who were\nthemselves rather cold and intellectual responded positively and made\ngood scores. In the other experiments a different atmosphere was\nestablished, and a different personality pattern in the subjects led to\nsuccessful responses.\n\" If this generalization is correct, what are its implications? One\nconclusion would be that my research does not show the personality\ncorrelates of ESP ability as such, but only of ESP ability under the par-\nticular conditions of the experiment. Whenever the situation varies\nwidely from these conditions, we can expect the optimum personality\npattern to vary also.\"\n^ See footnote 3, p. 8.\n\" The Experimental Situation in Psychical Research,\" being the Ninth\nFrederic IV.

Indeed, what did happen when B.S. was tested by a prearranged\ntelepathy method to see if he could get an agent's thought at the time?\nHe failed ; and it was only later discovered that he had his own way of\nfunctioning in this situation, namely, with reference to the future and the\npast. What about the people whose way of functioning we have not yet\nhappened to discover? Are they gifted or non-gifted, or is the answer\nrelative to the method? Again, forgive me when I say I am confused\nwhen I hear people tell us that we should spend all our time looking for\ngood subjects. Can we really be sure that there are any good subjects in\nan absolute sense? Individual endowment, like that of B.S. and Mrs\nStewart, is of the utmost importance; but the endowment appears in\nrelation to a particular task, method, and personal setting. It is true, and\nvery important, that B.S. and Mrs Stewart scored with several agents. It is\ntrue that Mrs Piper and Mrs Leonard have exhibited brilliant powers with\nmany sitters. If what I am urging is sound, there should be found in certain\ngifted individuals a great many \" open lines \" of interpsychic communi-\ncation, so to speak ; but these are still dependent on a larger context.\nInterpersonal factors released by the experimenters are certainly major\nfactors in such contexts.\nOne of the outstanding things about the Duke University research, I\nthink, has been the inculcation of certain attributes in certain experi-\nmenters which make it possible for them to set free something with certain\nindividual subjects. This does not mean that they can always set it free,\nnor that what they obtain from one subject is the same as what they obtain\nfrom another. But my mind goes back to the year 1934, in which I first\nvisited Rhine at Duke University, and saw the rugged force of the demands\nwhich he made upon his co-workers and subjects. In the light of his\nglowing intensity, it became possible to begin to understand the accounts\ngiven in his book of the way in which he had driven some of his subjects\nin the demand to get extra-sensory phenomena. It may well have been\nthis intensity which produced the results\u2014including some of the best-\nauthenticated long distance results which we have in all this field. In the\ncase of Schmeidler's studies in clairvoyance I believe the results may well\nhave arisen from a very different kind of intensity, namely her sheer\nunwillingness to let people fail. And it was, I am convinced, the intensity\nof Mrs Dale's^ devotion to her first independent PK experiment, of which\nshe was so proud, and in which so much ego was invested, from which her\nbrilliant positive results emerged. Whately Carington's methods were\nsuccessful time and again with groups that he organized, and which caught\nhis spirit ; but no such comparable results have been easily obtainable away\nfrom the white heat of his own brilliant personality. There must, of course,\nbe the fullest possible control whether the intensity level is high or low.\nI doubt whether we can go on with the tradition that an experimenter\n\u2014\n1\n\" The Psychokinetic Effect : The First A.S.P.R. Experiment,\" Journal\nA.S.P.R., Vol. 40, 1946, pp. 123-51.\n\f14 Gardner Murphy [Part\nany experimenter\u2014undertakes to test a subject\u2014any subject\u2014with a\nstandard method\u2014any standard method\u2014for ESP or PK. If an experi-\nmenter in the abstract tests a subject in the abstract with a method in the\nabstract, experience shows that we can be pretty certain that we shall\nhave nothing to show for our pains. I am much gratified to note in the\nmost recent number of the S.P.R. Journal that Dr West has ably stated the\ncase for individualizing the method of testing.\nBut I am really asking you to consider a rather simple, naive, and dis-\nturbing hypothesis, a conception which points not to the solitary grandeur\nand rugged independence of personality, as we like to conceive it, but to\npersonality as a node or region of relative concentration in a field of vast\nand complex interpenetrating forces, in which none of us is completely\nindividualized any more than he is completely washed out in a cosmic sink\nof impersonality. Our roots lie between the personal and the impersonal,\nbetween the I and the It, between the local and the universal, between the\npresent and the timeless. Here, one comes close to some classical concep-\ntions both of India and of our Western tradition, which suggest the rela-\ntivity of our independence and separateness from one another, and indicate\nthat the anchorage of our personal natures in the circumstances of the\nmoment and of the place may perhaps be considerably less absolute than\nis supposed. Just as the field theory of Clerk-Maxwell has taught us to\nthink of the distribution of energy in a time-space rather than in terms of\nlittle chunks of matter, so in psychology one may find it feasible to think\nin terms of the field relations that develop to encompass and express a\ngroup of persons.\n^\nAlong these lines, we find a rich opportunity for closer cooperation with\npsychology, especially social and clinical psychology, so deeply concerned\nas they are with interpersonal relations. Much more can be done as\nclinical methods and methods of research on social groups progress. This\nis why I am in such full agreement with Professor Thouless as to the need\nfor an organic unity of psychology and psychical research, in which each\nwill throw light upon the other.\nThe moral effect of psychical research in breaking down classical dog-\nmatism regarding the limitations of the human personality to the world\nof its senses, is beginning to be glimpsed here and there. And the methods\nby which unconscious motivation, blockages to communication, inter-\npersonal dynamic effects can be explored in relation to the paranormal will\nhelp us to understand psychological and interpersonal dynamics as they\nappear in daily life. At the same time, we in psychical research owe a\ngreat debt to experimental and clinical psychology. It has over and over\nagain given us new techniques for the study of motivation, of dissociation,\nof unconscious blocking and unblocking. It has given us projective tests,\ndevices for studying atmospheres and interpersonal effects. Just as\npsychology cannot get along without psychical research, so psychical\nresearch cannot get along without psychology. It is even possible that, as\nSchmeidler and Pratt and Humphrey have suggested, the same general\nlaws which hold in all psychology, laws relating to the structuring of the\nworld of perception, relating to the influence of motivation upon such\nstructuring, relating to the Gestalt principles of membership character,\n\flyy] Psychical Research and Personality 15\nclosure, salience, relating to the satiation of motives and the role of sub-\nstitutes during such satiation, and indeed all the general psychological\nlaws may be found to apply perfectly to paranormal perception. At the\nsame time, certain laws emerging first in paranormal perception, such as\nthe ability of subjects consistently to miss targets to a significant degree,\nlater emerge in normal perception.\nIt is possible, in short, that the two worlds are one except for some\nsingle principle which, so to speak, throws on a particular switch. If this\nshould prove to be the case, our attention might ultimately be directed to\nthe nature of this switch. It is also possible that the three clues suggested,\nnamely, unconscious motivation, dissociation, and interpersonal organiza-\ntion or field relationships may prove to be all that is needed. It is quite\npossible that if we can state the interpersonal structure of a situation so\nifully that its motivational dynamics and its intrapsychic and interpsychic\nbarriers can be fully defined, we shall be able to state when and where a\nparticular paranormal process will appear. At any rate, I would suggest\nthe experiment of looking upon personality as the same subject matter\nwhether it happens to be studied by psychologists or by psychical resear-\nchers ; that we regard the paranormal as emerging from lawful and ulti-\nmately intelligible factors operative within normal personalities ; that we\nregard psychical research and general psychology as interpenetrating and\n'\nat times fusing, and always sharing outlooks and methods ; and finally,\n: since all psychological phenomena are to some degree individualized, that\nwe make the most of all of those methods by which individuality may be\nstudied with a view of trying to understand individual paranormal gifts ;\nremembering that the individual with his marked gifts is never utterly\nsundered from the less gifted about him, and that his special gift is in\nsome degree a function of that interpersonal existence which all human\npersonality expresses.\nIf this is sound, there is equal need in the coming years for two types of\nresearch : first, a need to continue the exceedingly important studies of\nthose individuals who are highly gifted in specific ways, such as clair-\nvoyance or precognition, finding why it is that they fluctuate in the presence\nof different persons and under different conditions, and setting up testable\nhypotheses regarding interpersonal dynamics. Secondly, there is a need\nfor mass researches along lines in which the group atmosphere or social\nclimates can be fully specified and empirically tested. When one gets a\ngroup effect, one would at once attempt to define what is operating ; one\nwould develop such clinical methods as have already been used by\nHumphrey, Schmeidler, and others, and apply them mercilessly to all\nparticipants, including oneself.\nSo, as my time draws to a close, you find me pleading for more study\nof those deep resources of human personality of which Frederic Myers\nI first made us fully aware, working in close contact with psychology,\npsychiatry, and the social sciences ; more explicit recognition that psychi-\n1 cal research has a huge contribution to make to an understanding of human\nI\nnature ; and indeed a willingness to consider the possibility, even in times\nas troubled as our own, that we may do our own part to help find a sound\nbasis upon which to predicate the oneness of the human family ; its fulfil-\nment, through deeper interpersonal ties, of its place in its cosmos.\n355453\nli\n\fEXPERIMENTAL OBJECT- READING* : A CRITICAL REVIEW]\nOF THE WORK OF DR J. HETTINGER j\nI\nBy Christopher Scott\nj\nABSTRACT |!\nIn this paper an exhaustive analysis is attempted of the work of Dr J.\nHettinger on the experimental investigation of object-reading.\nThe first section deals with the work reported in Hettinger's book\nThe Ultra-Perceptive Faculty, in which a painstaking attempt was made to\ndevelop objective control methods for demonstrating the existence of a\nparanormal factor in object-reading material. These methods are closely\nexamined and a large number of faults both in Hettinger's use of statistics\nand in his experimental design are found. It is shown that when the\nstatistical errors are corrected the results are still highly significant. There\nremain, however, more than twenty methodological faults any of which\nmight have contributed to the positive results without recourse to the\nparanormal. The data provided by Hettinger are inadequate to show\nwhich of these sources of error, if any, contributed to the significant figure\nobtained. The section concludes with the verdict that there is quite\ninsufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that there is any paranormal\nfactor at work in the results reported in this book, and that Hettinger's\ntechnique for investigating object-reading is very far from foolproof.\nThe second section deals with Hettinger's book Exploring The Ultra-\nPerceptive Faculty, in which a novel method of investigating object-reading\n\u2014the \" pictorial method \"\u2014is developed. This book scarcely attempts\nto be of a scientific nature, since it relies on the technique of selecting a\nnumber of the most striking coincidences from a total collection of\nunspecified size. An attempt is made in this section to estimate the size\nof this selection factor and to show how highly misleading is this method\nof presenting the evidence. The conclusion is reached that only an objec-\ntive control technique can put the \" pictorial method \" on a scientific\nfooting.\nThe third section deals with an article by Hettinger in the Journal of the\nAmerican S.P.R., in which an attempt is made to demonstrate trans-\natlantic telepathy by means of a control technique applied to the \" pictorial\nmethod \". Various control methods are described by Hettinger in the\narticle. These are examined in this section and it is shown that on the\nonly occasion on which a sound method was used the results were com-\npletely negative.\nIn view of Hettinger's suggestion that these negative results may have \\\nbeen due to the inexperience with mediumistic material of the judge\n* The term object-reading is used in this paper to denote the (alleged) faculty of\nusing an object to obtain paranormal knowledge about its owner (or, occasionally,\nj\nabout the history of the object). This faculty has often been called \"psychometry\", j\nbut the word has an alternative and well-established meaning in psychology, and is\n\"\nso inappropriate tnat it has been decided to use the less objectionable term 'object-\nreading '\nin this paper.\ni6\n\f[Part 1 77] Experimental Object-Reading: A Critical Reviezv 17\nwho carried out the assessment in this particular case, the writer of this\npaper carried out an experiment along the same lines in which a completely\nobjective control method was used and Hettinger himself acted as judge.\nThe results of this experiment were also entirely negative. The fourth\nsection of this paper deals with this experiment and attempts to draw a\nmoral. In the concluding paragraphs the possibility that the control\nmethods themselves might obscure or inhibit positive results is considered,\nand it is shown that the nature of the control methods used render this\ntheory untenable.\nAlthough this paper may seem almost entirely destructive in its content\nit is written with the object of paving the way for the design of a totally\nfoolproof technique for the experimental investigation of object-reading.\nIntroduction\nDr J. Hettinger is an electrical engineer who, since 1934, has devoted\nhimself to a remarkably industrious series of experimental investigations\nof object-reading. His reports of these investigations are to be found in\ntwo books,* The Ultra-Perceptive Faculty (London, Rider, undated but\napparently 1940), and Exploring the Ultra-Perceptive Faculty (London,\nRider, 1941), and an article in the Journal of the American S.P.R. for July,\n1947, vol. XLI, No. 3, pp. 94-122. Hettinger's work has attracted consider-\nable attention. In September 1947 he read a paper on some of his recent\nexperiments before the British Association for the Advancement of\nScience, and in September-October 1947 carried out a short experiment\nin cooperation with the Daily Express. His work has also received fre-\nquent mention in recent psychical literature.\nThe importance of Hettinger's work is not only that it forms one of the\nmost thorough experimental investigations that have yet been made into\nmental mediumship, but also that it brings psychical research through\nthe pioneer stage in this extraordinarily difficult study. Like many\npioneers, Hettinger has had the unfortunate role of falling into traps in\norder that those who follow him may know how to avoid them. If my\ncriticisms of Hettinger's methods seem harsh, it must be remembered\nthat it is only by drawing attention to his errors that we can get the full\nbenefit from his pioneer work and learn by his mistakes how to design an\nexperimental technique that is beyond criticism.\nApart from reviews of Hettinger's books in the S.P.R. Journal I know\nof no attempt at a criticism or analysis of his work. This is a serious\ndeficiency, which the present article is designed to correct. I shall analyse,\nas thoroughly as seems necessary, Hettinger's two books, his report in the\nA.S.P.R. Journal, and two control tests he carried out with myself as\nsubject. Finally I shall attempt to sum up the conclusions that can be\ndrawn from all this work.\nThe reader who prefers to skip passages demanding mathematical\nknowledge should not miss anything of very great importance, provided\nhe is prepared to take for granted the conclusions which emerge from them.\n* Both now out of print.\nB\n\fi8 Christopher Scott [Part\nThe reader may be surprised to find, on one or two occasions in the\nsection on Hettinger's first book, speculations about Hettinger's exact\nprocedure followed by a footnote answering these speculations with a\ndefinite statement given to me verbally by Hettinger. I have adopted\nthis arrangement for two reasons : first, the main text of my paper (except\nfor the last section, on some hitherto unpublished experiments) is intended\nto stand as a criticism of Hettinger's published work ; and secondly, the\ninformation obtained directly from Hettinger was given me verbally\u2014in\nanswer to questions which I put to him quite without notice\u2014more than\nten years after the events it referred to. For this reason I am uncertain\nwhether the same reliance should be placed on it as on the statements\nmade in the more ofiicial published account, and I have relegated the very\nsmall amount of such information to footnotes (pp. 29, 33).\nFinally, I would like to thank all my friends who have helped me with\nthis paper, especially Mr A. M. Western for many helpful discussions,\nDr West for his continued help and encouragement, and Mr Fraser Nicol,\nwho very kindly undertook some of the most laborious statistical work\nfor me. I am very grateful, too, to Dr Hettinger himself for arranging\nfor me, at his own expense, the two sittings referred to in Part IV.\nPart I\n\" The Ultra-Perceptive Faculty \"\n\/. Summary of the work.\nThe Ultra-Perceptive Faculty, for which Hettinger was awarded a\nPh.D. by London University, consists principally of an account of 12\nseries of experiments in object-reading carried out by Hettinger at King's\nCollege, London, between May 1934 and September 1937. The essential\nbasis of the experiments remains constant throughout. Articles such as\nwallets, pencils, rings, cuff-links, combs, keys, letters, and sometimes\nblank sheets of paper, are submitted to Hettinger by his friends and\nacquaintances, or by their friends and acquaintances, and enclosed in\nsealed envelopes. They are then given by Hettinger to a medium or\n\" sensitive \" who gives readings on them {i.e. attempted descriptions of\ntheir owners) in Hettinger's presence and without removing them from\ntheir envelopes. These readings are recorded by Hettinger and returned\nto the owners for annotation. The 12 series of experiments described\nin The Ultra-Perceptive Faculty constitute successive attempts to find\nimproved methods of experimenting on this basic method in order to arrive\nat a technique producing results which are at the same time favourable\nand valid.\nBefore the experiments are described in detail a note on terminology\nwould perhaps be useful.\nThe article is the object submitted for object-reading.\nThe subject (\" absent sitter \") is the owner of the article.\nAn item is a statement made by the medium relating to the subject.\nA reading is the collection of items given on a single object at one\nsitting. (A sitting in Hettinger's work usually elicits from 4 to 6 readings\nand from 40 to 100 items.)\n\f177] Experimental Object-Reading : A Critical Review 19\nA test consists of the object-reading of one article, and hence provides\none reading.\nA record consists of a list of items (usually including control or dummy\nitems) sent out to a subject for annotation {i.e. for marking which apply\nand which do not).\nThe 12 series described in the book use a variety of methods, and the\nwhole forms a rather heterogeneous mass of material, so that it is impos-\nsible to describe it more briefly than by reproducing Hettinger's own\nsummary (Chap. X, Section IV).*\n\" The methods used in the preliminary tests (ist Series) were of\ntentative character. They were as follows :\n\" I. A ^multiple control' method, according to which copies of all\nrecords (generally four) obtained at one sitting were given to the four\nsubjects and each one had to select the one he or she thought would be the\nmost applicable one to him or her. Since a good many applicable items\nappeared on all the records, the subjects found it difficult to make a proper\nselection.\n\" 2. A 'made-up control' method, according to which the record given\nby the sensitive was coupled with a '\nmade-up control '\nrecord. The\nexperimenter did not find it convenient, nor easy, to make-up such a\nrecord, and he also thought the method would be open to serious criticism,\neven if such record were made-up by another person than himself.\n\" 3. A combined method of '\nmade-up control ' and '\nevaluated '\nitems,\nwhich diff'ered from 2, in that the items were given different values. The\ndrawback of this method is the arbitrary nature of the evaluation.\n\"4. A '\nchecking '\nmethod, according to which the owner of the object\non which the record was obtained filled in the record, and a number of\nother subjects were then asked to state which of the items on that record\nwere applicable to them.\n\" The latter method, which seemed promising, was adopted for statis-\ntical purposes in the 2nd Series of tests. However, the series was soon\ndiscontinued in view of the results of a reliability test. This test showed\nthat the high scoring obtained in that series had an easy psychological\nexplanation, namely, the tendency of some of the subjects to accept more\nitems on the record they knew was theirs than on the records which they\nknew did not belong to them.\n\" There followed a short 3rd Series, wherein the checking method was\nretained with the modification that each subject was asked to fill in all the\nrecords obtained at the same sitting, without being told which one was\nhis or hers. This method, which is very similar to the tentative '\nmultiple\ncontrol '\nmethod above referred to, had the drawback that, since the\nsubjects knew that only one record was theirs, yet all of them contained\napplicable items, there was a great tendency to guessing in the case of\nsome of them, so that, by deciding that one of the records was theirs, a\ndefinite bias was introduced in their annotations of all the records as a\nwhole.\n* My thanks are due to Dr Hettinger and to Messrs Rider & Co. for permission\nto reproduce this extract. I have made a few minor alterations to bring Hettinger's\nterminology into line with my own.\n\f20 Christopher Scott [Part\n\" The statistical proof of the probable existence of the ultra-perceptive\nfaculty was solely based on the control methods which followed. These were :\n\" I. The method of admixed control items (4th Series), according to which\ntwelve items given by the sensitive were mixed with twelve '\ncontrol\n'\nitems, and the subject had to state which of the items were applicable to\nhim and which were not. The control items were drawn from a '\nguess-\nbox '\nwhich contained the items given by the sensitive in connection with\nprevious records.\n\" This method, like all the variations that followed, has the advantage\nthat the character of the results obtained is independent of the tendency\nof the subjects to accept a small or a great number of items, being deter-\nmined by the ratio of the items R : W [Right : Wrong] accepted from among\nthe items given by the sensitive and the control items respectively.\n\" The method proved satisfactory and reliable, but the experimenter\nthought an improvement thereon could be secured by dispensing with the\n'\nguess-box '\nand introducing the following modification.\n\" 2. The method of selection by mutual consultation (5th Series). Accord-\ning to this method the items given to two subjects were intermixed on one\nrecord, and both were asked to cooperate and decide between them which\nitems were more applicable to the one and which to the other. This\nmethod, which the experimenter still considers a good one, was aban-\ndoned for the following practical reason : he did not find sufficient suitable\nsubjects who could conveniently cooperate in that way.\n\"3. The method of selection by graded significance (6th Series) was a\nfurther modification of the method of admixed control items ; it mainly\nconsisted in that the items given to two subjects in connection with their\nrespective articles were intermixed, and the subjects were asked to grade\ntheir selected items according to their significance. The method was not\nfound satisfactory.\n\" 4. The method of selection of one of two paired records (7th and 8th\nSeries). Each subject was given two records\u2014one being his own and the\nother one a '\ncontrol '\nrecord belonging to another subject, without his\nknowing which was which\u2014and he was asked to decide by general impres-\nsion which one, considered as a whole, was his. The method did not prove\nsatisfactory, but it was decided to try it again in a modified form.\n\" 5. In a modification of the method just referred to, all items were\ngiven in advance different values, i, 2, and 3 (9th Series). As the results\nwere not satisfactory, the idea of selecting one of two paired records was\nultimately abandoned, but it was thought worth while to test again the\nmethod of evaluation [i.e. the above method of scoring an item i, 2, or 3\naccording to how specific it is] in a longer series, in spite of the objection\nto its being arbitrary. This was done in connection with the next method.\n\" 6. The method ofpaired items (loth Series). According to this method\neach item given by the sensitive was paired with a control item, and the\nsubject was asked to select the one which was substantially more applicable\nthan the other, unless both were equally well or not at all applicable, in\nwhich cases they were both accepted or both rejected. The control\nitems were taken from '\nguess-lists '\nobtained by tabulating the items\npreviously given by the sensitive, in three separate groups, valued i, 2,\nand 3 respectively.\n\flyy] Experimental Object-Reading : A Critical Review 2i\n\" It was, however, found that evaluation did not change the character\nof the resuhs. In view of this finding, the idea of evaluation was aban-\ndoned in the subsequent series.\n\" 7. A modification of the method of paired items was introduced in the\nnth and 12th Series, according to which the items were no longer paired\nwith control items obtained from '\nguess-lists ', but with the items given\nto another subject at the same sitting. The method proved to be very\nconvenient and satisfactory.\n\" Summarizing the above comments on the latter control methods,\n(i to 7) employed for establishing a statistical proof of the probable exis-\ntence of an ultra-perceptive faculty in connection with '\npsychometry ',\nthe method of admixed control items, such as used in the 4th Series, and the\nmethod of paired items without evaluation, such as used in the nth and\nI2th Series, seem to be the best ones for the purpose in view.\"\nIn every one of the experiments in which controls were used the sub-\njects showed a tendency to pick out their own items rather than the\ncontrols. The 622* readings obtained in the main series (Nos. 4-12)\ncontained 6,631 items. The number correctly selected by the subjects\nwas 2,570, while the number of control items selected was 1,913. The\ndeviation, according to Hettinger's calculations, is 28-6 x its probable\nerror, or 19-1 x its standard deviation, which is very highly significant.\nAt first sight these results might appear to provide overwhelming evi-\ndence for the existence of what Hettinger calls \" the ultra-perceptive\nfaculty \". A closer examination, however, reveals that the work is vitiated\nby a very large number of errors.\nThe majority of these are errors of experimental method, whereby\nHettinger has failed to rule out various normal factors which may have\noperated either to produce a positive result themselves or to exaggerate the\nsignificance of any positive result obtained. Unfortunately we are unable\nto deduce from the information provided by Hettinger which, if any, of\nthese factors were operating : we can only say that, with the given data,\nany of them may have been present, and that the evidence is insufficient\nto demonstrate that the results have a paranormal explanation.\nA few of Hettinger's errors, however, are more definite than this : in\nhis use of statistics we can point to some clear mistakes and make a\ncorrection to the results to allow for them.\n\/\/. Errors in Hettinger's use of statistics.\nLet us start with two surprisingly elementary statistical errors.\nFirst, the use of empirical probabilities in calculating the standard\ndeviation.\nLet iS be the number of originals! and C the number of controls accepted\nby the subject in a given batch of data.\nLet A'^ = 5 + C be the total number of items (or readings) accepted.\n\u2022 The table on p. 115 gives this figure as 623. This appears to be an error (see\nbelow, p. 27, footnote).\nt I propose to avoid much circumlocution by using the noun \" original \" as the\nopposite of \" control \". An \" original \" item or reading is one actually given by\nthe medium as applying to the subject who is annotating the record.\n\f22 Christopher Scott [Part\nIn nearly every case the originals and controls are equal in number.\nFurthermore, we may assume, for the moment, that the originals and\ncontrols have exactly equal antecedent probabilities of acceptance.\nHettinger departs (quite legitimately) from custom by working with the\ndeviation of the fraction from its expected value of \\, instead of with\nthe deviation of S from its expected value of \\N. The standard deviation,\nassuming a binomial distribution (see p. 25) is therefore given by\nN '\nwhere p, q are the probabilities of choosing originals and controls.\nNow the correct procedure (as nearly always in psychical research) is\nto assume the null hypothesis that only chance is operating, and to deter-\nmine on this hypothesis how large a coincidence would be necessary to\ngive the results which we have in fact obtained. And clearly in this case\nthe assumption that chance alone is operating in the subject's choice\nmeans that there is an equal probability of the subject's selecting originals\nand controls, i.e. that p = q = ^, so that we have\na =\n1\nN 2JN'\nHettinger, however, for a reason that he does not adequately explain,\nuses not the theoretical values of p and q but the values determined\nS C\nempirically from the results obtained, i.e. \/)=-^, q=j^. This is incon-\nsistent. Either we work from the null hypothesis and proceed as above,\nor we base our calculations entirely on empirical results, in which case\nS S\nthe expected value of ^ is not ^ but , and there is no deviation at all.\nHettinger calculates the mean theoretically and the standard deviation\nempirically. There is clearly no justification for this.\nIs X C\nHettinger's method gives a = y , which is always less than or equal\nto the correct value, so that the significance is overestimated.\nThe error increases as the significance increases, but in practice it is\nseldom large. (Incidentally, on Hettinger's method, if the subject gets\n100 per cent success the significance of the result becomes infinite.)\nBy a rather similar confusion of the use of theoretical and empirical\nprobabilities Hettinger is led to put forward a very remarkable argument\nwhich appears to imply that in every experiment where there is an observed\ndeviation from a mean, one is justified in doubling that deviation.\nThe argument seems to be as follows :\nUsing the same notation as above, ~ is the \" empirical probability\nfor the controls \" or the \" empirical probability of coincidence \".\n\f177] Experimental Object-Reading : A Critical Review 23\nThe relevant deviation, therefore, is the deviation of ^ not from \\,\nQ\nthe theoretical probabiUty of coincidence, but from ^, the observed\nC\nprobabihty of coincidence. Since is less than \\ by the same amount\nS\nthat is greater than \\, this means in effect that we can double any\ndeviation we find.\nIt is hardly necessary to explain the absurdity of this argument. Per-\nhaps the simplest reply would be as follows :\nIf is the \" probabihty of coincidence \", what is\n^? Presumably\nthe probability of success ; i.e. the probable proportion of successes is\n^ . But the observed proportion of successes is Hence the obser\\'ed\nproportion equals the probable proportion, so that the deviation from\nchance is precisely zero.\nThe argument is manifestly absurd, but it is a direct extension of the\nargument used by Hettinger to enable him to double his deviation.\nOf course, despite the absurdity of Hettinger's argument, it would be\nS C\nlegitimate to use the deviation of ^ from instead of from |, provided\none used the standard deviation of this new variate and not that of the old\none. Since the new standard deviation, like the new observed deviation,\nwould be just Uvice the old one, this procedure would have no effect at\nall on the final anti-chance probability.\nA further statistical error arises in Hettinger's use of \" the method of\nevaluation \". In series 9, 10, and 11 an attempt is made to \" evaluate\n\"\nthe various items so as to take account, in the statistical results, of the\nvarying degrees of significance of the items and to give more w-eight to\nthose items whose acceptance is clearly antecedently less probable.\nObviously such a procedure, if a valid statistical method can be worked\nout, is very desirable. Hettinger's method is to score every item (originals\nand controls) either i, 2, or 3, before the annotator marks it, according to\nhow specific it is. Items of a general character are marked i, specific\nitems 2, and exceptional items 3. When the subject has annotated the\nreading, the total score on the accepted items is added up ( = A^', say) and\nthe chance probability is calculated on the basis of an expectation of\nIN' and a standard deviation of JN'pq, where p and q are the probabilities\nof correct and incorrect choices by the subject.\nBut this is erroneous. The expectation is correct, but the standard\ndeviation is too small and leads to an exaggeration of the significance of\nthe results. The correct way of applying the method of evaluation is a\nlittle more complicated and has to take into account the number of items\nput into each class.* However, as long as we use the correct formulae we\n* If the number of items given the score, or \" weight \", is n^, \/ = i, 2, . . . s,\ns *\nand if 2 n, =N, the correct variance for a binomial distribution is pq 2 \u00ab,^t)^^\n\f24 Chiistoplier Scott [Part\nmay proceed as Hettinger does (or more arbitrarily if we wish\u2014in fact\nwe may be as arbitrary as we like) in assigning scores to the various items\nbefore annotation.\nIt must be admitted that Hettinger says more than once that the\nmethod of evaluation he uses is arbitrary and that he does not consider it\nsatisfactory : he uses it, apparently, \" only tentatively, by way of experi-\nment \". Although it is difficult to see what results of any value this\n\" experiment \" could have\u2014the trouble with the method, after all, is not\nthat it has no effect on the results, but that any effect it might have would\nbe illegitimate\u2014it would scarcely be reasonable to criticize Hettinger on\nthis score. I would, therefore, not have mentioned the matter of Hettin-\nger's use of evaluation if it were not that, despite his repeated expressions\nof doubt as to the method's validity in 1938, he uses the same method (or\none rather like it and just as invalid) as the ojily method of scoring in the\ntransatlantic experiments of 1945-6 (series i). It is therefore pertinent\nto Hettinger's work as a whole to point out that the method of evaluation\nwhich he uses is statistically quite inadmissible, and to provide the formula\nwhich he should have used.\nAnother serious objection to Hettinger's application of the method of\nevaluation is that the items are classed by Hettinger himself, who knows\nwhich are originals and which controls. Since the standard by which an\nitem is judged to be \" specific \" is necessarily very arbitrary, it is clear\nthat this method is dangerously open to the influence of any bias Hettinger\nmay have. It would have been safer to leave the evaluation to the subject,\nwho did not know the originals from the controls, and to use a statistical\nmethod which would make it impossible for any arbitrariness in evalu-\nation to give a spurious significance.\nA rather more complicated problem arises over the question of whether\nwe should deal with the number of items which the subjects choose\ncorrectly or the number of records in which they score higher on the\noriginals than the controls. Hettinger gives the results for both methods.\nIt is clear that the second is very wasteful, and therefore insensitive ;\nbut,\nunfortunately, there are a number of objections to using the first. Consider\nfor example series 7, 8, and 9 where the subject is presented with two\nseparate readings, one original and one control, and asked to mark every\nitem as applicable or not applicable. If we use, as Hettinger does, the\nstraightforward method of adding up the number of original items accepted\nand the number of control items accepted in all the records of a series\nand dealing with the totals by the ordinary statistical procedure, we are\nmaking the assumption that the items constitute a random population of\n50 per cent originals and 50 per cent controls. In fact, of course, nothing\nof the sort is true. The subjects know that the items of a given reading\nare either all originals or all controls. A subject, therefore, who took\nfull advantage of this knowledge would not worry about choosing between\nitems, he would merely choose the reading which he thought to apply and\nmark all the items on that reading as applicable and all those on the\nand for a hypergeometric distribution (see p. 26) is\n\f177] Experimental Object-Reading: A Critical Review 25\nother inapplicable. In this way he would have a fifty-fifty chance of getting\nall the items right\u2014a chance which the straightforward statistical pro-\ncedure applied to the items-scores would represent as more than 1,000 to i.\nBoth Hettinger* and Westf have shown in their studies of bias that this is,\nin fact, to a considerable extent what actually happens. { Of course the\neffect cuts both ways, and the objection is not that it leads to a spurious\npositive result but that it causes the significance of any result that may be\nobtained to be overestimated. If the effect were working at its maximum\nand if there are 12 items in a reading, evaluation by means of the items-\nscores assuming a binomial distribution would cause the critical ratio to\nbe multiplied by J\\2, i.e. about 3-5. This would mean, for example,\nthat a result which is at about the i in 20 level of significance could be\nrepresented as having a chance probability of i in a million million.\nPotentially, therefore, the error is very serious indeed, so that in using the\nmethod of presenting pairs of readings to the subject it is important to\navoid applymg to the items-scores any statistical method which assumes,\nas does Hettinger's in series 7, 8, and 9, that the items are not grouped\ntogether. Much the simplest and safest procedure is to work with the\nnumber of readings correctly chosen.\u00a7\nFrom the statistical point of view the substance of this objection is that\nHettinger has assumed a binomial distribution for the items-scores when\nthe grouping of the items into readings makes this assumption false.\nThe objection therefore only applies to series 7, 8, and 9 where such\ngrouping takes place.\nThere is, however, another reason why the assumption of a binomial\ndistribution for the items-scores is certainly false for all series except 10,\nII, and 12. The variate with which Hettinger works is the number R of\noriginals chosen by the subject from a record containing n items, \\n of\nwhich are originals and \\n controls. Now, except in series 10, 11, and 12,\nwhere original and control items are paired together, the distribution of\nsuch a variate is very far from binomial\u2014quite apart from the point\nraised above about series 7, 8, and 9. It is not very difficult to see why :\nthe binomial distribution assumes that the chance that the next item chosen\nfrom a record will be an original is quite independent of how many ori-\nginals have already been chosen from that record. But this is clearly\nfalse. Suppose a certain record contains 10 original and 10 control items,\nand suppose that the annotator is in the process of considering the record\nand has already accepted 9 items as applicable, and that every one of these\n9 is in fact an original. What is the chance of the next item to be accepted\nbeing an original? The binomial distribution assumes that it is an even\nchance. But in fact it is a chance of 10 to i against, since among the 11\nitems remaining to be considered there is only i original. Thus it is in\nfact much more difficult to get a very high score\u2014or equally, a very low one\n\u2014than a binomial distribution supposes. This means that the assumption\n* The Ultra-Perceptive Faculty, p. 46.\nt Unpublished study.\nX A statistical analysis of the figures for series 7, 8, and 9 indicates that on the\naverage this bias alone determines the subject's decision about the item in three\nitems out of every five.\n\u00a7 Methods of dealing legitimately with items-scores exist, but as they are cum-\nbersome and rather complicated they will not be discussed here.\n\f26 Christopher Scott [Part\nof a binomial distribution leads to an Mwd'f'r-estimation of the significance\nof the results.\nThe correct distribution is called hypergeometric, and its variance\ndepends on the total number of items accepted as applicable from the\nrecord being considered. If we call this number A, then the hyper-\ngeometric variance is \\A {n - A)j {n - i). It will be seen that this is never\ngreater than the binomial variance ^A.\nIn Hettinger's data the number A is variable but averages about \u00ab\/3,\nwhich means that the variance should be reduced by about 30 per cent,\nand the critical ratio increased by about 15 per cent. The effect on the\nchance probability of this error of Hettinger is therefore appreciable\n\u2014and could be quite serious if the average number of items accepted\nper record were rather larger. Thus it seems worth mentioning as an\nimportant point to be noticed if any attempt is to be made to repeat an\ninvestigation of this sort. However, the error is on the safe side and does\nnot vitiate Hettinger's method but merely detracts somewhat from its\nsensitivity.\nThe correct (hypergeometric) variance can be worked out in every case\nfrom the data supplied by Hettinger {A=R + W), and this particular error\ncorrected. In series 10, 11, and 12, however, where original and control\nitems are paired together, the distribution of the variate R, defined as the\nnumber of pairs in which the right member is accepted, is truly binomial\n(that is, neglecting other objections to be raised below).*\nSince for the moment we are only concerned with purely statistical\ndifliculties I shall leave till later (see below, p. 34) the discussion of\nfurther objection to dealing with items rather than readings. It would\nperhaps be wise to repeat that in the above criticisms the objections to\ndealing with items is not that one might obtain a spurious positive effect,\nbut that any effect one does obtain, whether positive or negative, may have\nits significance exaggerated.\nAnother statistical error which operates against a significant result\nshould be mentioned. If one is classifying each reading as either a\n\" success \" or a \" failure \" according to whether more originals or more\ncontrols have been accepted from it by the subject, the question arises :\nwhat should one do with readings in which the subject accepts equal\nnumbers of originals and controls? Hettinger's practice is variable. In\nseries 4, 10, 1 1 and 12, he puts these borderline cases with the \" failures \",\nbut in series 7 and 8, he rejects them from the experiment altogether for the\npurpose of evaluation (the remaining series are not evaluated statistically).\nI am unable to understand Hettinger's arguments for these changes in\nmethod, but it seems to me quite clear that the latter method is always\nvalid.\nThe same question arises over items, instead of readings, in series 10,\nII, and 12. Here the items are paired together, one original and one\ncontrol, on the record sent to the subject for annotation, and the subject\nis asked to mark each item Yes or No. Now in practice this does not\nalways mean that the subject marks one from each pair Yes and one No.\n* The hypergeometric distribution is the special of what is known to some\npsychical researchers as the \" Stevens formulae \" arising when there are only two\ndifferent kmds of target\n\u2014\nm this case, originals and controls.\n\flyy] Experimental Object-Reading: A Critical Review 27\nOften he marks both Yes or both No. Hettinger, continuing his practice\nin the eadier series of giving scores only for Yeses, counts one right and\none wrong when the subject says Yes, Yes, to a pair, and gives no score\nwhen the subject says No, No. Obviously a more sensitive scoring pro-\ncedure would have been to reject all cases where the subject says Yes to\nboth or No to both and to deal only with the cases where he said Yes to\none and No to the other.\nThe procedure of not taking into account the borderline cases is equi-\nvalent to what is known as \" free matching \" in experiments with drawings\nand it is difficult to see why one should not always take advantage of it.\nBy putting the borderline cases with the \" failures \" Hettinger unneces-\nsarily squanders the significance he has amassed.\n\/\/\/. Summary of results with statistical errors corrected.\nWe have now come to the end of Hettinger's statistical lapses,* and it\nwould perhaps be helpful to give an interim report of the results with all\nthe necessary statistical corrections made. In the table on p. 28,\n1. The standard deviations are calculated on the basis of the theoretical\nprobabilities, p = \\, q = \\-\n2. Hettinger's \" statistical correction of the results \" which leads to a\ndoubling of the deviation is omitted.\n3. In view of difficulties already discussed and another to be discussed\nbelow (p. 34), the results for each series are evaluated on the basis of the\nnumber of successful readings, and not the number of items correctly\nchosen.\n4. The \" method of evaluation \" for giving more weight to the more\nspecific items is not used.\n5. The method of rejecting borderline cases is used wherever possible.\nIt will be seen from this table that, serious as Hettinger's statistical\nerrors are, they are not themselves sufficient to account for the results.\nCorrect statistical analysis of the material provided gives a figure which,\nthough not so high as Hettinger believes, is still overwhelmingly significant.\nIV. Errors of method.\nWhile Hettinger's statistical errors are, so far as I know, peculiar to\nhimself, his errors of experimental design are of more general importance,\nfor at least one of them is to be found in almost every attempt that has\nbeen made at objective evaluation of the mental phenomena of medium-\nship. t A critical discussion of these errors will therefore have the\n* Two numerical mistakes should also be mentioned. The figure 948 which\nappears twice on p. 53 should almost certainly be 912. This increases by 1-4 and\n1-3 respectively the two percentages which follow, but does not affect any of the\ncalculations. On p. 76, Table \" F \", for the right selection (Rs) the number of\nrecords for which i?\/PF<i is 6 and not 5, and the number for which RjW =1 is 3\nand not 5. This alters the figure for the number of right selections from 71 to 70.\nThe effect on the results is negligible.\nt I can exclude only some of West's experiments (unpublished) in object-reading\nand Hettinger's scrap-book method modified as described below (p. 47), though the\nformer seem nevertheless to be open to other considerably less serious criticisms.\nHowever, both of these investigations produced negative results.\n\f28 Christopher Scott [Part\nSuccesses Failures Critical\nSeries \" Sensitive\n\"* (readings) (readings) Ratio, X Probability, Pf\nIT K 50 19 37 \u20220002\n5 K 9 2 \u2014\n6 K 8 5\n7 K 28 16 1*7 \u2022oq\n8 K 26 27\nF 70 27 \u2022007\nQ K 4 \u2014\nF 6 2 \u2014 \u2014\nlO K 20 18\nF 32 H 2-6 \u2022009\nII K II 9\nF 40 19 27 \u2022007\n12 K ID 7\n\u2014\nF 28 16 17 \u202209\nTotals K 167 107 3-6 \u20220003\nF 176 92 5-0 6 X io\"''\u00a7\nTotal F and K 343 199 6-i|| io-\u00ab\u00a7\nadditional constructive function of pointing the way to the design of a fool-\nproof technique in experimental object-reading.\nWe come now therefore to a consideration of some errors which are not\npurely mathematical but depend, to varying degrees, on the nature of\nthe items and on the details of Hettinger's experimental procedure.\nThe central difficulty in the design of an objective method is to provide\ncontrols which are exactly like the originals in every respect except that\nthey are not in fact originals. This presents considerable difficulties.\nThe following are the sources of error that have to be avoided :\n1. The controls must not be systematically more specific, or in any\nother way antecedently less likely to be accepted, than the originals.\n2. The originals must not have some quality in common (such as sub-\nject matter, style, etc.) which the controls lack.\n* Hettinger worked with two sensitives, Mrs F. Kingstone (K) and Miss F. Fal-\nJows (F).\nt Probabilities less than -05 are usually considered \" significant \".\nX Series i and 2 are purely exploratory and do not make use of serious control\nmethods.

Hettinger's figure of 191. About two-thirds of this discrepancy is due\nto Hettinger's \" statistical correction \" leading to a doubling of the deviation.\nThe remainder is chiefly caused by the insensitivity of working with whole readings\nrather than with items. A fairer estimate of the significance, based on items-scores\nand not assuming independence of items, but not completely reliable since, in theory\nat least, it requires the unjustifiable assumption of a normal distribution and one\nwhich is not \" faked \" by the subject, is provided by Student's t test applied to the\ndifferences between the number of originals and the number of controls accepted\nfrom each reading. This gives a t (equivalent to a critical ratio) of 8-8.\n\flyy] Experimental Object-Reading: A Critical Review 29\n3. The originals must have no observable connection with the article\n\"that the controls lack.\n4. There must be no possibility of the subject recognising controls as\nitems given to him to annotate on earlier records.\n5. The controls must not be selected by anyone who knows who the\nsubject is unless they are selected by a truly random method.\nThere is no evidence that Hettinger has made any conscious attempt to\nfulfil any of these conditions except the fifth. Let us consider them in turn.\nI. The possibility that the controls may be antecedently less likely of\nacceptance than the originals arises in series 4 and 10, where the control\nitems are taken from the items given at earlier sittings. There are a\nnumber of ways in which this might happen, {a) As the series of experi-\nments proceeds the mediums may become less and less specific in their\nstatements. Such a change is psychologically very plausible when we\nconsider that these no doubt rather tedious tests continued for nearly 3^\nyears, {b) Some of the items given by the medium may be related to\ntopical events or conditions. In this way the originals would have an\nadvantage over the controls. Thus if the item, \" Been somewhere\nrecently where there was a heavy fall of snow \" had appeared in a reading\ngiven during the summer or autumn it would certainly have been rejected\nas being a control, (r) The sensitive \" F \" was introduced in series 8. The\npossibility arises that her success in series 10 may have been partially\ncaused by a tendency on her part to give items which are less specific\nthan those of \" K \". Perhaps this would account for the greater success\nof the medium \" F \". {d) A further danger arises in series 4, 6, 10, 11,\nand 12. In these series the number of items per record is fixed by\nHettinger. There are equal numbers of originals and controls on the\nrecord to be annotated and the numbers of originals are :\nIn series 4 :\n12\n\u201e \u201e 6 : 8, 10, or 12\n\u201e \u201e 10, II and 12 :\n10*\nNow Hettinger does not tell us how he managed to fix the number of\nitems per record. Anyone who has experience of sittings for object-reading\nwill know that a medium may give anything from four to twenty items on\ndifferent objects. Did Hettinger urge his sensitives to give more until\nthe correct number was reached? If so, might they not, once they had given\nall they wished, resort to vaguer and more general items? In series such\nas the 4th and loth where the controls came from earlier series in which\nthis process of \" squeezing \" the medium for more items had not been\napplied, the originals might well in this way get a higher antecedent\nprobability of acceptance than the controls. And what happened when the\nmedium had given the required number of items and began to give more?\nDid Hettinger stop her? Those who have experience of mediums will\nbe reluctant to believe that Hettinger could have done so while continuing\nto hold her cooperation.f Did he cease to record the items as soon as the\n* It is not entirely clear from the text whether or not the number of items per\nrecord is fixed in these three series. However, from the specimen record on p. 89\nand the figures given on pp. 88, 94, 103, 104, for the aggregate number of items it\nseems almost certain that it was fixed at 10.\nt Dr Hettinger has since informed me that this is, in fact, what he did.\nI\n\f3\u00a9 Christopher Scott [Part j 15\nrequired number had been given, or record them but discard them after- f\nwards?

Such a procedure would be dangerously arbitrary, !\nj\nand would lead to considerable possibilities for manipulating the results 1\n\u2014whether consciously or unconsciously. | ]\nHettinger's reticence in his book about all this is very unfortunate. '\nThe procedure of fixing the number of items per record is riddled with i\npossibilities for error. From the account given by Hettinger there is no 1\nevidence to show that these possibilities were even seen, much less j\nguarded against. 1\n{e) A further query arises over series 10. Here we are told that the\ncontrol items were taken from a \" guess-list \" made up of some of the\nitems previously given. It is natural to ask, which} Unfortunately\nHettinger is not explicit on the point. Whatever Hettinger's method of\nchoosing which items to put in the list it is important to know whether\nhis procedure might have resulted in items on the \" guess-list \" being\nmore specific than the average.\nAgain, this guess-list was made by tabulating items previously given the\nvalues I, 2, or 3 in the \" method of evaluation \". Hettinger does not\nsay so explicitly, but presumably the purpose of this tabulation was to\npair a control from one of these three classes with an original falling into\nthe same class. But whether or not this was the procedure it is certain\nthat Hettinger (or whoever was selecting the controls from the list) could\nsee which controls he was selecting, so that we cannot be certain that his\nchoice of the controls was not affected by bias. This difficulty was avoided\nin series 4, where a \" guess-box \" was used, containing all the items pre-\nviously given, from which the typing assistant drew the controls to be\nused. !\n2. Similarly Hettinger seems to have overlooked the possibility that the i\noriginal items may have had some quality in common (such as subject\nmatter, style, etc.) which the controls lacked. This difficulty might arise\nin series 4 or 10 where the controls, unlike the originals, did not form a\nsingle reading. The possibility of style providing the clue to the originals\nmight arise with only one medium if her style were variable, but is more\nlikely to cause serious trouble where two or more mediums are being used.\nIn series 4, there was only one medium : in series 10 there were two,\nthough apparently (the text is not very clear on the point) the controls\n\"\nwere taken from series 9, in which there were also two mediums, so that,\nassuming styles remain constant, the style of the \" original \" medium\n\f177] Experimental Object-Reading : A Critical Review 31\nwould also appear in the controls, though only in about half of them.\nThe effect, therefore, is not very likely to be a serious one, though it must\nbe considered as a possibility. Subject matter is a much more probable\nclue.\n3. Hettinger attempted to rule out the possibility of normal deductions\nabout the owners from the objects by always (\" with few exceptions \")\nenclosing the objects in sealed envelopes. We are also told that \" in the\ncase of one of the sensitives, most of the tests were carried out without\nher touching the envelopes \". In view of the striking superiority of the\nmedium \" F \" over \" K \" when they are competing it is a pity that\nHettinger does not say which of the mediums this statement refers to.\nThis appears to be a case where Hettinger quite needlessly provokes the\nsuspicious reader, for in his second book. Exploring the Ultra-Perceptive\nFaculty, he makes it quite clear that it was \" F \", the more successful\nmedium, who did not handle the envelopes and \" K \" who did. In series\nII and 12, we are told, neither medium handled the envelopes : they\n\" were placed on a table or chair and the sensitives concentrated on them\nat a distance of about two feet \". It should be realised that though a\nsealed envelope usually conceals the detailed characteristics of an object\nit does not always\u2014and hardly ever if handled\u2014conceal the nature of the\nobject ; and a certain amount (particularly sex, age, etc.) can be deduced\nfrom the nature of an object, especially if the subjects voluntarily submit\nobjects for experiment. Of course there is no need to suppose that the\nsensitive is playing this game alone.* The subject, on his side, can do\nmuch to help the results by picking out items or readings which seem to\nhim likely to have been given on the object he has submitted. (Even if\nsi he has submitted several objects he would probably know on which of\n\" them any particular reading was given, as the nature of the object is\nt\nwritten at the top of the specimen records reproduced in the book.\nUnfortunately Hettinger does not make it clear whether this information\nwas provided before or after the subject made his annotation.) It might\nperhaps be objected that this hypothesis makes rather unreasonably harsh\nassumptions about the ethical standards of Hettinger's subjects. For mji\nown part I do not think it does. From our point of view as researchers\ntrying to work towards the truth, deliberate sabotage of this sort does\nperhaps seem unethical. But it must be remembered that, as Hettinger\nsays, the subjects were \" of most varied occupations and temperaments,\nincluding a number of King's College students \".j It is surely not very\ndifficult to imagine that many such subjects, having no interest in psychical\nresearch, would regard the whole affair as something of a farce, but a farce\nwhich presents a rather interesting puzzle to be solved. In any case even\nif we assume that all the subjects were wholly well-intentioned, we have\nample evidence from Hettinger's own study of bias that a well-intentioned\nperson may behave in a way that would appear to the naive as deliberately\ndishonest. Intentions count for little where the will to believe is strong.\n* It is difficult when discussing questions of this sort not to seem to imply that\nthe medium is necessarily a conscious fraud. I must emphasise that (at any rate\nfor the present part of the discussion) I consider such a hypothesis both superfluous\nand unlikely.\n+ Series i and 4 each involved 63 subjects. We are not told how many subjects\ntook part altogether in the whole work.\n\f'\nil(\n32 Christopher Scott [Pari\n4. The possibility that the subject may recognize controls as such\nbecause he has seen them before\u2014either on his own records or on some-\none else's\u2014arises in series 4 and 10 where the controls are taken from\nitems given on earlier sittings. Dr Hettinger has told me personally that\nhe did not consider it necessary to take precautions against this possibility.\nWhile I agree with Hettinger that it will certainly affect only a small\nproportion of the items, it seems to me that in two long series such as\nthese, involving over 3,000 items altogether, it would have been wiser to\nhave taken precautions to ensure that nothing of this sort could occur.\nAs things stand it is almost impossible to estimate the probable magnitude\nof this error.\n5. The condition that the controls must be selected by a random\nmethod or by someone who does not know who the subject is seems to\nhave been fulfilled in series 4, where the controls are taken from a guess-\nbox, containing all items previously given, by the typing assistant. Pro-\nvided we can assume the bona fides of this anonymous assistant this\nmethod appears\u2014at any rate in this respect\u2014to be unexceptionable. In\nseries 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, a \" compensating \" method is used ; the items from\na reading applying to the subject Sj^ are the controls for the record sent\nto S2, and the items on this record applying to S., are the controls for the\nrecord sent to Sj, i.e. and S., are sent the same pair of readings, and the\ncontrol for one is the original for the other. This procedure avoids the\npossibility of any general difference in quality between controls and\noriginals, but it still leaves an opening for bias if the person deciding\nwhich readings are to be paired together knows who the subjects are.\nFor example, if one of the subjects has red hair and one of the items given\non a reading not applying to him was \" this person has red hair \", the\nperson making up the records for annotation could reduce the chance of\nthe red-haired subject selecting the wrong reading by ensuring that this\nitem does not appear as one of his controls but is allocated to someone\nelse's record. There is here, then, ample opportunity for bias to vitiate\nthe results if the originals and controls are paired by someone who knows :\nf\nthe subjects. Unfortunately we are not told who did this pairing. In I\nJ\nseries 10 a \" guess-list \" of controls is used. Again, we are not told who 'i\nselected the controls from this list. In series 11 and 12, the genuines are J\npaired \" with the items given to another subject at the same sitting \".\nIt is not clear whether this means that a true compensating method was\nbeing used, that is, that each reading was used as a control once and once\nonly, but it is evident that where an odd number of readings was given at\na sitting this could not have been done by simply putting the readings\ntogether in pairs. Unless Hettinger was taking great care over this point\n\u2014and he gives no suggestion that he was\u2014it seems likely that some of\nthe readings were used twice as controls. If this is so, the method does not\ncompletely succeed in ruling out, by compensation, the possibility of\nthere being a general difference in quality between controls and originals,\nand is therefore open to the influence of bias. And even if Hettinger did\ntake care to see that no reading was used twice as a control, the method is\nopen to the same criticisms as were raised above against series 5 to 9.\nIn all the series except the 4th, therefore, we need to know : {a) Who\nchose the controls? {b) Did this person know the subjects? To the first\n\f'a\n[77] Experimental Object-Reading: A Critical Review 33\nquestion we find no answer in the book, though it seems reasonably Ukely\nm that it was Hettinger.* If it was not, we have no answer to the second\nroi juestion. If it was, we must inquire about Hettinger's knowledge of the\ntk subjects. The evidence on this point does not seem entirely consistent,\nliti Jut its general import is clear. On p. 75 Hettinger says, \" Quite a number\nM af the subjects were well known to (me).\" On p. 172 we read, \" The\n11 sxperimenter, too, was completely ignorant with respect to the bulk of\nrt items given, viz. as to whether they were applicable or not and in many\ncm lases he did not even know the subjects.\" While on p. 149 we find, \" A\niiJ subject who is very quick or very slow will almost invariably produce the\nresponse (from the sensitive) :\n'\nI sense a quick vibration,' or '\nI am in\nbi touch with a slow vibration '. Many of the personal characteristics, such\nil JS a peculiar way of laughing, of moving the hands, of talking, of sitting,\nesi Jtc, are often imitated, almost to perfection.\" (My italics). It seems\n'ro reasonable to take this last statement as a mild exaggeration and to con-\nthi elude that Hettinger knew the majority of the subjects to some extent but\nI anly a few of them very well.\n01 In any case our conclusion is clear : if Hettinger chose the controls\nffl Ji series 5-12, there was ample opportunity for bias to affect his choice,\ntt So much for Hettinger's methods of providing controls. In the course\ntil\nof a necessarily rather tedious discussion I have proposed a large number\ntl of possible hypotheses which might explain some of Hettinger's results\nwithout resort to the paranormal. Unfortunately these all remain hypo-\ntheses. Perhaps Hettinger's most serious fault is that he does not give us\nenough information to enable us to judge whether or not these hypotheti-\ncal explanations have any basis in fact. All that we can say on the available\ndata is that any of these things might have occurred.\nThe relevant evidence on the criticisms I have made is all quoted in the\nabove discussion except for five specimen records which are provided in\n'\nthe book, one each from series 2, 4, and 10, and a pair from series 7.\nUnfortunately none of these comes from the more successful medium\nF and only one (that from series 4) can really be said to be selected from\na group which gives significant positive results. This scanty evidence\nthrows further light on only one of the criticisms that have been made :\nthe possibility of a normal connection between the object and the items\ngiven on it. On pp. 67, 68, we are shown a pair of readings, one given on\na wallet and one on a ring. The latter is a specifically feminine reading,\nwhile the former might apply to a man or woman. This suggests the possi-\nbility that the medium gave a feminine reading for a feminine object, and\nthat the female subject selected it and the male rejected it chiefly on these\ngrounds. But only one example cannot tell us much ;\nthis hypothesis\nremains, like the others, unproved and un-disproved.\nI shall now pass on to a few further criticisms before I attempt to sum\nup the results of this investigation and give a verdict.\n(a) We have already seen that mathematical considerations alone,\nregardless of the nature of the items, make it inconvenient to base the\nstatistical calculations on the number of items accepted rather than on the\nnumber of readings. We shall now consider a further objection which\nmakes this procedure unreliable. The danger is that the items of one\n* Dr Hettinger has now informed me that it was.\n\f34 Christopher Scott -\n[Part\nreading may not be independent of one another, so that if the annotator\nsees, in a record containing originals and randomly selected controls, two:\nitems which seem to be connected he can infer that they are both originals.\nWhen the controls (as well as the originals) come from a single reading\nthis difficulty does not arise, but another takes its place : if the annotator\nnow sees two connected items he will know that (probably) they are either\nboth originals or both controls, while two contradictory items must be one\noriginal and one control. Now the statistical analysis which we would\nnormally apply to the number of original and control items selected makes\nthe assumption that the acceptance of each item is entirely independent\nof the acceptance of any other. If the items are connected in the way\nsuggested above, this assumption is false. In theory it might be possible\nfor an annotator to group all the items into two groups. He would know,\nthat all the members of one group are controls and all those of the other\noriginals, but he would not know which group was which. Suppose he\nmakes a guess. He has a 50-50 chance of doing so correctly. Suppose\nhe succeeds. Clearly this is not significant. Yet if we were working with\nItems only (and supposing there are 12 originals and 12 controls in the\nrecord) we would observe only that he had got 24 items out of 24 right,\nwhich is statistically highly significant. In practice, of course, the anno-\ntator IS not hkely to be able to make such a successful division of the items\ninto two groups. But as long as we are unable to estimate how successfully\nthe grouping might have been made the safest procedure is to work as\nthough It could be done with complete success\u2014z.e. to deal not with items\nbut with whole readings.*\nHettinger appears to have overlooked this difficulty entirely. There is\nno evidence that he attempted to group together as one item items which\nwere clearly interdependent.\n{b) In series 7, 8, and 9, the method was to send a pair of readings given\non two different objects to the two owners of the objects, to see if each\ncould pick out his own. A number of questions arise. In the first place\nIS the specimen pair of records shown on pp. 67, 68, an actual copy of the\noriginal records sent out for annotation.? The specimen records contain :\nfirst a column of items ;\non the right of this a column for annotations by\nthe owner of one of the objects ; and on the right of this a similar column\nfor the owner of the other object. The specimen records are reproduced\nwith the subjects' annotations filled in. The first observation to be made\nis that in the first specimen record shown, containing items given on a\nwallet, the two columns for annotations are : for the owner of the wallet\non the left ;\nfor the owner of the ring, on the right ; while in the second\nrecord, containing items given on the ring, the column for the owner of\nthe ring comes on the left, and the column for the owner of the wallet on\nthe right. In other words, in both records the first {i.e. left-hand) of the\ntwo columns for annotation belongs to the true owner. I do not wish to\nover-emphasise the significance of this fact. It may well be merely a curious\ncoincidence. But we must recognize the possibility that this procedure\n\u00ab Of course the effect works both ways. As I have already said, the objections\nto deahng with items are not that we might obtain a spurious positive effect but\nthat any etTect we do obtain, whether positive or negative, may have its significance\nexaggerated. ^\n\f177] Experimental Object-Reading: A Critical Review 35\nmay have been regular throughout these three series. If it was, the results\nmust, of course, be rejected as quite invalid. It is almost a certainty that\nsome of the subjects, presented, probably several times, with such a pair\nof records, would make the deduction (or discover by trial and error) that\ntheir record was the one in which their annotation column came first.\nAnd even if they did not it is probable that there would be a bias (i) for\nmaking such a choice, or (ii) for annotating first the reading in which one's\nown column comes first. In the latter case the reader has only to consider\nthe probable behaviour of an optimistic subject in marking to see that we\nmight expect a bias in favour of accepting the reading first marked.\nA second important question is, did the annotators work independently\nor could the second annotator see what the first had done ? If the specimen\nrecords shown are copies of the originals, we must presume he could, for\notherwise there would be no point in having tzvo annotation columns on\neach record. Now if the second annotator can see how the first has\nmarked, there will be a very strong bias for the second to accept the items,\nand the reading, rejected by the first. (That this bias was in fact acting is\nsuggested by the otherwise rather remarkable amount of agreement\nbetween the two subjects in the specimen records shown.) If therefore\nthe two annotators are cooperating in this way, we must not treat their\nchoice as two choices, for almost always it will in fact be one. Since\nHettinger does not give us the necessary information to enable us to\ndiscover when both of two subjects chose the same one of the two readings,\nthe only safe procedure is to assume that they always chose diflrerent ones,\ni.e. that the bias effect on the second annotator was complete. On this\nassumption we must halve the figures given by Hettinger for series 7, 8,\nand 9. It also looks as though the same correction must be applied to\nseries 6\u2014though it is difficult to be certain since the procedure is not\ndescribed very clearly. Certainly the correction must be applied to series\n5, where the method used was to invite the two subjects to cooperate with\none another and pick out their own items only after mutual consultation.\nThe correction does not very seriously reduce the total significance of the\nwhole investigation. The critical ratio for series 4-1 1 is reduced from\n6-1 to 5-6.*\n(c) Perhaps the most serious source of error arises from the presence\nat the sittings of someone who knew who the subjects were. It appears\nthat Hettinger was present at every sitting except a very few, and when\nhe was not, the articles were sent by post to the medium. Apparently\nHettinger was the only sitter and was his own note-taker. Such conditions\nare, of course, hopelessly lax. We cannot begin to judge how many times\nthe medium may have changed her mind about a statement in response\nto a change in Hettinger's facial expression, how many statements may\nhave escaped record, how many may have suffered modifications in being\nrecorded or in the transcription after the sitting when the rough notes\nof what the medium has said have to be converted into separate, short,\n* In applying the correction, figures for any one series which are not integers\nmust be rounded upwards. The presence of odd numbers in some of the figures\nfor series 5-9 is due to the disqualification of some of the readings for being\nreturned after the annotator was told which reading was his. The correction\nas applied makes the conservative assumption that one disqualified reading would\nhave been always paired with another.\n\f36 Christopher Scott [Part\nindependent statements. The possibilities are almost unlimited. It is j\nonly when the experimenter and note-taker do not know the subjects that I\nwe can safely assume these sources of error either to be absent or to cancel\nout.\nCan we assume, too, that the mediums never knew any of the subjects?\nWe have only Hettinger's bare assertion as evidence\u2014but was he in a posi-\ntion to know? Considering the length of the investigation such an\nassumption seems excessively risky ; it would be extremely difficult to\nmaintain effective secrecy over such a long period. We must remember,\ntoo, that the mediums were professionals : they must have known that\n(the reader will excuse my bluntness) they had secured an almost per-\nmanent source of employment. It would be most unwise to overlook the\npossibility of their gaining normal knowledge of the subjects.*\nThe complete absence of witnesses in Hettinger's experiments and his\nfailure (so far as we can judge) to take any precautions to prevent normal\nleakage are both highly unsatisfactory and make it impossible for students\nof Psychical Research unreservedly to accept his results.\n{d) Another point on which Hettinger is most unfortunately reticent is\nhis procedure when subjects gave non-commital replies to items. Other\ninvestigators have found that, even with the most explicit instructions,\nthere are always a few people who cannot be prevented from putting\nquestion-marks, qualifying their replies, or accepting one part of an item\nand not the other. The reader who has seen a mediumistic reading will\nfind this understandable : it is extraordinarily difficult to say \" yes \" or\n\" no \" to every item. Hettinger admits (p. 35) that he obtained such vague\nanswers, but his only mention of how he deals with them is a statement\n(p. 35), referring to series i, that in this series all such answers were dis-\nregarded. The wording of this statement, however, seems rather to sug-\ngest that this was not the practice in later series. Since it was presumably\nHettinger who decided what to do with a doubtful answer and since\nHettinger knew which were the original items and which the controls we\nhave here yet another serious opportunity for bias in the experimenter to\ninvalidate the results.\nV. Summary of the above criticisms.\nI find I have mentioned 33 separate possible sources of error in Hettin-\nger's work. Three of these are mutually incompatible, reducing the\nnumber of errors that may have been present to 3 1 . We can tell from the\ndata provided that 6 of these have definitely occurred, and when we\nmodify the statistical methods to allow for them and for 3 others whose\noccurrence is very probable we are left with a critical ratio for the 9 main\nseries of 5-3 (P\u2014 10 ^), which is still very highly significant. Of the\nremaining 22, 9 would apply to every series and 1 3 to only some of the series.\nWith so many possibilities there is little hope of making a very good\nguess at which error or errors are likely to have most seriously influenced\n* In this connection it is important to note that some of the subjects were\nunknown to Hettinger, and that articles could apparently be submitted voluntarily,\nwithout any request from Hettinger, by anyone who knew of the investigation.\nThe marked difference in success between the subjects, which is noted on p. 126,\nis perhaps relevant to this and to some of the other criticisms that have been raised.\n\f177] Experimental Object-Reading: A Critical Review 37\nthe results. My own opinion (though httle importance should be attached\nto it), based on the consistency of the positive results throughout the 9\nmain series, is that the most important sources of error were probably\nthose described above under (c) and {d), pp. 35, 36, that is, those arising\nfrom the fact that Hettinger, who knew who the subjects were, was present\nat the sittings and also was the final judge of whether a subject should be\nconsidered to have accepted an item in a doubtful case.*\nIt is very unfortunate that Hettinger would not allow me more than a\nbrief glance at his original material. If a thorough examination had been\npermitted, I have very little doubt that many of the possible errors I have\nmentioned, which Hettinger does not rule out by the description of the\nconditions he provides in his book, could have been shown not to have\nbeen in fact present, or at any rate, not to have seriously affected the\nresults.\nAs it is we can only conclude : that any of these errors might have been\npresent (though it is unlikely that they all were), that there is quite\ninsufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that any paranormal factor\nwas at work, and that Hettinger has failed, by a long way, to devise a fool-\nproof experimental technique for investigating object-reading\nPart II\nExploring the Ultra-Perceptive Faculty\nExploring the Ultra-Perceptive Faculty (1941) is a much more readable\nbook than The Ultra-Perceptive Faculty. It makes no serious attempt at\na scientific proof of the existence of the \" ultra-perceptive faculty \", but\nconfines itself to a presentation of a number of striking coincidences\nselected from an enormous mass of material. These coincidences are\nboth interesting and entertaining, but the possible role of chance is so\nhard to evaluate that only the most daring psychical researcher could\naccept them as serious evidence.\nI propose to explain the method, to discuss some of the most striking\ncoincidences and their possible relation to chance, to consider some of\nHettinger's comments, and then to pass on to some of Hettinger's later\nexperiments, where substantially the same technique is adapted to control\nexperiments in which the role of chance can be estimated exactly.\nThe basic idea of the method which Hettinger uses in Exploring the\nUltra-Perceptive Faculty has a great many merits and ingeniously avoids\nmanv of the difliculties encountered in the more usual type of experimen-\ntal investigation of object-reading. The possibility of normal deductions\nfrom the psychometrised object is completely ruled out, the danger of the\nsitter giving away information is very easy to eliminate, and the method\nadapts itself very conveniently to control experiments in which bias has no\nchance of vitiating the results. In addition, unlike many experirnents in\npsychical research, the procedure for the agent (for this method is a sort\nof compromise between object-reading and telepathy) is anything but\n* It is perhaps worth mentioning that none of the subsidiary conclusions at which\nHettinger arrives are incompatible with the hypothesis that the results have a\nsimple normal explanation. (See, for example, those on pp. 38-9, and pp. 183-5.\nNote that the former do not arise from control experiments.)\n\f3^ Christopher Scott [ParT:\ntedious, and very effectively ensures his normal attention to the material I\nmstead of\u2014as we so often get\u2014either his bored inattention or his exag--\ngerated concentration. In my opinion a proper control experiment based'\non this method is much the most satisfactoiy way of investigating object-\nreading mediums\u2014provided (and this, of course, is the real diificulty) a\nmedium who finds after one sitting that she has not had any great success\ndoes not object that she cannot, and cannot be expected to, exercise her\nfaculty in this way.\nHettinger describes his new method as follows.\n\" The Subject is asked to obtain any illustrated paper or magazine he\nfancies, but not to look at its contents until the prearranged time of the\ntest, when he shall start perusing it quite normally, without any effort of\nconcentration, marking on each page the exact time that page was read or\nthe pictures thereon were contemplated. Simultaneously therewith, the\nSensitive, miles away, and not informed of the actual nature of the experi-\nment, psychometrizes, viz. mentally concentrates on, an object belonging\nto the Subject and submitted to her in a sealed envelope by the experi-\nmenter ;\nthe latter writes down the items given by the Sensitive together\nwith the time when they were actually uttered by her.\"\nIn comparing the sensitive's impressions with the pictures contem-\nplated, a time-discrepancy of i minute in either direction is allowed. In\naddition an item given by the sensitive may be compared with any picture\nor article on the page being perused at the time, or on the page facing it.\nIt IS a serious fault in Hettinger's presentation of the experiments that he\nmakes no attempt to estimate how many pictures on the average each item\nmay be compared with. It is very hard to arrive at a fair estimate of this\nfigure. Four or five pictures per item would probably be a reasonable\nguess.*\nAt any rate, using this procedure Hettinger finds a number of resem-\nblances between the items given by the sensitive and the material being\nperused at roughly the same time. A large number of these resemblances,\nincluding 151 reproductions of drawings, photographs, etc., appear in the\nbook.\nAfter presenting nine of the best of these resemblances (under the\nheading : Cases of indisputably correct correspondence hetzveen the illustra-\ntions and the sensitive s perception) Hettinger \" submits that any one of the\nexamples above given is per se more convincing than a significant figure\nin any statistical calculation \". This is an ambitious claim. Let us con-\nsider what rational basis it has, and hence how reliable \"\nconvincingness\n\"\njs as a quality of evidence.\nThe total number of items given in the whole series of experiments was\n6,576. We have seen that, on the average, each item may be compared\nwith about 4 or 5 different pictures. The total number of comparisons\nthat were made was therefore in the region of 30,000. Let us consider\nthe best (No. 9). The picture is one of a very large horse with the caption\n\" Biggest horse in the world . . . still growing \". The only other things\nin the picture are the halter, the tassels made by plaiting the horse's mane\n* In the brief glance which Hettinger permitted me at his originals I saw one case\nof an Item which could be compared with 10 pictures and one case which could be\ncompared with only i.\n\f177] Experimental Object-Reading : A Critical Review 39\nand seen in silhouette, a man holding a rope from the halter and dressed in\na dark suit and a trilby, and a farmhouse faintly visible in the background.\n(This picture is remarkable, among those reproduced, for havmg almost\nno detail or other material than its main subject. Very often it is detail\nor one of the less prominent points on which the resemblances depend.)\nThe medium's comment was :\n\" Some admiration for large cart horses.\"\nThe question we have to ask is, would one such coincidence be expected\nto arise by chance {i.e. would its occurrence be at least as likely as not) in\n30,000 comparisons? Even if the reader feels he can answer this with a\ndefinite\n\" No \" we still know only that the result is positive. For it to be\non the borderline of significance we must be able to say that such a coinci-\ndence would not be expected to arise once in 600,000 comparisons, and\nfor it to be fairly strongly significant (say a chance probability figure of i in\n300) we should have to consider 10 million comparisons. I find it difficult\nto beUeve that anyone, however much he may dislike, disapprove of, or be\npuzzled by, statistics can, in the face of these figures, agree with Hettinger\nthat this single resemblance is more convincing than a significant figure\nin any statistical calculation. It is surely absurd to imagine that our\nintuition can be reliably used to inform us that such a coincidence would\nnot be expected to occur once in 600,000 comparisons.\nThe point, of course, about Hettinger's appeal to \"convincingness' \u2014\nor, what comes to the same thing, intuition\u2014is that many people's\nintuition can be safely relied upon to overlook the number of comparisons\nfrom which the resemblances shown have been selected. While no\nreasonable psychical researcher is likely to be taken in so easily, material\npresented in this way must completely mislead those who do not possess\nthe habit of critical consideration of evidence. Hettinger, to have been\nfair, should have emphasised repeatedly that the resemblances he produces\nas examples are selected from a total of some 30,000 comparisons.\nIn my view there are about three other resemblances which are almost as\nstriking as that quoted (Nos. 31, 62, 137). In these the actual connection\nis quite as good, if not better, but the pictures contain a good deal of other\ndetail and one could imagine a number of other possible items which\nwould have applied equally strikingly. The remaining resemblances range\nfrom the good, such as the appearance of the word \" dairy \" once in the\nitem and twice in the corresponding picture (No. i)*, to the very far-\nfetched, such as the item \" peculiar noise going on here \" given when the\nsubject was reading \" a short paragraph concerning 500,000 cats\n^\n(Hettinger's comment is,\n\" A rather intriguing case of ' ultra-acoustic\nperception.\").\nIt does not seem worth-while to discuss the various supplementary\nexperiments that Hettinger carried out using the same general method,\nsuch as\n\" association tests \", tests without articles, a \" relay \" experiment,\netc., since there is no serious evidence anywhere for the presence of\nparanormality.\n* In considering the extent of this coincidence, the question one must ask i_s\nnot, of course, \" How many items can be expected to contam the ivord dairy t\nbut'\n\" How many resemblances as good as this can be expected m so many compari-\nsons' \" There would clearly be far more of the latter than the former, so that\nto base an estimate on the former question\u2014as one is tempted to do at one s hrst\napproach\u2014would lead to a gross overestimate of the significance of the coincidence.\ni\n\f4\u00b0 Christopher Scott [Part\nBefore we leave the discussion of this work we ought perhaps to consi-\nder Hettinger's own attitude to it. Discussing the question of control\nexperiments, Hettinger writes :\n\" The question arises, however, whether an extensive statistical investi-\ngation of the magnitude of the writer's earlier experiments would add\nanything further to that which has already been attained, viz. proof of th<\nprobable existence of an ultra-perceptive faculty. Judging from a cursory\n'\ncontrol '\ncomparison between a few paired illustrated papers, as referred\nto above, in the writer's opinion the only further attainment that could be\nexpected from the application of the control method to '\nillustrated paper\n'\nexperiments would be a higher significant figure.*\n\" On the other hand, he feels that the very frequent occurrence of exact\ncorrespondence in substance and time during a one-hour test\u2014the accuracy\nof which correspondence is sometimes quite staggering, because of the\nvery specific character of the items perceived\u2014is per se, from a psycholo-\ngical point of view, far more convincing than statistics, which at the most\ncan only prove a probability. Indeed, the present experiments seem to\nhave a tendency that way, and, because thereof, the pictorial series method\nwhich has been conceived may, more especially in view of its constructive\npotentiality in further research work, be destined to supersede the statistical\nmethod, now that the latter has fulfilled its main function, viz. in\nestablishing the probability of the existence of an ultra-perceptive\nfaculty. . . .\n\" The writer was prompted to make these comments because the method\nwas conceived, inter alia, also with the object of providing a means of\ninvestigation which would carry conviction directly, instead of having to\nrely on lengthy statistics undertaken by others and on what the investi-\ngator and his critics may have to say about them respectively. Neverthe-\nless, seeing that chance coincidence is also an indisputable possibility,\nfor those who may desire to investigate the matter afresh from a statistical\npoint of view the writer highly recommends the '\npsychometric pictorial\nseries method '\nused in the present research. As already hinted, he believes\nthat the significant figure of probability will be found substantially higher\nthan those which he himself obtained in his statistical experiments, in\nwhich he had to rely on the memory of, and recognition by, the Subjects,\ninstead of on some definite means of identification.\"\nHettinger then goes on to oflFer a short control experiment of his own.\nA number of objections could be raised to this but need not, for Hettinger\nhimself comments :\n\" Since the comparison [of the pictures with the medium's statements]\nwas made by the writer himself, who knew which was the ' right '\nand which\nthe '\ncontrol '\npaper, he does not wish the above results to be looked upon\nas a statistical proof, in the sense of his earlier experiments. Anyone\nwishing to repeat the present tests with a view to providing further statis-\ntical proof, rather than exploring the subject for the purpose of ascertaining\nfurther facts, will have to use a separate adjudicator, as above explained.\"\n* Hettinger seems to have overlooked another possibility : that there might be\nno further attainment, and no confirmation of the earlier figure. To argue the pre-\nsence of paranormality in these experiments purely on the basis of the significant\nfigure obtained in the totally different earlier work is unreasonable.\n\f177] Experimental Object-Reading: A Critical Review 41\nThe above quotations make a fair sample of Hettinger's opinions of the\npurpose of the work. \" Statistical proof\" is not offered, partly because\nit has already been provided in the earlier book and partly because \" the\nvery frequent occurrence of exact correspondence in substance and time\nduring a one-hour test* ... is per se, from a psychological point of view,\nfar more convincing than statistics, which at the most can only prove a\nprobability \". The implication seems to be that, whereas statistics can\nonly prove a probability, intuitive estimation can provide certain proof.\nThis is an absurd claim. There are only two basic differences between\nintuitive and statistical methods of estimation : one, that intuitive methods\nare easier to apply ;\ntwo, that their results are much less objective\nand much less reliable. Intuitive methods are valuable for providing\npointers to what is going on and for suggesting possible new lines of\nexperiment, but they only have a place in a proof when the evidence is so\nclearly and indisputably significant (and by \" indisputably \" I mean,\nliterally, that no intelligent person can or does dispute it) that their inherent\ninaccuracy may safely be neglected. It is difficult to believe that anyone,\nhowever personally convincing he may find Hettinger's results to be,\ncould claim that their significance is indisputable in this sense.\nBut we need not labour the point. Their significance is disputed\u2014if\nonly by the present writer ; and where there is any disagreement we cannot\nafford to trust our intuition when perfectly sound objective methods are\navailable. As scientists, therefore, we are forced to set aside Hettinger's\nqualitative work with an agnostic shrug and pass to the study of objective\ncontrol experiments.!\nBefore we leave Exploring the Ultra-Perceptive Faculty, however, it\nwould perhaps give the reader who is not familiar with the work a better\nidea of the quality and type of material that appears in this and later\ninvestigations by Hettinger if we considered two or three examples taken\nat random from the resemblances reproduced in the book.\nWe have already seen one of the \" cases of indisputably correct corres-\npondence \". The next chapter after these is headed. Cases of obvious\ncorrespondence with some addition or slight distortion. The first example is\na picture of a boat (perhaps a small liner) over the side of which hangs a\nrope ladder. Standing on the bottom rung is a man in a diving suit\n(connected by a pipe to the deck) tentatively putting one foot in the water.\nTwo men, one in a diving suit, are looking down at him from the deck.\nThe background contains only clouds and sea. The caption is, \" How's\nthe water? \" The medium's statement is, \" Something to do with water.\nI cannot move for water ;\nsomething overflowed.\" Hettinger comments :\n\" The correspondence is exact, but the addition '\noverflowed '\ndoes not\napply. Maybe, the Sensitive vaguely perceived a man (the diver) moving\nin the waterj and the pipe, which she inferred was an overflow.\"\n* This seems to be a serious exaggeration. Hettinger makes no claim elsewhere\nthat exact correspondences are very frequent in one test.\nt I have confined myself to consideration of chance as an explanation of the results\nreported in this book. If the results had been really striking, other possible normal\nexplanations\u2014in particular, perhaps, the possibility of normal knowledge by the\nmedium of the material to be perused by the subject\u2014might have had to be\nexamined.\n+ The picture shows him with only the toes of one foot in the water.\u2014C. S.\n\f42 Christopher Scott [Part\nThe first picture in the next chapter, Cases of correspondence as regards\nsensations, feelings and emotions, is a drawing of a small dog with long ears !\nsitting down holding a handkerchief to his nose and crying. The caption i\nis, \" Hector says :\n'\nI don't think I ought to try to be funny today.' \" ;\nThe medium's impression is, \" Something I want to test in my hand ;\nusing pressure too.\" Hettinger comments :\n\" Notice the one paw of\n'\nHector '.\" (Hector is using one paw to hold the handkerchief to his nose.)\nPerhaps one further example will suffice from those headed, Cases\nwhich may seem ''far-fetched\". Hettinger's view of these cases is that, '\nalthough none of them is \" per se sufficiently convincing \", they are, com-\npared with the more striking resemblances, \" perhaps more important as\nregards the exploration of this baffling form of cognition, with a view to\ntracing its fundamental factors.\" The first example from this group is a\npicture of a naval officer wearing a large macintosh, standing with a pair\nof field glasses in his left hand and his right hand apparently in his pocket.\nThere are quite a number of other details. The medium's impression is,\n\" Someone has something the matter with the right hip ;\nputs hand on\nto be able to walk.\"\nIt will be seen that Hettinger's interpretation is always exceedingly\noptimistic. As in his earlier book, the possibility that any particular success\nmay be due to chance is not for a moment considered.\nI believe, nevertheless, that the average reader of Exploring the Ultra-\nPerceptive Faculty will get the impression that the examples reproduced\ncould not easily be accounted for by chance alone. There is no doubt\nthat the cumulative effect of so many examples is extremely convincing.\nBut whether this subjective experience of conviction is due to the actual\npresence of an extra-chance factor, or whether to the difficulty of bearing in\nmind the very great size of the selection factor, the large number of different\nthings contained in one picture, and the variety of meanings that might\nbe attached to most of the medium's impressions, is a question which can\nonly be answered when we have before us the results of a properly designed\nobjective control experiment. It is a thousand pities that Hettinger allowed\nhimself to spend such prodigious amounts of time and effort on purely\nqualitative experiments before such objective evidence became available.\nPart III\nThe Transatlantic Experiments of 1945-6 i\nHettinger's first serious, published attempt at applying a control method\nto his pictorial technique was carried out in conjunction with the American\nS.P.R. between February 1945 and July 1946, and is reported under the\ntitle. Psychometric Telepathy Across the Atlantic, in the Journal of the\nA.S.P.R. for July 1947 (Vol. XLI, No. 3).\nThe control methods are by no means satisfactory, and the work is\ndescribed by the Editor as no more than a pilot study, so that it should not\nbe necessary to make a thorough analysis.\nThe experiments consist of 16 one-hour tests using the \" pictorial ||\nmethod \" and the same sensitives as in all Hettinger's earlier work. Tests '\nI to 9 use one sensitive at a time, tests 10 to 16 use both simultaneously.\n\f177] Experimental Object-Reading : A Critical Review 43\nA complicated method of \" evaluation \" {i.e. of assigning different scores\nto different degrees of resemblance) is used which attempts to be objective,\nbut is clearly bound to contain some arbitrariness.\nNo justification is given for the use of the formula\ny ^ for the stan-\nS\ndard deviation of the fraction ^ from its expectation |, where is the\ntotal score on the originals and controls and S the score on the originals\nonly. Since the score on an item, instead of being fixed at unity, is\nmathematically capable of taking almost any value it is difficult to see any\nreason other than habit for Hettinger's use of this formula.* Hettinger\ncontinues the unjustifiable procedure (see above, p. 22) of taking for\/) and\nq their empirical values -^instead of their theoretical value |. (Note\no IfxMf\nalso that the formula for the score of an item or group of items 6c = \u2014^\n\u2014\ngiven on p. loi is upside-down. It should be, and is in fact used as,\nThe experiments were divided into two series. In series i (tests i to 10)\nthe procedure was the same as that used in the experiments reported in\n: Exploring the Ultra-Perceptive Faculty. A copy of a magazine was\nperused by the subject or agent (Mrs L. A. Dale, Research Associate of the\nA.S.P.R.) in New York during the hour of the test while a sensitive in\nLondon gave object-reading impressions on specimens of the subject's\nhandwriting. The contrormethod used was to compare the sensitive's\nimpressions not only with the magazine that was being perused when they\nwere given but also with another issue of the same magazine.\nHettinger's own assessment of the results of this series is highly signi-\nficant. We cannot take this as very serious evidence, however, since\nHettinger knew which were the originals and which the controls. As he\nsays himself (p. 97) :\n\" The main difficulty is assessment, in which the\npersonal element plays an important part. If, when a control method is\nused, the assessor knows which is the actual material and which is the\ncontrol material, the criticism may reasonably be advanced that he was\ninfluenced by a bias one way or the other. If an inexperienced assessor\nworks '\nblind ', and if the impressions of the sensitives are not absolutely\nconcrete hits, he begins to ponder and waver, finally deciding one way or\nthe other, and laying himself open to the criticism that his assessment was\nof an arbitrary character. If, as has been found to be the case, a large\nnumber of the impressions are not concrete hits, but rather distortions,\nassociations, inferences, allusions, relevant interpretations, etc., an assessor\nnot fully conversant with this specific kind of investigation simply ignores\nthem. ... I must confess that I myself, although I have spent hundreds\nof hours working with this kind of material, often have difficulty in deciding\nwhether or not to accept a given impression as an indisputable hit. . .\n.\"\nApparently dealing with this difficulty about a judge who knows the\n* For the correct formula for the standard deviation when \" evaluation \" is\nused, see p. 23, footnote.\n\f44 Christopher Scott [Part\noriginals from the controls Hettinger quotes some figures obtained on an\nassessment by Mr E. P. Gibson, of tests i, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10. He does\nnot say explicitly that Gibson did not know the originals from the controls,\nbut this is at any rate implied from the context. Other important details,\nhowever, are omitted. The subject in all these experiments notes on the\nmagazine the times when each page or picture is being perused. In\nGibson's control assessment we are not told whether dummy notes of\nsimilar times were put in the control magazines or, if so, exactly what steps\nwere taken to ensure that these were distributed with the same frequency\nas in the originals. Other criticisms could be brought against this assess-\nment, but need not, for Hettinger admits that it is unsatisfactory and incon-\nclusive. Moreover, the figure obtained by Hettinger's method of calcula-\ntion is only twice the standard deviation (corresponding to a chance of\nI in 20) which is only just significant.*\nA further assessment was made \" by a young student who was entirely\nunfamiliar with this sort of work \". She obtained nearly equal scores on\noriginals and controls.\nIt seems reasonable to conclude from these results (a) that there is no\nsubstantial evidence for the presence of a paranormal factor, and (b) the\nprocess of assessment is very far from objective.\nIn view of these inconclusive results a new control method was devised\nfor tests 11-16. This method was, if anything, even more unreliable than\nthat used in the first series, but it is of considerable importance because a\nslight modification of it provides much the most satisfactory method of\nexperimenting with Hettinger's pictorial technique. The method was to\nprepare two scrapbooks of 60 pictures each, randomly drawn from\nmagazines, one to be used as an original and one as a control. The\npictures in the original were contemplated for one minute each during the\nhour of the test. (The same scrapbooks were used for all six tests.) At\nthe end of the series of tests the two books were sent to Hettinger who\nwithout knowing which was which, compared the pictures in each book\nwith the items given by the sensitive at the corresponding times. He\nfound 362 items applicable to Book II and 264 to Book I. These figures\nhe treats in the usual way, to obtain a significant diflference in favour of\nBook II. This book was in fact the original.\nIt was not until after the experiments had been completed that it\noccurred to anyone that this experiment provides a chance of no more\nthan evens for the working of the \" Ultra-Perceptive Faculty \". Mrs Dale\nwrote to Hettinger as follows :\n\" The hypothesis is (or could be raised)\nthat you performed, so to speak, a single extrasefisory act, and by virtue of\nthis learned which was the correct scrapbook.t From then on, scoring of\n* This figure is unreliable for the reasons given above. Applying Student's t-test\nto the figures provided we get a quite insignificant probability, but it is clear that,\nwith so few figures and such a large variance, this is a case in which the ;-test gives\nvery conservative results.\nt The Editor, in a footnote to Hettinger's article, stresses that \" great pains\nwere taken to subject the two books to the same amount of wear and tear, etc., so\nthat there would be nor normal way of telling which one had actually been used in\nthe experiment \". Even if we could feel sure that this very difficult aim was achieved\nIt seems hardly necessary to postulate an \" extrasensory act \" to account for an\nevent which has a chance probability of just i in 2.\n\f177] Experimental Object-Reading : A Critical Reviezv 45\nindividual items could be coloured by this bedrock paranormal knowledge.\nIn other words, the sixty pictures scored are not actually independent\nitems and are therefore not properly evaluated by the CR (critical ratio)\nmethod. It is easy to be wise after the event, but I realise now that I\nshould have sent you the sixty pictures actually used, each paired with a\ncontrol picture\u2014rather than the series of pictures prepared in scrapbooks.\nThen there would be no question but what you would have had to make\nsixty independent judgments. We now suggest that you return the\npicture material, and that we ask Mr Gibson to re-evaluate the data when\nthe pictures are removed from the scrapbooks and presented to him in a\nseries of sixty paired items. Whether or not the actual stimulus picture is\nto be the first or the second of the pair can be determined by a suitable\nrandom method. The temporal order of the pictures from one to sixty\nwould of course be retained.\"\nHettinger, in his reply, wrote as follows : \"I have received your letter\nof the 13th inst., and I must confess that I was rather taken aback. I can\nsee your point of view, however, although I am afraid that whatever one\nmay do or say on the statistical side in connection with this kind of material,\none cannot escape both the difficult problem of assessment and some form\nor other of criticism, since evaluation concerns not only items of a concrete\ncharacter, but also subtle associations.\n\" The assessment of the last series was done picture by picture, and\nwithout any knowledge, perception, or guessing as to which of the two\nbooks had been used in the experiment. The high scoring was not due\nto any predilection on my part for one book rather than the other, but to\nthe accumulation of identical, similar, or obviously distorted associated\nitems (sensitive's impressions) in connection with one and the same\npicture. ...\"\nHowever, the proposed assessment was carried out by Gibson and a score\nof 98 was obtained on the originals and 126 on the controls.\nIt is quite clear from these results that we cannot safely draw any con-\nclusions as to whether or not a paranormal factor is at work. Hettinger's\nconclusion, \" that these tests as a whole provide substantial prima-facie\nevidence of transatlantic telepathy,\" is certainly far too optimistic.\nThe complete lack of agreement between Hettinger's and Gibson's\nassessments of series 2, strongly suggests that Hettinger was, in fact,\ninfluenced by bias in the way suggested by Mrs Dale.* But, whether or not\nthis was so, one thing stands out as self-evident : the process of assessment\nis so unreliable and subjective that it is quite unsafe to put the slightest\ntrust in it unless it is applied to an objective control method.\nThe greater part of Hettinger's article is taken up by reproductions of\nsome of the better resemblances. Sometimes the original pictures are\nboth reproduced and described, sometimes they are only described. It is\nclear from the former cases that Hettinger's descriptions are sometimes\nbiased in the direction of suggesting a greater similarity between the\npictures and the medium's impressions (see, for example, figures i and 2).\nNevertheless, there is no doubt that some of the resemblances reproduced\nare qualitatively very striking. Unfortunately, however, we are given no\nidea of the total number of comparisons from which these are drawn (a\n* With or without the \" single extrasensory act \".\n\f46 Christopher Scott [Part\nvery rough calculation puts the figure at about 10,000 ; but we are not\ngiven enough information to enable us to make any but the vaguest\nestimate). Nor are any of the resemblances obtained on control pictures\nreproduced. In view of the results of Gibson's assessment it seems very\nprobable that many such control resemblances would appear quite as\nstriking as the originals we are shown, and that, had they been reproduced,\ntheir cumulative effect would have completely destroyed any intuitive\nconviction the reader may have had that the original pictures bore a\nsignificant similarity to the medium's impressions.\nIn this case we can only conclude once more that Hettinger's method of\npresenting his material is utterly misleading. It is astonishing that, when\nthe control experiments show so clearly how narrow and elusive is\nthe margin between the successes on the originals and those on the\ncontrols, Hettinger can continue to consider it a fair method of presen-\ntation to reproduce a number of resemblances, selected from a total of\nunspecified size, and to overlook entirely the resemblances obtained on the\ncontrols.\nPart IV\nHettinger's Experiments with the Present Writer\nIn his report on the transatlantic experiments Hettinger stated that in\nview of the unsatisfactory nature of the statistical results he was contem-\nplating a further series of transatlantic experiments in which he hoped the\nstatistical \" difficulties \" might be overcome. The Editor also mentioned\nthat a third series was planned and pointed out that the first two series\ncould not be considered as more than a pilot study. Feeling that it would\nbe unreasonable to judge (and perhaps condemn) the first two series as a\nself-contained piece of work without waiting for the promised third series,\nI enquired of Hettinger in January 1948 when this series was to take place.\nHe replied that no further control tests were now contemplated.\nThe position at this stage was most unsatisfactory. Hettinger seemed\nto imply in his article that the work of assessment demands a skilled and\nexperienced judge. This is a fairly reasonable claim, but it leaves us\ncompletely in the air and quite unable to draw a definite conclusion from\nthe experimental evidence. The only objective control experiment we\nhad was assessed by an inexperienced judge (Mr Gibson) : the only\nexperienced judge we had (Dr Hettinger) had never assessed, and did not\ncontemplate assessing, an objective control experiment. Apparently we\nwere at an impasse.\nClearly, with the increasing attention that was being paid to Hettinger's\nwork (in Sept., 1947 he addressed the British Association for the Advance-\nment of Science, and in Sept.-Oct., 1947 the Daily Express ran a feature\non some experiments conducted by him), this situation was most unsatis-\nfactory. It was essential to be able to say definitely whether or not there\nwas any evidence for the paranormal in his results.\nWhen, therefore, Hettinger offered to give me two sittings, using the\nscrapbook method with me as subject, I resolved to take this opportunity\nof carrying out a control experiment with Hettinger as judge.\nIt was arranged that for each test I should make up a scrapbook of 60\n\f177] Experimental Object-Reading : A Critical Revieiv 47\npictures from magazines and look at the pictures, in order, for a minute\neach during the time of the test. After each test, Hettinger would send\nme a copy of the medium's* statements and I would make my own\nannotations and assessment. These I would return to Hettinger with the\nscrapbook, and he would make his assessment, finally returning every-\nthing to me.\nThe control procedure I decided upon was as follows :\nBefore each test a collection of 90 drawings was made from copies of\nLilliput.-\\ These were thoroughly shulfled, and 60 were randomly drawn\nand placed in the scrapbook, one between each leaf, without being stuck\nin position. These pictures were contemplated during the test. Because\nof the faint possibility of the medium's faculty working precognitively, the\nbook was left with these pictures in it for several hours after the test. A\nrandom selectionj of 30 of these 60 \" originals \" was then removed and the\n30 pictures left over from my original collection of 90 were substituted as\ncontrols. The 30 originals which had not been removed and the 30\ncontrols were then stuck in the book. In this way there could be no\nnormal means of deducing from the pictures or the book which were the\noriginals and which the controls. (No difference in \" wear and tear\n\"\ncould arise : each page of the book was turned over the same number of\ntimes, and the pictures were not handled during the test.\u00a7)\nSince I knew the originals from the controls there seemed little point\nin my making annotations. Mr A. M. Western, who did not have this\ninformation, very kindly undertook to make the annotations and assess-\nment instead, and it was his results that I forwarded to Hettinger. The\npossibility also occurred to me that if Hettinger's assessment gave negative\nresults, the criticism might be made that it was not the truly free,\nunbiased judgment of an experienced assessor, but was influenced by the\nresults of Western's assessment, which Hettinger would have before him\nwhile he made his own. I therefore asked Hettinger if he would make his\nassessment quite independently of Western's. This he agreed to do, and\nI sent Western's assessment in a separate envelope, which Hettinger did\nnot open until he had completed his own.\nIn making the assessment it was decided to divide the resemblances into\nthree classes : A, very striking ;\nB, good ;\nC, far-fetched but possibly\nsignificant. It was found that Western classed about seven-eighths of his\nresemblances C, one eighth B, and none A. Hettinger classed about one\nhalf C, one third B, and one sixth A, with the reservation that \" practically\nall those I marked C are in my opinion applicable and not far-fetched, but\n. . . not as good as those marked B \".\n* The medium for both these tests was Miss F. Fallows (\" F \").\nf Bearing in mind the limitations set by social convention on the medium's\nstatements, I thought it best to omit all pictures containing any appreciable sex-\ninterest.\nX In test I the determination of this selection was made some days before the\ntest ; in test 2, the day after. In both cases it was truly random and quite indepen-\ndent of the actual pictures.\n\u00a7 As this short experiment would have been, in any case, inadequate as a com-\npletely conclusive and formal proof of paranormality, I did not consider it necessary\nto have my procedure witnessed. The real purpose of the experiment was to test\nobjectively the reliability of Hettinger's judgment, so that no further precaution\nseemed necessary beyond those usually taken in experiments in psychology.\n\f48 Christopher Scott [Part\nBefore considering the results of the control experiment it is important\nto note that Hettinger, speaking of all the results before he knew about the\ncontrols, wrote : \"I consider them quite good and up to the standard of\nthe other results.\" (This was in reply to a comment of mine on the\nvagueness of the resemblances.) And again :\n\" Apparently you are a\nvery good subject so far as psychometry + telepathy is concerned. I am\njudging this by comparison with many other subjects who have partici-\npated in my experiments ; also by the character of the impressions\nreceived, which seem to cover a wide range.\"\nWe have, then, Hettinger's unequivocal statement that the results of\nthese tests, on the controls as well as the originals, are qualitatively quite\nas convincing as those obtained in others of Hettinger's experiments\n\u2014\nexperiments which Hettinger considers to provide \" substantial prima-\nfacie evidence \" and to be \" per se more convincing than a statistical figure\nin any calculation \".\nNow let us consider the objective results.\nThe following tables show thenumberof pictures eliciting at leastone hit.*\nI. Annotation by Hettinger\nTest I Test 2\nA B c Totals A B C Totals\nOriginals 3 4 II 18 4 4 5 13\nControls 3 7 8 18 I 8 5 14\nTotals 6 II 19 36 5 12 10 27\n2.

The only favourable figure is four A's on\nthe \" original \" pictures of Test No. 2 of Hettinger's annotation against\none on the controls. But this is almost balanced by a larger deviation the\nother way with the B's, and is in any case quite insignificant.\nI communicated these results to Hettinger and proposed a further assess-\nment of the 30 originals in each test which had not yet been used in the\nassessments, but he replied that he did not believe that any useful purpose\ncould be served by any further assessment or scoring.\n* The reason for working with the number of successful pictures rather than\nitems is that the former are known to be independent (or rather, strictly speaking,\nonly dependent in a random way) the latter may be interdependent, in the sense\nexplained above, p. 34. If we are to use the ordinary statistical formulae we must be\ncertain that the units from which the scores are built up arise from mutually\nindependent events.\n\f177] Experimental Object-Reading : A Critical Review 49\nIn a subsequent talk I had with Hettinger he gave an impression of\ncomplete confidence in the presence of paranormality in these tests. But\none reason, he suggested, why such experiments gave negative results\nmight be that the controls were not sufficiently different from the originals.\nWith such a wide range of resemblances as he permits, any two pictures\ndrawn at random will nearly always have some element in common ;\nindeed it is a very difficult task to find two pictures which have nothing\nat all in common. Instead of selecting the controls randomly, therefore,\nI should have carefully chosen each one so as to be as different as possible\nfrom the original it replaced.\nWhile I fully appreciate the soundness of this criticism I must point\nout that it leads directly to the conclusion that any given picture has so\nmany elements which are potentially capable of giving rise to mediumistic\nimpressions that chance resemblances between an impression and a picture\nmust inevitably be very frequent, and, in general, quite indistinguishable\nfrom genuine paranormal resemblances ; so that this criticism merely\ngives added weight to the argument that a mere enumeration of\nresemblances obtained without a control is a totally unreliable way of\nevaluating the results. That chance resemblances between pictures are\nso common means that chance resemblances between impressions and\npictures must be common. It follows that control methods are absolutely\nessential, and that even when controls are used and the greatest care is\ntaken to choose controls each as different as possible from the original it\nreplaces, any paranormal effect must be greatly diluted with chance\nresemblances.\nThe conclusion that must be drawn from these two tests is not that there\nis no paranormal factor at work in them or in any of Hettinger's work,\nbut that Hettinger has not yet devised a technique for adequately dem-\nonstrating the \" ultra-perceptive faculty \", and that his subjective judg-\nment as to whether coincidences are paranormal or not does not tally with\nthe results of objective tests. Since the conclusions to be drawn from the\nwork described in Hettinger's second book and his A.S.P.R. Journal\nreport depend almost exclusively on the reliability of his judgments in this\nrespect, we must conclude that very little weight can be attached to any\nof the evidence put forward in these reports.\nHettinger's ingenious and original \" pictorial method \" has many\nadvantages. In particular it seems that it might be peculiarly well suited\nfor what Hettinger calls \" exploring the ultra-perceptive faculty \", that is,\ndiscovering what sort of resemblances are most likely to arise paranormally.\nBut one thing is certain : nothing of value can come from it unless it is\ncombined with a technique for estimating the role that can be played by\nchance in bringing about resemblances. There can be no possible reason\nfor relying on subjective judgments where the simplest of checks is\navailable. Nor is it possible in this case to put forward the defence\n\u2014\nwhich may, perhaps, be valid on other occasions\u2014that control experi-\nments are misleading or unnecessary or insensitive, or that they mask\nimportant facts or disturb the psychic faculty or lead only to arguments\nabout statistics. All such arguments miss their mark because we are not\nproposing to modify the free uncontrolled experiments or to use a new\n\f5\u00b0 Christopher Scott [Part 177]\nmethod. All that is necessary in effect is to do a few additional experiments\nin which chance is known to be the only operative factor. Control experi-\nments in Hettinger's work would not involve a change of method, but\nmerely an addition to the existing method. What objection can there be\nto this addition? Nothing could be simpler to carry out ; the statistical\nassessment is the most straightforward there can be ; and there is no\nconceivable possibility of information being lost by getting the judge to\nassess a number of extra pictures. In no other science would an experi-\nmenter insist on relying on his subjective judgment when a perfect objec-\ntive check is available.\nIt is a great misfortune to psychical research that the work of such an\nenergetic investigator should have been deflected from the path of scien-\ntific method into a field where guessing is the only form of judgment, and\nmeasurement is replaced by the bare presentation of unrepresentative\nsamples of the data.\nEditorial Note\n[Complete candour between psychical researchers engaged in the same\ninvestigation is of tlie utmost importance and has been a cherished tradition\nof the Society. There are some kittds of experiments, intended to check\nprevious work, which are in other respects desirable, but are difficult to carry\nout with strict adherence to this principle. In designing the interesting\nexperiment described in the foregoing paper Mr Scott appears to have found\nthis difficulty unsurmountable.\nAll psychical researchers should bear the principle in mind, and take all\npossible care, when planning their experiments, to avoid any infringement of it.\nAfter completion of the experiment Mr Scott offered to show his paper to\nDr Hettiiiger, who raised no objection to its publication.^\n\fREVIEW\nMatter, Mind and Meaning. By W. Whately Carington. With a preface\nby Professor H. H. Price. Methuen, 1949. Pp. xx, 257. I2S. 6d.\nMr Whately Carington died on 2nd March, 1947, a great loss to psychical\nresearch and to our Society, of which he had been an active member for\nsome thirty years. Up to the last few months of his life, when he became\nincapacitated through illness, he was engaged in writing a book on philo-\nsophy, entitled Matter, Mind and Meaning, to which he attached great\nimportance. At the time when he ceased to be able to do further work on it\nhe had completed about two-thirds of it. After his death the manuscript\npassed into the hands of Professor H. H. Price, who has prepared it for the\npress and contributed an appreciative and most interesting preface and\noccasional footnotes.\nProfessor Price says that the first five chapters were almost complete in\ntheir final form. The main body of the book now ends with the sixth\nchapter, entitled Mind and Matter. Of this there existed only two very\nbrief alternative versions, which Professor Price has tried to conflate. The\neditor has added, from papers left by the author, three appendices. One\nis a more popular form of the argument in Chapter II on the failure of\nmetaphysics. The other two contain what are probably Carington's\nlatest thoughts on the notion of life after death and on the nature of\nprecognition.\nWhately Carington's final philosophical position is a form of neutral\nmonism. Minds and matter are complexes composed of constituents of\nthe same kind, viz., sensa (extra-somatic and intra-somatic) and images,\narranged in characteristically different constellations. He calls these\nconstituents \" cognita \" or \" cognizables \". His explicit reason for holdhig\nthis view is that he thinks that it is necessitated by the theory of meaning\nwhich seems to him to be the only one acceptable. This is the doctrine\nthat every intelligible sentence which is not tautological must be in prin-\nciple verifiable or refutable by sensation or introspection.\nNeither of these views is original, and Whately Carington fully acknow-\nledges his debt to Earl Russell for the theory of neutral monism, and to\nMessrs Ogden and Richards and Professor Ayer for the theory of meaning\nand the contention, based upon it, that metaphysical sentences are meaning-\nless.\n\" Metaphysics \" is described as an attempt to infer true and intelli-\ngible propositions about the actual world from a priori premises. Actually\nI think that few distinguished metaphysicians have attempted to argue\nfrom premises which are all of them a priori. The description might\nperhaps fit Spinoza ; it certainly does not fit Leibniz, or Kant, or McTag-\ngart, or Alexander, or Whitehead.\nI do not consider that the book is of any great interest or importance as a\ncontribution to philosophy. The main value which can be ascribed to it\nfrom that point of view is as a lively popular introduction to the weightier\nand more technical works of Ogden and Richards, of Professor Ayer, and\nof Earl Russell on the topics which it treats. I found Professor Price's\n51\n\f52 Review [Part 177]\nintroduction, which contains a number of bold and fruitful suggestions,\nconsiderably more interesting than the book itself.\nWhat gives to Whately Carington's posthumous work such interest and\nimportance as it possesses is the fact that he had an expert firsthand\nacquaintance with the established results of psychical research, that he\nfully realised that they constitute a challenge to philosophers, and that he\nhad himself already made a bold and original speculation as to the modus\noperandi of telepathy. Now Earl Russell and Professor Ayer (in common\nwith the vast majority of western philosophers) have never shown the least\ninterest in, or acquaintance with, the results of psychical research ; and they\nhave never shown any sign of realising that philosophy ought to take account\nof them and try to fit them into its picture of the world along with the facts\nof normal sense-perception and normal interaction of mind and matter.\nWhately Carington tries to show that the occurrence of telepathy and\nclairvoyance is by no means paradoxical on the neutral monist theory of\nmind and matter ; and he maintains that their existence presents extreme\ndifficulties to other theories. It is to be presumed that he intended to try\nto show that well attested paranormal physical phenomena, both sporadic\nand experimental, fit easily into the neutral monist world-picture. This,\nas Professor Price points out, he did not live to accomplish. Price himself\nmakes two very interesting alternative suggestions on this topic in his\nprefatory essay. One is an extension of the notion of ideo-motor action.\nThe other is an extension of the notion of telepathically produced hallu-\ncination.\nThe book contains a large number of misprints, though none of them\nis serious enough to obscure the obvious meaning. I have noted no less\nthan eight, and there may well be others which I have overlooked.\nC. D. Broad\n\fPROCEEDINGS OF THE\nSOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nPART 178\nOBITUARY\nMiss Isabel Newton\nMiss Newton's services to the Society and to psychical research were\nexceptionally long and in many ways remarkable. They began in 1903\nwhen, being on the lookout for a secretarial post, and having no previous\ninterest in psychical research, she was moved to apply for a vacancy on\nthe staff of the S.P.R. A fortunate day, that, for the Society!\nAlice Johnson had a few months previously been appointed Organizing\nSecretary, and Miss Newton was at first her assistant, becoming Secretary\nin 1908. This post she held until her retirement in 1938, when the\nCouncil signalized their appreciation of her services by placing her name\non the very short list of Honorary Members.\nFrom 1916, when Alice Johnson retired from the position of Research\nOfficer, until 1938 Miss Newton was the mainspring of the Society's office\norganization and gained the confidence and affection of all the members\nwith whom she came into contact. She also gained a practical knowledge\nof psychical research that few of her contemporaries could rival.\nAfter a year of vtell-deserved leisure, on the outbreak of War in 1939,\nMiss Newton at once offered to assist the Council in carrying on the\nSociety's work. This offer was gratefully accepted. Very wide emergency\npowers were delegated to her and to myself as Hon. Secretary. She was\nunremitting in her attention to her new duties, and it was largely through\nher devotion to the Society's work at this time and the confidence of our\nmembers in her, that the heavy decline in numbers which took place in the\nearly years of the War was arrested, and that by 1942 a slight, at first a very\nslight, increase was observable. When she retired from the Council in\n1944 she consented, notwithstanding indifferent health, to continue to\nserve on the House Committee.\nHer career was an outstanding example of the triumph of mind and\ncharacter over the serious initial disadvantage of an education which did\nnot include any time at college or any specialized training whatever. But\nsympathy, personal loyalty, freedom from all trace of egotism and ability\nto learn from others, were part of her innate endowment.\nHow much she learnt from close association with Alice Johnson may be\nseen from her tribute to the latter in Proceedings, vol. xlvi, pp. 19-22.\nSuperficially the two were very different. Alice Johnson was small in\nbuild, austere in appearance and reserved in manner : Miss Newton in all\n\f54 Ohiluarx : Miss Isabel Nnvlon [Part\nrespects the opposite. But there were many underlying points of similar-\nity, and many of the things Miss Newton writes of Alice Johnson might\nwell be applied to herself, as when she mentions \" the consideration she\nshowed for everyone with whom she was in contact, directly or in-\ndirectly \". Again, \" I remember her impressing upon me that, in replying\nto correspondents, it was our duty to help them to understand, and telling\nme that she found it helpful to assume, for that purpose, that they were\nignorant and rather stupid. . . . Her devotion to the interests of the\nSociety impressed me greatly. She had a great capacity for sympathy,\nand a gift for expressing it in letters simply and sincerely.\"\nI have spoken of Miss Newton learning from Alice Johnson, but in\nthese matters she needed little teaching. All she needed, and that she got,\nwas an example to encourage the development of her own natural tenden-\ncies. She did not possess that strong grasp of complicated detail, or that\nability for marshalling it into ordered hypotheses, that was characteristic\nof Alice Johnson. During her term of office various specialized forms of\npsychical research successively engaged a large part of the Society's\nactivities. First came the investigation of \" the S.P.R. group of auto-\nmatists \". Then, after the First War, came the heyday of physical\nphenomena, and of recent years the great extension of quantitative\nresearch. All these required technical knowledge which, with her other\nduties, she could not have been expected to acquire. She contented\nherself with a good general knowledge of the work being done.\nBut it would be a mistake to allow her long and admirable record in\nadministration to obscure the amount of research which fell to her lot\nin the course of her work as Secretary, or the ability with which she\nhandled it, or, again, the extent of the knowledge she gained thereby. If a\npracticable arrangement could be made whereby some person, chosen by\nlot from among our members. Council members included, undertook for\na week to answer all the letters received in our office, and to take all the\ninterviews, the fundamental problems of psychical research would be much\nmore widely and thoroughly understood than they are. Whoever does\nwork of that kind has under his observation a garden plot, as it were, in\nwhich the sprouting of every kind of psychic phenomenon, real and\nspurious, may be watched. Miss Newton cultivated this plot for a life-\ntime, and in so doing developed an uncanny flair for distinguishing weeds\nfrom flowers as soon as the first green shoots appeared.\nTo do the work as well as she did it required reserves of sympathy,\npatience, tolerance and tact that were inexhaustible. I have seen her\nemerge from an interview that would have prostrated most persons, and\nturn quietly to the next piece of work, simply remarking that there were\nsome very queer people about. Calmness did not, I think, come easily to\nher. During her last illness she told me that in early days she often found\nherself getting vexed, and had to remind herself that Isabel Newton was\none person, and the Secretary of the S.P.R. another. Doubtless the\nexample of imperturbability set by Mrs Sidgwick helped her here.\nAnd her keen sense of humour must also often have come to her\nassistance. She was not particularly witty, but had a very sharp apprecia-\ntion of the many oddities of mind and temperament with which her daily\nduties made her familiar. This was apparent on even a short acquaintance,\n\f178] Obilttary : Miss Isabel Xezvlon 55\nbut it was only after I had known her well for several years that I was\nfavoured with an exhibition of her remarkable talent for mimicry. This,\nit should be added, was never unkindly in intention.\nAs the result of her long and varied experience, she came to form\ndefinite opinions, but she never obtruded these in her letters or interviews.\nAny enquirer could be sure of getting from her a well-informed, im-\npersonal, objective statement as to the points at issue in any debateable\nmatter, with good guidance as to the literature most likely to be helpful\nto him in forming his own conclusions. It was typical of her independence\nof mind that, although her admiration for Mrs Sidgwick and Alice\nJohnson was almost unbounded, she continued to hold her own much\nmore sceptical views on the question of survival. She was candid but\nunobtrusive in stating her own opinions, and it was not until I had worked\nclosely with her for many years that I discovered how deep-seated her\nscepticism was.\nNor was it merely in opinion that she was independent. No one could\nhave accused her of the autocratic temper sometimes attributed to her\npredecessor, but she could act forcefully on her own initiative when she\nthought the Society's interests were at stake. On one occasion, when there\nhappened to be already a good deal of friction in the Society, she had\nreason to believe that a senior and much respected member was intending\nto include in a public address a passage that would have been taken as a\npersonal attack on other members, several of whom would probably have\nresigned. She asked to see the manuscript of the speech, sought an\ninterview with the speaker, and after some argument procured the can-\ncellation of the passage. Later she thought it proper that as Hon. Secretary\nI should know of her action, but very few of our members ever knew how\nher discretion and tact had averted a crisis.\nIt was through her initiative that the Society acquired its premises in\nTavistock Square. When the lease of its former rooms in Hanover Square\nexpired, the Council were for some time at a loss where to go. Various\nquarters were offered them, each more inconvenient than the last. But\nMiss Newton was not discouraged. She gave herself no rest till she had\nfound what seemed needed, and on the basis of the careful estimate she\nprepared, she persuaded the Council that it would be more economical\nas well as in every way more convenient for the Society to have a house of\nIts own rather than to be a tenant of rooms in someone else's house.\nAgain, in the matter of exemption from income tax she refused to accept as\nfinal the adverse opinions that the Council had more than once received.\nShe w^as sure that these were due to an inadequate presentation of the\nfacts, set about to get the matter put on a more satisfactory basis, worked\nup the evidence that she found would be necessary, and eventually had\nthe satisfaction of seeing the Society granted an exemption without which\nIts financial position would have been desperate in recent years. It was\ncharacteristic of her that she more than once after her retirement protested\nthat the very modest pension she w^as receiving after a life-time of service\nwas more than the Society could afford.\nDuring the last year of her life she suffered a great deal of pain, and her\nserious operation last summer gave her only temporary relief. To within\na day or two of her death there was nothing she enjoyed more than a talk\n\f56 Obitiiai v : R'[iss Isabel Newton [Part\nabout the S.P.R., whether it turned on the great figures of the past with\nwhom she had worked, or on more recent developments, which she\nfollowed with equal keenness. The pleasure of such a talk was certainly\nnot one-sided. The staff of the Nursing Home adored her, and said they\nhad never had so good a patient.\nIt is forty-seven years since Miss Newton was appointed Assistant\nSecretary. Those years saw great changes in the personnel actively\nengaged in S.P.R. work, in the subject matters and methods of research,\nand in the Society's fortunes. To some of us who were closely associated\nwith her in the later period of her work, her loyalty and friendliness\nthrough all our difficulties seemed among the most trustworthy guarantees\nof future progress.\nI am glad to be able to print below personal impressions from several\nof her old friends and former colleagues.\nW. H. S.\nAmerican members of the S.P.R. visiting London had reason to be\ngrateful to Miss Newton. With her manifold duties she was never too\nbusy to examine records that were referred to her and to weigh the\nevidence with strict adherence to the methods and standards of Mr\nPiddington's High-and-Dry School. This increased the inquirer's\nconfidence and respect for psychical research, regardless of disappointment\nwhen things were sometimes not what they had seemed to be.\nMiss Newton's generous nature went much farther than this. She\nsaw to it that American visitors met members of the S.P.R. who had\ntaken an active and valuable part in the Society's work. Thus it was my\ngood fortune to become acquainted with leaders in the field who still lived\nin the late 1920's and 30's.\nMiss Newton's loyalty and devotion to the S.P.R. need no comment\nfrom me. But I should like to mention one instance of her innate modesty.\nWe happened to have a dinner engagement on the day when the Special\nCommissioners upheld the Society's claim for exemption from income tax.\nWhen Miss Newton arrived she was radiantly happy, and she told me in\ndetail about the hearing of the case. Not a word was said of her own part\nin what had led to the momentous decision, only how much the others had\ndone. It was not until some months later when I read Mr Salter's report\nof the outcome in the S.P.R. Journal that I learned this important success\nwas very largely due to Miss Newton's enterprise and tact.\nOver the years we became great friends. Psychical research was not\nour only common interest. And it was then that I frequently teased Miss\nNewton about having missed her real vocation. She was a delightful\nmimic and was able to impersonate mutual friends and acquaintances to\nthe life, throw their foibles into sharp relief, and always with such warm\ngood humor that my invariable reaction was an increased liking for or\ninterest in the \" victim \".\nMiss Newton faced her personal difficulties in the last years with the\nfine courage that was implicit in her character. A message last Christmas\nsaid, \" About the same,\" when I knew that she was on a much lower\nlevel. It was cheering to be informed that loyal S.P.R. members were\n\f178] Obituarx Miss Isabel Newton 57\nproviding Miss Newton with personal attention and physical comfort she\nmight not otherwise have had in her long illness. It was a token of the\naffection and high regard in which she was held by her many friends in\npsychical research.\nLydia W. Allison\n{Secretary, American S.P.R.)\nIt was very many years ago that I first met Miss Newton, in the long-ago\ndays when the Society's rooms were in Hanover Square. I had gone there\nto recount some telepathic experience, and to enquire into the work of the\nSociety. The immediate impression which she then made on me, of a\nhappy mixture of intelligence and kindness, was confirmed and deepened\nas the years went on. Her open but critical mind, her sympathetic insight,\nand her great respect for truth made association with her a most happy\nand valuable experience. I only now reahze how much I learnt from her.\nShe was always good company, for she saw life both dramatically and\nhumorously, and brought zest both to leisure and work. Books, the\ntheatre, travel, talk, all experiences were savoured to the full. Highly\nintuitive herself, she could give sympathetic understanding to those who\nexperienced paranormal phenomena, she had instinctive insight into the\nworkings of the unconscious mind, and early prophesied the help which\nwould come from its scientific study.\nShe was a tirelessly interested and sympathetic observer of life in its\nendless aspects. Few things made her iinpatient, except perhaps, a defeatist\nattitude. For her, a problem or a difficulty was always a challenge, and\nthis is how I see her, I think, most clearly, and shall most clearly remember\nher, responding with generous energy and with colours flying, not con-\nscious of how much she spent herself, till the difficulty was resolved, or\nthe friend rescued. Her help was so wholehearted that often the difficulty\nseemed miraculously solved, to her own great astonishment.\nHer own generosity enabled her to express gratitude generously\n;\nduring her last illness her faith in life even grew in strength, and her\nunselfish courage remained undimmed to the end, endearing her to all\nwho knew her.\nIna Jephson\nI did not have many opportunities for meeting Miss Newton personally,\nnor did we have much correspondence. None the less she made a con-\nsiderable impression, in various ways. Her appearance, for one thing :\nshe had such beautiful eyes, hair, and skin, and good features too ; I often\nthought she must have been lovely as a girl, and was astonished when,\nlatterly, she told me her age. There was also her ability to remain calm\nand unruffled in controversy, and never to seem hurried at work. And I\nfound her full of that rare gift, common sense. Critical of people, though\nnever maliciously so, while she assessed character accurately she was\nalways loyal, and I never heard her say anything better left unsaid. She\nwas also a wonderful mimic, and I gathered had a suppressed desire to\n\f58 Obitiiarv : l\\Iiss Isabel Neivton [Part\nwrite stories. Our chief bond was our mutual admiration and affection\nfor Mrs Sidgwick : I think we talked more of her than of anyone else in\nour brief encounters.\nNea Walker\nI first got to know Isabel Newton when I began to work for the Society\nin 1908, and she had recently become its Secretary. My personal contact\nin these early days was mainly with Alice Johnson, whose Assistant I was,\nbut I soon became aware of Miss Newton as some one upon whom one\ncould always depend for help and information, and after Miss Johnson's\nresignation we worked much together, and came to know each other well.\nTwo words which come immediately to my mind when I think of her are\nsympathy and loyalty. Her sympathy was the result of a genuine and\nquite unforced interest in other people's problems, and a practical desire\nto help them in any way she could.\nI was her colleague all through the years of the first War, when we\nreceived almost daily visits from people (by no means all of them Members\nof the Society) who had suffered recent bereavements. To some of these\nvisitors their bereavement had come as a shattering blow, and they were\nfinding it difficult to look forward into the future and face life. Miss\nNewton's skill and patience in setting them on the road again were quite\nexceptional. She was scrupulously honest, she offered them no easy\nanodynes, but she instilled into them something of her own courage and\nbuoyancy, persuading them to \" try again \".\nHer loyalty to the Society in general and to her colleagues in particular\nstood like a rock ; I never at any time felt that there was the remotest\npossibility that she would let me down. One incident I remember\nwhich was characteristic of her : the Office staff at that time consisted of\nMiss Newton, Mrs Thatcher (Assistant Secretary), and myself. Miss\nNewton had been out of health for some time and had at last gone away\nfor a much needed holiday, when I arrived at the Office one morning to\nget news that Mrs Thatcher's husband had been killed at the front and\nshe would not be coming to work. I wrote at once to inform Miss Newton\n(I knew she would not wish to be left in ignorance of what had happened),\nbut I assured her I could carry on single-handed for a time, and she was\non no account to curtail her holiday. She came back next day.\nI shall always remember with pleasure the friendly talk I had with her\nin the Nursing Home only four days before she died. It was evident to\nme that the end could not be far off, and Miss Newton told me frankly\nthat she would be glad when it came. But her mind was perfectly clear,\nand she was serene, and contented, as she said, to look back upon a long,\nfull and happy life. She told me it was a pleasure to her to realize from the\nmany letters she had had how much help she had been able to give to\nothers by merely \" being herself \".\nMiss Nea Walker has referred to her physical appearance, and as I\nlooked at her face on that last visit, \u2014the flesh fallen away, so that one saw\nthe shape of the bone,\u2014I thought how beautiful she was.\nH. DE G. S.\n\f178] Obituary : Miss Isabel Newton 59\nWhen in 1935 I took office as Research Student of the Society (becoming\nResearch Officer the following year), I knew very little about psychical\nresearch. I had assisted, mainly on the scientific side, with some experi-\nments with a physical medium ; I had done a certain amount of somewhat\nunsystematic reading of psychology\u2014mostly of what was then called\n\" the New Psychology \" ; and I had examined some of the more recent\nliterature of psychical research. I was thus deeply dependent upon Miss\nNewton, who was then Secretary, both as a general psychical counsellor,\nand as a director of studies. She was able to tell me exactly what I should\nread, and\u2014more important\u2014which of it I should read first. She was\nalso ready to set me right on the many and varied day-to-day points which\nmy work threw up ; and she gave me useful hints about the various\nmembers of the Society, and others, with whom my work brought me into\ncontact. Her advice was invariably sound. She was, of course, a very\nclever woman, not so much brilliant as soundly clever, and her intellect, I\nthought, was more like that of a man\u2014and a gifted man\u2014than a woman's.\nFor example, she ne\\ er made up her mind without careful consideration\nof all the available evidence ;\nand, once her mind was made up, she\nrarely changed it.\nShe was of immense assistance to me, both on account of her wisdom\nand experience, and from her kindness and enthusiastic encouragement.\nHer knowledge of the literature made her invaluable to a beginner in the\nsubject. Without her advice, I should not have found until months or\nyears afterwards many papers which were of the greatest \\alue to my\nwork, and I should have wasted time in ploughing through much that,\nthough highly praised by some, was really of smaller importance. She\nknew all the tricks of the trade, and could point an unerring finger at the\none weak spot in what appeared to be a cast iron \" case \". At first, I\ndisagreed with some of her judgments of individuals : people whom I\nthought were sound she gravely discounted, and vice versa. But I soon\ndiscovered that she was almost invariably right. \" Tell me your longi-\ntude,\" said Sir Lulworth Quayne in \" Saki's \" story The Blind Spot, \" and\nI'll know what latitude to allow you.\" Miss Newton could tell everyone's\nlongitude to within a second of arc, and she knew exactly what latitude to\nallow them. While full of kind encouragement, she made no attempt to\ndisguise the extreme difficulty of the subject, and the immense value of\nthe work which had already been done, much of it, of course, by persons\nof the very highest intelligence. Soon after my arrival she propounded a\nprinciple which (though of course it was most tactfully and charmingly\ndisguised) really amounted to this :\n\" If ever you have a brilliant new\nidea, you are almost certain to find out that it has already all been said,\nmuch better, by Mrs Sidgwick.\" I used this principle as a sort of psychical\nWilliam of Occam's Razor\u2014and I found it most salutary.\nShe appeared to be an untidy worker. Her desk was always stuffed and\nlittered with countless papers, arranged apparently in a truly random\nsequence\u2014but she was always able to lay her hands instantly on the\ndocument that she wanted. She was also fond of making notes on odd\nlittle scraps of paper. But in reality she worked quickly and systematically.\nWe never discussed general subjects. With so much to talk about in\nrelation to our work, we had no time for that. I never discovered whether\n\f6o Obituary : Miss Isabel Neivfon [Part 178]\nshe was artistic or fond of music ; whether she went to the theatre ; or\nwhat sort of books she read. On the one occasion that I visited her\ncharming httle flat, we talked mostly of the business on hand (I had been\nasked to come for the purpose of photographing the relative positions of\ntwo objects which were thought to have been referred to in a sitting of\nthe \" book-test \" type). But after the beginning of the war (by which\ntime she had retired from the post of Secretary) she spoke to me and\nmade a suggestion, which seemed to me a very sound one, in connexion\nwith the broadcast messages which were then being given to the people of\nEngland with the object of maintaining morale. I was able to pass on her\nsuggestion to the appropriate quarter, and it was acted upon\u2014and with\nsplendid effect. Whether this was due solely to Miss Newton's idea, or\nwhether the suggestion had been made previously by others, I do not know.\nC. V. C. Herbert\n\fTHE EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FOR PK\n.\n- AND PRECOGNITION\nBy C. W. K. Mundle\nThe purpose of this paper is to ask whether, and if so how, we can\ndistinguish experimentally between cases of PK and cases of precognition.\nBefore tackling the problems which face the experimenter, it seems\nproper, however, to decide how we shall interpret the words \" PK \" and\n\" precognition \". There may turn out to be substantial disagreement\nregarding the definition of these words : for one thing, it is difficult to\ndefine these words at all, without implying or suggesting some particular\nmetaphysical theory. I shall, however, for the purpose of this discussion,\nprovisionally accept the theory of psycho-physical dualism, in that I shall\nassume that mental events and physical events are of irreducibly different\nkinds ; but I wish to leave it an open question whether, or in what sense,\na mind or a piece of matter may be called \" a substance \". If some\nreaders disagree with my definitions of \" PK \" and \" precognition \", I\nhope, at least, that my definitions will make it clear in what respects I am\ndeparting from their usage.\nWhen I speak of \" precognition \" in this paper, I shall be referring\nonly to what Professor Broad has more accurately described as \" super-\nnormal non-inferential precognition \".^ I suggest that we should define\n\" a precognition \" as a human event, which stands in certain relations\nto a later event (which may be of any kind whatsoever), the relations in\nquestion being (a) that the later event exerts direct causal influence on\nthis human event or on one of the antecedent conditions of this human\nevent : (b) that the later event corresponds epistemologically to this\nhuman event, that is to say, the later event resembles the human event in\nways which make us say that it verifies the human event.\nThis definition calls for some explanations :\n(i) I speak of a human event because I wish to include both mental\nevents, like having an image, seeing an apparition, or entertaining a\nproposition, and also pieces of bodily behaviour like writing or uttering\na word or sentence, or drawing a picture. In some cases of ostensible\nprecognition, we are not entitled to describe the earlier event as mental.\nFor example, in automatic writing, all that can be observed in many cases\nis the writing movement and what is written, for automatists are often\nunable, later, to remember writing a given sentence or entertaining the\nproposition thus recorded. If we say that the automatist must, in some\nsense, have been simultaneously conscious of what she wrote, this is a\nconclusion reached by problematic inference, and not an observed datum.\n(ii) I speak of the later event exercising direct causal influence on the\nhuman event or on one of the antecedent conditions of this human event.\nI introduce this alternative because many psychical researchers considei\nthat, in cases of supernormal cognition, the object of the percipient's\n* \" The Philosophical Implications of Foreknowledge \", The Aristotelian\nSociety, Supplementary Volume XVI.\n6i\n\f62 C. IF. K. Dlundlc [Part\nconscious experience is usually a more or less distorted product of\nprocesses occurring in the unconscious mind of the percipient. If this is\nso, the later verifying event would presumably exert direct causal influence\non unconscious mental events which arc causal ancestors of the observed\nevent which we call \" a precognition \". The immediate causal ancestors\nof the latter event may, however, include physical events in the per-\ncipient's brain, in which case it might be these cerebral events which\nwere directly influenced by the verifying event.\n(iii) My above definition may appear to some people to leave out part\nof what they mean by \" precognition \" (or by \" foreknowledge \" if they\nuse that term), namely the element of knowing (or truly believing) a fact\nabout the future. I suggest, however, that, in so far as the words \" pre-\ncognition \" and \" foreknowledge \" suggest this element as part of their\nmeaning, they are misleading for describing the facts in question. For,\nin most of the spontaneous cases, the earlier human event is interpreted\nas precognitive, only after the observation of a later event which verifies\nit.i And in the experimental situation, the percipient appears incapable\nof distinguishing which of his guesses are \" hits \".\" Perhaps I should\nmention here that when I speak, later in this paper, of a person being\ninformed by precognition of a later event, I do this to avoid circumlocution,\nand intend to say not that this person has ever thought of the occurrence\nof the future event, but merely to say that the future event has directly\ninfluenced prior events in his mind or brain, in such a way as to increase\nthe probability of his behaving in ways which are appropriate to the\noccurrence of this future event.\nOur definition of \" PK \" will, I imagine, be less controversial. It\nseems that Professor Rhine, and other psychical researchers, use \" PK \"\nprimarily to refer to the following property\u2014direct causal influence of a\nmental event on a physical event which occurs outside the physical\norganism associated with that mental event. It is true that Rhine has\ngone on to suggest that direct causal transaction between a mental event\nand an extra-somatic physical event may be a process of the same kind as\nthat which occurs normally between a mind and the body it animates.\nNevertheless, \" PK \" is used primarily to refer to causal transactions which\nappear supernormal, and it seems best to limit its meaning to this sense.\nWe cannot, however, take the above property as a complete definition of\n\" PK \", for it would never occur to us to ask whether a mental event\nexerts direct causal influence on an extra-somatic physical event, unless\nwe already knew that these events were related by epistemological corre-\nspondence. All the cases of ostensible PK which have been, and can be,\ninvestigated are cases where the extra-somatic event corresponds epis-\ntemologically to an idea or volition, and it is this correspondence which\nmakes us suspect a causal connection. (Of course, the epistemological\ncorrespondence may be negative as well as positive. In a dice-throwing\nexperiment in which the agent is aiming at high-dice, a significant deficit,\n^ H. F. vSaltmarsh, Foreknowledge, p. 25, \" most precognitions are not immedi-\nately known to be such, they are not predictions in the sense that they are, at the\ntime of their occurrence, consciously recognised as having a reference to the\nfuture \".\n^ l7<\/f Soal and (iotdnev, \" Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy \", Proc.\nS.P.R., Vol. XLVII, pp. 77-8.\n\f178] The Expei imeiital Evidence for PK and Precognition 63\nas well as a significant surplus, of high-dice would be taken to indicate\nPK.) I shall define \" an instance of PK \" as the occurrence of certain\nrelations between a mental event and a physical event which occurs out-\nside the body associated with that mental event, the relations in question\nbeing (a) that the mental event exerts direct causal influence on the\nphysical event ;\n(h) that the mental event and the physical event are\nrelated by epistemological correspondence.\nIf these definitions are correct, they reveal that our concepts of PK\nand precognition are very similar in form. Each involves reference to a\npair of events related (a) causally and (b) epistemologically. The\ndifTerences between these concepts are :\n(i) In respect of the nature of the events which stand in these relations.\nWe may notice here that the kinds of events involved in PK are subclasses\nof the kinds of events involved in precognition {mental events being a sub-\nclass of human events : extra-somatic physical events being a sub-class of\nevents).\n(ii) In respect of the direction of the causal influence. In PK, the causal\ninfluence is from a mental event to a (simultaneous or later) extra-somatic\nphysical event. In precognition, the causal influence is from a later event\nto an earlier human event.\nThe latter difference requires some comment. For philosophers, the\nquestion of what we mean by \" causation \" raises many controversial\nissues which cannot be discussed here, but there are two points which\nwe should not evade :\n(i) Some philosophers have held that it is meaningless to speak of\ncausation as \" operating in a certain direction \" : have held that to assert\ncausal connection between y4-Iike events and i?-like events is merely to\nsay [a) that .4-like events are always accompanied by i?-like events, or\nare always followed or preceded at some characteristic interval by i?-like\nevents, and is not to say {b) that ^^-like events influence i?-like events in\nany sense in which i?-like events do not influence ^-like events. Now,\n\/\/ this view were accepted, PK and precognition would not be indepen-\ndent hypotheses (or concepts), but instead, PK would be a species of\nprecognition. For consider a case where we had a mental event followed\nby an extra-somatic physical event, these events being related by epis-\ntemological correspondence. Whatever evidence we might obtain that\nsuch events are causally connected, there would be, on the above view of\ncausation, no difference in meaning between describing this connection as\nan instance of PK and as an instance of precognition. For in such a\ncase the meaning of \" PK \" and \" precognition \" could only be dis-\ntinguished by reference to the direction of the causal influence.\n(ii) We might, however, maintain that there is one sense in which we\ncan (and do) inteUigibly speak of causation as operating in a certain direc-\ntion ; that the common sense criterion of the direction of causal influence\nis that it is always from earlier to later events. However, if this were our\nonly criterion of the direction of causal influence, we could not render\nintelligible our definition of \" precognition \", for what could we then\nmean by speaking of the causal influence of a later event on an earlier\nevent?\nLet us regard these considerations as a challenge, admitting that if PK\n\f64 C. W. K. Mundle [Part\nand precognition are to be intelligible as itidcpciidciit hypotheses, this must\nbe by virtue of some criterion of the direction of causal influence other\nthan the common sense criterion based on the temporal order of events.\nLet us turn now to the practical problems. Firstly, can we obtain\nexperimental evidence for PK,- which could not be otherwise explained?\nThis seems possible. It may have already been done. However, it seems\nclear that many PK experiments which were, prima facie, successful, have\nfailed in a fairly obvious way to eliminate the possibility that the significant\nscoring was due to precognitive ESP. In this section of my paper, I could\nnot, and shall not, attempt a complete and detailed examination of all the\nPK experiments which have been performed. My purpose is, first, to\nspecify certain conditions which must be fulfilled by an ideal experiment,\nand which have not apparently been fulfilled in many (perhaps all?) earlier\nexperiments : and then, to suggest an experimental design which would\nclose the loopholes which I am considering. I shall refer to some of the\nDuke experiments in order to illustrate the nature of the loopholes in\nquestion, but I do not wish thereby to detract from the value of the\npioneer work which has been done at Duke University.\nThe first loophole I want to consider has probably been noticed by\nmany psychical researchers, but I shall now elaborate it, to make my\nargument clear, and shall later refer to it as Hypothesis i\n.\nIn the dice-throwing experiments, the person who selects the target to\nbe \" willed \" by the \" agent \" may (unconsciously) precognise what face\n(or group of faces, in high-dice or low-dice calling) is going to prepond-\nerate above chance-average in the next throw or run, set or series : and\nhis choice of targets (including decisions when to change targets) may be\ninfluenced by this supernormally acquired information. In many of the\nDuke experiments, it seems to have been left to the \" agent \" to select the\ntarget : but even if this is done by an experimenter, we may assume that\nthis experimenter hopes that the test will succeed, so that a motive would\nexist to account for the direction of his \" precognitive faculty \" in this\nway, and for the use to which, we are supposing, he unconsciously puts it.\nAn objectionable feature of many experiments is, then, that it has been\nleft to the spontaneous choices of agent or experimenter to determine the\ntargets at which the agent should aim. Rhine may be able to show us\nthat the declines within sets and runs are independent of changes of target\nto a degree which renders hypothesis i most unplausible. I shall, how-\never, argue that the ideal method of eliminating hypothesis i is to have\nthe targets selected in a random way by a machine, selected in such a way\nthat if precognition of the faces which will preponderate occurs in any\nmind, this mind could not use this information in order to eflFect extra-\nchance scoring loitJiout exercising control by PK over the target selecting\nmachine. Howe\\ er, before we can state what sort of mechanical selection\nof targets would achieve this object, we must consider a further loophole\nwhich was left open in many of the earlier experiments. This may now\nbe stated briefly, and I shall refer to it in future as Hypothesis 2.\nIn the dice-throwing experiments the extra-chance scoring may be due\nto control, normal or abnormal, by the agent of the processes in his own\nbody which \" trigger \" the movements of tlie dice.\n\flyS] TJie Experimental Evidence for PK and Precognition 65\nHypothesis 2 may appear, at first, to be merely the repetition of an\nobvious criticism. It has often been suggested, for example, that when\ndice are hand-thrown, some people may be able to get a preponderance of\nthe results they wish by means of a normally acquired manual dexterity.\nHypothesis 2 is intended, however, to put us on our guard against possi-\nbilities which are more unexpected. Psychical researchers have treated\nseriously the possibility of hyperaesthesia in connection with ESP.\nExperimenters have recognised that they ought to consider whether, and\nif so to what extent, ostensible ESP may be mediated by processes occur-\nring in the afferent nervous system, assuming abnormal sensitiveness and\ndiscrimination on the part of the senses : they ought equally to consider\nwhether, and if so to what extent, ostensible PK may be mediated by\nprocesses occurring in the efferent nervous system, assuming abnormal\ncontrol of such processes. The precautions to eliminate hypothesis 2 in\nPK experiments should be as rigorous as the precautions to eliminate\nhyperaesthesia in ESP experiments.\nThere is no doubt that hypothesis 2 can be applied to many of the Duke\nexperiments : for example, to all of those in which the agent performed\na manual movement which constituted a dilTerential condition of the sub-\nsequent movements of the dice, and hence was a cause factor in deter-\nmining the final resting positions of the dice on the table. Take, for\nexample, the experiments in which the dice were manually replaced in\n\" the same \" positions on a starting line, and, after a release-movement\nwhich was manually initiated, ran down a corrugated surface on to the\ntable. The physicist could argue here that you would get the same\nresult from every trial, if each of the following conditions were fulfilled :\n{a) the same dice are always in exactly the same starting positions,\n{b) the release movement is always identical in speed and direction,\n(c) the positions of all the surfaces, which the dice strike in rolling,\nremain unchanged.\nBut no one would expect conditions (\u00ab) and {b) to have been fulfilled,\nsince they depended on manual movements. If we grant that the precise\npositions of the dice at the moment of release and the speed and\/or direc-\ntion of the release movement were almost certainly variables as between\ndifferent throws, then we might explain the significant scoring by refer-\nence to abnormal control of the manual movements in question.\nDifferently designed experiments would provide different kinds of\nopportunity for abnormal manual control as a factor which might affect\nscoring. Consider the experiment in which dice were released from a\nrotating cage when the agent pulls a string. In this case, even if the speed\nand direction of the agent's pull were causally irrelevant, the timing of his\npull would have been relevant. In the rotating cage the dice are presum-\nably in motion relative to each other, to the cage and to the table. At one\ninstant the spatial distribution and motion of the dice would be such that\nrelease then would result in an excess of high dice, at another instant . . .\nin an excess of low dice. Significant scoring with this set-up might be\ndue to the agent's abnormal control of the timing of his motor behaviour.\nThis hypothesis is of theoretical importance, for it would enable us to\naccept Rhine's facts, without regarding any mental events as proximate\ndifferential conditions of any physical events other than those occurring\n\f66 C. W. K. Mundle [Part\nin the corresponding brain. Assuming that volitions are remote causal\nancestors ot some extra-chance hits, they would be performing this\nrole \" by normal channels \", i.e. via brain, efferent nerves and muscles.\nThe old mystery of how mental events control cerebral events would\nremain, would indeed be heightened by virtue of the extraordinary dis-\ncrimination which, upon this hypothesis, we should be attributing to the\ncausal efficacy of volitions. However, the physicist who ignores this\nproblem (how cerebral events are determined) could, on our present\nhypothesis, still maintain [a) that we need invoke no causal connections\nbetween events which are not linked by a spatio-temporally continuous\nseries of events, and (\/;) that all the necessary conditions of any physical\nevent are contained in prior physical events and states. (I don't know\nwhether the physicists have decided whether they want to maintain these\npropositions. They seem, when discussing Quantum Mechanics, to be\nabandoning both the Principle of Continuity and Determinism in the\n\" microscopic sphere \", yet they seem to wish to retain both in the\n\" macroscopic sphere \".)\nIf hypothesis 2 is true, some human beings have an unexpected faculty,\nbut one which is not at all like PK as Rhine conceives it, and as it was\ndefined above : for we defined PK in terms of direct causal influence\nof a mental event on an extra-somatic physical event ; but if hypothesis 2\nis true, the causal connection between these events is not direct, but is\nmediated by a continuous chain of physical events which start in the\nagent's body.\nCan we eliminate hypothesis 2? Can a person's volition influence the\ncourse of events in external bodies except by way of motor processes (or\nother physical processes of known kinds) in his own body.? It seems easy\nto eliminate the agent's bodily movements qua difl^erential conditions of\nthe events which he seeks to influence. We simply debar the agent from\nreplacing dice in the release mechanism and from initiating the release\nmovement. But this is not enough. On the hypotheses in question,\nagents have unexpected powers of controlling their movements\u2014then\npresumably experimenters may have like powers\u2014so that any person who\nmanually replaced the dice or initiates the release-movement might be\nresponsible for the excess-hits. (In the Duke experiments, the experi-\nmenters knew the current target, and, we may assume, were hoping\n\u2014\nwhether consciously or not\u2014that the experiment would succeed : and\neven if the experimenters did not know the target by normal means, they\nmight have ascertained it by ESP.) We require, therefore, an experiment\nin which all the events which the physicist regards as difl^erential condi-\ntions of the events which the agent seeks to influence are determined by\nmachine. The use of a machine will not serve our purpose, if this machine\nis operated by a manual movement, unless this manual movement is\nrendered causally irrelevant to the physical processes which determine\nthe events which the agent seeks to influence. Now this point applies\nto the elimination of hypothesis i as well as that of hypothesis 2. For, if\nas previously suggested, we use a machine to select targets, hypothesis i\nwill not be conclusively eliminated unless any manual movements, by\nwhich the target-selecting-machine is operated, are causally irrelevant to\nthe physical processes which determine the target selection. If this were\n\f178] The Experimental Evidence for PK and Precognition 67\nnot so, the significant scoring might be attributed to precognition, plus\nabnormal manual control of the targct-selecting-machine.\nLet us consider now how these requirements can be met. It is probably\npossible to eliminate hypotheses i and 2 in dice-throwing experiments,\nand this may already have been done. I wish, however, to suggest one\nmethod by which our aim could, in principle, be fulfilled, namely by an\nexperiment employing the \" random selector \" designed by Mr R.\nWilson.^ This is an electronic device which will give a random series of\nselections from four alternative events, e.g. the lighting of one or other of\nfour lamps of different colours. Wilson designed this machine for ESP\ntests, and was, for this purpose, content to have the operation of the\nmachine initiated by the manual pressing of a button. One of our pur-\nposes being to eliminate hypothesis 2, we cannot allow this, since the\ntiming of the push would (if I understand the machine) constitute a\ndifferential condition of the selection. We must, on hypothesis 2, take\nseriously even the possibility of abnormal control of the timing of finger\nmovements to within 1\/3200 of a second, which is the \" critical period\n'\"^\nfor selection by this machine. Let us therefore have the operation\nof the random selector triggered by the closing of a delay switch, whose\n\" spread is substantially larger than 1\/3200 second. (This should\ngive us a wide choice of types of delay switch!) An essential specifica-\ntion for the triggering mechanism will be that it is designed so as to\nsatisfy any physicist that no variations in the timing or force (or other\nphysical characteristics) of the manual push on the button can, by any\nknown physical process, affect the operation of the delay switch and hence\nof the selector.\nIn my proposed experiment we shall employ two of Wilson's random\nselectors : let us label them A and B. A single manual movement will\ninitiate the operation of both machines, but machine A will be operated\n(and one of its four lamps be lit) a few seconds before machine B is\noperated. To effect this, the same manual movement will simultaneously\nactivate two delay switches : the closing of the first switch will trigger\nmachine A, the closing of the second will trigger machine B. The role\nof the agent will be to \" will \" that the lamp which is going to be lit by\nmachine B shall correspond in colour to the lamp which has just been\nlit by machine A. For each trial, the sequence of events will be as\nfollows : An experimenter presses a button at time and thereby {a)\noperates delay switch i which closes at time T., and thereby operates\nmachine A by which the agent is informed at time of the alternative\nwhich he has to \" will \" : {h) operates delay switch 2 which closes at time\nT'4, thereby operating machine B which produces one of the four alterna-\ntive events at time T-^. The timelags 7\", to 1\\ and to Tj will be\nnegligible. Timelag 7\\ to could be in the order of a seconcl or less.\nTimelag to [i.e. the period delay switch 2 takes to close) could be\nin the order of 5 to 10 seconds. The agent will be willing the correspon-\ndence of the B event to the A event during the period to T-^. It would\n^ For technical details of the apparatus, see Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XLVIII, Part 174.\n^ By \" critical period \" I refer to the period, at any instant during which opera-\ntion of the machine would cause the same lamp to light.\n^ By the \" spread \" of a dela>' switch, I refer to the average deviation from its\naverage period of operation.\n\f68 C. li: K. Mtmdie [Part\nbe an advantage if this period can be adjusted to meet agents' preferences\nby adjusting the average timelag of delay switch 2. Other \" frills \" like\nthe automatic recording of A and B events could easily be incorporated.\nIf both these machines select alternatives randomly, then, in the\nabsence of any PK interference, the correspondence between A events\nand B events will approximate to chance average (one hit in four). If\nthe results obtained, in (and only in) the presence of an agent willing\ncorrespondence, yield a significant deviation from chance-average, it\nwould surely be impossible to explain this merely by reference to super-\nnormal cognition. Even if one (or both) of the machines fails to give a\nperfectly random series and reveals some bias, this need not matter, for\nwe can determine the chance-level of correspondence empirically by\n\" control runs \" of a number equal to the \" real runs \", and regularly\ninterspersed with the latter : the only difference between a \" control run\n\"\nand a \" real run \" being the presence of a suitable agent who is willing\ncorrespondence.\nSuppose that this experiment succeeds in the sense that the correspon-\ndence between A and B events obtained in the presence of an agent who is\nwilling correspondence differs significantly from the correspondence\nobtained in circumstances which differ only in the absence of the agent\nwilling correspondence. I cannot conceive how we could attempt to\nexplain such facts without invoking PK. Even omniscience on anyone's\npart\u2014never mind a little precognition\u2014would not explain the facts.\nPrecognition which was loo per cent efficient, and which informed some-\none of the next A event and the next B event every time (or informed\nhim instantaneously of all future members of the A series and the B\nseries) would explain nothing\u2014it would merely furnish advance informa-\ntion of the phenomena which demand explanation.\nThere are surely only two ways in which results of the kind we are\nconsidering would be explicable in terms of supernormal cognition without\ninvoking PK.\n{a) If precognition by any mind of the next B event could influence,\nby any means other than PK, the selection of the corresponding\nA event. (My hypothesis i illustrated a way in which this sort\nof thing might happen in the Duke experiments.)\n{b) If information about an A event (whenever or however acquired)\ncould be used to influence, by any means other than PK, the\ndetermination of the next B event. (My hypothesis 2 illustrated\na way in which this sort of thing might happen in the Duke\nexperiments.)\nThe proposed experiment would eliminate both of these possibilities.\nIf anyone precognises the next B event, he cannot use this information to\ninfluence selection of the corresponding A event except by PK influence\non the A machine. And equally, precognition occurring before time Tj\nof the next A event would not enable the experimenter who presses\nthe button to influence the selection of the next B event by any known\nphysical process.\nIf the proposed experiment yielded the results we are envisaging, I for\none would be compelled to acknowledge PK as a vera causa ;\ncompelled\nto acknowledge, that is to say, that a mental event is sometimes a proximate\n\f178] 21ie Experimental Evidence for PK and Precognilion 69\ndifferential condition ot physical c\\cnts occurring in regions other than\nthat occupied by the associated organism.\nThe next stage in our enquiry is to ask whether we can obtain experi-\nmental evidence for precognition, which cannot be otherwise explained.\nLet us, for ease of reference, describe as Hypothesis 3, the theory that all\nostensible precognition can be explained away if we invoke PK and\/or\nnon-precognitive ESP. Hypothesis 3 appears much more difficult to\neliminate than hypotheses i and 2. If hypotheses i antl 2 are eliminated\nin the PK experiment suggested above (or by any other experiment), the\ncase for postulating precognition will be substantially weakened. For\nconsider in general terms the difficulty which has to be overcome in find-\ning unambiguous evidence for precognition.\nLet us assume that an idea or a volition is something which can persist\nin a person's mind when it is not introspectible, and can thus bridge the\ntime-gap between a so-called precognition and the event which verities it.\nThen a so-called precognition (A), and the event (1) which verifies A\",\nmay both be caused by the same persistent idea or volition (Z)\u2014this\nwould explain the epistemological correspondence between A' and i'.\nAssume, for simplicity, that Z belongs to the person (A) in whom\nA' occurs. (Our explanation can easily be adapted to meet different\ncases.) Then if Y is a mental event occurring in a person other than A,\nZ may cause Y by way of telepathy ; and if T is a physical event occurring\noutside the body of A, Z may cause Y by way of PK. (If A', i and Z all\nbelong to A, the explanation will fall within the scope of normal psycho-\nlogy.) Unless, or until, we can empirically determine the limits of both\ntelepathic and PK infiuence, how can we possibly eliminate hypothesis 3 ?\nBearing in mind this difficulty, let us examine the evidence for precogni-\ntion offered by the experiments of Rhine, Soal and Carington.\nProfessor Rhine devised a very elaborate experiment to confirm the\noccurrence of precognition. ^ He considered hypothesis 3 and attempted\nto eliminate it. The first stage was to ask a subject to guess the order of a\npack of cards after it had been shuffled manually at a later date. It was\nthen recognised that the subject's \" guesses \" might influence the final\norder of the pack by influencing the mind, and hence the fingers, of the\nperson who shuffled the pack. To eliminate this possibility, it was decided\nto shuffle the cards by a machine. Then it was recognised that the\nsubject's \" guesses \" might perhaps exert a PK influence on the shuffling\nmachine. It was to eliminate this possibility that Rhine devised his\nculminating experiment. This involved having the cards cut after they\nhad been mechanically shuffled ; and having both the cut and the duration\nof the shuffling determined, in accordance with rules fixed in advance,\nby the figures for the daily temperature extremes obtained from a specified\nnewspaper several days after the guesses had been recorded. Rhine\nclaims that this experimental design eliminates PK, because \" the tem-\nperature itself would have to be modified by the hypothetical effect in\nquestion [i.e. PK] and this seems considerably more incredible tiian that\nthe [shuffling] machine might be influenced directly \".^\n^ See T\/ie Reach of the Mind, pp. 60-4, and Jnunial uj Punipsyetiology.

MimdJc [Part\nWhen Rhine, in The Reach of the Mind, claims without quahfication\nthat this cuhninating expLiimcnt yielded significant results, his statement\nmight be considered misleading. For we find on turning to the report\nin the Journal of Parapsychology that the results were not significant in\nany obvious sense. After 57,550 trials the deviation of hits was only +11.\nAnd, taking the results as a whole, the distribution of hits within runs\n(of 25 trials) was not significant, nor was the distribution of hits within\nsegments (of 5 trials). The feature which led Rhine to judge the results\nsignificant is what he describes as covariation between the salience ratio\nfor runs and the salience ratio for segments. (\" Salience ratio \" refers to\na measure of the tendency for hits to be concentrated at the ends, rather\nthan the middle, of a run or a segment.) This recherche feature is not\npresent to a very striking degree. (Rhine gives P = -ooi6.) Dr Soal has\nsuggested to me that this feature of the results may have been a\n\" statistical artefact \".\nHowever, even if this experiment had yielded results which were\nobviously significant, e.g. a significant deviation of hits, I suggest that we\nwould not have to look far for a flaw in Rhine's argument that the method\neliminated PK. For the temperature readings were presumably deter-\nmined by someone looking at a thermometer, and a thermometer is a\nmechanical device no more complicated than a card-shuffling machine.\nIf we admit, as Rhine does, that shuflling machines may be influenced by\nPK, why should we assume that thermometers are immune from such\ninfluence.'' In Rhine's experiment, a difference of one degree in a tempera-\nture reading would make a vast difference to the final order of the pack.\nLet us turn now to the classic experiments with Mr Basil Shackelton,\nconducted by Dr Soal and Mrs Goldney. An important feature of these\nexperiments was that the \" telepathic targets \" {i.e. the events which\nShackleton was trying to guess) were multiply determined\u2014by one method\nin the Prepared Random Numbers (PRN) series, by a different method in\nthe Counters series. (I am not going to examine the PRN experiments in\ndetail, since it seems to me that we could explain the results without\ninvoking either precognition or PK : we merely have to suppose that\nShackleton ascertained the current list of random numbers by telepathy\nfrom EA or from Soal, and ascertained the current code by telepathy from\nA. The only puzzle would be to explain why he tended to (so to speak)\n\" read off the answers \" one or two steps ahead of the number to which\nEA was attending.)\nThe method of selecting the target by counters may be briefly described\nhere. EA (experimenter controlling agent) sits at one side of a table,\nA (agent) at the other side, a vertical screen being interposed between\nthem with a small aperture in its centre. Two hundred counters, forty of\neach of five different colours, are placed in a cloth bag or a bowl on EA's\nside of the screen ; the five colours correspond to the five positions in\nwhich the animal cards are placed on A's side of the screen. The animal\ncards are shuffled and placed face down in these positions after each run\nof fifty calls. Thus the code between colours and cards is changed each\nrun. The procedure was that EA selected, manually and solely by touch,\na counter from the bag or bowl and immediately showed it at the aperture\n\f178] TJie Expei iniciital Evidence for PK and Precognition 71\nin the screen. A, on seeing this, hfted, and looked at the face of the\ncorresponding card. To assist A in remembering the fixed code relating\ncounter colours to card positions, a counter of appropriate colour is placed\nabove each card position.\nIn this case, it seems possible to explain the significant deviation of\nShackleton's ( + i) and ( + 2) scores in terms of \" delayed-action \" PK or\n\" delayed-action \" telepathy. The events which the \" percipient \" (P)\nwas trying to guess, were partially determined by EA's manual movements\nwhich occurred two to three seconds after P recorded his guess. We\nmight eliminate precognition by supposing that P's \" guess \" at time\n{i.e. his thought of a certain card-face) sometimes infiuenced the finger-\nmovements which EA made two or three seconds later in such a way as\nto result in EA's selection of a counter of corresponding colour. This\ncausal influence might be of the PK variety if P's idea directly influenced\nEA's fingers or brain, or it might be telepathic if P's idea directly influenced\nthe mind of EA and thus indirectly guided processes in EA's brain and\nfingers.\nI suggest that we need not worry about the timclag between P's guess\nand EA's finger movements. Assuming that an \" idea \" persists for some\ntime after it has been the object of conscious attention, it may be that\nwith some agents an idea acquires maximum PK-efficacy (and\/or tele-\npathic-efficacy) when it is fading, or has just faded, below the threshold\nof attention. We might on these lines explain Shackleton's tendency to\nget ( + i) hits at normal speed and ( +2) hits at rapid speed. (Ehrenwald^\nhas produced a little evidence suggesting that an idea has maximum\ntelepathic efiicacy when it is in the preconscious or unconscious mind.)\nBefore we try to assess the plausibility of applying hypothesis 3 to\nSoal's results, there are two considerations which should be taken into\naccount.\n(i) Dr Soal and Mrs Goldney explicitly considered the telepathic\nvariation of hypothesis 3, and carried out two series of trials with the\npurpose of testing this possibility. These are described in the section\nheaded \" Special Experiment with Counters. (Influence of (P) on\n(EA) ) which requires careful study. From these experiments they\ndrew the modest conclusion\n\u2014\" we obtain no evidence that B.S. can\ninfluence K.M.G.'s selection of counters from the bowl \". (K. M.\nGoldney acted as EA in these experiments.) It might appear, however,\nthat one would be justified in drawing the more positive conclusion\n\u2014\nthat these experiments provided evidence that B.S. did not influence\nK.M.G.'s finger-movements in either of the ways we are envisaging in\nconnection with hypothesis 3, and that hypothesis 3 is thus rendered very\nunplausible as an explanation of B.S.'s ( + i) and ( + 2) scoring. I suggest,\nhowever, that this conclusion would go too far.\nIn each of these special experiments, the conditions difl^ered from those\nin which B.S. got significant results, and difl^ered in some respect which\nmay well have been relevant to his failure on these occasions. In the first\nof these experiments, B.S.'s choices of cards were determined for him by a\nlist of random numbers, whereas in all of the other experiments his\nchoices were spontaneous. This difference did not, however, occur in the\n^ Telepathy and Medical Psychology. '-\nOp. cit., pp. 73-5.\n\f72 C. II'. K. Mundle [Part\nsecond of these experiments when B.S.'s choices were spontaneous. We\nmust notice, however, that in this experiment B.S. was being aslted to do\nsomething completely different from what he was asked to do in all of\nthe successful experiments. He was now being asked to zvill that K.M.G.\nshould select a counter of the colour which he had chosen,^ whereas in\nall of the other experiments he was asked to guess something. I suggest\nthat B.S. may have been able to influence K.M.G.'s fingers, but only\nwhen certain conditions were fulfilled ; and one of the necessary condi-\ntions may have been that B.S.'s state of mind should have been one of\n\" trying to guess something \". If anyone asks why this should have been\nso, I should suggest that B.S. had reason to be specially confident in his\nguessing capacities, in view of his past successes, which, whatever their\nreal nature, had been interpreted to him as supernormal cognition.\nIt may seem paradoxical to suggest that B.S. could exert PK influence,\nbut only when he was trying to do something else. But is this really\nparadoxical.? Suppose that this special experiment had yielded significant\nresults\u2014could we then have been sure that B.S.'s choices were influencing\nK.M.G.'s choices, rather than the reverse, merely because B.S. was told\nto will something and not to guess something? Can we, in any of the\nexperiments, take B.S.'s instructions (or his own description of his state\nof mind) as a reliable criterion of the nature of the causal transactions in-\nvolved? Surely we are not entitled to do this, any more than we are en-\ntitled, in dice-throwing experiments where the \" agent \" chooses the target,\nto assume that extra-chance scoring is due to PK rather than precogni-\ntion merely because the subject was told to will, and not to guess.\n(ii) There is another argument which might be advanced to show that\nhypothesis 3 cannot plausibly be applied to Shackleton's results. It\nmight be argued that we could not explain these results merely by refer-\nence to a single series of \" acts \" of PK (or to a single series of \" acts \" of\ntelepathy) from P to EA : that hypothesis 3 would only become plausible\nif we postulated further series of supernormal \" acts \". Would we not\nhave to elaborate some such story as the following :\n[a] that the current code between colours and card-faces was ascer-\ntained by P by telepathy from A.\n(\/)) that the relative positions of EA's fingers and the counters at the\ncrucial moments was ascertained by P by clairvoyance,\n(f) that P used the above information to guide the PK influence on\nEA's fingers.\nA difl'erent story would be required on the alternative version of hypo-\nthesis 3 (in which P influences EA by telepathy), but this story, too, would\ninvolve three distinct series of supernormal \" acts \".\n\/\/ hypothesis 3 had to be interpreted in this way, then an argument\nagainst it might be elaborated as follows. The average efficiency of each\nof the three series of supernormal \" acts \" must have been considerably\nhigher than their net resultant efficiency. But Shackleton's efficiency in\n( + 1) and ( + 2) scoring was in fact high (compared with the usual level\nof scoring in ESP experiments), e.g. in several long runs Shackleton's\nefficiency was in the order of 12-5 per cent true cognitions. Hypothesis 3\n'\nThe experimental record is not explicit on this point, but I have obtained\nconfirmation from Dr Soal that this is what B.S. was asked to do in this experiment.\nI\n\flyS] The Experimental Evidence for PK and Precognition 73\nwould thus require us to postulate an average efficiency of about 50 per\ncent for each of the series of supernormal acts which we are invoking.\nThis looks very unplausible. One might think that hypothesis 3 could\nbe rendered progressively less plausible by devising experiments which\nwould require more and more series of supernormal \" acts \".\nI do not think the above argument is conclusive, or even strong, but I\nthink it deserves careful analysis, as it raises some fundamental issues.\nIt seems plausible to say that B.S. could only have influenced EA's fingers\nappropriately if B.S. was guided by supernormally acquired information.\nThe main issue here is whether PK implies ESP\u2014a conclusion which\nRhine took to be certain when he wrote The Reach of the Mind. We\nrarely find Rhine using an a priori argument, but he does so in order to\njustify this conclusion.^ This argument has already been challenged by\nProfessors Broad^ and Price. ^ Rhine's conclusion is reached by an argu-\nment from analogy, and the analogy is not a strong one. He is assuming\nthat PK must be analogous to normal voluntary action in which we\ninterfere with environmental objects, in so far as both must be guided by\nperception of some kind : and since normal sense-perception cannot\nsupply the data by which PK could be intelligently guided, he concludes\nthat the data must be supplied by ESP. But since PK is so strikingly\ndifferent from normal voluntary action in some respects (notably in not\nusing the efferent nervous system), can we argue that PK must resemble it\nin another respect\u2014in being a perceptually guided process, in being an\nintelligent response to information.^\nProfessor Price has suggested that we may be wrong in thinking of PK\nas a perceptually guided process, and that perhaps the appropriate con-\nceptual model is that of ideo-motor action. The sort of occurrences which\nPrice presumably had in mind were cases where the thought of a bodily\nmovement, e.g. yawning or stretching a limb, issues automatically into\nthe corresponding behaviour, provided that it is not inhibited by some\nother idea. Does anyone believe that the idea of yawning can only issue\ninto a yawn if it is guided by information regarding the physical changes\nin the brain which precede or accompany yawning? Surely we do not\nwant to attribute to the unconscious mind of every child a knowledge of\nphysiology far exceeding that attained by physiologists merely because it\nusually yawns when it thinks of yawning! Now the point of assimilating\nPK and ideo-motor action is that it suggests that, in PK, an idea may be\nrealising itself in an external physical event without being guided by\ninformation about the physical mechanisms which precede or accompany\nthe event in question.\nI wonder if it might be possible to test experimentally whether PK\nis guided by ESP. This may seem a tall order, but I shall suggest a\nway in which something might be subtracted from the probability\nof this proposition. Rhine's acceptance of this proposition may have\nbeen partially conditioned by his exclusive use of dice-throwing in PK\n'\nIbid., p. 106, \" If PK had been discovered without any previous knowledge of\nESP, the latter would immediately have had to be assumed to make the former\nintelligible,\" cl seq.\nProc, Vol. XLVIII, Part 172, p. 22.\n* Mind, Vol. LVIII, No. 231, p. 392, et seq.\n\f74 C. IV. K. Mundle [Part\nexperiments. (We all know, or think we know, what sort of interference\nis required to alter the course of a moving body.) I wonder if Rhine\nwould have concluded that PK implies ESP if some of his PK experiments\nhad been designed around electronic devices? Suppose we use Wilson's\nrandom selector and try some comparative PK tests between :\n(A) agents who are scientifically educated and to whom the mudiis\noperandi of the selector is fully explained, and\n(B) agents who are scientifically illiterate and not \" mechanically-\nminded \", and who are told a simple false story about the modus\noperandi.\nIf the scoring of Group B were as high as that of Group A, it would be\nvery difficult to entertain seriously the view that PK must be guided by\nESP. Let anyone who thinks it possible, try to formulate a detailed\naccount of how PK could be so guided in the case of Group B. He\nwould, I think, find it necessary to postulate supernormally acquired data,\nand powers of instantaneous calculation, so extensive as to be well-nigh\nincredible.\nHow can we apply this line of thought to the experiments with\nShackleton? We must admit that B.S.'s thoughts could only have influ-\nenced EA's fingers appropriately if his thoughts influenced them in con-\nformity ivith the current code relating colours and card-positions. But\nthis code was known by A from the beginning of each run. A possible\nexplanation of the results is that EA's fingers were influenced jointly by\nB.S.'s guesses and A's knowledge of the code : or\u2014to put it diff^erently\n\u2014\nthat the function of PK agency (or telepathic agency as it may have been)\nwas split between B.S. and A. This explanation might have appeared\nfar-fetched before Dr Soal had made the \" telepathy \" experiment with\nMrs Stewart,^ in which she obtained highly significant results from two\nagents, neither of whom knew the targets. This experiment indicates\nthat thoughts belonging to two different people can jointly influence the\nfinger movements of a third person. (Notice that we have no means of\ntelling whether Mrs Stewart's finger movements in recording her guesses\nwere influenced by PK or telepathy.)\nThe argument we are dealing with is that my explanation of B.S.'s\nresults implies the occurrence of more than one series of supernormal\nacts. Let us see where the same argument would lead us if we applied it\nto explaining Mrs Stewart's results. These, it would be said, must have\nbeen due to at least two series of supernormal acts {e.g. either Mrs\nStewart must have performed two acts of telepathy, or else she must have\n\" tapped the mind \" of one agent, who had \" tapped the mind \" of the\nother agent.) However, if this were so, we should expect Mrs Stewart's\nscoring to be substantially lower in this experiment than in the experiments\nwhere only one agent was used. The results belie this interpretation, for\nDr Soal tells us that tlie scoring in this experiment was not appreciably\nlower than in the others. We must conclude then, that processes which\noccur in the minds of different people can be as efficient in the joint\nproduction of supernormal effects, as are processes which occur in a single\nmind. This conclusion surely invalidates the criticism, which we have\nbeen considering, of my alternative explanation of B.S.'s results.\n' The Experimental Situation in Psychical Research, pp. 42-3.\n\f178] Tlie Exf'ei iiiieiita! Evidence for PK and Precognition 75\nI wish now to consider Carington's classic experiments in tlie para-\nnormal cognition of drawings, which furnished our first experimental\nevidence for \" temporal displacement \".^ Can we formulate a version of\nhypothesis 3 by wliich the ostensible precognition can be explained away?\nI may well be muddled, but I cannot think of any way of doing this\nwhich seems at all plausible.\nPrima facie, we might think that there is as much scope here for\ninvoking PK interference as a factor determining the selection of \" tele-\npathic targets \", as there was in the case of Soal's experiments. Carington\ntells us that \" to select the subject matter of each drawing, I opened a copy\nof Chamber's Mathematical Tables at random, noted the last digit of the\nfirst three or four entries encountered, turned to the corresponding page\nof Webster's Dictionary and took as the subject for the drawing the first\nreasonably drawable word found on or after that page \". This was done\nand the drawing made within half an hour of zero hour for its display.\nMight we not then suppose that a PK infiuence was exerted on Carington's\nfinger- (or eye-) movements (or a telepathic influence exerted on\nCarington's mind) to determine the selection of the \" original \" drawing?\n(The fact that Carington opened the Tables at random seems to give more\nscope for such interference than if he had followed a set principle in\nopening the Tables.) But by ivhom can we suppose such influence to\nhave been exerted?\nThe novel feature of Carington's results was the clustering of extra-\nchance hits, more or less symmetrically around the occasions on which\nthe drawings were displayed, yielding a curve which approximates to an\ninverted U-curve with twin peaks corresponding to the occasions, two\nbefore and two after the display of the originals. Being a fool about\nmathematics, I could not try to apply hypothesis 3 to Carington's results\nas they stand : for the latter do not reveal any regular curve with respect\nto this or that individual original drawing. Carington's curves emerge as\na result of statistical aggregation and analysis of his data. I cannot see\nhow to try to apply hypothesis 3 at all, unless I think in terms of a simpli-\nfied model, that is, unless I assume that the inverted U-curve would\napply to hits made on a single original on different occasions before and\nafter its display. I shall assume that if Carington's curve is a \" lawful\nphenomenon \" and not a freak, it would be exhibited by the hits on any\nsingle original if we ran a series of experiments with a much larger number\nof percipients than Carington employed. Strictly, then, I am using, as\nthe premise of my argument, not Carington's data as they stand, but an\ninterpolation. My argument will have no probative value unless we can\nconfirm by further experiments that this interpolation is warranted.\nSuppose, then, that we find the inverted U-curve in the hits made on\ndifTerent occasions by many percipients on one original drawing. In that\ncase, to whose agency could we attribute PK or telepathic influence on\nthe selection of the original? The number of different percipients getting\nextra-chance hits would increase during the days (weeks) before the display\nof the original, and would decline in a similar way during the days\n(weeks) ?fter the display. Could we explain the facts by supposing that\none of the \" percipients \", call him P, has an idea or complex which has\n1 Proc, Vol. XLVI, Part 162.\n\f76 C. W. K. Mundle [Part\nPK efficacy and\/or telepathic efficacy?\u2014by supposing that P's complex\ninfluences supernormally the selection by the experimenter of the original,\nand influences supernormally the bodies or minds of other \" percipients\n\"\nso as to make them draw likenesses of this original? To say this may at\nflrst sound plausible, but in fact this theory would contribute nothing\ntowards explaining the peculiarities of the results, namely the particular\nshape of the curve, and its position on the time-base (or \" occasion-base \").\nWhy should the hypothetical complex of P produce an increasing (and\ndecreasing) number of hits by other percipients before (and after) the\noccasion of display? If the display of the original performs no indepen-\ndent causal role, why should not the assumed PK and\/or telepathic-\ninfluence of the hypothetical complex of P be randomly distributed\nthroughout the experiment ? I can see no way of answering these questions\nunless we make ad hoc assumptions about the properties of the hypotheti-\ncal complex of P ; unless we say that the PK or telepathic efficacy of this\ncomplex waxes and wanes in phase with the \" hits curve \". (Even if we\nsay this, we have not explained the awkward fact that the peaks of the\nhits curve occur before and after the occasion of display, i.e. before and\nafter the only time at which P's complex is supposed to influence the\nexperimenter who selects the original.)\nBut what sort of a theory is this? Surely a preposterous one. The data\nare that a single known event (the display of the original) occurs at the\n(temporal) centre of a cluster of similar events. Does it make sense to\noflier as a causal explanation of these facts a story according to which all\nof the known events are efli^ects of some unverifiable entity : according to\nwhich the peculiar pattern of the known events are \" explained \" by\nassuming that the \" powers \" of the hypothetical entity vary in a similar\npattern?\nSurely it is methodologically unsound to explain the characteristics of\nknown events by attributing them to a duplicate set of characteristics\nbelonging to unverifiable entities which are invoked ad hoc : unsound, at\nany rate, when it is possible to explain the facts without doing this sort\nof thing. And in the case in question, we can explain the temporal\nclustering of the hits by regarding them as the several effects of a single\nknown event which occurred at the (temporal) centre of the cluster. The\nobvious advantages of this last explanation are (i) that it is much the\nsimplest hypothesis, and (2) that all the entities involved in this explana-\ntion are empirically known occurrences. These are not perhaps decisive\nreasons for choosing the latter hypothesis. In other sciences, the relative\nsimplicity of a hypothesis is counted as a reason for preference ; but\nperhaps we should attach less weight to this criterion in psychical research,\nfor the facts seem very complicated and the truth cannot be very simple.\nAnd regarding the second consideration, I think (and here I disagree with\nCarington) that we are not likely to make great progress in understanding\nsupernormal phenomena if we adhere to a strictly empiricist philosophy.\nMust we not, for example, postulate unconscious mental processes? Yet\nthese are unverifiable entities. Thus our argument has not, strictly\nspeaking, proved anything. All we can say is that the obvious explanation\nof the facts seems preferable to a version of hypothesis 3 on the grounds\nof simplicity and of the principle \" empiricism as far as possible \".\n\f178] The Experimental Evidence for PK and Precognition 77\nI think, however, that I can see a third reason for accepting the obvious\nexplanation : it is the sort of reason I should put to a fellow-philosopher\n\u2014\nbut he might (and others probably will) find it inconclusive. I suggest\nthat the following complex relational property (a) is one of the criteria by\nwhich we recognise causal connection and by which we distinguish a\ncause {i.e. a differential condition) from its effects.\n\" Spatial (or spatio-temporal) clustering around a central event or pro-\ncess of a set of events or processes which are, structurally and\/ or\nqualitatively, similar to each other.\" It might be argued that this property\nis part of what we mean by \" causal connection \".\nWe have described property a in abstract terms, so perhaps an illustra-\ntion will be helpful. Consider, for example, the group of wireless receivers\nwhich are tuned to a given wavelength for a given period : in the vicinity\nof each receiver will be occurring processes which are qualitatively and\nstructurally similar, e.g. the sound of a certain symphony. If an observer\ncould ascertain the (virtually) simultaneous occurrence of these processes,\nhe would conclude, even if he were completely ignorant of the modus\noperandi of wireless transmission, that they were causally connected. If\nhe could also ascertain the spatial (or spatio-temporal) centre of this group\nof processes, he would conclude that their causal source was some process\noccurring in this region. Now there is a criterion which would enable an\nobserver to locate this central region (I am assuming, for simplicity, that\nthere are no relay stations). Even if we ignore the fact that the further\nyou go from the centre, the later the signals arrive (and our observer could\nonly detect this fact if he were an accomplished and well-equipped\nexperimenter!) : nevertheless, our observer could discover a spatial\nclustering in respect of the \" volume \" or loudness of the sounds, that is\nto say, he could discover the fact that the further one moves in any direc-\ntion from what is the location of the transmitter, the weaker, ceteris paribus,\nis the volume.\nTo return to Carington's results\u2014these reveal a property which is very\nsimilar to, though not identical with, property a, namelv property \/3 (as\nwe shall call it), viz. \" a purely temporal clustering, around a central event\nor process, of a set of events or processes which are, structurally and\/or\nqualitatively, similar to each other \". The clustering in question is not\nspatial, for Carington found that the spatial relations between the bodies\nof the various percipients and of the experimenter are completely irrelevant,\nand this irrelevance of spatial relations is confirmed by other experiments\nin ESP. Surely property \/3, just as much as property a, is a criterion of\ncausal connection. It has not hitherto been recognised as such, and it is\ncertainly not part of what we have hitherto meant by \" causal connection \",\nfor prior to Carington's experiments we had never come across any\ninstance of property \/3.\nIf this is granted, we may now point out that the facts which revealed\nproperty \/3 furnish us with a criterion of the direction of causal influence,\nother than the common-sense criterion (that this influence is always froin\nearlier to later events). There are characteristics in Carington's data\nanalogous to the fading of volume as we move further in any direction\nfrom the broadcasting transmitter : for we find the \" hits \" dwindling as\nthe temporal distance from the occasion of display increases, and we find\n\f78 C. W. K. Mimdle [Part 178]\nthat this dwindling occurs in both temporal directions\u2014before and after\n\u2014\nin a symmetrical manner. We may notice, in passing, that Carington's\nmethod of scoring was designed to enable us to apply a single numerical\nmeasure to numbers of hits and accuracy of hits. If it were possible to\nassess these factors separately, we might find two distinct criteria of the\ndirection of causal influence if the dwindling, in both temporal directions,\napplies both to numbers of hits, and to the degree of resemblance of hits\nto the original. We could find an analogy for this in our broadcasting\nillustration, in that as distance from the transmitter increases, not only\ndoes volume decline, but distortion tends to increase. However, we must\nnot press our analogy too far, for it is in many respects imperfect. The\nconclusions I wish to emphasise are that if we accept property j8 as a\ncriterion of causal connection\n(i) we can find at least one criterion of the direction of causal influence\nwhich is independent of the common-sense criterion ;\n(ii) we must regard Carington's results as indicating precognition, that\nis to say, must conclude that some of the extra-chance \" hits \",\nwhich were drawn before the display of the original drawing,\nwere causally influenced, in the manner defined earlier, by the\ndrawing or display of the original.\nMy tentative conclusion is that our evidence that PK and precognition\nare independent phenomena will become very formidable, if not con-\nclusive, if and when we have {a) obtained results similar to Carington's\nin similar experiments using larger numbers of percipients, and {b)\neliminated hypotheses i and 2 in PK experiments.\nIt seems necessary to apply very strict standards when trying to isolate\nPK and precognition, since we must surely accept what Driesch stated^\nas our first methodological principle\n\u2014\" no phenomenon may be admitted\nas fundamental if it can be in any way reduced to another, or represented\nas only a variant of it \". If a hypothesis, e.g. that precognition occurs\n(or e.g. that PK occurs), can be established by a single unambiguous\nexperiment, this will contribute an immense increment to the probability\nthat other facts which can be most simply explained by the same hypo-\nthesis are correctly so explained, even if other more complicated\nexplanations of these facts are also possible. Whether hypothesis 3 can\nbe plausibly applied to the spontaneous cases of ostensible precognition is\nanother story. I hope that someone more familiar with those cases will\nexamine this question. In concluding, I wish to record my debt to\nProfessor Price, Dr Soal and Dr Thouless for many helpful suggestions,\nwithout which this paper would have been very much more inadequate\nand incomplete.\n'Hans Driesch, Psychical Research, Bell & Sons, 1933, p. 110.\n\fIMMANUEL KANT AND PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nBy C. D. Broad\nPart I\nHistorical\nIt is plain that at a certain period of his life, viz. in the sixth decade of the\neighteenth century, Kant became interested in the experiences and specu-\nlations of another Immanuel, the Swedish seer Swedenborg. At that time\nKant was about 40 years old. He had begun to lecture as privat dozent\nin the university of Konigsberg in 1755 or 1756, and he did not become\nprofessor until 1770. He had already thought and written much about\nphysics, astronomy, and geography, and had devoted himself to the old-\nfashioned metaphysics in which he had been brought up. But the system\nof \" Critical Philosophy \", for which he was to become world-famous, was\nstill in the future. The first sketch of it is contained in his inaugural\ndissertation on becoming professor in 1770.\nSwedenborg was 72 in 1760. The only work of his to which Kant\nrefers is the Arcana Coehslia. This had been published anonymously in\nLondon by John Lewis of Paternoster Row in eight large quarto volumes\nfrom 1749 to 1756. According to Signe Toksvig, Swedenborg's recent\nbiographer, the authorship was first acknowledged in 1768. Presumably\nit had been an open secret for some time ; for Kant, in a work published\nin 1766, takes it for granted that Swedenborg is the author, and makes no\nsuggestion that the Arcana Coelestia was anonymous.\nSo far as I am aware, there are two and only two known writings of Kant\nwhich are concerned with Swedenborg and his doctrines. One is a letter\nto Miss Charlotte von Knobloch, the other is a book entitled Trdiimc eines\nGeistersehers erldutert durch die Trdume der Metaphysik. The \" Geister-\nseher \" is Swedenborg. The letter contains about 1900 words, the book\nabout 20,000. Kant lacked the art of condensation ; he was, to put it\nplainly, terribly long-winded. The letter abounds in stilted compliments,\nand the book in elephantine badinage.\n(i) Questions of dating. The book was published anonymously in\nKonigsberg and in the same year in Riga by another publisher. There is\nno doubt that the date of publication was 1766. But there is a serious\nmuddle about the date of the letter, which I will now briefly consider.\nThe letter appears to have been first published by Kant's biographer\nBorowski, and it was alleged to be dated \" Konigsberg, 10 August, 1758 \".\nIt is printed with that date in Vol. II of Hartenstein's edition of Kant's\nworks. But, unless Kant was an even more remarkable seer than Sweden-\nborg himself, this date is impossibly early. Hartenstein's attention was\ncalled to the point, and in the preface to Vol. Ill he discusses the question\nof the correct date. He quotes arguments by Kuno Fischer and Ueberweg\nwhich seems to show conclusively that it must have been 1763.\n79\n\f8o C. D. Broad [Part\nWe need not go into elaborate detail, but the following fact suffices to\nmake any date earlier than 1762 impossible. Kant refers in the letter to an\nincident in which Swedenborg seemed to show supernormal knowledge\nof a matter private to a certain princess in Stockholm. There is no doubt\nthat this lady was Lovisa Ulrika, sister to Frederic the Great and wife to\nking Adolf Fridrik of Sweden. Now in his book, in which he also refers\nto this incident, Kant says that it happened late in 1761. This statement\nhas been confirmed by the fact, which came to light many years later, that\nthe Swedish courtier, Count Tessin, recorded the incident in his diary on\nNov. 1 8th 1 76 1 as having happened three days earlier. (My authority\nfor this is Signe Toksvig's book.) It is plain, then, that news of it cannot\nhave reached East Prussia much, if at all, before the beginning of 1762.\nMoreover, in his letter to Miss von Knobloch, Kant says that he had\nlearned the story from a friend, that they had corresponded about it, and\nthat he had instituted various enquiries. All this would plainly take some\ntime.\nI think that we may accept the arguments of Fischer and Ueberweg to\nshow that the letter to Miss von Knobloch cannot have been written\nbefore 1763. Hartenstein states and adduces evidence that she married\nin July 1764 and became Frau von Klingsporr. Now Kant addresses her\nin the letter as \" gnddiges Frdidein \", which would have been absurd if she\nhad been married at the time. So we may take it that the letter was\nwritten some time in 1763, i.e., about three years before the publication\nof the book.\nWe do not know precisely when the book was written, but I think that\nit is certain that it was written after the letter. In the letter there is no\nsuggestion that Kant has read any of Swedenborg's writings. He says that\nhe is eagerly awaiting the appearance of the book which Swedenborg is\nabout to publish in London, and that he has made arrangements to get it\nas soon as it leaves the press. Now it is certain that Kant had carefully\nread Swedenborg's Arcana Coelestia before writing Traume eines Geister-\nsehers. So it is reasonable to conclude that he wrote the latter book some\ntime after 1763 and some time before 1766.\nI have gone in some detail into the question of the relative dates of\nwriting the letter and the book, for the following reason. Where the\ncontents of the two overlap they seem to express a very different attitude\ntowards Swedenborg and his alleged supernormal gifts and achievements.\nThe letter is rather strongly favourable, whilst the book is completely\nagnostic in its conclusions and decidely sneering and condescending in\ntone. In view of the fact that the book must have been written after, and\ncannot have been written long after, the letter, this contrast is of some\ninterest.\nI will now give a general account of the contents of the two writings.\n(2) The Letter. It is plain that Miss von Knobloch had written to\nKant some time before, to ask his opinion about a story which she had\nheard concerning a certain display of ostensibly supernormal knowledge\non Swedenborg's part. It is evident from the context that the story\nconcerns queen Lovisa Ulrika's letter to one of her brothers, and it will\nbe as well at this point to give an account of the events from indepen-\ndent Swedish sources which were not available to Kant or to Miss von\n\f1 78] Iiiiiiiautiel Kant and PsycJiical Research 81\nKnobloeh. In what follows I base my statements on Signe Toksvig's book\non Swedenborg.\nCount Tessin, a Swedish nobleman connected with the court at Stock-\nholm, kept a diary, which has since been published. On November 18th\n1 76 1 he made an entry to the following effect. A story had been going\naround Stockholm concerning a recent feat of ostensible clairvoyance\nperformed by Swedenborg with reference to the queen. Tessin asked\nSwedenborg for the details on November i8th. Swedenborg thereupon\ngave the following account to Tessin. About three weeks earlier he had\nhad a conversation with the king and queen, and had told them of some of\nhis experiences in confirmation of his theories. The queen asked him\njokingly to try to bring her a message from her dead brother (the late\nPrince of Prussia), if he should happen to meet him in the spirit- world.\nOn the Sunday before November i8th Swedenborg again presented\nhimself at the palace and asked for an audience with the queen. He then\ntold her something privately, which he had been enjoined not to mention\nto anyone else. The queen was much moved, and exclaimed :\n\" That is\nsomething which no-one could have told except my brother!\" On his\nway out, Swedenborg said, he met Councillor von Dalin and asked him to\ninform the queen that he would try to follow up the matter further for her.\nSo far Swedenborg's story to Tessin. He added that the queen had\nhad a great shock, and that he would not venture to disturb her again\nuntil at least ten or twelve days had gone by.\nTessin, on his own account, states that the queen's consternation at\nSwedenborg's message is testified by all who were present. He mentions\nin particular Councillor Baron von Scheflier. He adds that the queen's\naccount of the incident tallies with Swedenborg's, and that she has herself\nput Swedenborg to a new test. It should be mentioned that there is no\nevidence that Swedenborg ever did approach her again on this topic. It\nis, however, alleged (on what evidence I do not know) that, whenever she\nwas asked about the incident in later life, she either acknowledged the\ntruth of the story or changed the subject in an embarrassed way.\nSigne Toksvig states that, after the queen's death, Count A. J. von\nHopken, a Swedish statesman and friend of Swedenborg's, wrote an\naccount of the incident. It appears from what he says that the queen had\nbeen carrying on a secret correspondence with this brother, notwith-\nstanding that Sweden and Prussia were at war with each other at the time.\nHopken's story is that the message which Swedenborg delivered referred\nto the last letter written by the queen to her brother before his death.\nSwedenborg, who claimed to have made contact with the spirit of the\ndeceased prince, conveyed an apology from him for not having answered\nthe letter and an appropriate reply to it. According to von Hopken, the\nqueen said :\n\" No-one but God knows this secret!\n\"\nWe can now return to Kant and Miss von Knobloeh. Kant begins by\napologizing for his delay in answering her enquiry. He says that he\nthought it desirable to investigate the matter further before writing. He\nstates that he is by no means inclined to accept such stories lightly. He\nthinks that it is a sound rule to take a negative attitude towards even\nthe best-attested of them. He does not indeed deny the possibility of\nsuch alleged facts, for we know so little about the nature of a spirit, if\n\f82 C. D. Bi nad [Part\nsuch there be. But he thinks that, taken as a whole, such stories are not\nadequately attested. Then, again, the alleged phenomena are so un-\nintelligible, and, even if genuine, so useless, that it is hard to accept\nthem. Lastly, there are so many instances of proved fraud and credulity.\nKant sums up this part of his letter by saying that, until he became\nacquainted with the stories about Swedenborg's feats, his attitude towards\nalleged supernormal phenomena was completely negative.\nHe then proceeds to tell how he was brought in touch with these stories,\nand how he tried to investigate them.\n(i) The Queen s Letter. This incident was first brought to Kant's\nnotice by a Danish officer, a friend of his who had formerly attended his\nlectures. The account given by this Danish officer to Kant was as follows.\n(I shall add explanatory historical notes in square brackets. They are\nbased on statements in the preface to Vol. Ill of Hartenstein's edition of\nKant's works.)\nThe Austrian ambassador in Copenhagen, Dietrichstein [who held\noffice from 1756 to 1763], received a letter from Baron von Liitzow, the\nambassador from Mecklenburgh to the court of Stockholm. In this letter\nvon Liitzow stated that he, together with the Dutch ambassador to\nStockholm, had been present at what Kant calls \" the curious history\nwhich you \" (Miss von Knobloch) \" have already heard concerning\nSwedenborg \". (I take this to mean that the two ambassadors had been\npresent at the queen's reception when Swedenborg made his communica-\ntion to her.) Dietrichstein in Copenhagen had either read or shown this\nletter to the Danish officer and other guests at a party.\nKant says that he thought it unlikely that one ambassador would send\nto another a false account of an incident concerning the sovereign to\nwhose court he was attached, and would moreover send it in a letter\nintended to be communicated to others. He therefore wrote to the Danish\nofficer and made further enquiries of him.\nThe officer said in his answer that he had again spoken to Dietrichstein\non the matter, that the facts really were as stated, and moveover that\nProfessor Schlegel had assured him that there was no possibility of doubt.\n(I do not know what weight, if any, is to be attached to this confirmation\nby Schlegel. It must be regretfully admitted that \" what the Professor\nsaid \" is not, as such, evidence.) The officer added that he was about to\ndepart to the army under General St. Germain, and he advised Kant to\nwrite directly to Swedenborg. [St. Germain became a Danish field-\nmarshal in 1760. The Danish army was mobilized in 1762 to meet a\nthreatened attack by the czar Peter III.] Kant accordingly wrote to\nSwedenborg, and the letter was handed in by an English merchant in\nStockholm. Swedenborg had received the letter favourably and had\npromised to answer it, but no answer had as yet come.\nSo much for the Danish officer. In the meanwhile Kant had made the\nacquaintance of a certain Englishman who had been in Konigsberg in the\nsummer before the date of writing. Kant describes him as \" a fine man \",\nsays that he had become very friendly with him, and obviously has great\nconfidence in him. This Englishman was about to visit Sweden, and\nKant asked him to go into the whole question of Swedenborg's alleged\nmarvels while there. (Signe Toksvig seems to assume without question\n\f178] ImmamieJ Kant and Psvchical Rcscarcli 83\nthat this man ^vas Kant's great friend, the EngHsh merchant Green. I do\nnot know it there is any evidence for this. No name is given to him in the\nletter.)\nThe EngHshman did as Kant had asked him and wrote to Kant several\nletters describing his investigations and impressions. In his first letter\nhe said that the statements of all the most distinguished persons in Stock-\nholm supported the story about Swedenborg and the queen. He had not\nyet met Swedenborg, but hoped to do so shortly. He found it hard to\nbelieve the stories which highly sensible persons in Stockholm were telling\nabout Swedenborg's intercourse with the unseen world.\nIn later letters the Englishman said that he had met Swedenborg and\nhad been in his house. He describes the seer as a pleasant open-hearted\nman and a scholar. Swedenborg told him that God had given him the\npower to communicate at will with departed spirits, and he appealed to\nquite notorious evidence in support of this. When reminded of Kant's\nletter to him, Swedenborg said that he had received it. He was going to\nLondon in the May of that year and would there publish a book in which\na complete answer to Kant's questions would be found. (According to\nSigne Toksvig, Swedenborg visited Amsterdam in 1762 and again in 1763.\nHe was in England on a short visit in 1763, during which he delivered\ncopies of his printed books to the Royal Society. But he did not visit\nEngland in 1762 and he published no such book as he had spoken of to\nthe Englishman.)\nKant then proceeds to relate, on the evidence of his English friend, two\nother stories of ostensibly supernormal cognition on Swedenborg's part.\nThese are the incidents of the lost receipt for Mme de Marteville's silver\ntea-service and of the fire on Sodermalm in Stockholm. They are well\nknown and often quoted ;\nbut, so far as I am aware, there is no extant\nevidence for them except this letter of Kant's, quoting statements from\nletters of his unnamed English correspondent. Kant says in his letter to\nMiss von Knobloch that \" the whole living public \" is witness to these\nevents, and that his friend, who relates the stories, \" has been able to\ninvestigate them on the spot \". I will now reproduce Kant's account of\nthese two incidents as reported by his English correspondent.\n(ii) The lost Receipt. M. de Marteville was ambassador from Holland\nat the court of Stockholm. [He died April 25th, 1760.] Some time after\nhis death the goldsmith Croon demanded from the widow payment for a\nsilver service which her late husband had bought of him and which had\nbeen duly delivered. She was convinced that the bill had been paid ;\nbut she could not find the receipt, and was in considerable distress, as the\nsum was a large one. She invited Swedenborg to call, explained the\ncircumstances to him, and asked him to try to get in touch with the spirit\nof her husband. Three days later Swedenborg called on Mme de Marte-\nville at a time when she had company to coffee. He said that the receipt\nwas in a certain bureau upstairs. She answered that this was certainly a\nmistake, for that bureau had been cleared out and thoroughly searched\nand the receipt was not among its contents. Swedenborg answered that,\nif she would pull out the left-hand drawer, she would notice a certain\nboard. If this were pulled out, a secret compartment would be disclosed,\ncontaining not only the receipt but also the late ambassador's private\n\f84 C. D. Broad [Part\nDutch correspondence. The whole company adjourned to the room, the\ndrawer was opened, and everything was found as Swedenborg had foretold.\nTwo points are worth mentioning. In the letter the name of the\nambassador is given as Harteville, but in the book it is given correctly\nas Mai teville. The second point is that, if the incident happened at all,\nit must have done so in the latter part of 1760. If the correct date of Kant's\nletter is 1763, his friend was presumably in Stockholm some time in 1762.\nSo about two years would have elapsed between the incident itself and the\nEnglishman's enquiries about it.\n(iii) The Stockholm Fire. Kant says that this story seems to him to have\nthe greatest probative force of them all, and that it is free from all possible\ndoubt. He gives the date as \" towards the end of September 1756 \".\nDates seem not to have been Kant's strong point, for in Trdume eines\nGeistersehers he assigns it\n\" towards the end of 1759 \". Hartenstein gives\nthe date of the fire as July 19 1759, and quotes as his authority P. 77 of\nPart 121 of a German periodical called Neue genealogische-historische\nNachrichten for 1760. It would be worth while, if it has not already been\ndone, for some Swedish investigator to enquire whether there is any\ncontemporary account of the alleged incident in public or private records\neither in Stockholm or in Goteborg. It should be remarked that serious\nfires were very common in Swedish towns, which were largely built of\nwood, and that presumably Stockholm was no exception. It should also\nbe noted that the distance between Goteborg and Stockholm is about\n285 miles by the present main-line railway.\nThe story in Kant's letter is as follows. Swedenborg landed at Goteborg\nfrom England at 4 p.m. on a certain Saturday. He was invited by a Mr\nWm. Castell to dine at the latter's house with a party of fifteen persons.\nAt about 6 p.m. Swedenborg left the company for a short while and\nreturned looking pale and alarmed. He said that a dangerous fire had\nbroken out on Sodermalm in Stockholm, where his own house stood.\nHe was restless and went out several times. He said that the house of a\ncertain friend, whom he named, was already in ashes, and that his own\nwas in danger. At 8 p.m. he again came in after a short absence and said\nthat the fire had been quenched at the third door from his house. These\nstatements of Swedenborg's were reported the same evening to the\nGovernor of Goteborg. Next morning, i.e., Sunday, the Governor inter-\nviewed Swedenborg, who described the fire in some detail and said how\nit had begun and how long it had lasted. On the Monday evening came a\nmessenger, who had left Stockholm on the Saturday while the fire was\ngoing on. He brought letters with him, in which the fire was described\nin a way which tallied with Swedenborg's statements. On the Tuesday\nmorning the royal courier from Stockholm arrived at the Governor's\nhouse with a precise account of the damage and a statement that the fire\nhad been put out at 8 p.m. on the Saturday.\nKant says that his English friend has investigated all this, not only in\nStockholm, but also during a stay of about two months in Goteborg, where\nhe is acquainted with the chief business houses. Kant adds that, in the\nshort time which has elapsed since 1756, most of the eye-witnesses are\nstill alive. (If the correct date is 1759, the time-lapse is considerably\nshorter, for the linglish friend was presumably in Sweden in 1762.)\n\f178] Immanuel Kant and Psychical Research 85\nKant ends his letter to Miss von Knobloch by mentioning that his\nEngHsh friend has told him something of Swedenborg's accounts of his\nintercourse with the spirits of the dead and of conditions in the spirit-\nworld. Kant says that he wishes that he could himself have interrogated\nSwedenborg on these matters, because his English friend is not skilled\nin framing and putting those questions which would throw most light on\nessential points.\n(3) Trdume eines Geistersehers. We can now leave the letter and con-\nsider the book. This is a very curious production in itself. Moreover,\na comparison of it with the letter raises interesting, but perhaps insoluble,\nquestions about Kant's motives for writing it at all, for publishing it\nanonymously, and for adopting towards the subject in general and Sweden-\nborg in particular the bantering contemptuous attitude which he does\nadopt.\nThe book begins with a preface, and the rest of it is divided into two\nParts. Part I, which is subdivided into four Sections, may be described\nas an able and elaborate general discussion of the philosophical problems\ninvolved in the notion of a disembodied spirit, of a world of such spirits,\nand of the relations of body and soul in human individuals, and in claims\nby certain men to be in touch with the inhabitants of the spirit-world.\nIt is not directly concerned with Swedenborg or his experiences. Part II\nis subdivided into three Sections. The first of these repeats the three\nstories of Swedenborg's alleged feats of ostensibly supernormal cognition\nwhich were discussed in the letter. The second Section contains an\nelaborate account of the doctrine as to the nature and laws of the spirit-\nworld which Swedenborg professed to have derived by personal observa-\ntion and from conversations with spirits. This account is based upon the\ncontents of the eight quarto volumes of Arcana Coelestia, which Kant had\nbought and evidently studied carefully. So far as I can judge, Kant's\nsynopsis of Swedenborg's main doctrines is adequate, accurate, and clear.\nThe third Section is entitled Practical Conclusion of the Whole Treatise.\nThe practical conclusion is, roughly, that we should cultivate our gardens,\nand not waste our time with either what metaphysics or what self-styled\nmediums claim to tell us about the spirit-world. Speculation about that\nworld is fruitless. It can give no support to genuine morality, whilst, on\nthe other hand, any morally good man feels assured of human survival\nwithout recourse either to metaphysics or to alleged mediumistic evidence.\nI will now consider in somewhat greater detail the part of the book\nwhich covers the same ground as the letter, viz. Part II Section I. In the\nletter, as we have seen, the story of queen Lovisa Ulrika's interview with\nSwedenborg about her brother is told on the authority of the Danish\nofficer reporting a letter from von Liitzow in Stockholm to Dietrichstein\nin Copenhagen. The other stories are told on the authority of the English-\nman, who has interviewed Swedenborg and investigated the evidence for\nthe tales of his exploits at Kant's special request. The impression which\none gets from the letter is that Kant was satisfied with the evidence, at any\nrate as regards the Stockholm fire.\nIn Part II Section I of the book Kant introduces the topic by saying\nthat \" the whole question is neither important enough nor sufficiently\nwell prepared to enable one to come to any decision about it \", and that\n\f86 C. D. Broad [Part\nhe presents these stories \" with complete indifference to the favourable\nor unfavourable judgment of the reader \".\nAs regards the story about queen Lovisa Ulrika, he does not mention\nher by name, but speaks of her as \" a princess . . . whose great intelligence\nand insight would make it almost impossible that she should be deceived\nin such matters \". The authority for the story is stated to be a letter from\nan ambassador at her court to another ambassador in Copenhagen. Kant\nadds that the story agrees with what has been elicited in answer to special\nenquiries. There is no mention of the Danish officer, but Kant is no\ndoubt referring to his correspondence with him.\nThe story about the missing receipt is now correctly referred to Mme\nde Marteville instead of Harteville. Kant now says that this tale \" has no\nother testimony than common report, which is very inadequate proof \".\nAs regards the story of the Stockholm fire, Kant says that it is \" of a\nkind which could very easily be completely proved or disproved \". At\nthe end of this Section, after a great deal of palaver, he says that it would\nbe worth while for anyone, who had money enough and nothing better\nto do, to go and investigate these and similar stories at first hand. He\ngives no hint that a friend of his, of whom he has a very high opinion,\nhas personally investigated the evidence for the story of the Stockholm\nfire both in Stockholm and Goteborg ; that this friend was persuaded of\nits truth ; and that Kant himself, in a recent letter dealing expressly with\nthis topic, had described the story as free from all possible doubt. In fact\nthe Englishman, who first brought the second and third of the stories to\nKant's notice, and who had investigated the whole question of Sweden-\nborg's alleged supernormal feats at Kant's special request, is never\nmentioned in the book. Kant does indeed admit, in the Preface, that he\nhimself has made some investigations into the truth of such stories. But\nhe almost apologizes for having done so, and he asserts that he \" found\n\u2014\nas is usual where there is nothing to seek\u2014nothing \".\nTowards the end of Part I Section IV Kant says that he would not\nventure to deny all truth in such stories. He doubts each severally, but is\ninclined to give some credence to them taken collectively. He remains\n\" serious and undecided \" in view of them. Nevertheless, he ends this\nSection by saying that for the future he will \" abandon investigations which\nare altogether in vain \". (This remark, in view of its place in the book,\nmay refer rather to the metaphysical speculations about spirits in Part I\nthan to the alleged empirical evidence in Part II.) Towards the end of his\nsynopsis of Swedenborg's teachings about the nature and laws of the\nspirit-world (Part II Section II) Kant says that one might be inclined to\nattach some weight to his unverifiable statements about the next world, if\nand only if one could appeal to testable instances of alleged supernormal\nknowledge by him, and if one were to find that they are supported by\nHving witnesses. \" But \", Kant adds, \" this one never finds \". How this\nlast remark is to be reconciled with statements which I have quoted from\nKant's letter to Miss von Knobloch, I do not profess to conjecture.\nAt this point we may well ask ourselves what Kant's motives could have\nbeen for writing and publishing Trdiime eines Geistersehers. In the Preface\nhe gives two reasons. One is that he wrote the book at the instigation of\nfriends, known and unknown. Towards the end of Part II Section II he\n\f178] Immanuel Kant and Psychical Research 87\nrepeats that he was put on to this thankless task through the importunities\nof idle and curious friends. From their point of view the enquiry has led\nto nothing and has been mere waste of time. The second reason which he\ngives in the Preface is that he had bought and read through a big book, viz.\nSwedenborg's Arcana Coelestia, and did not want all his work to be wasted.\nEarly in Part II Section II he describes this book as consisting of \" eight\nquarto volumes of nonsense \". Later in the same Section he remarks that\nhe has saved the curious reader from spending jCj sterling in satisfying a\nlittle idle curiosity.\nObviously these cannot have been Kant's main motives. He was not at\nall a wealthy man and he was a very busy one. It is most unlikely that\nhe would have spent \u00a3y on the Arcana Coelestia and then ploughed\nthrough it and given a careful synopsis of its teachings about the spirit-\nworld merely to satisfy the idle curiosity of some or to save the pockets of\nothers. We must remember the statement in the letter to Miss von\nKnobloch that he is impatiently awaiting the book which Swedenborg is\nabout to publish in London and that he has made arrangements to get it as\nsoon as it leaves the press.\nI would suggest very tentatively that what may have happened is this.\nInstead of getting the book which he was expecting, viz., an account by\nSwedenborg of those of his ostensibly supernormal cognitions which were\nopen to verification in this world, together with adequate testimony for\nthem, he was landed with the eight volumes of the Arcana Coelestia.\nThis is largely occupied with an elaborate symbolic interpretation of every\nword and sentence in the books of Genesis and Exodus. It may fairly be\ndescribed as one of the most boring and absurd productions of any human\npen. After reading it Kant may well have been inclined to dismiss with\ncontemptuous impatience the alleged supernormal feats of a person who\ncould devote a large part of his life to writing such stuflF, and to ignore the\nfact that he himself had very recently been fully persuaded of the veridical\nnature of some of them, through the testimony of the Danish officer and\nthe English friend. It was as if one had heard on very good evidence that\nMr. X had made certain bold but highly ingenious emendations to difficult\npassages in classical texts, and had then found that he was a British\nIsraelite whose published works were mainly devoted to proving, by help\nof measurements on the Great Pyramid, that the earth is flat and that\nBacon wrote all the works commonly attributed to Shakespeare. If Kant\ncould have picked up Swedenborg's De Coelo et Inferno, a single volume\npublished in London in 1758, he would not indeed have got what he was\nexpecting, but he would have found a tolerably succinct account of\nSwedenborg's doctrine of the spirit-world, and would have been saved\nmuch time and money and justifiable irritation.\nHowever this may be, Kant says explicitly that he had a different end\nin view from that of the friends whose idle curiosity set him upon writing\nthe book. His subject is metaphysics. That science has two functions.\nOne is to try to answer the questions which enquiring minds raise when\nthey seek to investigate by reason the more deeply hidden properties of\nthings. The other is to consider whether such questions are concerned\nwith anything that we can possibly know, and to see what relation they bear\nto our empirical concepts, on which all our judgments must ultimately\n\f88 C. D. Broad [Part\nbe founded. The essential service which it renders in its second capacity\nis to show that we must keep within the bounds of ordinary sense-\nperception and ordinary reasoning. The upshot of the book is to rein-\nforce that conclusion in reference to claims, such as Swedenborg's, to\nempirical knowledge beyond those limits.\nLastly, we might raise the question : Why did Kant publish the book\nanonymously.' If there had been a good chance of the anonymity being\npreserved, one could think of excellent reasons. Kant no doubt wished to\nkeep a good reputation as a level-headed burgher, scholar, scientist, and\nphilosopher, and not to incur the contempt of his colleagues and fellow-\ntownsmen or to prejudice his chances of eventual election to a professor-\nship. Even in England and the U.S.A. to-day an acknowledged addiction\nto even the most respectable branches of psychical research would probably\nbe somewhat detrimental to the professional prospects of a young biologist\nand still more to those of a young psychologist. In Sweden, unless I am\nmuch mistaken, it would still be almost fatal to one's chances of a pro-\nfessorship in many subjects. It is reasonable to suspect that, in \" en-\nlightened \" academic circles in East Prussia in the middle of the eighteenth\ncentury, a reputation for having carefully read Swedenborg's writings and\nhaving paid serious attention to the evidence for his alleged feats of\nclairvoyance, would be enough to condemn a privat dozent to remain in\nthat position for the rest of his life.\nBut could Kant possibly have hoped to preserve his anonymity? This\nseems to me almost incredible. I should have thought that the style of\nthe book as a whole and the contents of the philosophical part of it would\nhave betrayed the authorship to colleagues in Konigsberg almost at once.\nMoreover, the \" idle and curious friends \", who had urged Kant to make a\nstudy of Swedenborg, could hardly have felt any doubt as to the authorship\nof an anonymous book on the subject in which they are explicitly referred\nto, and they could hardly be relied upon to keep their suspicions to\nthemselves. I can only suggest that the conventions of the time and place\npermitted a privat dozent to flirt with this disreputable subject, provided\nthat he made an honest man of himself by maintaining theform of anonymity\nand by adopting a sufficiently bantering and condescending tone towards\nthe alleged phenomena and the persons of whom they were narrated. If\nthese were the conditions, Kant certainly complied with them.\nPart II\nTheoretical\nI shall now consider Kant's philosophical discussion of the problems\nraised by Swedenborg's theories and claims. It seems to me that it is of\nsome interest to do this. We have at our disposal nowadays much more\nvaried, better attested, and more carefully investigated data than Kant had,\nbut there has been very little discussion by first-rate philosophers of their\ntheoretical implications. Kant was certainly one of the greatest philo-\nsophers of all time ; he combined to an extraordinary degree critical\nacumen and constructive fertility and originality. He had also a most\nremarkable capacity for \" sitting on the fence \" and stating the strong and\n\f178] Immanuel Kant and Psychical Research 89\nthe weak points of opposing concepts. This is very noticeable in his\ndiscussion of mechanism and vitalism in the Critique of Judgment, and it is\nalmost equally prominent in Trdume eines Geistersehers.\n(i) What is a Spirit? Kant begins by raising the question : What do\nwe understand by a \" spirit \"? We often use this word, so presumably it\nmeans something, even if it expresses only a fictitious idea.\nWe cannot have derived the notion of a spirit from instances of it which\nwe have ourselves observed, for we can use the word intelligibly even if\nwe doubt or deny that there are spirits. Kant remarks here that many of\nour notions, though not derived from specific experiences in the direct way\nin which, e.g., the notion of \" red \" or of \" man \" is derived, yet arise\non the occasion of certain experiences by a kind of unwitting inference.\nSuch notions may be called \" surreptitious \" (erschlichene). They may\nbe in part mere fictions of the imagination ; but they may be in part\napplicable to reality, for these unwitting inferences need not always be\nmistaken.\nIn order to understand Kant's attempted definition or description of a\n\" spirit \" it will be best to begin with a brief account of his doctrine of\nmatter.* For his account of spirits is developed in comparison and\ncontrast with the notion of matter. I shall state what I understand to be\nKant's view in my own way. He assumes that any finite body consists\nof a number of simple material substances. Each of these is, in a certain\nsense, located at some one geometrical point at each moment, though it may\nbe located at different points at different moments. He further assumes\nthat no two such substances can be located at the same geometrical point\nat one moment, though one of them may at a later moment be located at\nthe point at which another was located at an earlier moment.\nNow Kant equates the proposition that two simple material substances\ncannot be located at the same point at the same moment with the pro-\nposition that any such substance exerts upon any other a repulsive force,\nwhich increases rapidly as the distance between the points at which they\nare located is diminished beyond a certain critical amount, and which\nwould become infinite if this were reduced to zero. He points out that,\nalthough a simple material substance is indivisible and is in one sense\nlocated at a point, yet there is an important sense in which it occupies a\nfinite volume. This is obvious enough. I have so far talked of a puncti-\nform element of matter located at a point and surrounded by a certain\nfield of repulsive force. But one could more properly identify the elemen-\ntary material substance with this field, and say that it is present with more\nor less intensity at any point within the sphere in which the repulsive\nforce is appreciable. The essential fact is that there is a field of repulsive\nforce which is at each moment symmetrical in all directions about a certain\nsingular point at which it is infinite. If one identifies the elementary\nsubstance with this symmetrical field of force, then one can say that it\nis located at any moment at the centre of this field, and one can say that it\ndynamically occupies at any moment, with systematically different degrees\nof intensity, every point within a small sphere around that centre.\nKant remarks that all this is consistent with the statement that a simple\n* A theory on the same lines was worked out in considerable detail by Boscovich\nand published in 1763 at Venice.\n\fC. D. Broad [Part\nelement of matter is unextended. To say that a thing is extended implies\nthat it would be significant to say that it would occupy a volume even if\nnothing but it had existed. But the field of repulsive force associated with\na single element of matter is a mere fiction unless there is at least one other\nelement of matter. Repulsion in accordance with a certain law of variation\nwith distance is meaningless unless we conceive that there are at least two\nelementary substances to repel each other.\nIt should be remarked that Kant gives the following reason for associat-\ning a finite sphere of repulsive force with each simple element of matter.\nA continuous macroscopic body fills a finite volume, and Kant argues that\nany substance which is a genuine part of it must therefore occupy a\nvolume which bears a finite proportion to that which is occupied by the\nbody as a whole. Now a point is a Itinit in, not a part of, a volume. There-\nfore a continuous macroscopic body could not consist of elementary\nparticles which were punctiform and nothing more. I take it, therefore,\nthat his final theory is that a continuous macroscopic body is composed of a\nfiiiiie number of spherical fields of repulsive force, each centred around a\ndifferent point within the volume which the body fills, each having\nappreciable intensity only within quite a small radius, and each increasing\nrapidly towards infinite intensity as the distance from the centre decreases\ntowards zero.\nWe are now in a position to consider Kant's definition of a \" spirit \".\nIn view of the account just given of elementary material substances, it is\nplainly useless to define a spirit as a simple rational substance. For its\nsimplicity will not distinguish it from an elementary material substance.\nAnd the addition of \" rational \" will not help. For, Kant says, we know\nnothing about the internal properties of elementary material substances.\nSo far as we know, there is nothing to prevent such a substance being\nrational, though there is also nothing to suggest that any of them are so.\nAccordingly Kant adds two negative characteristics to distinguish a\nspirit from an elementary material substance. The first is that the\npresence of a spirit in a region of space would not involve any resistance\nto the entry of an elementary material substance into that region. The\nsecond is that, if we imagine each of the elementary material substances\nwhich together make up a finite continuous body to be replaced by a\nspiritual substance, the resulting aggregate would not be a body occupying\nthe volume occupied by the original body. The second feature evidently\nfollows from the first. If the volume were occupied after the change, in the\nway suggested, by a collection of spirits, there would be no reason why\nmatter from outside should not freely enter it ; since a spiritual substance\ndoes not oppose the entry of an elementary material substance into the\nregion which it occupies. But, on the other hand, to say that the region\nwas continuously occupied by a body after the change, would entail that\nmatter could not enter it from outside without either shifting the present\ncontents or encountering ever-increasing opposition if they could not be\nshifted.\nSo, in effect, Kant's proposed definition of a \" spirit \" is a rational\nsimple substance whose presence in a region of space does not offer any\nresistance to the simultaneous presence of an elementary material substance\nwithin that region. And an immediate consequence of this is that the\n\f178] Immanuel Kant and Psychical Research 91\npresence of any number of spirits within a region, however they might be\nlocated within it, would not eo ipso constitute a body continuously filling\nthat region.\n(2) Are there Spirits? The next question is whether there is anything\nanswering to this definition. Kant holds that philosophers have proved\nsatisfactorily that anything which thinks must be simple, and that the\nego of each one of us cannot be a whole composed of a plurality of inter-\nconnected substances. So each of us can be sure that his soul is a simple\nsubstance. But it does not follow that it is a spirit in the sense defined.\nFor there is nothing in these arguments to show that it would not oppose\nthe entry of any material substance into any region in which it was present.\nAnd so there is nothing to show that a suitable aggregate of human souls\nwould not constitute a finite continuous body.\nThe question now arises whether \" spirits \", in the sense defined, are\neven possible existents. I think that the essential points in Kant's argument\nmight be put as follows. The question comes to this. Is there any\ninconsistency in supposing that there might be simple substances which,\nlike elementary material substances, are or may be present in space in a\nsense which does not involve their being extended, but which, unlike them,\ndo not offer any resistance to the entry of elementary material substances\ninto the regions which they occupy?\nNow Kant distinguishes between cases where one has a positive rational\ninsight into the possibility of something, and other cases where one has no\nsuch insight and one's only ground for saying that so-and-so is possible\nis that experience provides us with actual instances of so-and-so. He does\nnot give any examples of the first alternative, but I think that it is quite\neasy to do so. One has rational insight into the fact that five and only five\nforms of regular solid are possible in Euclidean space, and that one of these\npossibilities is the regular icosahedron. One does not just find oneself\nforced to admit that the icosahedron is a possible form of regular solid\nbecause actual instances of such a solid have been observed. (It is in fact\nvery doubtful if instances existed until they were constructed by makers of\nmathematical models in order to illustrate the already recognized possi-\nbility.) On the other hand, one has no rational insight into the fact that\nblue is one of the possible colours ; one knows that it is so merely because\none has seen blue objects.\nKant argues that we have no rational insight into the possibility of the\nconnexion between being a simple substance and being located at a point\nin space and occupying a sphere around it with a field of repulsive force\nof a certain kind. We ascribe this punctual location and this sphere of\nrepulsive force to the elements of matter merely because of certain facts\nwhich we observe when we perceive and operate with matter in bulk.\nStill less do we perceive any necessary connexion between the various factors\nin the notion of an elementary material substance. As regards the concept\nof a spirit, we have no rational insight into either the possibility or the\nimpossibility of a simple substance occupying a region of space and yet not\nbeing located at the centre of a field of repulsive force. Thus, so far as\nregards rational insight into the possibility, impossibility, or necessity of\nthe combination of certain factors in a concept, the concept of a spirit is in\nprecisely the same position as that of a simple element of matter. We\n\f92 C. D. Broad [Part\nhave no such insight in either case. The only advantage enjoyed by the\nlatter over the former is that we have certain perceptual experiences which\nestablish its possibility by providing actual instances of it. Kant's con-\nclusion is that the possibility of \" spirits \", as defined by him, can never be\nrefuted. But there is no hope of ever getting rational insight into it, and,\nunlike the concept of simple material substances, its possibility can never\nbe established through instantiation by sense-perception.\n(3) The human Soul and its Body. As we have seen, Kant holds that,\nalthough it is certain that a human soul is a simple substance, it is by no\nmeans certain that it is a \" spirit \" in the sense defined. For, so far as we\ncan tell, it might be a simple material substance endowed with rationality.\nWe must now consider his further discussion of the embodied human soul.\nSuppose that the human soul were a spirit in the sense defined. Then\nthe question could be raised : What is its place in the material world?\nKant answers that the place occupied by the body which a person calls\nhis body would be the place occupied by his soul. Suppose that we then\nraise the question which would run in my terminology as follows : At\nwhat point within the place occupied by a person's body is his soul located?\nThen Kant suspects that the question is based on mistaken pre-supposi-\ntions. If I may put the matter in my own way, the mistake might be\nexpressed as follows. In the case of a simple element of matter one can\ndistinguish a certain geometrical point, within the region which it\ndynamically occupies, as the point at which it is located. One can do this\nbecause of the peculiar structure of the field of repulsive force which is\ncharacteristic of an elementary material substance. The peculiarity is that\nthe force falls off in intensity in all directions symmetrically from a certain\nsingular point at which it would be infinite. But a spirit has been defined\nas a simple substance which is fiot associated with a field of repulsive force\nof that kind. Yet, except on the assumption that it is so associated, the\nquestion : \"At what point is a spirit located within the region which it\ndynamically occupies? \" is meaningless.\nNow, so far as empirical facts go, Kant thinks that it would be reasonable\nto say that a person's soul is present equally at every place at which it\nwould be natural to locate any of his sensations. As he puts it : \"I feel\nthe painful pressure when my corn pains me, not in a nerve in my brain,\nbut at the end of my toe.\" In general, Kant holds that there is nothing\nin our experience to support the Cartesian view that the soul is located at a\ncertain point in the region occupied by the brain. He says that he knows\nof nothing which would refute the Scholastic doctrine that a person's soul\nis present as a whole in his body as a whole and in every part of it. This\nwould not make the soul extended. For its immediate presence through-\nout a whole volume would imply only a finite region of immediate action\nand passion, as in the case of a simple element of matter, and not a plurality\nof parts logically independent of each other.\nKant then proceeds to discuss the Cartesian view that the soul is located\nat a point within the region occupied by the brain. He asserts that the\nonly empirical evidence for this is that, after hard thinking, one is liable\nto feel characteristic sensations of stress and pressure in one's head. But\na similar argument, starting from other empirical facts, would locate the\nsoul in other parts of the body, e.g., in the heart or the diaphragm. Kant\n\f178] Immanuel Kant and Psychical Research 93\nsuggests that the reason why hard thinking is felt to take place in the head\nmay be the following. It always takes place by means of symbols, and\nthese are always visual or auditory images. Now visual and auditory\nsensations are specially connected with the head, because the eyes and ears\nare part of it ; and it is very likely that visual and auditory imagery\ninvolves the same, or nearly the same, parts of the brain as the corre-\nsponding kinds of sensation. For my own part I should have thought that\nthe grounds, whether they be good or bad, for the Cartesian view are\ncertain anatomical and pathological facts, which seem to show that the\nsensory nerves are transmissive conditions, without which stimuli that\naffect the peripheral parts of the body fail to produce sensations in the soul.\nKant holds that it is scarcely worth while to discuss direct arguments\nfor and against the Cartesian view of the location of the soul, because we\nknow so little of the soul's nature that any such arguments are inevitably\nvery weak. It is more profitable to consider certain implications of the\ntheory.\nHe thinks that the following would be one of them. On the Cartesian\nview the soul would not be distinguished from an elementary material\nsubstance by the way in which it is in space. Each could properly be\nsaid to be located at a point, though each would also be dynamically\npresent throughout a certain small volume surrounding that point. Now\nreason is a purely internal property, which we should not be able to\nperceive with our senses in elementary material substances even if they\npossessed it. There would therefore be no empirical objection to sup-\nposing that the simple elements of matter are all endowed with reason,\nand that a person's soul is just one such simple material substance among\nthe millions of others which together make up his body. Its outstanding\nposition would be due merely to the special situation which it occupies in\na certain natural machine (the body), viz., at the place where the con-\nnexions of neural paths enable its inner faculties of thinking and choosing\n(which it shares with all other elementary material substances) to affect\nand be affected by the outer world. If this were so, would not the most\nreasonable conclusion be that a human soul (which would be just a simple\nmaterial substance that has, by an extraordinary chance, come to occupy\nthis special position in an appropriate natural machine) would revert after\ndeath for the rest of eternity to its normal condition of a simple element\nof matter.?\nAnother consequence of the Cartesian view would be this. There would\nbe a certain one tiny bit of a person's brain, the removal of which would\nsuffice to de-animate him. Kant then points to the fact that there are\nplenty of cases where a man has lost a fair proportion of his brain without\nlosing his life or his power of thinking. He does not elaborate the argu-\nment ;\nand, as it stands, I do not think that it proves anything against the\nCartesian. Let us suppose, however, that it were true that for a certain\npart Pj of the brain there is an instance of a man who survived and con-\ntinued to think after that part, or a larger part containing it, had been\nremoved. Suppose that a similar proposition is true for parts Po,\nP3, . . . .P\u201e. Lastly, suppose that Pi, Po, -P,, together cover the whole\nof a human brain. (They might to some extent overlap each other ; the\nimportant point is that they should be collectively exhaustive, not that\n\f94 C. D. Broad [Part\nthey should be mutually exclusive.) Then, it seems to me, the Cartesian\ntheory would begin to look very shaky. But whether there is such a set of\nempirical facts, I do not know.\nSo much for Kant's reactions to the Cartesian doctrine. He confesses\nthat, as a matter of personal conviction, he is much inclined (i) to assert\nthe existence of spirits, in the sense defined, and (ii) to regard his soul as\nsuch a substance. He adds that, whatever reasons there may be for these\nconvictions, they apply equally to all living beings. It seems to Kant that\nthe essential peculiarity of a living organism is to be to a certain extent\nspontaneous and active from within, i.e., to have some power of deter-\nmining its own actions and modifying itself by something analogous to\nchoice in human beings.\nNow it is characteristic of inorganic matter that it occupies space by a\nnon-voluntary force which is limited by external counteraction. So it is\ndifficult to believe that living organisms would have the features of\nlimited self-determination and quasi-choice if they were composed entirely\nof elementary material substances. The upshot of the discussion is that\nKant thinks it likely that there is something analogous to a spiritual\nsubstance wherever there is a living organism, or at any rate an animal\norganism. We cannot possibly expect to have clear ideas of the various i\npossible grades of such little-understood entities as non-material simple\nsubstances. But at any rate we can distinguish those which are at the basis\nof the manifestations of purely animal life from those which include reason |\nas part of their spontaneous activity. Only the latter would properly be '\ncalled \" spirits \".\nIf a human soul is a spirit, then the connexion between it and the\norganism which it animates is a great mystery. On the one hand, it has\nto be conceived as forming, together with the body which it animates, a\nwhole of a peculiar kind, viz., a certain human individual. On the other\nhand, if the soul be a spirit, none of the well-known kinds of combination,\ne.g., that of the parts of an organism or of a crystal or of an artificial\nmachine, can be characteristic of this whole. How can a bodily substance\nact on a spirit, which, by hypothesis, offers no resistance to its entry into\nthe place which it occupies?\nKant says that it would seem necessary to suppose that a spirit acts i\non the simple elements of a body, not in respect of the external repulsive I\nforces by which such elements interact with each other, but directly in\nrespect of their inner states. It seems obvious to him that every substance\nmust have inner states and undergo a series of inner changes which are the\nfoundations of its external relations and their changes. Leibniz, as is well\nknown, held that these inner states are of the nature of perceptions. Kant\nsays that the numerous philosophers who have laughed at this theory may\nbe invited to say (i) whether they think that there could be substances with\nno internal states but only variable external relations to other substances,\nand (ii) if not, whether they can think of any better account of the inner\nstates, on which the external actions depend, than to say that they are\nanalogous to perceptions. To say that every simple element in a body has .\ninner states which are somewhat analogous to perceptions would not of\ncourse imply that the body as a whole has anything of the kind.\nThe upshot of Kant's discussion of this topic could perhaps be stated\n\f178] Imtnanuel Kant and Psychical Research 95\nas follows. A change in the inner state of material element A produces a\nchange in that of material element B only indirectly. It does so by being\ncorrelated with a change in the external field of force of A, which is\ncorrelated with a change in the external field of force of B, which is cor-\nrelated with a change in the inner state of B. But a change in the inner\nstate of a spiritual substance affects the inner state of the material elements\nof the body which it animates directly by a kind of telepathic rapport.\nA fortiori this must be the way in which one spiritual substance affects\nanother spiritual substance.\nKant says that he does not pretend to understand how a certain spirit\nand a certain body come to form one human individual at conception,\nnor how this union comes eventually to be dissolved on the occasion of\nfatal accident or disease.\n(4) The Spirit-world. We can now pass from Kant's discussion of the\nnature of a spiritual substance and the problems raised by embodied\nspirits to his discussion of the notion of a world of inter-related spirits.\nThe phenomena of inorganic matter can be explained satisfactorily in\nterms of extension, figure, motion, impenetrability, and various natural\nforces expressible in mathematical terms and subject to the laws of\nmechanics. But there are also living organisms in the world. As we have\nseen, Kant thinks that there must be substances of a special kind behind\nvital phenomena. These cannot be regarded as subject to the laws of\nmotion in general or impact in particular. On the contrary, they seem to\ngovern themselves and to organize non-living matter by their own inner\nactivity.\nKant admits that the only satisfactory explanations of particular\nphenomena in physiology, etc., are in physico-chemical terms ;\nthough\nhe thinks that men like Stahl (who used vitalistic conceptions and termino-\nlogy) have often been led to discover important facts which were overlooked\nby men like Boerhaave (who carefully eschewed them). We do not know\nhow far life extends in what we take to be inorganic matter, and in any\ncase the most that we can know of the influence of immaterial agencies in\norganic nature is that it exists, not how it operates or how far it extends.\nBut Kant holds that, subject to these limitations, we can conclude, with\nreasonable though not demonstrative certainty, from vital phenomena to\nimmaterial organizing entities obeying peculiar laws of their own. In so\nfar as these laws are concerned with the effects produced by these entities\nin living matter, they may be called organic laws ; in so far as they refer\nto the mutual interactions of such entities, they may be called pneumatic\nlaws.\nNow it would hardly be plausible to suppose that these immaterial\nentities are connected only indirectly with each other, through the inter-\nconnections of the various bodies with which they are severally connected.\nFor it might well be argued that at any moment only a comparatively\nsmall proportion of the immaterial substances are connected with bodies ;\nthat even these are also directly interconnected ; and that their connexion\nwith bodies is contingent and transient, whilst their direct interconnexions\nare intrinsic and permanent. So it is plausible to suppose that all these\nimmaterial substances are interconnected directly to form a single system,\nwhich we could call the immaterial or spiritual world.\n\f96 C. D. Broad [Part\nThis world would include (i) zW finite intelligences, some of which would\nbe united to living organisms to constitute persons, and others not\n;\n(ii) the sensitive souls of all animals ; and (iii) all organizing entities in\nnature, even when the vital phenomena which evince them do not include\nspontaneous movements. All these three kinds of immaterial substance\nwould form a system which does not depend on the peculiar conditions\nwhich govern the relations of bodies. Here, e.g., spatial and temporal\nseparations, which make the great clefts in the material world, would be\nnon-existent, though there might be other conditions of separation. A\nhuman soul during its earthly life would be a member of two worlds. As\nembodied, it would be especially associated with a certain region of space\nand stretch of time, and it would perceive clearly and affect voluntarily\nonly certain limited portions of the material world. But, as a member of\nthe spiritual world, it would not be located in physical space-time, and\nthere is no reason to think that spatio-temporal categories of any kind\nwould be applicable to it. In that capacity it would receive and impart\ninfluences of an immaterial kind. At death only the direct relations with\nother immaterial substances would remain, and the soul would become\nclearly aware of them.\nWe can now conceive the following possibilities, (i) That, even in this\nlife, each human soul is in close connexion with the rest of the immaterial\nworld, acts on it, and receives influences from it. But under normal\nconditions it is unaware of these actions and passions, (ii) That dis-\nembodied spirits have no conscious sense-perception of the material world.\nFor such a spirit is not connected with any particular organic body to form\na person, and thus has no location in the material world and no bodily\norgans through which to perceive and act upon it. (iii) That disembodied\nspirits can influence and be influenced by souls which are animating\nhuman bodies, since these are of the same nature as they and stand in\ndirect mutual relations with them. But disembodied spirits could not\nreceive and assimilate those ideas in embodied souls which depend upon\nthe body and its relations to the rest of the material world. Conversely\nembodied souls could not receive and assimilate the intuitive cognitions\nwhich disembodied spirits have of themselves and of other immaterial\nentities. At best each party could receive such ideas from the other only\nin a symbolic form.\nKant then considers certain psychological and ethical facts about men,\nwhich he thinks flt in very well with the hypothesis that our souls live\nin these two worlds. I am bound to say that I do not find his argument\nat all clear or convincing at this point.\nOne set of facts which he adduces is this. Each of us strongly desires\ncertain kinds of unity and co-operation with other men, and feels strong\npro-emotions towards such relationships, not as a mere means to his own\npreservation or happiness, but for their own sake. Such desires and\nemotions often conflict with others which are purely self-confined, such\nas desire for one's own happiness, fear of death, etc. Each man, e.g., quite\ndirectly desires and values the recognition and approval of himself and his\nactions by others. He likes to compare what he thinks good and true with\nwhat others think good and true ; he is disturbed if there is a difi'erence\nof opinion ; and he tries to secure agreement. Kant says that all this is\n\f178] Immanuel Kant and Psychical Research 97\n\" perhaps a feeling of the dependence of one's own judgments upon the\nuniversal human understanding, and a means of creating a kind of unified\nreason for the whole thinking being \". I take \" the universal human\nunderstanding \" to mean the supposed system of directly interconnected\nhuman spirits, embodied and disembodied ; and I take \" creating a kind\nof unified reason for the whole thinking being \" to mean increasing the\nunity of that system in such a way and to such an extent that it consti-\ntutes a kind of rational super-individual mind. If that is Kant's meaning,\nit seems to me to be an hypothesis which is barely intelligible in itself and\nderives little support from the empirical facts adduced in its favour.\nKant then passes from these to another set of facts which he considers\nto be \" more illuminating and easier to see \" for the present purpose.\nThese facts seem to me to be a strange mixture, and the interpretation of\nthem which Kant proposes is far from clear to me.\nI think that it will be best to translate the main passages. They nm as\nfollows. \" If we consider outer things in reference to our needs, we cannot\ndo so without at the same time feeling ourselves to be bound and limited\nby a certain feeling which makes us notice that a foreign will, as it were,\nis active in us and that a necessary condition for our own will and pleasure\n(BeliebeTi) is the concordance {Beistimmung) of others. A secret power\ncompels us to direct our intentions to the welfare of others or in accordance\nwith the choice of others, although this often goes against the grain and\nstrongly conflicts with selfish inclinations. . . . From this arise moral\nmotives . . . the rigid law of obligation and the weaker one of benevolence,\nboth of which extort many sacrifices from us. In consequence of this we\nperceive ourselves to be dependent in our innermost motives on the rule\nof the universal will. From this there arises in the world of all thinking\nbeings a moral unity and a systematic constitution according to purely\nspiritual laws. If we like to give the name moral feeling to this felt com-\npulsion on one's own will to adjust itself to the universal will, we are\nspeaking of it merely as a phenomenon which does in fact occur in us,\nwithout expressing any view as to its causes \".* (Kant then compares this\nto Newton's use of the word \" gravitation \" to describe the mathematical\nformula to which the mutual attraction of matter does in fact conform, and\nnot to suggest or imply any particular theory as to the causes of this\nphenomenon. But, he says, Newton had no doubt that the phenomenon\nof gravitation does evince a fundamental and universal activity of matter.)\nThe quotation now continues as follows. \" Would it not be possible to\nthink of the phenomena of moral motivation in thinking beings, in respect\nof their mutual relationships, as a consequence of a genuine active force by\nwhich spiritual beings influence each other.? In that case moral feeling\nwould be the felt dependence of one's private will on the universal v\/ill.\nIt would be a consequence of the natural and universal interaction, by\nwhich the immaterial world attains its moral unity as it develops into a\nsystem of spiritual completeness in accordance with the laws of its own\ninterconnexions.\"\nI would make the following comments on the passage which I have\nquoted, (i) As regards the first sentence, I will say only that it is highly\nobscure in the original and that my translation has been made after\n* The italics throughout are Kant's.\n\f98 C. D. Broad [Part\nconsulting an English colleague who is an expert in the German tongue.\nWhen this sentence is taken in its context the interpretation which I have\nput upon it seems to be the most plausible which the words and phrases\nwill allow.\n(ii) The phrase in the second sentence about directing our intentions\n\" in accordance with the choice of others \" is highly ambiguous. We do\nthis, e.g.y when we obey an order purely through fear, when we fall in with\nanother person's choice because we like him and desire to gratify his\nwishes, and when we follow the advice of a person, such as a doctor or a\nlawyer, whom we believe to be an expert. The second alternative might,\nperhaps, with a little stretching, be said to come under the \" weaker law\nof benevolence \" ; but none of them would seem to come under \" the\nrigid law of obligation \".\n(iii) I think it may well be true that many persons are inclined to\ninterpret their sense of obligation to do something which goes against the\ngrain as involving a kind of conflict between their own will and a foreign\nwill. And I think they would feel that the only proper solution is, not a\nrecalcitrant external obedience to that foreign will, but a transformation of\ntheir own will into conformity with it. But, in so far as a person puts this\ninterpretation on his feelings of moral obligation, I should have thought\nthat he regards the foreign will as that of some individual\u2014in the last\nresort God\u2014who has a moral right to such inward conformity of our\ndesires to his. Now Kant cannot here mean by the \" universal will\n\"\nthe will of God. It seems plain that he must regard it as a kind of collective\nwill, belonging to the system of all the inter-related finite spirits, con-\nsidered as a kind of super-individual mind. Now I do not believe that\nthis is an intelligible hypothesis ;\nand, even if it be so, I see no reason to\nthink that a person naturally interprets his experiences of moral obligation\nin terms of a conflict and a conformity between his private volitions and\nthe volitions of a collective mind composed of all the spirits that there are.\n(iv) What are we to make of the analogy with the Newtonian theory of\nuniversal gravitation.? What is supposed to be analogous to the phenom-\nenal facts which Newton explained, and what is supposed to be analogous\nto the underlying causes by which he explained them?\n{a) I think that the answer to the second part of the second question is\nfairly obvious. Newton's explanation was in terms of a system of material\nparticles attracting each other in accordance with a certain law, and subject\nin all their movements to the three laws of motion. Kant's explanation is\nto be in terms of a system of spirits in some kind of direct rapport with\neach other, so that changes in the inner state of each telepathically pro-\nduces correlated changes in the inner states of all the rest in accordance\nwith \" pneumatic \" laws.\n{b) What Newton explained by his theory of gravitation was a number\nof striking terrestrial and celestial rhythms, e.g., the tides, the orbital\nmotions of the planets in accordance with Kepler's laws, and so on. He\nfurther explained what might be called \" second-order \" rhythms, e.g.,\nthe precession of the equinoxes. He thus showed that a set of particles,\neach of which moves under the joint influence of its own originally\nimpressed momentum and the gravitational attraction of all the rest, will\n(if the originally impressed momenta fall within certain limits) settle down\n\f178] Immannel Kant and Psychical Research 99\ninto a stable system, characterized by certain large-scale rhythmic regu-\nlarities and by minor variations on these themes which are themselves\nregular and rhythmic.\nNow compare the originally impressed momentum of a particle to the\n\" private will \" of an individual spirit ; and compare the gravitational\nfield, due to the attraction of all the other particles, to the telepathic\ninfluence of the inner states of all other spirits on the inner state of this\nspirit. Then I take Kant's suggestion to be that the latter is felt by the\nindividual in the peculiar form of a feeling of \" moral obligation \". It is,\none might perhaps say, almost as if each were subject to a kind of hypnotic\nsuggestion, exercised telepathically and unwittingly by all the others, and\nreceived by the individual without conscious awareness of its source.\nKant suggests, if I understand him aright, that a set of spirits, each of which\nacts under the joint influence of its private will and the telepathically\nexercised hypnotic influence of all the rest, will settle down into a stable\nsystem, characterised by some kind of moral and spiritual pattern analogous\nto the rhythmic spatio-temporal pattern of the solar system.\n(5) Eschatological Consequences. Kant thinks that such a theory as has\nbeen sketched above would help to remove a difficulty which is very\ncommonly felt about the lack of correlation in this life between well-doing\nand well-being and between ill-doing and ill-being.\nThere is no special connexion between the rightness or wrongness of\na volition and the consequences which it has in the material world. A\nprecisely similar series of bodily movements, and therefore precisely\nsimilar results in the material world, might be initiated carelessly or\ndeliberately, and, if deliberately, either from a good motive or an evil one.\nBut these diff'erent causes, with the same effects in the material world,\nmight have very different effects in the spiritual world. For the moral\ncharacter of an act concerns the mner state which lies behind it in the agent;\nand so it can have its full effect, in respect of the features which make it\nmorally good or evil, only by its immedate telepathic influence on the\ninner states of other spirits. Their reaction, influencing telepathically the\noriginal agent, might make a great difference to his well-being or ill-being\nas a denizen of the spiritual world. In particular, the moral goodness or\nbadness of an embodied spirit's acts in this world might determine his\nrelationships of closer or less intimate rapport with other spirits, embodied\nand disembodied. Evil acts may lay one open to the telepathic influence\nof evil spirits, and put one out of telepathic rapport with good ones, and\nvice versa.\nWhen the soul is separated at death from the body which it has been\nanimating, its life in the spirit-world will be merely a continuance of those\nrelations with other spirits in which it has already been standing. The\ngoodness or badness of its acts done in the flesh will already have produced\ntheir consequences in the spiritual world, of which it has always been a\nmember ; and those consequences will now be manifest to it in the nature\nof the spiritual \" environment \" in which it will find itself. It will wake\nup on the spiritual bed which it has made for itself, and on which it has\nall the while been unwittingly lying during its dream-life in the world of\nmatter. This, Kant rightly thinks, is a great improvement on the popular\nreligious theory which regards future rewards and punishments as causally\n\flOO C. D. Broad [Part\ncontingent to virtue and vice, and as accruing only in consequence of\nGod's special volitions.\n(6) Our Cognitions as Members of the two Worlds. Kant deals next with\nthe following prima facie objection. If there is this community of spirits,\nand if each of us is at all times a member of it, is it not very odd that the\nfact is not perfectly well known to us all? Kant's solution is as follows.\nEach human soul has two quite different ideas of itself, (i) It knows itself\nas a spirit by means of a kind of non-sensuous intuition, through which it is\naware of itself in relation to other spirits, (ii) It knows itself as an embodied\nself through an image which originates from impressions arising from the\nstimulation of the sensory organs, internal and external, of the body. By\nthis means only material things and its relations to them can be presented\nto it. It is indeed one subject, which belongs both to the spiritual and the\nmaterial world. But it is not one and the same person in its two capacities.\nIts cognitions in one capacity do not link up with its cognitions in the\nother. What one cognizes as a spirit is not remembered by one as an\nembodied self, and one's cognitions of one's own states as an embodied\nself do not enter into one's cognitions of one's state as a spirit. However\nclear and intuitive one's awareness of the spirit-world may be to one as a\nmember of it, this does not enable one as an embodied self to perceive it.\nIn this life, under normal conditions, one can have no more than an\nabstract discursive conception of the spirit-world, reached by reasoning\nsuch as Kant has offered ; one cannot have an intuitive awareness or an\nempirically derived concept of it.\nKant compares the situation with that of the same man awake and\ndreamlessly asleep. No-one, he thinks, would have any difficulty in\nadmitting that, when a man is asleep, he may have clear conscious cog-\nnitions which he cannot recall when awake. He adduces the acts of\nsleep-walkers, which are often more intelligent than those of the same\nperson when awake, in support of this opinion. Indeed, Kant is inclined\nto think that mental activity in dreamless sleep is likely to be clearer and\nmore efficient than it can ever be in waking life, because disturbance from\nthe outer and inner bodily senses is at a minimum. But, for this very\nreason, cognitions had by the soul in dreamless sleep cannot be recalled in\nwaking life. In order for such recall to be possible there would have to be\nsome sensory link between the cognition in dreamless sleep and some\nsensation in present waking life. This would have to take the form of\nsome sensation in dreamless sleep, which was associated at the time with\nthe cognition and might be revived by a sufficiently similar waking\nsensation. But in dreamless sleep sensation, both from within and\nwithout the body, is in abeyance. Kant remarks that dreams, which he\ndefines for the present purpose as experiences had by a person when\nsleeping and remembered by him when awake, are here irrelevant. The\ndreamer may be said to be not fully asleep. He is wrapping up the\ncognitions which he has as a spirit in the impressions of his outer or inner\nbodily senses.\nIn spite of this we cannot wholly rule out the possibihty that our\nexperiences as spirits may occasionally insinuate themselves into our\nnormal waking consciousness. A spiritual cognition may do this through\nevoking by association sensory ideas which are related to it, viz., images or\n\f178] immamieJ Kant and Psychical Research *\ni6t\neven hallucinatory (7?\/rt\u00ab-sense-perceptions which are symbolical of the\nspiritually cognized fact or object. After all, both modes of cognition, the\nspiritual and the sensory, belong to the same thinking substance. We may\ncompare this possibility with the admitted fact that the higher rational\nconcepts generally need to be clothed in sensory symbols if they are to be\nintelligible to us. Kant refers, in this connexion, to the representation of\nduration by a line, that of eternity by endless time, and the representation\nof divine moral attributes in terms of human emotions, such as pity,\nanger, etc.\nBut, even if this seeping of spiritual cognitions in symbolical form into\neveryday consciousness be possible, it might be expected to be rare.\nIt would be likely to happen only in persons whose brains are specially\nexcitable, and thus more likely than those of most men to generate imagi-\nnative or quasi-sensory phantasies symbolical of spiritually cognized facts\nor objects. Such persons are apt to be presented with numerous objects\nwhich they take to be things of a spiritual nature actually present to their\nsenses. Really they are subject to an illusion of the imagination or an\nhallucination of the senses, but its ultimate origin is a genuine influence\nfrom the world of spirits upon them as members of that world.\nSuch symbolical but veridical phantasies would almost certainly be\nblended with ideas derived from education, tradition, etc., and in some\ncases with products of mere mental or bodily derangement. It must\nalways be very hard to disentangle the spiritual fact or object, symbol-\nically presented, from the wrapping of phantasy and hallucination. Again,\nthis state of \" permeability \", in which the brain and nervous system are\nactivated in an abnormal way by the purely spiritual cognitions of the\nsoul, would involve something which might fairly be called nervous\ninstability. It would therefore be quite likely that a genuine \" spirit-seer\n\"\nwould be subject to mere delusions and hallucinations, with no spiritual\nsignificance, along with his veridical symbolic experiences. In this\nconnection Kant compares the gift of seership with Juno's gift to Tiresias.\nIn order to confer on him the spiritual insight which enabled him to\nforesee the future she deprived him of his bodily eyesight\n(7) Connexion with Swedenborg's Doctrines. Now Swedenborg claimed\nto occupy a unique position both among men and among disembodied\nspirits, in that he and he alone lived consciously and almost continuously\nin both worlds. He was thus in a position to investigate the spirit-world\nfor himself, to cross-question its inhabitants and detect the errors and\nillusions to which they are subject, and to describe its nature and structure\nin ordinary human language on the basis of the information thus obtained.\nNow, as Kant points out, the information which Swedenborg claimed to\nhave got \" straight from the horse's mouth \" (if it be permissible to use\nsuch an expression in this context) agrees remarkably with the theory\nwhich Kant had reached by the reasoning outlined above. Kant does not\ngive Swedenborg much credit for this ; he says that it is \" as if a poet when\nhe raved happened to prophesy truly\". It might strike an impartial\nobserver that the agreement may not be wholly disconnected with the fact\nthat Kant had carefully read and epitomized Swedenborg's doctrine at the\ntime when he was pursuing his metaphysical speculations on this topic.\n(8) The psycho-physiological Conditions of waking sensory Hallucinations.\nD\n\f102 C. D. Broad [Part\nKant devotes Section III of Part I of the book to an eloborate discussion\nof the psycho-physiological conditions of waking sensory hallucinations.\nThe essential points may be stated as follows.\nThe case to be considered is that of a man who is perceiving by ordinary\nsight, touch, hearing, etc., his own body and the various external objects\nwhich other waking men in his neighbourhood perceive, but who also and\nsttnultaiieoiisly seems to himself to be perceiving other objects, imper-\nceptible to his neighbours, located at various places outside his body.\nThis case must be distinguished from ordinary dreaming. There the\nsubject does not perceive his own body by the external senses of sight and\ntouch, and he does not perceive any of the objects which waking men in\nhis neighbourhood perceive. It must also be distinguished from the case\nof a waking man who experiences very vivid images or even quasi-\nsensations but docs not locate their objects in external physical space or\nregard them as existing independently of himself.\nThe \" ghost-seer \" is an instance of the case under discussion. But so\ntoo is a person in delirium or madness. Suppose that the ghost-seer's\nexperience is delusive, in the sense that there is no physical object located\nat the place where the ghost is ostensibly seen to be and emitting or\nreflecting light to the seer's eyes. Then, even if there should be a spiritual\ncause at the back of the ghost-seer's experience, and if his experience\nshould be veridical in the sense of symbolizing that spiritual cause,\nessentially the same problem is raised by ostensible ghost-seeing and the\nwaking hallucinations of delirium or madness. It may be stated as\nfollows. How can a person project imaginative or ^\u00abrti\/-sensory contents,\nwhich are not evoked by physical stimuli impinging on his sense-organs\nfrom certain places in external physical space, into determinate external\npositions, so that they appear to him to stand in determinate spatial\nrelations to his own body and to other objects of normal sense-perception?\nKant puts forward tentatively a physiological answer to this question in\nterms of the old theory of \" animal spirits \", i.e., the theory that the\ninterstices in the brain and the supposed pores in the nerves are filled with\na very subtle fluid whose motions are correlated with our sensations and\nvolitions. I suppose that his theory could probably be recast in terms of\npresent-day views of neural impulses as transmissions of electrical or\nchemical states rather than translatory motions of a fluid.\nSo far as I can understand it, the suggestion may be put as follows.\nThe motions of the animal spirits in one's brain and nerves, which are\ninvolved in an actual sensation of sight or hearing, follow lines within the\nbody which, if produced, converge to a point or a limited region outside\nthe body. The motions of the animal spirits which are involved in having\na visual or auditory image normally follow lines which converge to a point\nor a limited region within the body. But in madness or delirium the normal\nequilibrium of the brain and nervous system is upset in such a way that\nthe motions of the animal spirits which are correlated with an image follow\nlines which converge to a point or a limited region outside the body. Thus\none seems to see objects, located in external space, corresponding to images\nhad under such conditions.\nNow it often happens that only one kind of sensible experience, viz.,\nthe visual, is disturbed, whilst the others, and in particular the tactual |\n4\n\f178] Immamiel Kant and Psychical Research 103\nand the muscular, are not. Thus one seems to see objects located in\nexternal space, which yet offer no resistance and are intangible. Now this\nis what is commonly told of ghosts. It also corresponds to the philo-\nsophical notion of a spirit, viz., a substance which can occupy a region of\nspace without offering any resistance to the entry of matter into the place\nwhich it occupies.\nKant remarks that it is likely that traditional stories of ghosts provide\nsome of the materials for the hallucinations of delirium or madness. If a\nman were in the same psycho-physiological condition, but lacked this\nbackground of tradition, his hallucinations might take a very different\nform.\n(9) The Conchision of the zvhole Matter. Kant was much too intelligent\na man to think that a psycho-physiological theory of the modus operandi of\nwaking sensory hallucination disproves the existence of spirits, or that it\ndisposes of the claim that some such experiences are initiated by the\ntelepathic action of a spirit on the soul of the experient and that they\nexpress in a symbolic form the spiritual event which initiated them.\nThough Kant does not explicitly say so, it is obvious that the test in each\ncase is, not the mere fact of ostensibly seeing an apparently independent\nfigure localized in physical space outside the body, but the question\nwhether the particular details of the experience itself and the particular\ncircumstances under which it happened strongly suggest that it was\ninitiated supernormally.\nBut, since the waking sensory hallucinations of delirium and madness\ninvolve the same psycho-physiological mechanism, and since most persons\nwho claim to be mediums are obviously to some extent unbalanced\nphysically and mentally, it is tempting to treat them all alike as merely\npathological phenomena requiring no supernormal explanation. Kant\nsays that anyone who takes this line will enjoy three advantages. He will\nbe able to make up his mind easily and quickly without needing to bother\nabout detailed investigation of particular cases. He will be explaining the\nfacts on the basis of materials provided by common experience instead of\nhaving recourse to the doubtful speculations of reason. And, above all,\nhe will avoid exposing himself to ridicule. For these reasons Kant will\nin no way blame anyone who regards every professed ghost-seer, not as a\nhalf-citizen of another world, but as a candidate for a mental hospital.\nBut he carefully refrains from saying that this is his own view. For him\nthe general plausibility of the theory of a world of spirits and of our double\ncitizenship in this world and in that is enough to keep him \" serious and\nundecided \" in view of such stories.\nYet, very characteristically, he half takes away with one hand what he\nhas so grudgingly given with the other. Were it not for our hope of a\nfuture life (which, he says, he cannot and would not eliminate) no-one\nwould attach any weight to the abstract possibilities which he has devel-\noped in the metaphysical part of the book. It would be much more\nreasonable, apart from that hope, to ascribe all these ostensibly super-\nnormal phenomena to natural causes than to postulate agents and modes\nof action so utterly unlike anything to which our senses bear witness.\nThe fact is that we are, and are doomed to remain, equally ignorant\nconcerning the three problems of (i) the animation of a human body by a\n\f104 D. Broad [Part 178]\nhuman soul at conception, (ii) the connexion of a soul with its body\nduring life, and (iii) its separation at death and its subsequent existence.\nWere it not for our hopes and fears about the future, we should be as\ncontent to refrain from speculation concerning the third problem as most\nmen have always been with regard to the other two.\nKant's final conclusion is completely agnostic. Beyond the bare\nabstract possibilities outlined in the metaphysical sections we can make no\nfurther progress either by rational speculation or by experiment and\nobservation. Genuine scientific hypotheses are concerned with the\ndetails of agents and forces which are already known to be possible because\nthey are already shown by sense-experience to be actual. But, in specu-\nlating about non-material thinking beings, standing to each other in non-\nspatio-temporal relations and interacting telepathically in accordance with\npneumatic laws, we are postulating agents and modes of action which we\ncannot know to be even possible. We have neither the guarantee of\nrational insight (as we sometimes have in pure mathematics) nor that of\ninstantiation by sense-perception (as we have in natural science).\nAdmittedly, in the case of ghost-stories we have certain alleged experi-\nences of a 9\u00aba5\/-sensory nature. But, Kant says, the lack of agreement and\nuniformity which is characteristic of such experiences makes them useless\nas a foundation for any proposed laws concerning which reason might\npass judgment. They show only certain anomalies and irregularities in\nthe functioning of the senses, and, as such, it is reasonable to discount them.\nKant seems never to have contemplated the possibility of an experi-\nmental investigation of ostensibly supernormal cognitive and active\npowers. He does not even envisage the careful investigation and com-\nparative study of the sporadic cases, such as was first attempted in\nPhantasms of the Living, nor a synoptic survey of the whole field of normal,\nabnormal, and ostensibly supernormal mental phenomena, such as Myers\nmade in his Human Personality. The fact that so great a man, speculating\nseriously on this topic, did not consider these possibilities, and that they\nhave now been in so large a measure realized, should increase our gratitude\nand admiration for the pioneers of psychical research in England, America,\nand the continent of Europe. It is, perhaps, permissible to conclude with\nthe phantasy that news of these later developments has seeped through in a\nsymbolic form to the disembodied spirit of the sage of Konigsberg, and\nthat he has received it with interest and approval.\n\fA FURTHER TEST FOR SURVIVAE\nBy T.

Thouless\n\/. Introduction.\nIn 1943 Professor Rhine first reported experiments which had been\ngoing on for several years in his laboratory in which it appeared that some\nexperimental subjects were able to influence the fall of the dice so that\nthey fell more frequently than could be attributed to chance alone with\nthat face uppermost which was the target intended by the subject.^ He\ncalled this psycho-kinesis (or PK). It is sometimes said that these successes\nhave not been repeated in this country. This is not quite correct since I\nreported in 1945 a limited but definite success in influencing the fall of a\nspun coin.'^ Mr Whately Carington has also carried out experiments with\ndice using his wife as subject which he considered were not wholly negative\n(unpublished). More recently Dr E. A. G. Knowles, an English engin-\neering mathematician, was surprised to find that she obtained significant\nevidence for PK in a series of experiments which were intended to show\nthat nothing but a chance result would come from such an experiment.^\nIt remains true that the volume of successful PK experimentation in\nthis country is still relatively small. During a visit to Professor Rhine's\nlaboratory in the autumn of 1948, I found that I was able to succeed in\nPK experiments with dice. It seemed worth while, therefore, during the\nwinter of 1948\/49, to try to repeat this success at home. My object was\nthreefold. First, to see whether I could increase the relatively scanty\nrecord of PK successes in Great Britain. Secondly, to try to devise a\nmethod of experimenting which would eliminate the possibility of success\nbeing due to an unconscious skill in throwing or to precognition of the way\nin which the dice would fall, and which also would meet some other\nobjections that have sometimes been made to some of the Duke experi-\nments. Thirdly, I hoped to find out something about the psychological\nfactors determining success and failure in these experiments in the hope\nthat I should make it easier for other investigators to repeat any success\nI might have if they felt so inclined.\nAll the experiments which are the subject of this report were done on\nmyself as both subject and experimenter and were unwitnessed (although\nother people were sometim.es present). I find it quite im.practicable to\nH 107\n\fio8 Robert H. Thouless [Part\nprovide witnesses for experiments which must be htted into odd times\nwhen I happen to have a spare twenty minutes. This would render these\nexperiments unconvincing as evidence for the reaUty of PK if that reality\nhad not already been established by a number of witnessed experiments at\nDuke University parapsychological laboratory. The primary purpose of\nmy experiments was not, however, to create conviction in other people\nbut to satisfy myself as to whether I could obtain positive PK results by\nself-experimentation using the methods described below, and if so under\nwhat conditions. The best road to conviction is neither my testimony nor\nthat of a multitude of witnesses, but the ability to achieve success in such\nexperiments one's self. I hope that the suggestions I make in the later\npart of this report will be of some help in enabling those who are sceptical\nof the PK effect to convince themselves by their own success in carrying\nout such experiments.\nSome of my experiments were done with dice thrown by hand from a\nshaker ; these are referred to in this article as \" hand-thrown \". I do not\nregard these as crucial evidence for the operation of psycho-kinesis, since\nthe conditions of throwing do not exclude the possibility of success being\ndue to skill in throwing. On the other hand, I have no reason for suppos-\ning that success in hand-thrown experiments is due to this cause, and such\nevidence as I have strongly suggests that the factor at work in these\nexperiments is the same as that operating in mechanically thrown dice.\nThe remainder of the experiments were done by a method of machine-\nthrowing which completely excludes the possibility of any sort of skill\ncausing the results. A method of randomising the targets by means of\nLatin squares was also introduced partly in order to exclude the possi-\nbility that success might be due to precognition of the dice falls, and\npartly to exclude the possibility (suggested by Mr Parsons) that position\neffects might be due to progressive physical changes in the dice. The dice\nused were plastic inlaid dice kindly supplied by Professor Rhine. In all\ncases four dice were used for each throw, partly for the accidental reason\nthat this happened to be the number I brought back from Duke University,\npartly for the reason that with four dice there are about even chances of at\nleast one success by chance alone, so the experimental subject is saved\nfrom the tendency to discouragement by a large number of complete\nfailures. These dice were marked with the letters A, B, C and D, and\ntheir falls were recorded separately in that order. I always recorded all\ndice falls, both success and failures, and as a further precaution against\nthe possibility of errors in recording, I repeated the count of the faces\nuppermost after the recording.\nFor machine-throwing, the apparatus shown in Fig. i was used. I\nwished to exclude all possible ways in which the fall of the dice could be\nsupposed to be influenced by the voluntary activity of the subject. Their\ninitial position was, therefore, prescribed. The dice were placed on the\nmachine with the i face outwards from the board while the 2 face was\nupwards from the gate. The order was (from left to right) ABCD, and\nthe four dice were placed compactly with A in contact with the left hand\nstop above the gate. They were released by pulling a string which moved\na latch from under the left-hand end of the gate so that the gate fell under\nthe influence of gravity. The speed and way of falling could not, there-\n\f179] ^ Report on Psycho-kinesis with Dice 109\nfore, be influenced in any respect by the way in which the subject operated\nthe release. When the gate fell, the dice slid forward down a hinged board\nat an angle of about 45\u00b0 and were given a rotation by striking a projecting\nband of corrugated rubber and fell rolling on the floor at about i foot\nvertical distance from the initial height of the dice.\n\/i\nDICE\nA B coy\n\u00ab \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ^\nFALLING GATE \u2022\nLATCH OPERATED BY STRING\n7\nCORRUGATED RUBBER\nFig. I. \u2014Apparatus for mechanical throwing.\nIt is obvious that this rigid prescription of the initial position and\nmanner of fall of the dice might produce a tendency for the frequency\nof different faces to fall uppermost to be far from equal. This does not\naffect the validity of the method since any such departure from equi-\nprobability would only reproduce the normal efli'ects of bias which do not\naff\"ect mean chance expectation of success in a properly designed experi-\nment (e.g. one in which each face is target for an equal number of times).\nThe variance will be somewhat afl'ected by departure from equiprobability\nbut only in a direction which will lead to an error in the safe direction, i.e.\nto an underestimation of the significance of any observed deviation. This\neffect may, therefore, be ignored unless the departure from equal distribu-\ntion of falls is extreme.\nIn fact, the departure from equality proved to be very small. Since the\ninitial position of the dice in the machine-thrown experiments was such\nthat the 3 and 4 faces were at right angles to the surface on to which they\nfell, it is to be expected that these faces would fall uppermost less fre-\nquently than the others. This proved to be the case. The distribution of\nfaces for the 5,184 machine thrown falls of Expts. IIa and IIb taken\ntogether are shewn in Table i.\nTable i\n*\nFaces uppermost\n(I) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) Total\nObserved - - - 918 892 819 821 882 852 5,184\nDevn. from expn. - +54 +28 -45 -43 +18 -12\n\f110 Robert H. Thoiiless [Part\nWhat the table suggests at first sight is the presence of the expected\ndeficiency of 3s and 4s, superimposed on a general bias favouring low-\nvalued faces. The deviations in this table are, however, not large enough\nfor significance, the odds being only about 10 to i against all deviations\noccurring by chance variation from equal probability (chi\" = 9-3, \u00ab = 5,\nP= -i).\nIf, however, we consider separately the question of whether there is a\nreal deficiency of 3s and 4s, we have the following table ;\nTable 2\n3 4 faces all others Total\nObserved ----- 1640 3544 5184\nExpected ----- lyaS 3456 5184\nDeviation - - - - - -88 +88\nThis gives chi2 = 6-65, \u00ab = i, P = -oi. The odds are thus 100 to i\nagainst this deficiency of 3s and 4s arising by chance. The deficiency\nis, however, satisfactorily small, being only about 5%.\nIt is not possible to give a definite answer to the question as to whether\nany part of the remaining inequality of the faces is due to bias. If we\nconsider only the 3,544 faces which were not 3s or 4s we should expect\n886 falls on each of the remaining four faces. The deviations from this\nexpectation of the remaining four faces is shown in Table 3.\nTable 3\n(I) (2) (5) (6) Total\nObserved - - - - 918 892 882 852 3544\nDevn. from expn. - - +32 +6 -4 -34\nChi- for Table 3 is 2-52, which with ?z = 3 gives P = '^. The deviations\nfrom expectation are, therefore, only such as would be expected by chance\nalone. The fact that the values of the deviations fall in the order i, 2, 5, 6\ncertainly seems to suggest a bias efi^ect, but this suggestion has no real\nstrength since the odds against this or the opposite serial order arising by\nchance are only 12 to i. If bias is present, its amount is so small that\nanalysis of a very much larger number of falls than all I have available\nwould be necessary for a demonstration of its significance. In any case,\nthe question is not of suflncient importance to justify so much labour. We\ncan be confident that if bias is present, it is to a small amount. If the\ndeparture from equality shown in Table 3 were entirely due to bias, the\namount of this bias would only be about 4% for extreme values. The\nabsence of appreciable bias was confirmed by an examination of 864\nhand-thrown falls in which there was no appreciable departure from equal\nprobability of faces and no indication of the serial effect seen in Table 3.\nThis does not mean, of course, that a method of assessment assuming\nfreedom from bias can safely be used. A method of assessment giving a\nresult which is independent of any bias of the dice must be used in all\ncases.\nThe purpose of the standardisation of the initial position of the dice\non the machine was to eliminate the possibility that success might be due\nto a process of acquiring skill or to some other paranormal process than\n\f179] A Report on Psycho-kinesis with Dice iii\nPK, e.g. to the subject's knowledge by a psi process that a certain initial\nposition of the dice or a certain method of releasing them would favour\nthe appearance of that face which is the target. For this purpose, it is\nalso necessary to deny him (and the experimenter) any liberty as to choice\nof target faces, since otherwise he might be guided in choice of target face\nby precognitive psi knowledge of which faces were going to fall uppermost\nmost frequently in a series of throws. The method I have adopted for\ndetermining the sequence of targets is by use of a 6 x 6 Latin square, that\nis, a square containing the numbers i to 6 arranged in six rows in such a\nway that each number occurs once and once only in each row and in each\ncolumn. A series of such Latin squares is to be found in Fisher and Yates's\nmathematical tables. One of their basic forms is selected by a random\nmethod, and its rows and columns are then randomly permuted by means\nof dice throws. The successive lines of the square were then used for the\nsequence of target faces. One row of a Latin square was used for the\nsuccession of targets on a single occasion, six or three throws of the four\ndice being made in succession for each target face. After a Latin square\nhad been used, it was not repeated but the next experiments were done\nwith a new square obtained by a new permutation of the rows and columns.\nFor example, the target sequences for the first six occasions w-ere deter-\nmined by the rows of the Latin square :\n256341\n542613\n463152\n135264\n621435\n- 314526\nThis method of target determination has several advantages. First, each\nsix sets of throws determined by a single row has all target faces an equal\nnumber of times so the total number of successes expected by chance is\nindependent of the bias of the dice. Secondly, after six (or any multiple\nof six) such sets of throws, each target has occurred an equal number of\ntimes in every position. This is very desirable for the estimation of\nposition effects ; i.e. the tendency to score higher in some parts of a\nseries than in others. Unless each target has occurred equally often in\nevery position, it is possible that an apparent position effect may be due\nto bias or to target preference : i.e. the tendency to score better on some\nfaces than on others. Unless this precaution is taken it does not seem\npossible to make a separate assessment of position effect and target\npreference.\nIt also seems to be the most satisfactory way of dealing with a possi-\nbility that has been suggested by Mr Parsons that position effects might be\ndue to progressive physical changes in the dice during the course of\nexperimentation. It is certainly possible that such changes may take place\nand may tend to produce progressive changes in the frequencies of falls\nof different faces, and that under some conditions of experimenting such\nchanges might produce a spurious appearance of change in rate of success.\nIf, however, position changes in scoring rate were found consistently\nthrough a Latin square, they could not be explained in this way, since\nE2\n\f112 Robert H. Thouless [Part\nphysical changes that would favour one direction of change in scoring rate\nin one part of the square would be neutralised by opposite changes in\nscoring in other parts of the square. It would indeed be necessary to\npostulate some kind of physical change which made them consistently\nchange in a way determined by which face was target. This is clearly\nabsurd except on the hypothesis that PK is taking place.\nThe first object of the Latin square arrangement of targets is to secure\nnot only that the total experiment has an equal number of each target\nface so that without undue labour in computation one may make an\nassessment of the significance of the total deviation which will be inde-\npendent of target bias, but also that every sub-unit of the experiment used\nin any comparison (such as that of different positions in the experiment)\nmay also have an equal number of each target face. Obviously this end\nmight be secured by other means than the Latin square. In a later\nexperiment to be reported below (the W^,^ experiment) a similar result was\nobtained by arranging the target faces by the shuffling of a pack of six\ncards numbered i to 6. This does not give equal numbers of targets in\neach position, but it gives a random number of targets in each position\ni.e. one that will differ from equality only by a chance amount. This\nwould give an equally valid but less economical way of assessing position\neffects.\nThe second purpose of the use of the Latin square is to remove from\nexperimenter and subject all choice as to target face so as to make success\nimpossible of explanation by precognition of the dice falls. It is obvious\nthat if either experimenter or subject has free choice of target face, a\nlimited but considerable success might be obtained if the person choosing\nthe target face knew by precognition which were going to be the most\nfrequent falls in each sub-unit of the experiment for which the target face\nwas chosen. This is so obviously a defective form of PK experiment that\nit is rarely employed now. There is, however, a wider possibility of the\ninfluence of precognition. Since a PK experiment necessarily consists of a\nsystem of targets chosen in some manner and a system of falls, it seems\npossible that any success might be explained by the assumption that the\nchoice of targets was determined by a precognitive knowledge of the falls\nin whatever manner the targets were chosen. Even if the target sequences\nwere chosen by a randomising machine, the machine must have been\nstarted at a particular time by somebody and if he had precognitive\nknowledge both of the targets the machine was going to select and of the\nfalls of the dice in the subsequent experiment it might be possible that he\nstarted the machine at such a time or in such a way that it gave the targets\nwhich would correspond with the dice falls in the experiment. Such an\nexplanation would not be a very plausible one, but if it is theoretically\npossible then one has not got a method of demonstrating PK in a manner\nwhich cannot be explained by precognition.\nThe experimental separation of PK and precognition may indeed be\nimpossible if these are assumed to work with ioo% accuracy, but it is\nnot difficult to design a PK experiment which cannot be explained by\nprecognition if the ability to precognise is assumed to be as fallible as\nexperiments on precognition show it to be. This can be done by using\na system of target selection such that the arrangement of targets depends\n\f179] A Report on Psycho-kinesis with Dice 113\non a number of independent contingent events and could only be known\nif all those events were correctly precognised. I think that this condition\nis fulfilled by the Latin square method of selection. The basic square is\none of seventeen given in Fisher and Yates's tables. If this basic square\nis selected by a random method, the square selected would have to be\ncorrectly precognised in order that the experimenter should have any\nidea of what are to be the target faces. If his dice chose the seventh square\nand he was nearly but not quite correct in his precognition, he would\nbe expecting a wholly different square from the one actually employed, not\none that was nearly right. Nothing but an exactly right precognition\nwould produce any effect on his results. Even if he has performed the\nremarkable precognitive feat of guessing the right basic square, he would\nalso have to precognise the dice falls that determine the permutations of the\ncolumns and rows of the basic square. If he could precognise with 17%\naccuracy (which would be a remarkably good precognition score), that\nwould only make right one target position out of the thirty-six of the\ncomplete square, in addition to those that would be right by chance alone.\nThat would make very little difference to his final score, and for the second\nand third squares, the effect of any such rate of correct precognition would\nhave no measurable effect since it would be necessary to precognise also\nthe new sets of permutations of rows and columns for these squares.\nPlainly no level of precognitive success such as we find experimentally\ncould produce any spurious success in a PK experiment designed in this\nway. Success in such a PK experiment can only be explained by pre-\ncognition if we make the absurd assumption that when we are doing a PK\nexperiment, we can precognise with an incomparably greater accuracy than\nwhen we are doing a precognition experiment.\nI admit that there may be one somewhat serious objection to the Latin\nSquare method of PK experimenting. It is not unlikely that the frequent\nand arbitrary changes in target are unfavourable to PK success so that it\nmay be a relatively unfruitful method of working. I have no evidence that\nit is so, but it is not unlikely. I have myself obtained success in working\nwith this method but it is quite possible that I should have had much\nbetter success by a method which did not involve such frequent changes of\ntarget.\n\/\/. The First Series of Experiments.\nIn these and all other experiments here reported I acted both as subject\nand experimenter. In some of the experiments I was alone, in others I\nwas working in competition with other people, but in no case was there\nany formal witnessing of results. In my report I have included only my\nown results w^hen I was working with other people.\nDuring the Christmas vacation of 1948\/49, I carried out a long series of\nexperiments with a variety of methods using both machine throwing and\nhand throwing of the dice. It would be tedious to report these in detail\nsince much better evidence of the reality of the PK effect is provided by a\nlater series which I will report more fully. For some of the first of these\nexperiments I used a modification of the Latin square method which did\nnot involve complete equality of throws for different targets. This was\nafterwards abandoned since, although perfectly valid, it was uneconomical\nsince it required a laborious method of assessment. The experiment\n\f114 Robert H. Thouless [Part\nstarted very encouragingly with 36 successes on the first day in 148 falls,\nwith a probability against so large a deviation occurring in a chance series\nof ICQ to I. As is usual in such experimentation, however, decline set in\nand after about four weeks, there were strong indications of a tendency to\nscore below mean chance expectation. As new forms of experiment were\nstarted, they generally were successful at the beginning and declined to\nmean chance expectation after a few days. The final total result for this\nseries was 16,232 falls (machine thrown and hand thrown together) with\n2,809 hits on the target face. The excess of hits over mean chance expec-\ntation is 103! which is 2- 18 times its standard error. The excess is just\nsignificant (odds against occurrence in a chance series of about 33 to i)\nbut not sufficiently so for this result in itself to provide sufficient evidence\nfor the reality of the PK efli'ect.\nOn the other hand, there were abundant indications of a real PK effect\nin these experiments apart from the total score. The smallness of the\nover-all deviation above mean chance expectation seemed largely due to\nthe fact that the rate of success tended to fall off with time. Thus the last\nbatch of results by the machine throwing method was a set of 24 runs\n{i.e. 576 single die falls) with a deviation of 19 hits below mean chance\nexpectation. This gives a critical ratio of 2-1 (P about -03) which suggests\n(although it is by no means strong evidence for) a real tendency to score\nbelow mean chance expectation at this stage of the experiment. In contrast\nthe first 24 runs of this experiment showed a deviation of 15 hits above\nmean chance expectation. The difference between the scores at the\nbeginning and the end of the experiment was, therefore, 34 with a standard\nerror of 12-64. This gives a critical ratio of 2-7 and the odds against so\nlarge a difference occurring in a chance series are rather better than a\n100 to I. This is fairly good evidence for the reality of the decline effect,\nparticularly when we consider that a similar falling off in score was shown\nin other parts of the experimental series.\nThe evidence for decline is also evidence for PK, that is against the\nhypothesis that there is no inffuence on the fall of the dice of the intention\nof the subject. Nevertheless it is evidence of a kind which must be\naccepted with some caution since the primary purpose of the experiments\nwas to obtain a significant deviation from mean chance expectation. One\nmust be careful not to regard unexpected peculiarities of experimental data\nas substitutes for the primary evidence which it was the purpose of the\nexperiment to obtain. On the other hand, chronological decline is a\ncharacteristic of psi results which we already have grounds for expecting\nfrom other investigations, so it is not unreasonable to regard its appear-\nance in these results as additional grounds for considering that PK was\noperating here, giving further confidence in the indications of the over-all\npositive deviation already obtained and encouragement to carry on further\ninvestigation along the same lines.\n\/\/\/. The Secotid Series of Experiments.\nI felt that I had accumulated experience in this first experiment and\nknew better how to avoid the extreme effects of chronological decline.\nThe first series of experiments had been done during vacation when I\ncould devote all my spare time and most of my waking thoughts to the\nexperiment, and it seemed to me that as I had worked harder at it and\n\f179] A Report on Psycho-kinesis with Dice 115\nthought more about it, the positive results fell off. I decided, therefore, to\nprofit by the experience gained in this first series of experiments and to\ncarry out a second set of experiments done entirely by the machine-\nthrowing method in which I hoped to get a better positive deviation by\navoiding so far as possible the causes of chronological decline and other\nfactors productive of low scoring. Particularly I could avoid the intense\nconcentration on the experiment which I suspected was an important factor\nin producing the decline observed in the first batch.\nI resolved, therefore, to do this second experiment in small parts at a\ntime, allowing intervals between occasions, sometimes of a week or more,\nsometimes of a few hours. On each occasion of the first of the second\nseries of experiments (referred to as experiment IIa), I made three throws\nof four dice at each of the targets in one row of a Latin square. The pre-\ndetermined length of the whole experiment was 36 experimental occasions.\nAll throws were made by a machine in the manner described earlier.\nAll dice falls were recorded in the die order ABCD. This recording of\nall falls seems to me to be an important safeguard against the danger of\nmiscounting. After recording, I looked at the dice again before picking\nthem up to make sure that m.v record was correct. I am satisfied that no\nmistakes were made in recording falls. Mistakes in counting the number\nof successes can, of course, be easily avoided by subsequent rechecking of\nthe count from the record. This has always been done.\nTo make the experimental method more clear, I add the record for the\nfirst two experimental sittings (Table 4).\n30\/1\/49 (2)\n1 1. 1\n5 a.m. 3446\n3224\n3652\n31\/1\/49 (5)\n10. 45 a.m. 2125\n3646\n3254\nTable 4\n(5) (6) (3)\n5524 2622 2454\n5316 1633 4542\n6365 2536 2J22\n(4) (2) (6)\n6321 3122 6563\n6151 2362 1655\n36^ 1222 2134\n(4) (i) devn.\n-\/1 13 25x6\n1665 6532\n6361 622'3 +2\n(I) (3)\n26x6 4515\n54J6 4425\n1262 414J +8\nRecord of first two occasions of Expt. IIa\n(target figures are those in brackets).\nThe final deviation from expectation in this experiment was an excess\nof 42 hits over mean chance expectation with odds against chance occur-\nrence of about 40 to I . This was an encouraging result although it is not\nenough for strong conviction if the experiment stood alone.\nAnother point in which I had become interested when starting experi-\nment IIa was the problem of the specificity of the inhibition leading to\nchronological decline. It appeared that one kind of experiment might be\ninhibited while another was succeeding. I had immediately before this\ntime done a very large number of hand-thrown experiments for several\nweeks (included in the Expt. I results reported above) and I had dropped\nto chance scoring when working by this method. I was anxious to see,\ntherefore, whether this failure in hand-thrown experiments would con-\n\fii6 Robert H. Thouless [Part\ntinue even though I might be succeeding in a machine-thrown series. So\nduring the first 24 experimental occasions of 1 1 A, I did an equal number of\nhand-thrown experiments (Expt. I-\"^) alternately before and after the\nmachine-thrown experiments. These were not intended to be included\nin Expt. II whether they were successful or unsuccessful since Expt. II\nwas to be exclusively machine-thrown. Their results are, of course,\nincluded in the over-all total results shown in Table 8.\nThe result of this comparison between the scoring rate at that time of\nmachine- and hand-thrown experiments is shown on Table 5.\nTable 5\nTotal Standard Critical\nMethod falls Devil. error ratio P\nMachine - 1728 + 34 15-5 2-2 \u202203\nHand - - 1728 - 9 15-5 \u20226 \u202255\nDifference 43 21-9 1-96 05\nThe difference in favour of the machine-thrown rate of success is large\nenough to suggest strongly that there was a real difference at this stage\nof experimenting between the scoring rates from the two methods of\nthrowing. It cannot be concluded that machine-throwing necessarily pro-\nduces better PK results than hand-throwing since at an earlier stage of my\nwork I was succeeding by hand-throwing when machine-throwing was pro-\nducing negative results. There is, however, some evidence that the inhibi-\ntion of hand-thrown results is more lasting than that of the machine-\nthrown, although I have no positive proof that this is the case.\nOn the 25th occasion of Experiment IIa (Experiment I''^ having been\ncompleted), I started a new machine-thrown experiment (Expt. IIb)\nwhich I continued to the same length as IIa, that is, to 108 runs or 2,592\nsingle die falls. This experiment was done by a method which I had\ndeveloped during the course of the earlier series of experiments. It is, I\nthink, an interesting novelty and it may be found a useful variant from the\nmore usual methods of PK experimenting. I have called it the Wy,^\ntechnique since it involves both (ESP) and (PK)- Essentially\nit is a PK experiment in which the target face is not known by normal\nmeans to the subject. Six cards numbered 1-6 are shuffled and laid face\ndownwards in a heap before the subject. The cards are not disturbed\nuntil the check is made at the end of the attempt at all six targets. I he\nfour dice are then thrown with the intention that on the first throw the\ntop faces of the dice shall be that number which is on the first card of the\nheap, on the second throw that of the second card, and so on. After six\nthrows have been made and recorded, the results are compared with the\nnumbers on the cards. Eight sets of six cards were used and, after the\ncompletion of one run, the set of cards just used was put on one side\nand a fresh set was shuffled for the next experiment. All throws in this\nexperiment (as in IIa) were machine-thrown.\nAlthough to succeed in the task of hitting a target without knowing\nwhat the target is may appear an impossibility, I have found this form of\nexperiment successful both with myself and with other subjects. I also\nhear from Dr Betty Humphrey that she has had good success with this\n\f179] A Report on Psycho-kinesis with Dice 117\nmethod at Duke University. It is difficult to determine whether it is a\nmore fruitful method than that with a known target, both because there\nare individual differences between experimental subjects as to the tests\nin which they score best and also because scoring rate at a particular test\ndepends on the previous history of the subject with respect to that form\nof test. For example, a subject who has developed a chronological decline\nin his results for PK tests of the ordinary type may score better when\ntried with this test simply because it is a novel task and not because it is\nintrinsically a more fruitful method. It seems, however, to give as good\nresults as other ways of testing PK and I have some hope that it may prove\nto be generally more favourable to good scoring. Its advantage, I think,\nlies in the fact that the whole operation lies within the limits of psi-\ndetermined processes so there is less temptation to the subject to use\nconscious volition. A subject finds it hard to try to get the dice to fall the\nright way up if he does not know which is the right way, and not trying is,\nI believe, favourable to success. We seem to be asking the subject to\nperform an impossible task, and the attitude he is inclined to adopt to an\nimpossible task is a good attitude for psi performance.\nOn each experimental occasion, I worked through three sets of six cards\nwith the exception of the 12 runs from 85 to 96 inclusive when I tried the\nexperiment of reducing the amount done to one run per occasion. To\nmake the method of experimenting more clear, I show in Table 6, the\ndetailed results of the first three occasions.\nTable 6\nDevn.\n16\/3\/49 [i] 6553 (5) 2 [2] 2613 (4) 0 (3) 5J2I (3) I\n10.15 a.m. 1326 (6) I IJ22 (3) I 2356 (i) 0\n4454 (4) 3 6222 (2) 3 5513 (2) 0\nj-465 (i) I 5663 (I) 0 1311 (6) 0\ni\"5 (3) 0 5221 (6) 0 3635 (4) 0\n41 16 (2) 0 1232 (5) 0 2221 (5) 0\n7 4 I\n16\/3\/49 [4] 3^-^\/ (i) 3 [5] 1665 (5) I [6] 5212 (3) I\n5.20 p.m. 3263 (6) I 1563 (2) 0 2526 (2) 2\n5231 (3) I 2162 (4) 0 6341 (6) I\n6636 (5) 0 3363 (i) 0 6341 (5) 0\n3221 (4) 0 5644 (6) I 3525 (4) 0\n4664 (2) 0 5666 (3) 0 4242 (i) 0\n5 2 4\n17\/3\/49 [7] 5146 (2) 0 [8] 3453 (6) 0 [9] 2266 (6) 2\n5625(3) I IJ36 (i) 2 5156 (5) 2\n5561 (6) I 5525 (2) I 2616 (3) 0\n-^434 ( 0 I 3452 (3) 2 1 122 (2) 2\n5466(5) I ^515 (4) I 2216 (4) 0\n5363 (4) 0 5562 (5) 2 5166 (I) I\n4 8 7\n\fii8 Robert H.

The figure 5 in round brackets\nis the number of the top card in the pack which determined the first\ntarget so the score for that fall was 2 as shewn by the last figure in the line.\nThe total result of Experiment IIb was an excess of +33 hits over mean\nchance expectation. This excess, with a critical ratio of i-So is not quite\nenough for separate significance. The whole of Experiment II [i.e. IIa\nand IIb together) has a total deviation which, as will be shown in the next\nsection, is strongly significant. There is also a strongly marked position\neffect in IIb, the first run of each occasion showing a tendency to high\ndeviations from mean chance expectation. Such secondary characteristics\nof the data, which were not primarily aimed at in the design of the experi-\nment must, of course, be admitted with great caution as evidence for the\ninfluence of PK, particularly since, although there was prior reason for\nexpecting position eff^ects, there was no reason for expecting it in this\nparticular form. On the other hand, the departure from expectation is\nvery considerable, so the position effect may perhaps safely be considered\nas supporting evidence for the operation of PK in this experiment.\nIV. Results.\nExperiment II was intended to provide a block of results obtained by\nthe use of machine throwing to see whether positive PK results can be\nobtained under conditions which preclude explanation by any kind of\nskilled throwing. The total result of this experiment was strongly signi-\nficant, an excess of hits over mean chance being obtained such that the\nodds against the excess occurring in a chance series were 200 to i.

In\nview of the system of randomisation of targets, explanation by pre-\ncognition seems also to be effectively excluded.

The results may, therefore, be\nconsidered to show strong evidence for the reality of the influence on the\nfall of the dice of the intention of the experimental subject, that is, for* the\noperation of the PK effect.\nV. Position effects and target preference.\nThe main purpose of the design of this experiment was to see whether\na deviation of score could be obtained greater than that reasonably attribut-\nable to chance. One may also ask whether the results showed any of the\ncharacteristics which other investigators have found in PK data, although\npresence of such secondary characteristics could not be accepted as good\nevidence for PK unless the experiment had been designed to look for\nthem or alternatively they attained a very high level of significance and\nthere was sound reason based on previous investigations for expecting\nthem.\nIn many experiments position effects have been reported, i.e. differences\nin scoring rate at different points of an experimental occasion. In Experi-\nment IIa, a half run {i.e. twelve single die falls) was made on each occasion\nfor each of the six target faces. Since by the use of the Latin square it\nwas ensured that during every six occasions each target occupied each of\nthe six possible positions, it follows that any multiple of six occasions can\nprovide evidence as to whether there is a tendency to score differently on\nthe first, second, etc. half-run, and that any tendency which appears\ncannot be attributed either to a physically determined change in the fall of\nthe dice favouring different targets at different stages of the experimental\noccasion, or to a tendency of the subject to score better on some target\nfaces than others. At the end of this experiment, there had been 432 falls in\neach of the six positions ; the number of hits in each position is shown in\nTable 9 (72 being mean chance expectation for each position).\nTable 9\nHalf-runs - - ist 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th Mean\nHits - - 88 64 88 80 73 81 79\nDevn. from mean +9 -15 +9 +1 -6 +2\nIf there is any position effect in this table, it is clearly not a tendency as\nsimple as the usually reported tendency to score high at the beginning and\nend of an experimental occasion. What is suggested is rather a maximum\nscoring rate at the beginning and end and middle of the series. It must,\nhowever, be determined whether there is any reason for supposing that\nthis is a real effect or whether it is only such a difference as might occur by\nchance. The evidence on this question is provided by discovering\nwhether the variance of these quantities is significantly greater than that\nto be expected on the hypothesis that they are chance deviations from the\nobserved mean of 79. The observed variance of the totals in each position\nis 85-6. The expected value of the variance on the hypothesis that\n\fI20 Robert H. Thonless [Part\ndifferences between scores have arisen by chance is 64-6.^ The ratio of\n1-32 of the observed to the expected value of the variance of these scores is\ntoo small for significance. There is, therefore, no evidence for any\ndifference in scoring rate in different positions within each occasion for\nthis experiment.\nThere is, on the other hand, a very marked position effect in Experiment\nIIb in which it was found that the first run of each occasion was the only\none- which was scoring significantly above mean chance expectation.\nThe results of the three runs for this experiment are shown in Table 10,\nwith the omission of twelve runs towards the end of the experiment which\nwere done with only one run per session.\nTable id\nDevn. from\nRun Falls Hits m.c.e.

Taking into account the fact\nthat it is the selected best of three sets of observations, the odds against a\ndeviation of this size occurring by chance is about 1,000 to i. The signifi-\ncance of this position effect may also be estimated by the method used for\nExperiment IIa. The variance of these run totals about their mean of\n140 is 507 which is 4-42 times the expected value of 114-6. This ratio\nis clearly significant, with odds against chance occurrence of rather less\nthan 100 to I.\nThere is, therefore, strong evidence for the reality of the position\neffect in Experiment lie although there appears to be none in Experiment\nIIa. I am not able to account for the difference between these two\nexperiments. It must be remembered that each run in IIb included all\nsix target faces so that explanations alternative to that of a higher tendency\nto score in the first run of each occasion are excluded as effectively in this\nexperiment as they are by the Latin square arrangement of targets in IIa.\nAnother oddity in scoring which has been sometimes reported is that\nof preferential scoring on certain target faces. Generally what has been\nsuggested is a preference for scoring on the six face but in many cases the\ndesign of the experiment has been such that a preferential scoring ten-\ndency cannot be distinguished from the effect of bias.\nThe results of Experiment IIa were analysed in order to discover\nwhether they showed any evidence for a tendency to score more heavily\non some targets than on others. It is obvious that it is not sufficient to\nfind that there are more hits on some faces than on others since this might\nbe due simply to the fact that these faces fell uppermost most frequently.\nThe comparison that must be made is between the number of hits on each\ntarget with the number expected on the hypothesis that the number of\n' Calculated from the formula Npq, p and q being the observed proportions of\nhits and misses in the experiment.\n\f179] A Report on Psycho-kinesis with Dice 121\nhits is proportional to the number of times that that face fell uppermost.\nThe results on different targets are shown in Table 11.\nTable i i\nTargets I ^ J T r 6 Total\nFalls -\n471 441 306 403 44Q\nI r y 430 2592\nHits\u2014observed 77 90 73 74 97 63 474\nexpected 86-5 8o-6 72-4 737 82-15 78-65 474\nMisses\u2014observed 396 351 323 329 352 367 2118\nexpected 386-5 360-4 323-6 329-3 366-85 351-35 2118\nDevn. of hits from\nexpn. - -9-5 + 9-4 +-6 +-3 + 14-85 -15-65\nThis table suggests that scoring is above average on 2s and 5s, below\naverage on is and 6s and intermediate on 3s and 4s. If instead of asking\nhow scoring on different target faces compares with average scoring, we\nconsider how it compares with the number of hits on each target face to be\nexpected by chance (i.e. one sixth of the number of falls with that face\nuppermost), w-e have the result shown in Table 12.\nTable 12\nTargets - - i 2 3 4 5 6 Total\nHits - - 77 90 73 74 97 63 474\nChance expn. - 78-8 73-5 66-o 67-2 74-8 71-7 432\nDeviation from\nchance expn. -i-8 +16-5 +7-0 +6-8 +22-2 -8-7\nIt appears from Table 12 that the main part of the scoring was done on\n2s and 5s whereas that on is and 6s was insignificantly below mean chance\nexpectation and that on 3 s and 4s was insignificantly above.\nWhether this was a real difference in scoring rate on different target\nfaces or a mere chance effect must be determined by finding the signifi-\ncance of the deviation from expectation shown in Table 11. For this\ntable chi'^ is 9-78, which with 5 degrees of freedom gives P = -o8. This is\nnot small enough to be ground for regarding the deviation from expecta-\ntion as significant. On the other hand, it is near enough to significance\nto make one hesitant to draw the conclusion that there is no sign of target\npreference. If we group together the hits on faces which are opposites, we\nfind a deviation from expectation which is highly significant. Thus by\ncombining the first and sixth columns of Table 11, the second and fifth,\nand the third and fourth columns, we get a contingency table with two\ndegrees of freedom showing deviations from expectation of -25-15,\n+ 24-15 and + -9 for these three pairs of targets respectively. If the data\nare treated in this way, the deviation from the values expected on the\nhypothesis of equal likelihood of scoring on each target would appear to\nbe clearly significant since chi2 = 9-i2 and P = -oi.\nThis indication of significance must, of course, be treated with some\ncaution since the low value of P results from the particular method adopted\nof pairing the targets. If it were merely the result of arbitrarily pairing\ntargets with similar scoring tendencies, it would be necessary to discard\nit altogether. The method of pairing is not, however, altogether arbi-\n\f122 Robert H. Thouless [Part\ntrary. The target faces paired together are not only those occupying\nopposite sides of the dice ;\nthey are also the faces that are similarly\ncoloured. In the dice I am using the 2 and 5 faces have red spots, the\n3 and 4 faces have blue spots, while the i and 6 faces have black spots.\nThe scoring preference may be for a particular colour of face and not for\na particular number.\nWhile the above indications cannot in themselves be regarded as\nsufficient evidence for target preference, they may be accepted as giving\na lead to further enquiry. I made, therefore, a similar analysis of the hits\nin Experiment IIb. The results are shown in Table 13.\nTable 13\nTargets - - - - - I & 6 2 & 5 3 &4 Total\nFalls . - - - - 867 884 841 2592\nHits\u2014observed - - - - 153 167 145 465\nexpected - - - - 155-5 158-6 150-9 465\nMisses\u2014observed - 714 717 696 2127\nexpected - 711-5 725-4 690-1 2127\nDevn. of hits from expn. - -2-5 + 8-4 -5-9\nAlthough the deviations from expectation in this table are in a some-\nwhat similar pattern to that found in Experiment IIa, they are quite\ninsignificant (chi'- = -87, P>-5). They do not, therefore, add anything\nto the somewhat inconclusive evidence as to target preferences given by\nIIa. It would, of course, have been possible to make a more extensive\nsearch for target preference in the experiments of series I. Counting\ntarget falls and hits is, however, very time consuming and I felt that I had\nspent enough time on a very minor problem. The situation at present\nis, therefore, that there is some evidence of target preference with\nheaviest scoring on 2S and 5s, but that the evidence is by no means\nconclusive.\nVI. Favourable and unfavourable conditions for PK experimentation.\nOne of the objects of this series of experiments was to see whether I\ncould find out anything about conditions which determined success or\nfailure in PK experimentation. I was looking out for any hints that my\nexperiments might give me, and the tentative conclusions I wish to report\nare often based on very incomplete evidence. I shall indicate this by\nusing phrases which indicate incomplete conviction ; where the evidence\nis reasonably good, that fact will be mentioned, but I wish to make it clear\nthat I am not confining myself to reporting conclusions that I regard as\nestablished. Rather they are more or less tentative conclusions which\nmust be tested out by later research. It was my impression that PK\nsuccess was more afi^ected by unfavourable conditions than is ESP success,\nthat inhibition is more easily set up, and that success can only be expected\nif a good deal more attention is paid to the problem of securing optimal\nconditions than is necessary when experimenting with the more stable\nESP processes.\nThe problems of conditions may be discussed under the following\nheads :\n\f179] A Report on Psycho-kinesis with Dice 123\n(i) Motivation.\n(ii) Time of day.\n(iii) Chronological decline.\n(iv) Total length of experiment.\n(v) Length of each experimental occasion.\n(vi) Induction of favourable psychological conditions.\n(i) Motivation. It has always been my impression that in both ESP\nand PK experiments on myself, effort to achieve the required result\ndefeats its own end and tends to produce failure. Too strong motivation\ntends to result in effort and failure results. That some degree of motiva-\ntion must be present seems likely but it must remain at a low level. Strong\nanxiety to succeed seems to militate against success. I have no convincing\nproof of this, but it is an impression gained by many indications. Effortless\nintention to succeed seems to me to be the ideal attitude. The way in\nwhich I have sometimes expressed this is that the attitude must be that\nexpressed by the words :\n\" I want to succeed but I don't really care\nwhether I do or not.\"\nA playful attitude towards the experiments is favourable to this relaxed\nmotivation. At the end of December 1948, I started doing PK experi-\nments in competition with my son and other members of my family. The\nresults of these competitions (for myself alone) are included in Experi-\nment I. The rate of scoring was considerably higher than I was at that time\ngetting when working alone. It might be supposed that making PK into a\ncompetitive game would intensify motivation rather than reduce it. For a\nchild it might do so, but for an adult the desire to win in a game is a far\nless strong motive than to get a positive result in a scientific experiment.\nIt is true that the latter motive was still present but it was largely sup-\npressed by the more trivial motive of winning the game. Under these\nconditions I felt that effort was relaxed and I succeeded better. But a\ncrisis in the game inducing effort could again reduce the score. For\nexample, in my first game with my son in which we threw in turn a set of\nthree runs (72 falls) equally divided between the six targets, we both\nobtained a score of 16 above mean chance expectation at the end of\n9 turns {27 runs). This is a pretty good rate of scoring for a PK experi-\nment. Then we decided to settle the game by throwing until one was\ntwo ahead. This immediately produced a state of increased volitional\ntension and, for the next turn, I scored three below expectation while he\nscored two below chance expectation (the first time we had both scored\nnegatively).\nThe same result appears to be produced by anxiety as to the total result.\nOn one occasion I made alone a series of 27 runs with an equal number on\neach target face without paying any attention to my total score. Then I\nadded up my score and found it was 17 above mean chance expectation.\nThen I felt that this was fine and I must keep it up ; in other words\nvolitional tension was increased. I immediately made another series of\n27 runs and scored 7 below mean chance expectation.\nThese are mere indications of no great evidential value but they are\nexamples of the kind of observation which makes me inclined to think that\nrelaxation of volitional tension is necessary to success. They suggest that\nit may be w^orth while for experimenters who wish to get success to try to\n\f124 Robert H. Thouless [Part\nmake their attitude towards their experiments rather playful than over-\nearnest. Competitive scoring may be a good way to achieve this end.\nThere is nothing original about this suggestion ; the value of a playful\nattitude has been suggested both by Professor Rhine and Dr Humphrey.\nIt also suggests that it is well to avoid being anxious about the result.\nThe best way of experimenting may be to predetermine the total length of\nan experiment and then not to work out total results until the experiment\nis completed. It is hard to deny oneself the satisfaction of seeing how the\nexperiment is going on, and I do not observe this principle myself, although\nI believe it is the best way. It is also to be considered that self-experi-\nmentation is particularly unfavourable to a care-free attitude towards\nexperimental results, since a subject who is also the experimenter cannot\nfail to be anxious about the total result. On the other hand, this may not\nbe important since it is possible that anxiety and volitional stress on the\npart of the experimenter may interfere with successful results however\ncare-free the subject may be.\n(ii) Time of day. On three days during the time when I was doing both\nexperiments IIa and IIb [i.e. the Latin square and the experiments),\nI did the experiment both in the morning and the late afternoon of the\nsame day. The combined results for the two experiments shows a startling\nsuperiority for the morning sessions. In every one of the six comparisons,\nthe morning session showed a higher score and the total result was that\nshown in Table 14, showing a clearly significant superiority for the total\nmorning score.\nTable 14\nFalls Hits Devil. S.E. C.R. P.\nMorning - 432 95 + 23 774 2-98 003\nAfternoon - - 432 66 -6 774 \u202278 \u202244\nDifference -\n29 29 IO-95 2-65 \u2022008\nI was inclined at first to attribute this difference to having done the\nexperiment twice in the same day, but it is more likely that it is due to the\ndifTerence in the time of day, since it is found in a later experiment (not\nyet completed) in which afternoon experiments were done on different\ndays from morning ones. In this experiment too there is a superiority of\nthe results of morning experiments over afternoon experiments although\nthose done in the evening are also better than afternoon ones.\nThe suggestion that experiments should preferably be done in the\nmorning may seem a not very practical piece of advice for those whose\noccupation takes them away from home early in the day. For most\npeople, however, it would be possible to devote half an hour to experi-\nmenting on Sunday mornings and it must be remembered that a short\nseries of experiments under optimal conditions may give a better result\nthan a long series under less favourable conditions with less total expendi-\nture of time.\nIt will be seen, for example, from Table 15, in which I compare the\ntotal results of my Experiments IIa and IIb with those obtained when the\nexperiment was done earlier than 12 noon, that I obtained a more signifi-\ncant total deviation from these morning experiments than I did from the\ncomplete series. If, therefore, I had confined myself to morning experi-\n\f179] A Report on Psycho-kinesis with Dice 125\nmeriting, it looks as if I should have got a more satisfactory result with the\nexpenditure of about two thirds of the experimental time.\nTable 15\nFalls Hits Devn.

In the course of a PK experiment (as in an\nESP experiment) a process of inhibition sets in which reduces scoring rate\n10 20 30 40 50 60\nOCCAS\/ONS\nFig. 2. \u2014Cumulative totals of Experiments IIa, IIb and Ix at end of each experi-\nmental occasion.\nA.

Thouless [Part\nand which apparently may go on to a point at which the subject is scoring\nsignificantly below chance expectation. An experiment may, of course, be\ndesigned in which this process of decline is itself the object of study. To\nan investigator wishing to obtain a positive deviation, however, decline is\nmerely a nusiance and much of the detail of experimental design (spacing\nof experiments, length of experimental occasions, etc.) is directed by an\nattempt to minimise this decline.\nOn each occasion, the total score obtained up to and including that\noccasion is plotted. The height of the graph shows, therefore, the cumu-\nlative total for that experiment, while the difference between two successive\nplots shows the score (deviation from chance expectation) on that occasion.\nI'' was an experiment with hand-thrown dice at targets determined by a\nLatin square. I had been doing a good deal of this experiment and it was\nalready thoroughly inhibited ;\nnothing but chance results were obtained.\nExperiment IIa, started at the same time, was in a form I had not been\nrecently using. Target determination was the same as in but the dice\nwere machine thrown. Positive scoring started at once but chronological\ndecline appears to set in on about the fifth occasion and the scoring\ncontinued predominantly negative until a novel feature (the recitation of\npoetry) was introduced at the point marked A. Thereafter, scoring was\nheavily positive until the thirty-first occasion when there are again indica-\ntions of the onset of chronological decline, although the experiment came\nto a predetermined end (at the thirty-sixth occasion) too soon after this for\nany certainty that this decline was final. IIb was also a novel form of\nexperiment started when I'^ came to an end. The experiment had\nbeen done previously with hand-thrown dice but not (as here) with\nmachine-thrown dice. Again it started off with positive scoring which was\nmaintained until the twenty-third occasion of this experiment. After\nthis point, nothing was added to the score although there is some indication\nof an end spurt. This, however, may be merely a temporary consequence\nof having made an unfavourable modification of the experiment between\nthe points D and E.\nThese observations suggest that at least some part of the decline effect\nmay not be general, affecting all types of PK performance, but specific to\nthe particular task whose repetition has produced the inhibition. If this\nis the case, an improved score may be expected if the subject is switched\nto another task. 1 found other indications of this specificity of the decline\neffect. For example, on 3\/1\/49 during the course of Experiment I, I did\nsix runs of a help-hinder experiment with a score of three below mean\nchance expectation. This was a familiar experiment. On the same day I\nstarted an entirely new experiment, the form of experiment, and scored\na positive deviation of + 8 for fifteen runs. On the following day, I con-\ntinued at about this rate of scoring for the but was still below mean\nchance expectation for the help-hinder experiment. There seems here to\nbe a strong indication that an inhibition of success resulting from continued\napplication to one kind of experiment may not inhibit scoring in another\nform of experiment.\nThe difference between two forms of experiment need not be large in\norder to show this difference between degree of inhibition. In a series of\nWy experiments reported in the Journal of Parapsychology,^ I found that I\n\f179] A Report on Psycho-kinesis with Dice 127\ngot consistently negative scoring in a DT experiment which I had used\nmany times before, chance scoring in a precognition experiment which I\nhad done less frequently before, and consistently positive scoring in a\nslightly different form of precognition experiment which I had never done\nbefore.\nThis shows the danger of concluding that one experimental method is\nintrinsically more fruitful than another from the fact that it gives a better\nscore when one starts using it. This may only mean that it is less inhibited\nbecause more novel. The practical suggestion emerging from this obser-\nvation is that it may be a help towards overcoming the effect of decline to\nhave a variety of tests rather than to use one only. There are a good many\npossibilities : the subject may throw for a series of pre-determined targets\nworking alone, he may do so in competition with someone else, he may\ndo my experiment, or he may do one of the variety of experiments\ndescribed in Dr Humphrey's useful handbook.^ Alternation of a variety\nof the available techniques is likely to give a higher score than the attempt\nto repeat a large number of times a single form of experiment.\n(iv) Total length of experiment. The fact of the onset of chronological\ndecline sets a limit to the total length of experiment which it is profitable\nto carry out with any one subject. It is impossible to make any definite\nrules on this matter since it is clear that different subjects differ very much\nin the degree to which they are affected by chronological decline. For\nexample, Dr Soal's first subject Mr Shackleton seems to have carried on\na single experiment to a very great length without serious falling off of\nscore.** If my own results may be taken as a general guide, it looks as\nif about 30 experimental occasions for any one experiment were enough.\nBoth my IIa and IIb experiments went on for 36 occasions and reference\nto Fig. 2 showing cumulative totals for these experiments suggests that\nboth went on rather too long for maximum significance. Even this length\nmay have only been possible because each session was a short one (3 runs\nof 24 falls). It is obvious that further research is necessary before one can\nmake a general rule as to the optimal length of experiment. Provisionally\none may consider about 60-90 runs as a length unlikely to produce serious\nchronological decline. The main point for experimenters to bear in mind\nis that there is an optimal length beyond which one should not go in\ntesting any one subject with one test and that it is more economical to\nmake a series less than this optimal length than to have it too long.\n(v) Length of each experimental occasion. In the effort to make as\nmuch use as possible of each occasion on which the subject comes, the\nexperimenter is tempted to give him as many tests as possible on each\noccasion. My experiments suggest that this is not an economical pro-\ncedure. In the Series I, I worked for an hour or more on each occasion and\nsucceeded in inducing a considerable decline after a few occasions on\neach experiment. It is true that these few occasions included a large\nnumber of falls, but I hoped to be able to work more economically by\ncutting down the amount of experimentation on each occasion. In\nExperiment II, I had only three runs of each experiment on any one\noccasion, although for the early part of the series two experiments of this\nlength were performed on each occasion. When IIa was finished and I\nwas doing IIb alone, I was doing only three runs on each occasion.\n\f128 Robert H. Thouless [Part\nI then noticed a fact which made me wonder whether even this was not too\nlong. When I had completed the twenty-eighth occasion of IIb I discovered\nthat all my scoring up to date had been on the first run of each occasion.\nThe totals for the first, second and third runs of each occasion showed\ndeviations from mean chance expectation of +31, - 5 and - i respectively.\nWhile there was no positive deviation on the second and third runs, the\nscore on the first run was highly significant. Taking into account the fact\nthat this was not a single observation but the selected best of three, the\nodds against so large a deviation occurring by chance are about 250 to i.\nFor this run alone the mean scoring rate is the very satisfactory amount of\nrather better than + 1 per run. It seemed, therefore, that it would be\nmore economical to cut down the length of each occasion to a single run.\nThis was done on the next 12 occasions with the disappointing result\nthat these 12 occasions gave a total score of 45 hits, three less than mean\nchance expectation. Reducing the length of occasion from three runs to\none did not, therefore, result in the expected improvement in score. I do\nnot understand why this was ; it appears as if the superiority of the first\nrun depends on the intention to carry out two more runs afterwards. In a\nsense, it may be considered that the logic underlying my expectation was\nfaulty. I considered that in replacing three runs by one, I was doing the\nfirst run and leaving out the second two ; it could be argued that I might\nas well have considered that I was doing the last one and leaving out the\nfirst two. The failure to get a satisfactory score on one run was not due to\na general inhibition due to chronological decline since the remaining four\noccasions of this experiment showed a deviation of +7 on the first run,\nof + 4 on the second run, and of o on the third run. Although the numbers\nare too small for statistical significance, the indication is that positive\nscoring was resumed and (less strongly) that the old pattern of scoring\npredominantly on the first run was resumed.\nI feel no very strong conviction of the superiority of short experimental\nsessions on each occasion. Clearly chronological decline does set in even\nwith an experimental session as short as the one I used in Experiment II\nand I have no clear indication that it does not set in as soon, when measured\nin terms of total experimenting, when the sessions are short as when they\nare long. I am still inclined to favour the short session and my present\npractice is to have not more than six runs of all experiments together for\neach experimental session. Further research is, however, necessary to\nestablish whether this is really an economical procedure.\n(vi) Induction of favourable psychological conditions. All Psi pheno-\nmena depend to a very large extent on the psychological condition of the\nsubject ; I am inclined to think that the performance of PK tasks is more\neasily upset by unfavourable psychological conditions than that of ESP\ntasks. In self-experimenting, it has seemed to me that I have not scored\nwell either on ESP or PK if I am tired, cross, ill or anxious. In experi-\nmenting with other subjects I have noticed that positive results tend to\ndisappear if there is any hint of a hostile or suspicious attitude on the part\nof those present or if tension is increased by over-emphasis on experi-\nmental precautions. These, of course, must be adequate but the rule\nshould be : adequate precautions without fuss. If witnesses are present,\ntheir attitude should be that of co-operative friendliness.\n\f179] A Report on Psycho-kinesis with Dice 129\nIt is easy to avoid experimenting when the subject is ill, cross or tired.\nAnxiety is more troublesome since there is always present a situation to\nbecome anxious about\u2014the success of the experiments. Possible ways of\ndealing with this source of anxiety have been discussed earlier.\nAs well as trying to avoid these obvious sources of unfavourable con-\nditions for positive scoring, we may consider whether there is any technique\nthat can be used for inducing a psychological condition favourable to\npositive scoring. It would be ideal if we could find a method which led to\nconsistent positive scoring without chronological decline. I can report\nonly very limited success in the search for such a method. My only\nsuccess in inducing a state of mind which seemed temporarily at least, to\nhave a real effect of scoring rate, was when during experiment IIa I hit on\nthe device of repeating poetry to myself while the experiment went on.\nThe point at which this device was introduced is shown by the line A on\nFig. 2. The immediate effects were striking. The deviations for the first\nsix occasions after this method was adopted were o, +5, +3, +2, +1, +8\nwith the total deviation of + 19 for 18 runs (i.e., 432 single die falls). The\nprevious six occasions had given scores: -i, -4, -1,0, +2, -5,\ntotalling - 9. The difference of + 28 in favour of the deviations after the\nchange of method is significant (C.i?. = 2-56, P = -oi).\nThis looked good and I thought I had discovered a method of over-\ncoming the problem of low scoring. This hope was not fulfilled. That\nthe method is not adequate to overcome the inhibition due to chronological\ndecline is shown by the fact that it did not affect at all my rate of scoring\nin the thoroughly inhibited hand-thrown series going on at the same time.\nMoreover, even the series IIa showed distinct evidence of chronological\ndecline in its later stages although the recitation of poetry went on all the\ntime. I continued this method to the end of Experiment IIb although I was\ndoubtful then whether it was having any useful effect. In experiments car-\nried on later than those reported here I have used it only occasionally with\nno clear indication that it now makes any difTerence one way or the other.\nIt may well be that the initial success of the method was due not to any\nspecific effect of the poetry but rather to the fact that it was a novelty ;\nit may have been another example of an inhibition to a particular form of a\ntest having been overcome by a change in the test. It may, on the other\nhand, have been due to the fact that the change in psychological attitude\ninduced by the poetry at the beginning was no longer induced later on.\nI am inclined to think that both factors may have been operative. Cer-\ntainly the experience of exaltation brought about by the poetry at the\nbeginning was not maintained. It soon came to be part of the rather\nboring routine of the test, no more exciting then would have been the\nrecitation of the alphabet.\nIt does, however, suggest a principle of experimenting worth trying out\nin order to help positive scoring. It may be worth while to try all kinds of\nemotionally stimulating stimuli such as music, discussion, problem\nsolving, etc. before or during the test, varying these so that none of them\nbecome a merely accustomed routine. I have no doubt that different\nconditions may be effective for different subjects. The tense atmosphere\nof the hushed experimental room is likely, on the whole, to prove un-\nfavourable for most of them.\n\f130 Robert H. Thouless [Part 179]\nVII. Conclusion.\nIt is obvious that, even at the end of my experiments, I was very far\nfrom having solved the problem of how to ensure success. That is clear\nfrom the low rate of scoring I had reached at the end. One would like\nto be able to describe conditions which would ensure that any\nexperimenter could get successful results by adhering to them. That is\nnot possible even for ESP experimentation, and it is my impression that\nsuccessful PK experimenting is more difficult, since the effect seems more\nquickly inhibited by continued experimentation and more easily affected\nadversely by unfavourable psychological conditions. It is not, therefore,\na matter for surprise if other experimenters do not always succeed in\ngetting successful results.\nThere are, however, clear indications of certain things that they should\navoid. One must avoid increasing the emotional tension of the subject by\nshowing gratification at his success and disappointment at his failure. One\nmust not introduce an atmosphere of tension by maintaining silence\nduring sessions. If witnesses are present they must not be allowed to\ncreate tension by maintaining a suspicious attitude or by such behaviour\nas whispering. The subject should not be required to do large numbers\nof experiments at a time or to do a sufficient total number of sessions to\nmake him exasperated by the experiment. A single experiment should\nnot be repeated without variation throughout the experimental series.\nThe satisfactoriness of an experimental design should be judged, at least\nin part, by the extent to which it avoids all of these unfavourable\nconditions.\nREFERENCES.\n' \" The Psychokinetic Effect.

Soal\n{Presidential Address delivered at a General Meeting of the Society on\n3 November 1950)\nI WOULD first express my sincere appreciation of the honour you have\nconferred upon me in making me your President. Many of my pre-\ndecessors in this office have been men eminent in Science, Literature or\nPhilosophy. I can only claim that my training has been that of a pure\nmathematician, and at present mathematics plays the useful though sub-\nsidiary role of informing us how likely it is that the coincidences we observe\ncan be accounted for by the operation of chance. But it is conceivable\nthat mathematics may one day become the language of mental relations\nas it is already the language of the physical sciences. Perhaps the small\nprogress which psychology has made during the past hundred years in\ncomparison with the gigantic strides taken by physics and chemistry may\nbe due in no small measure to the fact that we have failed so far to\ndiscover a calculus which is appropriate for dealing with the phenomena\nof mental life. However that may be there is truth in Dr Rhine's paradox\nthat today we know more about the atom than about the mind which\nconceived the atom. Psychology remains a rudimentary science and we\nare woefully ignorant of the working of those higher level functions which\nexpress themselves in creative activity of various kinds. And it would\nappear that the phenomena of psychical research are more intimately\nlinked with the unconscious or subconscious strivings of the mind than\nwith the conscious aspects studied by classical psychology.\nI need hardly remind you that the term psychical research itself has very\nwide connotations, and has been held by many investigators to mean the\nexamination of any unusual happening which does not appear to conform\nto a normal scientific explanation. When I was a member of that now-\ndefunct body the University of London Council for Psychical Investigation\nwe were asked to examine the most diverse and fantastic claims. One man\nasserted that he was able to generate an abnormal amount of heat in his\nhands, but a physicist with a thermopile quickly disposed of this claim.\nAnother man, a Kashmiri, alleged that when his eye-sockets were stopped\nwith dough and bandaged he was yet able to see to read through the nasal\nmucosa, that is, the inside membrane of his nose. Though this man put\nup a good show it soon became clear that he was seeing down the outside\nof his nose instead of the inside.\n131\n\f132 Di- S. G. Soal [Part\nThen there was the alleged talking mongoose Jeff who was the famihar\nof a sheep farmer and his wife and daughter who dwelt in a wooden frame\nhouse on a windswept upland of the Isle of Man. Unfortunately the\ninvestigators arrived at the lonely steading only to learn that Jeff had most\ninconsiderately left for a month's holiday.\nThough such investigations may have some possible psychological\nvalue as providing material for studies in motivation, they involve a dis-\npersal of time and energy and I cannot help feeling that psychical re-\nsearchers would do well to restrict themselves to the study of those types\nof phenomena for which there is a respectable amount of good evidence.\nI mean by these the problem of extrasensory perception in its various\naspects and the study of psycho-kinesis initiated by the workers at Duke\nUniversity. This programme would also naturally include the observa-\ntional study of spontaneous cases and the phenomena produced by those\nremarkable persons known as mediums. Hypnotism and the study of\nmultiple personality come also within the proper province of psychical\nresearch.\nOn the other hand we must never forget that psychical research is a\nfield of infinite possibilities. We must be prepared to gamble and take\nlong shots. Who knows, for instance if ESP is confined to human beings\nand animals? An experiment worth trying would be to pit against each\nother two electronic selectors generating choices of, say, four symbols\nand observe if there were more coincidences than chance would predict.\nIt is conceivable that the machines might \" telepath \" to each other. Such\nan experiment might be unsuccessful but it would not be silly.\nBut do not let us fritter away our time on the feats of stage telepathists\nand other illusionists. These persons are able to simulate extrasensory\nperception only because they work under their own carefully planned\nconditions. They are unmasked very quickly when asked to produce\ntheir effects under the normal experimental conditions of the parapsycho-\nlogical laboratory. The genuine telepathic subject is readily distinguished\nfrom the charlatan. The former submits without demur to any reasonable\nconditions which the experimenter may think fit to impose. The charla-\ntan always begins by telling the experimenter in minute detail just how the\ntest is to be conducted. The slightest deviation from his prescribed\nroutine is liable to upset all his calculations. That is why stage tele-\npathists generally refuse to permit examination of their claims by psy-\nchical research workers.\nThere are some who maintain that the best way to convince scientific men\nof the reality of telepathy is to go on demonstrating under increasingly\nrigid controls and to more and more witnesses the basic fact of extra-\nsensory perception. This, I think, is a mistaken policy. One might,\nit is true, succeed by such methods in convincing a few individual scientists\nbut the majority who had not seen the demonstrations would remain\nunaffected by them. And of those who witnessed them a certain pro-\nportion would prefer to believe it had been hoodwinked by some trickery\nthan be compelled to abandon the outlook of a lifetime.\nA wiser method would be to encourage young psychologists and others,\nby means of grants, to experiment for themselves, more especially with a\n\fi8o] Some Aspects of Extrasensory Perception 133\nview to discovering the mental and bodily factors which facilitate the\nemergence of telepathic or clairvoyant impressions, as well as the psycho-\nlogical types that are most successful as percipients, as agents and as\nexperimenters. It is only by asking useful questions and devising careful\nexperiments which provide the answers that we may hope at our present\nstage to make any real progress. To go on repeating the same experiment\nwould be like trying to study electricity by continually stroking a piece of\nebonite with flannel. Nor is it reasonable to expect a man who has con-\nvinced himself over and over again by carefully controlled experiments of\nthe reality of telepathy to spend the bulk of his time and energy in trying\nto convince sceptics who have probably not given an hour's thought to the\nquestion in the whole of their lives.\nWhen we have reached the stage (and I think it is probably only a\nquestion of time) at which we are able to say to the ordinary scientific\nworker: \" Apply such and such psychological tests to a group of persons\nand by means of the results select your experimenters, agents, and subjects\nand you will be reasonably certain with a little perseverance of getting\nmoderately significant results,\" we shall have achieved something of more\nimportance than if we had convinced by demonstrations a dozen members\nof the Royal Society.\nThe study of the correlation between personality traits and ESP\nperformance so ably begun by the late Dr Stuart and continued by Dr\nHumphrey and Dr Schmeidler will require for its successful progress the\nco-operation of highly-trained psychologists. On this score I do not\nanticipate any serious difficulties so far as this country is concerned. We\nhave now in London at least two University colleges with psychology\ndepartments whose heads are sympathetic to our studies. In an age in\nwhich almost everyone is faced with the necessity of earning his living it\nwould be unreasonable to expect heads of psychology departments to\nencourage young post-graduate students to make psychical research a main\ninterest. But with financial assistance there seems no reason why a\nlimited amount of work in this field should not be carried out by students in\npsychology who possess the right temperament.\nTo sum up, it is my belief that a large number of well-controlled experi-\nments by independent investigators dealing with specific problems con-\nnected with extrasensory perception will have more influence upon\northodox scientific opinion than eff^orts, however rigorous, which are con-\nfined to a mere demonstration of the existence of the faculty. Indeed can\nit be said that one has succeeded in establishing completely any natural\nphenomenon until one knows something of the conditions in which it\ntakes place ? The best way then to convince ordinary men of science of the\nreality of telepathy is for as many workers as possible to do well-planned\nexperiments with the object of finding out something about the way in\nwhich it works.\nI would not, however, wish to give the impression that competent wit-\nnesses are unnecessary at experiments in extrasensory perception. They\nare indeed essential when the experimenters are young and inexperienced,\nand even in the case of investigators who are well acquainted with the\nvarious sources of error it is advisable for intelligent persons to be present\nin order to assist in the checking of records. Further, I think that when-\n\f134 Dr S. G. Soal [Part\never possible two experimenters should work together on an investigation.\nBut there is clearly no sense in creating an atmosphere in which every per-\nson is suspected of cheating or of being in collusion with someone else.\nI think it is fairly certain now that the getting of results in extrasensory\nperception depends not only on the percipient and the agent but also on the\ngeneral harmonious relations which exist among all the persons who take\npart in the experiment. As Professor Gardner Murphy would put it, the\nemergence of successful results is a function not only of individual\nmentalities but also of the intra-personal psychical field. When we have\ndiscovered a sensitive we must find a suitable group of persons to work\nwith him if his faculty is to have unobstructed play. I would not, however,\ngo so far as Professor Murphy who suggests (unless I have misunderstood\nhim) that a considerable percentage of the population could become Basil\nShackletons if only they were brought into contact with the right agents\nand experimenters, for I think this is too good to be true. I certainly\nbelieve that the powers of good subjects can be inhibited if the experi-\nmenters are uncongenial to them.\nThe reluctance of many men of science to accept the phenomena of\nextrasensory perception is largely the result of a misconception. It is\nassumed tacitly that there can be nothing in the Universe which does not\nobey the laws of physics as we know them today. I cannot see the least\njustification for this naive assumption. As Professor Broad has pointed\nout more than once, had it not been for the accident that certain substances\nsuch as lodestone and amber are fairly common on the earth's surface, we\nmight have known nothing at all about the existence of electromagnetic\nphenomena and it would have been supposed that the laws of Newtonian\nmechanics held throughout the Universe. Moreover, as Professor Hardy\nhas asserted, it is impossible to account for biological phenomena ade-\nquately in terms of physics and chemistry. Still less is it possible to\nexplain the complex diversity of consciousness and its creative activities in\nterms of present-day physics.\nWhen a physicist asserts categorically that there can be no such thing as\nextrasensory perception, he is simply making an illegitimate excursion\noutside his own province. The question of the existence of paranormal\nperception is to be settled on the adequacy of the evidence and on\nthat alone. Many eminent philosophers, biologists and psychologists\nhave expressed the judgement that the experimental evidence for, say,\ntelepathy is now adequate both as regards quality and quantity.\nNowadays there is very little criticism of the experimental evidence for\ntelepathy that need be taken seriously. More often than not the would-\nbe critic betrays the fact that he has not even taken the trouble to make\nhimself conversant with the published reports which he is presuming to\ncriticise. The general method adopted is to list a few of the well-known\nsources of error and then insinuate that all apparently successful cases of\nESP can be explained away as being due to the presence of one or more of\nthese flaws acting either singly or in combination. But there is no attempt\nto make the accusations specific ; the critic does not go through an actual\nscientific report and point out just where the errors lie in this particular\npiece of work. He confines himself to vague generalities. It is suggested\neven more vaguely that there is a \" will to believe on the part of the\n\fi8o] Some Aspects of Extrasensory Perception 135\ninvestigators \", in spite of the fact that some of the most successful experi-\nmenters were sceptics when they began their experimentation. In a recent\nletter to the New York Times Magazine a lady medico asserted that a pure\nmathematician would be prone to believe in mystical things like telepathy\nwhich have no existence in fact as a relief from his professional work which\nconsisted of hard logical abstractions! But how can the lady possibly know\nthat telepathy does not exist? The issue is prejudged without the slightest\nattempt to weigh up the evidence. A year ago the writer of a letter to The\nTimes stated that so-called telepathy was to be accounted for by supposing\nthat the agent and percipient had the same preference for colours, numbers,\netc. and common habits of mental association. He mentioned experiences\nof his own in support of this contention. It was as if Rip Van Winkle had\nsuddenly awakened after a sleep of thirty years to make a pronouncement\non telepathy! Yet the Editor printed this absurdity as though it were a\nserious contribution to the discussion.\nIt is certainly true to say that ninety-five per cent of present day\ncriticism of extrasensory perception is either uninformed criticism by\npersons who have never made any competent study of the experimental\nreports of the past thirty years or blind irrational prejudice by writers\nwho merely dislike the subject and its implications.\nEffective criticism of the card-guessing techniques ended about the year\n1940. By that time all sound objections had been adequately met by the\nexperimenters, and it seems very unlikely that any further weaknesses,\neither experimental or statistical, will be revealed. The mathematical\ncriticism was trivial from the very beginning but it was true that in some\nof the earlier experiments at Duke University sufficient care was not\ntaken to eliminate the possibility of sensory cues from the cards themselves.\nBut not one of the objections raised against the American experiments\ncould in the slightest degree apply to those done in England.\nLet us now turn to a recent critique of ESP entitled \"Rhine or Reason\"\nwhich appears in the autumn number of the Modern Quarterly, a\nMarxist Review. It is very significant that Marxism has begun to attack\nESP. Already the Communists in Russia have issued propaganda against\nDr Rhine, and now we have this bitter polemic against extrasensory\nperception appearing in an English Communist-inspired journal. It is\nwritten by John McLeish, who is Staff Tutor in Psychology at Leeds\nUniversity. Now in my view the most serious defect of this article is the\nauthor's obvious lack of up-to-date knowledge of his subject. Had this\ncritique been written in 1940 instead of in 1950 it would even then have\nbeen ineflFective but in the past decade so many careful reports on ESP\nhave been published, which the writer completely ignores, that his criticism\nis robbed of any value it might once have had.\nHe gives for instance an excellent popular discussion of the more\nordinary sources of error which aff'ect experiments in telepathy and clair-\nvoyance and a somewhat more superficial treatment of the statistical\naspects of card-guessing.\nBut there is no attempt whatever to show precisely how these different\nkinds of error could have vitiated, say, the Pearce-Pratt clairvoyance\nexperiments in which the experimenters and guesser were in different\n\f136 Dr S. G. Soal [Part\nbuildings of Duke University, or the Pratt-Woodruff series, or the very\ncarefully reported Martin and Stribic experiments at the University of\nColorado. Mr McLeish does not even mention the Martin and Stribic\nreport, or the classic picture-guessing experiment of Whately Carington, or\nthe Soal-Goldney report.\nIt is of course perfectly true that in certain of Dr Rhine's early experi-\nments insufficient care was taken to eliminate the possibility of sensory cues\nfrom the backs of the cards. It is also true, as the writer affirms, that the\nreporting of many of the experiments in Rhine's first book, Extra-\nsensory Perceptio)i, does not permit the reader to form any exact picture\nof the experimental procedure, but these facts are now universally ad-\nmitted by all competent parapsychologists. But these objections certainly\ndo not apply to many of the later investigations carried out by Rhine and\nhis disciples. So far as I am aware, there is not a single error of the\ntype mentioned by Mr McLeish that could have any possible bearing on\nsay the Whately Carington experiments, the Martin and Stribic series or\nthe Soal-Goldney experiments.\nTurning to my 1935-1939 experiments the author states that \" Dr\nSoal . . . although recognising the possible operation of some such me-\nchanism as '\nunconscious whispering '\nor changes in breathing, failed to\ntake the precautions necessary to exclude this factor except for warning\nthe agent about it \". Here the writer is clearly referring to my pre-\nliminary report, \" Fresh Light on Card Guessing : Some New Effects \",\nin which 160 subjects were tested. No precautions were taken to obviate\nthe possibility of unconscious whispering because the result of the in-\nvestigation was at the time judged to be entirely negative and had been\nnegative for some years. It was therefore thought unnecessary to make\nthe conditions any more stringent than they were. This was quite plainly\nstated in my report. The precognitive effects with two of the subjects\nwere only discovered long after the experiments were ended.\nBut surely what Mr McLeish has to explain away are the results of the\nSoal-Goldney report, \"Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy\" (1943),\nof whose very existence he seems to be unaware since he does not even\nmention it. He has to explain just how Basil Shackleton, seated in a\ndifferent room from the agent and guessing at the rate of 25 calls per\nminute could, over a period of two years, produce persistent precognitive\neffects by picking up \" unconscious whispers \" from the agent in the next\nroom with the door almost completely closed. It is a tall order\u2014especially\nto explain that precognitive effect which appeared week after week with\nthree different agents. I cannot even imagine any reasonable explanation\nin terms of \" changes in breathing \" or \" whispering \" on the part of the\nagent. Referring again, I suppose, to the preliminary 1940 report,\nMcLeish rather cryptically remarks that the tendency to displacement\n\" is probably to be explained by the differences in experimental technique\nwhich involve timing differences, rather than from the theory of subcon-\nscious time-lag or discrepancy favoured by Dr Soal \". I really do not know\nprecisely what this sentence means and I cannot believe that the author\nhas even read \"Experiments in Precognitive Telepathy\". The timing\nconditions of these Shackleton experiments as well as the whole experi-\nmental set-up were exactly similar to those of the 1945-1949 Stewart\n\fi8o] Some Aspects of Extrasensory Perception 137\nexperiments. The Shackleton series produced on the whole no signi-\nficant excess of hits on the \" target \" card but a highly significant excess on\nthe card one ahead of the target which in 11,000 guesses corresponded to\nodds of 10^^ to I against chance. On the other hand the main Stewart\nseries of over 37,000 trials gave a highly significant number of hits on the\nactual (target) card, corresponding to odds of more than loi\"\" to i, whereas\non the cards i and 2 places ahead of the target there was a deficiency of\ncorrect hits that was also very significant.\nIt would be very hard to explain these anomalies in terms of timing\ndifferences and they would present a formidable problem for the \" whisper-\ning \" hypothesis.\nNor does Mr McLeish appear to have read my Myers Memorial Lecture\nof 1947 in which a preliminary account of the Stewart experiments is\ngiven, for his only knowledge of these experiments seems to have been\nderived from a somewhat inadequate description of a single experiment\nwitnessed by the Science Editor of the News Chronicle. One does not\nin any case expect to find a scientific report of anything in a popular\ndaily newspaper and I can take no responsibility for the account printed as\nI had no opportunity for reading it through.\nMr McLeish writes : \"A closer examination of the experimental\nset-up would be necessary before Dr Soal's results can be accepted as\nevidence for the ESP hypothesis, especially in view of the fact that only\ntwo of his subjects\u2014working in their own homes or studios\u2014exhibited\nthe ability to guess the cards in a fashion better than chance would\nsuggest.\" But the experimental technique is well-known and has been\ndescribed in minute detail in the Soal-Goldney report, in Philosophy by\nProfessor Broad, in Penguin Science News 9 by Dr Dingwall and Mr Parsons,\nin my Myers Lecture and elsewhere. Psychologists, philosophers and other\nscientists have witnessed it in operation without being able to find flaws\nin it. During the past nine years it has been discussed from every angle\nand still resists all serious criticism as Dingwall and others have pointed\nout. But Mr McLeish appears to be unaware of all this.\nNor is it correct to insinuate that Shackleton and Mrs Stewart could\nonly produce their results in their own homes or studios. If Mr McLeish\nhad read the Soal-Goldney report he would have known that Shackleton\nproduced exactly the same effects when he was investigated at the rooms\nof the Society for Psychical Research in the presence of several persons\nwith scientific training and Mrs Stewart on more than one occasion\nproduced her most brilliant effects when shut up in the X-ray chamber of\nthe Royal Free Hospital.\nSince Mr McLeish makes \" unconscious whispering \" the spearhead of\nhis attack on telepathy it is surely strange that he is unaware of either the\nexperiments carried out by means of the telephone with Mrs Stewart and\nthe agent in houses 150 yards apart or of the much more important\nexperiments carried out in 1949 with the agents in London or Richmond\nand Mrs Stewart herself at Merksem near Antwerp. These last experi-\nments, conducted with the aid of carefully synchronised stop-watches,\nand the 7-p.m. time signal produced a degree of success on the target card\nwhich corresponded to odds of 10^ to i against chance. The successful\nresults obtained on six occasions at a distance of over 200 miles were of\n\f138 Dr S.G. Soal [Part\nprecisely the same order as those obtained when Mrs Stewart and the\nagent were in adjoining rooms at a distance of about 20 feet apart. I do\nnot know what Mr McLeish has to say about \" unconscious whispering\n\"\nor \" changes of breathing \" in connection with these experiments. If\n\" unconscious whispering \" is the probable explanation of telepathy there\nought to have been a complete collapse in the results when Mrs Stewart\nmigrated to Belgium!\nPublished reports of these experiments in detail were available to Mr\nMcLeish six or seven months ago but rather than seek them out he prefers\nto cling to the exploded hypothesis that telepathy can be accounted for by\nunconscious whispering.\nThe author's discussion of experiments in \" Pure Telepathy \" designed\nto exclude clairvoyance is completely out of date. He is of course correct\nin his assertion that experiments in which the agent makes up a sequence of\nsymbols in his head are vitiated by the fact that the guesser and the agent\nmay possess similar order-preferences. But nowadays no serious in-\nvestigator uses such methods whatever may have happened in the past.\nIn all modern experiments in \" Pure \" Telepathy a code is used by the\nagent of which there is no written or other physical record. The symbols\nto be transmitted are decoded mentally by means of a set of different\nsymbols arranged in random order. In attacking old experiments in\nwhich order-preferences and number preferences are not eliminated the\nwriter is simply flogging a dead horse. Quite obviously he is unfamiliar\nwith the experiment conducted by Mr Bateman and myself, and described\nin my Myers lecture which excluded not only clairvoyance in the present\nbut also the possibility of precognitive and retrocognitive clairvoyance.\nNor is there any mention of Miss McMahan's experiment on similar lines.\nThe writer asserts that \" one looks in vain, however, in Rhine's books\nfor the point-by-point discussion of the alternative views of particular\nexperiments which have been put forward with considerable fire in the\nliterature devoted to these problems \". But this is not true of Rhine's\nmost serious book. Extrasensory Perception After Sixty Years, a large\npart of which is devoted entirely to the discussion point by point of\nalternative hypotheses and their possible application to individual investi-\ngations.\nThe truth is that Mr McLeish is not sufficiently informed to make an\neffective criticism of extrasensory perception. He does not know the\nexperimental literature sufficiently well.\nIf one confines oneself to attacking weak experiments and ignores all\nthe really strong published reports it is quite easy to make out a case\nagainst ESP. One has only to describe a few of the ordinary sorts of\nerror to which experiments have been often subject and then insinuate\ncleverly that even if these particular sources of error do not apply to\ncertain experiments these may have been vitiated by other errors not\npostulated. But a quotation or two from Mr McLeish's article reveals\nonly too clearly that his real motivation in writing this ineffective critique\nis a fear of the consequences which may follow the acceptance of ESP.\nHe writes :\n\" If therefore we subject Rhine's claims and conclusions to a\ncloser examination, it is not because his views are inconsistent with\nmaterialism, but rather because the form in which they are expressed strikes\n\fi8o] Some Aspects of Extrasensory Perception 139\nat the root of psychological and other scientific experimentation. Rhine\nand his associates open the door to all sorts of incalculable forces, and his\ntheories make the practical procedures of the scientific investigator in\nlarge part meaningless. The fashionableness of ESP in scientific circles\nin Britain today represents a form of intellectual hara-kiri symptomatic of\na loss of nerve.\" Has it not occurred to Mr McLeish that the increasing\nattention which scientific men and philosophers are giving to ESP may\nhave quite a different explanation? I suggest that, as Aldous Huxley\nremarks, the evidence for extrasensory perception is growing so strong\nthat it can no longer be rejected. Or as Professor Hardy has proclaimed, it\ncan only be rejected by the intellectually dishonest, and, I might add, by the\nintellectually timid and fearful. Incidentally I do not think Mr McLeish\nneed worry about the possibility that ordinary psychological experiments\nmay be vitiated by the intrusion of telepathy. If such a thing happened it\nwould be of rare occurrence since the majority of people show only feeble\nevidence of telepathic powers or none at all. It is, however, quite probable\nthat the recognition of telepathy and precognition may require us to make\nprofound changes in our ordinary concepts of time and causation. But\nso far as the near future is concerned, the implications will be philosophical\nrather than practical.\nMr McLeish's critique abounds in misleading statements and half-\ntruths. He remarks that \" Coover, the Stanford University investigator,\ncame to a negative conclusion after a long investigation under laboratory\nconditions (19 17) and until his death resisted all attempts by others to\n'\ncook '\nhis resuhs \". But he carefully refrains from pointing out that on\nthe whole 10,000 trials conducted by Coover there were 294 correct hits\ninstead of the 250 expected by chance, and this excess, ignored by Coover\nhimself, corresponds to odds of 200 to i against the operation of chance.\nAs Professor Evelyn Hutchinson has remarked, papers are published every\nyear in biology which support hypotheses with no greater odds than this.\nIt was Coover himself who did the \"cooking\" by suppressing this fact,\nand not Professor Cyril Burt nor Dr Thouless nor Dr F. C. Schiller who\ndrew attention to it. Odds of 200 to i in an experiment may not be con-\nclusive but they are sufficient grounds for going on with the investigation,\nand Coover was too inert even to attempt to discover if there was any error\nin his experimental method.\nBut even had Coover's results been completely negative, the fact would\nhave been of little consequence. It would only have shown that by taking\n100 students at random one cannot be certain of finding a good telepathic\nsubject. I did thirteen times as much work as Coover before I discovered\ntwo persons of outstanding telepathic gifts.\nMr McLeish does not fly to that last resort of the sceptic and accuse the\ninvestigators of fraudulent practices, but he suggests that in some cases the\nsubjects may have been pulling the legs of the experimenters. Now while\nthis might happen in a poorly controlled experiment it could not easily\nhappen in, say, the recent Stewart experiments. For Mrs Stewart is\nseated in a different room from that containing the card-table and the\nagent. An experimenter sits beside her the whole time to see that she\ndoes not move from her place. She could only cheat if the agent or sender\nwere in collusion with her. But several of the agents v\/ith whom she\n\f140 Dr S. G. Soal [Part\nobtained most brilliant success were members of the staff of Queen Mary\nCollege whom she had never met until the hour of the experiment. Mrs\nStewart often did not even know the name of the person who was coming\nto act as agent. Moreover the card sequences were determined from\nlists of random numbers prepared by an experimenter a few hours before\nthe experiment.\nMr McLeish makes all sorts of suggestions as to what may happen, but\nhe makes no attempt to apply his theories to well-controlled investigations\nand demonstrate how his suggestions could have worked in practice.\nAgain he hints vaguely that there is an atmosphere of excitement and\nemotion prevalent at experiments in extrasensory perception. This is\nsimply not true of any experiments which I have attended and I have been\nengaged in such experiments for over twenty years. I am quite certain\nthat everyone who has been present at either a Shackleton or a Stewart\nexperiment would readily confirm that the whole procedure was humdrum\nand matter of fact from beginning to end. The results were not checked\nuntil the end of the experiment, and until then the subject did not know\nwhether he was doing well or badly.\nThis is the kind of discrediting insinuation which in serious experiments\nhas no basis in fact.\nIn support of his contention that the subjects themselves may be fooling\nthe experimenters the author appeals to the Piddington performance. But\nthe Piddingtons refuse scientific investigation and any competent experi-\nmenter could in half-an-hour satisfy himself that their results were not\nobtained by means of telepathy.\nIn certain circles we are constantly hearing rumours that a conjuror is\ngoing to duplicate the Shackleton experiments under similar conditions\nto those under which Shackleton worked. It is many years since the pro-\nect was first mooted and my latest information is that the conjurors\nhave not yet had sufficient practice but that matters are moving.\nI would respectfully suggest that before Mr McLeish writes another\ncritique of extrasensory perception he would do well to make himself\nmore perfectly acquainted with the extensive modern experimental\nliterature now in existence, for his present effort is at least ten years behind\nthe times.\nA very common remark about experiments in extrasensory perception\nis that the findings\u2014unlike those of physics and chemistry\u2014cannot be\nrepeated by other workers. But this stricture requires considerable\nqualification. It would be truer to say that experiments in telepathy are\ndifficult to repeat, and not that repetition is impossible. One reason is\nthat the investigator is in the position of a chemist who wants to make\nexperiments with some extremely rare element that is hard to obtain. In\nour case a human subject with high-grade extrasensory powers corre-\nsponds to the chemist's rare substance. In point of fact many of the\nfindings such as displacement phenomena in card or picture guessing\nhave been noted again and again by independent investigators, as I shall\nshow presently. The same is true of the decline effects first noted by Miss\nJephson and the negative scoring first discovered by Rhine.\nBut even were good telepathic subjects to become one day as common\n\fi8o] Some Aspects of Extrasensory Perception 141\nas they are now rare, we should not expect to obtain the precise verifica-\ntion of results that occurs in chemistry and physics. For mental pheno-\nmena, and more especially those connected with the higher-level functions\nof the mind, are extremely variable. So long as the psychologist restricts\nhimself to simple experiments in sense-perception, learning by rote and\nso on, in which the physiology of the nervous system plays a prominent\npart, the findings will show a certain uniformity because these phenomena\nare partly subject to physical causation. Experiments in physics can be\nexactly repeated because the results are statistical effects concerning the\naverage behaviour of immense numbers of elementary particles. One\ncannot say with any certainty what an individual electron is going to do.\nOne can of course make mass predictions about the average behaviour of a\nlarge group of human beings. If fifty thousand persons chosen at random\nare asked to write down a letter of the alphabet, we can prophesy with some\nconfidence that only a very small proportion will choose N, I, Y, or Z and\nthat letter A and the labials B, M, P will be the most popular. But no-one\ncan predict with any certainty the letter Tom Jones will select.\nPsychical research explores the deep-level aspects of human personality,\nand human beings are only in part subject to physical causation. Most\nmen believe that when faced with two alternative courses of action the\nconscious personality has the power to intervene and choose one of them.\nIf this belief is illusory, then clearly there can be no such thing as moral\nresponsibility. But if, as most of us believe, the power of conscious\nchoice is a reality and we are not automatons, this means that our conscious\nminds can initiate physical processes within our bodies. The Will\ntherefore is one aspect of human personality in which something that is\nnon-physical comes into operation, namely the trigger action of conscious\nchoice. We need not be surprised then to discover regions of the human\nmind where consciousness transcends time, space, and causality as we\nknow them in the physical world.\nPhysical phenomena are characterised by their uniformity and psycho-\nlogical phenomena by their uniqueness. As we pass from physics to\nbiology, thence to classical psychology, through psycho-therapy to\npsychical research we find an ever-lessening degree of repeatability in the\nresults of experiment. But though physics and psychical research are\nat opposite poles they are like two ships moving in different directions on\nthe same great circle and converging on the same objective. For both are\nleading us back to those fundamental problems of metaphysics which\nconcern the nature of time and causation and the relation of man's mind\nto the physical world. Physics deals with groups of sense-perceptions\nwhich can be fitted into a certain mathematical framework; psychical\nresearch with those deeper level processes of the mind which refuse to fit\ninto the framework. Both in their different ways bring us face to face with\nthe problem of the human observer and the nature of consciousness itself.\nAs Eddington has said, the footprints that we notice on the sands of the\nUniverse turn out in the end to be our own. Just as Eddington was led to\nadopt a thorough-going idealism in his attitude to physics, so I believe that\npsychical research will have to abandon the Cartesian dualism with which\nit started off and espouse an idealistic philosophy which postulates different\ngrades of mental substance that are capable of interacting with one another.\n\f142 Dr S. G. Soal [Part\nIt has sometimes been urged that parapsychology has a plethora of facts\nand not enough working hypotheses. I do not think however that we can\nhave too many facts, provided of course that they are well-substantiated.\nWhat the writer probably had in mind is that the facts are isolated and that\nwe have not yet discovered significant relations among them. In the his-\ntory of most sciences there is an intermediate phase between the collection\nof crude facts and the construction of fruitful hypotheses. This is the\nphase of systematisation and concise description in which isolated observa-\ntions are brought into relation with one another and masses of detail are\ncomprehended by some simple statement or formula. When Kepler\nfound that the multitudinous observations of Tycho Brahe on the positions\nof the planets were consistent with the supposition that each planet moved\nin an ellipse with the sun at a focus and that the radius joining the planet\nto the sun swept out equal areas in equal times, and that for different\nplanets the squares of the periodic times were proportional to the cubes of\nthe major axes, this concise description created order out of chaos and\npaved the way for Newton's great hypothesis. I would not for a moment\nsuggest that parapsychology is in sight of any such major clarification.\nBut in a smaller way there are signs that certain workers are searching for\nrelations among the facts of extrasensory perception. I have been much\nimpressed by a series of papers by Dr J. G. Pratt and Mrs Esther Bond\nFoster dealing with the phenomenon of displacement which have ap-\npeared in recent numbers of the Journal of Parapsychology. Displacement\noccurs when a card-guesser names correctly and with significant frequency\nthe card which is one or two places behind or ahead of the target card at\nwhich he is consciously aiming. If he scores significantly on the card one\nplace ahead of the target card this is known as ( + i) displacement ; if on\nthe card one place behind (\n- i) displacement. In the case where cards are\narranged in a pile at the beginning of the experiment and lifted off one by\none as they are guessed, there is no particular reason to suppose that the\n( + i) shift has anything to do with time. The displacement may be of\na purely spatial kind. In the case of Basil Shackleton ( + i) displacement\noccurred even when the card sequence was not in existence at the start of\nthe experiment but was determined during the test by a person who\nselected coloured counters from a bag or bowl by touch one after another.\nHere there are reasons for thinking that we were dealing with a displace-\nment into future or past time.\nThe earliest observation of displacement in card-guessing of which I\nhave any knowledge was made in 1938 by Dr C. G. Abbott, an astro-\nphysicist who was at one time Secretary to the Smithsonian Institution\nat Washington. Dr Abbott made a successful repetition of Rhine's card-\nguessing tests with the clairvoyance condition using himself as the subject.\nHe noticed that when he was feeling tired or run-down he failed to guess\ncorrectly the card at which he was aiming but that his guess was often\nright for the immediately preceding or following card. In 1949 Dr\nAbbott tested himself again with the Zener cards and reported quite\nsignificant ( + 1) and (-1) displacements, these being of about equal\nmagnitude. In 1940 Whately Carington published his classical paper on\npicture-guessing which produced evidence that when he pinned up a\ndifferent drawing in his study on each of ten consecutive evenings the\n\fi8o] Some Aspects of Extrasensory Perception 143\nsubjects in many cases got correct impressions, not of the sketch exhibited\non the night on which they made their drawing, but of the one pinned up by\nCarington a night or two earUer or later. Carington's work, as is well\nknown, led to the discovery that two of my own card-guessing subjects,\nMrs Gloria Stewart and Mr Basil Shackleton, had produced highly\nsignificant ( + 1) and (\n- i) displacements over a series of many hundred\nguesses. In a long series of further experiments carried out with Mr\nShackleton by Mrs K. M. Goldney and myself, he continued to produce\n( + 1) displacement with each of two agents and both ( + 1) and (-1)\ndisplacement with a third agent. When the rate of calling was speeded up\nto double the normal rate the (\u00b11) shift gave way to a (+2) shift. Since\nthe publication of our report on Precognitive Telepathy significant dis-\nplacement efliects have been recorded by several workers\u2014notably by\nThouless and Oram in England and by Birge, Bindrum, Abbott and Stuart\nin America. None of these effects, however, were comparable in magni-\ntude with those observed in the cases of Shackleton and Mrs Stewart.\nIn 1943 W. Russell re-examined for displacement five records by\nAmerican subjects who had produced high scores on the target card but\ndiscovered no evidence of displacement. Until the pubhcation of the new\nwork by Pratt and Foster the phenomenon of displacement appeared as an\noddity\u2014a queer exception to the rule that telepathic or clairvoyant\nsubjects in general hit the target at which they are aiming. In the work\ncarried out with Mrs Stewart from 1945-1949, however, F. Bateman and I\nobserved for the first time a new type of displacement which we have\ncalled \" negative \" displacement. This must not be confused with back-\nward or (\n- i) displacement. What happened was that Mrs Stewart\nshowed a significant tendency to choose certain of her guesses so as to\navoid scoring a hit on the card which immediately followed the target card\nor the card which immediately preceded it. That is to say she scored on\n( + I ) and (\n- I\n)\ntargets many less hits than even chance might be expected\nto produce. This avoidance extends also to about the same degree on\n( + 2) targets and to a lesser degree on (\n- 2) targets. On the actual target\nitself there is a very large positive score which on the main series of 37,100\ntrials amounts to over 25 standard deviations. Compared with this the\nnegative deviations on displacement targets are small though highly\nsignificant\u2014that is except in the case of the (\n- 2) deviation.\nOur first tentative explanation of these negative effects was to assume\nthat they were the result of subconscious motivation on the part of Mrs\nStewart. We had some reason to think that she was jealous of Shackleton\nand wished to avoid a slavish imitation of his positive displacement\nphenomena. As a consequence we assumed that some kind of censor in\nthe subconscious stationed itself at the gateway and inhibited guesses which\nwould be correct on the displacement targets from passing into her\nconscious mind.\nPratt and Foster have recently examined the original records of the\nextensive series of clairvoyance experiments carried out by Dorothy H.\nMartin and Frances Stribic at the University of Colorado prior to the\nyear 1938. These are among the best-controlled of American card-\nguessing experiments. Up to date Pratt and Foster have been concerned\nwith the work of Martin and Stribic's two best subjects known as D.W.\n\f144 Dr S. G. Soal [Part\nand C.J. Both these percipients, in the series studied, worked under\nsimilar conditions. A pack of 25 Zener cards was shuffled behind a screen\nand the subject guessed the order of the cards from top to bottom of the\npack which remained undisturbed till the guessing was complete. This\nis usually known as the DT (Down Through) method. Each subject ran\nthrough a shuffled pack about 300 times. The averages of correct hits on\nthe \" target \" card made by C.J. and D.W. were almost identical, these\nbeing 7.3 and 7.5 respectively for a pack of 25. These results are extremely\nsignificant. But Pratt and Foster have now disclosed a result which lay\nunsuspected for twelve years. They find that both D.W. and C.J. pro-\nduced very significant forward ( + 1) displacement of a negative kind.\nThat is, each tended to avoid scoring correct hits on the card which\nimmediately followed the target card. In the case of D.W. the overall\n( + i) negative displacement amounts to 3.36 standard deviations but with\nC.J. it reaches the high figure of 9.1 standard deviations. The odds\nagainst chance corresponding to the last result are of the order 10^* to i\nand C.J.'s record constitutes the most remarkable case of displacement\nencountered since Shackleton. In making these estimates the high scoring\non the target card in conjunction with the fact that Martin and Stribic\nused packs containing five cards of each symbol have been taken into\naccount. The over-all backward (\n- i\n)\ndisplacement scores for these\nsubjects are normal, that is what would be expected by chance.\nBut the most fascinating find of Pratt and Foster is the discovery that this\ntendency to avoid the card one place ahead is not an efl^ect which is ran-\ndomly or indifferently distributed throughout the whole of the scoring\nsheet. It has on the contrary a very definite positional relationship to the\nhits registered on the direct targets. In those regions where there is an\nabsence of direct hits on the target forward negative ( + i\n)\ndisplacement is a\ndominant feature. Thus in the case of a pair of consecutive misses or\nfailures on the direct targets represented schematically as follows :\nthere is a highly significant tendency for guess A which has missed its\nown direct target to miss also the ( + i) target D, always provided that D\nhas been missed by its own direct call C. That is to say in the case of a\npair of direct failures in succession the second failure is frequently\nheralded by a ( + i) precognitive failure. This might suggest that in those\nareas where ESP is not functioning directly there is sometimes a censored\nform of ESP still in operation. We may suppose that the function of the\ncensor is to prevent the ESP impressions from slipping into the normal\nconsciousness of the subject. In a world adapted to sense-perception\nESP is a disturbing influence which must be suppressed in the interests\nof everyday living. We may think of the censor as trying to discourage\nthis primitive awareness of the organism which we call extrasensory\ncognition. He may inhibit a card symbol known by ESP from emerging\ninto consciousness by suggesting one of the other four symbols to the\nFig. ii)\nGuess Target\nB\nD\nA\nC\n\fi8o] Some Aspects of Extrasensory Perception 145\nconscious mind. At the first of the two guesses in Fig. (i) the censor may\nknow that target D is an ESP impression in the offing, as it were. He\nthrows up a different symbol A into consciousness. At the second of the\ntwo guesses he is aware that D is now trying to sHp into consciousness as a\ndirect target, and this is again inhibited by the substitution of a different\nsymbol C.\nAnother way of stating the statistical effect described above is to observe\nthat in the case of pairs of consecutive misses on the direct targets the\ntotal ( + I ) for\\vard displacement score is exceeded very greatly by the\ntotal ( - i) backward displacement score worked out for these pairs and\nthat this holds for both the subjects D.W. and C.J.\nQuite a different situation arises in the case of pairs which consist of a\nmiss followed by a direct hit, or conversely of a direct hit followed by a\nmiss. These cases are represented schematically by [a) and [b) respectively\n:\nFig. (ii)\n(\u00ab) Guess Target\nA B Miss\nC C Hit\nGuess Target\nA A Hit\nB C Miss\nThe tendency now is for the fonvard ( + i) displacement in case (a) to be\ngreater than the backward (\n- i) displacement in case (b). This difference\nis significant, however, only in the case of the subject D.W. but still\nsuggestive in the case of C.J. In fact the general trend in case (a) is\ntowards a ( + i) forward positive displacement and this is the reverse of the\n( + i) forward negative displacement noted with pairs of misses.\nThere is indeed a tendency for the subject to anticipate a direct hit\nprecognitively one guess before he reaches it in the sequence.\nHence (a) becomes\nFig. (Hi)\nGuess Target\nC B\nC C\nQuite possibly the subject is unable to distinguish subconsciously between\na correct impression that is precognitive and one that is direct. He may\nfor instance in Fig. (iii) believe that he is guessing directly two consecutive\ncards bearing the same symbol.\nAs Pratt and Foster carefully emphasise, it is not at present possible to\nsay which is the correct interpretation out of a number of alternatives\nwhich the authors suggest in order to cover these interesting findings.\nMy own suggestion that there are regions of the scoring sheet in which\nESP is functioning so strongly that the censor allows both direct hits and\n( + 1) hits to escape into consciousness, and other regions in which ESP\nis so weak that the censor can cope with both direct and precognitive hits,\n\f146 Dr S. G. Soal [Part\nmay of course prove quite unacceptable in the light of further enquiry.\nThe authors' work is not presented as a complete study but as a progres-\nsive programme of research in which more and more records will be\nexamined and reported upon after they have been subjected to the same\nanalysis as that applied to the work of D.W. and C.J.\nAlthough the experimental conditions under which D.W. and C.J.\nworked are very similar, the results exhibit some curious differences. But\nthis is only to be expected in view of what was said about the uniqueness\nof extrasensory phenomena. Each subject's performance represents his\nown personality reaction to the experimental situation, and this reaction\nis modified by the extra-personal relations of the group with which he is\nworking. It was found for instance with C.J. that as the number of correct\nhits on the target card increased within the run, the average negative\nforward ( + i )\ndisplacement on a pair of consecutive misses also increased\nnumerically in a significant regression. There was a similar though some-\nwhat slower numerical increase on the average positive backward (-1)\ndisplacement on pairs of consecutive misses which ran parallel to the\nincrease in the number of direct hits in the run. No such relationship\nbetween direct and displacement scoring was observed in the case of the\nother subject.\nAgain the authors found that the negative score on forward displace-\nment was, with C.J. particularly, marked on pairs of consecutive misses\nthat immediately followed after direct hits, but this was not true of D.W.\nPratt and Foster suggest that C.J.'s strong negative forward displacement\nafter a direct hit may be his own personal reaction to a successful hit on the\ntarget card at which he is consciously aiming. This would imply that\nC.J. was subconsciously aware of having succeeded by ESP and responded\nin a way that was peculiar to his own psychological make-up. Another\nsubject might produce a quite different response. It is pointed out that\nthere are chronological variations in types of ESP functioning to be\nobserved even in the same individual when his records are studied over a\nsufficiently long period of time. In other series by C.J., both earlier and\nlater than the one under present consideration, forward negative displace-\nment on pairs of consecutive misses is absent though the subject continues\nhis high scoring on the target card. This does not mean that in selecting\nC.J.'s (DT) series for special examination from the mass of his other work\nwe have created a mere statistical artifact. For the authors show by means\nof a \" \/\n\" test that if we work out the average difference per run of ( + i) and\n(\n- I ) scores obtained from pairs of consecutive misses the corresponding\n\" \/\n\" value is 7.5 instead of the expected o value with 299 degrees of\nfreedom. Such a value would be expected to occur by chance only once\nin about lo^^ such series.\nAgain, the displacement phenomena of Mrs Stewart showed a complete\nreversal in sign when we re-started our experiments in 1945 after an\ninterval of eight years. That is, in 1936 she was scoring hits on the cards\none place ahead or behind the card she was aiming at, but for the past\nfive years she has been avoiding these two cards in a significant degree.\nIt will be asked whether the new series has shown displacement effects\nsimilar to those discovered in the work of C.J. and D.W. As yet only a\nvery cursory examination has been made of the Stewart records from this\n\fi8o] Some Aspects of Extrasensory Perception 147\nstandpoint but it seems probable that the negative ( + i) forward displace-\nment is not uniformly distributed over the series and that it is related to\nsuccess on the target card. We do not, however, anticipate the particular\neffects described by Pratt and Foster.\nThe appearance of both positive and negative displacement in different\nregions of the scoring sheet opens up interesting possibilities. It may well\nprove to be the case that displacement is less an exception than a normal\naccompaniment of scoring on a sequence of targets, as indeed Carington's\nwork seemed to suggest. Quite possibly in series which show no over-all\ndisplacement there may exist both positive and negative displacements\nwhich are separately significant but which cancel each other on the whole.\nThe findings of Pratt and Foster are certainly thought-provoking, if\nvery puzzling, and until many more cases of high scoring have been\nanalysed for such eff^ects one ought to be cautious in deciding which is the\nmost satisfactory of a number of possible explanations. As Dr Pratt has\nremarked, the answer to puzzling facts is to be found in more facts.\nThe original experimenters, Martin and Stribic, do not even mention\ndisplacement in their long and careful report, and the discovery twelve\nyears later of these totally unexpected results lends confirmation, if this\nwere needed, of the authentic character of their work. One could hardly\nsuppose that investigators or percipients would go to the immense trouble\nof faking these out-of-the-way effects without even drawing anyone's\nattention to them for a period of twelve years.\nIn our present state of knowledge it would probably be as futile to ask\nwhat extrasensory perception is as to ask what an electron really is. If,\nas Professor Price has suggested, ESP is a primitive kind of awareness\nwhich is characteristic of all matter, then it is probably not confined to\nliving organisms. In a certain sense it might be said that two electrons\nin different states behave as if they were mutually aware of each other. If\nthe basis of ESP is an all-pervasive fundamental awareness, it would not\nappear to be possible for the human mind to get behind it or to analyse\nit into any simpler elements. The various types of sense-perception,\ndeveloped by living organisms as they ascend in the scale of evolution,\nwould on the above view be regarded as highly differentiated and canalised\nforms of the primordial awareness. The primitive awareness thereby\nbecomes imprisoned in space and time and thus subject to the laws of\nphysics. As living organisms develop increasingly complex sensory\napparatus, more and more of the general awareness will be directed into\nsensory channels and extrasensory awareness will tend to disappear.\nThis suggests that psychical researchers who are competent biologists\nmight devise experiments to detect extrasensory perception at various\nlevels of the animal kingdom. Experiments with domestic animals and\nbirds are obviously indicated, but more lowly creatures might also be used.\nFor instance does ESP play any part in the homing instincts of newts?\nDo ants exhibit any extrasensory powers? Does ESP assist a salmon\nwhich returns to spawn in the same river in which it passed its early life\neven after the lapse of several years spent in the ocean, and upper migrations\nextending to hundreds of miles ? These are fascinating problems which are\ntoo often ignored by biologists.\n\f148 Dr S. G. Soal [Part\nAny theory that we form as to the working of extrasensory perception\nmust rest ukimately upon what view we take of the mind-body relation.\nIf for instance we beUeve that all mental events are caused by physical\nevents which occur in the brain and nervous system and that mental\nevents can never cause bodily events or other mental events, then it becomes\nimpossible to explain precognition and clairvoyance and extraordinarily\ndifficult to give any satisfactory account of telepathy. But I think it would\nbe correct to say that very few first-class philosophers either of the present\ngeneration or in the past have accepted epiphenomenalism as it is called.\nThe only people who cling to it nowadays are the physiologists and the\nbehaviourist psychologists. The pretensions of the latter have been\nmercilessly exposed by Professor Broad in his book, The Mind and its\nPlace in Nature.\nAny theory which hopes to interpret psychical phenomena must postu-\nlate I think that mental events such as ideas, images etc. exist in their own\nright and are not synonymous with chemical and electrical events that\ntake place in nervous systems. This was conceded by Whately Carington\nin his Association Theory of telepathy. Following Bertrand Russell,\nCarington considers the mind to consist of a large number of elementary\nconstituents\u2014sense data and images. Images are of the same nature as\nsense-data only less vivid and constant, and Carington uses the word\n\" psychon \" to cover both sense-data and images. Certain tensions and\nrelations exist among the members of a psychon system, and this is what is\nmeant by saying that the system is conscious. Those groups of the system\nin which tensions are particularly strong at a given instant would constitute\nthe normal consciousness of the mind, while the more quiescent groups\nwould constitute its subconscious. Carington evidently supposes that the\nsubconscious psychon systems of different minds have no relation to\nphysical space and that they form one large subconscious system or com-\nmon mind. The concept of a big mind composed of individual minds is\nof course an old one which goes back to the mysticism of ancient India, but\nCarington makes it somewhat more plausible by the atomic theory of mind\nwhich he adopts.\nCarington then assumes that the laws of association of ideas operate\nwithin the large mind just as they do in individual minds. In a telepathy\nexperiment the agent or sender associates the object he is trying to transmit\nwith the general idea of the experiment. This idea of the experimental\nset-up is, however, also present in the mind of the distant subject or re-\nceiver. This mutual idea is therefore likely to call up by association from\nthe common subconscious into the mind of the guesser the impression the\nagent is trying to send. Carington suggested that the more ideas the agent\nand subject have in common that are associated in the agent's mind with\nthe transmission object, the better the experiment ought to succeed.\nThe theory would appear to be most plausible when applied to Caring-\nton's own type of experiment in which a single sketch, say of a ship, is\npinned up in a room for several hours and is associated in the mind of the\nagent with the experimental set-up. But consider what happens in an\nordinary card-guessing experiment in telepathy in which five different\nsymbols are presented to the agent in random order at the rate of one\nevery two or three seconds. After a hundred cards have been called, each\n\fi8o] Some Aspects of Extrasensory Perception 149\nsymbol has been \" associated \" with the idea of the experiment about\ntwenty times. Can we really believe that at guess No. loi the power of\nassociation has any efficacy in calling up, say, the idea of a circle rather than\nthat of any one of the other four geometrical symbols? If five different\nobjects, one allotted to each symbol, were presented to the agent at the\nsame time as the corresponding cards, and these same objects were pre-\nsented in the same order to the guesser, this might give association a\nbetter chance to work. Yet it must be admitted that card-guessing experi-\nments are at least as successful as picture-guessing experiments of the type\ncarried out by Carington.\nBut there are probably other factors quite as potent as contiguous\nassociation which govern the recall of images from the subconscious.\nThe ideas which emerge into our conscious minds most frequently are\nthose around which our emotional interests are centred. If I see a tall\nchurch spire, that is associated in my mind with a great many things\n\u2014\nwith church bells, religious services, English history, and so on ; but if I\nhappen to be an enthusiastic mountaineer I am more likely to think of the\nMatterhorn than of any of these. This suggests that we might choose for\nour agent a person with five dominant interests which were also interests\nof the percipient, and employ symbols representing those interests.\nPersonally I have not found any evidence that by increasing the number\nof associative links between agent and guesser the experiment is any more\nsuccessful. This certainly did not happen in the London-Cambridge\nexperiments in which Mrs Stewart in London tried to get results with an\nagent in Cambridge who was unknown to her at the start of the test. First\nwe provided her with a photograph of the agent, then with a photograph\nof the card-table showing a violin resting on it and finally with a detailed\ndescription of the room in which the agent sat at Cambridge, but her score\nshowed no improvement.\nAs regards the psychon theory itself, I can only say that to a plain man\nlike myself it seems very odd indeed. For, according to Carington, the\nmind consists of nothing but a fluctuating group of images and sense data,\nsome arising from the body and some from the external world. No\ndirective or controlling agency is postulated. But there are many things\nwhich happen in our minds besides the experience of sense and images.\nThere are for instance judgements and discriminations, beliefs that certain\npropositions are true or false, inferences, aesthetic feelings and so on.\nNow these things appear to our introspection to be of a totally different\nnature from sense-perceptions and mental images. How then do they\narise in a mind whose fundamental constituents are sensa and images } We\nmight suppose them to be emergent qualities arising from groups and\nsensa and images. But if we have to assume that systems of psychons have\nproperties whose nature or existence could not be deduced from the\nqualities of the individual psychons I cannot see that this is going to\nfurnish us with any very intelligible theory of the structure of the mind.\nOn Carington's theory I cannot see how the mind would ever be able\nto transcend its immediate perceptions or how scientific knowledge and\nconstructive imagination could have arisen.\nBut though the psychon theory seems inadequate (to me at least) to\naccount for the whole range of mental phenomena, it may still provide us\n\fDr S. G. Soal [Part\nwith useful suggestions in the study of telepathy. I agree with Professor\nPrice that some kind of atomic theory of ideas and images is more helpful\nin psychical research than a unitary theory of the mind. We must be able\nto think of ideas and images as non-physical things which have an existence\nthat is independent of the mind by which they were originally owned.\nThat is, when an image is no longer present in consciousness it still\ncontinues to exist, but is now more loosely attached to the mind and under\nfavourable circumstances is free to insert itself into another person's\nconsciousness.\nWhether the association theory of telepathy is really useful is a matter\nto be tested by experiment. In my own work I have not found much\nsupport for it, though I am not sure that I have found any evidence that\nactually tells against it. Last year Mr Bateman and I carried out with\nMrs Stewart a good many tests in which two efficient agents focussed at\neach call simultaneously on different card symbols. On the assumption\nthat ideas emerge by association from a common subconscious sub-\nstratum it would be reasonable to expect that the percipient would receive\nimpressions from both agents and would probably be unable to discrimi-\nnate which came from A and which from B. That is, she would, since the\nagents were about equally good, now get a correct impression from A\nand now one from B and thus score significantly with both agents. But\nin practice this never happened. We found that she made a high score\nwith one of the two agents but obtained nothing from the other. If she\nreally received impressions from both A and B\u2014though not necessarily\nfrom both at the same call \u2014she was apparently able to distinguish, at\nsome level of her mind, between impressions coming from A and those\ncoming from B, and then ignore one set of impressions. But if she was\nreceiving impressions from A only, this does not fit in very well with the\nassociation theory.\nIt was noticed, however, on certain occasions that when Mrs Stewart\nwas informed beforehand that a person A was to be the agent but was left\nin ignorance of the fact that a second agent B was working in opposition\nto A, she succeeded with A but made no contact with B. In such a case\nit is possible, as Mr C. W. K. Mundle has suggested, that the idea of\n\" A being the agent \" which is common to both A and the percipient may\nserve as a \" K \" object in Carington's sense and cause A's card images\nto emerge by association into Mrs Stewart's mind. B of course also\npossesses this idea but to him it has not the same personal significance.\nWhether there is anything in this suggestion could only be determined\nhy suitable experiments.\nCarington's theory fails of course to provide any satisfactory explanation\nof clairvoyance, a term which is usually understood to mean extra-\nsensory knowledge of an event in the physical world which could not be\nderived from an acquaintance with the present, past, or future states of\nsome human or animal mind. The difficulties in the way of accounting\nfor clairvoyance on any hypothesis of physical radiation from material\nobjects has been sufficiently emphasised by both Professor Broad and\nDr Rhine, and I need not recapitulate them. Nor can Carington's theory\nexplain precognitive telepathy. Carington himself inclined to the belief\nthat cases of apparent clairvoyance were to be explained in terms of pre-\n\fi8o] Some Aspects of Extrasensory Perception 151\ncognitive telepathy, for which phenomenon he thought there was adequate\nindependent evidence. It is certainly true that the great majority of\nclairvoyance experiments with Zener cards could be accounted for by\nassuming acts of precognitive telepathy on the part of the guesser. That\nis, we suppose that the guesser did not directly cognise the symbols on\nthe cards themselves but that he became aware of the future mental\nimages which would be present in the mind of the person who ultimately\nchecked the order of the cards in the pack against the list of guesses.\nExperiments were therefore designed to eliminate the possibility of pre-\ncognitive telepathy, and certain of the tests gave results which, it was\nclaimed, could only be accounted for by postulating clairvoyance.\nAt the risk of re-opening a discussion of which I imagine most of us are\nheartily tired, I will state my own opinion that it is still possible to question\nthe adequacy of certain of these tests as actually carried out.\nLet us consider for instance the experiment recorded by Drs Humphrey\nand Pratt in the Journal of Parapsychology, December 1941. In this test\na large number of Zener cards were taken and each card was enclosed in\nan opaque sealed envelope. There were five chutes, each provided with\na kind of letter-box opening, and on each letter box was pinned one of\nthe five Zener symbols. The guesser was asked to drop each envelope\ninto the chute whose symbol he thought matched the card enclosed. The\nenvelopes fell down the chutes into five boxes, but in falling the order in\nwhich the envelopes were dropped into the chutes was not preserved.\nThe boxes were in another room and were unobserved by either the\nguesser or the experimenters. In order to check the success of this\nexperiment the investigator had only to count the number of correct cards\nwhich fell into each box.\nActually the evidence for clairvoyance was indirect, for there were\nsignificantly fewer correct guesses than chance would predict. There was\nin fact a negative deviation, and the odds against this being due to chance\ncoincidence amounted to about 1,000 to i. The assumption underlying\nthe experiment was that the guesser when about to drop, say, the tenth\nenvelope into a chute, would be unable to obtain from the mind of the\nperson who ultimately opened the envelope, the fact that this tenth\nenvelope contained a circle, since when the checker opens it he cannot\nknow that it is the tenth envelope owing to the original order having been\ndestroyed. All that the guesser could obtain by precognitive telepathy\nfrom the checker's mind is that ultimately each box will contain so many\ncircles, so many squares, etc., and this would be of little or no assistance to\nhim in identifying the card in the particular envelope he is holding.\nBut the assumption that the envelopes were indistinguishable from one\nanother was clearly not true in this particular experiment, since each\nenvelope had affixed to it a band of brown paper on which a code number\nand letter were written. If therefore the guesser noted the number Q12\non an envelope before he dropped it into one of the five chutes, he could\nobtain by precognitive telepathy from the mind of the checker who\nultimately opened the envelope, the fact that Q12 contained, say, a circle.\nBut even had the envelopes borne no code numbers, certain of them might\nhave been distinguished by, say, prominent specks on their faces or backs.\nWe have plenty of evidence that persons with good eyesight and good\n\fDr S. G. Soal [Part\nvisual memory are able to recognise a plain new postcard previously seen\nafter it has been mixed with several others of similar make. Even new\nplaying cards can be distinguished by means of specks and irregularities\non their backs. To make the experiment completely satisfactory it should\nhave been carried out in the dark and the envelopes dropped into the\nchutes by guessers who wore gloves.\nThe apparatus invented by Mr Denys Parsons and based on similar\nprinciples is free from these objections, but so far as I am aware no suc-\ncessful experiments in clairvoyance have yet been made with it.\nI do not mean to imply by these comments that there is no good evidence\nfor clairvoyance, but only that in such experiments as I am acquainted with\nthere is room for some improvement.\nMay I in conclusion make a few remarks about future methods of experi-\nment in extrasensory perception? I am not alone in the belief that the\npresent card-guessing and picture-guessing tests will have to be supple-\nmented by more delicate kinds of experiment if we are to learn anything\nreally worth while about the true nature of the extrasensory process. The\npresent methods can teach us very little for instance about the means by\nwhich the telepathic impulse emerges into consciousness. A greater use\nmight be made of psycho-analytic techniques and I would suggest that the\nalmost forgotten work of the psychologist Abramowski should be resumed\non a statistical basis. Abramowski did experiments which bring out the\nclose analogy between the realisation of an idea by a telepathic percipient\nand the revival of a memory. According to this psychologist unrealised\nmemory states exist in the form of emotional equivalents. These emo-\ntional equivalents which he thought form an important constituent of the\nbodily co-aesthesia manifest their existence to introspection when we try to\nrecall to memory some forgotten name. We are conscious of a certain\nfeeling tone which seems, as it were, to contain the forgotten image at its\ncore. But Abramowski was able to go further and compare experimentally\nthe relative strengths of these memory equivalents by studying the\ndifferent resistances which they offered to false suggestion.\nThus he would make one of his subjects read aloud in succession a list of\ntwenty concrete names or twenty proper names, as the case might be. The\nsubject would retain several of these words, but there would be certain\nwords which he had definitely forgotten. Abramowski made him write\ndown all the words he could definitely recall and then selected from his list\none of the forgotten words. He would now make a false suggestion to the\nsubject, and ask him if that was one of the forgotten words. The first\nsuggestion would be very remote from the real word and the subject would\nprobably refuse the suggestion. The experimenter would then proffer\nanother suggestion nearer in association to the real word but still not the\nreal word. The subject might refuse this word emphatically or he might\nfeel doubtful. Various words would be suggested, each nearer to the real\nword, and if the resistance of the forgotten word was strong the subject\nwould refuse every word until the true word was reached, which he would\naccept.\nBut if the resistance of the forgotten word was weak, the subject would\neither accept an associated word or not even recognise the real word.\n\fi8o] Some Aspects of Extrasensory Perception 153\nExperimenting in this way Abramowski found that concrete nouns have a\nfar stronger resistance to false suggestion than abstract nouns or numbers.\nAbramowski next went on to make experiments in telepathy with\nforgotten words. He would first make his subject read aloud in succession\na list of words consisting of concrete nouns, proper nouns, or abstract\nnouns, as the case might be.\nThe subject would note down as before the words he remembered. The\nexperimenter would then concentrate mentally on one of the forgotten\nwords, visualising its concrete meaning, etc. The subject would keep\nhimself passive and if the experiment was successful he would be able to\nrecall the word. Sometimes Abramowski made experiments by giving\nhis subjects four or five words to choose from while he concentrated on\none of them, thus anticipating the Rhine technique. It was found that the\ntelepathy experiments were most successful with those words whose\nmemor}' equivalents had the strongest resistance to false suggestion.\nThere was more success with concrete names than with proper names\nand least success in the case of numbers.\nIn order to show that the development of the telepathic image is intro-\nspectively similar to the development of an ordinary memory image, the\nexperimenter made his subject read aloud a list of forty words consisting\nin equal numbers of concrete nouns, proper nouns, adjectives, and abstract\nnouns. The subject then wrote down the words remembered. Abramow-\nski then made verbal suggestions on the forgotten words of the different\ncategories. Sometimes it happened that when a true word was suggested\nthe subject denied that it was in the list at all. On the other hand the\nsubject declared that certain false words suggested were in the list. The\nexperimenter then presented the true word that had been denied together\nwith false words that had been accepted, and asked the subject to say which\nof the three words was in the list. Usually he chose one of the two false\nwords. Without telling him whether he was correct or not the experi-\nmenter told him to shut his eyes and remain passive. Meanwhile the\nexperimenter concentrated mentally on the true word which had been\nrejected. In the majority of cases the subject changed his mind saying that\nthe rejected word now seemed to be in the list and that the false words had\nlost their feeling of being in the series. It happened a little later when the\ntelepathic influence had disappeared that the subject frequently reverted\nto his original opinion and voted for the false words again.\nIt would at least be worth while to repeat Abramowski's experiments\non a larger scale, and it should not be at all difficult to devise an appropriate\nstatistical method for evaluating the results.\n\f\fProceedings of the\n- Society for Psychical Research\nPart i8i\nPRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS\nBy Dr Gilbert Murray, O.M.\n{Delivered at a General Meeting of the Society on 21 May 1952)\nI observe that almost all the most impressive addresses given of late to\nthis Society have begun with an apology. They come from highly\nqualified philosophers, like Professors Broad and Price, who can analyse\nthe implications of the evidence, or at least of the current interpretations\nof it ; or from long and exact students of the history of the S.P.R., like\nMr and Mrs Salter ; or from experts who have observed or conducted\nlong series of scientifically controlled experiments. How much more\nhumbly must a complete non-expert like me make his apologies, when\nattempting to discuss the whole field of Psychical Research, and in part\nto explain the one corner of it in which he has had some personal experi-\nence.\nOn his last visit to Oxford William James once said to me, in a discus-\nsion about the future of religious belief, that he thought it would be\nlargely affected by the result of the researches of this Society. The state-\nment made me reflect. If we take religion in a narrow doctrinal sense,\nthere has certainly been a great liberalizing and internationalizing move-\nment. The Pope has lately been addressing a collection of twenty-four\nthousand boys and girls, some Protestant and some Catholic. On com-\nmittees at Geneva or Lake Success, Moslems, Jews, Hindus, Christians\nand Buddhists have worked together for various beneficient purposes\nwithout feeling any call to address each other as Unbelieving Dogs. But\nI do not think this Society played any part in that great change. If, how-\never, we take \" religion \" in a very wide sense, as meaning what has been\ncalled the \" inherited conglomerate \" of beliefs, habits, expectations,\napprovals and disapprovals dominant in a given society at a given time,\nI think one's judgement would be rather different. There have been\nduring the last two or three generations in England some large and sur-\nprising changes of outlook, in some of which I should judge that the\nS.P.R. has played a rather interesting part. We must not exaggerate.\nThere is much truth in Andrew Bradley's statement that the supposed\nVictorian family is the greatest work of creative imagination that the\ntwentieth century has produced. Nor must we forget that the \" inherited\nconglomerate \" is always to some degree in a flux, varying from old to\nyoung, from generation to generation, and of course varying widely in\nthe same generation between the educated and uneducated. Still the\nG ISS\n\fDr Gilbert Murray [Part\nchanges of the last seventy or eighty years have been rather exceptionally\nmarked.\nOf course, the political, social and economic problems have greatly\nchanged. But I doubt if Psychical Research has had any great effect on\nthem. In science itself the advances have been almost revolutionary,\nespecially, I suppose, in physics. I was brought up to believe that the\ntypes of certain truth were Euclid's theorems and Newton's law of gravita-\ntion. Einstein showed them both to be inadequate and in a sense unreal.\nWhat was one to believe after that? I was brought up to believe that the\nEarth was gradually cooling and that, like the Moon, she would become\ntoo cold to support life. Then, on the contrary, I learned that she would\nbecome intolerably hot ; and later, that neither view was true, she would\nexplode. I was told that the sun was a fixed star. Not at all ; the whole\nuniverse was receding at enormous speed ; that it was expanding ; that\nit was coming into existence ; and lastly, when the layman's mind was\nalready reeling, that space itself was curved\u2014whatever that might mean.\nThe orthodox conglomerate was wonderfully open-minded and ready to\nwelcome new ideas, except indeed just in the region that interests us most.\nThere it was decidedly intolerant, would stand no nonsense. It would\nnot listen. A belief in hypnosis, for instance, now a well-ascertained fact,\nwas beyond the pale. The fact that various strange phenomena, which\nwe now explain as hypnotic, were handed down in the popular tradition,\ntold against them rather than for them to the scientific convention of the\nday. They seemed to be only old superstitions revived. The Viennese\nphysician Mesmer, whose hypnotic cures had spread his fame all over\nEurope, was treated as a charlatan, examined in a hostile spirit and finally\ndiscredited. A generation later EUiotson, Professor of Medicine at London\nUniversity, was ordered by the authorities to discontinue his hypnotic\nexperiments, whereupon he resigned his chair. About the same time\nEsdaile, a surgeon in the Indian Service, performed some three hundred\noperations under hypnotic anaesthesia, but medical journals refused to\npublish his reports. In 1842 W. S. Ward in London amputated a thigh\nwith the patient under \" mesmeric trance \", and reported the case to the\nRoyal Medical and Chirurgical Society. The Society heard, but refused\nto listen ; the patient was accused of being an imposter, and the record\nof any such paper having been read was struck from the minutes of the\nSociety. It was not until nearly a hundred years after Mesmer's chief\ncases, when Charcot took up hypnosis at the Salpetriere, that hypnosis\ngained full credence and was accepted as a branch of medical practice.^\nA very similar history of intolerance could be told of faith-healing, tele-\npathy, and various other phenomena. A great part of the whole science\nof psychology has developed from the systematic observation of pheno-\nmena which would have been scornfully set aside a hundred years ago as\nsuperstitions unworthy of attention.\nDo not let us be unjust to this sceptical or negative attitude. We must\nnot forget how close Europe still was to very cruel and revolting super-\nstitions. England itself was comparatively safe. The statute prescribing\nthe burning of witches had been repealed in 1738, though Ruth Osborn\n' I have quoted the above almost verbally from M. Polanyi's The Logic of\nLiberty (Routledge, 1951).\n\fi8i] Presidential Address 157\nwas ducked as a witch and then murdered by a mob in Hertfordshire,\nclose to London, in 1751. But in Ireland, in my own lifetime, a child,\nwho was for some reason reputed to be a changeling, was beaten and\nburned with irons, the mother being locked out of the room while the\ninvading fairy was exorcised, though unfortunately the child died in the\nprocess. A witch was burned in a village near Monte Cassino, so I am\ntold by a friend who lived there, ini9i2ori9i3. I knew an Englishman\nwho somehow\" lost his memory in Italy, and was found some days after\ntied up in a market-place as a madman and beaten to drive out the evil\nspirit. In northern Greece a friend of mine found a madman tied up in\na public place for anyone passing to beat as he chose. Such possibilities\nwere near enough to have left behind them a real horror. So no wonder\nthe men of science felt that the great need of the time was not to search\nsympathetically for such elements in old beliefs as might be really true,\nbut firmly to reject the whole mass of degrading and inhuman nonsense.\nNone the less this excessively sceptical attitude provoked some reac-\ntion. There really are more things in the world than the science of any\nperiod can fully account for. One can see the feeling of this in many\nleading nineteenth-century thinkers, such as Carlyle and Ruskin, and even\nin J. S. Mill himself. And, of course, a much grosser kind of superstition\nmakes a lasting appeal to human nature. The preacher who cries in\nCarlyle's words, \" Come unto me ye who hunger and thirst to be bam-\nboozled \", will always find a response. Among the remote and unedu-\ncated, particularly perhaps among the Celtic fringes, there was generally\na survival, or sometimes a passionate resurgence, of unauthorised super-\nnatural beliefs.\nMuch of the boldest and most uncritical offensive, however, came from\nAmerica. The fact is patent, and I think one can see the explanation.\nIn that great democracy the common man, however unqualified, has\npretty full freedom of speech. The aristocratic tradition in England and\nEurope generally makes the uneducated rather timid about asserting their\nown ideas in public against those of the experts. The actual founder of\nAmerican spiritualism is said to have been Andrew Jackson Davis of\nPoughkeepsie, who was thrown into genuine trances and expounded a\nmystical doctrine of spirit communion, called Harmonial Philosophy, in\nseveral large volumes.^ But Spiritualism as a vigorous popular movement\nseems to have started chiefly from the Fox sisters. The two younger pro-\nduced communications from the spirits by means of raps, and also various\npoltergeist phenomena. Both, it seems, were remarkably attractive young\nwomen, while the mother and eldest sister were experts in salesmanship.\nThey had astonishing success both in America and in England, where so\ngreat a scientist as Sir William Crookes was convinced by them. Their\nfather, however, had been a drunkard, and the girls eventually took after\nhim. Kate wrote and withdrew confessions proclaiming that the pheno-\nmena were all a fraud\u2014excepting, curiously enough, the actual raps,\nwhich were in some sense genuine. Margaret confirmed the confession,\nand the whole business ended in singular squalor. One cannot but sus-\npect that if the arts of observation and detection had been better developed\nin the middle of the last century, many of the wonder-workers of the time\nF. Podmore's Modern Spiritualism, Vol. I, p. 158\n\fDr Gilbert Murray [Part\nsuch as the Foxes, Florence Cook and even the great D. D. Home himself\nwould, like Mme Blavatsky, have had more interrupted careers.\nCertainly a disproportionate number of mediums and thaumaturges\nand founders of new religions were American. Not many European\ncountries can produce figures like Joseph Smith or Brigham Young, the\nfounders of Mormonism, or Mrs Eddy, the founder of Christian Science,\nor even Dr Buchman, not to speak of Amy Macpherson and hundreds of\npersons of equally vulnerable pretensions. One popular preacher in\nChicago who used to send me literature discovered that he was the prophet\nElijah reincarnate, and in order to convince possible doubters, took to\nwearing large wings. One could quote such extravagances by the dozen.\nBut one strange development which could not, I think, have occurred\nexcept in America was the history of the New Motor which was to save\nmankind. A man with an enthusiastic faith in machinery, though no\ngreat knowledge of its working, felt it to be obvious that Salvation, like\neverything else, could be much more effectively produced by machine\npower than by human labour. Mesmeric, or as we should say hypnotic,\ninfluences were then called \" animal magnetism \", and, since the earth\nwas a great magnet, there was obviously a tremendous store of mesmeric\nforce there ready to be tapped. By the guidance of a series of dreams\nthis man succeeded in building a motor which was to concentrate in itself\nthe magnetic force of the earth and so manufacture Salvation on a world-\nwide scale. With the help of subscriptions it was made and set up, but\nsomehow would not work. Various expedients were tried. The Faithful\ngathered round it in prayer, but in vain. Presently a leading spiritualist\nwas called in to advise. He decided that the dreams were genuine and\ncame from the spirit world ; but that any engineer would see that the\nmachine could not move without breaking itself, and perhaps the spirits\nhad wished to try or merely to tease the inventor. Meantime, however, a\nwoman in the south, several hundred miles away, had it revealed to her\nthat what the machine wanted was a mother, and that she was called upon\nto assume that sublime office. She came to see the inventor, who reports\nwith obvious good faith : \"I did not quite understand what she wanted,\nbut I gave her the key of the shed.\" But even when mothered it would\nnot move. At last someone suggested that it was in much too high a\nposition. It was not near enough to the magnetic centre of the earth. So\nsome hundred or so of the Faithful harnessed themselves to it and dragged\nit over miles of farmland to the bottom of a river valley. There, no doubt,\nit might have performed better, but the ignorant farmers of the neigh-\nbourhood broke it up and threw it into the river. The story is told in\ndetail in Mr Podmore's book. The New Motor. Fashions change, but the\ninterest in the supernormal continues. A book published in 1946 reports\nthat there were then twenty-five thousand practising astrologers in the\nUnited States.\nWe must not forget the English newspapers which employ a regular\nastrologer, nor yet the temporary vogue among more intellectual circles\nof Mme Blavatsky and her brand of theosophists. My point is to illus-\ntrate the great mass of utterly unacceptable material which lay before the\nscientists of the mid-nineteenth century. First there was a vast respect-\nable tradition of miracles and wonders, much of it supported by religious\n\fi8i] Presidential Address 159\ndoctrine ;\nnext, a large but indefinite remnant of primitive superstition\namong the uneducated ;\nthirdly, the constantly recurring interest, I had\nalmost said the craving, among educated and uneducated alike, to dis-\ncover, or hope to have discovered, some certainty behind the veil. It is\nalso worth remembering that, overwhelmingly strong as the tradition is of\nthe existence of prophets and shamans with superhuman powers, it is\nalways accompanied by a suspicion of possible fraud or false pretensions.\nAnd the same suspicion accompanies the modern evidence. Mrs Salter\nrecords that in her childhood she saw something of the famous medium\nEusapia Palladino, and though she did not attend any of the actual\nseances, remembers that in unprofessional moments Eusapia cheated at\nevery game she played.\nWe can understand the indignant phrase of my old colleague Lord\nKelvin, that all the phenomena were \" half fraud and half bad observa-\ntion \", as well as the wiser conclusion of Professor Sidgwick that, in the\nface of such a bewildering mass of remarkable and ill-attested phenomena,\nit was \" a sheer scandal \" that they should be left with no serious attempt\nto find out what parts of them, if any, were true. That, of course, was the\npurpose with which this Society was founded, and the quest on which it\nhas been engaged for over seventy years.\nWhat have we actually discovered? It is hard to say. Hypnosis is now\naccepted as a vera causa in medical science. Much akin to hypnosis are\nvarious forms of psychotherapy recognised and practised in hospitals.\nGoing a step further, I think we are bound to admit the fact of actual\nfaith-healing. The evidence from Lourdes and other Christian shrines\nis very strong, and is confirmed by similar or even more abundant evidence\nfrom Hindu shrines ; nor should we forget the successes of Christian\nScience. The actual limits of faith-healing must be left for medical\nscience to determine. The fact of immediate relief is certain ;\nwounded\nmen in great pain calling for morphia have fallen peacefully asleep on\nreceiving an injection of pure water. Continuous relief in chronic cases\nseems certain, and by the relief of anxiety and a consequent lessening of\nthe flow of blood to the affected part, has sometimes been hard to dis-\ntinguish from actual cure. I have known one case of this in my own\nfamily. We need not therefore be quite as puzzled as the seventeenth\ncentury Dean of Wells in Aubrey's Miscellanies^ who writes :\n\" the curing\nof the King's evil by the touch of the King doeth puzzle my philosophic ;\nfor, whether they were of the house of York or of Lancaster, it did.\"\nSimilarly, when Freud released many patients from dangerous repressions\nby getting them to remember some forgotten incident of their childhood,\nin some cases it turned out that the incident had never really taken place.\nIt was just imaginary. But the cure worked. Then, again, every anthro-\npologist will remind us that Faith can kill as well as cure ; there are well-\nproven cases from New Zealand and the Pacific Islands of people who\nhave died because they believed they had been touched by a magician or\nhighly tabu chief. My brother in Papua saw a man give another a handful\nof pebbles. \" What are these? \" said the man. \" They are sent specially\nto you by so-and-so,\" was the answer, mentioning the name of a well-\nknown sorcerer. \" Oh, then I am done for,\" said the victim, and died\nthat night.\n\fi6o Dr Gilbert Murray [Part\nOf all the problems that faced the S.P.R. on its foundation, the first\nand greatest, I suppose, was the problem so confidently answered by the\nSpiritualists : do we in some sense survive our bodily death, and is there\ncommunication between the living and the spirits of the dead? The sub-\nject is too large and important to be treated in passing. We may note\nMrs Sidgwick's conclusion, reached after considerable study, that the\nevidence of survival did not amount to proof, but was enough to justify\npersonal belief.\nMembers of the Society will remember the two attempts that were\nmade to obtain a wide Census of Hallucinations : it came out in both\nthat roughly ten to eleven per cent, of those questioned had had hallucina-\ntions, and of the hallucinations about ten per cent, appeared to be veridical.\nA striking attempt was made by Mr Podmore to show that all such\nphantasms were phantasms of the living, not of the dead. This would\napply to one striking case of which I had some knowledge, and which is\nin one point very remarkable. The phantasm of an intimate friend of\nmine appeared early one morning on September 3rd or 4th 1898, to a\nlady he knew in London. She felt, as usual in such cases, no particular\nsurprise, and reported that he was smiling and said, \" I am going on on the\nnth.\" It was just after the Battle of Omdurman. My friend survived\nthe battle, but was killed the day after. The phrase \" on the nth \" had\nno ascertainable meaning ; what he really did was to \"go on with the\nnth \", that is, the nth Lancers, a regiment to which he did not belong.\nMust he not really have said, \" I am going on ivitli the nth \", and been\nmis-heard? If so, it would seem to follow that the phantom was not\nmerely a creation of the percipient's mind, but was carrying a real message.\nIt is, of course, extremely difficult in many cases like these to prove either\na positive or a negative. But my own impression is that most of the\ncommonly reported wonders, both traditional and new-fangled, have so\noften been proved to be either misreported or misobserved or sometimes\nsimply fraudulent, that they must be regarded, to say the least of it, with\nextreme suspicion ; I would include in this category spirit photographs,\nhaunted houses, extensions of the human body and the great majority of\npoltergeists.\nA new standard of strictly scientific observation of these supernormal\nphenomena is evidently a great desideratum. And for one class of them\nsuch a standard has been successfully set by Dr Soal in his statistically con-\ntrolled experiments with Mr Shackleton and Mrs Gloria Stewart, and on a\ngreater and more elaborate scale by Prof. Rhine and his staff at the Duke\nUniversity, North Carolina, where there is a special Institute of Para-\npsychology with fifteen rooms and a staff of six to eight whole-time para-\npsychologists.^ I cannot criticise the work of the Institute, except to say\nthat the good faith of the workers seems undoubted, and the accuracy of\nthe methods well attested, yet the statistical results reported are\u2014to me\nat least\u2014quite incredible. In the field of Precognition especially there\nare parts as to which I find myself belonging to the class described by\nDr Soal as \" hopelessly prejudiced by some outmoded philosophy which\nthey probably imbibed in their youth and which they are too old to\nabandon \". I have always held, in accord with all my scientific friends,\n^ See the description by Dr West in the Journal, XXXV, Pt. 656, Jan.-Feb. 1950.\n\fi8i] . Presidential Address i6i\nand with that admittedly dangerous guide, Common Sense, that the\ncause which produces an effect must come before the effect ; the cause\nprecedes, the effect follows. I know, of course, that Time is called a\nFourth Dimension ; and I fully recognise that the exact placing of any\nevent requires three dimensions in space and one in time. But surely\nthere is nothing magical in that. It is not the sort of fourth dimension\nwhich would enable us, for instance, to see and touch the inside of a solid. I\nquite see that our whole conception of events in the universe must be con-\nditioned by the limitations imposed on our minds by our bodily structure ;\nthat the whole world would be exceedingly different to us if we could really\n\" know, hear and say\nWhat this tumultuous body now denies,\nFeel, who have put our groping hands away.\nAnd see, no longer blinded by our eyes.\"\nWhat repels me is the supposition that sometimes, some few of these\nlimited minds should, for no ascertainable reason, completely overcome\nthe limitations of human reason in one small point, while leaving all\nothers unchanged. If I go with Alice into a Looking-glass world I shall\nexpect to find that left is right, that people cry because they are going to\nbe hurt, and pick themselves up because they are going to fall down. But\nI should at least expect some consistency. I look for some other explana-\ntion. I may add that I have read Mr Dunne's book twice in the hope of\nbeing convinced, but have not been. I think that the reasoners who do\nmagic with a fourth dimension are like those who draw conclusions about\nthe real world from the use of surds in mathematical formulae. I am, of\ncourse, ready to accept mathematical calculations which make use of the\nsquare root of - i, or the convention that A to the power of o equals\nunity, but I do not believe that the convention is more than a convention\nor that I shall ever meet the square root of - i in real life. Consequently\nI feel enormous difficulty in accepting some of the statistical phenomena\nof precognition which, I confess, I am unable to explain otherwise. My\nold-fashioned mind notes with much comfort that Dr Soal himself feels\ndoubts about precognition by pure clairvoyance with no help from tele-\npathy.\nWhat we are told is that in Prof. Rhine's experiments the percipient,\nwhile trying to guess the card that is dealt, happens, to a significant degree\nof frequency, to hit by mistake not that card but another card which has\nnot been dealt, but is going to be dealt a few seconds later, which he is\nnot trying to guess, and which is at the time not known to the dealer or\nany other human being. It is possibly made a little more plausible when\nwe find that the guesses which do not hit their real mark are chiefly apt\nto hit the card next before or next after. This seems like normal shooting,\na few shots hitting the bull, but more going just to the right or just to the\nleft, but it would still involve some, to me, incredible hypotheses. I look\nhopefully towards the metaphysicians, such as Professors Broad and\nPrice, to reveal some explanation which does not involve one of two\nincredible hypotheses : one that a man's naming of a card in an erroneous\nguess at another card should make a card of the sort named in another\nroom make its way unobserved out of a pack and get itself dealt ; the\nother, that the dealing of a card at a later time should cause a right guess\n\fl62 Dr Gilbert Murray [Part\nto have been made some time earlier. To Dr Soal it would make all the\ndifference if at the later time the dealer should see the card ; then it would\nat least not be the dead material card itself that caused the guess to have\nbeen made, it would be the thought which the dealer did not have at the\ntime but was presently going to have which had influenced the mind of\nthe guesser. Both views accept the conclusion which I find inacceptable,\nthat an effect can precede its cause. I cannot feel much comforted by the\nexplanation that the difference in time is only a matter of seconds and\nmight be covered by that enduring moment which we commonly call\n\" now \" or \" the present \". However, I know I may be wrong.\nI feel on different grounds a similar incredulity about Dr Rhine's\nstartling cases of telekinesis. Considering the vast experience of the\nhuman race in tossing dice and coins and the extreme interest which\nmillions of gamblers have taken for hundreds of years in the way they\nfall, if human thought or will could really compel a die or a coin to fall\nin the position the agent wishes, I think we should have heard much more\nabout it by now. Here, again, I note with relief that Dr Soal, too, is\nsceptical about telekinesis, and \" sees no sign of a genuine physical medium\non the horizon \".\nAs to telepathy, however, I cannot maintain this healthy scepticism.\nThere are three numbers of the Proceedings which would confound me if\nI did. They contain accounts and criticisms of my own experiences as a\npercipient ;\nmy Presidential Address in 19 15, Mrs Verrall's \" Report of\na series of experiments in Guessing \" (1916), and Mrs Sidgwick's \" Report\non Further Experiments in Thought Transference \" in 1924. I have also\nseveral bundles of records of later sessions, though of late years, owing\npartly to the complete dispersal of my children and the rest of our old\ngroup, I have given up the experiments.\nLet me say at once that my experiments belong to the pre-statistical\nstage of psychical research, when the experiments were treated almost as\na parlour game. Still I do not see how there can have been any significant\nfailure of control ; nor did Mrs Verrall or Mrs Sidgwick. The conditions\nwhich suited me best were in many ways much the same as those which\nprofessional mediums have sometimes insisted upon. This is suspicious,\nyet fraud, I think, is out of the question ; however slippery the behaviour\nof my sub-conscious, too many respectable people would have had to be\nits accomplices. I liked the general atmosphere to be friendly and familiar ;\nany feeling of ill-temper or hostility was apt to spoil an experiment. Noises\nor interruption had a bad effect. One question that arose was the degree\nto which the telepathy made use of real sights, sounds, smells, memories,\nto reach its goal. The general conclusion was curious. It seemed that I,\nor my sub-conscious, showed some anxiety to explain away the telepathy\nby seizing upon some such excuse. It said it had guessed Savonarola\nmaking the women burn their precious possessions because it smelt a\ncoal which had fallen out of the fire ; that it had guessed Sir A. Zimmern\nriding on a beach in Greece because it said it had heard a horse on the\nroad\u2014when the rest of the company heard no horse. Memories, again,\nsometimes helped it, but more often hindered it in its search. At one\ntime, indeed, I was inclined to attribute the whole thing to subconscious\nauditory hyperaesthesia. I got almost no successes if the subject was not\n\fi8i] Presidential Address 163\nspoken, but only written down. Two or three successes and at least one\nerror could be explained by my having heard or mis-heard a proper name,\ne.g. by confusing Judge Davies and the prophet David. But, apart from\nother difficulties in this hypothesis, there were some clear cases where I\ngot a point or even a whole subject which had only been thought and not\nspoken.\nOf course, the personal impression of the percipient himself is by no\nmeans conclusive evidence, but I do feel there is one almost universal\nquality in these guesses of mine which does suit telepathy and does not\nsuit any other explanation. They always begin with a vague emotional\nquality or atmosphere :\n\" This is horrible, this is grotesque, this is full of\nanxiety \" ; or rarely, \" This is something delightful \" ; or sometimes,\n\" This is out of a book,\" \" this is a Russian novel \", or the like. That seems\nlike a direct impression of some human mind. Even in the failures this\nfeeling of atmosphere often gets through. That is, it was not so much\nan act of cognition, or a piece of information that was transferred to me,\nbut rather a feeling or an emotion ; and it is notable that I never had any\nsuccess in guessing mere cards or numbers, or any subject that was not\nin some way interesting or amusing.\nLet us consider what w-e mean by telepathy. I believe most of us in\nthis Society are inclined to agree with Bergson that it is probably a common\nunnoticed phenom.enon in ordinary life, especially between intimates. We\nall know how often two friends get the same thought at the same moment.\nTolstoy, the most acute of observers, speaks of \" the instinctive feeling\nwith which one human being guesses another's thoughts, and which\nserves as the guiding thread of conversation.\" ^ Most teachers will agree\nthat one of the marks of a good teacher is the degree of telepathy he can\nstir in his pupils. The same thought explains why a lecture or course of\nlectures, if good, can be more effective than the reading of a textbook,\nthough the textbook almost always contains more information. And\nwhat about the impression people receive from the shared enjoyment of\ndrama, poetry, music, or even, I think, some of the more imaginative\nbranches of philosophy? Is there not some telepathy, some shared sensiti-\nvity, at work\u2014not very different from that which a dog feels when he shares\nthe trouble or anxiety of his master.? - And shall I be wrong in suggesting\nthat it is just in these cases that our main instrument, language, rather\nfails us and, like the dog, we have to appeal to something less perfectly\narticulate }\nThe point will be clearer if I take some typical examples of my own\nexperiences, both successful and unsuccessful. I choose them from the\nunpublished bundles of which I spoke, which are later than Mrs Sidg-\nwick's collection.\nThe method w-as always the same. I was sent out of the drawing-room\neither to the dining-room or to the end of the hall, the door or doors, of\ncourse, being shut. The others remained in the drawing-room : someone\nchose a subject, which was hastily written down, word for word. Then\n^ Childhood ajid Youth, p. 141. In another place he says of Nekhludoff that,\n\" when a chord was struck in his mind, a chord in mine vibrated \".\nThis sympathy is not, I think, entirely explained by the excitation of the man's\nadrenalin glands which is smelt by the dog : the smell of adrenalin seems generally\nto irritate or annoy a dog.\n\f164 Dr Gilbert Murray [Part\nI was called in, and my words written down. I may add that, out of the\nfirst 505 cases, Mrs Verrall estimated the percentage as : Success, 33 per\ncent. ; Partial Success, 27-9 per cent. ;\nFailure, 39 per cent. But it may\nbe remarked that as evidence for the presence of some degree of telepathy\nmost of the partial successes are quite as convincing as the complete\nsuccesses : this would produce something like 60 per cent, evidential\nand 40 per cent, non-evidential.\nFirst, two perfectly ordinary cases, where the emotional atmosphere is\nobvious and strong, and then is developed into something more definite.\nOctober 26 1924 (?).\nMy wife gave a subject :\nM.H.M. \" This is not a nice thing. What Nansen was describing\nthe other day of the church yard at Buzuluk, where there lay the great\npile of corpses, numbers of children who had fallen dead in the night.\"\nI was summoned, and said :\nG.M. \" This is perfectly horrible. It's the Russian famine.

I associate it with Nansen's lecture here.\"\nHere came memory in as a help. The subject was an incident that I\nremembered. In the next it was an obstacle : that is, a remembered in-\ncident thrust itself in and had to be rejected before I could get the real\nsubject. I should explain that my mother had a story that when she was\nat a school in France, she had been made to wear a placard labelled\nmipie .\nNovember 24 1929.\nMRS DAViES. \" Jane Eyre at school standing on a stool, being called a\nliar by Mr Brocklehurst.

In the first place, as far\nas my own experience goes, it does not quite feel like cognition or detec-\ntion ; it is more like the original sense of the word \" sympathy \",\naviMTTadeta the sharing of a feeling, or \" co-sensitivity \". I seem to be pass-\nive, and feel in a faint shadowy way the feeling or state of mind of someone\nelse. Tolstoy's metaphor of the chord which vibrates when another chord\nis struck seems to express it.\n\fi8i] Presidential Address 167\nIf we follow the general lines suggested by Bergson we may suppose\nan original store, so to speak, of vague undifferentiated sensitivity belong-\ning to all gregarious creatures, which is then \" canalised \" into particular\nclearer and more efficient forms as the creature develops definite sense\norgans. These senses again become keener and more effective as they\nare needed and used, but fade away if they are not used, while some\nremnant of the original weak uncanalised sensitivity is still there to be\ndrawn upon.\nI have tried to get some guidance from books on the intelligence of\nanimals. But the books are unfortunately all written by human beings,\nwho keep testing their examinees by the intelligence tests to which they\nthemselves are accustomed\u2014reasoning, inference, speed in learning and\nthe like. No wonder the poor victims cut rather a miserable figure. I\nwonder what sort of show we should make if dogs tested us for our powers\nof finding our way or following a trail, or if spiders criticised our power of\nsymmetrical web-weaving. Mr Romanes, for example, told his dog, a\nsetter, to follow him. He then set off in Indian file, with eleven men\nfollowing his footsteps, his gamekeeper, a special friend of the dog, com-\ning last. After two hundred yards, he turned off to the right with five\nmen, the other six going to the left. The dog was then let loose, and, by\nsmell or otherwise, made out his master's track with eleven other foot-\nprints over it. Among many much stronger sense impressions it dis-\ncerned unfailingly the one that it needed, that it craved. We civilised\nwhite men are hardly at all dependent on our sense of smell or our power\nof following a trail, and are consequently very helpless in such matters.\nThe Australian blacks, however, are almost as clever as dogs. \" The\nArunta \", I read, \" have extraordinary aptitudes for all that pertains to\nthe quest of food. Their skill in following a trail is wonderful. Not only\ndoes a black know the tracks of all animals and birds, but when he has\nexamined a burrow he can say at once from the direction of the latest\ntracks, or even by smelling the earth at the entrance of the burrow,\nwhether the animal is at home or not. He will also know the footprints of\nall his acquaintance.\" ^\nTake again the sense of direction. A bat can find its way in the dark,\nflying fast this way and that among obstacles without hitting them. One\nbat at least still found its way when some scientific inquirer put out its\neyes. Good authorities, such as Bethe and Fabre, consider that a \" special\nsense of direction, not dependent on sight \", exists in bees and wasps.^\nWe all know how a cat or dog taken a hundred miles away in a train often\nfinds its way back to the home it has left. There must surely be some\nelement of the same faculty in homing pigeons. That power has fallen\ninto disuse with civilised man. But Lapps, Finns, Eskimo and Red\nIndians seem to have it. I have read of a Lapp setting forth confidently\nover a trackless and treeless country covered with snow, to meet another\nLapp who was coming to see him at a spot about 150 miles off. He knew\nexactly the direction in which to go, and was sure of keeping it. Even\nmore surprising is a record quoted by Galton from the Journal of Captain\n^ Sommerfelt, La Langue et la Societe, p. 80 ; based on Spencer and Giller, and\nStrehlow.\n^ Washburn, The Animal Mind, p. 26\n\fi68 Dr Gilbert Murray [Part\nHall, published in 1879 by the U.S. Government. An Eskimo who had\nbeen traveUing for several months, covering a distance of more than 11 00\nmiles, was asked to draw a map to show where he had been ; he drew a\nmap of his journey stage by stage, which is described as rather more\nexact than the Admiralty Chart of 1870.'^ There are probably here also\na few special sensitives among us ; but on the whole the faculty has been\nlost by disuse. In hearing, again, the animals that are habitually hunted\nby beasts of prey have generally developed great acuteness of hearing, at\nleast for the sounds that may mean danger. So have the Red Indians,\nwho in the midst of much irrelevant noise from wind and water, will\ninstantly detect the crack of a small twig that may mean an enemy's foot-\nstep. One may wonder why many small animals\u2014but not as a rule large\nones\u2014can hear the cries of a bat and other sounds which are too high for\nthe human ear. Galton tells us how he once walked out in London with\nan instrument producing strong super-auditory sounds. No one took\nany notice except cats and small dogs, who became highly excited. Some\ncreatures, again, are sensitive to ultra-violet lights which the human eye\ncannot see ; and some low forms of life without eyes are nevertheless\naffected by light, and seem to have a vague uncanalised sensitiveness in\ntheir bodies, to such things as magnetic currents and balance. This is\nnot, of course, telepathy, but it seems to show the reality of an undif-\nferentiated sensitivity capable of taking different forms.\nAnd I must say it is very difficult not to see telepathy in the action of\nflocks of birds and of many gregarious animals. We have all seen a flock\nof rooks or of field fares start suddenly and simultaneously in flight.\nThere is a similar collective and sudden movement in migrations, though\nno doubt there are external reasons of date or of weather which have con-\ntributed to the joint decisions. There is a wonderful description by\nKropotkin of a Siberian lake, crowds of ducks on the water and big birds\nof prey watching hungrily all round, but never daring to touch the flock\nbecause it all defends itself as one unit. Stampedes of cattle, buffaloes,\nzebras, and other gregarious animals seem to be the result of a sudden\nemotion sweeping through the herd, not of detailed individual obedience\nto an order or imitation of a leader. A panic in a human army seems to\nbe much the same, an inrush of undefined and unexplained terror com-\nmunicating itself telepathically from man to man. And surely the so-\ncalled language of animals is just this contagious emotion. When a dog\ninvites another dog to come off after rabbits, when a bee by means of its\ncurious dance urges another bee to fly oft\" for honey in a particular direc-\ntion, when an ant by a well-known movement of its antennae explains\nthat its load is too heavy and that it needs help, we cannot suppose that\nthere is any mention of rabbits or honey or loads ; a cry of emotion, an\nexpression of feeling in a particular situation is enough. The feeling is\ninfectious and is shared. This faculty is needed by the animals just\nbecause they have no language proper ;\nman, possessing that vastly\nsuperior means of exact communication, has not the same urgent need\nfor this faculty, but seems to share in it to some extent.\nThese are only conjectures, and the conjectures of one who has little\nclaim to any special knowledge of psychology or philosophy, or any\n^ Galton, op. cit., p. 72.\n\fi8i] Presidential Address 169\nknowledge at all of zoology. They represent merely an attempt to find a\nplace in the coherent world that we know for these strange powers and\nqualities of the human mind. The points on which I speak with some\nconviction are, first, that telepathic communication does take place, and\nsecondly that as far as my own experience goes it seems to me to be a\ncommunication of feeling rather than of cognition, though the cognition may\nfollow as the feeling is interpreted. To these I add the conjecture that\nour ordinary everyday telepathy may be a faded and greatly intellectualised\nform of a sensitivity which exists much more simply and widely among\nmany birds and gregarious animals and primitive races of men.\nBut there may be more than that in it. The differences between the\nhuman and non-human are very great. Our whole range of sensitivity\nhas been so widely increased by our possession of such tools as hands and\nlanguage. We cannot see like a hawk or track like a dog or hear like a\nhunted deer ; but we can see a Rembrandt picture and feel the thrill of a\nBeethoven sonata or a great poem. And surely it is noteworthy that just\nhere our sensitivity passes beyond the realm of mere observation into that\nof feeling ;\nbeyond the facts that you observe there is the sense of other\nthings, not fully known, which have value and importance. I have already\nnoticed that our faculty of telepathy, such as it is, seems to operate best\nin just those spheres where our normal instrument, language, either fails\nor works with difficulty. It is certain, I suppose, that there still are more\nthings in heaven and earth than are at present mastered by science. And\nBergson has reminded us that millions of men have lived for thousands\nof years in a world vibrating with electricity, without ever suspecting\nthat there was such a thing. Are we not probably now in the presence\nand under the influence of unknown forces, forces concerned with deeper\nor more remote values or beauties or loyalties, which are beyond the\nrange of our exact knowledge and power of definition, but by no means\nbeyond the reach of an undefined but strong and even passionate feeling :\n\" This is what I value,\" \" This is what I love,\" \" This is what I must obey \";\nor negatively, \" This is what I reject.\" I suspect that what we call\ngenius is a special sensitiveness in this region of art, poetry, thought and\nthe like : a sensitiveness which according to many critics is apt to be\ndeadened and disregarded by our all-absorbing material civilisation, and\nif so, is disregarded at our peril. It is in that region that our great tool,\nlanguage, fails us and we have most highly developed our ancient pre-\nlinguistic or supra-linguistic sympathy. If this is so, it may well be that\nWilliam James was right in his forecast that the work of this Society may\nultimately render great service to the religious gropings of the human\nmind.\n\f\fOFFICERS AND COUNCIL FOR 1952\nPresident\nGilbert Murray, O.M., LL.D., Litt.D., F.B.A.\nVice-Presidents\nL.
