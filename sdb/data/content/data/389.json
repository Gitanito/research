He was educated at Borderstone Grammar School, then received a science degree from the London School of Economics and an MPhil from Goldsmiths, University of London. In the 1950s, he worked in public relations and management and as a magazine editor. He then turned to full-time writing and publishing, establishing his own firm Malcom Publications.   Psychical Research\n\nGreen became interested in the paranormal in 1944 when, on a visit with his father to an unoccupied Victorian house in Montpelier Road, Ealing (now demolished), he sensed a voice telling him to throw himself out of an upstairs window.1 &nbsp;He believed that a photograph that he took of the window showed the face of the ghost of a young girl. He later discovered that the property had been the site of several suicides during the last sixty years.\n\nIn 1949, following two years national service, Green founded the Ealing Society for Psychical Phenomena and undertook investigations of haunted houses, ESP and spirit mediums.  Beliefs and Activities\n\nGreen, a convinced humanist, stressed the need for a rational approach to haunting phenomena. He did not believe they were evidence of post-mortem survival, maintaining instead that they were often purely psychological in origin, based on optical illusions and misperceptions, or caused by a combination of telepathy, psychokinesis and electromagnetic energy.\n\nIn 1956, he investigated the case of Shirley Hitchings, the \u2018poltergeist girl of Battersea\u2019, in the course of which he received a letter claiming to originate from the girl\u2019s possessing spirit, Donald Capet, \u2018an illegitimate son of a member of the French monarchy\u2019. This won an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as the only known letter from a poltergeist.&nbsp; It did not impress Green, but he was unable to explain some seemingly psychokinetic phenomena that he observed in the girl\u2019s presence.\n\nIn April 1996, Green was asked by a public relations consultant Mark Borkowski to investigate tales of haunting phenomena at&nbsp;London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall. He arrived with equipment to try to trace any anomalies, but the ensuing press attention made serious investigation impossible.2\n\nThe first of his many books, Our Haunted Kingdom, a directory of recent ghost sightings, was published in 1972. In the following year he published Ghost Hunting: A Practical Guide, which went through many editions and is credited with having popularized the&nbsp;use by ghost hunters of instruments, from simple thermometers to tape recorders and sophisticated electronic equipment. Later books gave accounts of haunting reports, particularly in the south of England.\n\nHe was in demand for advice by people who believed they were experiencing paranormal phenomena, for which he was often able to find reassuringly normal explanations. His activities were frequently mentioned in the media, which dubbed him a \u2018secular exorcist\u2019 and \u2018spectre inspector\u2019.\n\nGreen gave courses and lectures on aspects of psychical research, giving evening classes at Pyke House, Battle on behalf of Hastings College of Further Education.\n\nHe was voted honorary president of the Borderline Science Investigation Group (now defunct) and was honoured by the Ghost Club for his lifetime of work in psychical research.\n\nThe novelist James Herbert acknowledged Green as the inspiration for the parapsychologist Chris Bishop in his novel The Dark.
