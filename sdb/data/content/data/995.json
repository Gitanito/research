Gladstone\r\n Other titles: Psychic Gazette\r\n 1913--1935  Monthly\r\n High Holborn, London, England.  \r\nPublisher: International Psychic Gazette, Ltd.  \r\nEditor: John Lewis (1861- ), founder and editor, Paschal Forthuny, continental editor; Felicia Rudolphina Scatcherd (\"Felix Rudolf\"); Frederick L. Rawson ?).\r\n Corporate author:  International Club for Psychical Research\r\n 1\/1, June 1912-23\/262, July 1935.  16 pp., 7-8\/ ($2.00) a year.\n\nThe journal began as the organ of the International Club for Psychical Research with short accounts of the conferences and seances held at the Club's rooms, together with notes on palmistry, feminism (\"The Mystical and Ethical Side of the Feminist Movement\"), the occult, etc., and articles on and by Julia Seton Sears, Frederic Thurston, E. Katherine Bates, et al.  The first issue carried the greetings of Annie Besant.  In February of the next year, Lewis, a university-educated Scotsman, lamented that he had been left with the sole responsibility for the journal and announced that it would \"no longer be confined in its scope by being the official organ of a single club.  This leaves us free to accept invitations from the other psychical and philosophical organisations in London.\"  Soon thereafter Lewis sought to sell shares in the journal (at 1 pound) to \"assist in its business development,\" a venture that was presumably successful since the journal continued for another 20 years.  Publication was suspended for a period during the War.  The journal contained contributions by J.J. Morse, David Gow, J.M. Peebles, W.J. Colville, W.H. Evans, Horace Leaf, Lilian Whiting (on \"Evangeline S. Adams: Astrologer and Seer\"), and a variety of contemporary mediums and seers, and regular contributions by Scatcherd and Lewis.  It also published articles and letters from Conan Doyle (Lewis had buttressed Doyle's accounts of fairies with his own collection of anecdotes), and by Christmas Humphreys.  The advertisement for the journal in Azoth, December 1917 says: \"It is Bright and Broad in Outlook and discusses every phase of Psychical Research, Spiritualism, Clairvoyance, Psychometry, Spirit Photography, and the various Occult Arts and Sciences.\"  Among the topics covered were Annie Besant, reincarnation (the editor did not approve), palmistry, Annie Bright, J.M. Peebles, Julia Seton Sears, spirit photography, materializations, etc.  The journal had an early interest in Bahai as did many occult groups of the time (Lewis had earlier met Abdu'l-Baha in Egypt) and for a decade published articles on Bahai.  It also introduced Sri Ramana Maharshi to the British Public in articles by Frank Humphreys.
