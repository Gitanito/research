He took his B.A. Degree at Cambridge in 1865, gradu-\nating as Senior Wrangler. The same year he was first Smith's\nprizeman, and in 1866 he became a Fellow of Trinity College.\nThis position he held until the time of his marriage in 1871\nto Evelyn, daughter of IVIr. James Maitland Balfour of Whittinge-\nhame, and sister of the Rt. Hon. A. J. Balfour. Two of their\nsons survive him\u2014Robert, his successor in the title, now\n\f2 Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S. [part\nProfessor of Physics in the Imperial College, South Kensington ;\nand Arthur, who through the War has served with the Grand\nFleet.\nHe lived at TerUng Place in Essex until 1879, when, on\nMaxwell's death, he accepted the invitation to become Caven-\ndish Professor of Physics at Cambridge, a post which he held\nuntil 1884. This same year he took part as President, at\nMontreal, in the first meeting of the British Association outside\nthese islands.\nIn 1887 he became Secretary of the Royal Society, an\noffice retained until 1896 ; he was Professor of Natural Philo-\nsophy in the Royal Institution from 1887 to 1905 ; and he\nheld the high office of President of the Royal Society from\n1905 to 1908. In this latter year he became Chancellor of\nthe University of Cambridge, in succession to the eighth\nDuke of Devonshire. He was closely connected with the\nNational Physical Laboratory from the time of its foundation,\nfirst as Chairman of the Treasury Committee appointed to\nreport on the desirability of establishing the Laboratory,\nthen as chairman of the Executive Committee, an office\nwhich he held almost up to the time of his death.\nHe acted as adviser to the Government on a number of\nscientific matters, such as electrical units, explosives, aero-\nnautics, acoustical questions, and many others. In fog-\nsyrens and other marine safety applicances he was adviser\nto the Trinity House.\nIn 1905 he became a Privy Councillor ; he was also one\nof the first members of the Order of Merit. In 1904 he was\nawarded a Nobel Prize ; the Royal Society gave him the\nCopley, the Royal, and the Rumford medals ; he was an\nOfficer of the Legion of Honour, Foreign Member of the\nInstitute of France, and of many British and Foreign Scientific\nSocieties, while he received degrees from numerous Universities\nat home and abroad.\nAt Cambridge he commenced that great series of Electrical\nMeasurements which established on an accurate basis the\nsystem of Electrical Units to which the jsrogress of Electrical\nEngineering is so greatly due. ... In his later work he had\nthe assistance of his sister-in-law, Mrs. Sidgwick, and with her\ncarried out his classical measurements on the Silver Volta-\n\fLxxix.] In Memory of Lord Rayleigh, O.M., F.R.S. 3\nmeter and the Latimer Clark Cell, thus establishing definitely\nthe units of resistance, current, and electromotive force.\nThese researches illustrated in a marked degree Lord\nRayleigh's genius as an experimental physicist. The apparatus\nemployed, except when high precision was required, was of\nthe simjolest ; that which came nearest to hand was utilised ;\nand, whether at the Cavendish Laboratory or at his private\nlaboratory at Terling, visitors were astonished at the means\nby which results of surprising accuracy\u2014accuracy which has\nonly been further substantiated by more elaborate research\nwere reached. . . .\nAll his investigations were marked by the same character-\nistics\u2014a clear grasji of principles\u2014a fearless courage in attack-\ning difficulties, and a firm determination to reach the truth.\nFor many years past he has been recognised and revered as\nthe leader of Enghsh Physical Science. The public knew\nhim but Uttle ; we who were proud to be his pupils and\nhis helpers realise only too sadly the greatness of our loss.\nWith those words, so far as applicable, I heartily\nassoicate myself ; and I append some critical observations,\nmade in the columns of Nature by his great successor\nin the chair of experimental Physics at Cambridge, Sir\nJ. J. Thomson, President of the Royal Society and now\nMaster of Trinity College, Cambridge.\nFor more than fifty years Lord Rayleigh put forth without\nany interruption, and without a trace of diminution in quality\nor quantity, a succession of researches covering almost every\nbranch of the older physics. He must during his career have\npublished nearly 400 papers ; not '\none of these is common-\nplace, and there is not one which does not raise the level\nof our knowledge of its subject. \" Collected Papers \" are apt to\nform a kind of memorial tablet in our libraries to men of\nscience, but, if I may judge from my own experience, Rayleigh's\nare a remarkable exception ; there are few, if any, books\nwhich I consult more frequently than these volumes and froni\nwhich I derive greater delight and benefit. No small part\nof this is due to the clearness and finish with which they\nare written.\nRayleigh had, like Kirchhoff, the spirit and feeling of the\nArtist in the preparation and presentation of his papers. His\n\f4 Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S. [part\nmathematical analysis seemed to flow naturally into the most\nconcise and elegant form, and, whatever might be the difficulty\nof the subject, it was never increased by any obscurity or\nambiguity as to the meaning of the writer. This quality\nwas so ingrained that it could resist the rush and excitement\nof a competition as keen as that of the Mathematical Tripos ;\nfor Avhen he was Senior Wrangler in the Tripos for 1865,\none of the examiners said : Sti'utt's papers were so good that\nthey could have been sent straight to press without revision.\nAnother feature brought out by this collection of papers\nis their catholicity. The papers are indexed under the headings\nMathematics, General Mechanics, Elastic Solids, Capillarity,\nHydrodynamics, Sound, Thermodynamics, Kinetic Theory of\nGases, Properties of Gases, Electricity and Magnetism, Optics,\nMiscellaneous ; and there is such a goodly array under each\nof these headings that it is difficult to decide in which branch\nf)f physics his work was the most important. . . .\nWhatever may be the subject of the paper, some character-\nistics are always apparent. One of these is the quite ex-\nceptional power Rayleigh possessed of seeing what was the\nessence of the question ; he always Avent straight for the\ncritical spot. Another\u2014perhaps to a considerable extent the\nresult of the last\u2014was the remarkable gain in clearness any\nsubject acquired after it had passed through his mind, which\nwas like a filter which cleared every subject passing through\nit from obscurity and error. . . .\nAnother characteristic was the soundness of his judgment.\nI question if in this respect he has ever been surpassed ;\nhis mind was crystalline, not affected by any cloud of pre-\njudice ; he did not dislike or shy at an idea because it was\nnew, neither did he think that because it was new it was\nnecessarily better than the old: ...\nHis book on the Theory of Sound may be said to have\nfound the subject bricks and left it marble ; it is ideal.\nFinally, concerning his public spirit, and willingness to\nsacrifice time in working with others, Sir J. J. Thomson\nwell says :\nThough Rayleigh disliked even more than most men the\nloss of time inseparable from attendance at committees and\nmeetings, he took his full share of such work, and it has\n\fLxxix.] In Memory of Lord Eayleigh, O.M., F.R.S. 5\nbeen a great thing for British science to be able to call to\nits councils a man whose judgment was never influenced by\nprejudice or by a shadow of self-seeking.\nTo these authoritative utterances I must add words\nof my own. It is difficult to convey to the general\npublic the enthusiastic admiration felt by mathematicians\nand physicists for Rayleigh's work. It is as distinguished\nfor neatness as for power. His well prepared mind drove\nstraight to the heart of a problem, and his mathematical\nmachinery was polished and copious enough to be able\nto attack almost any problem however abstruse.\nHis papers are necessarily abstruse, and he was some-\ntimes a little discouraged by the way in which at the\ntime they sometimes seemed to fall flat, merely because\nthere were so few who could fully understand them. That\nis a real difficulty felt by those who are working on the\nheights of science, the atmosphere is bleak and cold.\nPure mathematicians do try to encourage each other, and\ncordially express admiration for each other's work ; but\nit has hardly been the custom for applied mathematicians\nto do so. In time no doubt the papers get read,\u2014at\nleast whenever someone is working on the same precise\nbranch of a subject,\u2014and then the beauty and clarity\nand power of the treatment are impressive, but even now\nseveral of the papers have hardly attracted any attention.\nAnd once when I spoke to him with admiration about\nhis treatment of Capillarity on the mathematical side, he\nsaid I was the first person who appeared to have noticed\nit, certainly the first who had spoken to him about it.\nProbably he felt that he was to a great extent writing\nfor posterity, and he took pains to collect together his\nwritings up to 1910, in five substantial volumes, thereby\nrendering a great service to future science, and performing\na task which is often left to executors, and is not alwavs\nvery satisfactorily performed.\nHis writings show signs of real study of the work of\nothers, and copious reading ; he was well acquainted\nwith the work of foreigners, and often took up some\nsubject which they had begun in a suggestive manner,\nbut left in an unfinished and loose condition. His work\n\f6 Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S. [part\nin science might always be said to have been a clearing\nup after other people : he took the half-begun problem\nor the half-asked question, re-examined it from the\nbeginning, and carried it through to a sort of perfection.\nSo that when he had finished, it would remain for a later\ngeneration, in the light of further advance and a general\nrise of the tide of scientific knowledge, to carrj the\nmatter any further.\nScientific men in all countries are constantly making\nuse of Rayleigh's theorems, or Rayleigh's mathematical\nexpressions, and seldom indeed do they fail to stand the\ntest of subsequent impersonal scrutiny.\nIf asked for specific instances of his discoveries it is\nnot easy to pick out jewels from the setting. Argon is\nthe one achievement which can stand out in the general\nmind, because it is so easily intelligible. In that respect\nit is like the discovery of Neptune. The planet before\ndiscovery was trembling on the lines of mathematical\nanalysis, as Argon was trembling in the balance during\nthe delicate long-continued weighings which detected its\nexistence. Both were felt by recondite means, then\nhunted down, found, and named.\nAdams and Leverrier had the assistance of Galle of\nBerlin in ferreting out the stranger planet. Rayleigh had\nthe cooperation of Ramsay in actually bringing the\nstranger element to birth ; but the discovery and pioneer\nwork were Rayleigh's. Says Sir J. J. Thomson, :\n\" Though\nboth shared in running down the hare, it was Rayleigh\nalone who started it ; and this not by a happy accident\nor by the application of new and more powerful methods\nthan those at the disposal of his predecessors, but by\nthat of the oldest of chemical methods\u2014the use of the\nbalance.\"\nRamsay discovered so many other gases, helium, neon,\nkrypton, etc., and left so deep and abiding a mark on\nChemistry, that his disciples can afl^ord to be generous\nand recognise that Argon was discovered by physical\nmeans.\nRayleigh had done all but the consummation of the work,\nand would undoubtedly have discovered the atmospheric\n\fLxxix.] In Memory of Lord Rayleigh, O.M., F.R.S. 7\ngas alone, had he not by a friendly letter in Nature\nbeen understood to invite the cooperation of his chemical\nconfreres at a certain stage of the research. Most men\nwho had gone as far as he had then gone would have\nbeen ready to announce something like a conclusion, but\nRayleigh's caution is proverbial and that was not his way.\nSo also when he treated of our kind of investigation,'\nhis cautious habit and deferred judgment prevented his\nexpressing himself in language other than that to which\nhe was accustomed. What he has said ought to carry\nweight among other scientific men, as coming from him\nbut to the public his utterance may sound hesitating\nand doubtful and inconclusive. When he had thoroughly\nworked a thing out, and elaborated his mathematical\nexposition, he could be clear and definite enough. One\nor two examples may be used as illustrations.\nLord Rayleigh's explanation of the blue of the sky\nthough it differs only in detail from previous ideas, is\na great improvement upon them in every way; 'and\nhe worked out accurately what had previously heen only\nvague. This is typical of his work. It was known that\nthe blue must be caused by small separate particles\nsmaller than the waves of light, so that they are able\nto affect the smallest waves most, reflecting the waves\nwhich cause the sensation of blue more than the red or\nthe green, but it was thought that the particles which\ndid this must consist of a fine grade of dust; and there\nwas no accurate or complete theory. (As a side issue\nwe may remember that Mr. Ruskin rebelled aesthetically\nagainst anything so beautiful as the sky being caused bv\nthe suspension of foreign matter, or anything that could\nbe called \" dust,\" however fine. Fogs and mists and clouds\nmignt be so caused but not sky-blue.) Lord Rayleigh\nexamined the subject mathematically and proved that the\ndispersing or scattering particles which selected and\nreflected the smaflest waves of light were of atomic\ndimensions, and were accordingly the very molecules of\nair itself.\nAmong other simple and yet typical investigations are\nthe explanation of the twinkling of stars at rising and\n\fSir Oliver Lodge, F.R.8. [part\nsetting and the complete theory of the colours of opal.\nOpalescent colours had been thought of as some modifica-\ntion of the colours of thin plates\u2014which are simple to\nexplain but are by comparison of coarse and unattractive\nappearance\u2014but Rayleigh found the colours of opal and\nother crystals, Chlorate of Potash, among others, were\nsingularly pure in tone and could only be explained by\nreflexion from a succession of equidistant strata, each of\nwhich reflected a barely perceptible amount and yet which\nin the aggregate reflected quite a fair proportion of hght,\u2014\nof hght whose wave length depended on the distance of\nthe strata apart.\nHe illustrated it by a screen of muslin disks at regular\ndistances one behind another, employed as a reflector,\nor even a generator, at any rate a selector, of a, high\npitched note. The theory has since been apphed to\ninvestigate the structure of crystals by X-rays, and even\nto the constitution of atoms.\nThe regular arrangement of molecules in a crystal give\nrise to stratifications which reveal their dimensions by\nthe wave length of the radiation which they reflect.\nThe twinkling of stars low in the horizon might easily\nseem an indefinite and so to speak lawless phenomenon,\nlike the flickering of flames. But nothing is lawless in\nreality, and a rising star twinkles one way, while a setting\nstar \"twinkles another way; and if they be examined\nspectroscopically, obstruction bands are seen to move down\nor up the spectrum, from right to left for a rising, and\nfrom left to right for a setting star.\nParticles or irregularities ui the earth's lower atmosphere\nare responsible, in combination v\/ith the rotation of the\nearth\nAll manner of comparatively insignificant phenomena\nattracted his attention\u2014and after he had dealt with\nthem they ceased to be insignificant, but revealed un-\nsuspected beauties. Near the end of his life he was working\nat the colour of beetles' wings\u2014as always, with a com-\nbination of accurate observation, careful experiment, and\nrefined mathematical analysis. These were his weapons\nand with them he achieved his success.\n\fLxxix.] In Memorij of Lord Rmjleigh, O.M., F.R.S. 9\nThe examples chosen for mention here are chosen for\ntheir simplicity and inteUigibility. To give any idea of\nLord Rayleigh's mathematical power, and of the way ui\nwhich he apphed it over the whole realm of physics, is\nhopeless. Senior students and professors of Physics will\nfind a wealth of material in the five volumes and future\nsupplementary volume of Collected Papers for many years\nto come.\nAnd then there is his Theori\/ of Sound. The two\nvolumes of this work stand out as a landmark in science.\nNothing more complete has been done, and the results\nobtained for the acoustic vibration of gases and solids\nare applicable to electrical vibrations also ;\nbut the\nvolumes are stiU more general, they contain the mathe-\nmatical theory of vibration in general, and of waves-\nwaves at least of the longitudinal type. Light waves are\ndealt with in a compressed and unfortunately shortened\narticle in the last volume of the ninth edition of the\nEncydo'paedia Britannica.\nWhat about his work on our subject? Many members\nwiU remember his brilliant and humorous address when\nhe did us the honour of accepting our Presidential Chair.\nHe was more impressed with what we call a physical\nphenomenon than with those which are purely psychic. He\nhad not paid much attention or devoted much first-hand\nexperiment to the ordinary phenomena of automatic writing\nand trance utterance. He knew about them, of course,\nas he knew of our experiments in telepathy, but they did\nnot seem to drive home the security of conviction which\nhis cautious mind required.\nThings he could see and handle impressed him more.\nThe evidence for telepathy he apparently thought not\nquite conclusive ;\nthough he made the remarkable state-\nment that, given irrefragable evidence for telepathy\nbetween living persons, he would have no difficulty m\nextending it to telepathy from the dead. Few of us at\nany time could have said anything like that. For myself,\nat\"^ any rate, long ago in the eighties of last century,\ntelepathy from the living was one thing, telepathy from\nthe dead quite another. I regarded thought transference\n\f10 Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S. [part\nas fairly well established ; \u2014the activity, the existence\neven, of dead people, I confess I did not then believe in.\nIt was through the mediumship of Mrs. Piper in 1889\nthat the larger question began to force itself on my\nattention.\nI am not sure whether Lord Rayleigh had sittings\nwith Mrs. Piper, and other mediums of that kind, or\nnot. But he did have sittings with physical mediums,\nand he was non-plussed by the results obtained. Well\ninstructed about fraud, there were phenomena which he\nobserved\u2014in his few sittings with Eusapia for instance\n\u2014\nwhich the fraud hypothesis did not explain ; and he\nnever gave way to the easy temptation of rejecting every-\nthing wholesale : although it is true the things which he\nhad an opportunity of seeing were small compared with\nsome of the things which I myself saw.\nCaution indeed he possessed in an eminent degree, but\nhe was cautious about rejecting, and not only cautious\nabout accepting. He realised that what we were re-\nsponsible for was careful statement of truth, and that\nit was as posssible to err on the popular negative side as\non the unpopular and difficult positive side. It is easy to\nobtain credit in the scientific world for strong sense and\nrobust intelligence by wholesale denials, and such an\nattitude is politic in our day and generation ; but pro-\ngress in knowledge can only be made if some pioneers\nat any rate are willing to run the risk of harbouring\nstrange guests of knowledge, and of declaring themselves\nconvinced about new facts, while still their acceptance is\nregarded as a sign of feeble brain and lax character.\nThat Lord Rayleigh was as convinced about physical\nphenomena of heterodox type as some of us have gradually\ngrown to be, cannot be said. That he was more convinced\nthan others of us, is, I think, true. But what I am sure\nof is that if he were absolutely convinced of any fact\n\u2014\nand it took a good deal to convince him\u2014he would\nstand up for the truth in any assembly in the world,\nand not be debarred from utterance for fear of damaged\nreputation. This may sound easier than it is.\nBut the reputation of a scientific man is a delicate\n\fLxxix.] In Memory of Lord Eayleigh, O.M., F.R.S. 11\ngrowth. None but his fellows can appreciate his work\n;\nthe popular notion of him must depend upon their\nopinion, in the long run ; and if skiUed opinion turn\nagainst him his day is done. So it was with Thomas\nYoung, in the early years of last century : in spite of\nhis brilliant pioneer work, as we now see it to have\nbeen,\u2014one of the great men of science of all time,\u2014he\nwas intellectually killed by Lord Brougham and other\ncontemporary critics, and at the present day is practically\nunknown except among physicists. Through such criticism\nanother of our Presidents, Sir WilHam Crookes, had to go,\nand who shall say that he was not weakened thereby as\nwell as distressed. Through such criticism Lord Rayleigh\ndid not have to go ; he was never suiificiently and com-\npletely persuaded about our phenomena to find it necessary\nto declare himself coratn populo. But he did take a keen\ninterest in our subject ; he acted on the Committee of\nReference and passed papers for publication ; and at\nlength he allowed himself to occupy the Presidential\nChair, and in his Presidential Address he exposed his\nviews. Would that we could have retained longer his\nripe judgment and penetrating intellect, his cautious\ncandour, and truly religious spirit.\nHe was the last of the giants of the Victorian Era in\nPhysical Science\u2014Stokes, Thomson and Tait, Clerk Maxwell\nand Rayleigh. Cambridge may well be proud of its\nalumni. From the days of Isaac Newton to the present\nday, it has magnificently upheld the fiag of Mathematical\nPhysics ; and from no University in the world have\ngreater men in this branch of science ever emanated.\n\f12 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nII.\nIN MEMORY OF\nSIR WILLmi CROOKES, O.M., F.R.S.\nBy Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S.\nWe have to mourn the loss of another President of our\nSociety who was also a most eminent scientific man.\nSir William Crookes passed into the unseen on April 4th,\n1919, in the eighty-seventh year of his age, and scientific\nmen in every country throughout the world mourned the\nloss of one of the most famous and indefatigable workers\nin physical science. He possessed\u2014as Sir J. J. Thomson,\nPresident of the Royal Society, truly remarked\u2014unsur-\npassed experimental skill and the instinct of selecting\nthose particular subjects of enquiry which enabled him\nto be a pioneer in perhaps a greater variety of subjects\nthat any sava7it of the past century. Moreover, Crookes'\nfearless courage as a pioneer, his independence of spirit,\nand his liberahty of thought, were coupled with the\nsincerity and modesty of a truly great man, whilst his\nhigh principle and affectionate nature made his character\nas beautiful as his fame was great.\nThis is not the place to review in detail the wonderful\nrecord of chemical and physical researches and discoveries\nwith which Crookes has enriched science. It may, how-\never, be of interest to notice very briefly his life history\nand some of the scientific work on which his enduring\nfame will rest.\nCrookes was born on June 17th, 1832, at 143 Regent\nStreet, London, where his father had established a\nsuccessful business. Surely we owe it to posterity to\nmark the place of birth and residence of famous scientiiic\n\fSIR WILLIAM CROOKES, O.M., F.K.S.\n\f:\ni\n\fI.XXIX.] In Memonj of Sir William Crookes, O.M., Etc. 13\nmen more frequently than is now done. A tablet should\n\"be placed on the house in Regent Street and also on the\nhouse in Kensington Park Gardens, where Crookes died,\nand where he lived from 1880 and conducted most of his\nresearches. That house (according to Crookes' statement\nto an interviewer) was the first ever lit with the electric\nlicrht all the glow lamps having been made by Crookes\nhfmself, he having been one of the first to bring our\npresent electric lamps to practical success, an honour\nwhich he shares with another member of our Council,\nMr. Lane Fox-Pitt.\nCrookes had no university training, and very httle\nregular school education; he studied chemistry at the\nold Royal College of Chemistry in Oxford Street, under\nProfessor Hofmann ; a place I know well, for twelve\nyears later I was a humble student in the same college\nunder the .\nsame eminent Professor. Only three years after\nCrookes had entered the CoUege of Chemistry, in 1851, he\npubhshed his first scientific paper, which at once attracted\nattention both in England and Germany and marked the\nauthor as a new and promising young chemist. Crookes\nwas then assistant to Professor Hofmann, a position be\nretained till 1854, when he was appointed superintendent\nof the meteorological department of the Observatory at\nOxford, and the following year became lecturer of\nChemistry in Chester Training College.\nIn 1856 Crookes married and settled in London, at\nMornington Road, Regents Park, moving in 1880 to\n7 Kensington Park Gardens, where, at his own expense,\nhe built and equipped a fine chemical laboratory. Crookes\nhad eight children,\u2014of whom four sons and one daughter\nare now living. Those of us who attended the funeral\nof Lady Crookes in 1917 and saw the stricken husband,\nfelt that Sir Wilham would never recover from the loss\nof one who had been his devoted partner for sixty-one\nyears. Nevertheless with rare courage, though with\nenfeebled health, he returned to scientific work in his\neighty-fifth year and wrested fresh secrets from the\nillimitable storehouse of nature.\nThe first great discovery which Crookes made (in 1861)\n\f14 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nwas of a new element, a metal he called Thallium^\nfrom the green line it showed when its vapour was\nexamined in the spectroscope. This splendid instrument\nof research had then recently been discovered, and it\nwas Crookes' right-hand all his life. He became in fact\nthe greatest living authority on spectroscopy, so much so\nthat when the gases argon and helium were discovered by\nRayleigh and Ramsay, they submitted specimens of these\ngases to Crookes to examine ; he determined their novelty,\nand the identity of helium with a new element previously\nfound in the sun.\nThe revelation of a new element sixty years ago was\na great event, and Crookes' discovery of Thallium created\nworld-wide interest. He isolated the element, and found it\nto be a soft white metal very like lead, and it was exhibited\nin this state, at the great Exhibition in London in 1862. For\nmany years Crookes exhaustively studied the chemistry of\nThallium, he found its various compounds, and with infinite\nlabour determined its atomic weight. This arduous task\nrevealed to the scientific world the singular experimental skill,\nand the wonderful accuracy of Crookes' work. For in spite\nof more recent attempts, and more modern appliances, the\natomic weight which Crookes found, still ranks as the most\ncorrect.\nIt was in the course of the exceedingly delicate weighings\nin vacuo, which were necessary for the determination of\nthe atomic weight that Crookes discovered a new fact,\nRepulsion by radiation in high vacua. This led him to the\nconstruction in 1875 of the famous Radiometer. This is a\nlittle mill, the delicate horizontal vanes of which are in\nvacuo, and rapidly rotate when exposed to light. The\nmotion, however, is not due, as first thought, to the mechanical\neffect of light, but to the heating of the blackened face of the\nvanes, which causes a repulsion of the residual molecules of\nair within the exhausted vessel, and thus the vanes are kicked\nback ; a continuous motion being sustained by the cooling\nof the air molecules on the surface of the glass vessel.\nThe very high exhaustion of glass vessels\u2014which\nCrookes carried to a higher state than had ever before\nbeen achieved\u2014led him in 1876, to his next discovery.\n\fLxxix.] In Memory of Sir William Croakes, Q.M., Etc. 15\nperhaps one of the most far-reaching and epoch-m.aking\nin the history of experimental physics; Crookes found\nthat when an electric discharge passed throii^h -these ve'-y\nhighly exhausted glass vessels, the residual gas within, tiie^ .\nglass vessel was revealed in a new or, as he called it, a\nfourth state of matter ; neither solid, liquid, nor gaseous.\nThe stream of these infinitely minute and ultra-molecular\ncorpuscles, driven from the cathode, or negative pole,\nby the electric discharge behaved like a beam of light ;\nthey threw sharp shadows of any obstacle in their path,\nand they could be reflected and converged to a focus\nby means of a concave mirror. Objects placed at this\nfocus were raised to intense heat, and even platinum\nmight be melted. Precious stones when thus bombarded\nby these ultra-gaseous molecules, showed characteristic and\nbrilliant phosphorescence, whilst the walls of the glass\ntube on which these cathode rays fell glowed with a\ngreen phosphorescence, now familiar to us in the X-ray\ntubes. In fact, Crookes' \"radiant matter,\" or cathode rays,\nbecame, later on, the source of Rontgen's discovery of the\nso-called X-rays, these being generated by the impact\nof the cathode rays upon a suitable anode.\nSome twenty years after Crookes' discovery of the\ncathode rays a telegram in the Times newspaper, at the\nend of the year 1895, announced Rontgen's discovery of\nthe X-rays, to which many substances opaque to light\nwere perfectly transparent. I happened to have had in\nmy possession for many years a small very high vacvium\ntube Crookes had made and given me, which showed\nthe green phosphorescence just referred to.^ After reading\nthe telegraphic report in the Times I coimected up my\nlittle \" Crookes tube \" with an induction coil and succeeded\nafter a long exposure in taking a photograph, or radio-\ngraph, of my spectacles when they were enclosed in their\n1 This small vacuum tube had the two platinum electrodes about aa\ninch apart and was made for the j'lu'pose of showing that at the very\nhigh vacua Crookes obtained the electric discharge would not pass even\nfrom a coil giving a 12 -inch spark in air. In course of time its vacuum\nbecame less, a discharge passed causing a brilliant green phosphorescence\non the walls of the tube around the anode.\n\f16 ,\n. Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nopaque cardboard case. The metal rims were clearly seen\nand also the glass lenses faintly indicated.\n.Early in 189.6 a Dublin surgeon brought a patient from\nhis hospital to my laboratory, in the hope that I might\nbe able to detect, by a delicate magnetometer, the position\nof a broken needle that the patient, a maid-servant, had\nrun into her hand a year before. The broken needle had\ntravelled since its entrance and was now crippling the\nuse of the patient's hand. Repeated attempts to find and\nremove the broken needle had failed ; the magnetometer\nshowed the needle was there but failed to locate its\nexact position. Having had a rudimentary X-ray tube\nmade, I succeeded in obtaining a good radiograph of the\nexact position of the needle, which the surgeon thereupon\nremoved and the patient recovered the use of her hand.\nThis was I believe the first application of the X-rays for\nsurgical purposes ; and it shows how narrowly Crookes\nmissed the discovery made later on by Rontgen.\nThe dark space which appears round the negative or\ncathode pole in a vacuum tube is known as the \" Crookes\nspace,\" and in the Bakerian lecture which Crookes gave\nbefore the Royal Society in 1883, he considered that the\ncathode rays, or particles of \" radiant matter \" discharged\nfrom the cathode, were of the dimensions of molecules. It\nbecame clear to Crookes a little later on that these\nparticles were ulfra-molecular, and were indeed the in-\nfinitely minute corpuscles, called by Dr. Johnstone Stoney\nElectrons ; and this he expressed in his paper on the\n\" Stratification of Hydrogen,\" published in Proc. Eoyal\nSociety, vol. 79. With wonderful prevision he wrote\nnearly forty years ago :\n\" We seem at length to have\nwithin our grasp, and obedient to our control, the little\nindivisible particles which constitute the physical basis\nof the elements,\" and he goes on to say, \" we have\nactually touched the borderland between the known and\nthe unknown which for me has always had a peculiar\ntemptation. I venture to think (he adds) that the\ngreatest scientific problems of the future will find their\nsolution in this borderland or even beyond.\"\nThis prediction has a double aspect, for so far as\n\fLxxix.] In Memory of Sir William Crookes, O.M., Etc. 17\npsychical phenomena are concerned Crookes kimself spent\nfour years in exploring the borderland between the known\nand the unknown ; and as regards physical phenomena\nCrookes' cathode rays have become the starting point of\na series of astonishing discoveries of great practical and\ntheoretical importance.\nCrookes\" scientific prevision is further seen in the belief\nhe publicly expressed, and to which he was led from his\nspectroscopic researches, that the so-called elements might\nbe resolved into a few simpler types, which he termed\nmeta-elements, and that therefore the alchemists' dream\nof the transmutation of metals might after all prove to\nbe true. Years later Ramsay and Rutherford proved\nthat this was no dream, and established the disintegration\nof the radio-active elements into bodies of lower atomic\nweight. Crookes himself was, I believe, the first to discover\nthat the element helium could be obtained from the\ndisintegration of radium.\nThe discovery of radio-activity by Becquerel and of\nradium by Mdme. Curie, towards the end of the last\ncentury, led Crookes to make a series of important investi-\ngations, and to the construction of the Httle instrument\nwhich he called the Spinthariscope, whereby the alpha\nrays emanating from radium could be counted ; each\nparticle producing a scintillation on a small zinc-sulphide\nphosphorescent screen.\nCrookes' researches on the rare earths and their spectra\noccupied him for more than twenty years and led to his\nexhaustive and classical study of the element Scandium\nand its various salts. He returned to this subject at the\nclose of his life and in December, 1918\u2014only a few\nmonths before his death\u2014sent a paper on his investigation\nof the \" Arc Spectra of Scandium \" to the Royal Society.\nAs he was then eighty-six years old, this is probably\nan almost unique record of mental vigoru? and original\nresearch at so advanced an age and after such a long and\nstrenuous life.\nIn 1898 he was elected President of the British Asso-\nciation and in his presidential address at Bristol he\npointed out that a gradual exhaustion of the wheat crops\n\f18 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nof the world would occur from the want of fertilisers ;\nand hence the necessity of creating artificial fertilisers by\nthe fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. He urged that this\nshould be done on a large commercial scale to avoid a\nfuture catastrophe. The Germans took the hint and led\nthe way, and when the war came their big plants for the\nfixation of atmospheric nitrogen, were utilized for the\nproduction of explosives, otherwise their army would have\nbeen helpless. We are now turning our attention to the\nwarning Crookes gave us twenty-one years ago.\nTime will only allow me to mention in passing Crookes'\nresearches on diamonds. For this purpose he visited the\ndiamond fields in S. Africa in 1896, and again in 1905,\nand published an admirable little book on diamonds in\n1909. Crookes showed that minute crystals of diamond\ncould be obtained artificially by the explosion of cordite\nin a closed steel cylinder.\nOne other important discovery which we owe to Crookes'\nlater years, must be referred to. This was the protection\nof the eyes of glass and steel smelters from the intolerable\nglare of the molten glass or metal. Hitherto no trans-\nparent substance had been found which would cut off the\ninvisible and hurtful rays from the white hot furnace.\nCrookes' aid was sought, and at an age when most men\nwould long since have ceased to work, he threw himself\ninto this problem, and after long and painstaking research\ndiscovered a glass with onty a very slight yellow tint,\nthat cut off practically all the injurious rays. These\n\" Crookes spectacles are now widely used. He might,\nobviously, have derived very great financial benefit from\nthis discovery bvit, like all his other discoveries, he gave\nit freely to the world.\nIn reviewing the varied and prodigious amount of\noriginal scientific work accomplished by Crookes during\nhis lifetime (of which I have only given an imperfect\nsketch), it is astonishing to find that he had time, not\nonly for his protracted psychical investigations, to which I\nwill turn directly, but also for numerous other occupations.\nHis literary work was large enough to have filled most\nmen's lives. He founded, owned, and for half a century\n\fLxxix.] In Memory of Sir William Crookes, O.M., Etc. 19\nalone edited the Cheynical News, the leading chemical weekly\njournal ; for years he edited and wrote for the Quarterly\nJournal of Science. It was in this quarterly he published\nhis researches on spiritualism. He wrote a standard text\nbook on Chemical Analysis, besides numerous important\nworks on the applications of chemistry to the arts, the\nindustries and the agriculture of our country ; he edited\nin addition several technical books and numerous scientific\nreports. Nor was he a recluse, holding aloof from society;\non the contrary he was given to hospitality and enjoyed\ndining out at public functions or with friends or with the\nCouncil of the S.P.R., and for some forty years rarely\nmissed the monthly dinner of the small group of like-\nminded friends who formed the \" Ghost-Club.\"\nSir W. Tilden, F.R.S., in the long obituary notice of\nCrookes he wrote for the Royal Society, has well said :\n\" It would be almost impossible to enumerate all the\nvarious directions in which Sir William Crookes occupied\nhimself in connection with problems of public interest or\nas expert adviser to the Government, but, in passing,\nmay be mentioned his work in the disposal of town\nsewage, his Reports on the composition and quality of\ndaily samples of the water supplied to London from 1880\nto 1906, and his services as Consulting Expert on the\nOrdnance Board from 1907 onwards during the period of\nthe war. Nor should it be forgotten that the office of\nPresident is in many learned societies no sinecure. In\npresiding over the Chemical Society (1887-1889), the\nInstitution of Electrical Engineers (1890-1894), the British\nAssociation (1898), the Society of Chemical Industry (1913),\nand finally the Royal Society (1913-14-15), Sir William\npaid close attention to all the multifarious details of each\nSociety. He also served as Honorary Secretary to the\nRoyal Institution from 1900 to 1913, and was Foreign\nSecretary to the Royal Society from 1908 to 1912. Every\nman of science among his contemporaries will be read}\"\nto affirm therefore that the numerous honours which were\nshowered upon Crookes by the most distinguished Academies\nand Universities in the world were well earned and very\nfittingly conferred. He received a knighthood in 1897 and\n\f20 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.8. [part\nfrom the Royal Society the Royal, the Davy, and the\nCopley Medals ; from the Royal Society of Arts the\nAlbert Medal, and finally, in 1910, the Order of Merit\nwas conferred upon him by the King.\"\nThis, of course, is the highest honour our Sovereign can\nbestow, and it has been conferred on no less than four\nmembers of our Society. Nor must it be forgotten Crookes\nwas President of our Society from 1896 -1899, he was a\nvaluable member of our council and a contributor to\nour Proceedings. The French Academy of Sciences gave\nhim their gold medal and prize of 3000 francs and elected\nhim their correspondent in 1880. It is singular that whilst\nthe various British and Irish Universities conferred honorary\ndegrees on Crookes, the Scotch Universities appear to\nhave held aloof ; was it because of his psychical researches,\nto which we must now turn.\nCrookes' psychical investigations were so prolonged, so\nimportant and so unique that I should have preferred to\nhave devoted a special meeting of our members for their\nreview and discussion.\nOne would have thought Sir W. Crookes would have\nbeen the most unlikely man of science to take up the\ninvestigation of psychical phenomena. His hands at the\ntime were full of pressing scientific and literary work\n;\nmoreover, his somewhat austere temperament and his\npassion for exact data and extreme accuracy in all his\nexperimental researches naturally suggest that he would\nlook with scorn on the contradictory, loose and incon-\nclusive psychical evidence which existed when he began\nhis investigations. The truth no doubt is, as he stated in\nthe paper I have quoted, that the borderland between the\nknown and the unknown had always a peculiar attraction\nfor him, and hence as a patient seeker after truth he\nset to work to examine the novel and perplexing pheno-\nmena which seemed to occur in the presence of a medium-\nistic acquaintance of his own. His psychical investi-\ngations were mainly concerned with what are called the\nphysical phenomena of Spiritualism,\u2014and they engrossed\nhis attention from 1870 to 1874.\n\fLxxix.] In Memory of Sir William Crookes, O.M., Etc. 21\nIn the first paragraph of the reprint of his articles on\nthe \" Phenomena of Spirituahsm,\" Crookes tells us that\nhe \" considered it the duty of scientific men, who have\nlearnt exact modes of working, to examine phenomena\nwhich attract pubhc attention, in order to confirm their\ngenuineness or to explain the delusions of the honest, or\nto expose the tricks of deceivers.\" And Crookes adds,\n\" That certain physical phenomena such as the movement\nof material substances, and the production of sounds\nresembling electric discharges, occur under circumstances in\nwhich they cannot be explained by any physical law\nat present known, is a fact of which I am as certain,\nas I am of the most elementary laws of chemistry. My\nwhole scientific education (he continues) has been one\nlong lesson in exactness of observation, and I wish it\nto be distinctly understood that this firm conviction is\nthe result of most careful investigation.\"\nAnd yet, after this expHcit statement, by one of the\nhighest authorities in experimental science in our country,\nCrookes was ostracised by those who had never given an\nhour's serious study to the phenomena in question ! As\nis well known Crookes at first inclined to the view that\nthe phenomena were due to some new force emanating\nfrom the medium \" which for convenience,\" (he says in\nhis first paper), \" may be called the Psychic Force.'\"\nBut subsequent investigations, more especially the marvel-\nlous phenomena he witnessed with the medium Miss Cook,\nled him to accept more or less completely the Spiritualistic\npoint of view.\nIt is imnecessary to detail the remarkable series of\nexperiments which Crookes made with that gifted medium\nMr. D. D. Home, and later with Miss Cook. In the\nProceedings of the S.P.R. for 1889, Vol. VI., Sir W.\nCrookes published a lengthy paper entitled \" Notes of\nseances with D. D. Home,\" and in the discussion that\nfollowed the reading of Sir 0. Lodge's report on Eusapia\nPaladino, Crookes gave interesting details of some of the\nmore striking phenomena he had witnessed in Home's\npresence,^ such as the fire-test, the levitation of Home,\n1 See S.P.R. Journal for 1894, Vol. VI. p. 341.\n\f22 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. I\nPAKT\nand the production of \" spirit \" hands and forms. As\nregards the handling of fire Crookes says :\n\" Several times I saw the fire-test both at my own and\nat other houses. Home certainly put his hand into the\ngrate and handled the red-hot coals in a manner which\nwould have been impossible for me to have imitated with-\nout being severely burnt. I once saw him go to a bright\nwood fire and taking a large piece of red-hot charcoal,\nput it in the hollow of one hand, and covering it with\nthe other hand, blew into the extempore furnace till the\ncoal was white hot and the flames licked round his\nfingers. No sign of burning could be seen then or after-\nwards on his hands.\"\nSeveral other competent witnesses like Lord Dunraven,\nSir W. Huggins, O.M., Mr. W. M. Wilkinson, etc. have\ntestified to this fire test. Mr. S. C. Hall gave me minute\ndetails of how a white hot coal was placed on his head\nwhilst his long white hair was unsinged, and no pain was\nfelt.i\nThen as regards levitation Crookes tells us he has seen\nHome rise off the ground and that he passed his hands\nunder and around him when in the air. Several times\nthe chair on which Home sat rose up, no one being\nnear it, all present saw it, Crookes felt under the legs of\nthe chair, and Home's feet were all the time tucked up\non the chair. General Boldero, a friend of mine, and\nothers have confirmed these statements.\nAs trickery and every normal explanation are excluded\nfrom Crookes' observations there remains the only alter-\nnative, that he was hallucinated, by some subtle hypnotic\ninfluence exercised by the medium. But this has been\ncompletely disproved by eminent investigators like Lord\nCrawford, F. W. H. Myers, Lord Rayleigh and others.^ Nor\n1 If I may refer to my work On the Threshold of the Unseen,''\nthe reader will there find in Chapters IV. to VI. a brief resume of the\nmarvellous phenomena witnessed and critically examined by Sir W.\nCrookes.\n- Count Petrovo-Solovovo has ably discussed the hallucination theory\nin a paper published in Proc. S.P.B. Vol. XXI. p. 436 et seq., and\nhas shown that it is quite inadequate as an explanation of the mar-\nvelloiis phenomena witnessed by Sir W. Crookes and others.\n\fLxxix.] In Memory of Sir William Crookes, O.M., Etc. 23\ncan we say Crookes was mad, for the facts are testified\nto by scores of other sane and sensible men.\nCrookes records many other marvels which occurred\nwith Home. Thus he repeatedly saw a hfe-like human\nhand in full light take a flower from a vase and hand it\nto him. Yet there was nothing visible but the dehcate\nhand of a lady, no body was seen and no human being\nwas near.\nCrookes touched this hand repeatedly and more than once\nheld it firmly,\u2014resolved not to let it escape. There was\nno struggle but the hand melted away into vapour and\nfaded from his grasp. That was precisely my own ex-\nperience once, when I held a small, so called spirit, hand\nthat touched me. The hand pulled me upwards till I had\nto stand on a chair and then on a table in front of me,\ngrasping the hand firmly ; it suddenly faded away. Lord\nRayleigh says if Crookes was deceived by an inflated\nTubber glove, still the rubber would remain when the\nglove deflated in Crookes' hand. .\nIt must be remembered that Crookes repeatedly states\nHome always refused to sit in the dark. In fact\nthe room was so well lighted, Crookes says, that not\nonly could he see everything and write his notes, but\ncould read them when they were written. Crookes\nrecords his opinion of Home as one of the most upright,\nhonest and lovable of men, who insisted on every pre-\ncaution being taken to avoid deception. \" Don't consider\nmy feelings,\" Home once said to Crookes, \" test the\nphenomena in every way you can devise.\" No wonder\nthat we find Crookes writing, \" I think it a shame that\nwhilst Home was willing and anxious to place himself at\nthe disposal of men of science for investigations he should\nhave lived so many years in London, and, with one or\ntwo exceptions, no one of weight in the scientific world\nshould have thought it worth while to look into the truth\nor falsity of things which were being talked about in\nSociety on all sides.\" ^\n1 It is most desirable that all Crookes' notes and papers and his\ndiscussion of Home's phenomena at the S.P.R. should be carefully\ncollected and published, as the well-known American publishers, Messrs.\n\f24 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nWe must all heartily concur in this, and it is a strong-\nargument in favour of our Society, which was not founded\nuntil eight years later. But it must be remembered that\nthe success which attended all Crookes' researches, whether\nphysical or psychical were largely due to his open mind\nand fearless courage in exploring new regions. He did not,\nlike so many men, refuse to investigate what seemed\nimpossible, he followed the dictates of that distinguished\nscientific man, Sir John Herschel, who said, \" the natural\nphilosopher should believe all things not improbable, hope\nall things not impossible.'\" Nor did he hesitate to accept\nwhat he had once firmly proved. Progress in knowledge\nwould be impossible, if\u2014like a recent reviewer in our\nJournal\u2014he expressed doubts of what has already been\nestablished quite as conclusively as the existence of\nmeteorites, which were regarded as fabulous stories a\ncentury ago. On this point Lord Rayleigh made inter-\nesting and pertinent remarks in his presidential address\nto our Society.\nIn conclusion I must briefly refer to the still more\namazing phenomena Crookes carefully tested with another\nmedium. Miss F. Cook. Here an actual human form\nappeared calling itseK \" Katie King.\" Sometimes this form\nshowed itself and the medium side by side. Crookes was\nallowed to grasp the ghost and found it as substantial\nhuman body ; in fact, it appeared in all respects\nidentical with a living woman. So much so that Crookes\ntook its pulse and rate of breathing, its height, and\nexamined it minutely to see what difference there was\nbetween it and the medium. He found the figure had\na very different pulse rate, and differed in many other\nrespects. Lady Crookes has told me that she and her\nfamily repeatedly saw this ghostly lady when the medium\nstayed in their house. That it spoke to them and was\nas natural and life-like as any earthly person.\nNo wonder everybody was incredulous, and said Miss\nCook (the medium) and \" Katie,\" were the same person, or\nthat she had a clever accomplice. Hence Crookes under-\nH. Holt & Co., wish to do. I have given in an Appendix references\nto Sir W. Crookes\" contributions to our Society.\n\fLxxix.] In Memory of Sir William Crookes, O.M., Etc. 25\ntook an elaborate investigation which lasted five months,\nand which he tells us completely established that there\nwas no accomplice and that '\n' Katie King '\n' was not the\nmedium Miss Cook. He also used photography to test\nthe matter. He was himself an expert photographer and\nso was his assistant. In his laboratory he fitted up five\ncomplete sets of photographic apparatus, and each time\nhad several plates exposed in all the five cameras. These\nhe developed himself, and of course procured his own\nphotographic plates. Thus he obtained forty-four negatives\nand out of these got several excellent photographs of the\nghost \"Katie King,\" who appeared somewhat to resemble,\nbut was more beautiful, than the medium. The photo-\ngraphs were obtained by means of a couple of brilliant\narc electric lamps he had fitted up in his laboratory.\nTo test the resemblance of the ghost form to the medium\nmore accurately, Mrs. Crookes dressed the medium in a\nwhite robe similar to that worn by the materialized spirit,\nand when the latter appeared she was photographed in\nexactly the same spot, and under the same conditions,\nas the medium had previously been photographed. When\nthe two photographs were compared it was seen that\n\" Katie \" was half a head taller than the medium Miss\nCook, and was a bigger and more beautiful woman. Her\nears were not pierced whilst the medium always wore\near-rings. Previous to this Crookes had devised the most\nelaborate and admirable electrical tests, witnessed by\nseveral scientific men, which proved that the medium had\nnot moved from her place behind a ciu'tain, when the\nghost Katie appeared.\nThe soidisant Katie having told Crookes that the time\nof her final departure was near at hand, he invited 'the\nmedium to stay at his house. This she did, bringing\nonly a small unlocked hand bag with her, and was con-\nstantly under the close supervision of Mrs. Crookes. After\ndinner she was taken to Crookes' laboratory (which was\nused as a dark cabinet), and laid on a sofa or on the\nground, the outer door was locked and the key retained\nby Crookes. Between that room, which opened into\nthe library, where the observers were placed, a curtain\n\f26 Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nhung. Soon after the medium had become entranced\n\" Katie \" appeared, and when about to be photographed\nwrapped a shawl round the medium's face to prevent\ninjury from the powerful electric light. Crookes says,\n\" It was a common thing for the seven or eight of us\ninvestigators to see Miss Cook and '\nKatie ' at the same\ntime under the full blaze of the electric light. . . . We\nsaw the medium move uneasily under the influence of the\nintense light and we heard her moan occasionally. I have\none photograph of the two together, but '\nKatie '\nis\nseated in front of Miss Cook's head.\" The final disappear-\nance of \" Katie \"'\noccurred shortly afterwards, and the\naccount which Crookes and others wrote of it at the time,\nis one of the most amazing stories in the history of\nspiritualism. After \" Katie \" had invited Crookes into the\ninner room or cabinet, where Miss Cook was lying senseless\non the floor, she closed the curtain and told Miss\nCook to wake up, as she must leave her. Miss Cook\nwoke and implored \" Katie \" to stay ; this she could not\ndo, and for several minutes the two conversed ;\nthen,\nfollowing \" Katie's \" instructions, Crookes tells us he came\nforward to support Miss Cook \" who was falling on to the\nfloor sobbing hysterically. I looked round but the white\nrobed '\nKatie '\nhad gone.\" ^\nOne hesitates to express any opinion on these apparently\nincredible phenomena. They are unique in the records\nof psychical research. No such startling demonstration,\n1 See The Plienomena of Spiritualism, p. 111. This reprint of Crookes'\npapers and letters was published without his authority or revision.\nNo date and no reference is given to the paper from which the above\nis quoted. It was, I find, taken from a letter which Crookes sent to\nand was published in a weekly journal called The Spiritualist, long since\ndefunct. The Editor, Mr. W. H. Harrison, and Mrs. Ross Church\n(Florence Marryat) also contributed to that journal their reports of\nthe final scene with '\nKatie,' and from these reports it appears '\nKatie\n'\ncut oft locks of her hair and white robe and gave them to those\npresent, together with a note of adieu wliich she wrote in pencil adding\n\" Pensez. d moi. May 21, 1874.\" This gives the date of the sitting.\nFull particulars are given in Dr. Fournier d'Albe's book, New Light on\nImmortality, p. 256. In the Journal of the S.P.R.

The only\nparallel (we speak with reverence), is the appearance of our\nLord after His resurrection. If we accept that cardinal\nfact of the Christian religion, we have less difficulty in\naccepting Crookes' statements.\nIf, however, as the years pass, no similar phenomena\nrecur, even if no further evidence of the more remarkable\nphenomena that occurred with Home can be obtained,\nthen scepticism will be more legitimate and we should\nthen be disposed to reject what many of us now accept.\nCrookes, we must remember, was one of the most exact\nand accomplished experimental investigators the world has\nknown, he was not suffering during his spiritualistic\nexperiments from any mental failure, for he was con-\ncurrently conducting other scientific work of great value,\nwork that has never been impugned. The hallucination\ntheory Lord Rayleigh and Court Solovovo have discredited\n:\nthe latter well says, \" I lay it down as a general pro-\nposition . . . that the testimony of several sane, honest\nand intelligent eye-witnesses is, broadly speaking, proof of\nthe objectivity of any phenomenon. If there are people\nwho maintain an opposite view, why, let them make\nexperiments themselves.\" ^\nNor can it be said that Crookes changed liis views\nin later life and thought he had been deceived. As late\nas the year 1916 Sir W. Crookes authorized the editor of\nLight to publish the following :\n\" I adhere to my published statements and have nothing\nto retract . . . they point to the existence of another\norder of human life continuous with this, and demonstrate\nthe possibility under certain circumstances of communion\nbetween this world and the next.\" For my own part,\nhonoured as I have been for nearly fifty years with the\nfriendship of this eminent savant, and knowing as we\nall do Sir W.

No\nadvance in any branch of science would have been\npossible if the investigator set out not to elicit truth, but\nwith the determination to expose what he considered was\nfraud.

Mitchell, M.D.\nThe story of Doris Fischer has been told, in the Pro-\nceedings of the American Society for Psychical Research,'^\nby Dr. Walter F. Prince, an American clergyman, and\nDr. James Hyslop, the Secretary of that Society. It is\na story of dissociated personality, more full}' reported\nthan any hitherto recorded, and in some respects unique.\nDr. Prince's record occupies over thirteen hundred pages\nand is the outcome of more prolonged and more con-\ntinuous observation than is usually possible in such cases.\nHis unusual opportunities for observing the many pecu-\nliarities described by him arose from his having, at\nan early stage of his investigation, adopted Doris as his\ndaughter and brought her to live in his house. Dr.\nHyslop's share of the record consists of over eight hundred\npages in which he advocates a spiritistic interpretation\nof some of the phenomena of multiple personality, and\nclaims support for his views from a series of observa-\ntions and experiments conducted with his medium, Mrs.\nChenoweth, when Doris was the sitter.\nIn trying to get a grasp of the various personalities\nin this case, two courses are open to us ; we may either\nconsider the personalities in the historical order of their\nappearance, or we may consider them in the order of\ntheir discovery by Dr. Prince. The latter is, perhaps,\nthe course which will be most helpful to those who have\nno knowledge of the case. What can be said about the\n1 Proceedinys American Soc. for Psychical Research, Vols. IX. X. and XI.\n\fLxxix. The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 31\norder in which they arose in the hfe-history of Doris\nwill then be more easily understood.\nTowards the end of October, 1909, a somewhat forlorn\nand careworn-looking girl, twenty years of age, joined\nthe Sunday School of the Episcopal Church of which Dr.\nPrince was then rector. She was invited by Mrs. Prmce\nto the Pvectory and soon became a frequent visitor.\nThere Dr. Prince made her acquaintance. At first he\ndid not pay much attention to her but he thought there\nwas something odd about her. She seemed to be \" singu-\nlarly mercurial in temperament with moods that passed\nlike the cloud and sunshine.\" At times she was jolly\nand amusing. At other times she was sedate and\nmelancholv.\nT^Irs. Prince discovered that she slept Uttle at home\nand began to encourage her to come to the rectory in\nthe evening and he down. It was then discovered that\nshe talked in her sleep. At times she appeared to be\ndescribing visions of beauty, at times appeared to be\nsustaining her side of a dialogue, at still other times she\nuttered impatient or angry ejaculations or seemed to be\nthreatening herself. In this last mood she would look\npositively mahcious, clutch savagely at her hip, which\nwas supposed to be tuberculous, or make efforts to mal-\ntreat other parts of her body. Mrs. Prince was forced\nto watch her every movement and often to hold her\nhands or to put forth all her strength to restrain her\nfrom injuring herself. This went on for about eight\nmonths, and the nervous and physical strain entailed by\nher self-imposed task began to tell on Mrs. Prince's\nhealth. On account of this Dr. Prince suggested that the\ngirl might occasionally try to sleep on the lounge in his\nstudy where he could keep watch on her, and thus arose\nthe opportunities for the prolonged and continuous obser-\nvations which are contained in the \" Daily Record.\" Dr.\nPrince began his observations on January 17th, 1911,\nand next day started the records which he continued\ndaily, with almost no exceptions, for more than three\nyears. On January 20th, it suddenly dawned on him,\naccompanied by wonder that it had not done so before,\n\f32 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nthat here was probably a case of dissociated personaUty.\nHe proceeded to test his hypothesis and was very soon\nconvinced that it was correct.\nUnderneath the Doris that he knew, who afterwards\ncame to be known as Sick Doris, he discovered a person-\nality, child-hke and winsome, to whom the name Margaret\nwas given. This doubling of the personality was the\nexplanation of some of the oddities that had struck him\nwhen he first ioiew the girl. When she had appeared\nforlorn and careworn Sick Doris had been \" out \"\u2014as\nbeing supraliminal came to be called. When she had\nbeen }o\\\\y and amusing Margaret had been \" out \" and\nSick Doris had been \"in.\"\nAlthough Margaret was on the whole a very lovable\npersonality she was at times mischievous and malicious.\nIf Sick Doris did anything of which Margaret disapproved,\nMargaret would take her revenge at night during sleep\nby clutching at the hip and otherwise maltreating the body.\nThis habit of hers was the original cause of the need\nfor watching and restraint during sleep. In the evening\nof January 22nd, Sick Doris came to the rectory looking\nvery jaded and miserable and was evidently suffering.\nPresently she lay down and went to sleep. Margaret\ncame and clutched savagely at the hip and scratched\nthe neck. Dr. Prince remonstrated in vain. Stern\ncommands to desist had no effect but to increase the\nmanifestations. The scene that followed is so important\nfor the understanding of the case, and so dramatic in\ncharacter, that I give it in Dr. Prince's own words\n:\n\" Attempting suggestion I began to say impressively,\n(' I am going to take away your power. You are growing\nweaker. You are losing your strength '). The struggles\nbecame weaker. Finally I said (' Your strength is gone.\nYou are powerless '). All striving ceased, the face changed,\nand she [S. D.l awoke. She now appeared extremely\nlanguid and spoke with difficulty, but said that she felt\nno pain. Her vital forces seemed to be ebbing away\nand she gradually passed into a condition which made\nMrs. Prince and me think, not for the first time, that she\nwas dying. Her pulse descended to 54, and became feeble.\n\fIjXXIX.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 33\nShe seemed only half conscious, but occasionally looked\nwonderingly at the two who were sitting by her, affected\nby their impression that she was near her end. At length\nshe murmured: 'Am I dying ^ (I think so.) Don't you\nwant me to go ?\n'\nShe smiled peacefully, as though glad\nboth to go and to know that she was to be missed.\nShe looked singularly unhke her afternoon self, the very\nshape of her face altered\u2014it seemed thinner, as though\nshe had passed through a period of sickness since. Under\nthe spell of considerable emotion I was looldng into her\neyes, and presently her gaze fixed upon mine, and with\nparted hps she continued to look, not rigidly, but dreamily\nand peacefully, while we waited for the end which we\nthought so near. After some time it suddenly struck\nme that her gaze and features were unnaturally fixed\n\u2014\nI stooped to examine her.\nJust then a voice issued from her lips, though no other\nfeature moved :\n'\nYou must get her out of this. She is\nin danger.' It was as startHng as Mghtning from the\nblue sky. Of course I thought it must be Margaret\nspeaking, but there was a calm authority in her tone\nwhich was new. I shook the girl gently, her face did\nnot change. '\nShake her harder,' the voice went on.\n'\nHurry ! Hurry !\n'\nIt was evident that Doris was in\na profoxmd state of hypnosis, and I began vigorous\nmeasures to bring her out, with the result that her eyes\nrolled and her limbs moved. Shaking her and shouting\nin her ear brought her to a sitting position. '\nWalk her !\nwalk her !\n'\nsaid the voice, At first there was difficulty\nin carrying out this order, she stumbled and tended every\nmoment to collapse upon the carpet. Directions occasion-\nally continued to issue from the lips . . . directions which\nI never thought of disregarding, they were delivered with\nsuch authority and characterised by such good sense.\nFinally we heard, '\nShe is coming to herself now ; she\nwill be aU right soon.' No more directions were given,\nand almost at once the face showed more animation and\nintelligence.\"\nI do not know what impression the account of this\nsingular episode may produce on the mind of a non-\n\f34 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nmedical reader, but I know what they may suggest to\nanyone who has had some experience of hysteric and\nhypnotic phenomena. Dr. Prince's suggestions, \" I am\ngoing to take away your strength. You are growing\nweaker. You are losing your strength. Your strength\nis gone. You are powerless,\" were more potent than he\nhad anticipated. Not only did they cause a cessation\nof Margaret's savage movements, but they produced, as\nsuggestions of this sort may, a depressing effect on the\nwhole physical organism. Such suggestions given to a\nperson already in enfeebled health may bring about a\nstate that appears very alarming and may easily lead one\nwho is unfamihar with such phenomena to lose his head.\nDr. Prince's final suggestion, conveyed in his reply, \" I\nthink so,\" given to the question, \" Am I dying,\" was\nthe cUmax. Something was bound to happen and the\npatient's only way of appearing to carry out the suggestion\nshort of actually djdng, was to go into a deeper stage\nof hypnosis. This was faciUtated by the fixed emotional\ngaze which the situation had chanced to bring about.\nThe voice that came Uke a bolt from the blue was an\ninteresting and no doubt startling phenomenon. But\nthere is no reason to suppose that the voice had any\nother source than some deeper stratum of her own being.\nThis deeper and more sane personaHty, recognizing that\nDr. Prince had lost his bearings, feels the need to take\ncontrol herself, and she issues commands which he duti-\nfully obeys. The voice was the voice of Sleeping Margaret,\nand from this moment she dominates the scene, she\ndoininates Dr. Prince, and she does so to the end of the\nwhole story.\nThe futility of Sleeping Margaret's instructions as to the\nbest way to get a person out of deep hypnosis gives a\ngood clue to her natvu-e and origin. Her wisdom was\nthe wisdom of popular belief and practice. No one who\nhad any true knowledge of hypnotic phenomena would\nhave given such instructions, and no one having any\npractical experience would have acted upon them. They\nserved their purpose, it is true ; but they would probably\nhave been equally efficacious if they had taken some\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 35\nother form. Their efficacy depended on the fact that they\nwere a suggestion from within \u2014-a counter suggestion to\nthe death sentence pronounced by Dr. Prince, a counter\nsuggestion made strong by the mil to live inherent in her\nbeing.\nDr. Prince had now discovered three personaUties in\nhis patient, namely, Sick Doris, Margaret, and Sleeping\nMargaret. About a month after the discovery of the\nlast named, what he calls the central secret of the cai:e\nwas disclosed to him by Margaret. \" You never saw\nthe Real Doris but a very little\u2014when it was all Doris,\"\nshe said impressively, and went to sleep, adding, \" I will\nwake Doris so that she will be all Doris for a little\nwhile.\" And she did so. Dr. Prince adds, though he\ndid not fully comprehend that the clear-eyed girl looking\nwonderingly about her was the primary personality, and, as\nsuch, quite another than Sick Doris.\nStill another personality in the case is described by\nDr. Prince on grounds that perhaps may be regarded as\ninadequate. From the beginning of his watching Doris\nasleep he had at times observed certain somnambuhstic\nphenomena which came to be known as conversation-\nrecitals. Only one side of the dialogue\u2014her own\u2014was recited,\nthe other being represented by pauses. Late in his\nobservation of the case he was led to beMeve that these\nrecitals were produced, by an inchoate but valid person-\naUty distinct from the others, and to this personahty the\nname of Sleeping Real Doris was given.\nSuch are the five personahties of this case in the order\nin which they were discovered by Dr. Prince. His first\nacquaintance was with Sick Doris, whom for a long time\nhe took to be the primary personality. Then he found\nMargaret and Sleeping Margaret. Then Margaret dis-\nclosed to him the existence of a Real Doris, different\nfrom the Sick Doris. Finally he beheved there was\nstill another personahty\u2014Sleeping Real Doris, and this\nbelief was confirmed by Margaret and Sleeping Margaret.\nWhen we come to consider these different personalities\nin the historical oider of their appearance instead of in\nthe order in which they were discovered by Dr. Prince,\n\fI\n36 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part j\ni\nwe find that almost all our information is derived from\none or more of the personalities themselves. But so\nconsistently, on the whole, do their separate accounts ;\nfit in Avith each other, that we are justified in believing i\nthat the history of their origin thus obtained is in some \\\nsense true. Yet the story they tell is unique in the \\\nrecords of multiple personality and there is much in it [\non which at present it would be hazardous to venture <\nto give any decided opinion. Very briefly, this story |\nis as follows.\nDoris Fischer was born in 1889. She was the youngest j\nchild of German parents who Uved in poor circumstances |\nin a large American city. Her father was a drunkard, j\nand one day, after a quarrel with his wife, he took up \\\nDoris, then three years old, and dashed her on to the '\\\nfloor. The shock to Doris, caused by this quarrel and 1\nact of violence, is supposed to have started the series of |\ndissociations which gave rise to the different personalities\nalready enumerated.\nSleeping Margaret, so called because she manifested only i\nwhen Margaret was asleep, is the chiel: source of our\nknowledge of the lives of all the personalities before the 1\ncase came under Dr. Prince's care. She claimed that she ]\nherself was the first to appear. She came during the 1\nquarrel between the parents, just before Doris was thrown j\non the floor. She came as a mature personality although\nDoris was only three years old at the time. But there was ;\nno outward manifestation of her presence for nineteen years\nand her existence was totally unknown and unsuspected\nuntil Dr. Prince discovered her on January 22nd, 1911. \\\nMentally, Dr. Prince says, she was the maturest of j\nthem all, and impressed him as if she were a woman j\nof forty. In another place, however, he says she \" is at i\nleast as mature as R. D. is, and the range of her know- i\nledge is greater.\" Whatever the degree of her maturity \\\nmay have been, she claimed that she had been the same |\nfrom the beginning. She professed never to sleep, but\nshe was never \" out \" as an alternating personality, \\\nhaving control of the whole body, as Sick Doris and\nMargaret had when they were out. She never took ^\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 37\ncontrol of the body to any great extent except as regards\nthe vocal organs, and then only when Margaret was\nasleep, or at a later stage, when Real Doris was asleep.\nShe claimed to persist as a continuous, co-consciousness\nand to know all the thoughts, and feeHngs, and actions\nof all the other personahties (except S. R. D.). She\nsaid she saw M.'s thoughts directly, those of S. D.\nthrough, or reflected from, the consciousness of M., and\nthose of R. D. as reflected from the consciousness of\nS. D. to M. and again from that of M. to herself. Dr.\nPrince says she was the only one of the group who was\nnot suggestible.\nThe advent of Margaret was stated to have taken place\na few minutes after Doris had been dashed on the floor.\nWith trifling discrepancies, Margaret and Sleeping Margaret\ngave the same accoimt of this occurrence. Here is\nMargaret's own original description of it :\n\" When Doris\nwas three years old I came one night when she was lying\non the bed crying as if her little heart would break\nbecause her father had thrown her on the floor, well,\nI made her play with her fingers and toes and finally\nhad her laughing and then she went to sleep.\" This\ndescription impHes, I think, that Margaret first came as\na co-consciousness and not as an alternating personality,\nand I have been unable to trace the record, if such\nexists, of Margaret's first coming \" out.\"\nMargaret was in many respects the \" Sally \" of the\nDoris case. She grew until she attained the age and\ncapacities of a child of ten, and remained at that stage\nuntil, in the course of Dr. Prince's treatment of the\ncase, she began to decline. Finally she disappeared alto-\ngether. '\nShe was mentally and emotionally a child of not\nmore than ten years, with some extraordinarily naive\nnotions not usually carried beyond the age of five or six.\nHer facial expression was strikingly child-Hke, her\nvoice in speech or laughter that of a young tom-boy,\nher point of view, mental habits, and tastes, in every\nway juvenile. . . . She was mischievous, roguish, witty,\na consummate mimic, ingratiating, winsome and altogether\nlovable, as a rule.\" Margaret was co-conscious with S. D.\n\f38 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nand R. D., and knew their thoughts, their feelings and\ntheir actions, but she knew nothing of S. M. She\nclaimed that her knowledge of S. D. was immediate while\nof R. D. it was mediate, reflected as it were from S. D.'s\nconsciousness as from a mirror. Dr. Prince considered\nher the most suggestible of all the personahties.\nFrom the age of three to the age of seventeen these\nthree personalities existed side by side. Doris [R. D.]\nand Margaret alternated one with the other, while\nSleeping Margaret remained in the sub-conscious as a\nsilent watcher and guardian of Doris's welfare.\nOn May 6th, 1906, when Doris was seventeen years old,\nher mother, whom she adored, died after a few hours'\nillness. Although overcome with grief, Doris \" managed\nto retain her individuaUty until she had performed the\nlast offices in her power for her dead idol, whereupon\nMargaret took her place. Almost immediately thereafter\na terrible pain shot through the left cerebral hemisphere,\nM. vanished, and a new personahty, afterwards to be\nknown as Sick Doris, came into the drama.\"\nSick Doris, on her first appearance, and for some days\nthereafter, was an infantile personahty, at least as regards\nthe content of her mind. She had no memory of anything\nthat Doris or Margaret had ever learnt. She Ivnew no\none, she could not speak, nor could she understand Avords\nspoken to her. She could walk and handled objects with\nher fingers, but she hardly Imew how to eat or drink.\n\" All affection was gone and all grief ; not a tremor\nremained of the mental agony of a few moments before.\nShe was as one born with an adult body . . . but with\nabsolutely no memory and absolutely no knowledge.\"\nBut she had a \" maturely inquiring mind \" and she very\nsoon learned many things. Her progress was rapid after\nthe third evening, when Margaret undertook her tuition.\nIn a week Sick Doris was fairly competent to get along\nthough she had many difficulties yet to meet.\nThe Real Doris of the record is in many respects the\nmost elusive and most unsatisfactory of ail the person-\nalities described. In the early days of Dr. Prince's\nobservation of the case, Real Doris very seldom appeared.\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 39\nand when she did so, her time \" out \" was so short that\nthere could have been Uttle to record concerning her\nsayings and doings. When at a later date she was \" out\n\"\nmore frequently and for longer periods, Dr. Prince\napparently did not consider it necessary to reveal her\ncharacter and disposition as fully as he had revealed\nthose of the other personalities. His own afJection and\nesteem for her has blinded him to the fact that the\nReal Doris of his record entirely fails to win either the\ninterest or the liking of his readers in the way that\nMargaret, for example, does.\nThe only detailed account of Real Doris's mental and\nmoral characteristics is given in the opening pages of the\nmain narrative. But it is expressly stated that \" this is\na sketch of the normal personality functioning unhindered\nby the other personalities, as is the case continually now\nthat she is cured.\" Throughout the whole record the\nReal Doris that appears as an alternating personality, at\nfirst fitfully and for short periods, later more frequently\nand continuously, is explicitly regarded as the primary\npersonality and implicitly as a normal personahty. Yet\nthere is plenty of evidence to show that the alternating\nReal Doris of the record is a hysteric personality with\nmany hysterical stigmata.\nThe fifth and last personahty in the case appeared\nabout a year and a half after the advent of Sick Doris.\nMargaret was startled when going up a flight of steps\nand fell, striking her head violently against an earthen\ncrock. As a result of this fall, Margaret said, \" a little\ncrack was made in Real Doris,\" which led to the somnam-\nbulistic conversation-recitals ascribed by Dr. Prince to\nSleeping Real Doris. The \" crack,\" however, would seem\nto have affected Sick Doris also, for some of Sick Doris's\nmemories appeared in the recitals as well as those of real\nDoris. This personality may be disregarded in our\nfurther consideration of the case.\nThe problems raised by the Doris Fischer case of\nmultiple personahty are so many and so diverse that it\nis well to have some common ground from which we may\nview them. Such ground may be found in the interest\n\f40 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nwe all have in Psychical Research. But although we all\nhave in common some interest in the subject matter of\nPsychical Research, it is not to be supposed that we\nare all at the same stage of inquiry. Some have already\nreached conviction in regard to the ultimate object of\nour quest. Others are still seeking for proof of the\noccurrence of any supernormal happenings whatsoever.\nBoth groups, however, should find some interest in the\nDoris case. It would, indeed, seem to provide a good\nstandpoint from which to view the whole field of Psychical\nResearch. From it we may look backwards over the\nwide field of abnormal psychology, into whose mazes\nMr. Myers so patiently led us in the early days of our\nSociety's work ; or we may look forward to the still\nuncharted country whose survej^ will form the chief work\nof this Society for many years to come.\nWhatever bearing the Doris case may ultimately be\nfound to have on the higher problems of Psychical\nResearch, we must be content, for the present, to employ\nthe elementary principles of method which are necessary\nin every scientific investigation. We must try to arrange\nour data in some sort of order. The facts must be\nclassified and their correlations with other facts discovered.\nIn doing so we may perhaps be able to reduce the observed\nfacts to more generalized terms, and this is perhaps as\nfar as we can usefuUy go at present. We may, indeed,\nindulge in tentative hypotheses, but until we have a\nmuch larger number of trustworthy observations than we\nat present possess, it is unhkely that our formulations\nregarding the problems of multiple personahty will have\nmuch value.\nBesides the obvious ground of comparison with other\nrecorded cases, there are at least two directions in which\nwe may usefully look when we try to find something with\nwhich to compare the facts observed by Dr. Prince. In\none direction we find many similarities or analogies\nbetween Doris phenomena and the phenomena of Hysteria\nand Hypnosis. In the other direction we find interesting\ngrounds for comparison of the Doris personalities with\nthe so-called controls of mediumistic trance.\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 41\nThe relations of the Doris case with Hysteria may seem\ntoo obvious to be mentioned. From one point of view\nit is just a case of hysteria, and its symptoms show, not\nresemblance to, but identity with those of other hysterical\nconditions. On the other hand, it presents so many\nunusual features, that it may be well to understand what\nwe mean by hysteria, before we class all its peculiarities\nunder this term.\nAnaesthesia was regarded by Charcot as the great\nstigma of hysteria, and although it is not now beheved\nto have the diagnostic importance formerly ascribed to\nit, we may still look upon it as one of the most common\nfeatm'es of the disorder and the one best suited for study\nas a type of hysterical disabihty. Janet showed that in\nthe anaesthesia of hysteria sensation is not wholly sup-\npressed as it is when anaesthesia is due to organic disease.\nAlthough the patient has no supraUminal perception of\nimpressions, such as pinpricks, it can be shown by various\ndevices, that perception is still present in some sub-\nhminal form. We have in these experiments the simplest\nillustration of that division or dissociation of consciousness\nwhich reaches such remarkable proportions in cases of\nmultiple personahty.\nJanet apphed the principle of dissociation of conscious-\nness throughout the whole range of hysterical disabilities,\nand it became common to regard hysteria and dissociation\nas synonymous terms. Every hysterical symptom was\ndue to dissociation of consciousness, and every dissociation\nof consciousness was evidence of hysteria.\nThe doctrine of dissociation has been accepted, in a\ngeneral way, by all competent authorities ; but there is\nno unanimity of opinion in regard to the way in which\ndissociation is brought about. Janet looks upon dis-\nsociation as a merely mechanical splitting of consciousness,\na letting go of certain functions because the personahty\nis too feeble to hold on to them. Freud puts in the\nfirst hne, as a determining factor of dissociation, the\nmental conflict that ensues when incompatible wishes or\ndesires arise in the mind. The sphtting of consciousness\nis explained dynamically as being due to a conflict of\n\f42 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nopposing forces within the personality. From the merely\ndescriptive standpoint Janet's work has been the more\nimportant, but from the standpoint of interpretation that\nof Freiid has been far more fruitful. Outside the work\nof the psychoanalysts we have no real understanding of\nhysterical phenomena, and if dissociated personality be\nregarded as hysteria its true mechanism may be explicable\nonly when it is submitted to psychoanalytic interpretation.\nHitherto psychoanalysts, so far as I know, have not\ndealt explicitly with the phenomena of multiple personaKty ;\nbut that these cases can be interpreted on psychoanalytic\nlines I have no doubt. Many of the data necessary\nfor such an interpretation, in so far as these can be\nprovided by documentary evidence, are to be found in\nthe Doris Fischer record. But even if such an inter-\npretation should be given, there would still be left many\nimportant problems,\u2014subsidiary problems, perhaps, from\nthe analyst's point of view, but important problems from\nother points of view, such as those of Psychical Research.\nThere is, for example, one matter on which the des-\ncriptive work of Janet is more helpful in the consideration\nof these cases than is the interpretive work of Freud.\nJanet appeared to demonstrate the existence of conscious\nsubliminal activity in his hysterics, and there is no more\nstriking feature of the Doris case than the mass of\nevidence which points to the reality of the co -consciousness\nwhich the various personalities claim. Freud on the other\nhand denies that co-consciousness ever occurs. In a\ncommunication which he contributed to our Proceedings\nin 1912, he said : \"I venture to urge against this theory\nthat it is a gratuitous assumption based on the abuse\nof the word '\nconscious '\n. . . The cases described as\nsphtting of consciousness, like Dr. Azam's, might better\nbe denoted as shifting of consciousness,\u2014that function\n\u2014\nor whatever it be\u2014oscillating between two difierent\npsychical complexes which become conscious and un-\nconscious in alternation.\" But this explanation is not\napplicable to such a case as that of Doris Fischer, for here\nwe seem to have good evidence of two or more psychical\ncomplexes being simultaneously conscious.\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 43\nThus for the present it may be more helpful to regard\nthe hysterical features of the Doris case from the stand-\npoint of dissociation as described by Janet, whilst bearing\nin mind that such a view may not be fundamentally\ninconsistent with the interpretive methods of the psycho-\nanalysts. Moreover, we may hold that the conclusions\narrived at by the use of these methods are, for certain\npurposes, irrelevant, and, in regard to certain special\nproblems, inadequate.\nBut if we are to regard all hysterical symptoms as\nbeing the outcome of dissociation, we must guard against\nJanet's implication that every dissociation is evidence of\nhysteria. We must distinguish between dissociations\nthat are hurtful and those that are indifferent or helpful.\nIt would be well to restrict the use of the word hysterical\nto those dissociations which result in defects or dis-\nabilities. For only in so far as dissociation causes some\nmal-adjustment to environment can it be looked upon\nas a disease. We should be prepared to find dissociations\nthat lead, not to defects, but to enhancements of the\nnatural powers ; and before concluding that such dis-\nsociations must tend to mal-adjustment, it might be well\nto ask if we know all that is to be known of the environ-\nment to which man has to adjust himself.\nIn man the evolutionai'y process would seem to be\nno longer restricted to the struggle for purely biological\nexistence. In the course of cultural development, in the\ngrowth, of the moral character, conflicts within the mind\ntake the place of the conflicts with foes or circumstances\nwhich determine biological or economic survival, and the\ninternal conflict may be so intense that the unity of\nconsciousness is sundered. Such conflicts are in some\ndegree common to all mankind, and if sometimes they\nlead to dissociation and sometimes they do not, we must\nsuppose that the different results must be due either to\ndifferences in the intensity of the conflict or to differences\nin the inherent liability to dissociation ; or both of these\nfactors may be present and, indeed, both may be dependent\nupon some common underlying peculiarity of psycho-\nneural organization. The intensity of the conflict may be\n\f44 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nthe outcome of a moral or aesthetic hypersensitiveness\nwhich meets with rude shocks in the actual experiences of\nlife, or from thoughts that arise in the mind in relation\nto desires whose true meaning and significance are ex-\nplicable only by reference to more primitive forms or\nconditions of life. The inherent liability to dissociation\nmust be correlated with some psycho-neural peculiarity\nwhich makes dissociation possible.\nThe capacity for dissociation may be supposed to\ndepend on a plasticity of psycho-neural dispositions which\npermits departure from habitual modes of reaction. In\nthe earlier stages of evolution this plasticity is exploited\nsolely in the interests of biological survival and is slight\nin amount ; for so long as the physical struggle for\nexistence is stiU the dominating factor in evolution, these\nreactions must become stereotyped along biologically useful\nlines, and only so much plasticity as is necessary for\nadaptation to common environmental changes is desirable.\nAlong the lines of growth and integration psycho-neural\norganization leads to functional and structural rigidity,\nbut some degree of plasticity must always be retained at\nthe gi'owing point.\nSo long as chai'acter is in process of formation there\nis always a growing point in the structure of the mind.\nIt is at the growing point that plasticity will be found,\nand the possibility of the occurrence of dissociation may\nindicate the high-water mark of mental evolution. We\nspeak with respect of persons whose nervous systems are\nsaid to be stable ; but stable nervous systems are like\nfossils in the evolutionary process. They record the\nattainments of the past, but show nothing of the promise\nof the future. But where plasticity and instability are\nfound, dissociations may occur. Some of these may have\nsurvival value in the present ; some may have survival\nvalue in the future ; while some will be inimical to the\nwell-being of the individual or the race.\nWith the safeguards to life and limb afforded to the\nindividual in civilized communities it is no longer necessary\nto have all the faculties continuously alert to every\nenvironmental change.

The\nstudent or inventor who becomes so absorbed in the\nobject of his pursuit that he loses touch with his sm'-\nroundings and is oblivious of time and place, may be\nsaid to have consciousness dissociated ; but he is not\ntherefore to be classed as a hysteric. The poet in his\nmoments oi inspiration, the genius of any kind in the\nfull exercise of his powers, is reacting in an unusual way\nto ordinary stimuli, and his doing so is in part dependent\non the psycho-neural plasticity which permits it.\nI have said that the occurrence of dissociation is\nthe outcome of a departure from habitual modes of reaction,\nand that we have no right to conclude that dissociation\nis always or entirely disadvantageous. It may, indeed,\nbe argued that in some cases and in some ways, it may\nbe beneficial. Dr. Schiller says, in his review of the\nDoris Fischer record :\n\" So-caUed '\ndissociations '\nare not\nmechanical processes, even when they are excited by\nbodily injuries, nor are they whoUy morbid. What stands\nout very clearly in Doris Fischer's case is that they are\nreally teleological\u2014protective reactions to alleviate the\nburden of living.\" ^ This is in substance the teaching\nof psychoanalysts. The neurosis is a flight into sickness\nin order to escape from a reality that is unbearable.\nIts teleological character, however, is restricted to the\navoidance of mental pain, and it is doubtful if any\npsychoanalyst would admit that a split-off secondary\npersonality is ever an improvement on the normal '\nwhole\n'\nself. The most he would admit is that a secondary\npersonaUty may contain much that is estimable which\nought to belong to the normal self. Thus he would say\nthat the Real Doris would have been much improved by\nthe incorporation in her character of those traits which\nmade Margaret so lovable\u2014traits which really belong to\nDoris and have been unnecessarily repressed.\nThe protective nature of dissociation, in the sense\n^Proceedings S. P. R., Vol. XXIX., p. .395.\n\f46 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nthat it is a defence reaction against unbearable ideas, is\nadmitted by iDsychoanalysts just so far as they consider dis- 1\nsociation to be a consequence of repression, but some\nambiguity may be found to arise from assuming that ;\ndissociation of consciousness can always be directly cor-\nrelated with repression. The occurrence of a splitting of\nconsciousness in hysteria is admitted by both Janet and\nFreud, but on Janet's hypothesis the splitting is due to\nan inability of the self to assimilate certain ideas and\nfeelings which ought to belong to it. On Freud's hypo-\nthesis the dissociation is due, not to an inability but to\nan unwilHngness of the personality to accept or acknow-\nledge certain experiences as its own. Yet it must be\nobserved that besides this difference in these two explana-\ntions of the origin of dissociation, there is, or may be, a\nfurther difference in respect of the mental material on which ,\nthe dissociation is supposed to bear. In a '\nhysterical\n'\nparalysis of the arm, on Janet's hypothesis, the ideas i\nand feelings related to the use of the arm have become\n'\ndissociated from the personal consciousness. But accord-\ning to Freud dissociation in such a case bears primarily |\non a totally different system of ideas. It bears on some |\nwish-formation which, after being dissociated by repression, \\\nbecomes ' converted '\ninto this particular physical disa- :\nbility. But the motor disability is itself a dissociation, i\nas Janet has shown, and it is not a dissociation directly\ndue to repression. It seems to depend on some con-\nstitutional peculiarity\u2014an '\nadaptation for conversion '\n\u2014\nthat is not always present.\n'\nWhen a conscious wish is repressed it may be said i\nthat a dissociation occurs in so far as something that was\nin consciousness has become split off from it ; but when i\nthe repressed wish tries to become conscious again and |\nsucceeds only by becoming converted into a paralysis or 1\nan anaesthesia, a further dissociation would seem to\noccur ;\nfor here again something that was in conscious- !\nness becomes split off from it. As a dissociation of I\nconsciousness the repression of a wish may be almost\nnegligible, but when the repressed wish becomes con-\nverted into bodily paralysis or anaesthesia there is no\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 47\nmistaking the gap in the field of consciousness which\noccurs. On the other hand repression may involve so\ngreat a section of consciousness that the presence of\ndissociation may be made manifest by the amnesia which\nit entails ; and the repressed material may at intervals\nforce itself to the surface and dominate the organism in\nsomnambulistic attacks or as an alternating secondary\npersonality.\nEven if it cannot be maintained that dissociation is\never a wholly beneficial process, it is noteworthy that\neven in admittedly hysterical dissociation we sometimes\nfind evidence of increased capacity in some directions\ncombined with disabilities in other directions : but it is\nthe disabilities and not the unusual abilities that justify\nthe diagnosis of hysteria. And we may get dissociations\nin which the disabilities are negligible and the enhanced\npowers or the unusual modes of functioning are the only\nnoticeable features.\nIn illustration of this, reference may be made to the\nconsiderable number of persons who have the power of\nproducing automatic writing. Such \" automatic \" activities\nmust be regarded as the work of dissociated states of\nconsciousness. We cannot look upon them as true auto-\nmatisms ; such a view seems quite untenable. Nor\ncan we regard them as being evidence of hysteria, for\nthe persons who can produce automatic script are often\nfar from being hysterical in any useful sense of the word.\nThere is, moreover, a considerable body of evidence\nin support of the belief that dissociated activities of this\nkind are sometimes accompanied by the manifestation of\nsupernormal powers, such as telepathy or those medium-\nistic phenomena which are thought by some people to\nafford proof of spirit communication.\nIf we accept the possibility of telepathy, and if we\nfind that telepathy is observed in connexion with dis-\nsociated states more frequently than with states in which\nno dissociation is suspected, we must conclude that we\nhave here an instance of dissociation leading to enhance-\nment of the natural powers. Whether such manifestations\nof supernormal powers are necessarily accompanied by\n\f48 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [PAET\ndefects in other directions must be determined empirically ;\nwe are not entitled to conclude on theoretical grounds\nthat it must be so. And we know that in individual\ninstances of automatic writers or trance mediums, it is\noften extremely difficult to justify any such conclusion.\nThey may seem to be as well adapted to life as their\nfellows.\nHere, moreover, comes in the question of our know-\nledge of the environment to which man has to adjust\nhimself. If there is a transcendental world and if these\ndissociated states are a means of getting into relation\nwith it, we shovdd perhaps regard these individuals, in\nthis respect at least, as being more fully adjusted to their\nenvironment than ordinary men and women are.\nWhen we consider the later stages in the evolution of\nhuman personality we may see that man's environment\nextends beyond his physical and social surroundings.\nHis intellectual aspirations are not limited by utility, his\nemotional needs are not satisfied by intercourse with his\nfellows, his moral nature transcends the obligations of\ncivic duty and social service. The struggle for existence\nis no longer confined to the interaction between the self\nwithin and the not-self without but is transferred to\nthe veiy centre of the self as a struggle between the\nelements which enter into its construction. The relative\ndissociation of concentrated thought may be a biological\ngain, the repression of a wish that is incompatible with\nthe moral nature may be a victory for the struggling\npersonality, but the paralysis of a limb, although it may\nbe a successful means of defending the personality against\nan unbearable idea, is biologically a failure. Personality\nmay develop at the expense of the bodily organism, but\nbiologically it must not. For although the struggle of\nconative trends within the self may be necessary for the\nevolution of the moral consciousness, the older struggle for\nexistence of the whole organism can never be abrogated.\nHysterical symptoms may be regarded as the outcome of\ndissociative processes that take place at the growing point\nin the development of personality and are biologically\nfailures.

My eyes fall\nimmediately on the foUomng passage : \"at about 2 p.m.\nI suggested to M. that she close her eyes and sleep.\nShe laughed and looked at me with an expression which\nshowed that she kncAv what I was after. She did not\nseem inclined to close her eyes so I began to say, '\nYou\nare sleepy. Your eyelids are heavy,' etc., and the hds\ndropped and in a minute she was asleep.\"\nOr take the following incident : \"I took R. D. to a\ndentist to have some teeth fiUed. ... As soon as she\nwas in the chair I took her hand and dii'ected her to\nclose her eyes, but this she seemed unable to do. The\nmoment the work began she went to sleep. . . . She\ncontinued unconscious and motionless until two teeth had\nbeen filled, then M. awoke. I put her to sleep by the\nsuggestion process, and a thu'd cavity was bored.\" ^\nIn the light of such incidents and many others of a\nsimilar land, I confess I do not know what Dr. Prince\nmeans when he says that he did not employ hypnotism\nin his treatment. For he was on these occasions employ-\ning the most usual method of inducing hypnosis, and was\nas truly a hypnotist as was Liebeault or Bernheim when\nthey introduced this method more than thirty years ago.\n^ Cf. the cases of self-induced anaesthesia, while undergoing dental treat-\nment, of Mrs. Thompson and Mrs. Verrall, both automatic writers\n(Proc, S.P.R., Vol. XVIII., pp. 107-111).\nD\n\f50 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nBut the knowledge that Dr. Prince actually used hypnotic\nmethods is hardly necessary. The hypnotic character of\nmany of the phenomena stares us in the face on almost\nevery page of the record. And if we fail to realize that\nbetween Dr. Prince and his adopted daughter there was\nat all times the same rapport as exists between the\nhypnotist and his patient, much that is famihar or\ncommonplace may seem obscure and mysterious.\nIt is not only those incidents that may have been due\nto suggestion, conscious^ or unconsciously given by\nDr. Prince, that reveal the hypnotic character of many\nof the Doris phenomena. Every suggestion from without\nbefore it is efficacious, has to be \" accepted,\" and thus\nbecomes really a suggestion from within. This is probably\ntrue of all hjrpnotic suggestion. It is demonstrably true\nof suggestion in trained hypnotic subjects. For in trained\nhypnotic subjects we have a sort of new integration of\nconsciousness at the hypnotic level, which is practically\nan incipient secondary personahty,\u2014a personahty, capable\nof independent judgment, on whose goodwill the success\nof all suggestion from without depends.\nIf a person be deeply hypnotized at the first attempt\nand a suggestion be made that he will perform some\nsimple action at a specified time after awaking from\nhypnosis, the action will be duly carried out although\nthere is no conscious recollection of the suggestion, and\nits performance will be characterized by all the peculiarities\nof suggested post-hypnotic acts. Such suggestions are\nusually given in the form of commands, and the popular\nnotion of hypnotic compulsion is mainly derived from the\nwitnessing of such experiments. If, however, this same\nperson be frequently hypnotized, and if during hypnosis\nhe be talked to, and encouraged to talk, as if he were\nin the ordinary waking state, it may then be said that\nwe are dealing with a hy|Dnotic personahty rather than\nwith a hypnotized person. Such a personality may show\nno difference from the waking personality except as\nregards memory. In the waking state all the events of\nthe hypnotic state are forgotten, while in the hypnotic\nstate all the events of the waking state are remembered..\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 51\nIf now a suggestion, to be fulfilled after hypnosis, be\ngiven, it is not necessary to assume any tone of com-\nmand. It may be put in the form of a request, and,\nif it is assented to, its fulfilment will be indistinguishable\nfrom an ordinary post-h5rpnotic act : or the choice of the\nact to be performed may be left to the hjrpnotic person-\nality, and the hypnotist may be left in ignorance of the\naction determined upon. Yet here again its fulfilment,\nafter hjrpnosis, is indistinguishable from an ordinary post-\nhypnotic act, and the subject himself, in the waking state,\nmay regard it as having its origin in a suggestion from\nthe hypnotist.\nIt may thus be seen that any idea or intention arising\nin the hypnotic stratum of consciousness, vv^hether spon-\ntaneously or by suggestion from without, may work itself\nout in the waking state in ways indistinguishable from\nthose that are characteristic of post-hypnotic suggestions.\nThe personahty formed at the hypnotic level has, there-\nfore, what we may call suggestive power over the\npersonahty at the higher level ; and I would assert that\nwhen there are several personalities in co-conscious series,\nwhether they are artificial products or have arisen\nspontaneously, this same relation subsists between them\nall. Any idea arising in or entering into the mind of\na co-conscious personahty may have suggestive power over\nthe personalities above it in the series,\u2014that is to say,\npersonahties to whom it stands in the hypnotic relation\nof linowing but being unknown by them.\nThe importance 'of this conception in its apphcation to\nthe Doris personahties is most apparent when we consider\nthe part played by Sleeping Margaret in the therapeutic\nmanagement of the case. Dr. Prince says :\n\" She was\nmy chief coadjutor in the case, though Margaret was\nalso generally anxious to help, studied the progress of\nR. D. and gave valuable information. But Sleeping\nMargaret studied the interior situation unremittingly,\nwatched the result of my experiments and reported there-\non, suggested measures which often proved of great\nimportance, and made predictions as to the development\nof the case which were nearly, not quite, always justified\n\f52 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nby the event.\" Dr. Prince says Sleeping Margaret was j\nhis chief coadjutor. I am incHned to think she was his\nj\ncommander-in-chief, while he was her hard-working chief-\nj\nof -staff.\nSuccessful prediction of the course of the illness is a\ncommon feature in hysteria when the dissociation is at\nall profound, and especially when anything of the nature\nof a secondary personahty has developed. The usual\nexplanation of this\u2014and, so far as it goes, no doubt the\ntrue explanation\u2014is that the prediction is a self-suggestion,\na suggestion from within, whose fulfilment brings its own\nverification. And I would maintain that the predictions\nof Sleeping Margaret, and the measures recommended to\nDr. Prince by her, brought about their own fulfilment\nbecause they were examples of that suggestive power i\nwhich a co-conscious personality can bring to bear on\npersonalities to which it stands in hypnotic relation.\nIt is only by keeping in mind the remarkable results\nof suggestion in dissociated states and the preponderating |\npart played by suggestion from within rather than from\nwithout, that we can bring any order into the multifarious ,\nphenomena of this case. One unique feature, and one |\nwhich to me seems inexplicable except in the light of\n|\nthese considerations, is the fate of the secondary person- !\nalities in the process of Doris Fischer's restoration to\nj\nhealth.\n'\nSick Doris, immediately after being installed in Dr. |\nPrince's household, and Margaret at a later date, began\nto decline in their faculties and powers ; and the decline\ntook the curious form of a gradual retrogression towards j\nchildhood and infancy before they finally disappeared.\nSick Doris was the first to be affected by the change\nof environment brought about by the removal from her\nold home. She began to lose her memories and to be\n\" out \" less, while her lost memories became absorbed by\nReal Doris who now began to come more frequently, |\nand to stay longer, as an alternating personality. As\nSick Doris's memories disappeared her manner changed,\nbecoming more cold and reserved. Her bodily anaes-\nthesia deepened until she could neither feel, taste, nor ,\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 53\nsmell. Her vision gradually narrowed and shortened.\nShe grew more childish and apathetic, she became unable\nto read, and her vocabvilary diminished until she had\nonly a very small stock of words. She finally reached\ncomplete mental infancy, not only as to the content of\nher mind, but also as to her power of thought. In the\nend she could not walk, stand, or sit, and when she could\nretrogress no farther she just ceased to come. After\nbeing the dominant personahty for nearly five years she\nmade her last appearance four months after Doris went\nto five in Dr. Prince's home.\nThe getting rid of Margaret was a much slower process,\nbut it followed the same general course as that followed\nby Sick Doris. The methods adopted to facihtate her\ndechne and departure varied in many ways from those\nfound to be efficacious with Sick Doris, but the final\nresult was in its main aspects the same. In the case\nof Margaret, however, the regression to childhood was\nmore definite and precise in regard to details, and the\nreturn to childish ways of thought and speech gave\nevidence of being a return to the ways of the life which\nshe had actually lived as an alternating personality in\nDoris's childhood.\nThis was impossible in the case of Sick Doris, for she\nhad never been a real child in her own personality.\nWhen she first appeared she was, it is true, an infantile\npersonality as regards the content of her mind, but in\nher regression she does not seem to have retraced her\nsteps through this infantile fife. It seemed rather as if\nthe forces directing the process of her extinction had led\nher backwards through an abstract sort of infancy which\nwas not the infancy of anyone in particular. With\nMargaret it was different. It appeared to be her own\nchildhood she was retracing. Moreover, there was this\nfurther difference, that when the mental regression of\nMargaret had brought her to the age of five, she dis-\nappeared and came no more. She never became truly\ninfantile as Sick Doris had done.\nThe fate of Sick Doris and of Margaret had been the\nsubject of much speculation by these personahties them-\n\f54 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nselves and also by Sleeping Margaret and Dr. Prince.\nAt the beginning of his treatment of the case Dr. Prince\nregarded Sick Doris as the primary personality, and his\nefforts were directed towards reinstating her as the per-\nmanent personahty and banishing Margaret. He some-\ntimes told Sick Doris that Margaret appeared to be\nweakening and that eventually she would be got rid of.\nBut Margaret was of a different opinion. She said she\nknew that Sick Doris would go first and teased her by\nteUing her so. Sick Doris was somewhat worried by\nMargaret's assertions but believed that Margaret would\nbe the one to go.\nAt an early period of the treatment Dr. Walker of\nthe University of Pittsburg was consulted on this matter.\nHe gave it as his opinion that Sick Doris would be\nassimilated with Real Doris but that Margaret would\nnever blend. At first Margaret's opinion of her own\nfate was that she would join up with Real Doris. \" We\nare going to be one,\" she said. But three days after\nDr. Walker had expressed his opinion she said, speaking\nof Sick Doris's decline :\n\" We don't want her, any way.\nME NEXT !\u2014loudly and archly\u2014isn't that right papa ?\n\"\nTwo days later Sleeping Margaret enters into the\ndrama for the first time since the night of her discovery.\nShe asserts that Sleeping Margaret and Margaret are in\na sense one, and she expresses the opinion that \" both\nMargarets will eventually disappear. As to Sick Doris\nshe is disappearing, '\ngoing into Real Doris,' has in good\npart already gone.\" About a week later she informs Dr.\nPrince that \" Margaret is getting to be a little child. She\nalways was a girl but she is getting younger and younger.\nI think that is probably the way that she will disappear.\n(Do you think she will come to have the mind of a\nbaby ?) Probably not really a baby, but the mind of a\nvery small girl.\" At the same time, in reply to the\nquestion : Who do you think will go first, you or Margaret ?\nshe replied : \"I don't know ;\nprobably we will go to-\ngether.\" (How do you think that S. D. will go ?)\n\" Why, she is going now Don't you see that she is\ngoing ? She remembers hardly anything. . . . She will get\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 55\nweaker and weaker, and all of a sudden she will be\ngone and not come back.\" Some weeks later when Mrs.\nPrince said something about Margaret blending with Real\nDoris, Sleeping Margaret spoke up decidedly, \" No, she\nwill disappear. The difference is that S. D. was separated\nfrom the R. D. (And wasn't Ml) No, she just came.\"\nThus early in the treatment of the case the different\npersonalities had fairly clear notions of the course they\nhad to run. At a later date Sleeping Margaret, however,\nseems to have changed her mind about her own future\nand also about her own nature.\nThe way in which Sick Doris and Margaret disappeared\nis, so far as I know, unique in the records of multiple\npersonality ; and although we may agree with Sleeping\nMargaret that no two cases are exactly ahke, it would\nseem very unhkely that this mode of disappearance of\nsecondary personahties should not have been met with\nbefore, if it is an inherent or natural pecuKarity of the\nDoris Case. I must confess that I am incKned to regard\nthe whole course followed by Sick Doris and Margaret\nin their disappearance as having been largely brought\nabout artificially,\u2014in the sense that their mode of going\nwas not a necessary part of their going. Their going\nwas necessary if Doris was to be cured, but they might\nhave been got rid of in some other way. Not that I\nwould decry Dr. Prince's management of the case. On\nthe contrary, I think no one can read his record without\na profound feeUng of admiration for his patience and his\nskill. All I mean is that if Dr. Prince, and especially\nif Sleeping Margaret, had by any chance come to have\nhad different notions as to the course to be run and the\nmeasures to be adopted, then an equally good end might\nhave been attained though the way might have been\ndifferent.\nIt is not to be supposed that suggestion from without\nis all that is necessary in a case such as this. Secondary\npersonalities, although they may be suggestible enough in\nsome respects, are often impervious to suggestions from\nwithout directed towards their own exorcism, or even\ntowards the disappearance of symptoms which seem to be\n\f56 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nwithin their control. Yet when, by any means, they can\nbe got to predict the disappearance of morbid symptoms^\nthese symptoms disappear in the same sudden and un-\naccountable way as do similar sj^mptoms in ordinary\nhysteria in response to suggestion from without.\nThis peculiarity was forced on my attention in a case\nof hysteria with incipient multiple personality which I\nreported to this Society some years ago.^ I was struck\nby the unequal success of suggestion in this case. Some\nsymptoms disappeared instantly at the first suggestion ;\nothers seemed to be quite uninfluenced, no matter how\noften, or how impressively, appropriate suggestions were\ngiven. It soon became evident that the symptoms which\nwere easily relieved were those which, in her waking\nstate, the patient asked me to relieve, or those to the\nrelief of which I had gained her free and unqualified\nassent during hypnosis. Why she came to desire the\nrelief of one symptom more than another I do not know ;\nbut it was clear that once she got the idea that I could\nremove it, the symptom in question alw^ays disappeared,\nand if she did not have such idea it did not. Sometimes\nI expressed a doubt as to my ability to remove it, but\nwhat she predicted always came to pass.\nThus so far as suggestion affects the course of cases\nof this kind it would seem essential that it should be,\nin some sense, a suggestion from within. The idea of\nthe course to be followed must somehow arise in, or gain\nadmission to, the patient's mind, and act with suggestive\nforce at some hypnotic level. The possibility of such an\noccurrence in cases of co-conscious secondary personalities\nis shown by the case I have recorded, and it may be\nuseful to bear such a possibility in mind in connection\nwith the Doris case, especially with regard to the re-\ngression to child-like states which preceded the final\ndisappearance of Sick Doris and Margaret.\nIn continuing our comparisons of the data supplied by~\nthe Doris case with those derived from other sources,\nwe are led beyond the individual features presented by\nit to a comparison of the case as a whole with other\nWroceediwjn, S.l'.R., Vol. XXVI. p. 286.\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 57\ncases of multiple personality. We may try to find out\nif knowledge of the Doris case helps us in any way to\nclassify these cases, or if we can find a place for it in\nany classification we may provisionally have adopted.\nIn attempting to classify cases of multiple personality\nwe start with the assumption that in every instance we\nhave to deal with some sort of dissociation or division\nof the self. Until such an assumption is clearly shown\nto be false or inadequate, we are not justified in ascribing\nto any other source the secondary personalities which they\nmay reveal. We must suppose that such unity and\ncontinuity as the self ordinarily displays has in some way\nbecome disrupted, and a basis of classification may be\nfound if we can discover the lines of cleavage along\nwhich such disruptions most commonly do or may take\nplace. To know where to look for these fines of cleavage\nwe must first know what sort of unity the self has and\nin what it consists.\nWe may distinguish between the unity of consciousness\nand the unity of the self. When we speak of the unity\nof consciousness we should refer only to the unity which\nis observed within the field of consciousness and to the\ncontinuity which normally chai'acterises the stream of con-\nsciousness. The unity of consciousness, thus understood,\ndepends on the immediate contiguity of the components\nof a.ny present moment of consciousness and the contiguity\nof the successive moments in the transition from one to\nanother which constitutes the stream of consciousness.\nDisruption of the unity of the field of consciousness\nis observed in the common symptoms of hysteria such as\nanaesthesia, where some part of the conscious field that\nought to be supraliminal has become subliminal. Dis-\nruptions of the continuity of the stream of consciousness\nare exhibited in the amnesia of hysterical fugues and still\nmore clearly in that of multiple personality. Such unity\nand continuity of consciousness is a necessary and im-\nportant part of our conception of personality, but in this\nthere is also impHed a higher unity of the self which is\nnot dependent on a mere contiguity of elements. This\nunity is essentially a conative unity. It is a unity and\n\f58 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\ncontinuity of interests and purposes. It is a unity that\nis not given in the structure of the mind but is some-\nthing that the self can aspire to, and it may be, by\nstruggle attain. In the struggle towards this ideal,\ncharacter is formed, and when such unity as may have\nbeen attained is disrupted the resulting change in person-\nality will reveal itself change in character and\nconduct.\nThere are thus at least two directions from which we\nmay approach the problem of classification of secondary\npersonalities. From one point of view we may regard\nthem as breaches in the continuity of the stream of\nconsciousness. From another point of view they appear\nas disturbances of that relative unity of the self which\nwe know as character.\nIn a former communication to this Societj^ ^ I tried to\ndivide all secondary personalities into two great groups,\nthe basis of division being the memory relations existing\nbetween the different selves. In the first group, of which\nthe BI and BIV personalities of the Beauchamp case are\nexamples, there is reciprocal amnesia between the different\nselves. BI had none of BIV's memories and BIV had\nnone of BI's. When BIV succeeded BI as an alternating\npersonality, BIV knew nothing of what BI had been doing\nduring the time that BI was \" out \" ; and when BI\nsucceeded BIV, BI was equally ignorant of what BIV\nhad been doing.\nIn the second group, of which \" Sally \" of the Beau-\nchamp case is an example, the amnesia occurs in one\ndirection only. BI did not know Sally, but Sally knew\nBI. When Sally gave place to BI, BI came on the scene\nquite ignorant of what Sally had just been doing, hwt\nwhen Sally succeeded BI she had full knowledge of what\nBI had been doing. Moreover, Sally claimed to have been\npresent as a co-conscious personality, distinct from\nBI, during the period of BI's emergence, and to have\nbeen aware, at all times, of BI's thoughts and actions.\nSecondary personalities of this kind may be referred to\nas belonging to the co-conscious type.\n1 Pro<:ntdinu!>, S. P. R. , Vol. XXVI. , p. 2.57.\n'\n'\n'\n'\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 59\nOn reading the Doris record we are at once struck by\nthe fact that all the personalities, with the negligible\nexception of S. R. D., may be arranged in a co-conscious\nseries. If we regard the personalities in such a series\nas having different thresholds we may say that the\npersonahty formed at a higher level is always amnesic\nfor the personalities that may occur below it, while the\npersonahty formed at a lower level is always co-conscious\nwith those that may occur above it. Thus, in the Doris\ncase, as we have seen, S. M. knew all the thoughts and\nfeeUngs and actions of all the other personahties. M.\nwas ignorant of S. M., but knew all the others above\nher in the series. S. D. had no direct knowledge of\nM.'s experiences and was also ignorant of S. M., but she\nknew the experiences of R. D. R. D. had no direct\nknowledge of any of her secondary states.\nDivisions of the self based upon amnesia and co-\nconsciousness, although interesting to the psychologist,\nare not the ones that appeal most strongly to the ordinary\nreader. So long as a man's character is but little altered,\na gap in his memory of his own doings excites little\nwonder or comment. But if he shows any marked\nchange in his character and conduct, whether it be\naccompanied by loss of memory or not, his friends will\nsay he is \" a different man.\" And so it may be that,\nin the history of Doris Fischer, many will be more im-\npressed b\\^ the differences in the characters of the person-\nalities than by the pecuharities of the memory relations\nsubsisting between them. It would seem very desirable\nthat some classification of secondary personalities, based\nupon character rather than upon memory, should be\nattempted.\nThe most superficial examination of ourselves or our\nfellows will reveal to us that when we speak of unity\nof character we are referring to an ideal unity, and that\nin actual Ufe we know hardly any but a relative unity\nin this respect. We are all subject to moods in which\nour capacities and achievements fall short or surpass those\nthat we regard as pertaining to our true selves. At\ntimes we may follow interests and pursue ends that are\n\f60 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [PART\ninconsistent or incompatible with our main purposes, and\nonly the stern necessities of life may debar us from giving\nrein to these different sides of our character. For most\nof us some limitation of interests and systematization of\npurposes must be submitted to. William James expressed\nthis in his own inimitable way when he wrote about the\nrivalry and conflict of the different selves that may be\nfound in all of iis.\n' With most objects of desire,\" he says, \" physical\nnature restricts our choice to but one of many repre-\nsented goods, and even so it is here. I am often con-\nfronted by the necessity of standing by one of my\nempirical selves and relinquishing the rest. Not that I\nwould not, if I could, be both handsome and fat and\nwell dressed, and a great athlete and make a million a\nyear, be a wit, a hon-vivavt, and a lady-killer, as well as\na philosopher, a philanthropist, statesman, warrior, and\nAfrican explorer, as well as a '\ntone-poet '\nand saint.\nBut the thing is simply impossible. The miiUonaire's-\nwork would run counter to the saint's ; and the hon-\nvivant and the philanthropist would trip each other up ;\nthe philosopher and the lady-killer could not well keep-\nhouse in the same tenement of clay. Such different\ncharacters may conceivably at the outset of life be alike\npossible to a man. But to make any one of them\nactual, the rest must more or less be suppressed.\" ^\nWhen a splitting of personality occurs these suppressed\nselves seem to find their opportunity, and we may some-\ntimes interpret the character of a secondary personality\nas being the outcome of tendencies, potential in the\noriginal structure of the self, which had been suppressed\nor subordinated to the purposes that had been chosen\nand the ends that had been pursued.\nIn James' list of the empirical selves which he, with\nsome reluctance, put aside, no mention is made of one\nwhich, consciously or unconsciously, is common, perhaps,\nto all mankind. James may have been of too robust a\nnature ever consciously to feel the wish to be a child\nagain ; but weaker spirits, when they find life hard,.\n^ Principles of Psycholoyy, Vol. I. pp. 309-310.\n\ftxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality . 61\ntnow well the craving for the dependence and irresponsi-\n\"bility of childhood. The self that does not want to grow\nup may be detected in some of the most lovable of our\nadult friends ; and when dissociation occui's we need not\nbe surprised to find that sometimes a child-hke secondary\npersonality is revealed.\nSeveral examples of this may be found in the records.\n\" Twoey \" and \" The Boy \" in the case of Alma Z. were\nchild-like personalities. More than one of the secondary\nstates of Mary Barnes exhibited childish traits. Mx.\nHanna, in his secondary state, was described as being\n\" pure and innocent as a child.\" The secondary state\nof Mary Reynolds was child-hke in its cheerful gaiety and\nboisterous love of jests. Sally, of the Beauchamp case,\nwas incorrigibly a child. And now in the Doris case\nwe have Margaret,\u2014one of the most fascinating and\nlovable of all the child personalities revealed in these\nstates. Further, it may be noted, that the '\u2022\ncontrols\n\"'\nin mediumistic trance have not infrequently had the\nsemblance of being child personalities.\nThus, we might classify secondary personalities according\nas they are child-like or grown-up, but it is doubtful if\nsuch a division would be very helpful. There are perhaps\nmore fundamental lines of cleavage to be discovered\nalong which disruptions of the unity of the self may\ntake place.\nIf we examine character as a whole and try to see of\nwhat elements it is built up, or along what lines it grows,\nwe may notice that it displays certain features which\ncorrespond to the three fundamental modes of our being\nconscious. We know objects, we are affected by them,\nand we act upon them. So we may say we have an\nintellectual or cognitive character, an emotional character,\nand a practical character. Our intellectual character\nexpresses the whole of our power to know and to think,\nbut like each of the modes of experience it requires for\nits fulfilment the co-operation of the other two. Growth\nin knowledge is accompanied by and dependent on grow^th\nin interest and desire. In the main we think and know\nthe things that are of practical importance to us, though\n\f62 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [PABT\nat the higher levels of development thinking and knowing\nmay obtain an interest on their own account. Our\nknowledge to be of use must be organized into systems\nwhich are at least congruous and coherent within them-\nselves, and, as an ideal, into systems which are congruous\nand coherent one with another.\nThe intellectual character by itself is a relatively un-\nimportant part of man's personality. His knowledge\ngrows in the service of his interests and desires, and\nthese are shown by what he does rather than by what\nhe knows. Our emotions reveal our interests in things\nand our attitude towards them, and our whole interest\nin things and our attitude towards them form our\nemotional character. In the development of the emotional\ncharacter the primary emotions and their complex com-\nbinations undergo a gradual systematization. This is in\npart effected by the objects that arouse them, since they\nbelong to particular spheres of interest such as material,\nsocial, moral and religious spheres. But the emotions\naroused by any object will depend on the aspect pre-\nsented, for different emotions may be aroused by the same\nobject under different aspects or situations. Such a\nsystem of emotions organised about an object has been\ntermed by Mr. Shand a sentiment, and the formation\nof sentiments is the most important factor in the growth\nof the emotional character.\nIt is not very profitable, however, to consider the\nemotional character apart from the practical character.\nDoing is the end of both knowing and feeling. Our\npractical character is being formed when our interest is\nin what we shall do, rather than in what we know or\nhow we feel. It grows out of the striving aspect of\nexperience, but implies knowledge of ends that are\ndesirable. It also implies the power to choose from the\nends that may be represented in consciousness, those that\nare most desirable, and ability to control the impulses\nthat are opposed to their realization. Success in the\nbuilding up of the practical character depends on habitua-\ntion in the seeking of right ends, in the habitual acting\nup to ideals and resolves. It is this actual seeking of\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 63\nends that distinguishes the practical character from the\nintellectual and emotional characters.\nThe three characters can be considered separately only\nas abstractions. Each of them may have a unity within\nitself, but the unity of character as a whole requires\ntheii- integration ; and any want of balance, harmony and\ncohesion between them may determine a line of cleavage\nalong which personality may disintegrate.\nThe Doris case seems to show some evidence of dis-\nintegration along such lines of cleavage. Sleeping Margaret\nwas the embodiment of the intellectual character. She\nwas cold and unemotional and she never did anything.\nShe appeared to be of a \" highly analytical and philo-\nsophical mind,\" she was \" never known to wander in her\nspeech or to oscillate ui the clearness of her understand-\ning.\" \" Her facial expression was usually that of philo-\nsophical calmness, though she would ofter smUe sedately,\nor even break out into laughter.\"\nIf Sleeping Margaret was all intellect, Margaret was all\nfeeling and emotion. She was demonstrative and affec-\ntionate. Though amiable as a rule she had occasional\nfits of sullenness and even of rage. She was a child of\nthe emotions with the emotions of a child. She never\ndeveloped beyond the age of ten, but it was her intellec-\ntual expansion that first became curtailed. At one time she\nused to assist Real Doris with her lessons, but two years\nbefore the schooling was over she ceased to help because\nthe exercises had become too advanced. She had the\nemotional character's dislike of monotony and restraint.\nThe Real Doris of those school days had no easy time, for\nincessantly there emerged in her consciousness the clamours\nof Margaret, '\u2022\nCome on ! let's go out !\n\" or Margaret would\ncome as an alternating personality and cut some ridiculous\ncaper which set the room in a giggle.\nIf Sleeping Margaret was the intellectual side and\nMargaret the emotional side of Doris, then Sick Doris\nwas preponderatingly the practical side. After her advent\nshe was the only one of the group who appeared to do\nthings. For five years she was the dominant personality\nwho bore the brunt of all the hardships and the excessive\n\f64 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nand prolonged exertions which the poverty of the family\nentailed. She was characterized by woodenness of ex-\npression. She was lacking in humour, in conceptions\nof the abstract, and in other respects. To the end she\nwas lacking on the side of the affections, but she was a\nslave to her narrow conceptions of duty.\nThis way of looking at secondary personalities may\nseem fanciful and not very profitable. And indeed it\nis likely that more commonly we should find the line of\ncleavage running through the emotional and practical\ncharacters, which are hardly separable, rather than\nbetween them. Could we do so it would be consonant\nwith our most recent knowledge of the nature and source\nof psychical dissociation. Everything points to the\nemotional life as being the source from which the dis-\nintegrating forces are derived. Here is to be found the\nsubterranean fire which in volcanic action bursts the\nbonds that keep the self a unity of endeavour.\nThe emotional conflict that ensues when incompatible\nwishes arise in the mind may be, as the Freudians main-\ntain, the one constant factor in all psychical dissociation.\nBut to search for the lines of cleavage which may thus\nbe established would necessitate a long and arduous\nexamination of the unconscious roots of the emotional\nlife. The knowledge we already possess on this matter\nhas not yet, so far as I know, been applied to well-\nmarked cases of multiple personality, and this is neither\nthe time nor the place to attempt it ; but when it is\ndone we shall perhaps be within sight of some basis\nwhereon to found a scientific or natural classification of\nthese states.\nIn the meantime we may make ixse of provisional\nclassifications of a moi'e superficial kind, and we may here,\nas in other matters, arrange our data in groups determined\nby the end we have in view. We have good authority\nfor saying that each science or art may form its classifi-\ncation of things \" according to the properties which fall\nwithin its special cognizance, or of which it must take\naccount in order to accomplish its peculiar practical end.\"\nAs students of Psychical Research we may ask whether\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 65\nsecondary personalities show any peculiarities which fall\nwithin our special province. If they do, we may use\nthese peculiarities as a basis for classification.\nIn many of the recorded cases of multiple personality\nsome evidence of the occurrence of supernormal phenomena\nhas been given, and if there are any cases in which there\nis no such evidence, then we may divide all cases of\nmultiple personality into those which provide evidence of\nthe supernormal and those which do not. Or, more\nconveniently, all the secondary selves revealed in these\ncases may be divided into those that give evidence of\npossessing supernormal powers and those for which no\nsuch claim can be made.\nThat in the cases hitherto recorded some apparently\nsupernormal phenomena have been observed cannot be\ndenied. In some instances the prejudice of the observer\nhas almost blinded him to their occurrence or has led\nhim to record them only shamefacedly in a footnote.\nIn other instances his credulity has caused him to see\nevidence of spirit possession or obsession in the common\nsymptoms of hysteria as well as in less usual phenomena.\nIn the earlier records of the Doris case we are fortunate\nin having had an observer who, if not trained in the\nmethods of science, was at all events apparently scrupu-\nlously careful and unbiassed. Towards the end of his\nconduct of the case Dr. Prince was undoubtedly more\nfavourably inclined towards spiritistic hypotheses ; and in\nthe observations of Dr. Hyslop, set out at great length\nin the third volume of the record, we recognize the work\nof a spiritist whose views are, I imagine, of an extreme\nkind.\nThe incidents recorded by Dr. Prince, of which some\nsupernormal explanation may be called for, are numerous,\nbut not many of them come up to the evidential standard\nrequired by our Society. Dr. Prince often has to admit,\nabout some particular incident, that taken by itself it\ncannot be regarded as evidential, and that it has to be\nread in the light of other similar incidents in other parts\nof the record. This is a procedure we are only too prone\nto adopt in the investigation of the supernormal. As\n\f66 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nrule of method it is probably fundamentally false. A\ncollection of half-truths can never prove the whole truth\nabout anything. The accumulation of doubtful cases\nwould rather tend to magnify the doubt.\nAll the personalities in the Doris case are said to have\nhad supernormal experiences. The Real Doris claimed\nthat when she was quite small she used sometimes to\nsee things which afterwards came true. When she was\naway from home, at work, she sometimes got the im-\npression of seeing her mother doing something, and when\nshe got home at night would learn that her mother had\nbeen doing that thing just at the time she saw her.\nThe last experience of the kind was on the day before\nher mother died. She saw, \" pictured in the glass panel\nof the door,\" her mother lying on a lounge with her\nface turned towards the wall. The vision was repeated\nthree times, and at last Doris became alarmed and went\nhome. She found her mother in the position foreseen in\nthe vision, very ill and half-conscious. She died a few\nhours later.\nAfter the advent of Sick Doris the Real Doris appears\nto have lost this clairvoyant faculty, but she was still\nsubject to auditory and visual hallucinations. On one\noccasion she said she was sitting in the hen-yard holding\na chicken, looking down at it. She saw a shadow, looked\nvip, and saw her dead mother, just as plainly as she had\never seen her, dressed in a calico dress which she wore\nwhen Doris was a child about eight years old. The\noccurrence of this vision was corroborated by Margaret\nand Sleeping Margaret, but, as Dr. Prince says, \" of course\nthis isn't evidence.\" :\nSick Doris not infrequently during her first year had\na hallucination of the mother standing or walking at her\nright side. Sometimes she felt a touch, or she became\notherwise conscious of a presence, and turned, only to\nget a fleeting glimpse. Sleeping Margaret said that\n\" S. D. had these apparitions, R. D. never. S. D. never\nhad seen the mother living, yet she saw her as she\nlooked in her house wrapper. Perhaps it was from M.\nthinking a great deal about the mother.\"\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multi-pie Personality. 67\nOne clairvoyant incident in which S. D. was the per-\ncipient is recorded in some detail. \" (What are you\nthinking about ? )\nSomething I would like to ask about\nAdelaide. (Well, ask it.) But it is silly ... I would\nlike to find out if she was looking into a shop-window\nbetween one and two o'clock to-day. I imagined she\nwas. It must have been after quarter past one. She\nwas dressed in blue and wore a turban. Her back was\nturned, and she was stooping and looking at something\nin a dry-goods store window. I don't know what it\nwas, but it seems as if it were something like a cushion.\"\nIn the evening Dr. Prince called up Adelaide by tele-\nphone. \" (Were you out between 1.15 and 2 tliis after-\nnoon ?) Yes. (Where chd you go ?) Let me see.\nI went to a drug-store. (How were you dressed ?) In\na blue suit. (Did you wear a turban ?) Yes. . . . (Did\nyou look intently into a shop window ?) Yes, I believe\nI did. (What Idnd of a shop ?) A dry-goods store.\n(Was it a cushion that you were looking at ?) I believe\nso,\u2014yes.\" On the following day Adelaide was seen by\nDr. Prince and made a statement about her visit to the\ndrug-store. On the way, she said, she had stopped and\nexamined a pillow-cushion in a dry-goods shop window.\nShe had almost forgotten the fact when Dr. Prince called\nher up, but afterwards recalled it distinctly.\nIt is unfortmiate that corroboration of the veridical\ncharacter of S. D.'s vision was obtained in response to\nso many leading questions. Dr. Prince says he had to\nask them \" to recall so trivial an incident as looking\ninto the shop-window.\" But even so, they might surely\nhave been worded less suggestively than \" Did you wear\na turban ?\n\" \" Was it a cushion that you were looking\nat ?\n\" For evidential purposes it is probably better to\nfail to get corroboration at all than to get it in such\na way.\nThe majority of the supernormal incidents in the case\nare connected with Margaret. She is the only one who\nshowed what appears to have been genuine telepathic\npower. One of the best examples is that in which she\ntold Dr. Prince :\n\" You wrote to a man named Prince\n\f68 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nto-day^\u2014to Dr. Prince. . . . You wote about Doris. . . .\nYou asked him how someone was getting on.\"' The facts\nwere that Dr. Prince had, that afternoon, without acquaint-\ning anyone with his intention, written to Dr. Morton\nPrince for the first time. He wrote chiefly about Doris.\nHe did not ask how anyone was getting on, but he did\nvery distinctly debate in his mind whether to ask him\nif Miss Beauchamp was still mentally stable. He took\npains to make it impossible that anyone should see him\nwrite either the letter or the addi'ess on the envelope,\nmentioned to no one that he had written, and while alone\nput the letter where no one could possibly get at it.\nWhen Margaret made announcements of this kind it\nwas always after she had gazed steadily, with a look of\ninterested amusement, into Dr. Prince's eyes. She\nclaimed that she saw, not what he was consciously\nthinking at the moment, but what was \" passing like a\nparade down underneath.\"\nOn another occasion Margaret, who had been kept in\nignorance of the existence of Sleeping Margaret, surprised\nDr. Prince hj stating that she knew there were three\npersonahties, and that Sleeping Margaret was the name\nof the third one. She said she saw it in his thoughts.\nBut the fact that this knowledge was in the possession\nof S. M. robs this instance of all evidential value so far\nas telepathy between Margaret and Dr. Prince is in\nquestion.\nAn example of what used to be called '\u2022\ntravelling\nclairvoyance \" is recorded of Margaret. She had claimed\nthat she could leave Doris and go back to her old home\nand see what was happening there. Dr. Prince asked\nher if she could go anywhere else and she said she could\n\" if Doris knows the people.\" So Dr. Prince asked her\nto go to the house of a Mr. S.\n\u2014\" the first house after\na big one on the left \" in a certain avenue. When she\n\" came back \" she reported : \"I went into the hall. I\nthink it was the right house, the second from Colorado\nAvenue on the left. (Yes.) I only saw a httle girl,\ngoing through the hall. Her hair was cut bobbed, and\nshe had a ribbon on one side. I could see into the dining\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 69\nroom, and saw dishes on the table. There was no one\nelse. I was scared and did not go into any other part\nof the house,\u2014just the haU where the little girl was.\n(Was there any food on the table ?) No, just dishes.\"\nNext day Dr. Prince called up Mrs. S. and ascertained\na number of facts which were favourable to the view,\nthough not very conclusive, that some clairvoyant faculty\nhad been in operation. One of these facts was that\n\" Marie did . . . pass through that haU alone at just\nabout the time of M.'s alleged vision.\" At a later date\nMargaret declared that \" she made a mistake and entered\nthe wi'ong house, but that the httle girl whom she saw\nwas really Marie ; that she had seen her since and\nrecognized her.\" Afterwards Sleeping Margaret stoutly\naffirmed the same. Here Dr. Prince leaves the matter.\nHe seems to have made no effort to find out if Marie\nhad passed through the hall of this second house about\nthe time of M.'s alleged vision. He was becoming in-\nclined to accept any declaration of Sleeping Margaret as\ngood evidence which needed no corroboration.\nAlthough Margaret is the only one who gives good\nevidence of possessing supernormal powers, most readers\nof the record will come away from it with the impression\nthat Sleeping Margaret is the source, more than any of\nthe other personahties, of the supernormal atmosphere\nwhich pervades the story as a whole. Yet when we try\nto find out why this should be so, we find it difficult to\nexplain. Apart from the claims she made, towards the\nend, as to her own nature and powers, there is httle in\nthe record to suggest that she needs any supernormal\nexplanation. But there is good evidence of Dr. Prince's\ngrowing behef that Sleeping Margaret was something\nsupernatural, and this behef is subtly suggested to the\nreader throughout hundreds of pages of a very engrossing\nstory. In the end one is almost ready to beUeve, with\nDr. Prince, that Sleeping Margaret is a spirit.\nWhen she first began to talk about herself Sleeping\nMargaret seemed to think that she and Margaret were\nin some sense one, and, consequently, that when Margaret\nwent she would go too ; but as time went on she made\n\f70 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nmany assertions about herself which are incompatible\nwith her earlier statements. At first she implied that there\nwas, to begin with, a very close relation between herself\nand Margaret, if, indeed, they were not one and the\nsame personality, but that they had become \" separated\n\"\nafter Doris came to live with Dr. Prince. Later she\nclaimed that she came as a mature personahty when\nDoris was three years old. But when Dr. Prince asked\nher to explain how she could have come from baby\nDoris and have a mature mind, all she could say in reply\nwas, \" Well, Margaret was brighter than Real Doris.\"\nHer new claims were obviously so much opposed to her\noriginal statements that she seemed embarrassed when\nthe question of her own origin and status was broached,\nand for a long time she either denied knowledge on\nthese points or refused to discuss them.\nDr. Prince was greatly puzzled to account for Sleeping\nMargaret's character and powers, and on November 10th,\n1911, he suggested to her that perhaps she was a spirit.\nThis she strenuously denied, and she persisted in her\ndenial for many months. During the first period of his\ninvestigation of the case Dr. Prince would seem to have\nhad no partiality towards a spiritistic interpretation of\nany of the phenomena. But in September, 1911, Dr.\nHj^slop paid him a visit and examined Doris. Prom this\ntime onward Dr. Prince's attitude appears to have under-\ngone a gradual change, and he became obviously more\ndisposed to beUeve that Sleeping Margaret was some\nkind of spirit possession.\nThis change in Dr. Prince's attitude may not have been\nwithout effect on the opinion of Sleeping Margaret herself.\nIn her early references to her own going she did not\nappear to make any distinction between the nature of\nher own final disappearance and that of Margaret. But\nas time went on her remarks on this topic were con-\nsonant with Dr. Prince's growing opinion that she was not\na mere secondary personality in the sense that Sick Doris\nand Margaret were. In June, 1913, she said :\n\" I shall\ngo a day or two before Margaret does. ... I shall be\nin sight of her [R. D.] after that until I know that\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 71\nshe is safe. ... I will always know how she is getting\non, and if I am needed I shall come back.\"\nHer prediction that she would go a day or two before\nMargaret did was not fulfilled, but, she said, \" this was\nnot because she was deceived in her foresight, but because,\nfor what appeared to her good reasons, she changed her\nmind.\" The only ostensible reasons for her remaining\nafter Margaret's departure (April 19th, 1914) were that\nDr. Prince liked her to come and desired her to give\nsome proof, which she had promised, regarding her real\nnature.\nAlthough in 1911 she had denied that she was a spirit,\nnevertheless her claims regarding her own nature and\npowers became, from that time onwards, more and more\nconsonant with such a belief. She maintained that when\nshe chose she could \" go away,\" that is, leave the body\nof Doris, and, when away, she said she was attending\nto her own affairs. Towards the end her occupation\nwhen away was said to be the preparation of the \" proof\n\"\nwhich she had promised regarding her own nature. This\nproof, so often promised, never came ; but she asserted\nthat an attempt towards it had been made in the course\nof some experiments in automatic writing which Dr.\nPrince had conducted with Doris.\nJust as she failed to give the proof, so also she failed\nto give any actual demonstration of supernormal powers.\nShe did, however, take credit for one incident which\ngreatly impressed Dr. Prince. One night, in the midst\nof a graphic and interesting dream, there was suddenly\ninterjected into it his name, \" Walter,\" thriUing in its\ndistinctness, which instantly shattered the dream and\nwoke him. Sleeping Margaret claimed that it was she\nwho called him. She said she had been practising to\nsee if she could speak while Real Doris was asleep with-\nout waking her. \" I began,\" she explained, \" by saying\n'\nPapa ' softly, I spoke louder and louder and she paid\nno attention, then I said '\nWalter,' because that is a\ngood round word, and finally I spoke it loudly.\" Dr.\nPrince could not understand how she made him hear at\nsuch a distance (25 ft.) and why it did not wake Mrs.\n\f72 T.

So he\nasks :\n\" Did she make me hear by normal utterance, or\ndid she speak to me '\nherself,' as she some time ago\nintimated that she would try to do\u2014that is, not through\nReal Doris's hps ?\n\"\nAlthough at this time Sleeping Margaret does not seem\nto have claimed that she made Dr. Prince hear other-\nwise than \" through the ordinary channels of sense,\"\nDr. Prince's doubt seems to have found congenial soil\nin her mind. Some months later, at a time when Dr.\nPrince was pressing her for \" the proof,\" she began to\nclaim that on various occasions she had tried, unsuccess-\nfully, to make him hear at a distance. Then, once again,\nDr. Prince had a dream spoilt by the irruption of the\nword Walter,\" and again he was mystified as to the\nsource of the sound which woke him. He canvasses the\nexplanations which might be proposed by an outsider.\nThese are, (1) Mrs. Prince was fooling him, (2) Mrs. Prince\nspoke his name in her sleep, (3) the word was uttered\nby the lips of the girl in her room and he heard it\nwhere he lay. (4) the girl, in normal or abnormal state,\nactually came to his side and uttered the word. All\nof these he finds good grounds for rejecting, although\nif the word was really uttered by anyone his third hypo-\nthesis would seem to afford the most likely explanation.\nDr. Prince's slight deafness, and the 40 feet which separated\nhim from the sleeping Doris, are more than counter-\nbalanced by the rapport which existed between them..\nUnfortunately, however, for the whole story, Sleeping\nMargaret said she was not responsible for the voice on\nthis occasion.\nUnfortunately, also. Sleeping Margaret did not always\nspeak the truth. Indeed, this failing was common to\nall the secondary personalities in the case. Sick Dorig\nfor a long time imposed upon Dr. Prince belief in her\nhysteric fabrication that she had a diseased hip, and\ntried also to get him to think she was a great artist.\nMargaret was often detected in child-like romancing, but\nshe could not help giving notice of her inventive moods by\ndancing eyes and an amused manner. Sleeping Margaret\n\fLxxix.] The Doris Fischer Case of Multiple Personality. 73\nat first made statements about herself which are at\nvariance with later ones and was sometimes evasive in\nother matters. These departures from the truth she ex-\nplained as being due to her unwillingness at first to admit\nher true nature and her desire to shield Real Doris when\nshe thought Dr. Prince was getting too inquisitive. Dr.\nPrince was apparently not a little perturbed by the men-\ndacity of his secondary foster-children, and he is never\ntired of reiterating that Real Doris was absolutely truthful.\nSome time in August 1914 it was decided that Doris\nshould go to New York, for the purpose of taking part,\nas sitter, in some experiments which Dr. Hyslop was\nanxious to try with his medium Mrs. Chenoweth. On\nAugust 25th, in response to a request from Dr. Prince\nthat before she went to New York she should make\nsome declaration about herself. Sleeping Margaret made a\nstatement in writing in which she definitely claimed that\nshe was a spirit, and had been sent by some one liigher to\nguard Doris when she was three years old. When she\nhad finished her statement, Sleeping Margaret said :\n\" There,\nyou may beHeve as much of that as you like, and you\nmay question me about it if you want to.\"\nWith the visit to Nev\/ York the story of Doris Fischer\nenters upon a new phase. At this point Dr. Prince's\nrecord comes to an end and Dr. Hyslop takes up the\ntale. The atmosphere now is frankly spiritistic, and\nperhaps only those who have had personal experience of\nsuch phenomena as Dr. Hyslop records are justified in\ncriticising either his methods or his conclusions. These\nare far removed from the methods and conclusions of\northodox science, and also from those of many workers\nin Psychical Research whose opinions are entitled to\nrespectful consideration.\nDr. Hyslop's contention is that the phenomena of\nsecondary personality are often demonstrably due to dis-\ncarnate spirits. He admits that \" we shall have first\nto prove the existence of spirits in order to apply the\nhypothesis to cases of secondary personality in any form\nwhatever.\" But, needless to say, he does not prove the\nexistence of spirits. He assumes that this has been\n\f74 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nalready done. He says, \" I take that fact as adequately\nproved for all intelligent people.\" He appeals to the\nwhole cumulative mass of facts on record, and he dis-\nmisses telepathy from account \" as not worth serious\nconsideration as a rival of spiritistic theories.\" The\nadoption of such an attitude in the present state of our\nknowledge can only alienate the sympathies of many who\nare ready to approach, with open minds, all the problems\nof Psychical Research.\n\fLXXix.] Psychological Foundations of Belief in Spirits. 75\nIV.\nTHE PSYCHOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF\nBELIEF IN SPIRITS\nBy C. G. Jxjng, M.D., LL.D.\nRead at a General Meeting of the Society on July 4, 1919.\nIf we look back into the past of mankind, we find\n\u2014\namong many other religious convictions\u2014a universally\nspread belief in the existence of phantoms or ethereal\nbeings dwelling in the neighbourhood of men, and influenc-\ning them invisibly, yet verj^ powerfully. These beings\nare frequently supposed to be the spirits, or souls, of\nthe dead. This belief is to be met with among most highly\ncivilized men, as well as among Australian negroes who\nare still living at the level of the palaeolithic age. Among\nWestern peoples, however, belief in the influence of\nspirits has been counteracted by the development of\nnatural science and inteUectual criticism during the last\n150 years, so that among the educated of to-day it\nhas been almost completely suppressed together with\nother ultra-scientific convictions.\nBut just as these latter beliefs still exist among the\nmasses, belief in spirits also is far from being entirely\nextinguished. The \" haunted house,\" for instance, has\nnot yet disappeared from the most business-like or intellec-\ntual cities, nor has the peasant yet ceased to believe\nin the bewitching of his cattle. On the contrary, a\nrecrudescence of belief in spirits occurred even in an\nage of materialism, which is the inevitable consequence\nof intellectual enlightenment. It was not a recrudescence\nof obscure superstitions, but of an interest in its essence\n\f76 C. G. Jung, M.D., LL.D. [part\n'\nscientific, an intense desire to direct the searchlight of\n'\ntruth on to the dark chaos of facts. The illustrious\n'\nnames of Myers, Sidgwick, Gurney, Wallace, Crookes,\n^\nZoellner and many other prominent men, are associated\n'\nwith the rebirth and the rehabilitation of the ancient i\n'\nbelief in spirits. Even if the real nature of the observed\n'\nfacts be disputed, even if the explorers may be accused [\nof errors, and sometimes of self-deception, there still\n'\nbelongs to them the immortal merit of having thrown\nthe whole of their authority on to the side of non-material\nfacts, regardless of public disapproval. They faced aca-\ndemic prejudices, and did not shrink from the cheap j\nderision of their contemporaries ; even at a time when |\nthe intellect of the educated classes was spellbound by i\nthe new dogma of materialism, they dvevi public attention 'i\nto phenomena of an irrational nature, contrary- to accepted\nconvictions.\nThese men typify the reaction of the human mind\nagainst the senseless and desolating materialistic view.\nConsidered from the standpoint of history it is not to\nbe wondered at that so-called \" spiritual \" phenomena\nshould be used as an efficient weapon against the\nmere testimony of the senses, because belief in spirits\nhas always been a defence against mere sensationalism. I\nThis is the case with the primitive man, whose complete\ndependence upon nature makes concrete circumstance\nof the greatest importance for him. One must remember\nthe manifold distresses and needs of his life, placed\namongst hostile neighbours and dangerous animals, and\noften harrowed by a merciless nature. His keen senses,\nhis cupidity, his deficient self-control, all expose him to i\nadverse experiences. Hence he is always in danger\nof losing that mystic and supernatural something which\nalone makes man a man. But his belief in spirits, or\nrather in the spiritual, delivers him from the fetters\nof a merely tangible and visible world again and again.\nIt is this irrational function that forces on him the l\ncertainty of spiritual reality, whose laws and demands\nare to be followed as carefully and as conscientiously\nas those relating to physical nature. Primitive man\n1\n\fLxxix.] Psychological Foundations of Belief in Spirits. 11\nreally lives in two worlds. This concrete world is for\nhim at the same time a spiritual world. The objective\nworld is undeniable, and for him the spiritual world has\nan equally positive existence. This is not only his\nopinion, but rather a naive perception of spiritual pheno-\nmena, projected from his unconscious on to the concrete\nobject. Wherever such naivete is lost through the dis-\nillusioning touch of contact with Western civilization\nand its disastrous \" enlightenment,\" then also his feelings\nof awe in relation to the spiritual law disappear, and\nconsequently he degenerates. Even Christianity cannot\nsave him from degeneration, because in order to have\na beneficial effect on man, such a highly developed\nreligion demands a highly dilierentiated psyche.\nThus \" spiritual \" phenomena are for the primitive an\nimmediate experience of an ideal or spiritual reality.\nIf it be asked, what are primitive \" spirit \" phenomena,\nwe may answer that the seeing of apfaritions is the\nmost frequent phenomenon. It is generally assumed\nthat this seeing of apparitions is commoner among primi-\ntives than among civilized people, and that it is due\nto nothing but superstition. It is generally held that\neducated people do not have such visions, unless they\nare iU. It is quite certain that civilized man makes\nuse of the hypothesis of spirits incomparably less\nfrequently than the primitive. In my view, however,\nand according to my experience as a physician, the\npsychological phenomenon which the primitive attributes\nto a spirit is quite as common among civilized men.\nThe only difference is that where a primitive speaks\nof ghosts, the European speaks of dreams and phantasies\nand neurotic symptoms, and attributes less importance\nto them than the primitive does. He gives them too\nlittle weight, and on account of this undervaluation the\nEuropean regards many things as morbid which, under\nanother aspect, would be highly interesting and highly\nimportant. Therefore, owing to this rationalizing, what\nare living entities for the primitive become for him\nmorbid symptoms. Men's perceptions are the same as\nthey always were, but we interpret them in a different\n\f78 C. G. Jung, M.D., LL.D. [part\nway, and the modern way enfeebles them, making an\nincomprehensible illness of them. But the psychological\nfact in itself is not invalidated by a modern interpretation.\nIf, indeed, a highly civilized and enlightened European\nIS obliged to live in primitive conditions for a long time,\nit often happens that he has some unusual experiences\nwhich defy a rationalistic interpretation.\nOne of the essential determinants of belief in spirits\nIS the dream. Persons appear in most dreams, and the\nprimitive believes them to be spirits or souls. The dream\nhas for him an incomparably higher value than for a\nciviUzed man. He is usually a good deal taken up with\nhis dreams ;\nhe talks much of them and attributes an\nextraordinary importance to them. When he talks of\nhis dreams he is frequently unable to discriminate between\nthem and actual facts. They are quite real to him. A\ncompetent explorer of primitive psychology says :\n\" Le\nreve est le vrai dieu des primitifs.\" To the civiKzed\nman as a rule dreams appear to be valueless ;\nyet there\nare some individuals who attribute a high importance to\nthem, at least to particularly weird and impressive dreams.\nSuch impressive dreams make one understand why the\nprimitive should suppose them to be inspirations. It\nIS of the essence of an inspiration that there must be\nsomething that inspires, a spirit or a ghost, although\nthe modern mind would not draw such a conclusion.\nThe appearance of the dead in a dream seems a par-\nticularly strong argument for the primitive belief in\nspirits.\nFurther grounds for belief in spirits are found in psycho-\ngenic nervous diseases, especially those of a hysterical\ncharacter, which are not rare among primitives. As\nsuch troubles arise out of psychological conflicts, mostly\nof an unconscious order, they appear to the naive mentality .1\nas if caused by certain persons, living or dead, who are\nin some way connected with the individual's conflict. If\nthe person is dead, the assumption that his spirit is\npersecuting the living is easily arrived at. As the origin\nof pathogenic conflicts frequently goes back to early\nchildhood and is connected with memories of the parents,\n\fLXXix.] Psychological Foundations of Belief in Spirits. 79\nit naturally follows that the spirits of relatives are par-\nticularly revered or feared by primitives ; hence ancestor\nworship is universally spread. Worship of the dead,\nin the first place, is undertaken as a protection against\ntheir malevolence. Experience in the psychological treat-\nment of nervous patients shows again and again how\ngreat the influence of the parents is, even when they\nhave been long dead. The psychological after-effects\nof the parents are so important for an individual's fate\nthat one can easily understand the significance of ancestor\nworship.\nMental diseases have also great influence in causing\nbelief in spirits, particularly those which are accompanied\nby hallucinations, either of a delirious or katatonic char-\nacter, belonging chiefly to the Dementia Praecox class,\nwhich is the commonest form of mental disorder. Always\nand everywhere insane persons have been regarded as\npossessed by evil spirits, and this belief is supported by\nthe patients' hallucinations. The patients are less tor-\nmented by their visions than by the voices they\nhear. The voices are often those of relatives or at least\nof people connected with the patient's psychological\nconflicts. It is also fairly common to hear the voice\nof God or of the devil. It appears, of course, to the\nnaive mentality that such voices come from spirits.\nWhen speaking of belief in spirits of the dead reference\nmust also be made to belief in souls of the living, the\nlatter belief being a correlate of the former. In the\nprimitive conviction the ghost is generally the spirit\nof a dead person, hence it must before have been the\nsoul of a living person. This at least is held where\nthe belief that man has only one soul prevails. But\nman is frequently supposed to have two or more souls,\none of which is more or less independent and relatively\nimmortal. In such a case the \" spirit \" of the dead\nis only one of the several \" souls \" of the living. Hence\nit is only a part of the psyche,\u2014a psychical fragment,\nas it were. Thus belief in souls is an almost necessar}''\ncondition of belief in spirits, at least so far as the spirits\nof the dead are concerned. The primitive is convinced\n\f80 C. G. Jung, M.D., LL.D. [part\nthat there are not only such spirits, but also elementary\ndemons, who are not believed to have ever been human\nsouls or psychical fragments of them. I\nBefore discussing the grounds for belief in souls I\nwish to sum up the facts already mentioned. I have\npointed out three main sources of the belief in spirits\nwhich are accessible to science : viz. the seeing of appari-\ntions, the phenomenon of the dream, and the pathological\ndisorders of the psyche.\nThe commonest of these grounds of belief is the dream.\nWhat does modern science know of the dream ? A\ndream is a psychological product originating in the sleeping\nstate without conscious motivation. In a dream con-\nsciousness is neither fully awake nor fully extinguished ;\nthere is still a small amount of consciousness. There is,\nfor instance, nearly always some consciousness of the ego,\nbut rarely of the ego as it appears to a consciousness\niully awake. It is rather a limited ego, sometimes\npeculiarly transformed or distorted. The dream-ego is,\nas a rule, a mere fragment of the conscious ego. The\nego is a psychic complex of a particularly solid kind.\nAs sleep is seldom dreamless, we may assume that the\ncomplex of the ego rarely ceases to be active. Its\nactivity is but restricted by sleep. The psychic contents\nof the dream appear to the ego just like those external\nphenomena which appear to it in the waking state. Hence\nit happens that we find ourselves in situations like those\nin real life, but rarely exercise thought or reason about\nthem. As in our waking state things and human beings\nenter our field of vision, so in the dream, psychic contents,\nimages of different kinds enter the field of consciousness\nof the dream-ego. We do not feel as if we were pro-\nducing the dreams, but rather as if they came to us.\nThey do not submit to our direction, but obey their\nown laws. Obviously they are autonomous complexes,\nwhich form themselves by their own methods. Their\nmotivation is unconscious. We may therefore say that\nthey come from the unconscious. Thus, we must admit\nthe existence of independent psychic complexes, escaping\nthe control of our consciousness and appearing and dis-\n\fLxxix.] Psychological Foundations of Belief in Spirits. 81\nappearing according to their own laws. From our waking\nexperience we are convinced that we produce our thoughts\nand that we can produce them when we wish. We also\nthink we know where our thoughts come from, and why,\nand to what end we have them. If it should happen\nthat a thought takes possession of us against our will,\nor if it unexpectedly disappears against our will, we feel\nas if something exceptional or morbid had happened. It seems\nas if the difference between the waking and the sleeping\nstates were extraordinary. In the waking state the\npsyche is apparently controlled by our conscious motivation,\nbut in the sleeping state it seems to produce strange and\nincomprehensible ideas, which force themselves on us\nsometimes quite against our intention.\nSimilarly the vision comes like a dream, but in the\nwaking f.tate. It enters consciousness concurrently with\nthe perception of real objects, being an emergence of un-\nconscious ideas into the continuity of consciousness.\nThe same phenomenon takes place in mental disease.\nThe ear does not only perceive the vibrations of sound,\nbut it also seems to hear thoughts, which are not the\nimmediate contents of the conscious mind.^ Besides\nthe judgments made by intellect and feeling, opinions and\nconvictions arise forcing themselves upon the individual,\napparently based upon perceptions, but in reality derived\nfrom unconscious ideas. Such are delusions.\nThese t5rpes of phenomena,\u2014dreams, waking visions\nand mental disease,\u2014depend on the fact that the psyche\nas a whole is not an indivisible unity, but a more or\nless divided totality. Although the separate parts are\nconnected with each other, they yet are relatively inde-\npendent of each other. Their independence extends so\nfar that certain of the psychic fragments are very rarely,\nor perhaps never, associated with the ego. I have\ncalled those fragments autonomous complexes, and I\nfounded my theory of complexes upon their empirical\nexistence. According to this theory the ego-complex\nforms the centre of our individuality. But the ego-\n^ There are also some exceptional cases where the voices loudly\nrepeat the conscious thoughts of the individual.\n\f82 C. G. Jung, M.D., LL.D. [part\ncomplex is but one among several complexes. The other\ncomplexes are more or less associated with the ego-\ncomplex and thus far they are conscious. But they also\ncan exist for some time without being associated with\nthe ego-complex.\nA striking and well-known example thereof is the\nconversion of St. Paul. Although the moment of a con-\nversion seems sometimes qiiite sudden and unexpected, yet\nwe know from repeated experience that such a fundamental\noccurrence always has a long period of unconscious\nincubation. It is only when the preparation is complete,\nthat is to say, when the individual is ready to be con-\nverted, that the new view breaks forth with great emotion.\nSt. Paul had already been a Christian for a long time,\nbut unconsciously ; hence his fanatical resistance to the\nChristians, because fanaticism exists chiefly in individuals\nwho are compensating for secret doubts. The incident of\nhis hearing the voice of Christ on his way to Damascus\nmarks the moment when the unconscious complex of\nChristianity became conscious. That the auditory pheno-\nmenon should represent Christ is explained by the already\nexisting unconscious Christian complex. The complex,\nbeing unconscious, was projected by St. Paul on to the\nexternal world as if it did not belong to him. Unable\nto conceive of himself as a Christian, and on account of\nhis resistance to Christ, he became blind, and could\nonly regain his sight through submission to a Christian,\nthat is to say, through his complete submission to Chris-\ntianity. Psychogenic blindness is, according to my ex-\nperience, always due to an unwillingness to see, i.e.\nto understand and to accept, what is incompatible with\nthe conscious attitude. This was obviously the case with\nSt. Paul. His unwillingness to see corresiDonds with his\nfanatical resistance to Christianity. This resistance was\nnever wholly extinguished, a fact of which we have proof\nin the epistles. It broke forth at times in the fits he\nsuffered from. It is certainly a great mistake to call\nhis fits epileptic. There is no trace of epilepsy in them,\non the contrary, St Paul himself in his epistles gives\nhints enough as to the real nature of the illness. They\n\fLxxix.] Psychological Foundations of Belief in Spirits. 83\nare clearly psychogenic fits, which really mean a return\nof the old Saul-complex, repressed through conversion,\nin the same way as there had previously been a repression\nof the complex of Christianity.\nScience does not allow us consistently with intellectual\nhonesty to explain the case of St. Paul on supernatural\ngrounds. We should be compelled to do the same with\nmany similar cases within our medical experience, which\nwould lead to conclusions antagonistic both to our reason\nand feeling.\nAutonomous complexes appear in dreams and visions,\nin pathological hallucinations and delusions. Being strange\nto the ego they always appear as if externalized. In\ndreams, they are often represented as other persons ;\nin visions, they are visibly projected into space ; the\nsame is the case with voices in insane people, in so far\nas they are not ascribed to persons in the patients'\nsurroundings. Ideas of persecution are very often as-\nsociated with persons to whom the patient attributes\nthe qualities of certain of his unconscious complexes.\nThe patient feels these persons to be hostile because\nhis ego is hostile to the unconscious complex, just as\nSaul resented the complex of Christianity which he could\nnot acknowledge. He persecuted the Christians as repre-\nsentatives of his unconscious complex.\n\" Spirits,\" viewed from this standpoint, are unconscious,\nautonomous complexes which appear as projections because\nthey are not associated with the ego.\nI mentioned before that belief in souls of the living\nis a logical correlate of belief in spirits of the dead.\nWhilst spirits are felt to be strange and incompatible\nwith the ego, souls seem to belong to it. The primitive\nfeels the proximity or the influence of the spirit as some-\nthing disagreeable or dangerous or uncanny, and he is\nmuch easier in his mind when the spirit is banished. It\nis otherwise with the loss of a soul, which feels to him\nlike an iUness, and he may also attribute physical illness\nto the loss of a soul. Children may not be beaten,\nbecause their souls, if outraged, might withdraw from\nthem. So the soul is something that seems normally\n\f84 C. G. Ju7ig, M.D., LL.D. [part\nto belong to a man, but the spirits seem to be some-\nthing that normally should not be near him. He avoids\nvisiting \" haunted \" places and touching things supposed\nto be inhabited by spirits, unless he is doing so for pur-\nposes of magic.\nThe plurality of souls is a plurality of relatively\nautonomous complexes like the plurality of spirits. The\nsoul complexes seem to belong to the ego and the loss\nof them appears morbid ; on the contrary, the spirit\ncomplexes ought to be separate from the ego. Their\nassociation v\/ith it means illness, and their dissociation\nfrom it means healing. Thus primitive pathology knows\ntwo causes of illness, namely, the loss of a soul and the\npossession by a spirit. According to these primitive beliefs\nwe may postulate the existence of certain unconscious\ncomplexes which normally belong to the ego, and certain\nothers which normally do not belong to it, i.e. which ought\nto remain wholly unconscious. The former are the soul\ncomplexes, the latter the spirit complexes.\nThis discrimination, current among primitives, corre-\nsponds exactly to my theory of the unconscious. Ac-\ncording to my view, the unconscious is divided into two\nspheres. One of these is what I call the personal un-\nconscious. It includes all those psychic contents which\nare forgotten during the course of life. Their traces\nstill exist in the unconscious, even if their conscious\nreproduction has become impossible. Moreover, the\npersonal unconscious contains all those subliminal im-\npressions or perceptions which have too little energy to\nreach consciousness. The unconscious combinations of\nrepresentations belong thereto, in so far as they are too\nfeeble and indistinct to become conscious. Finally, the\npersonal unconscious includes all psychic contents which\nare incompatible with the conscious attitude. As a rule\nthis involves a whole group of psychic contents. These\ncontents appear to be inadmissible above all on account of\ntheir moral, aesthetic, or intellectual deficiency. A man\ncannot always feel and think in a beautiful, good and\ntrue way, and in trying to keep up an ideal attitude\neverything inconvenient is automatically repressed. If\n\fLxxix.] Psychological Foundations of Belief in Spirits. 85\none function, for instance thought, is especially developed\nand is dominating the conscious, then the function of\nfeeling is naturally repressed and falls therefore into the\nunconscious.\nThe other part of the unconscious is the super-personal\nor collective unconscious. The contents of the collective\nunconscious are not personal but collective ;\ni.e., they do\nnot appertain to one individual only, but at least to a group\nof individuals and as a rule to a whole nation, and\nfinally to the whole of mankind. The contents of the\ncollective unconscious are not acquired during an\nindividual's life, but are congenital instincts and\nprimordial forms of apprehension, the so-called archetypes\nor ideas. Although the child possesses no congenital\nrepresentations, it yet possesses a highly developed brain\nwith possibilities of functioning in a definite way. The\nbrain is an ancestral inheritance. It is the organic result\nof the psychic and nervous function of the whole ancestry\nof man. Thus the child brings into life with him an\norgan read}^ to function in the same way that it has\nfunctioned through all previous ages. There in the brain\nare the pre-formed instincts and also the primordial\ntypes or images, the foundations upon which mankind has\nalways formed his thought and feeling, which includes the\nwhole wealth of mythological motives. It is, of course,\nnot easy to prove the existence in a normal man of the\ncollective unconscious, but there are obvious traces of\nmythological images, at least in his dreams. The existence\nof a collective unconscious is more easily disclosed in\ncertain cases of mental derangement, especially in Dementia\npraecox. There one sometimes meets with an astonishing-\ndevelopment of mythological imagery. Certain patients\ndevelop symbolic ideas which can never be accounted\nfor by the experience of their individual life, but only\nby the history of the human mind. What is displayed\nis a sort of primitive mythological thinking producing its\nown primordial forms unlike normal thinking, which\nmakes use of personal experience.\nThe personal unconscious contains complexes belonging\nto the individual which form an indispensable part of\n\f86 C. G. Jung, M.D., LL.D. [part\nbis ps3^chic life. When any complexes which ought to\nbe associated with the ego become unconscious, either by\nrepression, or by decrease of their potentiality, the indi-\nvidual has a feeling of loss ; when a lost complex again\nbecomes conscious, for instance by psychotherapeutic meas-\nures, he experiences an increase of psychic energy. The\ncure of neurosis is often effected in this way.\nWhen, on the contrary, a complex of the collective\nunconscious associates itself with the ego, the individual\nis impressed by the strangeness of these contents. They\nare felt to be uncanny, supernatural and often dangerous.\nThey may sometimes be felt as helpful interventions of\nsupernatural powers, but more often as injurious influences\nof a morbid nature, and these result in actvial physical\nillness, or psychic alienation from normal life. An\nindividual's consciousness is always altered by the associa-\ntion of contents which ought normally to remain unconsci-\nous. If the physician succeeds in removing such a\nmorbid association from consciousness, the patient feels\nas if relieved from a burden. The sudden intrusion of\nsuch strange contents often takes place in the early\nstages of Dementia praecox. Patients encounter queer\nthoughts, the world seems changed, people appear to have\nstrange and distorted faces, etc.\nWhile the contents of the personal unconscious are felt\nto belong to one's own psyche, the contents of the collec-\ntive unconscious appear to be strange to one's own\npsyche, as if they came from outside. The reintegration\nof a personal complex has the effect of relieving and often\nof healing ; whereas the intrusion of a complex of the\ncollective unconscious is a disagreeable and even dangerous\nphenomenon. It appears to have a supernatural quality ;\nin other words, it is accompanied by a feeling of awe.\nThe parallelism of this theory with the primitive belief\nin souls and spirits is clear. Souls correspond to the\ncomplexes of the personal unconscious, and spirits to those\nof the collective unconscious. The scientific standpoint\ngives the prose of the matter when it calls the awful\nand revered beings that inhabit the shadows of the\nprimaeval forests \" psychological complexes.\" But if we\n\fLxxix.] Psychological Foimdations of Belief in Spirits. 87\nconsider the extraordinary role played by belief in souls\nand spirits in the history of mankind, we cannot be\ncontent with the mere statement of the existence of such\ncomplexes; we must study the nature of these complexes\nfurther.\nThe existence of complexes is easily demonstrated by\nmeans of the association experiment. This experiment\nconsists in a very simple procedure: the experimenter\ncaUs out a word to the test-person and the test-person\nimmediately replies with the next association coming into\nhis mind. The reaction-time, i.e. the lapse of time be-\ntween the stimulus word and the reply, is measured by\na stop-watch. One would expect all simple words to be\nfollowed by an equally short reaction-time, and all difficult\nor rare words to cause a prolonged reaction-time. But\nas a matter of fact, the reaction-times differ far less on\nthis than on other accounts. Some very long reaction-\ntimes are unexpectedly produced by very simple stimulus\nwords, and in the same case there may be no delay m\nreplying to quite unusual stimulus words. Through\ncareful examination of the test-person's individual psy-\nchology, I discovered that a prolongation of the reaction-\ntime is usually due to interference by a feehng associated\nwith the stimulus word or with the reply. The feehng\nitself always depends upon the fact that the stimulus\nword has struck a complex. Prolongation of the reaction-\ntime is not the only symptom that discloses the existence\nof a complex. There are many others which I cannot\nnow enumerate.\nThe complexes revealed by means of the association\nexperiment usually concern things which the test-person\nwould prefer to keep secret; often things of a painful\nnature, of whose very existence he is unconscious. When\na stimulus word strikes a complex, the test-person may\nhave no associations at all, or a super-abundant supply\nof them, so that choice is momentarily impossible. Hence\nwe see that disturbed reactions are indicated in many\nways other than by a prolongation of time. Moreover,\nif, having completed the series of tests, we ask the test-\nperson to repeat the answers he gave, we find that the\n\f88 C. G. Jung, M.D., LL.D. [part\nnormal reactions are remembered, while those connected\nwith the complex are easily forgotten.\nThe properties of the autonomous complex can be\nsummed up from these facts. The complex creates a\ndisturbance of mental reaction ; it delays or distorts the\nreply ;\nit produces an inconvenient reaction, or it sup-\n^)resses the memory of the former reply. It interferes\nwith the conscious and interrupts our intentions ; therefore\nwe call it autonomous. When we try the experiment on\na neurotic or insane person, we discover that the com-\nplexes disturbing the reactions belong in fact to the\nmain content of the psychic derangement. These com-\nplexes not only disturb the experimental reactions, but\nare also determinants of the morbid symptoms. I have\nexamined cases where the test-person replied to specific\nstimulus words with incoherent and apparently meaningless\nwords, breaking out against his conscious intention, as\nif a strange being had spoken through him. Such words\nbelong to the unconscious complex. Complexes when\nexcited by external stimuli can produce sudden confusion,\nor violent emotion, depression, anxiety-states and all\nsorts of mental disturbances. Complexes behave just\nlike independent beings, so that the primitive theory of\nspirits seems an excellent formulation for them.\nWe may carry this parallel further. Certain complexes\narise on account of painful experiences in a person's life,\ncausing psychic wounds which may not heal for years.\nIt often happens that a painful experience suppresses\ncertain vital qualities in an individual. Then a personal\nunconscious complex is originated. The primitive might\nappropriately regard it as the loss of a soul, for indeed\ncertain parts of the psyche have disappeared. A great\nnumber of complexes arise in such a way.\nBut there is another no less important source of com-\nplexes, and while the one just described is easily com-\nprehensible, since it concerns the conscious life, the other\nis obscure and difficult to understand, since it has to do\nwith perceptions and impressions of the collective uncon-\nscious. Usually the individual does not realize that such\nperceptions are derived from the unconscious ;\nrather.\n\fLxxix.] Psychological Foundations of Belief in Spirits. 89\nit seems to him as if they were due to external and\nconcrete facts. He thus rationahzes internal impressions\nof an unknown nature. But they are really irrational\nand ideal contents of his own mind, of which he was\nnever before conscious ;\nthey are not due to any of his\nexternal experiences. Primitive language expresses such\nfacts not inaptly when it describes them as invisible\nghosts approaching man from the other side, namelj^ from\nthe world of shadows. It seems to me that impressions of\nthis kind arise v\/hen grave external occurrences shake\nthe individual to his very foundations, so that his whole\nprevious attitude breaks down, or when certain contents\nof the collective unconscious obtain such an access of\nenergy that they are able to influence the conscious.\nThis may also take place when the life of a nation or\nof a large group of human society undergoes a profound\nchange of a political, social or religious nature. Such a\nchange involves a transformation of the psychological\nattitude. Changes in history are generally attributed to\nexternal causes. But I hold the view that the greatest\ncha^nges in human history are to be traced back to internal\ncausal conditions, and that they are founded upon internal\npsychological necessity. For it often seems that external\nconditions serve as mere occasions on which a new attitude\nlong in preparation becomes manifest. The development\nof the Christian era is an example of this. Political,\nsocial, and religious conditions influence the unconscious^\nsince all the factors which are suppressed in the conscious\nreligious or philosophical attitude of human society\naccumulate in the unconscious. This gradual accumulation\nmeans a gradual increase of the energy of the unconscious\ncontents. Certain individuals gifted with particularly\nrefined intuition become aware of the change going on in\nthe collective unconscious and sometimes even succeed in\ntranslating their perceptions of it into communicable\nideas. The new ideas spread more or less rapidly in\nproportion to the preparedness and readiness in the\nunconscious of other people. In proportion to the more\nor less universal unconscious preparation people are ready\nto accept new ideas, or else to show particular resistance\n\f^\ni\n90 C. G. Jung, M.D., LL.D. [part i\nto them. New ideas are not only the enemies of old ]\nones, but they also often appear in an extremely un- j\ni\nacceptable form.\nWhenever any contents of the collective unconscious\nbecome animated, the conscious feels disturbed, more often,\nit appears, in a disagreeable than in an agreealjle way.\nThis may be due to the fact that disagreeable experiences\nalways make a greater impression than agreeable ones.\nIn any case animation of the collective unconscious\ncreates a certain confusion in the conscious. If this\nanimation is due to a complete breakdown of all conscious !\nhopes and expectations, the danger arises that the un-\nconscious may take the place of conscious reality. Such\na state is morbid. We actually see something of this\nkind in the present Russian and German mentality. An\noutbreak of violent desires and impossible phantasies\namong the lower strata of the population is analogous to\nan outburst from the lower strata of the unconscious in\nan individual. In the case of Russia and Germany what '\nwe see is the visible and concrete collapse of two great\nnations.\nBut animation of the unconscious may begin from\nwithin, in the absence of a definite external catastrophe.\n|\nIn such a case it is due to the gradual development of a i\nnew psychological attitude in the depths of a nation's\nj\nmentality. Thus, in an epoch of worldliness and material-\nism an idealistic attitude maj' slowly develop in the ,\nunconscious. For example, the evolution of Christianity I\nwas not due to the collapse of the Roman empire. It\norigiiiated at the time of the Pax Romana, during the\nepoch of the Empire's greatest splendour and power. |\nSuch a new era is conditioned by developments that are\ntaking place practically in everybody, that is, by a\nprocess in the collective unconscious. In everybody\nat such a time, unconscious energy disturbs the conscious,\nbut the individual in such a case does not consider\n'\nhimself ill, because he is not different from his fellow ,i\nbeings. He simply takes part in a collective trans-\nformation, whose origins and aims remain unconscious.\nThe individual may be unhappy and distressed, and |\n\fLxxix.] Psychological Foundations of Belief in Spirits. 91\nprobably has genuine reasons for his sadness, for social\nand political conditions will suffer greatly from the funda-\nmental changes going on. He will not, however, have\nthe typically morbid feeling of one whose unconscious\nbecomes disturbed on accovint of painful experiences of an\nindividual nature.\nThe animation of the collective unconscious does not\nalways create disturbances, for it may also work bene-\nficially, but it always carries with it something of a\nsupernatural character. Owing to this the effect of the\ncollective unconscious is always beyon-d the grasp of\nman. At one time it helps, at another time it destroys\nhim. It is never to be relied upon. Therefore primitive\nman is especially subject to the fetters of the unconscious.\nYet among primitive civilizations we already find attempts\nto conjure the supernatural power and influences of the\nunconscious. Amongst primitives there are peculiarly\nintuitive individuals, sometimes of superior intelligence,\nnamely, sorcerers. They are supposed to know how to\nhandle demons. In history the primitive tribal sorcerer\nis the man who originates psychological methods and\nteachings which aim at domination of the supernatural.\nThe rites and legends he invents represent qualities of\nthe unconscious as he conceives of them. Thus he trans-\nlates some inner experiences into human language and\ncreates the foundations of the history of the human mind.\nOur intellect is born from mythology, and mythology is\nnothing but a translation of inner experience into the\nlanguage of pictures. Thus spirits are transformed into\nmind.\nA weU-known instance of the spirit translated into\nlanguage and teaching is the miracle of Pentecost. To\nthe Gentiles the apostles seemed in a state of mental\nconfusion, because they were under the influence of the\nspirit, viz. a phenomenon of the coflective unconscious.\nBut from this state they derived the words, the images\nand the power to teach the world. Through the transla-\ntion of unconscious contents into comprehensible language,\nthe power of the spirit, in other words, the energy of\nthe unconscious complex, becomes transformed into a\n\f92 1^ C. G. Jung, M.D., LL.D. [part\npowerful idea, which enables the human mind to free\nitself from the fetters of demoniacal influences.\nAs souls are parts of the individual psyche, so spirits\nare parts of the collective psyche. Souls are complexes\nsplit off from and lost to the conscious ;\nspirits are com-\nplexes of the collective unconscious, which replace a lost\nadaptation to reality, or which compensate for the\ninadequacies of large groups of men.\nWhat are regarded as spirits of the dead are psycho-\nlogically created in the following way : When an individual\ndies, the psychological attachment of his relatives' feehngs\nis cut off. The attachment represents the application of\na certain quantity of psychic energy. When the applica-\ntion of this energy becomes impossible, through the death\nof its object, there only remains the idea or image of\nthe dead. The energy is now applied to this image, and\nwhen the attachment has been intense, the image remains\nalive and forms a spirit. As the spirit takes away a\ncertain amount of energy from real life, he may be\ninjurious. Primitives, therefore, frequently say that when\na man dies he changes his character in an unfavourable\nway and seeks to do as much damage as he can to the\nliving. Obviously this opinion originates in the fact that\na persistent attachment to a dead person makes life seem\nless worth living, consequently less worthy of effort.\nI have given you an outline of a conception of the\nspirit problem from the viewpoint of modern psychology.\nI have confined myself to the limits of science and have\npurposely avoided the question whether spirits are real\nor concrete objects, and whether their independent exist-\nence can be proved concretely. I avoid this question\nnot because I regard it as futile, but because I am not\ncompetent to discuss it from a scientific standpoint,\nhaving no evidence in my possession. I think you are\nas conscious as I am of the fact that it is most difficult\nto find reliable evidence for the independent and objective\nreality of a spirit. The usual spiritistic proofs offered\nare as a rule nothing but psychological products, depend-\nent upon the unconscious of the percipient. Even the\n\fLxxix.] Psychological Foundations of Belief in Spirits.\nso-called physical efiects always depend upon the co-\noperation of the percipient and seem to be exteriorized\neffects of unconscious complexes. I am personally con-\nvinced of the reality of such facts, but I cannot accept\nthem as evidence for the independent reality of spirits.\nThese phenomena form a special chapter in psychology.\nScience must, I think, confine itseK to the limits of\ncognition, for science is essentially intellect ;\nit means\nthe application of one undoubted psychological function,\nnamely, thought. But intellect is only one among several\npsychological functions, and therefore does not suffice\nto give a complete picture of the world. Feeling, for\ninstance, which is another psychological function, some-\ntimes arrives at different convictions from those of\nintellect, and we cannot always prove that the convictions\nof feeling are necessarily inferior to those of the intellect.\nWe have also subhminal perceptions, which are not at\nthe disposal of the intellect, and which, therefore, are\nmissing in a merely intellectual picture of the world.\nSo we must admit that our intellectual conceptions are\ndeficient so far as a complete comprehension of the world\nis concerned. But when we make use of intellect, as\nis the case in science, we have to adapt ourselves to the\ndemands of intellectual criticism, and we must limit\nourselves to the scientific hypothesis so long as there is\nno reliable evidence against its validity.\n\f94 T.

(Balliere,\nTindall & Cox.)\nThis book, as its title-page indicates, is a revised and enlarged\nedition of Dr. Ernest Jones' Papers on Psycho-Analysis, first\npublished in 1912. On its first appearance it consisted of\nt-\\\\ enty chapters ; in the new edition one of these has been\nomitted and twenty-one new ones have been added ; thus the\nnew edition is, roughly, twice the size of the old one. It is\nwritten in exposition of the ^^\u2022orks of Professor Freud, to whom\nit is dedicated as a token of the author's gratitude.\nThe pajoers are grouped under five headings as follows :\nGeneral Papers, Papers on Dreams, Papers on Treatment,\nClmical Papers, Papers on Education and Child Study. In\neach of these groups some papers are more technical than\nothers, and some readers may -with advantage study them in\na slightly different order from that in which they are arranged.\nIt would, for example, be helpful to those who are new to\nthe subject if they passed from the General Papers to the two\nchapters which deal with the miconscious mental life of the\nchild, before going on to the more technical expositions con-\ntained in other parts of the book. For nothing is more\nconducive to a true appreciation of the meaning and signifi-\ncance of Freudian teaching than a clear understanding, from\nthe beginning, of what is implied by the term '\nThe Uncon-\nscious '\n; and in no part of his work does Dr. Jones explain\nthis more lucidly than in these two papers. The short but\nvaluable paper on The Unconscious and its significance for\n\fLXXIX. Review. 95\nPsychopathology will be more fully appreciated if it is read in\nconjunction with the two papers on the unconscious mind of\nthe child.\nDr. Jones refers to three principal current uses of the word\n'\nunconscious,' two of which he summarilj^ dismisses in favour\nof the Freudian conception. The fii'st of these is where\n'\nimconseious '\nis regarded as a sjoionym for '\nnon-mental.'\nThis attitude, he points out, begs the ^hole question, by\nassuming that no mental processes can exist that are not\naccompanied by consciousness or a\\\\areness. When used in\nthis sense the word has no place in psychological discussion,\nfor psychology is concerned v,ith. mental states and processes.\nThere is less justification for Dr. Jones' somewhat scornful\nrejection of the second conception of the unconscious which\nhe associates with the names of Hartmann, F. W. H. Myers\nand Jung. This may seem an odd assortment of names\nto bring together as supi^orting any particular vie\\v of the\nunconscious, but Dr. Jones finds something common to the\nviews of these three writers which leads him to do so. Thej^\nuphold Avhat, he says, may be called the '\nlimbo '\nconception,\n\" for in it the unconscious is regarded as an obscure region\nof the mind, the content of w^hich is largely characterized by\nneglect and oblivion.\" We are reminded here of what Myers\nsaid about the subliminal\u2014that it is part lumber room and\npart treasvu-e house. Dr. Jones has apparently little faith in\nthe existence of the lumber room and he is frankly shocked at\nthe possibility of the treasure house. He regards it as curious\nthat writers viho support the Umbo conception should believe\nin the co-existence in the unconscious of two groups of ideas\nwhich do not seem to have any genetic relation to one another.\nThe third conception of the unconscious is the psycho-\nanaljiiic one developed by Freud. This conception. Dr.\nJones says, differs sharply from the other two in that it is\n\" a purely inductive one, being built up step by step on the\nbasis of actual experience without the introduction of any a\npriori speculative hypothesis.\" But the -writers whom Dr. Jones\nassociates with the '\nlimbo '\nconception would also, no doubt,\nclaim that their conceptions ere arrived at in a similar \\ya.y ;\nand even Hartmann might have denied that his h\\'pothesis\nwas a priori. Myers, most assuredly, regarded his conception\n\f96 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nof the subliminal as \" a purely inductive one built up step by\nstep on the basis of actual experience \"\n; and Jung declares\nthat he felt forced to abandon the Freudian conception off\nthe unconscious just because of his actual experience in psycho-\nanalysis. The hypotheses introduced by Myers and by Jung\nare m no sense a priori, but are legitimate hjrpotheses put\nforward to subsume the facts observed by them in their\nrespective fields of investigation ; and the true ground of\ncriticism of their conceptions must be sought in questioning\nthe actuality of their alleged facts, rather than in denying the\nlegitimacy of the hypotheses which, they employ.\nIt is noteworthy, in this connexion, that the first statement\nmade by Dr. Jones regardmg the Freudian unconscious,\u2014the\none on which he lays the greatest stress and the one he con-\nsiders of most fundamental importance,\u2014is not a statement\nof observed fact but an hypothesis. This statement is to\nthe effect that the existence of the unconscious is the result of\nrepression. But the fact observed in the process of psycho-\nanalysis is not '\nrepression '\nbut '\nresistance.' It was from his\nexperience of resistance to the emergence of pathogenic memories\nthat Freud got the idea of repression. He thought the\nforce which caused the resistance in psycho-analysis must\nbe the force which origmally caused the forgetting.\" Thus he\ncame to formulate his hypothesis of repression; and so well\ndid it serve his purpose, so fruitful did it become in account-\ning for the nature of the imconscious contents revealed by\npsycho-analysis, so wide ^\\ as the field of investigation in which\nit seemed to be applicable, that this hypothesis has become\nthe corner stone of psycho-analytic theory.\nThe other attributes of the unconscious enumerated by\nDr. Jones are more strictly facts of observation. These are\n(1) its dynamical nature, (2) its relation to the primary\ninstincts, (3) its infantile nature and origin, (4) its illogical\ncharacter, and (5) its predominantly sexual character. These\nattributes are summarized in the statement that \" the uncon-\nscious is a region of the mind, the content of which is\ncharacterized by the attributes of being repressed, conative,\ninstinctive, infantile, imreasoning and predominantly sexual.\"\nThe Repression Theory in its relation to memory is dealt\nwith at length in Chapter V. This paper was read before the\n\fLXXIX. Review. 97\nBritish Psychological Society in 1915, and was in a sense a\ncontinuation of a discussion which took place at a meeting of\nthat Societ}^ in the previous year. Consequently a considerable\npart of this paper is devoted to a criticism of the views of\nthose who took part in that discussion. Some of these views\nwere put forward so tentatively that they hardly merit Dr.\nJones' attention in a work of this kind.\nOf the five chapters on Dreams only one is entirely new,\n\u2014\na short paper on dream manipulation of numbers ; but some\nalterations have been made in the older papers and some new\nmatter has been added. The paper on Freud's Theory of\nDreams has long been recognized as one of the best short\nexpositions of this subject, and the value which it had in its\noriginal form is enhanced by the additions made to it in the\npresent volume.\nSome of these are perhaps a result of the criticisms to\nwhich the Freudian theory of dreams has been subjected\nduring the past few years, especially by the Zurich School.\nAlthough Dr. Jones remains a staunch upholder of pure\nFreudian doctrine, some traces of concession to the contentions\nof his critics, or, at least, some change of emphasis in the\npresentation of his own views, may, here and there, be detected\nThus, for example, in speaking of the distortion of the true\ndream thoughts in the dream as related by the dreamer he\nsays :\n\" The core of Freud's theory, and the most original\npart of his contribution to the subject, resides in his tracing\nthe cause of this distortion mainly to a '\ncensor ' which\ninterposes an obstruction to the becoming conscious of un-\nconscious psychical processes.\" In the first edition this sen-\ntence did not contain the word '\nmainly '\n; the distortion was\nascribed to the censor without qualification.\nThe Freiidian '\ncensor ' has been a favourite theme of the\ncritics, and too much stress has perhaps been laid on the objec-\ntion to the anthropomorphic character which this hypothesis has\nassumed. For if any force ^dthin the personality does perform\nthe work which is attributed to the censor, it is convenient and\nlegitimate to refer to it by this name. If criticism is directed\nagainst this conception it should take the form of questioning\nwhether there is any such force at work and whether it does\nproduce the effects which are claimed to be due to its action.\n\f98 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nOne of these effects, in which the activity of the censor\nwas given predominant if not exclusive importance, is the\n'\ndistortion '\nin dreams. In a new paragraph in his papef on\nFreud's Theory of Dreams Dr. Jones refers in more detail to\nwhat he probably had in miad when he introduced the word\n'\nmainly '\nin the sentence quoted above. In addition to the\naction of the endo-psychic dream censor in causing the trans-\nformation of the latent into the manifest content of the dream,\nhe refers to two other factors which are also at work One\nof these is the '\nregression '\nby which the ideational material of\nthe dream is presented to consciousness in the form of 'Hhe\nraw material of its sensorial imagery.\" The other important\nfactor leading to distortion is the process of symbolism.\nThe occurrence of regression and of symbolism in the forma-\ntion of dreams has, of course, been insisted on from the\nbeginning in Freud's theory of dreams, and that they formed\npart of the mechanism of distortion was generally accepted ;\nbut it did not appear that they were to be regarded as factors\nof distortion separate from, and irrespective of, the activity\nof the censor. Regression was ascribed, partly at least, to the\nresistance of the censor ; and the adoption by the dream of\nthe language of symbolism was regarded as a compulsion\nenforced in the same way.\nThe relation of the dream censor to the dream symbolism\nis still not quite clear. In his latest contribution to the\nsubject in Chapter VII. (the Theory of Symbolism) Dr. Jones\ntells us that \" Symbolism arises as the result of intra-psychical\nconflict between the repressing tendencies and the repressed \"\n;\nand, again, that \" the symbol is a substitute for the primary\nidea, compulsorUy formed as a compromise between the\ntendency of the unconscious complex and the inhibiting factors.\"\nNo distinction seems to be drawn between the endo-psychic\ndream censor and the '\nrepressing tendencies,' or the '\ninhibiting\nfactors,' concerned in symbol formation, and in so far as the\ncensor and the repressing tendencies signify the same thing,\nthere would seem to be no reason for regarding the process\nof symbolism as a factor of dream distortion distinct from\nthe action of the endo-psychic dream censor.\nBut the process of symbolism is \" one that seems to be\nbound up with the very nature of the unconscious mind\n\fLXXIX.] Review. 99\nitself and undoubtedly related to its ontogenetic and phylo-\ngenetic history.\" This reminds us of Jung's teaching, that\nthinkmg in symbols is the only mode of thinking open to\nthe imconscious ; and if this be so, the emergence of uncon-\nscious thoughts in dream is independent of the activity of\nthe di'eam censor, for they are already sufficiently distorted\nto evade his vigilance. There would at least seem to be a\ndifference between unconscious thoughts gaining admission to\nconsciousness owing to the fact that they are already suffi-\nciently distorted to evade the censor, and the admission of\nthoughts only after they have been compelled by the censor\nto undergo distortion through condensation and displacement\nor regression towards sensorial imagery.\nIn Chapter VII. the Theory of Symbolism is dealt with at\nconsiderable length, and an effort is made to bring order into\na region where hitherto there has been much confusion. It is\na valuable contribution to a subject of fimdamental importance,\nand may with confidence be regarded as an authoritative\nexegesis of Freudian doctrine on this topic.\nDr. Jones passes in review the many ap])lications of the\nwords '\nsymbol '\nand '\nsymbolism,' and desires to restrict\nwhat he regards as true symbolism to that mode of indirect\nrepresentation which fulfils the demands of Freudian theory.\nHe maintains the thesis that true symbolism, in the strict\nsense, is to be distinguished from other forms of indirect\nrepresentation. Besides certain attributes which would be\ngenerally conceded as appertaining to ideas and acts denoted\nby the words '\nsymbol '\nor '\nsymbolic,' true symbolism, in the\nFreudian use of the word, possesses, in addition, a number of\nother attributes which distinguish it from the rest of the group.\nThe most important of these is the peculiarity that the\nsymbol always represents unconscious material. By this is\nmeant, not so much that the concepts symbolized are not\nknown to the individual, as that the effect investing the\nconcept is in a state of repression and, therefore, vmconscious.\nAlso the process of symbolization is carried out unconsciously.\nThe comparison between the idea symbolized and the symbol\nhas, as a rule, not been present to consciousness at all.\nAnother feature of the true symbol is its almost constant\nmeaning. The possible variation in meaning is exceedingly\n\f100 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [paet I\nrestricted. Further, the use of a symbol is not dependent\non individual factors only, more important determining factors\nbeing those that are common to large classes of men, or,\nmore often, to mankind as a whole. An individual carmot\ngive a regular symbol a different meaning from anyone else.\nHe can merely choose his symbols or make new ones.\nOther characteristics of the true symbol are its evolutionary\nbasis and the linguistic connections that may be traced between\nthe \\\\'ord denoting the symbol and the idea symbolized. One\nof the most striking features of true symbolism is the remark- \\\nable ubiquity of the same symbols among different races and j\nat different epochs of the world's history, and in many different i\nfields of thought, such as dreams, wit, insanity and poetry. i\nThe conception of symbolism thus formulated admits of j\ncertain statements being made which would not apply if the j\nnature of the process of symbolism were less restricted. Thus \u2022\nit is said that \" all symbols represent ideas of the self and i\nthe immediate blood relations, or of the phenomena of birth,\nlove and death.\" They represent the most primitive ideas |\nand interests imaginable. These ideas represent the most\nj\nrepressed part of the mind, and \" only what is repressed is |\nsymbolized ;\nonly what is repressed needs to be symbolized.\nThis conclusion is the touchstone of the psycho-analytic j\ntheory of symbolism.\" j\nIt is necessary to bear in mind this precise use of the word i\n'\nsymbol ' in Freudian writings, for there are many authors '\nof repute, both in psychopathology and in other fields of j\ninvestigation, who habitually use this term in a much wider j\nsense. Dr. Jones deals with this matter at some length in |\nan examination of the views of what he calls the post-psycho- |\nanalytic school, represented by Adier, Jung, Maeder, Silberer, |\nStekel, with then- English followers, Eder, Long, and NicoU. \\\nHe regards Silberer as the only member of this school who |\nhas made a positive contribution to the theory of symbolism, |\nand he gives a critical abstract of the work of this writer. I\nOne important point of dispute between the two schools\nis the relation of the symbol, in \"the mythological stage of I\nknowledge,\" to the idea, the higher form of truth, that will \\\nlater replace it. Is the later, more objective form of know- !\nledge already implicit in the symbol ? Has the symbol a i\n\fLXXIX.] Review. 101\nmeaning for the future ? Silberer does not definitely answer\nthis question, but Dr. Jones thinks that Jung would unhesi-\ntatingly answer it in the affirmative in all cases. Dr. Jones,\nhimself, expresses an opinion directly opposed to Jung's teach-\ning.\n\" I do not think,\" he says, \" that the future idea is\nimplicit in the symbol ; on the contrary, the existence of the\nsymbol\u2014to be more accurate, the symbolic use of the symbol\n\u2014\nis often the very thmg that is preventing the idea from\nbeing formulated.\"\nClosely related to what Jung understands by the prospective\nmeaning of symbolism is that aspect which Silberer refers to\nas its anagogic significance. By this is meant \" the mystical,\nhermetic, or religious doctrme that is supposed to be con-\ntained in the symbol. The symbol is taken to be the expres-\nsion of a strivmg for a high ethical ideal, one which fails to\nreach this ideal and halts at the symbol instead ;\nthe ultimate\nideal, however, is supposed to be implicit in the symbol,\nand to be symbolized by it.\" Jung claims that the recogni-\ntion of the intrinsic value of a symbol leads us to constructive\ntruth and helps us to live.\nAt this point in his examination of the views of Silberer\nand Jung, Dr. Jones abandons criticism. He says :\n\" Along\nthis path the post-psycho-analytic school loses itself in a\nperfect maze of mysticism, occultism, and theosophy, into\nwhich I do not propose to penetrate ; Silberer implicitly,\nand Jung explicitly, abandon the methods and canons of\nscience, particularly the conceptions of causality and deter-\nminism, so that I may consider myself absolved from the\ntask of attempting to unravel the assumptions that have\nculminated in their latest views. As the philosophers would\nsay, it is impossible for us to adhere to one universe of\ndiscourse.\"\nBut the universe of discourse may always be sufficiently\none so long as the problem to be solved is one, and the\npossibility of the futm-e idea being implicit in the symbol is\npart of the general problem of purposes and ends. Adherence\nto a scientific dogma is no vu-tue if the dogma is not relevant\nto the facts to be explained ;\nand, to many, the dogma of\nmechanistic determinism seems irrelevant to the facts of\nman's pm'posive life. If striving for a high ethical ideal be\n\f102 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\na real factor in the determination of thought and conduct,\nand if the ultimate ideal be implicit in tlie symbol, a purely\nmechanistic psychology will never discover it.\nAnother important matter on which Dr. Jones differs from\nsome members of the post-psycho-analytic school is in the\nexplanation he gives of the miiformity and ubiquity of what\nmay be called anthropological symbols. These symbols recur\nin folk-lore, mjrthology, and dreams, at all times and in all\nplaces, and some writers, notably Jimg, maintain that this\ncan be accounted for only by supposing that these symbols\nare inherited as such and form part of the innate endowment\nof the mind. Dr. Jones holds the view that the individual\nchild re-creates such symbolism anew and that \" the stereo-\ntypy is due to the uniformity of the human mind in regard\nto the particular tendencies that furnish the source of symbol-\nism,\n\u2014\ni.e. to the uniformity of the fundamental and perennial\ninterests of mankind.\"\nIt would be out of place here to discuss in any detail the\nmore purely medical papers which form the larger part of\nthis volume. There are two new chapters on treatment and\neight new clinical papers, all of ^hich are of great value and\ninterest to the psychopathologist.

I had never had the watch out of its\ncase before ;\nbeing, indeed, careful neither to finger it myself nor\nto let anyone else finger it.\nI recall this because recently, during the British Association\nMeeting at Bournemouth in September, 1919, a cousui of\nmine whom I had never previously seen, and who has been\nmost of his life m South America, introduced himself to me\nand related many reminiscences of our joint uncles, in days\npartly concurrent with and partly preceding the period during\nwhich I knew them. This cousm is Mr. Frederick L. Lodge,\nwho had corresponded with me about an experience of his\nwife's, the uicident beuig related by me m my book. The\nSurvival of Man, page 74. I had no further communication\nwith Mr. F. L. Lodge, except those specified in the book, and\nI had not realised exactly who he was. I found at Bourne-\nmouth, however, for the first time that he was a son of one\nof my uncles, and that he had been born in 1846, so that\nhis memories date back earher than my own. Among many\nrecollections of his father and my other senior uncles, who\nwere considerably older than my own father, he told me\nstories of Uncle Jerry and his blindness, one of which I asked\n\f104 Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S. [part lxxix.\nhim to put into writing. This morning, September I6th, 1919,\naccordingly, he sends me the following :\nWhen Uncle Jerry was staying at Grafrath in Germany, consiilting\nan oculist (he was then totally blind), I used to accompany him in his\ndaily walks, and on one occasion as we were sitting by the road-side\nhe had his gold repeater watch in his hand and was whittling away\nat it with his penknife. I asked him what he was doing, and he replied\nthat he was marking it, so as to know it by the touch ; I believe it\nwas on the shank near the ring, whether he succeeded in making a\nmark I do not remember. At the time of your seance with Mrs. Piper\nthe watch was in the possession of his brother Robert at Highgate,\nbut I believe no mark could be discovered then.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nPART LXXX.\nNovember, 1920.\nI.\nPRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.\nDelivered at a General Meeting of the Society on July 19,\n1920.\nBy William McDougall, M.B., F.R.S.\nI WILL Dot attempt to express my sense of the great\nhonour you have done me in electing me to the presi-\ndency of this Society. That sense is much accentuated\nby the fact that my predecessor in this chair, whose\nloss we all deplore, was so great a man ; a man of science\nso great that his name will remain among those few\nwhich the English people will ever cherish with pride\nand gratitude. Our Society was fortunate indeed in\nbeing able for many years to claim him as a member,\nand stiU more fortunate in that he consented to occupy\nthis chair before he was called away.\nIn looking with mingled pride and humihty at the\nlist of former Presidents of the Society, I cannot avoid\nremarking that one only of them was primarily and\nprofessedly a psychologist. I mean of course William\nJames, the man who more than all others has been for\nme the shining leader, the perfect exponent of scientific\ncandour and courage.\n\f106 William. McDougall, M.B., F.R.S. [part\nI notice also that but few other names of professed\npsychologists appear on our roll of membership.\nI am moved by these facts to offer some slight apology\nand explanation on behalf of my professional colleagues ;\nfor surely they, bej-ond all other men of science, should\nhave felt the call to support, if only by passive member-\nship, the work and reputation of this Society. They,\nby special knowledge and training, are or should be better\nequipped than any others to evaluate the work of the\nSociety, to criticise it, or, better still, actively to co-\noperate in it. The fact that the great majority of them\nstand aloof requires some consideration ; for it is capable\nof being, and in some quarters has been, interpreted in\na sense detrimental to our work. It may be said\n\u2014\nhere is a body of men on whose judgment the public\nmay best rely in forming its opinion about Psychical\nResearch, and that judgment seems to be adverse ; for\nthe bulk of them do not support the work, even to the\nsmall extent of joining the Society. This conclusion\nwould, I think, be false. The explanation of the fact\nis in the main to be found in a different direction.\nAn open mind towards the phenomena which the\nSociety investigates is far commoner, I am sure, among\nmen of science, than appears to the general public. This\nopinion, which I venture to express in this highly re-\nsponsible position, is founded not only upon my personal\ncontacts with men of science, but also upon the fact\nthat only one scientific creed logically permits the de-\nduction that these alleged phenomena do not and cannot\noccur. That creed is dogmatic materialism : and although\nthat creed can still claim a few confident exponents, it\nis distinctly out of fashion at the present time. How-\never materialistic may be the dominant habit of thought\namong men of science, there are but few of them who\nwill confess to a whole-hearted acceptance of materialism\nas a philosophic creed. The bulk of them are sufficiently\nwell educated to know that as such it is untenable ;\nand also to know that from it alone can they logically\ndeduce the impossibility of the alleged phenomena. The\ngrounds of the aloofness of so many men of science from\n\fLXXX.] Presidential Address. 107\nthe work of our Society, in spite of their minds being\nmore or less open to conviction in its sphere, are many\nI\nand complex. It would perhaps not be altogether un-\nI\nprofitable to attempt to describe and examine them.\nI But for my present purpose I wish to point out one\nj\nonly of them, one by no means discreditable to those\n[\nwho are influenced by it. I mean a sense of responsi-\nbiUty towards .\nthe public. Men of science are afraid\nlest, if they give an inch in this matter, the pubhc will\ntake an ell and more. They are afraid that the least\ndisplay of interest or acquiescence on their part may\npromote a great outburst of superstition on the part of\nthe public, a relapse into behef in witchcraft, necromancy,\nand the black arts generally, with all the moral evils\nwhich must accompany the prevalence of such beliefs.\nFor they know that it is only through the faithful work\nof men of science during very recent centuries that\nthese debasing behefs have been in large measure banished\nfrom a small part of the world ;\nthey know that, through-\nout the rest of the world, these superstitions continue\nto flourish, ready at any moment to invade and over-\nwhelm those small areas of enlightenment. They know\nthat such overwhelming of those areas must plunge\ntheir populations back among the grovelling fears and\nthe cruel and hateful practices which have been the\nscourge and torment of mankind since that remote\nage when the race became endowed with the two-\nedged and dangerous weapon of imagination. Now\nthe psychologists, just because they of all men must be\nregarded as best equipped to judge of these difficult\nmatters, feel this responsibility more acutely than any\nother class of scientific men. Further\u2014they feel a great\nresponsibility for the reputation of their own science\nand are afraid of doing it an injury. Any physicist,\nlike the great physicists who have adorned and strength-\nened this Society, may display an active interest in\nPsychical Research without the least risk of injury to\nthe reputation of his science. Physical science stands\nfirmly established in the esteem of all men ; for it is\nclear to all that it has provided the material basis of\n\f108 William McDougall, M.B., F.R.S. [part\nour civilisation. Psychology stands in a very different\nposition. It is only beginning to assert its position\namong the sciences ; the general public and even some of\nour universities still regard its claim to be a science,\nand a science of high practical value, with doubt and\nsuspicion. In face of this situation the academic psycho-\nlogist is rightly cautious. His attitude may, I think,\nbe succinctly and concretely expressed by saying that he\nis afraid of the left wing of our Society, and that, if\nthe Society consisted only of its right wing, he would\ncome in and co-operate cheerfully and profitably. But\nboth wings are necessary to our Society ; we cannot\nhope to fly to any good purpose on one alone. It has\nbeen the great virtue of our Society that, in spite of\ndifferences of opinion, sometimes acute, it has kept the\nallegiance of men and women of so widely different\nviews in respect to its problems. My own conviction\nis that the risk I have indicated must be run. I myself\nbelong very decidedly to the right wing ; but I recognise\nthe importance of the left ; I recognise also the right\nof its members to their opinions, and I esteem the\ndriving power and the freedom of speculation which\ncome from the left as essential to the success of our\nwork.\nThe importance of the work of our Society seems to\nme to justify the taking of some risk. But that work\ndoes not really add to the risk of relapse into barbaric\nsuperstition ; rather it is our best defence against it.\nFor Pandora's box has been opened, the lid has been\nslightly hfted, and we are bound to go on and to explore\nits remotest corner and cranny. It is not only or chiefly\nthe work of this Society that has raised the lid a little\nand exposed us to this danger. The culture of Europe\nhas for a brief period rested upon the twin supports\nof dogmatic affirmation and dogmatic denial, of orthodox\nreligion and scientific materialism. But both of these\nsupports are crumbling, both alike sapped by the tide\nof free enquiry. And it is the supreme need of our\ntime that these two pillars of dogmatism shall be replaced\nby a single solid column of knowledge on which our\n\fLXXX.] Presidential Address. 109\nculture may securely rest. It is the policy of sitting on\nthe lid of the box that is risky ; a danger and threat\nto our civilisation.\nI have said that I belong to the extreme right of our\nSociety, and I fear that I may shock and hurt some of\nour members of the left by the following remark, which\nnevertheless, I feel I am bound to make. It is conceiv-\nable to me that we may ultimately find the box to have\nbeen empty from the first, as empty as some of our\ndogmatic critics assert it to be. Even then I should\nmaintain that the work of our Society in boldly exploring\nits recesses and showing its emptiness to the world had\nbeen of the very greatest value. But I do not anticipate\nthis result, though I do not dread it. As regards our\npositive conclusions and their value I will say only this,\nI beheve that telepathy is very nearly established for\nan time among the facts recognised by Science, mainly\nby the work of this Society. If and when that result\nshall have been achieved, its importance for Science and\nPhilosophy will far outweigh the sum of the achievements\nof all the psychological laboratories of the universities\nof two continents.\nAs regards the other main hnes of enquiry of our\nSociety, I confidently hold that nothing hitherto estab-\nlished by Science or Philosophy can be shown to imply\nthat these enquiries must have a purely negative result.\nOur conclusions must be founded eventually upon just\nsuch collection and critical sifting of the empirical evidence\nas our Society has resolutely pursued for nearly forty\nyears. During these forty years a whole generation of\ndevoted workers has passed away. But what are forty\nyears in the great procession of knowledge ! Even though it\nwere clear that four hundred years will be needed for the\nattainment of definite conclusions, we ought not to shrink\nfrom the task, or falter by the way. The supreme importance\nof the problems before which we stand would justify an in-\ndefinitely great expenditure of time and energy upon them.\nFor the interests of our culture and civihsation demand\nthat the present chaos of conflicting opinions and pre-\njudices shall be replaced by clear and definite knowledge.\n\f110 William McDougall, M.B., F.R.8. [part\nAfter these few remarks in the nature of a confession |\nof my attitude towards our works, I propose to devote \\\nthe remainder of my time to formulating a speculative i\nsuggestion, which may have value as a working hypothesis\nfor some branches of our work. The suggestion is not\na new one ; what I have to say is merely an attempt to\ndevelop a little an old idea in the light of modern\nknowledge.^ Some years ago I published a book, Body\nand Mind, in which I maintained that, however we i\nconceive the body, we are compelled to conceive our \\\nconscious mental life as the activity of a unitary being\nendowed with the faculties of knowing, feeling and striv-\ning, the ego, soul, or self. It has been made a reproach\nto me that the long argument of that book came to an\nend just when it began to be really interesting. My\npresent purpose is to outline another step of the argu-\nment, to add one more chapter to the book. In the\nyears that have passed since its publication, I have been\nmuch concerned both practically and theoretically with\ncases of nervous disorder. Now these cases of functional\nnervous disorder have been widely held to make untenable\nthat conception of the unitary ego to which the argu-\nment of my book had pointed. In such cases we often\nseem to find evidences of the division of the self into two |\nor more parts, each of which seems to be endowed with\nthe fundamental faculties of mind, conscious knowing, j\nfeeling and striving, a striving that expresses itself in\npart in the control of bodily movements. To many\nthinkers the facts of this order seem to shew that the j\nstream of consciousness is, like any other stream, a\ncomposite structure, something that is composed of separ-\nable parts ;\nfor, they say, if it is capable of being broken\ninto parts, it must consist of such parts, and must be\nconceived as formed by the coming together of such parts,\nj\n1 It is the notion of '\nmonads '\nwhich came down to us from Leibnitz. !\nIn recent years it has been developed as the basis of a plurahstic ,\nmetaphysic by Prof. James Ward (in his Pluralism and Theism) and\nby his disciple Mr. C. A. Richardson (in his Spiritual Pluralism). R.\nH. Lotze may be claimed as its chief exponent in the nineteenth\ncentury : and Mr. Gerald Balfour (in his presidential address) has\nurged its claims upon the attention of this Society.\n\fLXXX.] Presidential Address. Ill\nThus they arrive at the notion of consciousness as a\nsort of stuff which may be variously combined, broken\nup and recombined, much as a stream of water or, let\nus say, of treacle, may be split into minor streams and\nrecombined. Some then speak of a cosmic reservoir of\nthis stuff, some of which is somehow filtered through a\nscreen in tiny trickling streams to form the conscious-\nness of you and me and each of us. Others speak of\na mind-dust, ultimate elements or atoms of conscious-\nness, which may be brought together in greater or lesser\nmasses or streams to form what each of us calls his con-\nsciousness.\nIf I am asked\u2014has my more intimate study of these\ncases of divided personalities led me to accept this way\nof regarding consciousness ; has this way forced itself\nupon me as an inevitable conclusion from the facts ?\n\u2014\nI reply\u2014not in the least. The argument for the unity\nof the ego seems to me as strong and conclusive as ever.\nAnd that other way of regarding consciousness, as a\nstuff which can be divided into smaller or united into\nlarger streams, seems to me just as impossible and false\nas ever it did. Do I then deny the facts on which the\ncritics of the ego rely 1 No\u2014I accept these facts as\nestabhshed. I believe we are compelled to recognise\nthat sometimes, and not infrequently, a single human\norganism or person is the seat of more than one stream\nof conscious knowing, feeling and striving, more than\none train of mental activity ; and that these trains may\nbe not only distinct, but may be in acute opposition and\nconflict one with another, just as really as I may be in\nconflict with you, a conflict of purposes, of efforts towards\ndifferent ends.\nIf my former conclusion holds good, it follows that\neach of such distinct streams of purposive effort is the\nactivity of a unitary self or ego. Are we then to fiy\nto the ancient theory of possession, whenever we observe\nevidence of such multiphcity of distinct mental activities\nwithin a single organism ? By no means. The obvious\nand, I believe, inevitable inference from the facts is that\nI who consciously address you am only one among several\n\f112 William McDougall, M.B., F.R.S. [part\nselves or egos which my organism, my person, comprises.\nI am only the dominant member of a society, an as-\nsociation of similar members. There are many purposive\nactivities within my organism of which I am not aware,\nwhich are not my activities but those of my associates.\nI am conscious at any moment only of those processes\nwithin the organism, and of those impressions from with-\nout, which it is most .necessary that I should take cog-\nnisance of. And I consciously control and adjiist only\na few of the executive processes of my organism, those\nonly which are of primary importance for my purposes.\nBut I and my associates are all members of one body\n;\nand, so long as the whole organism is healthy, we work\nharmoniously together, for we are a well-organised society,\nthe members of which strive for a common good, the\ngood of the whole society. My subordinates serve me\nfaithfully in the main, provided always that I continue\nto be resolute and strong. But, when I relax my control,\nin states of sleep, hypnosis, relaxation and abstraction,\nmy subordinates, or some of then, continue to work and\nthen are apt to manifest their activities in the forms we\nhave learnt to call sensory and motor automatisms.\nAnd if I am weak and irresolute, if I do not face the\nproblems of life and take the necessary decisions for\ndeahng with them, then conflict arises within our system,\none or more of my subordinates gets out of hand, I\nlose my control, and division of the personality into\nconflicting systems replaces the normal and harmonious\nco-operation of all members in one system. And in\nextreme cases such a revolted subordinate, escaped from\nthe control of the dominant member or monad, may\ncontinue his career of insubordination indefinitely, acquir-\ning increased influence over other members of the society\nand becoming a serious rival to the normal ruler or\ndominant. Such a rebellious member was the famous\nSally Beauchamp, and such was, I suggest, the childish\nphase of the Doris Fischer case. All such automatisms\nimply literally a dis-association of the society or associa-\ntion.^\n1 See Appendix, p. 121.\n\fLxxx.] Presidential Address. 113\nWe may, I think, see a close analogy between the\norganisation of such a society of selves and that of an\narmy. At headquarters sits the general or commander-\nin-chief. Through a radiating system of telephone wires\nhe constantly receives reports which inform him of the\ngeneral condition and activities of each part ; and chiefly\nhis attention at any moment is given to the reports\nfrom areas of greatest activity. But he is not made\nacquainted with every detail of the life and activity of\nthe army ; the reports which reach him have passed\nupwards through a hierarchy of officers of successively\nhigher rank ; at each stage they have been condensed\nand epitomised ; and from those parts of the whole\norganisation where everything is going on smoothly in\nroutine fashion no report is made. Thus his information\nis always highly general ; it is the cream skimmed from\nthe whole mass of facts. His powers of attention and\nassimilation permit him only such epitomised and highly\ncondensed information. In the same way, the orders\nthat he gives are general only. He decides and gives\norders only on the larger movements. The working of\nthem out in detail is effected by the descending series\nof members of the hierarchy ; his orders are concerned\nonly with new adjustments and movements of the whole\nor its parts ; and to those parts which are executing\nroutine actions, he issues no orders ; to do so would\ndiminish rather than increase their efficiency ; it would\nbe a needless and unwarranted interference with his\nexperienced subordinates, who exercise at their discretion\nan authority delegated by him.\nEspecially if any disorder or disharmony of the parts\nof the system arises, his authority is required to restore\norder ; he continues to suffer pain or distress which dis-\ntracts his attention from all other duties until the disorder\nis rectified.\nThis analogy gives us, I suggest, a true picture of the\nlife of the human organism. One great difference obtains\nbetween the two systems of our analogy. In the army\nthe general's touch with all parts of the organism is\neffected through a material system of written and printed\n\f114 William McDougall, M.B., F.R.S. [part\norders and telephone wires and dispatch riders. In the\norganism on the other hand communication between the\nmembers seems to be direct, that is to say it seems to\nbe of the nature of reciprocal telepathic rapport, in\nlarge part at least. But still the dominant monad is\nin direct rapport, not with every member of the system,\nbut only with those immediately beneath him in the hier-\narchy ; and the same seems to be true of every member\nof the system. Thus my consciousness is not a '\ncol-\nlective consciousness,' it is not a fusion of the minor\nconsciousnesses of the subordinate members of my organ-\nism. By our fundamental postulate such fusion is\nimpossible. It is rather a condensed essence of all their\nseparate and distinct consciousnesses ; it reflects what\nin them is most essential, whatever is most necessary for\nme to know ; and this is presented to me in a conveniently\ncondensed and elaborated form. That this is really true\nwe see on considering any complex act of perception,\nas when I perceive visually a complex field of objects.\nBetween the impressions on my sense organ and the\ncompleted perception there intervenes a large amount of\nsynthetic activity of truly mental nature ; this is the\nwork of my subordinates. And only certain features\nof the whole field in which I am most interested come\nfully to my consciousness in elaborated detail ; much of\nthe rest of the field remains outside my consciousness,\nbut nevertheless plays a part in determining the total\nreaction of my organism, subconsciously as we say, i.e.\nthrough the work of my subordinates.\nAnd in executing any complex bodily action, I make\nthe decision or choice of action and issue a general order,\nbut of the details of its execution I remain for the most\npart unconscious, although these details are guided by\nmentally elaborated impressions on my sense organs,\nagain the work of my subordinates.\nLet us see how this conception throws Ught upon certain\nforms of automatism so trequent and widespread as to\nfall within the bounds of the normal. In sleep I, the\ndominant member of my system, become passive and inert\n;\nI cease to send out controlling messages. My subordinates.\n\fliXXX.] Presidential Address. 115\nreleased from my controlling purposes, may continue\nto be alert and to think their own thoughts ; and these\nare more or less reflected in my passive self as dream-\nimages and dream-thoughts. Since the modes of activity\nof these subordinates are more primitive, nearer to the\npurely organic and instinctive, than my own (for we\nmust suppose that the mental functions are delegated\nto them in an order corresponding to their positions in\nthe hierarchy, the most primitive to those lowest in the\nscale, the less primitive to those nearer to myself) the\ndream shews those archaic primitive and intuitive qual-\nities which have been so well pointed out by Dr. C. G.\nJung. And they come to my consciousness as some-\nthing wholly foreign to myself, in the shaping of which\nmy purposes and my thinking have had no share.\nIn hypnosis also I am passive and my subordinates\nwork independently of my control. They may receive\nand understand, retain and execute suggestions of which\nI remain unconscioixs. And, if they carry out these sug-\ngestions in the posthypnotic period, I may be surprised\nto find myself performing actions of which I have no\nintention and no prevision ;\nand, if I attempt to inhibit\nor prevent such actions, I may be aware of a real diffi-\nculty in doing so, i.e. a difficulty in controlhng and\nsubduing the efforts of my subordinates.\nFrequently I form an intention and initiate a train of\naction for its execution and then I may turn my attention\nto other topics, while my faithful subordinates continue\nto work towards the end prescribed. To take a very\nsimple instance, I form the intention to go to a certain\nplace and start out ;\nthen, though I may be wholly\noccupied with thoughts of other things, my purpose is\nduly achieved by my organism, i.e. my subordinates. Or,\na more complex instance, I may set out to play a piece\nof music, and, having begun, may engage in conversation\non other topics, while the execution of my purpose never-\ntheless continues to unroll itself through processes which\ninvolve a great amount of mental activity, including the\nappreciation at every step of the complex musical sounds\nwhich my fingers call from the instrument.\n\f116 William McDougall, M.B., F.R.S. [part\nThis view of the nature of a person thus renders in-\ntelHgible many facts of our normal mental hfe which\non any other view remain paradoxical ; and it solves the\ndifficulty of reconciling the facts of automatism and\ndivided personality with the fundamental principle of the\nunitary ego or self as the ground of the unity of con-\nsciousness. And we can apply it successfully to solve\nanother great difficulty, namely the apparent dependence\nof memory on the integrity of tbe brain. The facts\nwhich seem to imply this dependence have, ever since\nthey began to be discovered, formed a principal support\nof materialism. The facts are that destruction of this\nor that part of the brain seems to deprive me of certain\nmemories or memory functions. And the assumption of\nmaterialism, reached by an inference from these facts,\nis that destruction of the whole of my bi'ain would\ndeprive me of all memories.\nNow the view I am putting before you assumes that\neach monad of my system retains the memory of its own\nactivities. Hence I myself retain no memory of a multi-\ntude of the mental activities by which the life of my\nwhole organism has been governed ;\nnamely of all those\nthat belong to my subordinates. Nevertheless these or\nmany of them are normally at my disposal. By suitable\ndirection of my attention I can secure their reflection\nin my consciousness as dreamlike images of the past.\nAnd in hypnosis there seems to be no limit to the\nextetat to which this process may be carried, remote\nevents and details to which my attention was never\ndirected being reflected to my dreaming, passively re-\nceptive self.\nWe may fairly assume that, when a part of my brain\nis destroyed, some grave disorder of my functional rela-\ntions with some of my subordinates must ensue, so that\nI can no longer command their memories, and these are\nfor all practical purposes lost to me. But in spite of\nsuch loss of some part of the memories which normally\nare at my service, I retain the memories of those ex-\nperiences which were most truly my own, and those\npowers of thought and feeling and command which I\n\fLXXX.] Presidential Address. 117\nhave developed by my own efforts in pursuit of the\nends which I have chosen of my own vohtion.\nIf this is true of the destruction of any one part of\nmy brain, we may infer that it would be true also in\nthe event of the destruction of all its parts. Whether\nthere would then remain to me any capacity for sensory\nexperience and sensorial imagination seems to me an\nobscure question that must be left open at the present\ntime. I am inclined to think that sensorial perception\nand imagination are essentially the expression of the\ninteraction of the monads. If that be true, then, unless\nand until I should enter upon relations with some other\nsociety, become a working member of some other system,\nI should enjoy only imageless thought.\nThis way of regarding the effects of brain-injuries upon\nmemory seems to be compatible with all the facts. And\nthere is one class of facts which it seems impossible to\ninterpret in terms of any other hypothesis. I refer to\nthe effects upon sense-perception, produced by destruction\nof certain parts of the sensory cortex of the brain, as\nrecently demonstrated by the brilliant researches of Dr.\nHenry Head.^ These researches seem to have shewn\nthat, when certain sensory areas are destroyed, leaving\nintact the basal ganglia of the brain, the patient does\nnot lose altogether the capacities of sensory experience\nwith which the destroyed areas are concerned. Rather\nhe retains the capacity for the corresponding qualities\nof sensation ; but these sensory experiences are now of a\ncrude undiscriminating kind. The change may be roughly\nexpressed by saying that impressions on the sense organs\nwhich normally initiate delicate intellectualised perceptions,\nevoke in such patients only crude sensations. On the\nview I am putting before you, we may interpret such\nfacts as follows. The sense impressions are normally\ntransmitted through a hierarchy of monads, undergoing\nfurther elaboration at each level, until they are reflected\nto the dominant in a highly elaborated form, conveying\ndelicate spatial, temporal, and other meanings. The\ninjury to the brain throws the higher members of this\n^ Reported in a series of papers in recent volumes of Brain.\n\f118 William McDougall, 31.B., F.R.S. [part\nhierachy out of action. In consequence the lower mem-\nbers must now report directly to the dominant ;\njust\nas, if, in an army, the superior officers of a division are\nthrown out of action, reports to headquarters must be\nsent forward by subordinate officers of the division, who,\nlacking the special experience of their incapacitated\nsuperiors, will report crudely and inadequately, so that\ntheir reports will reach headquarters lacking the intel-\nlectual elaboration and condensation which normally\ncharacterise them. That seems to be a quite satisfactory\ninterpretation of the facts of this order, and I can con-\nceive of no alternative ; and I find in this strong\nconfirmation of the hypothesis.\nYou will observe that I take the spatial relations of\nthe parts of the brain to be significant of some real and\nimportant relations. But I do not mean to bind myself\nto the view that the material world and its spatial\nrelations as perceived by us is exactly what it appears\nto be. Nor do I apply to the monads any metaphysical\nadjectives, such as timeless or eternal or immortal or\nindestructible or indivisible ; to do so would be to go\nbeyond the warrant of the facts, it would gratuitously\ninvolve us in difficulties, and it is quite unnecessary.\nFor the purposes of science we may with advantage\nleave the metaphysical questions on one side ; we need\nnot enquire whether what we call the body is merely\nthe appearance to us of the system of monads, i.e. we\nneed not attempt to choose between a dualistic and a\nmonistic, or a pluralistic metaphysic. It is for the\nmetaphysicians to adapt their speculations to the results\nof scientific research as these are brought to light and\nformulated in far-reaching hypotheses.\nThe hypothesis which I sketch in vaguest outline\nbrings before our minds a host of new questions to\nwhich we cannot at present return any definite answers.\nBut this does not in any sense detract from its value\nor raise any presumption against it. Any such far-\nreaching hypothesis must have this result, which is indeed\nevidence of its value as a guide to research. Among such\nquestions tliree stand out very prominently for my mind.\n\fLXXX.] Presidential Address. 119\nFirst, Plato described the soul as a charioteer, con-\ntrolling with more or less success a team of powerful\nunruly creatures, the passions, which draw him along in\nreckless fury. This has usually been regarded as a liter-\nary metaphor. May we, in the light of the view I am\nputting before you, take this description to be literally\ntrue ? In other words\u2014is each of the great primary\ninstinctive tendencies of our nature the peculiar function\nof some one subordinate monad ? It is a possibility\nthat deserves consideration.\nSecondly, what is the relation of the dominant monad\nto heredity and evolution ? Is he not only the ruler of\nhis society, but also the patriarch and progenitor ? I\ndo not see how we can avoid the assumption that the\nmonads are propagated by a process analogous to bud-\nding. And this process must be of two kinds. On\nthe one hand a throwing off of a bud which contains\nall the potentialities and powers of the progenitor and is\ncapable of becoming the progenitor of a new society\nand hence of governing the whole development of a new\nindividual organism. On the other hand, a process of\nbudding off subordinates to which only subordinate\npowers are delegated. And, since the development of\nthe individual mirrors that of the race, we must suppose\nthat these functions are delegated in an order which\nrecapitulates that delegation of functions which must\nhave 'been the essential process in the specialisation and\ndifferentiation of racial types. Such specialisation and\ndifferentiation of functions within the organism can only\nhave been' combined with continued effective integration\nof the organism through such extensive delegation of\nfunctions combined with continued dominance of the\nparent monad.\nLastly, there is the question of the bearing of this\nview upon the great problem which for so many members\nof the Society for Psychical Research is or should be\nits predominating interest, the problem of life after\ndeath. Well, adoption of our hypothesis would necessitate\na development of our view of the life after death of the\nbody, one directly in line with the development which\n#\n\f1\n120 William McDougall, M.B., F.R.S. [part\nthat view has already undergone in the slow process of !\ncultural evolution. Primitive man conceived the dead as\nhaving still not only the bodily form and organs but also j\nthe dress and ornaments and weapons which they bore in\n'\nthis life. Then these external adjuncts of personality were\n|\ngiven up, and men were content to conceive the dead ;\nas having the naked bodily form and organs only. ;\nBy a further and comparatively recent step, the con-\nj\nception of the dead was purged of the material embodi- I\nment, and men learned to think of them as spirits devoid !\nof bodily form ; but they continue to expect that the '\ndeparted soul should retain every mental function and \\\nthe memory of every mental activity manifested through-\n'\nout the life of the organism. .\nBut now, I suggest, we\nhave to make a further step and piirge our conception !\nstill further. I, if I survive the dissolution of my bodily\norganism, shall, by our hypothesis, retain only those\nfunctions which I have not delegated but have developed\nby active exercise and those memories which are most !\ntruly mine, the memories of my own activities. And\n'\nafter all is not this truly a gain, an advance of our i\nconception ? Does it not represent that purification from j\ndross and from the lower elements of which so many ;\nseers have spoken ?\nFurther, it would seem to follow that, just as in this\n'\nlife I live effectively and fully only by actively partici- ;\npating in the life of an intimately organised society of j\nlike members, so hereafter can I hope to live richly and\nsatisfactorily only by entering into and playing an active ;\npart as a member of some other society which will de-\nmand my faithful co-operation and service. For we are\nessentially social beings ; outside of and apart from such\nintimate communion, our selves would have no meaning\nand no value, and perhaps could not be said to live or ;\nbe conscious in any intelligible sense of those words. '\nI venture to think that these considerations may\nafiord some guidance, if they are kept in mind when we\nconfront the baffling problems, the perplexities and dis-\nappointments which seem to be the lot of those bent upon\nthe major quest of Psychical Research. .;\n\u2022I\n\fLXXX.] Presidential Address. 121\nAPPENDIX.\nI WOULD draw attention to Dr. Morton Prince's discussion of his\ncelebrated case B. C. A. {Journal of Abnormal Psychology, October\n1919). This case was closely similar in many respects to the better\nknown case of Miss Beauchamp. I accept almost all the inter-\npretations that Dr. Prince arrives at in his illuminating discussion\nof this case ; but I would point out that all his facts and almost\nall of his interpretations, in terms largely of instinctive conative\ntendencies, are all perfectly compatible with the view I am advocating.\nFurther, Dr. Prince makes certain observations and admissions which\nare difficult to reconcile with any other view. I cite one of these as\nfollows :\n\" This feeling by a secondary personality that certain conscious\nexperiences belong or belonged to her own personal consciousness or\nego and that others do not, or did not, belong is a common pheno-\nmenon in such cases and is of great significance. It is a phenomenon\nwhich justifies the inference that the relation which one system of ideas\nbears to that which we call the ego is different from that of the other\nsystem ; it is a phenomenon, too, which must be taken into account\nin solving the problem of the ego. When we study the records of\ncases of multiple personality we find as a frequent observation that\nthe secondar3' personality distinguishes between the conscious experi-\nences which belong to itself and those which belong to the principal\npersonality, and to other secondary personalities, if more than one.\nThis differentiation is based upon the feeling of self-consciousness being\nattached to the foirner and not to the latter. It is not, therefore,\nsimply a matter of the experiences occurring at different chronological\nepochs. Indeed the two different sets of experiences may be synchron-\nous, one being conscious and the other co-conscious\" (p. 241). Dr.\nPrince also writes\n\u2014\" The bearing of amnesia on the principle of multiple\npersonality, perhaps, needs a few words. From the facts as they\ndeveloped in this case, it must be obvious that the presence or absence\nof amnesia in no wa3' affects the reality of altered or secondary person-\nality. It was quite as much a personality (i.e. the secondary) before\nthe development of amnesia as afterwards. Before this appeared the\npatient as A in no way differed in characteristics (other than amnesia)\nfrom what she was afterwards, and the same is true of B. The\namnesia simply made the contrast between the phases more ob-\ntrusive ; that was all. If, therefore, following the amnesia each phase\ncan be rightly interpreted\u2014and of this there can be no doubt\u2014as a\ndissociated personality, the same must be true of it antecedent to loss\nof memory \" (p. 276). Here we see Dr. Prince rightly repudiates the\nview (which, I think, may be rightly associated with the name of\nProf. Janet), that the alternating personalities are merely parts of the\nmemory continuum disconnected from one another. And the facts re-\nported are difficult to reconcile with any view other than the view\nthat the personalities or selves of the dissociated condition already\nexisted as distinct selves before their dissociation was effected. The\ndissociation seems to have been completed or achieved in or by hyp-\nnosis, as shewn in the following passage :\n\u2014\" A few days after the B\nI\n\f122 William McDougall, M.B., F.R.8. [part\npersonality had appeared in hypnosis this phase spontaneously waked\nand alternated as it had previously done with the A complex. But\nnow . . . there was amnesia on the part of A for B. The explanation\nfor this is undoubtedly to be found in the fact that a new synthesis\nand more complete dissociation of the B complex {i.e. from .4) had\ntaken place through the experience of hypnosis. Analogous pheno-\nmena I have observed in making experimental observations, but it\nwould take us too far away to enter into this question here \" (p. 276).\nThe suggestion is that hypnosis impaired the rapport between A and\nB ; and the facts related imply, it mil be seen, that A and B existed\nas distinct selves before the dissociation. I suggest that such impair-\nment of rapport is of the essence of hypnosis, as of normal sleep also.\nIn the same number of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Prof.\nC. E. Cory of the Washington University describes a well-marked case\nof divided personality of a type somewhat different from Dr. Prince's\ntwo classical cases. In some respects it is even more favourable than\nthose cases to the hypothesis sketched in this address, and more difficult\nto reconcile witli any other. The case exhibited alternation of two\ndistinct personalities, A and B. \" Although A has been changed in\nsome ways by the dissociation her memory is continuous with the\norigmal self. i? is a secondary personality.\" Prof. Cory finds good\nevidence of '\nco-consciousness '\nof both A and B. The following extracts\nillustrate this point and also the probability that B existed as a distinct\nself before her emergence in control of the bodily organism. \" The\nperception of the submerged self, and this is true of both A and B,\nis never quite the same as those received when in the active role.\nFrom repeated descriptions of A and B of how the world appears\nwhen they see it subconsciously I get the impression that it is the\nsame only less real. B has described it as '\nseeing it through a\nwindow, then going outside.' In thi.s manner she says she saw the\nworld for years before she '\ngot out.' ... As subconscious, the content\nof iJ's vision may differ from that of A. She may note many things\nwhich escape .4. She says she has often seen things in a shop window\nthat A did not. Both can read a page at the same time. . . A\nreports that her hand has turned the page before she was ready, B\nhaving sBready finished it. . . . If B, as subconscious, is deeply dis-\nturbed, say depressed or angry, A may also experience some distress,\npossibly some shade of the same emotion, or it may be a general\nfeeling of uneasiness. If B is so disposed she can determine to a\nlarge extent ^'s reactions to situations and people.\" Again\u2014\" B's\nmemory is in some respects good, even remarkable. Her memory of\nA'a early life is much better than .4's. During these descriptions by\nB, A sees these scenes of her childhood pass before her, reproduced\nmuch as they might be in hypnosis. . . . Unlike many, perhaps most,\ncases of dissociation each of these two selves is conscious of what the\nother does, that is, when either appears she is aware of what the\nother has done. There are thus no gaps in the conduct, and as far\nas the actual conduct goes there is, therefore, no amnesia. But the\ninner thought that lies back of an act is known only as much as the\n\fLXXX.] Presidential Address. 123\nother sees fit to reveal. In this regard they are related much like\nany two friends that know each other well.\" B also produced evidence\nin support of her claim that she could force a dream upon A, or,\nremaining awake while A slept, awake her at any required time. A\nmodus Vivendi was established between the two personalities, an agreed\nalternating dominance of A and B. \" The strain on A with B sub-\nconscious (i.e. before emergence of B to occasional dominance) seems\nto have been greater than it is under the present modus vivendi. As\nit is, her peace depends upon sharing life occasionally with B. Unless\nthis is done B creates disturbances both mental and physical that\nare highly undesirable.\" These few extracts from this record of\nobservations (which seem to have been made with a care and knowledge\nthat inspire confidence) illustrate not only '\nco-consciousness ' but\nalso reciprocal influence between the two co-conscious personalities,\nand they seem quite inconsistent with any view which would regard\nthe alternation of the two personalities as merely the expression of dis-\ncontinuitj' of two trains of memory.\n\f124 Hubert Wales. [part\nII.\nA REPORT ON A SERIES OF CASES OF APPARENT\nTHOUGHT TRANSFERENCE WITHOUT CON-\nSCIOUS AGENCY.\nBy Hubert Wales.\nIntroductory.\nOn the 3rcl of August, ''918, I received a letter from a\ntotal stranger\u2014not an uncommon occurrence with nie.\nOn this occasion, the immediate cause was the pubhcation\nin a newspaper of half a dozen hues I had written on\nsome subject connected with psychical research. My\ncorrespondent, it appeared, was a Miss Jane Samuels,\nand I gathered from her remarks and from subsequent\ncommunications that she was in charge of a stationery\nand fancy-goods shop in London, to which printing and\nphotographic branches were attached.\nShe began the letter by asking me if I were interested\nin telepathy from the dead or from the living. That\nway of opening communication between us seems in\nitself to call for a passing comment. The popular or\nspiritualistic view, as is well known, regards communication\nfrom the dead and supernormal communication between\nthe living as two separate and distinct processes, not\nonly without fellowship, but almost antagonistic ; and\nMiss Samuels, I learnt later, though not an avowed\nmember of the spiritualistic body, keeps up a running\nand interested association with it. To me it seems that,\nif the dead survive and can communicate with us at\nall, the means can only be telepathic. It would appear,\ntherefore, that the introductory words of Miss Samuels's\nletter were fitted, with a happy intuition, to the ideas\nof its addressee, who is now expressing his views\non the subject, publicly, for the first time.\n\fLxxx.] Apparent Thought Transference. ,\n125\nMy correspondent went on to say that, for the previous\nfive years, she had noticed that certain impressions of\nhers (I am giving the gist, I do not profess to be quoting\nthe exact words, of the letter) corresponded in a marked\ndegree with the thoughts of her friends, particularly\nwith those of one friend, Mr. H. H. Fuller, at one time\nthe manager of her photographic department, but then\nin the army and ^quartered at the Curragh Camp in\nIreland, where he was employed in teaching photography\nto pilots and observers of the Air Force. I have learnt\nlater that these impressions are obtained, for the most\npart, though not exclusively, during sleep, and take,\nI imagine, primarily, though again not exclusively, a\nvisual form ; but Miss Samuels appears to distinguish\nthem in themselves, apart from their veridicality, from\nordinary dreams.^\nThe next time I was in London, which happened to be\nin about a week, I went to see Miss Samuels. I found\nher the antithesis of the type of person usually associated\nwith mysterious powers\u2014active and energetic to the\npoint of restlessness and exceedingly talkative and full\nof spirits. One could hardly conceive her getting her\nmind into a state of passivity for a transitory moment.\nShe was frankly (indeed, proudly) Jewish, and very\nmuch interested in her \" telepathy.\" (The question was\nquite candidly begged on her part\u2014dreams, notes,\ndrawings, thoughts and feehngs, of certain kinds, were\nall \" my telepathy.\") In the course of three short\ncaUs I made upon her\u2014aU during a week's visit to\nLondon in August, 1918\u2014she showed me over her shop\nand business premises, introduced me to her assistants,\ntook my photograph and talked to me in the intervals of\nattending to customers. These three interviews occupied\naltogether perhaps an hour or an hour and a half :\nI had not seen her before, and I have not seen her since.\nIn the course of these talks, I arranged with her to\nmake notes of her impressions, which she had not\n1 See Proc, Vol. XX., p. 148, for an apparently similar distinction,\nby Mrs. Verrall, in her own case, between '\nvivid impressions in sleep\n\"\nand \" the ordinary dream.\"\n\f126 Hubert Wales. [PAET\npreviously been in the habit of doing, having merely related\nsuch of them as she chanced to remember the next day.\nThis, let me say at once, she has heroically done, night\nafter night, for several months, taking a note-book to\nbed with her, and making notes at all manner of un-\nearthly hours, whenever she happened to wake, often\nin the dark. As one who does not take at all kindly\nto .exerting himself after he has got to bed, I feel\nparticularly that those of us who are interested in getting\nto the bottom of the questions upon which this paper\ntouches, owe her a debt of gratitude for having put\nherself to this considerable inconvenience in the interests\nof scientific research. She was to post the notes to me\nat once, and I undertook to forward copies of them to\nMr. Fuller for his comments.\nThis procedure, which was carried out from 10th August\nto 4th November, 1918, produced some striking corre-\nspondences, but I coiild see no way of getting them\non a sound evidential basis. Mr. Fuller was not in a\nposition (he was a private in the army) to obtain written\ncorroboration of his statements, and\u2014though I had no\nreason to doubt his bo7ia fides and have since become\nperfectly satisfied of it, and though small discrepancies\nwere noted in his comments with apparent care\u2014it was\nimpossible to prove that the stories upon which the\ncorrespondences depended were not sheer invention and\nthat the noting of discrepancies was not \" the perfection\nof acting.\" Fortunately, however, I found an increasing\ntendency in Miss Samuels' s notes of her impressions\n'\nto correspond with incidents affecting my own thoughts,\nand, since I was usually in a position to obtain written\ncorroboration of my statements in regard to them, I\ngradually concentrated upon these, and ultimately dis-\ncontinued forwarding the notes to Mr. Fuller.\nThe most remarkable results obtained t-hrough him, I\nthink, were in respect of the apparent transference '\nof\nbodily sensations, particularly pains. There was such\na degree of accurate correspondence of this kind, according\nto Mr. Fuller's comments, that I got tired of copying\nand forwarding the notes, and at last asked Miss Samuels\n\fLXXX.] Apparent Thought Transference. 127\nnot to trouble to send more, since there appeared to\nbe no object in further piling up coincidences. These\npercepts, I gathered from Miss Samuels, do not form\npart of her regular sleeping impressions, but are obtained\nin the normal waking state at all hours of the day,\nare sometimes so severe as to cause her to resort to\n\" real remedies \" (though she appears never to have\nany difficulty in distinguishing them from her \" own\npains \"), and the time coincidence is usually pretty exact.\nShe told me, and I think Mr. Fuller did too, that, when\nshe first obtained these particular impressions, she was\nLiable to get the right kind of sensation, in the right\nlocality, but on the wrong side of the body\n\u2014\ne.g. a cut\non the third finger of the right hand would emerge as\na cut on the third finger of the left hand. I cannot\nsay if either of them knew that a similar peculiarity\nhas been observed in the case of other percipients. A\nlist of these impressions, with Mr. Fuller's comments, is\ngiven in the Appendix (p. 213). They have, I think,\nan evident bearing on the curious power evinced by\nsome mediums and their controls to diagnose ailments.^\n(Compare Mr. Guthrie's experiments at close quarters,\nreported in Proceedings, Pt. IX.) I have observed no\ncorrespondences in respect of bodily sensations in my\nown case, at least no more than can easily be assigned\nto chance.\nIn her first letter Miss Samuels told me that, if Mr.\nFuller deliberately tried to convey a thought to her, she\ndid not get it, though she sometimes got a sense of effort.\nMy experience has confirmed this. I feel bound to say,\nhowever, that, finding my thoughts were apparently\ncommunicated without trouble, I have made no persistent\nor particularly strenuous attempts consciously to transmit\nthem. I remember, one evening, trying for some time to\nconcentrate my mind on the buffalo picture which has been\nthe subject of a successful thought transference experiment\n(reproduced in Proceedings, Pt. LXIX., p. 312), to form\n1 Miss Samiiels tells me she has often seat Mr. Fuller homely remedies\nfor ailments of which she %vas cognisant only through corresponding\nsymptoms in herself.\n\f128 Hubert Wales. [part\na mental image of it and so on ; but nothing in the\nleast suggesting it appeared subsequently in Miss Samuels'\ns\nnotes. On another occasion I struck the back of my left\nhand repeatedly with the bristles of a hair-brush, till\nI drew blood ; but since Miss Samuels remained indifferent\nto my sufferings, I did not repeat the experiment.\nWhether or not, with more persistence, I might ultimately\nhave succeeded in transmitting a thought by active\nendeavour, it remains the fact, as will be seen, that\nMiss Samuels \"s veridical impressions have rarely corre-\nsponded with anything even in the main current of\nmy thought, but with incidental reflections, transitory\nimpressions about trifles, sometimes with things I have\nmerely overheard and of which I have consciously retained\nonly an imperfect knowledge. On her side Miss Samuels\nsays similarly : \"I seem to have little to do with the\nmatter, only like a telephone, just to receive all kinds\nof messages.\" For these reasons I do not regard what\nfollows as a record of experiments in a strict sense of\nthe term\u2014for, as Andrew Lang (I think it was) said,\nyou cannot experiment consciously in the unconscious\n\u2014\nbut of systematic observations of spontaneous phenomena.\nThe instances of apparent thought transference with\nwhich I propose to deal in this report, consisting in\nthe main of correspondences with my own thoughts, have\noccurred in a period of, roughly, eight months, from\nabout the middle of August, 1918, to about the middle\nof April, 1919. During this time Miss Samuels has sent\nme notes of her impressions, with few exceptions, daily\n\u2014\nsometimes several sheets, sometimes only a few words.\nIt is manifestly out of the question that I should\nattempt to lay before the Society the whole of this\nmass of material, or even a large proportion of it.\nMoreover, the difficulties in the way of making a\nclassification of Miss Samuels's impressions, so as to give\nsome idea of the ratio of success to failure, as regards\ncorrespondence with my thoughts, are exceptionally great,\nbecause of her apparent liability to be influenced by a\nvariety of agents. For this reason it seemed useless\nto try to make any such classification for the period\n\fLxxx.] Apparent Thought Transference. 129\nsubsequent to 4th November, 1918, when I ceased to\nsend copies of Miss Samuels' s notes regularly to Mr.\nFuller. The tabular statement which follows, therefore,\nis limited to the period from 17th August, 1918, when\nMiss Samuels first attributed impressions to my agency,\nto 4th November, 1918. I have counted everything in the\nnotes for this period, except impressions attributed by\nMiss Samuels, at the time of despatching the notes, to\nsome other person than myself, or in regard to which some\nother person has noted a suggestive correspondence with\nhis or her thoughts. This, of course, takes no account of\npossible agents who cannot be traced, of the difficulty\nof remembering transitory thoughts about trivial things\neven for a day or two, or of occasional possible unwilling-\nness on the part of a person suggested as the agent to\nacknowledge correspondence. (For an instance of denial\nsee Case XLVIII. below.) But any error introduced from\nthese causes is error on the safe side, so the amount\nof success shown may be taken as a minimum.\nAnother difiiculty has been to decide what constitutes\na single impression. Usually the line dividing one from\nanother is pretty clear, and Miss Samuels not uncommonly\nhas indicated it in her notes ; but occasionally it is\nblurred, and occasionally a topic recurs, other matters\nintervening between the references. In the latter cases\nI have counted as one impression all references to the\nsame subject, whether scattered or compact.\nThe following are illustrations of the standard I have\nset up and tried to maintain in assigning impressions\nto particular categories. \" Some poor people are worried\nabout paying their rent, it's really only a small amount \"\n(Case XI.) I have put in Class 2, as veridical but\nconfused. Had the form been, \" Someone is worried\nabout some poor people paying their rent,\" I should\nhave put it in Class 1. The note concerning trays and\nclips (Case XXXI.) I have put in Class 1, in spite of\nits confusion, the exact correspondence with the dimensions\nof the trays and with the number\u20144\u2014bringing it above\nthe standard. These two I regard as good examples of\nborder-line cases.\n\f130 Hubert Wales. [part\nIn the sub-classification, the- distinction between corre-\nspondences that are undistinctive and those that are\nconfused was often difficult to make, and little reliance\ncan be placed upon it. The cases placed under these\nheads are of very different values, ranging from, e.g., the\nnote \" Someone drinks and it goes down the wrong way,\"\nwhich corresponded with a very rare misfortuije of that\nnature, in my case, on the evening preceding the date\nof the impression, to such an indefinite and generally\napplicable statement as \" a railway line crossed.\" I\nshould perhaps make clear, in regard to this Class 2,\nthat my classification means that each correspondence\nincluded in it, considered individually, can be attributed to\nchance without strain.

These changes of place\nhave had no noticeable effect upon the results ; about\nthe same average of veridical impressions has been main-\ntained throughout. I have been at my home at Hind-\nhead, forty miles from London, during the whole period,\nexcept for two visits of a night at a time to London,\nwithout the knowledge of Miss Samuels.^ It is worth remark-\ning, for its bearing on the momentous question whether\ntelepathy (assuming its occurrence) be a psychical or a\nphysical phenomenon, that Miss Samuels has many times\ntold me that the impressions which appear to her to\ncome from Mr. Fuller (and which usually have had an\napparent correspondence with his thoughts) are far clearer\nand easier to remember than those which appear to\nher to come from me ;\nindeed, as will be seen later, she\nhas repeatedly attributed to my agency impressions,\nwhich have proved to be veridical as regards me, because\nof their relative feebleness. Mr. Fuller, as has been\nsaid, was stationed, at the time, at the Curragh Camp,\nnear Dublin, a distance, I think, of about 400 miles\nfrom London ; while I, according to information derived\nfrom the nearest milestone to my house, am forty miles\n1 These visits both took place during the period when Miss Samuels\nwas sleeping in London. Nothing of interest occurred in her notes\non either occasion.\n\f132 Hubert Wales. [part\nfrom Hyde Park Corner. There is, I understand, a\nsympathetic link between Miss Samuels and Mr. Fuller\n;\nbetween the former and me there is no link beyond\nour common interest in the phenomena.\nI have been careful to tell Miss Samuels nothing of\nmy personal circumstances or relationships, either in\nmy few talks with her or in my subsequent letters and\ncomments on her notes. It seemed to me to be necessary,\nin order to maintain her interest, to tell her in general\nterms when she correctly described or referred to matters\nwhich had been in my thoughts, and I have accordingly\ndone so ; but I think I have contrived to word these\nstatements without giving her substantially more information\nthan the percept itself contained.\nShe does not, for instance, know at the time of writing\n\u2014\nand probably will not know until she reads this report\n\u2014\nwhether I am married or single.^ In very many cases\nI have told her merely that particular notes were \" appro-\npriate \" or \" relevant \" or \" good \" or something similar.\nShe understands the reason for this reticence and has\nfully approved it. Only one thing I can remember\nhaving let slip\u2014that I occasionally do some gardening.\nThat was in August, 1918, when I was talking to her\nin her shop ; but in any case, no doubt, the fact would\nhave had to be regarded as an easy inference from the\ncircumstance that I live in the country. She has told\nme that she has once, some years ago, been to Hindhead\nfor a day, and knows, therefore, its general features,\nparticularly that it is on a hill, amid trees.\nBefore I proceed to quote extracts from the notes\nand my contemporary comments, there is some necessary\ninformation regarding them to be given. The notes\nhave been written, as I have said, for the most part\nin bed, and often in the dark ; for Miss Samuels, I\n1 I find that in the 1918 edition of Who's Who only the titles of\nmy books and my address are given. I have some impression that\nI furnished rather fuller particiilars for the 1919 edition, but not enough\nto impair any correspondence discussed in this paper.\nWho's Who, I think, is a source of leakage liable to be overlooked.\nI have found, for instance, that Mrs. Verrall's address, at the time\nit emerged in Mrs. Holland's script, was given in it.\n\fLXXX.] Apparent Thought Transference. 133\nunderstand, does not sleep alone, but with a sister,\nwhom she has had to be careful not to disturb.

For my transcriptions\nI have used the rough notes whenever it has been possible\nto do so, resorting to the typed copies only in cases where\nthe degree of illegibility in the originals was such that\nno consecutive meaning could be extracted from them.\nThere have been often, indeed usually, verbal discre-\npancies between the rough notes and the typed copies.\nI have ignored these where the sense is unafiected, but\nin cases where there is any shade of variation in the\nmeaning, I have given, within square brackets, the typed\nversion, in addition to the original version.\nWhere the sense is beyond doubt, I have corrected\nthe spelling.

This is because, in the case of slight or\nuncertain correspondences, I have not felt justified in\nbothering my friends to write statements ;\nbecause, in\nsome cases, the subject of the correspondence is a docu-\nment which is in itself corroborative ; and because, in a\nconsiderable number of cases, the correspondence is based\non some thought or trivial incident known to me alone.\nIn the quotations that follow, omitted words or passages,\nwhich are shown by dots, always relate, or apparently so,\nto matters unconnected with the impression discussed.\nI.\nExtract from Miss Sammls's notes {received August 22, 1918).\nAugust 21, 1918. 6.30 a.m.\nI am tying or doing something with rope in a garden.\nThese mixed thoughts are so faint and indistinct that\nI think they came from or comaected with Mr. Wales.\nThe garden or round the garden needs the ground to\nbe loosened, not only the lawn grass cut.

I had not told Miss Samuels\nthe times of the postal deliveries ; indeed, until the last few days,\nthe evening post has arrived about four.

I can remember the corner where\nthe man stood, and the quiet, unemotional voice in which,\nat regular intervals, he said the words. Scores and\nhundreds of times since have I repeated them to myself.\nIt has become, in fact, one of those foolish, private\nlittle habits which we are all liable to contract.

It will be seen j\nthat the extract quoted above appears to contain nine ;\ncorrespondences with it : for it dealt with a man i\n(Oedipus) (1) who was old, (2) who was of noble birth\n'\nand character, (3) who was led, (4) who made a strong\nspeech (Mr. Piddington made a point of his impressive\nspeech before his death, discussing it and quoting from it),\nj\n(5) who was a character in a play, (6) who was ill,\n(7) who was blind, (8) who wore draped clothing, and\n(9) who was accompanied by others who also wore draped\nclothing. Indeed, the note, so far as it goes, contains\nnothing irrelevant, for the reference to a painting is an\nalternative. I may add that, when reading Mr. Pidding-\nton's paper, I conceived Oedipus, for some reason, going\noff the stage at the back, after making his final speech,\nso that the other actors, in relation to him, would be\nin the foreground.\nIt will be noticed that the apparent thought transference in\nthis case is exclusively of the part of Mr. Piddington's paper i\ndeaUng with Oedipus, not of the part dealing with Mrs.\nVerrall's script.

It was of the shape of a\nbook, the groundwork of pale yellow, with the words\n'\nBlue Flame '\n(the title of one of my novels) in pink\nicing on it. Spirit was burning round it, which gave\nme the impression that it was warm, and I was considerably\nsurprised, when I tasted it, to find that it was iced.\nI may have thought of this iricident recently.\n^ It was in August, 1918, during the visit to London when I made\nacquaintance with Miss Samuels.\n\f152 Hubert Wales. [part\nCorroborative letter from the friend (a woman) who dined\nwith me on the occasion referred to in my note, dated\nMarch 3, 1919.\nDear Mr. Wales, I often think of the '\nBlue Flame\n'\ndinner we had together at the Florence, and what a\nsurprise Mons Rene [should be Rena] gave us in the\nsweet he had prepared . . . When the waiter appeared\ncarrying something on a silver tray we saw at once it\nwas something special, and on further inspection we saw a\nmodel of your book '\nBlue Flame,' and to make it better\nstill when he put a match to it the real blue flames\ndanced all round it and it was just perfect. I can\nsee it now\u2014a pale yellow colour with the title and your\nname in pink with two marguerites made of sugar in the\nopposite corners ... I remember also that at the first\ntaste you had rather a shock finding it was icy cold, as\nyou told me afterwards you were expecting to find it\nquite warm\u2014in reality the outside was composed of wafer\nlike biscuit while the inside was purely ice cream.\nThe receipt of the January Journal, announcing the\nforthcoming meeting, would, for certain reasons, almost\ncertainly lead my thoughts to this episode. I do not\nappear to have made a note of the date when I received\nit, but I find that the printed slip enclosed with it,\nannouncing the meeting, is dated January 15th. The\nrelevance of the apparently paradoxical phrase \" warm\nice cream \" is, I think, somewhat remarkable, and suggests,\nas do many other references, that there must at times\nbe an element other than visual in Miss Samuels' s percepts.\nXXII.\nExtract from Miss Samuels's notes {received January 27, 1919).\nJanuary 26, 1919. 8.45 a.m.\nSomeone does not like being left alone in the house.\nI give my wife's corroboration of my contemporary\nnote.

Two years before, however, nearly to a day,\nmy wife broke her leg ; and the subsequent illness almost\nnecessarily revived memories of this earlier trouble. We\noften talked of it, recalled incidents in connection with\nit, and compared the circumstances in the two cases.

[part\nNote written by H. W., March 3, 1919.\nSeveral times lately, after soaping my face for shaving,\nit has struck me that this gave me the appearance of\nhaving a small Vandyke beard. Once or twice I have\nthought it rather suited me, and I have wondered if I\nshould grow one ! To the best of my recollection it is\nonly lately that I have been struck by this effect. It\nis definitely a small, pointed, as distinguished from a\nsquare, beard that is suggested.\nThis is another of the references that can never, I\nthink, produce upon others the ef?ect it produces upon\nme ; for no doubt many men, when they are shaving,\nthink that they appear to have short, white Vandyke\nbeards. Would such a thought, however, naturally occur\nto a woman ? Miss Samuels, it will be seen, does not\nrefer to shaving, but merely records apparent nonsense\nabout a false beard made with soap-suds.\nA few days after writing the above notes, in turning\nback, for another purpose, over my records of Miss\nSamuels's impressions, I came upon the following, which\nhad suggested nothing to me at the time :\nJanuary 21, 1919. 1.45 a.m.\n.... I saw a dapper little man sharp features, grey\nVandyke beard and moustache (like Captain Kettle but\ngrey.) . . . The old gentleman seemed connected with\nlots of old wood and looking glass and also a broken\ntable.\nNoteworthy points in this, I think, are the allusions to\n'\nlooking-glass '\nand the statement that the beard and\nmoustache were '\ngrey.' For my daily connection with\n'\nlots of old wood ' see my notes to Case IX. above.\nThere is a small table among the rubbish in the outhouse\nreferred to, but I hardly think it is broken, though there\nare many broken things in the place. In Miss Samuels's\nnotes for February 8, 1919, again, the single word \" Van-\ndyke \" occurs. Was she jogging my memory or was I\njogging hers ? In either case, the efforts were apparently\nultimately successful, for the subsequent allusion to a \" false\n\"\n\fLXXX.] Apparent Thought Transference. 155\nbeard and to \" soap suds \" gave me the clue.

The original of the\ndrawing made the sketch herself.\n(2) A night or two ago, not last night, probably the\nnight before (AprU 3, 1919) when I went into the pantry\nto lock up, the cat, who sleeps there with the kitten,\nran out, followed by the kitten. I managed to catch\nthe kitten by its tail as it was trotting down the hall,\nbut had to go much further to get the cat. I then\ntook them back to the pantry, and no doubt threw them\ndown when I got there, for they were a trouble to carry\ntogether [both struggling]. Neither is black and neither\nis tiny.\nMiss Samuels must be assumed to have known that\nI have cats, for there have been many references to them\nin her notes, which I have usually told her were ajopro-\npriate, or something to that effect ; but that would\nnot, of course, account for the coincidence regarding\ncatching by its tail a kitten that was running after\n\f}\n156 Hubert Wales.

In regard to\nthe incorrect statement about the caught kitten being\nblack, it is perhaps worth remarking that, about then, I jj.\nhad said several times severely to my kitten (which is\ngrey and white) that it was obvious to me, judging from\nits deplorable condition, that it had spent some time\nin the coal shed.\nXXVI.\nExtract from Miss Samuels's notes {received April 11, 1919).\nApril 10, 1919. 4.30 [a.m.].\nAn argument on the telephone re 2\/10. \u00a350 also is\nmentioned.\n\fLXXX.] Apparent Thought Transference. 157\nNote written by H.

The Purpose, has occurred\nwith another correspondent, Miss F., of Watford (full name and address\nknown to the Society). Miss F. has had other experiences which\nsuggest, so far as they go, the telepathic acquisition of information\nfrom me, emerging, for the most part, not, as in the case of Miss\nSamuels, in dreams, but in waking hallucinations (apparitions of me).\nThe references corresponding with The Purpose, however, occurred, as\nwith Miss Samuels, in the course of an ordinary letter, suggesting\nnothing supernormal on its face, but which reached me, again as in\nthe case of Miss Samuels, at a time when I had reason to think Miss F.\nwould shortly read that book, because I knew it to be in the hands\nof a mutual friend, from whom I expected her to borrow it. The\ncorresponding passages are as follows :\nExtract from letter fro7n Miss F. to H.

I do hope you won't mind me\nwriting like this and I don't suppose you'll agree with me in\nmy views.

I had not\nmentioned my views of '\nWuthering Heights '\nto her, and I have\nno recollection of speaking on the subject of the Brontes at all.\nShe insists that she had not read the passage in '\nThe Purpose\n'\nor even glanced at it.\nExtracts from ''The Purpose\" (pp. 248-51).\nOne of the greatest artists who has lived, in my view, was\nEmily Bronte.

[part\nXXVIII.\nThe following is an instance of apparent thought-\ntransference from another agent. I quote it because of the\nunusual feature it contains in the indication of the verbal\ntransmission of a thought\u2014because, in other words, the\nagent, without consciousness of his act, appears to have\nsucceeded in the task of \"getting a name through.\"\nWhen I called on Miss Samuels on August 9, 1918, she\ngave me a slip of paper containing notes roughly jotted\ndown. These, she said, were the notes she had made\nof her impressions of the previous morning, and added\nthat she had sent a copy of them to Mr. Fuller in Ireland\nfor his comments. (I am giving the facts from my\ncontemporary note.) The paper was headed \"8\/8\/18,\"\nand the first note was as follows (I transcribe from the\noriginal document) :\nill\nnauseaum\nele\nMy contemporary note proceeds :\nShe [Miss Samuels] told me orally, when she gave me\nthe notes, that the first phrase\u2014which she pronounced\n\" il nauseam \"\n\u2014was sounding in her ears when she woke,\nthat she imagined it to be Italian, but that she had\nno knowledge of languages.\nrough characters harmonize perfectly with the rough Yorkshire\nmoors and are their complement. . . .\nThere is a glamour resting on that book and its author which\nappeals to me almost more than anything in the history of\nliterature. . . . She wrote Wuthering Heights when she was twenty-\neight and died at thirty. . . . Charlotte was afraid of Wuthering\nHeights ; she shuddered at the nightly readings. . . . This is\nto suggest nothing in disparagement of the author of Jane Eyre\nand her wonderful gifts. [A passage appreciative of Jane Eyre.]\nOne can perceive that enthusiastically, and yet place Emily .\nas far above Charlotte as Charlotte was above Anne.\nBoth this case and that given in the text are, of course, evidentially\nweak, because of the impossibility of proving that my correspondents\nhad not read The Purpose or any part of it; but the independent\noccurrence of these parallel incidents, each in connection mth a person\nwhom there is other reason to consider possessed of telepathic percep-\ntivity, is, I think, at least a suggestive coincidence.\n\fLxxx.j Apparent Thought Transference. 161\nShe told me, too, I remember, that the duplication of\nthe first word was due to alternative attempts on her part\nto reproduce the sound in 'writing.\nI called again on Miss Samuels on August 14, when\nshe gave me a letter which she told me she had received that\nmorning from Mr. Fuller and also an envelope, bearing her\nprinted address, which she said had enclosed it. The envelope\nbore the postmark :\n[Undecipherable word] Camp. 12 Aug. 18.\nThe following is an extract from the letter :\n[Mr. FuUer's fuU address] Curragh, Ireland.\nMonday noon [12th August, 1918].\n. . . Perhaps the strangest experience we have yet had\nis that connected with the two words you have quoted,\nthe actual spelling as I saw it was IL NAUSEAUM ; these\nwords I saw written in thick blue pencil in printed letters\nas I have put them, on white paper and stuck up on\na waU on the edge of the camp. I don't know whether\nI have ever told you, but if I come across words I cannot\nunderstand, I keep repeating them to myself, as you\nremark you kept repeatiiag them. These words evidently\nare not Latin, nor French ; at all events I have never\ncome across them before ; if French I should feel disposed\nto translate them as \"It is nauseating \" or as we might\nsay, \"It is sickening.\" Now what do they mean and\nwho could have pasted them up in the Curragh and\nwhy. ... H. H. Fuller.\nThe omitted portion of the letter is mainly comment\non other items in Miss Samuels's notes. In these, though\nMr. Fuller finds correspondence with his thoughts, he\npoints out confusion and discrepancies. I cite one of\nthese matters, as relevant to the question of the good\nfaith of the witnesses. Among the notes on the paper\nhanded to me by Miss Samuels on August 9 was the\nfollowing :\nbowl or bath vdth deep cover.\nMr FuUer's comment on that was as follows :\n\fPi\nt'\n'I\n162 Hubert Wales. [part\nThe deep bowl I cannot trace, unless it is the baths\nwe have here ;\nthey are rather primitive and have wooden\ncovers. H\nI judge from the form of this comment that, in the\ncopy of her notes sent to him by Miss Samuels, the\nwords \" or bath \" were omitted.\nI wrote to Mr. Fuller, asking him if he felt quite clear\nthat he had not mentioned the words \" il nauseaum \" to\n'\nMiss Samuels at any time before August 8, and if he i\ncould obtain corroborative testimony to his seeing them.\nThe following is an extract from his reply, dated August\n25, 1918 :\nNow to reply to your two queries, firstly, \" II nauseaum.\"\n'\nI am confident that these words were not sent to Miss |\nSamuels, as a matter of fact they must have been written i\nby her to me on the day following the evening on which i\nI saw them ; I did not write them until I replied to i\ni\nthat letter and corrected the spelling. The words puzzled !\nme for an hour or two and were then dismissed from my t\nmind, I gave them no further thought until I received\nher letter, then went round to make sure of the spelling\n;\nbut the paper had been removed either by human agency I\nor the rain the latter I fancy, as the night had been\na very wet one. Unfortunately I was quite alone when f\nI came across them, and, as I say, gave no further thought\nto them untU the arrival of Miss Samuels' letter.\nThe manifest weakness of this remarkable case is that\nit rests upon the bo7ia fides of Miss Samuels and Mr.\nFuller, who were practically strangers to me. The whole j\nthing might have been prepared for me.

For my i\npart, I feel satisfied, after allowing for the large admixture 1\n\fLxxx.] Apparent Thought Transjermce. 163\nof irrelevant matter, that all the correspondences recorded\nabove cannot reasonably be referred to chance. Call\nit telepathy or what you will, there seems to me to have\nbeen acquisition of knowledge by some means other\nthan the sensory channels of common experience. For\nthose who may be of the same opinion, I propose to\nrelate next some cases which, assuming a telepathic\nconnection, seem as if they might be of interest to examine\non other grounds.\nBefore proceeding to do so, I may perhaps make a\nfew general remarks.\nAlthough she recognises that willing or concentration\nby the agent are ineffective in her case. Miss Samuels\nis impressed by the popular view that telepathic com-\nmunication is conditioned or facilitated in some way\nby the agent directing his thoughts upon her ; and she\nhas been fruitful of suggestions as to how I might think\nof things \" in connection with\" her. After repeated\nexperiments, however, I have come to the conclusion that\nwhether I think of things \" in connection with \" her or\nthink of her at all has practically no influence on the\nresults. In many of the most striking cases, I think\nin the majority, the correspondences have concerned\nmatters which have affected my mind without the remotest\nconscious thought of Miss Samuels. In other words, the\nsubjects of her veridical notes have nearly always been\nunexpected by me.^ Even the \" black evening dress\ncut low,\"' though I had told my niece facetiously that I\nanticipated it, took me by surprise when it came ; and\nthe \" black, heavy, childlike handwriting,'' although, as\nwill have been seen, correct to the smallest detail, set\n^ The following is an exception, though the coincidence is not strong\nenough to exclude chance. On October 22, 1918, I made the following\nnote :\n\" Thought of B.

I can recollect no other allusion to a sheep in Miss Samuels's\nnotes, but there have been many to dogs.

[part\nme vaguely wondering, for a time, if I knew any writing\nlike it. On the other hand, there have been things\nwhich I have hoped Miss Samuels would get\u2014to which\nmy thoughts have turned again and again with that\nhope\u2014which she has not got or got anything at all\nresembling. I remember, among others, an incident of a\nmongoose and an incident of a gramophone. After\nthese eight months of observation and analysis, I cannot\nput my finger on any cause or condition which appears\nto have an influence on the selection of one thought\nrather than another for transference. It seems almost\nas if some mind other than my conscious mind chose\nthe subjects, chose with evidential requirements steadily\nin view, and chose, on the whole, from that standpoint,\nremarkably well.^ I can tell no more what, from out\nmy stock of thoughts and memories, is likely to find a\nplace in Miss Samuels's notes than I can tell what is\nlikely to find a place in my remembered dreams. Indeed,\nmany of her impressions in sleep as related by her might\nhave been my own dreams.\nDuring the whole period, however\u2014in the course of\nwhich I have received many hundreds of notes\u2014I have\nnot noticed a single instance of correspondence with\none of my dreams, though I am a prolific dreamer and\noften retain a very fair recollection of dream incidents\nfor a day or two, or longer.^ There have been one\nor two correspondences with those comparatively rare\nvivid visual images or auditory impressions one is liable\nto get in a somnolent state, usually, in my case, just\nafter waking.

When Mr. Wales first tries to make\nme see him he is alone the room is dark except for the\nUght shining straight in his face. ... I enjoyed my\nvisit to Mr. Wales' house very much and admired the\ndraped things. I shook hands with Mr. Wales on leaving\nbut not anyone else in the room.\nThe notes for this date also contain the reference to\nEarl's Court Road (Case V.).\nIt is more convenient in this case to use my con-\ntemporary note as a guide to the facts, instead of quoting\nit verbatim. I will deal first with the features suggesting\ntelepathy. On September 30, on entering a room, I\ndisturbed my wife, who, unknown to me, was resting\nthere on a sofa. The table lamp in my study has\na green shade\u2014the only shade in the room. I spend\nmost of my time in this room and am usually alone.\nAfter dark the only light I use is this small electric\ntable lamp on my desk. When people enter the room\nI have difficulty in seeing them at first, because the\nhght (which is between the door and me) shines straight\nin my face. The plan enclosed by Miss Samuels shows\nthe position of seven objects. Of these, five\n\u2014\" door,\"\n\" sofa,\" \" fireplace,\" \" tall backed chair \" and \" window \"\u2014\ncorrespond with such objects in my drawing-room and\nare placed in the right relative positions. The \" tall\nbacked chair \" is conspicuously right. The remaining\ntwo are a \" desk,\" placed behind the sofa, where there\nis, in fact, a cabinet, and a \" settee,\" placed in a position\nwhere there is an easy chair. (See plan of the room repro-\nduced.) It is not a back room, but it is back in relation\nto my study. The window corresponding with that in\nMiss Samuels's sketch plan looks out at the back, but\nthe room contains another window. It is small for\na drawing-room (18 by 16 ft.), certainly small for a\n\" reception \" such as Miss Samuels indicates. We had\n\f176 Hubert Wales. [PAET\n\fLxxx.] Apparent Thought Transfere7ice. 177\nhad no reception, however, or anything of the kind ;\nbut Miss Samuels's description of two of the people of\nher visionary reception correspond, so far as they go,\nwith two visitors who, about this time, had come on\nseparate occasions to tea. The first, who came abovit a\nweek before the date of Miss Samuels's impression, was a\nwoman who was working on the land, and who talked\na good deal about her nails and how she managed to\ncare for them. I can remember her holding up her\nhands and looking at her nails as she spoke. They were\nnot pointed\u2014on the contrary, she said that she kept\nthem short\u2014but the mention of nails inevitably sends\nmy thoughts to a woman I used to know who cut her\nnails to sharp, inelegant points. It is the case that,\nfor some reason, I did not much take to the woman\nwho talked of her nails, and I was quite conscious of\nthis at the time. The second visitor came on the day\npreceding the date of Miss Samuels's note\u2014that is, on\nOctober 1, 1918. She is a plain woman, but a particvilarly\nnice one. That is not, of course, an unusual combination,\nbut in this case it was the subject of conversation both\nbefore and after her visit, there were references to the\nsuperficial judgment of men (she is unmarried) and so\non. About ten days before the date of the impression\nI showed a third visitor (this time one staying in the\nhouse) photographs of Miss Samuels and Mr. Fuller,\ndeliberately withholding a second photograph of Miss\nSamuels. It will be seen that the only unity of these\nvarious visits and incidents (which all took place in the\ndrawing-room) is that provided by the retrospective\nvision of my mind. I have no particular association\nwith the Haymarket, beyond that it forms part of the\naddress of a firm of publishers with whom I have had\na business connection for about fifteen years, and, except-\ning occasional walks there, none with Regents Park. The\nimpression of light draperies is conspicuously wrong as\nregards the drawing-room ; the main articles of furniture\nin that room are covered with dark purple velvet and the\ncurtains are of plain shades of lighter purple. There\nis nothing in the least oriental about it. The \" small\n\f178 Hubert Wales. [part\nelderly man \" and the man-servant suggested nothing\nto me.\nI now come to the features of the vision which appear\nto have been suggested by Miss Samuels's normal memories.\nI . told her, briefly and generally, the extent to which\nher impression corresponded with matters in my thoughts.\nI fear she was disappointed that I could not tell her\nshe had described, literally and exactly, an actual occur-\nrence ; but on October 13, having probably been thinking\nabout the matter in the meantime, she wrote :\nThe little old man belongs to me. As you will note,\nI state \" my sister now seems to be with me a man-\nservant shows us out,\" etc. That is a memory from\nher or from myself as we were together. . . He is a\nvery rich relation of ours, who we do not know very\nwell, and when war broke out [I went to see him]. He\ndoes keep a tall man-servant or did in 1915.^\nOne is tempted by this case to the speculation that\nMiss Samuels's subliminal consciousness, having received\na telepathic impact, produced a picture of the relative's\nroom, as the closest approximation, available in her\nstock of memories, to the arrangements of my drawing-\nroom ; and hence, perhaps, the mistakes, not only about\nthe little old man and the man-servant, but also about\nthe light draperies and the misplaced articles of furniture.\nI feel pretty sure, at least, from my observations, that Miss\nSamuels can get an impression of nothing that is quite\nnew to her, quite foreign to her knowledge and thoughts.^\n^ Miss Samxiels told me in later letters (April 26 and April 28, 1919)\nthat he lives in Hay Hill\u2014which possibly suggested Haymarket-\u2014and\nthat many years previously the family had lived in Portland Place,\nwhich is, of course (as Miss Samuels knows) close to Regents Park.\n2 This has its countei-part, I think, in svipraliminal action. I, at\nleast, find, when writing fiction, that I always have in mind some\nroom (or other place, as the case may be, but usually a room) I have\nknown. I cannot produce and sustain a sheerly invented mental\npicture. No doubt, for purposes of description, I could deliberately\nand by effort set up in my mind a kind of architect's plan of a strange\nroom, as a dramatist does of a stage, but that would hold only while\nI was actually concentrating on description ; as soon as I proceeded\nto the action of the story, a room known to me would inevitably\nbe presented to my mind's eye as the scene of it.\n\fLXXX.] Apparent Thought.

JVIiss Samuels,\ndoubtless, has little or no knowledge of C4reek history\nand literature ; but she has attended an art school,\nand so it is not surprising to find that references to\n\" draped figures \" and so on come out with facility.\nXXXVII.\nAnother instance of this apparent inabilit}^ to obtain\nimpressions of anything alien to her experience is the\nfollowing.\nThe structure of the house I occupy is unusual : it\nis built all on one floor, extending, as its name suggests,\nover a long piece of ground, and the rooms have no\nceilings but are open to the rafters. Miss Samuels's\nnotes have never specifically referred to thsse peculiarities\n\u2014it is extremely probable that she has no knowledge\nof any house of the same type\u2014but those for March 21,\n1919, contained the following significant item :\nInspect old rambling barn or house, everything to be\ncleared out, except Landlord's fixtures, such as old-\nfashioned fireplaces etc.\nIt will be seen that, although, in writing her note,\nJ Miss Samuels uses the word barn \"'\n(apparently the\nnearest she could get, through her normal knowledge,\nto the kind of building she wished to describe) the\nreference to \" old-fashioned fireplaces \" indicates that\nsome part of her knew that it was not a barn.\nThe next day, March 22, 1919, produced the following :\nAnd a very vague remembrance of being in an old\nhouse again in a bad state of repair.\nThe \" again \" evidently comiects this with the impression\nof the previous day, so she definitely commits herself\nto a house and abandons the barn. The reference to\n\" a bad state of repair \" is relevant. The house has\nbeen much on my mind of late, as we have unexpectedly\n(on March 5, 1919) received notice to leave it in September.\nI have been asked to buy it ; its bad state of repair,\n\f180 Hubert Wales.

Since\nthey are very much together, are both foreign and both\nyoung and good looking, I necessarily associate them in\nmy mind.

On\nOctober 7, 1918, however, I received through Miss\nSamuels a letter from a friend of hers. Miss C.

The letter, which was dated October\n5, 1918, is as follows :\nDear Mr Wales, Miss Samuels has just been showing\nme some of her notes, and strangely enough about a train\nbound for Southampton, on which an elderly lady and\nmyself were travelling. We had to get into the end\nof this train because part of it was being left at Win-\nchester, and two gentlemen saw us off, taking 2 platform\ntickets, making 4. But somehow I lost my ticket and\nonly had [a] 10\/- note, so we had a quarrel with the\nporter. He ended by taking my address as I refused\nto pay. We were also worried as my friend had a lot\nof luggage, a dressing-case containing all her jewellery,\nand we had to leave it in the cloak room.\nI wrote to Miss Thorpe, asking her if she could re-\nmember the date or approximate date of the train inci-\ndent. The following is an extract from her reply, dated\nOctober 27, 1918, received October 29, 1918 :\n\fLXXX.] Apparent Thought Transference. 191\nDear Mr Wales, Thank you so much for your letter.\nYes, I think I can give you the exact date, as I was on\nleave, it was the 20th September, I was on my way to\nWinchester where my people live and have to travel on a\nSouthampton train.\n^\nSince Miss Thorpe was travelling to Winchester, where\na part of the train was slipped, she would evidently\nhave to change into the back, not the front, end of\nthe train. It will be seen that, in her first letter, she\ndoes not state which end it was ; and the presumption\nis that this omission was due to the fact that she was\nnot able to state that it was the front end. I refer to\nthis point because it appears to bear on the question\nof bona fides. Had the statement been a concoction,\nor an exaggeration of a slight coincidence, there would\nhave been no apparent reason why she should not have\nmade the correspondence exact ; but the letters, I think,\nindicate the natural desire of an honest witness, while\nkeeping within the bounds of fact, to make the most\nof the hits and the least of the misses. It is worth\nnoting, too, in this connection, that though Miss Samuels\nappears to have shown a number of her sets of notes,\non the 5th of October and later, to Miss Thorpe, the\nlatter claimed correspondence with her thoughts only\nin the cases of the Southampton train and some small\nundistinctive references such as \"a stopped up pipe.\"\nXLVIII.\nThe following case not only points to casual agency,\nbut suggests, like the laughter incident (Case VI.) and\nsome others not quoted, that thoughts may be trans-\nmitted which the agent does not wish to send. In\nthis instance, for obvious reasons, I substitute pseu-\ndonyms for the real names.\n1 This letter was received direct from Miss Thorpe\u2014not through\nMiss Samuels\u2014and was headed with the Chelsea address to which\n1 had written.\n\f192 Hubert Wales. [part\nMiss Samuels's yiotes [received September 2, 1918.\n6.30 a.m. August 31, 1918. Bouknemouth.\nI feel like a girl who has met a tall unpleasant slopioy\nkind of man and is only thinking how I can get away\nfrom him, before he annoys me by perhaps trying to\nkiss me.\n(There was no other note on this day.)\nMiss Samuels told me, when she sent the above, that\nshe thought the impression came from a young friend\nof hers, Miss Ray Peveril, a girl of about 16 ;\nthat,\nupon her return to London, she had asked her if she\nhad had any corresponding experience ; but that Miss\nPeveril had replied that she had not. A few days later,\nhowever, on the 7th of September, I received the follow-\ning letter from Mrs. Holbrook, a friend of Miss Peveril\nand also of Miss Samviels, dated 6th September, 1918 :\nMiss Samuels has just asked me to write about the\nman wanting to Idss a gnl, the tall man, she had the\ntelepathy while in Bournemouth. Miss [Peveril] told\nme about the incident, but when Miss Samuels asked\nher about it she would not admit it at all, as Miss Samuels\nhad told her not to fhrt. But I think you ought to\nknow when things are correct. Miss [Peveril] will often\ntell me things she would not like to tell Miss Samuels.\nIn a letter bearing the same date as the above Miss\nSamuels wrote :\nYou will have a httle letter from Mi-s [Holbrook] about\nthat tall man who frightened [Ray] while I was at Bourne-\nmouth. He did try to kias her but she would not admit\nit to me, but she did to Mrs [Holbrook]. So without\ntelling the gii'l we are telling you, to clear up the point.\nThere is a manifest suggestion here, as elsewhere, of\nthe absence of inhibitory power in the subliminal strata,^\nor at least of failure always to exert it, whether we\nregard the agent as impressing the percipient, or the\npercipient as reading the thoughts of the agent. One\n1 A case strongly suggesting such an absence of inhibitory power is\nrecorded in the Journal for March, 1920, pp. 174-5.\n\fLxxx.] Apparent Thought Transference. 193\nor two cases, which I cannot relate privately, far less\npublish, appear to indicate that even the most personal\nand secret thoughts of our intimate lives are not immune\nfrom transference telepathically.\nMost people, I find, are rather startled by the sugges-\ntion that there are latent powers in us, which, if they\nbecome universal, would deprive us of the ability we\nhave hitherto enjoyed to keep certain things to our-\nselves. It seems to me that that feeling is based on some\nmisconception of what such a state of general mind\nreading, if in course of time it is to be developed, would\nimply. It would put a premium on sincerity. Your\nneighbour would know your affairs, but you would know\nhis, and your knowledge would be your defence. Only\nhypocrites, as it appears to me, have any serious reason\nto fear the approach of the day, if it is to come, \" when\nthe secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed.\"\nOn the whole, however, I feel inclined to infer from\nthese incidents\u2014what most people must have inferred\nfrom a consideration of the phenomena of professional\nmediums\u2014that the subliminal knows the supraliminal's\nbusiness. In this case my business was to obtain evi-\ndence about telepathy, evidence of its u.tmost reach and\npower. Had my subliminal consciousness known that,\nin the interests of obtaining that evidence, I should be\nwilling to be placed personally in a disconcerting position,\nit would have known no more than the truth. Similarly\nMiss Peveril, at the bottom of her heart, might have\nhad some motive for desiring the disclosure of the informa-\ntion contained in Miss Samuels's note.\nMiss Samuels has told me repeatedly that she receives\nwhat she regards as telepathic impressions from her\nnear relatives, with whom she lives and who to a large\nextent share her thoughts ; but since she appreciates that\nit would be almost impossible to make these evidentially\ncogent, she does not send me notes of them.\nEvidence of the possible agency of total strangers\nis necessarily difficult to obtain. Indeed, there would\nappear to be no way of obtaining it except by chance\n\f194 Hubert Wales. [part\nor the concurrence of some public event. The two\nfollowing cases seem just worth quoting in this connec-\ntion, though it will be manifest that, at the most, they\nonly hint at the possibility of such a wide telepathic\nsweep.\nXLIX.\nExtract from Miss Samtiels's notes {received August 27, 1918).\n26th August, 1918.\nI now remember that I hear people talking about the\nwar, that some big operation is taking place in Egjrpt.\nThe date is important.

(Other instances of this included\nin this paper are XXVI. and XLIII. above.)\nMy contemporary note on this name seems over long\nfor the occasion, so I do not quote it in full. It\nstates (giving instances of specific thoughts) that, for\nsome days just previous to the date of Miss Samuels's\nnote I had been thinking much about Mrs. Willett's\nscript, puzzling particularly over the difiiculty involved\nin the confusion of the greater and lesser Ajax [Pro-\nceedings, Part LXIII., p. 168), indicating, as it does, on\nthe one hand, a mistake too gross to be attributed to the\npurporting communicator, and, on the other, too much\nclassical knowledge to be attributed to Mrs. Willett herseK.\nPossibly this very set of notes, pointing to the receipt of\ninformation telepathically from a variety of sources, may\ncontribute something to the solution of the problem.^\n1 References to trains and railways are very common in Miss Samuels's\nnotes, occurring considerably oftener, probably, than those to any other\nsubject. The next favourite topic is, perhaps, jewellery and finery\ngenerally, particularly pearls.\n2 In connection with my contemporary note to this case there occurred\na good, and rather amusing, instance of the untrustworthiness of memory\neven for a week. I stated in the note, without the smallest suspicion\nthat I was saying anything but the exact and literal truth, that a few\ndays earlier I had written Miss Samuels \" a long letter \" upon the subject\nof The Baptism of Statins \" and \" The Ear of Dionysius \" cases, but\nhad not mentioned the name of the mediiun. Subsequently it\noccurred to me that the best evidence of this would be the letter\nitself, so I wrote and asked Miss Samuels to return it to me. She sent\nme all my recent letters, and, with some difficulty, I found among them\nthe one I wanted. It was a postcard. The date it bore was 16 Sep.\n1918, exactly a week before the date of the note. It was the case\nthat it did not mention the name of Mrs. Willett.\n\fHubert Wales. [p^^t\nMiss Samuels told me upon enquiry\u2014and I have no\ndifficulty in accepting her statement\u2014that she had never\nheard of Mrs. Willett.\n(3) Miss .Samuels wrote to me on October 5, 1918 :\n\"\nMiss\nThorpe is an ambulance driver, and saw the Red Cross\ntram arrive.\" On October 29, 1918, I received a letter\nfrom Miss Thorpe dated from an \" A.I.F.

W. {received\nthrough Miss Satnuels, September 22, 1918).\nMiss Samuels has just shown me her notes of September\n21, 1918, and the last one about powdering I think\nis to do with me. On Tuesday last [September 17.\n1918] I distinctly remember powdering my neck as it\nwas very brown owing to the sun. Last night I looked\nfor the powder box but could not find it.\nSince this item is not included in the original\nnotes, It must be understood that, as happened in another\niFor another incident suggesting the influence of two agents upon\none impression see Case XII., footnote.\n\fLXXX.] Apparent Thought Transference. 199\ncase\/ it was possible for it to have been inserted after\nMiss Samuels had heard Miss Howard's story. But of\ncourse no stress is laid upon this trivial correspondence,\nconsidered individually.\n(6) (7) I much regret, in view of the special interest\nof the set of notes as a whole (which of course was\nnot apparent to me at the time) that these two, owing to\nan oversight (Miss Samuels had omitted them from her\ntyped copy), were not sent to IMr. Fuller. He returned\nthe remainder without comment. Had the full notes\nbeen sent to him, it would have been most exceptional\nhad he noted no correspondence with these bodily\nsensations. Attributing them to him, it will be noticed\nthat the impressions from the four apparent agents con-\ncerned emerge in sequence, those attributed to Mr. Fuller,\nthough last in the notes, being first in order of time.\n\"Rapport\" Objects.\nI have tried two experiments of sending \"rapport\" objects\nto Miss Samuels. On the whole, the results were negative.^\nMistakes Resembling Mishearing.\nThere have been a few incidents, in the course of the\nobservations, that have oddly suggested mishearing. For\ninstance, on one occasion, September 24, 1918, Miss\nSamuels's notes contained, \" Vinegar is good to clean a\nlong sword.\" Had the last word been \" saw \" instead of\n\" sword,\" this, absurd as it seems, would have been\nquite appropriate to certain trivial circumstances affecting\nmy mind at the time. Again, on November 21, 1918,\nthe notes contained, \" Winnie, William.\" \" Winnie \" was,\nand is, meaningless to me. Had it been Willie,\" the\ntwo names would have been highly relevant ;\nmore so,\nperhaps, than any two that could have been given.\n1 See above, Case XXIX.\n- Miss Samuels had no faith whatever in the efficacy of these articles\nin her own case, and so far misconstrued my object in sending them\nas to attempt to forward one of them to a public medium. Fortunately\nshe was unable to carry out that project, since it appeared that the\n\" mediimi \" concerned had temporarily retired from business, on the\nadvice of the police. \u2022\n\f200 Hubert Wales. [part\nWith agent and percipient separated by forty miles,\nthere can evidently be no question of involuntary whisper-\ning ;\nso that, if these cases are not due to chance, they\nseem to require the hypothesis that Miss Samuels's supra-\nliminal consciousness can mishear, or appear to mishear,\nher subliminal.\nThat something in the nature of mishearing between\nstrata of consciousness may occur, I feel pretty sure\nfrom my own slight experience of sensory automatism.\nI have a distinct recollection, upon one occasion, of\nmishearing the word \" hope \" for \" propose \" and having\nit corrected. I wanted the word to be \" propose \" and\ntried to make it \" propose \"\u2014it was concerned with\nthe producing of evidence of identity\u2014and I still retain\na vivid impression of the firm, somewhat admonitory,\ntone in which was repeated the words, \" which we ho'pe\nto give you.\"\nPerhaps I may add that it never was given. And I\nhave since come to feel that, in withholding it (pre-\nsuming it could have been obtained) my providential\nguardian\u2014which in this case, at least, was clearly my\nsubliminal self\u2014did me a considerable service. For, had\nevidence been forthcoming which suggested the identity\nof some discarnate mind, I should probably have found\nit difficult afterwards to bring an unbiassed judgment\nto bear upon the question of the nature of these per-\nsonalities of automatic states. At present I can see\nno reason to regard them, wherever they occur, however\nlifelike and seemingly independent they may be\u2014and\nwhether or not there be at times a telepathic agent,\nincarnate or discarnate, conscious or unconscious, in the\nbackground\u2014as other than the creations of this same\ninexhaustibly fertile underlying self.^\nApparent Premonitory Im.pressions.\nI referred in the early part of this paper to certain of\nMiss Samuels's veridical impressions that were antecedent\n^ By this I do not suggest an indefinite number of secondary per-\nsonalities, but characters built up subliminally, as a novelist builds up\ncharacters supraliminally.\n\fLxxx.] Apparent Thought Transference. 201\nin time.

[part\nChu Chin Chow \" (together with Miss Samuels's dated\nnote, endorsed by me with the date of receipt) can be\nseen at the rooms of the Society ; it is too large to\nreproduce here.\nI ought to say, perhaps, that, when I embarked on\nthese observations, I did not anticipate getting such\ncorrespondences as are set out in the above table ;\nindeed,\nmy mind was so strongly set against anything suggestive\nof precognition, that for some time I made only rough\npencil notes of these incidents. I regarded the whole\nsubject with suspicion, it seemed to me to owe its\nbeing to the popular demand for fortune telling, and\nI could hardly read anything about it with patience.\nI felt that to obtain knowledge of the future, except\nin so far as it could be inferred from the present, was\nimpossible, whatever supernormal powers or agencies one\nwas prepared to postulate ; and metaphysical arguments\nabout the reality of time found in my mind a most\nunreceptive soil. If such a personal confession be of\nany interest, I will frankly admit that I have been\nshaken somewhat (though not dislodged) by the number\nof missiles of the kind shown in the table with which\nMiss Samuels has bombarded me.\nAnalysis of the cases above recorded, however, reveals\nthat many of them, perhaps most\u2014even if the coincidences\nappear too close to be attributed to chance\u2014may be\nexplained, by one means or another, without invoking\nprevision. Some of these routes of escape may seem\nto us tortuous and uninviting ; but the question to be\nconsidered is whether, even so, they do not demand less\nstrain upon probability than does the supposition that,\nin any circumstances or by any agency, things which\nother facts do not enable us to anticipate can be known\nbefore they have taken place.\nConsider, for example, the third item\u2014the Frenchman's\nletter. It wiU be seen that, at the date of Miss Samuels's\nnote, this letter had been written and probably posted,\nthough it had not then reached me. It is, therefore,\npossible to suppose, if we accept telepathy at all, that\nMiss Samuels had received by this means, news of its\n\fLxxx.] Apparent Thought Transference. 207\ndespatch from my French friend, either direct or via\nthe trans-marginal regions of my mind. And we can\nresort to a similar hypothesis in Case 9 : for Dr. Selwyn's\ndeath (which, I learn upon enquiry, occurred on the\n8th of November) took place a few hours before Miss\nSamuels wrote her note, though I did not hear of it\nuntil a day later. In this instance, however, since I\nwas not personally acquainted with Dr. Selwyn or any\nof his family, it can hardly be supposed that I acted\nas a connecting link, or mutual point of rapport, between\none or more of them and Miss Samuels. Furthermore,\nwe are left with a small unexplained residuum in the\nmatter of the suddenness of the news (though, no doubt,\nmost announcements of death are almost necessarily\nsudden) and the general circumstance that the stress of\nMiss Samuels's note seems to be laid, less on the death,\nthan on the hearing of it.\nNext, consider the incidents of the step-ladder and the\nrose-bush (8 and 10). In these cases, the fulfilment\nof the prophecy (so to put it) rested upon action on my\npart ; so again we have open to us an emergency exit\nfrom the hypothesis of precognition. Miss Samuels^ it\nmay be urged, having obtained, during the coui'gj,^ of\nthese experiments, a close knowledge of my ge^xeral\nactivities and thoughts, armounced in advance actions,\nwhich she either knew I was likely to perform or sub-\nsequently (but before her notes could arrive) caused me\nto perform by telepathic suggestion\u2014the whole process\nbeing subliminal.\nEven in the case of the van-load of chorus girls (13),\na path can be found to lead us at least part of the\nway out of our difficulty. This coincidence, I may perhaps\nsay parenthetically, was to me the most impressive of\nthose which suggest, prima facie, a knowledge of the\nfuture. For the picture conjured up by Miss Samuels's\nnote seemed so preposterous, so fantastic, so removed,\nwith dreamlike inconsequence, from the world of sober\nfact, that I felt incUned to laugh at it, until, a few\ndays later, I was startled by seeing the reproductions\nof the photographs in a newspaper I had picked up.\n\f208 Hubert Wales. [part\nBut even here, as I have indicated, the material of\nthe corresponding details was not all in the future at\nthe time Miss Samuels wrote and posted her note. Doubt-\nless, there were numbers of people who, at that time\nknew all about the proposal to transport theatrical com-\npanies in costume, from the theatres to the ball, in\ncommercial vehicles of various kinds. It is necessary,\nhowever, frankly to recognise that this does not quite\nclear us ; since it is difficult to see how anyone can\nhave known before the night of 8th January, that, of\nthe many flashlight photographs of these proceedings\nwhich, no doubt, were taken, the two chosen for repro-\nduction and placed in contiguous positions, in, at least,\none newspaper, would represent a lorry-load of chorus\ngirls and the company of Chu Chin CJioiv.\nI will leave this subject by reminding Members of the\nSociety of a passage in Lord Rayleigh's Presidential Ad-\ndress :\n\" We live in times which are revolutionary in\nscience as well as in politics. Perhaps some of those\nwho accept extreme '\nrelativity ' views, reducing time to\nmerely one of the dimensions of a four-dimensional mani-\nfold may regard the future as differing from the past\nn than north differs from south \" (Proc, Pt. LXXVII\np.\n'\n1^.\nGeneral Conclusions.\nThe observations as a whole, considered in relation\nto other observations and to experiments in thought\ntransference, have suggested a hypothesis to my mind,\nwhich I tentatively put forward. It may have something\nm it or it may be quite unworthy of consideration.\nIt is this : that what we have been accustomed to call\ntelepathy may comprise two utterly distinct phenomena,\nas widely divided as the poles, indeed, far more widely.\nI mean, there may be a physical phenomenon\u2014some-\nthing, conceivably, in the nature of the popular \" brain\nwaves,\" carried by the ether\u2014operating over limited\ndistances and where there is no considerable material\nobstruction between the transmitting and receiving brains ;\n\fLxxx.] Apparent ThougJit Transference. 209\nand there may be also a psychical phenomenon\u2014requiring\nto contemplate the mind as existing .independently of\nthe organism and having a different relation to space from\nthe organism\u2014occurring in all conditions and circumstances,\nbut observable mainly where there is such distance or\nobstruction between agent and percipient as to exclude the\nphysical phenomenon.^ At any rate, one cannot help being\nstruck by the fact that, in the large number of experiments\nin thought transference at close quarters, reported in the\nProceedings, it has again and again been found that\nseparation of agent and percipient, by distance or material\nobstacles, has been followed by diminution or complete\ncessation of the success obtained when there was no\nsuch separation. It does not seem to me that theories\nof lack of confidence on the part of experimenters and\nso on can wholly and satisfactorily account for this.\nIt was particularly marked in the long series of experi-\nments with hypnotised subjects conducted by Mrs.\nSidgwick in 1889 and 1890. The results obtained, in\nthe course of those experiments, with agent and per-\ncipient in the same room, were very impressive ; with\nagent and percipient in adjoining rooms, success, though\nmuch diminished, persisted to a degree considerably\nbeyond what chance would have given, and so (as it\nseems to me) put out of court, as an explanation, the\ntheory of involuntary whispering or other sensory cause ;\nwith the experimenters more widely separated there was,\nto quote Mrs. Sidgwick's report {Proc, Vol. VIII., p. 547),\n\"practically no success,\" though \"nearly four hundred\n^ Since writing the above, I have discovered that a similar query\nwas propounded by Myers :\n\" Is there one and only one form of\ninfluence which is not communicated by the ordinary channels of\nsense ? Or is there an influence which is felt by a percipient only\nwhen the agent is very near him ? and another influence which the\npercipient feels equally when the agent is at an indefinite distance ? . . .\nSpeaking for myself only, I am inclined provisionally to accept the\nhypothesis that more than one form of force, or at least more than\none form of receptivity, is concerned in the phenomena\" {Proc, Vol. IV.,\np. 176). And, from a reference there given, the same point appears\nto be urged in Phantasms of the Living, which I had not read. Myers,\nhowever, does not seem disposed to draw any sharp distinction between\na psychical and a physical phenomenon, or even between mind and matter.\n\f210 Hubert Wales. [part\ntrials were made with Miss B. as percipient, and the\nagent or agents either in a different building or divide^\nfrom her by at least two closed doors and a passage.\"\nYet we find, in such cases as those above recorded, as\nthose obtained experimentally by Miss Miles and Miss\nRamsden, reported in Vols. XXI. and XXVII. of Pro-\nceedings, as those pointing to the inducement of hypnosis\nat a distance, as those noted in numerous experiments in\nhypnotic \" clairvoyance,\" and particularly as those common\nexperiences called shortly \"death coincidences,\" that the\nintervention neither of distance nor of innumerable ma-\nterial obstructions between agent and percipient appears\nto have the smallest influence of any kind upon the\ntransference of thought. To me, in the light of my\nown experiences and of those apparently allied to which\nI have referred, the impediment to success so frequently\nencountered when a single wall has divided the experi-\nmenters is, if we are dealing with the same phenomenon,\ninexplicable.^\nThe observations recorded in this paper have an evi-\ndent bearing upon the consideration of phenomena pur-\nporting to be communications from the dead. I do\nnot feel competent to discuss that aspect in any detail,\nsince I have never had a sitting with a medium\u2014to\nuse a question-begging word, but one difficult to avoid.\nAll I will venture to say is, that the unconscious or\nsubconscious telepathic agency indicated (especially if\nthe observations be confirmed by other observations, as\nthey are themselves confirmatory of certain observa-\ntions of crystal vision) manifestly offers an alternative\nexplanation, extending far beyond the range of telepathy\nfrom the sitter, of some at least of the phenomena which\ntake a spiritistic form. They appear, in particular, to\nmake it gratuitous to invoke the agency of discarnate\nI\nIt shoiild be pointed out, however, that, even at the closest quarters,\nif there were no sensory communication, the difficulty with regard to\na code, which Lord Rayleigh considered an objection to a physical\ntheory of telepathy more fundamental even than the failure to get\nattenuation with distance {Proc, Pt. LXXVII., p. 288) would still apply.\n\fLxxx.] Apparent Thought Transference. 211\nminds to account for knowledge of contemporary events\noccurring at a distance from the automatist, and, I think,\n(speaking of course from a strictly evidential point of\nview) of facts in the past, emerging as the memories\nof someone deceased, wheii they are all known to a single\nliving person.. I think, however, that the observations\nsuggest, equally clearly, that a percipient's power of\nutihzing knowledge extracted from the living may prove\nto have limits. I have found no trace of a capacity\nso to group information collected as to suggest the unity\nof any mind other than that of the apparent agent.\nIn saying that, I am thinking, of course, primarily\nof the mind of a dead person ; for had there been such\ngrouping as to suggest the mental unity of someone\nhving, one would naturally have regarded, that person\nas the agent. I have referred to a tendency for various\nallusions to matters relevant to a particular topic (as,\nfor instance, the memory of Paris) to occur for days\nand weeks, when that topic has been brought to the\nfront of my mind ; and if such specialized allusions were\nunmixed with other veridical matter, it might well be\nmade to appear that they emanated from a sharer of\nthe experiences, whether living or dead. I can recall,\nhowever, in the voluminous records of her impressions\nwhich Miss Samuels has sent me, no sustained isolation\nof notes corresponding with my memories associated with\na particvdar person ; and it should be pointed out, in\nregard to the Paris references, that, even if we extract\nthese from their setting and look at them by themselves,\nit is still the unity of my mind, not that of my French\nfriend, that is suggested : for he knew nothing, for\ninstance, of the Le Matin incident.\nI feel, too, that, in considering cross-correspondences,\ndue weight should be given to the indications, as I\nhave put it, that the subhminal knows the supraliminal's\nbusiness, and may be able and willing, when such is\nthe latent desire of the automatists or either of them, to\ntransmit messages telepathically in a form which suggests\nthe intervention and direction of a third mind. My\npersonal experiences of automatism, both motor and\n\f212 Hubert Wales. [part\nsensory, have inspired me, I confess, with a high respect\nfor the powers of the subliminal self ; and it seems\nparticularly to shine in artifices which insinuate the\naction of a discarnate intelligence. I do not feel, as\ndo some, that there is anything \" fiendish \" in subliminal\nactivity of that kind ; I am more disposed to see in\nit merely a reflection of the desire, probably latent in\nmost of us, whether we admit it or not, to find that\nthere is life after death.\nHaving touched upon this subject, I would like to\nsay, in conclusion, (though, in doing so, I feel I am only\nreiterating what has been better said by others) that,\nin spite of the inroad made upon the spiritistic inter-\npretation of certain mediumistic phenomena, the effect\nupon my mind of the observations I have recorded has\nbeen to make survival and communication seem more\nprobable than they previously seemed : because, by\nreinforcing the evidence already accumulated in favour\nof a psychical, as against a physical, theory of tele-\npathy, (1) they point to there being something in man\ncapable of intelligent action apart from the material\norganism, something unconfined by conditions of space\nand perhaps even by conditions of time, and (2) they\nindicate the practical possibihty of mind communicating\nwith mind independently of matter.\n\fLxxx.] Apparent Thought Transfereyice. 213\nAPPENDIX.\n(1) Cramp again\ncold water.\nfrom my\n(2) Not my pains, I was\nmassaging the right arm\nof a man who had sprained\nit.\nThe following list includes all references to bodily\nsensations in Miss Samuels's notes which I sent to Mr.\nFuller.

A Report on the Work\ndone in 1916-17 at the Harvard Psychological Laboratory, i\nunder the gift of Mrs. John Wallace Riddle and the\nHodgson Fund. By Leonaed Thompson Teoland, Albany,\nN.Y. Pp. 26.\nj\nOne can imagine that the '\nreaction '\nof an old-fashioned\npsychical researcher on a fu'st reading of this paper would\nbe Horatian, and would take the form of (1) Parturiunt\nmantes ! and (2) YanMcos odi, ^Jtier, apparatus ! but he would\nbe wrong if he did not thereupon continue his search for j\ngrains of sense amid masses of what may fauiy be caUed\nacademic chaff. For the S.P.R. ought certauily to have a\nlaboratory, and if it had one as good as that of Harvard\nUniversity, it would find that psychologists flocked to it, and\nthat its own reputation in the scientific world went up by\nleaps and bounds. Much allowance should, moreover, be\nmade for the conditions under which Dr. Troland laboured.\nYears ago Harvard had become the beneficiary of a '\nHodgson\nMemorial Fund,' since it is a principle of the management\nof every American university (as of the Catholic Church) to\ntake any endowment that is offered (even were it for the\npurpose of communicating with Mars !), and never to reject\nan endowment merely because it did not quite approve of\nits object or its terms.i But nothing in the way of Psychical\nResearch was done with the proceeds of the Fund until Mrs.\nRiddle gave a further sum in order to start research. Then\n^ As Oxford University did the Squire Law .Scdiobirsliips.\n\fLXXX.] Review. 219\nsomething had to be done, though possibly not without an\narriere pensee (as in the Seybert case in the University of\nPennsylvania and the Stanford case in California) that a\nnegative issue to the investigation would be more desirable\nthan the opposite, and would liberate the funds for academic-\nally more convenient purposes. At any rate Dr. Troland\nwas the first '\nresearcher '\nto be appointed, and as nothing\nmore appears to have been clone since 1916-7, the idea cannot\nbe entirely excluded that this Report is a huge joke ! At\nthe expense either of Psychical Research, or of experimental\npsychology. In the absence, however, of independent evidence\nthat Dr. Troland is jDossessed of the sense of humour and\naudacity to play such a trick, I dare not press this hyiDothesis,\nand must (with a little reluctance) review his Re23ort as\nintended to be serious.\nTaking it thus, the first difficulty one encounters is the\namount of its irrelevance, and the enormous disproportion\nbetween apparatus and achievement. (1) If we regard it as the\naim of his research to determine whether or not '\ntelepathy\n'\noccurs, and whether the alleged communication between\ntwo minds unable to do so by recognized methods can\nbe tested by apparatus which will indisputably exclude all\nvitiation by (a) fraud, (b) unconscious bias, the initial homily\non scientific method is irrelevant. If it were not, it would\nbe highly objectionable, as involving either the dogmatic\nassumption of a materialistic metaphysic, or a '\nbehaviori^\n'\nmethod of psychological experimentation, of disputable applica-\ntion, or both. As, however. Dr. Troland does not need the\nnotion of '\nthe reflex arc '\nto read off his instruments, his\nuse of it is simply irrelevant.\n(2) Having artificially ruled out any reference to psychic\nprocess in his version of psychological method, Dr. Troland\nproceeds to call the appeal made to it by those who do 7wf\nso rule it out, a '\nbreak '\nor '\ngap '\nin the physical series.\nOn his own showing this is indefensible. His method cannot\nrecognize any '\ninteraction '\nbetween psychical and physical,\nand therefore cannot recognize such 'gaps.' It can only look\nfor lihysical antecedents of physical events. So if it were\nexperimentally proved that the thoughts I was formulating\nin Oxford were being instantaneously recorded in New York\n\f220 F. C. S. Schiller. [PABT\nby Dr. Hyslop, the logical inference would be, not to 'tele-\npathy, '\nbut to some (unknown) physical connexion between\nus.i It would be Dr. Troland's duty to search Dr. Hyslop\nfor '\nwireless '\napparatus. Furthermore, his method gives him\nno right whatever to regard the two physical series occurring\nin our bodies as interrupted, and to connect them by a '\ngap.'\nFor there would be no '\ngap '\nin -mij thoughts and acts, which\nwould go on continuously after I had '\ntelepathed '\nto Dr.\nHyslop. Neither would there be a '\ngap '\nin his life, as he\nrecorded what Dr. Troland would subsequently discover to be\na '\ntelepathic '\nmessage. It is, therefore, purely arbitrary for\nDr. Troland to assume that he is dealing with a single '\nreflex\narc,' one-half of which is located in one body, and the other\nin another. Prima facie, what he is dealing with is a curious\ncoincidence, or (conceivably) an influence of one organism on\nanother. But if it be true that scientific method cannot\nrecognize any but physical processes, it follows necessarily\nthat this influence imist be mediated physically. And, of\ncourse, there is plenty of '\nether '\nto close all '\ngaps.' On\nthe other hand, if it is permissible in psychology to recognize\npsychic process, it can easily be interpolated between the\n'\nafferent '\nand the ' efferent '\nneural process, and we can\nattribute to it the function of choice between possible reactions.\nNor will it be more impossible in principle to conceive a\nmind as reacting on another brain than on its own.\n(3) The technical terminology Dr. Troland invents to lend\na cachet to his theory is amusing but irrelevant. Schizo-\nkinesis has a solemn sound, and the boldest would think\ntAvice before they exposed themselves to '\nafferent '\nor '\nefferent\n'\nSchizoneurosis. But one would have liked to have seen Dr.\nTroland hesitate, and use a little Humian criticism on himself,\nbefore he began to talk about \" the usual physical chain of\ncausation binding the central and motor processes with the\nobject \"\n(p. 6). For it is well to avoid the pitfaUs in the\nold philosophic terminology before plunging into innovations.\n(4) The elaborate description of Dr. Troland's apparatus,\ngood as it is, and great as is the credit it does to his in-\ngenuity, seems disproportionately long. The apparatus is no\ndoubt a great advance on any that was available before.\n1 This wa-s written before Dr. Hyslop's lamented demise.\n\fLXXX.] Review. 221\nHenceforth mechanical '\ntimers,' '\ncounters,' '\nstimulus-shufiflers\n'\nand '\ntotallers '\n(though not perhaps essential to successful\nexperimentation) ought to find a place in every well-equipped\npsychical laboratory. But Dr. Troland is so much taken up\nwith them that he quite forgets to give his readers a plain\naccount of how he actually experimented. We are told\nindeed that the two experimenters \" were seated in very\ncomfortable Morris chairs on opposite sides of a small table,\nthe distance separating their heads being about 6 feet. Both\nsubjects faced in the same direction. The experiments were\ncarried out in complete darkness, and a screen placed in the\ncentre of the table also served to shut off their view of each\nother. The room in which the work was done was heavily\ncarpeted, and was rendered sound-proof by double walls and\ndouble doors. The control mechanism was in another room\non the opposite side of the buUding,\" etc. (jjp. 21-2). . One\ngathers, though one is not told, that the experiment consisted\nin the agent's looking at a '\nstimulus-field ' on which a square\nwas electrically lighted up either on the right or on the left\nof an illumined circle, while the '\npercipient '\nmoved a '\nreaction\nkey '\nto the right or to the left, the agreement of two '\nrights\n'\nor lefts constituting the rightness, a disagreement the wrong-\nness, of the response. Presumably (though this is not stated)\nthe percipient could not possibly see the '\nstimulus-field.' On\nthis most vital and relevant point nothmg is said, any more\nthan on the psychic idiosyncrasies of the experimenters.\n(5) What did all this preparation lead up to ? In 605\nexperiments the direction of the stimulus and the reaction\nmovement coincided 284 times. The probable number being\nhaK of 605, there was actually a considerable deficiency in\nright responses ! As Dr. Troland says (p. 23), \" this would\nappear to be indicative of '\nnegative telepathy,' or in other\nwords, it would suggest that exposure of the stimulus to the\nagent prevented the percipient from making the right reaction\nin a certain number of cases. This is a kind of result\nwhich has little interest for the popular mind, because tele-\npathy is commonly supposed to increase the chances of a\ncorrect guess, instead of decreasing them. However, from\na coldly scientific point of view, '\npositive telepathy '\nis no\nmore interesting or probable than '\nnegative telepathy.' There\n\f222 F. C. S. Schiller. [part\nis not the slightest reason for rejecting a depression of coinci-\ndences below chance as non-significant, when an equal elevation\nabove chance figures would have been hailed as real evidence.\" He\nadmits that his '\ndepression '\nlies \" well within the range usually-\nallowed for chance 'fluctuations of sampling,' \" but calculates that\n\" the odds are about 14 to 1,\" that it is 7iot purely casual.\nUnfortunately he does not note how his anomaly was pro-\nduced. It was due to a heavy excess of failures (199 to\n155) in half his experiments, the '\n40-second ' series, in which\nthe agent was allowed only 15 seconds to perceive his stimulus.\nThe '\n80-second '\nseries, with the stimulus exposed for 30\nseconds, gave a slight excess of right reactions (129 to 120).\nAlso while it is true that all anomalies must be significant,\ntheir significance need not be the same. If the experimenters\nare both trying, a '\npositi\\^e '\nanomaly would mean that they\nwere succeeding, a '\nnegative '\nthat their very efi^ort was causing\nits own frustration. Hence (on the assumption always that\nthe psychic condition of the experimenters may make a differ-\nence), one might suggest that very short exposures were '\nfluster-\ning,' i.e. so disturbing as to tend to generate an '\nanxiety\nneurosis '\nand to inhibit the right reaction. On the other\nhand, long exposures might yield a difl^erent result and a\ndistinctly supernormal number of successes ; while at some\nintermediate length of exposure a series indistinguishable from\nchance might be obtained. Nevertheless all three series would\nreally tell in favour of telepathy. This is clearly one of\nmany lines of experiment that should be pursued.\nIn any case Dr. Troland's experiments, as they stand, prove\nlittle. He has obtained no conclusive results. That only\nmeans that 605 experiments between himself and Mr. Murphy,\nunder the conditions and with the method stated, yielded no\npositive evidence that either was interested in, or cognizant\nof, the contents of the other's '\nstimulus-field.' The reason\nmight only be that he had succeeded in maximizing the lack\nof human interest which renders psychological laboratory ex-\nperiments so woefully inadequate as clues to the normal be-\nhaviour of so emotional a being as the human soul.\nWe may grant, indeed, that he has devised apparatus which\nfacilitates the accurate recorcUng of conditions, the elimination\nof the researcher's personal equation, and the mathematical\n\fLXXX.] Review. 223\ncalculation of the chances. But he does not appear to have\nasked himself the important question, '\nWai my apparatus\nwork, with me, in the field for which it is designed ?\n'\nIf it\ndoesn't, little can be inferred. It may be that it was the\nwrong apparatus for the pm-pose ; or that it could be made\nto work by changing some of the many conditions involved.\nIt might be that the wrong persons were employed, and that\nboth the experimenters were congenitally devoid of '\ntelepathic\n'\nsensitiveness. Or, agam, it might be that no apparatus could\ncope with the subject. But of this there is no evidence.\nI should demur equally to Dr. Troland's exaggerated esti-\nmate of the aid of mathematics. He says (p. 25) that \" if\ndata cannot be presented in such form that they can be dis-\ncussed mathematically, they camaot furnish the basis of scientific\ngeneralizations.\" But mathematical treatment is neither the\nprimary aim nor the first achievement of a science. It gener-\nally comes rather late in the career of a science. The primary\naim must everywhere be to obtain control. Once this is gained,\nwe can experiment at pleasure, and measure, if we please.\nBut measurement as such is no guarantee of scientific success.\nElse its laborious measurements would long ago have put\nexperimental psychology on a par with physics. And it is\nprecisely because it has not obtamed practical control over the\nsoul that its measurements, have been so futile. Moreover, it\nis this same lack of control which has been the great obstacle\nin Psychical Research. He who discovers how to control the\nsoul, with or without machinery, wiU ipso facto fulfil the\ndesire of psychology to be a science, in fact as well as in\nambition. Until then, it should moderate its exultation over\nits '\ntruly scientific '\ncharacter as compared with more back-\nward inquiries.\nBut I agree with Dr. Troland's conclusion (p. 26) that \" the\naverage academic psychologist will look upon the above pro-\nposals as a waste of good technique upon a hopeless situa-\ntion.\" No doubt he -wiU, unless psychical researchers can get\ntheir machinery to work and their '\nphenomena '\nto appear.\nBut is it too sanguine to hope that when our present President\ntakes over the command of the Harvard Laboratory he w\\l\\\nprovide the required '\nstimulus '\nand Dr. Troland's researches\nwill be continued ?

Authorized English Translation by A. A. Brill,\nPh.B., M.D., xii. + 268. 10s. 6d. net.\nProf. Freud seldom writes on any subject without contribut-\ning much that is novel, much that is profoundly illuminating\nand suggestive, and at the same time not a little that is\nstartling and disconcerting in its apparent remoteness from the\nlines of everyday thought. This general rule is weU exemplified\nin the present small volume, which contains a collection of\nfour essays originally pubUshed in the psychoanalytical peri-\nodical \/magro. The main purpose of the book is, as the sub-\ntitle indicates, the appUcation of knowledge gained in the\ntreatment of nem'otic patients to the problems connected with\nthe mentahty and social life of primitive peoples.\nIn the first chapter on the \" Savage's Dread of Incest,\" the\nphenomena of Exogamy, Avoidances and other prohibitions\nof a sexual nature are passed in review, and an attempt is\nmade to show that these prohibitions are dii'ected against the\n(usuaUy unconscious) tendency to incest\u2014the same tendency\nthat is observed in the \" (Edipus complex \" of the neurotic\nIn certain of his previous works Freud had shown that the\nmyth of (Edipus. (who unwittingly Idlls his father and marries\nhis mother) gives expression to tendencies that represent the\nlogical outcome of a very fundamental form of reaction of\nthe developing human muid to the family envkonment\u2014\ntendencies which are, however, inconsistent with the ethical\nstandards of adult life accepted by the conscious personahty,\nand which are therefore repressed into the Unconscious. Such\nrepression does not, however, constitute annihilation, and the\nrepressed tendencies continue to exercise an influence over\nthought and behaviour ; the conflict between these tendencies\nand the repressing tendencies opposed to them giving rise to\nthe neurosis. In the present chapter evidence is brought to\nshow that this same conflict is at work in the mind of the\nsavage, who by his own sterner method of taboo endeavours\nto achieve mastery over the same primitive impulses as those\nwith which the civilised neurotic has to contend. In other\nwords, the sexual prohibitions of the savage are concerned\nwith the very same persons {e.g. mother, sister, mother-in-law,\n\fLXXX.] Review. 225\netc., in the case of a man) as those to which the repressed\ndesires of the neurotic are directed. The universahty and\nsocial character of the prohibitions in the case of savages\nindicate that the conflict is in a sense more acute among\nthem than among civilised peoples, who have achieved a more\nthorough mastery of the primitive passions concerned ; the\nneurotic, however, by the severity of his conflict showing a\ntendency to regress in this respect to the savage level.\nIn the second chapter on \" Taboo and the Ambivalence of\nEmotions,\" it is sho\"mi that taboo has certain important char-\nacteristics in common with \" compulsion neurosis ;\n\" this\ncorrespondence pointing to a fundamental similarity between\nthe psychic mechanisms involved in the two cases. In both\ncases there is a powerful compulsion combined with the absence\nof any adequate conscious motivation. In both cases, more-\nover, there is a strong tendency for the characteristic mental\nattitude to extend to other objects and situations than those\nto which it had originally reference and for this attitude to\ngive rise to serious inhibitions and cumbersome ceremonial\nperformances ; the restriction on the freedom of action thus\nbrought about being again in both cases very considerable.\nApplying to taboo the conceptions regarding mental conflict\nand rejjression arrived at by the psychoanalytic study of the\ncompulsion neuroses, Freud concludes that \" taboo is a very\nprimitive prohibition imposed from 'udthout (by an authority)\nand directed against the strongest desires of man. The desire\nto violate it continues in the unconscious,\" the taboo being,\nin fact, an externally imposed proliibition directed against the\nvery same tendencies of human nature as those against which\nare aimed the internal prohibitions of the neurotic.\nIf this conclusion is correct, we should expect to find evi-\ndence of conflict (or ambivalence of emotions, to use a term\nof Bleuler's that is now very generally adopted by j^sycho-\nanalytic writers) in the actual details of taboo. When we\nexamine these details, we find that such evidence is not\nwanting. Thus, as Freud here shows, the taboo of the dead\narises as the result of a. conflict between conscious sorrow,\ncorresponding to an attitude of afi:ection towards the departed,\nand unconscious joy resulting from repressed hatred. While the\ndead were still alive and Avith us, their desires often conflicted\n\f226 J. C. Fliigel. [part\nwith our own, and we (the living) were often tempted to wish\nin the innermost recesses of our mind that those whose presence\nthus interfered with the fulfihnent of our own wishes could be\nremoved safely out of our way. Now that Dearth has gratified\nthese secret desires, we behave as if these desires had really been\neffective, and guiltily imagine that the dead -will surely take re-\nvenge on us for the murderous thoughts that we have harboured.\nIn so doing, we avail ourselves of the psychological mechanism of\nprojection\u2014so common in certain forms of neurosis\u2014by which\nwe endeavour to free ourselves of unwelcome thoughts and tenden-\ncies by attributing them to others ; in this case our own hostile\nfeelings towards the dead are attributed to the dead themselves,\nwho are then supposed to harbour enmity against ourselves.\nHence the very widespread fear of the dead and the consequent\nnecessity of avoiding contact with them which manifests itself in\nthe taboos : as in the case of all pathological fears, a fear origin-\nally directed against our own unconscious desires has here\nbeen converted into a fear of somethmg outside ourselves\u2014\na\nfear which in its new form is quite unreasonable, and has\nno reference to reality.\nSimilar considerations are sho\\vn to apply to two other sets\nof taboos\u2014those connected with enemies and with rulers respec-\ntively, and the chapter closes with an interesting and suggestive\ndiscussion of the relation of taboo to conscience and morality.\nIn the third chapter on \" Magic, Animism and the Omnipo-\ntence of Thought,\" Freud indicates the parallelism between\nthe systems of thought involved in Magic and Animism on\nthe one side and Neurosis on the other. In both there is\ndiscoverable that \" omnipotence of thought \" (a phrase taken\nfrom one of Freud's own patients), that mistaldng of thoughts\nfor outer realities which distinguishes the unconscious levels\nof the mind. In this Freud is, of course, only carrying a\nstep further the conclusions of authorities such as Tylor and\nFrazer, who had already pointed out that Magic resulted from\na failure to distinguish between \" the order of ideas and the\norder of nature,\" \" an ideal connexion being mistaken for a\nreal one \" (the two chief Itinds of magic, hom<jeopathic and\ncontagious, corresponding to the association of ideas by simi-\nlarity and contiguity respectively). Magic, according to Freud,\ndiffers from Animism in that, while in the former omnipotence\n\fLXXX.J Review. 227\nof thought is manifested in a pure form, in the latter this\nomnipotence is \" projected \" on to imaginary spiritual beings,\nmany of the undesirable mental tendencies being thus got rid\nof in the same way as the death wishes to which we have\naheady referred. At the more advanced stage of Rehgion\nMan hands over his original omnipotence to the gods, though\nindirectly he still retains some remnants of it through his\npower of influencing the gods by prayer, sacrifices or threats.\nAt the still higher level of scientific thought, this omnijjotence\nis abandoned altogether, except in so far as science enables\nus to control Nature by understanding her laws.\nIn the fourth chapter on \" The Infantile Recurrence of\nTotemism,\" after a review of the main theories regarding\nTotemism and Exogamy and their relations to each other,\nFreud compares the attitude of jsrimitive man towards his\ntotem with the attitude sometimes adopted by neurotic children\ntowards a certain class of animals. Psychoanalysis of animal\nphobias occurring in childhood has shown that the dreaded\nanimal is often treated as a symbolic I'epresentative of the\nfather, the confhcting love and hate originally directed to the\nfather being displaced on to the animal. If we assume that\nthe totem of primitive peoples is also a father symbol (an\nassumption that is justified by the very close correspondence\nbetween the attitude of child and savage respectively towards\nthe animal concerned), many of the characteristics of totemism\nare largely explained, e.g. the fact of the totem being regarded\nas an ancestor, the identification of the present members of\nthe tribe with the totem, the general prohibition of IdlUng\nthe totem combined with the occasional solemn sacrifice of\nthe animal and the taboo on sexual relations between members\nof the same totem, i.e. the coimexion between Totemism and\nExogamy, a connexion that had puzzled so many of the\nearlier authorities. If Totemism springs from the father-\nregarding aspects of the CEdipus complex, it is only natural\nthat it should be combined with Exogamy, which (as several\nof the most eminent writers on the subject have independently\nrecognised) constitutes a reaction against incest tendencies.\nThe two closely connected institutions thus represent the\ntwo aspects of the OEdipus complex, i.e. the deske to Idll\nthe father and marry the mother. The reaction against the\n\f228 J. C. Flilgel. [part\nformer desire is of course responsible for the prohibition of\nkilling the totem animal (father representative). The occa-\nsional exceptions to this rule, as when the totem is solemnly\nsacrificed and eaten, are themselves of the greatest interest\nas revealing the ambivalent attitude towards the father, and\nFreud's analysis of the totemic feast, which is based to some\nextent ujDon the previous work of Robertson Smith, con-\nstitutes perhaps the most fascinating portion of the book,\nreveahng as it does in a most striking way the wonderful\ncomplexity of human motive and throwing at the same time a\nflood of light upon the history and meaning of a great number\nof religious observances, including the central rite of the\nChristian Church.\nWithin the small compass of this book Prof. Freud has\ncompressed a very considerable mass of material that should\nbe of the greatest interest to the psychologist and anthro-\npologist. No doubt many of his conclusions will afford matter\nfor controversy, and it must be admitted that as regards\ndetail there are many points where difficulties suggest them-\nselves, and where wider knowledge may necessitate modification\nof the views here put forward.\nIn the opinion of the present writer, however, Prof. Freud's\nm.ain conclusions as here set forth are not only in themselves\ncorrect, but (Avhen ta.ken in conjunction with the work of\nJones, Rank, Reik and other psychoanalytic students in the\nsame field) will be found to have opened a new and most\nimportant chapter of comparative psychology.\nFreud's works present a task for the translator that is by\nno means easy, but Dr. Brill has been much more successful\nin this case than in some of his earlier translations. Certain\nerrors and inconsistencies in the references (a matter of some\nimportance in a work of this character) should be corrected\nin a second edition ; the titles of English works being some-\ntimes incorrectly given, while the titles of German works are\nsometimes quoted in German and sometimes in English, even\nwhere translations do not appear to exist or where the page\nreference is to the original. There are also occasional obscuri\nties and inelegancies in the text, but on the whole the meaning\nis clearly rendered, and the book in its English guise should\nfind many readers. J. C. Flugel.\n\fLXXX.] Review. 229\nThe Road to Endor. By Lieut. E. H. Jones, I.A.R.O.\n(John Lane, The Bodley Head, London, W.)\nThe successful attempts by certain British officers to escape\nfrom the Turkish prison camjj at Yozgad have resulted in\nthe publication of two of the most exciting books relating\nto the War : Four Huridred and Fifty Miles to Freedom, and\nThe Road to Endor. As narratives of combined daring, endurance\nand ingenuity, the two books may rank equal, but the latter has\na peculiar interest for all persons interested in psychical research.\nIn February, 1917, Lieut. Jones, with three or four of his\ncompanions, began experimenting with a ouija-board. The first\nattempts, though made principally with the object of relieving\nthe tedium of prolonged imprisonment, were serious but fruit-\nless, as the board would write nothing but meaningleste com-\nbinations of letters. Then, when they were all about to give\nup in disappomtment, the \" Devil of Mischief,\" as Lieut. Jones\nputs it, prompted him to \"fake\" replies to his companions'\nquestions, purporting to come from a very communicative\nspirit named \" SaUy.\"\nLieut. Jones played the game with his fellow-prisoners\nstrictly. He never claimed that the phenomena which so\nmuch intrigued them were genuine. He invited them to\napply any test they liked and form their own conclusions.\nAs a first precaution, however, he decided not to make the\nboard work except when he had as fellow-sitter, Dr. O'Farrell.\nThis led the rest of the camp to believe that the results were\ndue to some mysterious \" rapport \" between the two.\n\" SaUy \" was joined by \" Silas P. Warner \" and several\nother communicators. They predicted the course of the war,\nor reported events of which news had not yet reached the\nsj^ectators, and as these statements frequently turned out\nto be true, their reputation steadily increased. With equal\nsuccess they referred to facts concerning the private lives\nof persons who supposed these facts known only to themselves.\nCareful records were kept for the benefit of the S.P.R., which,\nit is to be feared, has not yet received them.\nVarious tests were applied, but the Spook triumphantly\nsurmounted them all. First Lieut. Jones and Dr. O'Farrell\nwere blindfolded, then the board was placed upside down\n\f230 W. H. Salter. [part\nso that the letters on it were invisible, but in each case,\nafter a short interval, answers were forthcoming as rapid and\nas satisfactorjr as before. Finally the Spook was subjected\nto a more elaborate and apparently conclusive test. The\norder of the letters on the board was altered, and duplicate\nand triplicate boards with the altered order were prepared.\nThe mediums were blindfolded and then* hands placed on\nthe original board, which had not been shown to them after\nthe order of the letters on it had been altered. The duplicate\nand triplicate boards were placed in another room, and the\ntrijolicate, which was of small size, made to revolve within\nthe duplicate. The officers who made the triplicate revolve\nleft the room before it had stopped running. The test was\nwhether the Spook could write on the original board according\nto a code formed by the duplicate and triplicate in conjunction.\nIt did, to the satisfaction of the investigators, and its reputa-\ntion was thereby finally assured.\nMeanwliile the Turldsh Commandant of the Camp, Kiazim\nBey, had become interested, and sent the Camp Interpreter,\nan unpleasant person called Moise Eskenazi, but more generally\nknown in the Camp as the Pimple, to report. So deeply\nimpressed was the Pimple that Kiazim became anxious to\nenlist . the services of the Spook in tracing a buried Armenian\ntreasure. The Spook was only too willing to oblige, as Lieut.\nJones conceived the idea that the treasure-hunt, if conducted\nunder strict psychic instructions, might be made to lead to\nhis removal from Yozgad to some point nearer the sea, from\nwhich escape would be relatively an easy matter.\nAbout this time Lieut. Jones joined forces with Lieut. Hill,\nan Australian airman, whose determination to escape was as\ngreat as his own. At a camp entertainment they gave a\nhighly successful exhibition of stage-telepathy. Lieut. Jones,\nblindfolded, named articles handed to Lieut. Hill by members\nof the audience, read the numbers of banknotes, told the\ntime of watches, etc. Few mistakes were made, and if the\nwhole camp was not convinced it was genuine telepathy,\nnone could explain how it was done. Lieut. Hill thus became\naccepted as Lieut. Jones's fellow-medium.\nBetween them they fooled the Pimple and Kiazim Bey to\ntheir hearts' content. Under the Spook's directions they were\n\fLXXX. 1\nReview. 231\nconfined in a separate building, ^Yhere frequent seances with\nthe Pimple were held. The story of the treasure-hunt, while\nmost entertaining and exciting, is too long and complicated\nto set out here. Suffice it to say that, after the discovery\nof important and mysterious clues, the Bey became nervous\nas to his fate in the event of the matter becoming known\nto his mihtary superiors, and decided to back out of it.\nLieuts. Jones and Hill were thus reduced to their last hope of\nescape, namely to get repatriated by simulating madness. For\nthis purpose they had to reveal to some of their fellow-\nprisoners, including Dr. O'Farrell, that the whole of the pheno-\nmena of the ouija-board and the telepathy exhibition were\nfaked, and it was only with great difficulty that they succeeded\nin convincing them that this was so. Dr. O'Farrell then\ncoached them carefully as to the symptoms of the different\ntypes of madness they were respectively to simulate.\nTo the Pimple and Eaazim the Spook explained that the\napparent madness on the part of the mediums was produced\nby psychic control, in order that they might be sent to\nConstantinople, whence the treasure-hunt could be more satis-\nfactorily directed. The two Ueutenants were examined by\nlocal Turkish doctors, who expressed the opinion that they\nwere mad. The Spook then dictated a telegram wliich Kiazim\nsent to the War Office at Constantinople suggesting that the\ntwo officers should be sent there for observation, and the\nWar Office concurring, off they set under the Pimple's\nescort.\nAfter a wearisome journey the three arrived at Constantin-\nople. Here Lieuts. Jones and Hill had to submit to a far\nmore rigorous medical examination than at Yozgad. For\nseveral months they were kept under close observation by\nmental speciaUsts, both Turkish and European. Both on their\njourney to the capital and while in hospital there, the sufferings\nthey endured to maintain their deception, from prolonged\nself-starvation and other causes, would liave broken down the\nresolution of all but exceptional men. Eventually, however,\ntheir endurance was rewarded : the speciaUsts reported them\nof unsound mind, and they were sent to Smyrna for repatria-\ntion. By the time they reached Alexandria the armistice\nhad been signed.\n\f232 W. H. Salter. [part\nKiazim's actions came to the knowledge of his superiors\nand he was conrt-martialled. This may have chilled his\nardour for psychical research. The Pimple was, however,\nin June, 1919, notwithstanding rumours of fraud which had\nreached him, a convinced believer, and so far as is known,\nhe may be so stiU. The S^oook had changed his whole moral\noutlook ; it had made him a comparatively honest man,\npersuaded him to restore stolen property, and to volunteer\nfor active service, and held out hopes to him of becoming\na central figure in the religious revolution which was shortly\nto sweep over the world. It is to be feared, however, that\nwhen peace with Turkey is restored, he wiU consider the\nS.P.R. too lukewarm and unprogressive a body to apply for\nmembership.\nKiazim and Moise were of course easy dupes, but it may\nbe worth enquiring in some detail how Lieut. Jones avoided\nfor so long the detection of his fellow-prisoners. They might\nfairly have been described as a picked company. In addition\nto the technical naval and military attainments shared by\nthem all, many of them had knowledge of various branches\nof science, or had achieved success in different kinds of busi-\nness. Almost every occupation in life was represented, except,\nfortunately for Lieut. Jones, that of investigator for the S.P.R.\nAnd yet, given a man of Lieut. Jones's powers of memory\nand visualisation, and of the smartness in eliciting information\nby fishing questions, developed by his experience as a magis-\ntrate in Burma, the deception was \" as easy as falling off a\nlog.\" At every possible stage his victims delivered themselves\nup bound hand and foot.\nDealing first with the mechanical tests, that is to say, those\ndesigned to prove whether or not the mediums could produce\nintelligible replies under conditions apparently excluding fraud,\nwe note that the tests were inadequate in conception and\ncarelessly executed, and that the results were still more care-\nlessly observed. Thus when Lieut. Jones was blindfolded, he\ncould (as usually happens when the bhndfolding is done by\namateurs) see quite sufficiently for his purpose. When the\nouija-board was turned upside down, his companions failed\nto observe that he had made nicks in the edge of the board,\nso that by an exercise of visual memory, he could locate\n\fLXXX.] Review. 233\nany letter as clearly as if the board were lying right side up\nbefore his open eyes. They further, on the ground of his\nfailure to remember his part in a pantomime, attributed to\nhim a bad memory for things in general, whereas, m fact,\nas this test and numerous other incidents show, he had an\nexceptionally good one.\nThe test with the duplicate and triplicate boards, although\nfaulty in conception, should have caught Lieut. Jones out,\nif only it had been conducted with reasonable care. The\nmain defect in conception was the complexity of the test, the\nduplicate and triplicate boards being intended to furnish a\ncode unloiown both to Lieut. Jones and the investigators,\nand so to exclude any possibility of telepathy between them.\nBut this complexity in fact defeated its ends, as each factor\nwhich was designed to act, and, given caution and discretion,\nwould have acted, as an additional check, merely served,\nin the atmosphere of carelessness which prevailed, as an\nadditional loophole of escape.\nThe first mistake was in the preparation of the \" original\n\"\nboard. Instead of selecting an entirely new order of letters,\nthe investigators retained the order so well known to Lieut.\nJones, merely transposing three pairs of letters, one of the\npairs consisting of the adjacent letters DV, which thus became\nVD.\nThen one of the investigators came into a room, where\nLieut. Jones was sitting, holding the board with the new order\nof letters in his hand. This gave Lieut. Jones sufficient time\nto memorise the new order, which as regards 20 out of 26\nletters simply reproduced the old order ; he failed, however,\nto note the transposition of the V and D. Notwithstanding\nthis, the investigators were positive that the mediums, when\nthe test was made, had had no opportunity of seeing the\nnew board.\nAccordingly, when the test began and Lieut. Jones was\nblindfolded, he knew, apart from his error of observation\nas to D and V, what was the order of the letters on the\nboard placed before him. To succeed, however, he still required\ntwo items of information ; (1) which way the board was\nturned, i.e. which were the letters nearest to him and which\nfurthest, and (2) how many places to the right or left of\n9.\n\f234 W. H. Salter. [PABT\nany particular letter on the duplicate board the same letter\nwas to be found on the triplicate board. Both these gaps\nin his knowledge were speedily filled through slips on the\npart of the investigators.\nThe blindfolding was so imperfect that he could see the\nedge of the board nearest him, so that when the board was\nasked whether it could write on the new arrangement of\nletters, the reply came, \" Yes, ask something.\" It was then\nasked to write in code, the triplicate board having in the\nmeantime been made to spin, and produced a long series of\nthe letters BMX. This puzzled the investigators, who, not\nof course knowing the code, thought it might be the code\nfor \" Yes.\" One of them accordingly went to the other\nroom, and came back saying, \" Can't make it out : it's not\ncode for '\nYes.' BMX is V .\" Here he was interrupted,\nbut not before he had given Lieut. Jones sufficient information\nto reconstruct the whole code, subject to the error that V\nwas in fact on all the three test-boards one place further to\nthe left than he supposed. Code messages were thereupon\nfreely produced.\nNow the revolving triplicate had stopped in such a position\nthat each letter on it was twelve places to the left of the\ncorresponding letter on the duplicate, and this was the code\non which the messages ought to have been written. Owing,\nhowever, to the double accident, (1) of Lieut. Jones's mistake\nas to the relative positions of V and D, and (2) of V being\nthe letter the identity of which had been revealed, Lieut.\nJones was working to an imaginary code in which twenty-two\nof the twenty-six letters were one place further to the left\nthan in the real code, two were two places further to the\nleft and two were in the right position.\nWhen the investigators came to de-code the messages at first they\nfound they made nonsense, but finally they triumphantly declared\nthat the Spook had been \" coding their code \" by \" writing\none letter to the left all the way through.\" As appears\nfrom the last preceding paragraph, careful de-coding would\nhave shown that sense could only be obtained by abandoning\nthis principle as regards four letters of the alphabet. As\nLieut. Jones says, \" The proportion of cases in which the\nletter appeared one to the left of where it should be was\n\fLXXX.] Review. 235\ngreat enough to make the investigators believe that the Spook\nwas purposely writing in this way. They either did not\nnotice, or passed over as negligible, the four exceptions. Yet\nin these exceptions lay the clue to the trick.\"\nHe was equally skilfxil and equally successful in establishing\nthe evidential nature of his messages. These, as already\nmentioned, related both to public and private events. As\nregards the first class he had to rely on information given\nto him in letters from the outside world, which he disclosed\nto the Camp exclusively through the Spook, and on deductions\nand inteUigent anticipations based on the contents of his\nfellow-prisoners' letters, and to trust to events to justify\nhim, as they not infrequently did. His companions appear\nto have given the Spook credit for all his hits, and not to\nhave marked his misses. Thus, about the time America\ncame into the War, the Spook stated that a large expedi-\ntionary force was being got ready for transport to Vladivos-\ntock, full details of the number of ships, equipment, etc.,\nbeing given. Now the details as to tonnage, etc., corresponded\nto what would actually have been requked for a force of the\nsize mentioned, and as Lieut. Jones was supposed to be quite\nignorant as regards the overseas transport of troops, it seemed\ncertain that some supernormal source of knowledge had been\ntapped. Lieut. Jones happened, however, to have sufficient\nknowledge of the subject to frame a plausible answer, and\nthe fact that nothing further was heard of the expedition\ndid not damage either his or the Spook's reputation.\nAs regards the private news revealed by the board it would\nbe difficult to improve on Lieut. Jones's own account of the\n\" Louise \" incident, the main part of which is here set out\nverbatim.\nOvir War-news Spook had occupied the stage for the early\npart of the evening, and had just announced his departme.\nWe asked him to send some one else.\n\" Who are you ? \" said Alec. As he spoke the door opened\nand \" Antony \" came in, and stood close to my side.\n\" I am Lomse,\" the board spelt out.\nI felt Antony give a little start as he read the message. With-\nout a pause the Spook went on :\n\"HeUo, Tony!\"\n\" This is interesting,\" said Tony. (That was give-away n\\maber 2.)\n\f236 W. H. Salter. [part\n\" Go on, please ; tell us something.\"\nI now knew that somewhere Tony must have met a Louise.\nThat was a French name. So far as I knew he had not served\nin France ; but he had served in Egypt. One night, a month i\nor so before, in talking of Egyptian scenery, he had mentioned I\na long straight road with an avenue of trees on either side that\n\" looked spiffing by moonlight,\" and ran for miles across the il\ndesert. It struck me at the time that there was nothing parti- |\ncularly \" spiffing \" about the type of scenery described ;\nnothing, i\nat any rate, to rouse the enthusiasm he had shown, and his !\nroseate memory of it might have been tinged by pleasant com-\npanionship. Remembering this, I ventured to say more about\nLouise. Nothing could be lost by risking it.\n\" You I'emember me, Tony ? \" asked the Spook.\n\" I know two Louises,\" said Tony cautiously.\n'\nAh ! not the old one, mon vieux,\" said the Spook. [\n(Now this looks as if the Spook knew both, but a little refiec- i:\ntion shows that, given two Louises, one was quite probably older\nthan the other.) I\nAntony was delighted. !\n\" Go on,\" he said ;\n\" say something.\" i\n\" Long straight road,\" said the Spook ;\n\" trees\u2014moonlight.\" i\n\" Where was that ?\n\" asked Tony. There was a sharpness\nabout his questioning that showed he was hooked.\n\" You Imow, Tony !\n\" !\n\" France ? \"\nj\n\" No, no, stupid ! Not France ! Ah, you have not forgotten, j\nmon cher, riding in moonlight, trees and sand, and a straight\nroad\u2014and you and me and the moon.\"\n\"This is 7nost interesting,\" said Antony. Then to the board:\n\" Yes, I know ;\nEgypt\u2014Caii'o.\"\n\" Bravo, you know me. Why did you leave me ? I am in trouble.\"\nThis was cunning of the Spook. Tony must have left her, because\nhe had come to Yozgad without her. But Tony did not know this.\nHe was too interested, and his memory carried him back to another\nparting.\n\"You told me to go,\" said Tony. \"I wanted to help\"\n\u2014\nwhich showed he hadn't !\n\" But you didn't\u2014you didn't\u2014you didn't !\n\" said the Spook.\nTony ran his hands through his hair. \" This is quite right\nas far as it goes,\" he said, \" but I want to ask a few questions\nto make sure.

Hence,\nI suppose, the necessity for \" idols \" in the old days).\n\" Have you gone ba\u2014\u2022\" he checked himself and rubbed his chin.\n\" No,\" he went on. \" I won't ask that.\u2014Where are you now ?\n\"\n\fLXXX.] Review. 237\nHe had already without knowing it, answered his own question,\nbut he must be given time to forget it.\n\" Ah, Tony,\" said Louise, \" you were a dear !

Where are you\nnow ?\n\"\n\" Are you an unbeliever, Tony ? C'est moi, Louise, qui te parle !\n\" Then tell me where you are,\" Tony persisted.\n\" Oh dear, Tony. I told you I was going back. I went back !\n\"\n\" By jove !\n\" said Tony, \" that settles it. Back *o Paris !\n\"\nThe stage \" telepathy \" was, of course, done in accordance\nwith a pre-arranged code, which is set out in full in one\nof the appendices to the book, and is weU worth careful\nstudy.\nIt will be seen that Lieut. Jones possesses in a very high\ndegree all the qualities that go to the constitution of a success-\nful fraudulent medium. Fortunately both his inclinations and\nhis official duties prevent his adopting this career. On the\nprinciple, however, that the best gamekeepers are made of\nconverted poachers, it is to be hoped that he will see his\nway to collaborating with the Society in the detection of\nfraud. He would be an ideal investigator of a kind never\nmore needed than at the present time, especially if, by contact\nwith those who have for long done research work for the\nSociety, his experience were somewhat widened, and his present\ntendency to excessive dogmatism thereby slightly corrected.\nFor certainly dogmatism is the great blemish on Lieut.\nJones's book. He is, of course, too logical and cautious to\nassert in so many words that, because he \" faked \" psychical\nphenomena so as to deceive his companions, therefore no\ngenuine psychical phenomena exist. He doubtless reflected that\nhe would have exposed himself to the retort, \" In that case,\nbecause you and Lieut. Hill simulated madness so as to deceive\nthe mental experts, do you say that there is no such thing\nas real madness 1\n\" What he does suggest is that he produced\nphenomena as remarkable and varied as those produced by\nany medium, under conditions at least as rigorous as those\nto which mediums are ever subjected, and that therefore\n\f238 W. H. Salter. [part\nfraud, which was certainly the cause in his own case, cannot\nbe eliminated as a possible explanation of the others. It\nis no doubt due to the paucity of psychical literature at\nYozgad prison camp that Lieut. Jones has committed himself\nto this untenable position.\nIf postal arrangements had permitted free communication\nbetween Yozgad and Hanover Square, and the records of\nthe sittings had been forwarded, as they were made, to the\nofficers of the S.P.R., it would very soon have been pointed\nout to Lieut. Jones's companions, that they would be wise\nto attach little importance to the \"mechanical\" side of the\nSpook's performances, e.g. the writing of coherent messages\non the \" ouija \" board when reversed, or when the \" mediums \"\nwere blindfolded. Their attention might have been drawn\nto even more remarkable results produced under more stringent\nconditions by persons who admitted they faked the results,\nbut successfully concealed their modus operandi, to the slate-\nwriting, for instance, of Mr. S. J. Davey, as recorded in Vol.\nIII. of the Society's Journal (1887-1888).\nMr. Davey's performances and the discussion which followed\nthem are of especial interest as showing that from the earliest\ndays of the S.P.R. it was generally recognised that the only\nevidence of the supernormal origin of communications, to\nwhich any importance could safely be attached, was that\nbased on the contents of the communications, and not on the\napparent impossibility of producing them except by super-\nnormal agency. It would appear from his book that Lieut.\nJones would claim that, even judged by this standard, he\nproduced results as remarkable as any obtained through pro-\nfessedly genuine mediums.\nBut in point of fact Lieut. Jones was working under con-\nditions far more favourable to fraud than the average medium\nenjoys. He was one of a small group of men shut up together\nfor months and even years : to relieve the tedium of captivity\nthey freely told each other all sorts of details of their past\nlives, both before and during the War, and then forgot they\nhad ever told them : they shared with each other news from\nthe outside world : and finally, as the book clearly shows,\nthey none of them had the sUghtest idea of the precautions\nnecessary to exclude fraud.\n\fLXXX.] Review. 239\nVery different is the lot of a professional medium. Any\nmember of the public may obtain a sitting with him. Many\nof his sitters wUl no doubt be as guileless as Lieut. Jones's\nvictims, allowing themselves to be \"pumped,\" or of their\nown accord giving away vital information without knowing\nthat they have done so. But not all will be of this class :\nfrom time to time the medium will be confronted with sitters\nhe has never seen before, to whose identity and previous\nhistory he has not the slightest clue, who say little (if any-\nthing), and keep a careful note of what they say to him\nand he says to them. If they have more than one sitting,\nthey carefully check anything said by the medium at the\nlater sittings, to see whether he is worldng on any statement\nmade or hint given at a previous sitting. Nor is the possi-\nbility of the medium making enquiries between the sittings\noverlooked. Private detectives have even been employed to\ndiscover whether anything of tliis kind has been done (see\nVol. XXX., p. 342, of the S.P.R. Proceedings).\nIt may be admitted that, even when every conceivable\nprecaution has been taken, it is impossible to guarantee with\nabsolute certainty that the medium has not obtained by normal\nmethods unknown to the investigators, information purporting\nto be derived from supernormal sources. The records of the\nS.P.R. are, however, full of cases where mediums have dis-\nplayed knowledge which, if not supernormal in origin, could\nonly have been obtained by them by collusion with third\nparties, carefully elaborated and concealed with miraculous\nskill. On this hypothesis, to account for some of the \" book-\ntests\n\" given through Mrs. Leonard, one must assume that\nMrs. Leonard, with the connivance of her sitter's servants,\nsecretly introduced into her sitter's private apartments within\na particular period of a few days, an accomplice with a good\nworldng knowledge of classical Greek. Most people, when\nfaced with the alternative of assuming this or of accepting\nsome supernormal means of communication, find that the\nlatter course makes less demands on their credulity.\nLieut. Jones must, however, be aware that those who think\nthere is something more in professed supernormal communica-\ntions than can be explained by chance or fraud, do not rest\ntheir case entirely on results obtained from professional mediums,\n\f240 W. H. Salter. [part lxxx.]\neven from mediums who, as Mrs. Piper, have been kept under\nclose observation by trained investigators over a long period.\nMuch of the most interesting material which has engaged the\nSociety's attention has come from amateur automatists, whose\nbona fides is entirely above suspicion.\nParticularly is this the case with regard to telepathy, whether\nspontaneous or experimental.- In the nature of things tele-\npathic experiments are not worthy of serious consideration\nunless the bona fides of both agent and percipient is un-\ndoubted, and there is no clearer proof of the inadequacy of\nLieut. Jones's companions as investigators than their willingness\nto attach importance to stage performances like those of\nLieut. Jones and Lieut. Hill. It may be hoped that by this\ntime they (and Lieut. Jones also) may have found an oppor-\ntunity to study, e.g. Prof. Gilbert Murray's experiments (see\nVol. XXIX. of Proceedings), and thereby to learn on what\ngrounds the case for a serious examination of the subject\nreally rests.\nNotwithstanding these unfortunate blemishes the book is\none which deserves the careful study of all interested in\nPsychical Research. Much may be learnt from it as to the\nease with which investigators even of a high standard of general\nability can be deceived by a medium with sufficient brains\nto take advantage of apparently unimportant slips and neglig-\nences, and as to the untrustworthiness of any tests which are\nnot carried out with the most rigorous and exacting attention\nto detail.\nW.

[part\n\u00a7 1-\nIntroductory.\nThe so-called book-tests we have to examine are attempts\nby Mrs. Leonard's control Feda to indicate the contents\nof a particular page of a particular book vt^hich Mrs.\nLeonard has not seen with her bodily eyes, and which\nis not, at the time of the sitting, known to the sitter.\nFor example, Feda might tell the sitter that the com-\nmunicator wants him to go to the book-case between\nthe fireplace and the window in bis study, and in the\nthird shelf from the bottom to take the seventh book\nfrom the left and open it at the 48th page, where about\none-third of the w&j down he will find a passage which\nmay be regarded as an appropriate message from the\ncommunicator to him. In the most typical cases the\ninterior of the sitter's residence, and sometimes even\nthe sitter's name, is u.nknown to Mrs. Leonard. The\nsitter himself is milikely consciously to remember what\nbook occupies the exact place indicated, and even if he\nhas read the book, which he often has not, it is prac-\ntically certain that he does not know what is on the-\nspecified page.\nA good book-test therefore M^ould exclude ordinary\ntelepathy from the sitter as an explanation, and would\nmake it extremely difficult to suppose that Feda derives\nher information from any living human being. It would\nseem that either she is capable of exercising pure clair-\nvoyance\u2014that is, obtaining knowledge of physical appear-\nances which are out of the range of any one's senses ;\n^\n1 The term clairvoyance is sometimes used to express externalised\nor semi-externalised vision of \" spirits \" such as Mrs. Leonard in trance\n(or Feda) appears to have. I have, however, been accustomed to\nuse it in the above defined sense, though without any implication of\nanalogy to the sense of sight. It is called by Myers in Human\nPersonality Telaesthesia.\n\fLXXXI.] A71 Examination of Book-Tests. 243\nor else that she is in communication with some spirit,\nin or out of the body, who has this power. It is as\nexcluding telepathy from the sitter that Feda professes\ninterest in the book-tests. She will say to a sitter who\nhas not had one before :\n\" He [the communicator] wants\nto give you one of the book-tests . . . tests tha.t prevent\npeople thinking it is telepathy,\" or \" this test is to do\naway with any idea [you] may have of telepathy.\" It\nis noticeable that the book-tests in this collection are\nalways given through Feda as an intermediary. Even\ncommunicators who themselves on occasion control directly,\nsuch as A. V. B., are represented as dictating their\nbook-tests to Feda. Feda, however, is not generally\nrepresented as herself perceiving the inside of the closed\nbook. That is the function of the communicator.\nThe origin of book-tests is not exactly known to us,\nand probably cannot be ascertained; for Mrs. Leonard's\nwaking knowledge of what passes while she is in trance\nis at most very imperfect, and we are of course not in\ntouch with all who have sat with her. Nor do we know\nwhen they first began. We have, however, a large collection\nof book-tests given in 1917, 1918, and January 1919 ;\nand I think it is probable that if they occurred before\n1917 they v\/ere at any rate infrequent, or we should\nhave heard of them more. Our collection is ?o mis-\ncellaneous one. It contains first a great many\u2014about 63\n\u2014\nreceived by Miss Radclyffe Hall and (Una,) Lady Troubridge\n(either together or one of them alone) as sitters,^ and\nvery carefully recorded and annotated by them. These\nI shall call the A. V. B. book-tests, the communicator\nbeing the same A. V. B. who took a leading part in\nthe Leonard sittings reported by Miss Radclyffe Hall\nand Lady Troubridge in their paper recently published in\nthe Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XXX.\nThen we have twelve received by Mrs. Salter, purport-\ning to come from her father, Dr. A. W. Verrall, whose\nname is familiar to readers of the Proceedings as a com-\nmunicator in the \" Statins \" and \" Ear of Dionysius\n\"\n^ When Miss Radclyffe Hall and Lady Troubridge sat together with\nMrs. Leonard, as they usually did, one or other acted as note-taker.\n\f244 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part |\nj\ncases. These I shall call the A. W. V. book-tests. And |\nfurther we have book-tests received by about 37 other 1\nsitters, one or more by each\u2014the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas\nhas sent 19\u2014and examined so far as possible by Lady\nTroubridge or Mrs. Salter.\nIt is noticeable that throughout this collection of\nbook-tests each sitter has his or her special communi-\ncator. Thus in book-tests received by Miss Radclyffe\nHall or Lady Troubridge (whom for short I will call\nM. R. H. and U. V. T., as they call themselves in their\nown paper above mentioned) the communicator is alwaj^s\nA. V. B., though occasionally A. W. V. or some one\nelse is also said to be present and taking part. Similarly\nin those received by ]\\Irs. Salter, A. W. V. is always\nthe communicator, though sometimes accompanied by ;\nMrs. Verrall or by A. V. B. Mrs. Beadon's communicator !\nis always her husband, and so on.\nIt will have been perceived from the general descrip-\ntion I have given of a typical book-test, that the plan j\nof referring the sitter to a particular page for \" a message \" '\ngives great opportunity for vagueness. And in fact in\nsome cases no indication whatever is given of the nature\nof the message, and in some cases the description is of\nthe slightest. It seldom happens that the sitter can say\nbeforehand from Feda's description exactly what he\nexpects to find. It is often almost presented to him\nas a kind of puzzle, as if the communicator said :\n\" See\nif you can guess what I mean when I say there is a\nmessage for you on such and such a page.\" It would\nbe an error, however, to suppose that on almost any\npage of any book something that may pass as a message\nmay be found ; and there is of course still less proba-\nbility that when indications, even vague ones, of the\nnature of the message are given, the message when found\nwill conform to them.^ The difficulty is in deciding\nwhat we may legitimately expect in the way of accidental\ncoincidences ; and this difficulty will be with us in a\ngood many of the cases to be considered. It is obviously\n^ In Appendix A will be found some experiments in random correspon-\ndences.\n\fLxxxi.] A71 Examination of Book-Tests. 245\ni\na matter on which people are hkely to forra different\njudgments to some extent, and in which bias might come\nin. For this reason I, as a person outside the experiments,\nhave been asked to report on the evidence collected. I\nhave had nothing to do with collecting it, and have\nno successful book-test to contribute, so that it is perhaps\neasier for me to approach all the cases from an equally\noutside point of view, than it might be, e.g. for\nLady Troubridge or Mrs. Salter, who might possibly be\nthought in danger of judging their own cases differently\nfrom the book-tests received by others. These ladies\ntherefore asked me to undertake the Report.\nBefore proceeding with it I had better say that I have\ntaken no personal part in verifying the tests, having simply\naccepted the records as furnished to me, both of what was\nsaid at the sittings and of the subsequent verification.\nThis verification has, so far as I can judge, been very\ncarefully carried out in every instance I have made use of.\nHere and there I have asked a question to make\ncertain points clear, but that is all. In quoting the\nrecords of Feda's remarks I have, in order to make\neasier reading, ventured to modify the childish mode of\nspeaking\u2014omitting the lisping I's for r's and some of\nthe mispronunciations. I have also occasionally put full\nstops for commas in quoting from records, but never\nwhere the sense would be thereby altered.\nIt should be understood from the beginning that many\nbook-tests and items of book-tests are complete failures,\nand that apparent precision a.nd fulness of detail in what\nthe communicator says, and confidence expressed by him\nthat the test should be a good one, are no guarantee of\nsuccess. I have endeavoured to tabulate roughly the number\nof successes and failures in the cases before us. Roughly\nspeaking, out of about 532 items, rather over a third were\ncompletely or approximately successfiil.^ But I do not\n^ The following are further details. There were 34 sitters whose\nbook-tests were verified (2 others failed to send us their notes, and\n3 others were unable to identify the book-case in which the book was said\nto be). These sitters had among them 146 sittings at which book-tests\nwere given, and at these sittings about 532 separate book-test items.\n\f246 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc. [part\ntliink this really tells us very much ;\nfirst, because\nthe classification is difficult and uncertain, and secondly,\nbecause the evidential importance of successes, as unlikely\nto occur by chance, varies enormously.\nAssuming the success of smy book-test under examina-\ntion to be beyond what ca.n be attributed to chance,\nwe have to ask three questions about the supernormal\nknowledge displayed\u2014meaning by supernormal knowledge\nthat not normally possessed by Mrs. Leonard. First was it,\nor may it have been, possessed by the sitter, and therefore\npossibly obtained telepathically from him 1 Correct des-\ncription of the bookcase and its surroundings and of the\noutside of the test-book, or books near it, is usually\nof this kind, for a bookcase in the sitter's home must\nas a rule be assumed known to him, and the appearance\nand titles of the books in it are likely to have passed\nunder his eye. Some experiments were, however, tried\nin which special precautions were taken to exclude know-\nledge by the sitters of what books stood in particular places.\nA second question is, was the knowledge possessed\nby any other human being who can be supposed in\ntouch with the mediiim or the sitter ? There are three\ncases in our collection where the books are located in\na house unknown to the sitter, but well known to a\nprevious sitter. These, however, were not ver}^ successful\nas book-tests.^\nA third question is, was the knowledge possessed\nby the communicator before his death, so that his memory\nmay be the source drawn on ? In the absence of the\nfirst and second possibilities the third would of course, if\nclairvoyance be excluded, give us evidence of survival.\nIf all these three questions are answered in the negative,\nbut only then, do we seem driven to assume pure clair-\noccurred, not including statements about titles or other outside things.\nThe number of items at a sitting varied from 1 to 15. These 532 items\nmay be classed as 92 successful ; 100 approximately successful ; 204\ncomplete failures ; 40 nearly complete failures ; 96 dubious. Taking\nthe first two classes together we may say that about 36 per cent, of\nthe attempts were approximately successful.\n'\u2022\nThey are referred to on other grounds on pp. 372-374.\n\fLXXXI.] A71 Examination of Book-Tests. 247\nvoyance\u2014a knowledge of plwsical appearances not obtained\nthrough anybody's senses.^ Evidence for this it will be\nremembered is at present very scanty,^ whether we sup-\npose the perceiving mind to be incarnate or discarnate,\nso that it would be extremely interesting if it could\nbe established through book-tests. According to Feda, it\nis generally clairvoyance exercised by the communicator\nthat is the source of the knowledge shown. It will be\nobserved that the three above-named sources of super-\nnormal knowledge\u2014the sitter, other living persons, and\nthe memory of the communicator\u2014may work together,\nor any two of them ma)^ and when they do so mauj\nperhaps fortify each other. It would be interesting to\ndiscover, if we could, whether knowledge possessed by both\nsitter and supposed communicator is more likely to reach\nthe control Feda, than that possessed by the sitter alone.\nIn order that the reader may know something of what\nhe is embarking upon I will conckide this introductory\nsection with a typical book-test which, I think it will\nbe admitted, is decidedly good, though not as complete\nas we could wish. It is accompanied by a remarkable\ndisplay of knowledge of external things near the book,\nwhich must apparently have had a supernormal origin.\n^ I have in this hst of possible sources of information ignored one\nsuggested by Feda because I cannot profess to understand it. It is\nthat previous readers of the book have left recognisable psychic traces\non it. As she puts it on one occasion (see below, p. 357), \" When\nreading the book they have in a way psychometrised the book and left\na thought.\"' This would seem, however, to involve something analogous\nto clairvoyance whatever interpretation we put upon it.\n^ The most important work that has been done on the subject with\nany success was a series of experiments carried out by Prof. Charles\nRichet, of which the account was published in the Proceedings of the\nS.P.R., Vol. v., in an article entitled, \"Relation de Divers Experiences\nsur la transmission mentale, la Lueidite, et autres Phenomenes non\nexplicables par les Donnees Scientifiques actuelles.\" For clairvoyance,\nor as Professor Richet calls it, Lueidite, see pp. 77-116 of that article.\nThe experiments were done with different hypnotised subjects, who tried\nto describe or reproduce drawings in closed envelopes held near them,\nno one knowing the contents of the particular envelope. \\Vliat may\nbe regarded as success was obtained in somewhat over 10 per cent, of\nthe experiments, which is about three times what chance produced in a\nseries of parallel experiments.\n\f248 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nThe book-test in question was an A. V. B. one on\nSeptember 12, 1917. M. R. H. and U. V. T. were\nboth present, one of them, as was their wont, recording.\nFeda, who has her nicknames for most sitters and com-\nmunicators, caJls A. V. B. Ladye\u2014a nickname used by\nA. V.

H.'s] own\nbooks, it's the books that go from the window.\n[This particular set of bookshelves had been identified in\nconnexion with previous book-tests, so its mention here\nis not evidential ; but in view of what follows it must\nbe remembered that at this time M. R. H. and U. V. T.\nwere anonymous to IN'Irs. Leonard. It js believed that\nshe did not loiow their names, and it is almost im-\npossible to suppose that she had ever been at M. R.

I will stand up-\nand you shall touch me just about where you think that\nthat shelf would come on my body. (Feda touches sitter's\nsldrt just barely below the top of a side pocket in the skirt.).\nF. She says it's the nineteenth book and the fifty-twoth page,\nand it's near the top of the page, but it's not the first,\nsentence.\nS. What's it about ?\nF. Feda can't make this out. Oh what does she mean ? This\nis funny ! (Feda begins pulling at [an ornament worn\nby the sitter].) She says, in a way, it has a bearing on this.\nS. Do you mean this [ornament] that you are touching ?\n1 In dialogues quoted in this paper F. .stands for Feda and S. for\nthe sitter. Feda has a way of interspersing her conversation with\nasides, generally addressed to the communicator but sometimes appa-\nrently to herself. These asides are enclosed in round brackets and.\npreceded by the letters s.v. standing for sotto voce.\n\f\f\fLxxxi.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 249\nF. Yes. Well, she says, if you go back in your mind to that,\nwhat you will find on page fifty-two, will take you back\n^ to something connected with that. (Here Feda touches\nthe [ornament] again.) She's laughing, she says that\neven though if read in one way it is connected with that\n[ornament], yet in another way it will fall into line\nwith the other messages. It can be read in two ways.\nShe says, a person reading it who did not loiow the\nconnection of the [ornament] would read it only as\nbeing appropriate to the other messages.\n[This means as referring in some way to psychical research\nwhich previous book-test messages to M. R. H. and\nIT. V. T. had been interpreted as doing.]\nF, [continuing] Now Avhat is she doing '?\nFeda don't know\nwhat this bit means, but she's showing Feda a picture.\nShe just flashed it up before Feda.\n[Feda jjroceeds to describe a picture, quickly identified by\nthe sitters as a small painting called \" Le Canape Bleu,\"\nwhich was hanging close to the book-case in question,\na photogravure of it is given opposite. The description,\nthough not quite correct, is I think, and I believe every\none would agree, unmistakable. The description is as\nfollows :]\nF. It's somebody sitting down without many clothes on.\n[This was said in rather a shocked tone suggesting\ndisapproval of the absence of clothes.] They're bending\ndown like this. (Feda assumes a pose, she bends far\nforward from the waist, extends her right arm, and\ndrops her face on to the extended arm.)\nS. What more can you see ? .\nF. WeU, one leg seems to be a bit over the other, like this.\n(Feda assumes a position with her legs as well as she\ncan do under a skirt ; she elevates the right thigh till\nit almost touches her body, dropping at the same time\nthe left leg till the knee nearly touches the ground.)\nYou can only see one leg plainly, the other one seems\nto be underneath it. [This is, of course, not an accurate\nbit of description.] Feda thinks it is something that\nyou've got.\nS. Which of us ?\n\f250 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nF. Feda thought it was Mrs. Una [U. V. T.] but Feda isn't\nsure because Ladye can often give things through you\n[one for the other] so Feda won't say which. Fe|ia\nwon't jump her on to that just yet.\nS. Ca,n you see what the figure is lying or sitting on ?\nF. It's not lying, it's sitting, because Ladye can make Feda\ndo it on this chair. There's something that looks to\nFeda rather round.\nS. She gives this picture after mentioning the books ?\nF. Yes, while giving the test about the books, suddenly that\npicture came quick up. Feda sees that she hasn't got\nmuch clothes on, the woman hasn't. Ladye says you\nmust put it in more artistic language than Feda's. Do\nyou know, she's showing it to Feda in a funny kind of\nway like black and Avhity looking, the figure seems to\nshow up light against dark ; but Feda can't see any\ncolour. [The actual colouring of the picture is very\nsombre and neutral, the white figure standing out against\na dark background ; the jet black hair of the woman\nenhancing the black and white effect which seems to\nhave been caught by Feda.] She says something about\nsomething with four lines going down. Feda thinks it's\nsomething to do with v\/hat the figure is sitting on. She's\nlaughing.\nS. There's no mistaldng now where the books are.\nF. She says, no, she thinks now that she loiows them by\nheart. It's a funny position in that picture. It's silly\nFeda thinks, because you can't see the face. Oh ! Feda\nsees that the fingers aren't quite straight, Feda sees that\nthree of them are curved in rather, but the forefinger\nsticks out straighter, it's like this ;\n(Feda takes a pose\nwith her right hand, showing the second, third, and\nfourth fingers curved in, but the forefinger sticldng out\nalmost straight) Ladye 's showing Feda that the wrist\nand hand make rather a smooth outline, not showing the\nbones or knuckles much, like you see sometimes.\nThis ends all the portion of the sitting connected with the\nbook-test. The picture so minutely and so nearly accurately\ndescribed belongs, of course, to the external class of\n\fI.XXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 251\nthings\u2014those known to the sitters and possibly tele-\npatheticaily learnt from them. But it should be noted\nthat the description is not entirely in accordance with\ntheir conscious recollection of the picture. They thought\n&t the time that the description of the position and\nappearance of the right hand, which was really accurate,\nwas wrong. We cannot, however, assume that they had\nnot retained a correct impression subliminally.\nAnother important point to note is that the picture\nhad been well known to the communicator in her life-\ntime, so that her memory may have been the source\nof information. She may have \" flashed it up before\nFeda \" from her own mind. It had been bought after\nbeing seen at an exhibition by A. V. B. and M. R. H.\ntogether, and it had afterwards hung in their house.\nThe room in which the picture hung at the time of the\nsitting was not known to A. V. B. in her lifetime,^ nor\ntherefore the proximity of the picture to the bookcase.\nArticles of furniture and other objects which had belonged\nto or were familiar to A. V. B. were in the room, and\nsome of these were on later occasions well described by\nFeda (see Appendix B).\nI now turn to the verification of the part constituting\nthe book-test proper. The shelf whose height had been\nindicated proved to be one from which the books of two\nprevious book-tests had been selected. These two volumes\nhad been temporarily removed for purposes of verification\nand annotation,^ and this introduced a difficulty. For\nowing to the fact that the trance personalities affirmed that\nbook-tests were, generally speaking, prepared at an in-\ndefinite time beforehand\u2014not selected and read at the\ntime of communication\u2014Feda had been previously assured\nthat the books at the flat would not be moved. It was\nhoped by this means to avoid doubt as to what the\norder of the books had been at the time of selection.\n1 Strictly speaking, A. V. B. Imew M. R. H.'s fiat in an unfurnished\ncondition, but she died before it was furnished and occupied.\n2 Miss Radclyffe Hall and Lady Troubridge made a practice of includ-\ning in their records a full copy of the whole of any page on which\na message was stated to be.\n\f252 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nUnfortunately it produced in this instance another ambi-\nguity. Were the conspicuous and carefully marked empty\nspaces belonging to the temporarily absent books to be\ncounted as books in arriving at the nineteenth, or were\nthey not 1 Without looking inside the books, it was\ndecided that the nineteenth volume from the window,\nin the sheH as it should be, not in the shelf as it was\nat the moment, must be taken as the one meant. This\nproved to be Orval, or the Fool of Time, by Owen Meredith.\nIt had belonged to the communicator, and had indeed\nbeen presented to her by the avithor in 1878. It had\nnot, to the best of their belief, ever been read or even\nopened by M. R. H. or U. V. T. The poem is in\ndramatic form, and the line indicated\u2014namely, one near\nthe top of page 52, but not the first sentence\u2014in fact\nthe line following the first full stop is :\nTo-day\u2014to-morrow\u2014yesterday\u2014for ever !\nThis line must, I think, be regarded as conforming in\nsome degree to both of the two things affirmed by Feda\nabout the passage near the top of page 52. Feda said it\nwould be found appropriate to the ornament which she\ntouched, and also in some way to psychical research. Now\nthe ornament had a history causing it to be regarded in a\nmarked degree with a sentiment v\/hich might be summarised\nin the words of the line ; and as to psychical research, it\nwas the hope of proving the continuation of individual\nlife beyond the grave, or, as we sometimes express it,\nlife \"for ever,\" that led M. R. H. and U. V. T. to\ndevote much time and energy to psychical research.\nI think then that it must be admitted that without\nany straining we find up to a certain point the double\nappropriateness required. Is it sufficient to exclude\naccidental coincidence ? Our decision must depend, partly\nat least, on an accumulation of similar evidence in other\ncases. But we may be allowed to express a natural\nwish that the description here and elsewhere had been\na little more definite\u2014that we had, for instance, a\ncorrespondence as unmistakable and complete as that\nof the picture with Feda's description of it. It would\n\fLXXXI.] A71 Examination of Book-Tests. 253\nhave been more satisfactory if the hne could have been\nquoted, or if \\fe had been told that the words \" yesterday\n\"\nand \" for ever \" occurred in it, or that the line implies\ncontinuation through life and after death.\nAs regards the question of the communicator's memory\nhere as a source of knowledge, we may no doubt assume\nthat she had read the poem, and read it in this particular\nvolume. But it is, I think, very improbable that, if\nshe remembered the line, she associated it, in this life at\nany rate, with the number on the page on which it occurs.\nThat is an association that we do not make in reading,\nunless there is some special reason for it.\n\u00a7 2.\nA Case where the Memory of the Communicator seems\nTHE MOST LIKELY SoURCE OF INFORMATION.\nI will next quote a case in which the memory of the\ncommunicator seems almost certainly to be the source\nof information\u2014so much so that if accurately described\nit serves as evidence of the communicator's identity in\nthe same kind of way as would the reading of a sealed\nletter after the writer's death. The test was received\nby Mrs. Hugh Talbot, and is one of the earhest book-\ntests of which we have a record.^ It was given on\nMarch 19, 1917, but most unfortunately was not recorded\nin writing till the end of December of the same year.\nThis, of course, greatly diminishes the value of the record,\nthough happily we have the testimony of two witnesses,\nbesides the sitter, who were aware of what Feda had\nsaid before verification.\nMrs. Talbot's report, written out and sent to Lady\nTroubridge on December 29, 1917, is as follows :\nTwo sittings \\\\ith ]Mrs. Leonard were arranged for me\nthrough Mrs. Beadon last March, one for Saturday 17th at\n5 p.m. and the other at the same hour on Monday the\n1 We have pne earlier\u2014namely one received by Mr. Kenneth Richmond\non Feb. 13, 1917. It conforms to the ordinary tj-pe, and is distinctly\ninteresting though somewhat confused. I do not quote it in this paper.\n\f254 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\n19th. Mrs. Leonard at this time knew neither my name\nnor address, nor had I ever been to her or any other\nmedium, before, in my life.\nOn Monday the first part of the time was taken up by\nwhat one might call a medley of descriptions, all more or\nless recognisable, of different people, together with a\nnumber of messages, some of which were intelligible and\nsome not. Then Feda (as I am told the control is called)\nga\\'e a very correct description of my husband's personal\najipearance, and from then on he alone seemed to speak\n(through her of course) and a most extraordinary con-\nversation folloAved. Evidently he was trying by every\nmeans in his power to j)rove to me his identity and to\nshow me it really was himself, and as time went on I was\nforced to believe this was indeed so.\nAll he said, or rather Feda for him, was clear and lucid.\nIncidents of the past, known only to him and. to me were\nspoken of, belongings trivial in themselves but possessing\nfor him a particular personal interest of which T was\naware, were minutely and correctly described, and I was\nasked if I still had them. Also I was asked repeatedly if\nI believed it was himself speaking, and assured that death,\nwas really not death at all, that life continued not so\nvery unlike this life and that he did not feel changed at\nall. Feda kept on saying : '\"Do you believe, he does\nwant you to Imow it is really himself.\" I said I could\nnot be sure but I thought it must be true. All this was\nvery interesting to me, and very strange, more strange\nbecause it all seemed so natural. Suddenly Feda began a\ntiresome description of a book, she said it was leather and\ndark, and tried to show me the size. Mrs. Leonard showed\na length of eight to ten inches long with her hands, and\nfour or five Avide. She (Feda) said \"It is not exactly a\nbook, it is not printed, Feda wouldn't call it a book, it\nhas writing in.\" It was long before I could connect this\ndescription with anything at all, but at last I remembered\na red leather note book of my husband's, which I think\nhe called a log book, and I asked :\n\" Is it a log book ?\n\"\nFeda seemed puzzled at this and not to know' what a log\nbook was, and repeated the word once or twice then said\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Booh-Tests. 255\n''\nYes, yes, he says it might be a log book.\" I then said\n\" Is it a red book ?\n\" On this point there was hesitation,\nthey thought possibly it was, though he thought it was\ndarker. The answer was undecided, and Feda began a\nwearisome description all over again, adding that I was to\nlook on page twelve, for something witten (I am not sure\nof this word) there, that it would be so interesting after\nthis conversation. Then she said \" He is not sure it is\npage twelve, it might be thirteen, it is so long, but he\ndoes want you to look and to try and find it. It would\ninterest him to Imow if this extract is there.\"' I was\nrather half hearted in responding to all this, there Avas so\nmuch of it, and it sounded purposeless and also I\nremembered the book so well, having often looked through\nit wondering if it was any good keej)ing it, although\nbesides things to do with ships and my husband's work\nthere were, I remembered, a few notes and verses in it.\nBut the chief reason I was anxious to get off the subject\nwas that I felt sure the book would not be forthcoming ;\neither I had thro^vn it awaj^, or it had gone with a lot\nof other things to a luggage room in the opposite block\nof flats where it would hardly be possible to get at it.\nHowever, I did not quite like to say this, and not attach-\ning any importance to it, replied rather indefinitely that\nI would see if I could find it. But this did not satisfy\nFeda. She started all over again becoming more and more\ninsistent and went on to say \" He is not sure of the\ncolour, he does not know. There are two books, you will\nknow the one he means by a diagram of languages in the\nfront.\" And here foUoAved a string of words, in what\norder I forget \" Indo-European, Aryan, Semitic languages,\"\nand others, repeating it several times, and she said \" There\nare lines, but not straight, going like this \"\u2014drawing with\nher finger lines going out sideways from one centre. Then\nagain the words, \" A table of Arabian languages, Semitic\nlanguages.\" I have tried to put it as she said it, but of\ncourse I cannot be sure she put the names in that\norder. What I am quite sure of is the actual words\nshe used at one time or another. She said all the names\nand sometimes \" table,\" sometimes \" diagram \" and some-\n\f6 Mrs. Henry Sidgivich. [paet\ntimes \"drawing,-' and all insistenthj. It sounded absolute\nrubbish to me. I had never heard of a diagram of\nlanguages and all these Eastern names jumbled together\nsounded like nothing at all, and she kept on repeating\nthem and saying this is how I was to know the book, and\nkept on and on '\u2022\nWill you look at page twelve or thirteen.\nIf it is there, it would interest him so much after this\nconversation. He does want you to, he wants you to\npromise.\" By this time I had come to the conclusion\nthat what I had heard of happening at these sittings had\ncome to pass, viz. that the medium was tired and talkmg\nnonsense, so I hastened to pacify her by promising to look\nfor the book, and was glad when the sitting almost at\nonce came to an end.\nI went home thinking very little of all this last part ;\nstill, after telUng my sister and niece all that I con-\nsidered the interesting things said in the beginning, I did\nmention that in the end the medium began talking a lot\nof rubbish about a book, and asldng me to look on page\ntwelve or thirteen to find something interesting. I was to\nknow the book by a diagram of languages. After dinner,\nthe same evening, my niece, who had taken more notice\nof all this than either my sister or myself, begged me to\nlook for the book at once. I wanted to wait till the next\nday, saying I knew it was all nonsense. However, in the\nend I went to the book-shelf, and after some time, right\nat the back of the top shelf I found one or tAvo old\nnotebooks belonging to my husband, which I had never\nfelt I cared to open. One, a shabby black leather, corre-\nsponded in size to the description given, and I absent-\nmindedly opened it, wondering in my mind whether the\none I was looking for had been destroyed or only sent\naway. To my utter astonishment, my eyes fell on the\nwords, Table of Semitic or Syro-Arabian Languages,\" and\npulling out the leaf, which was a long folded jjiece of\npaper pasted in, I saw on the other side \" General table\nof the Aryan and Indo-European languages.\" It was the\ndiagram of which Feda had spoken.

[part\nMrs. Talbot wrote, at Lady Troubridge's request, to\nher iiiece and her sister, askmg them to write down what\nthey remembered. Their account follows :\nMiss Bowyer Smyth's Account.\nOn March 19, 1917, niy aunt, Mrs. Hugh Talbot, had a\nsitting with Mrs. Leonard. When she came home, her\nsister, Mrs. Fitzmaurice, and I, asked her about it. Among\nother things she said she had been told to look for \" a\nbook, but not exactl}^ a book, a sort of note book.\" She\nwould know the book by a '\"\ndrawing about languages \" in\nthe beginning of it and on page 12 or 13 she would find\nsomething interesting.\nMy Aunt did not seem at all impressed or interested, in\nfact she thought the whole thing sounded such nonsense\nthat she was sure it was no use looking for the book ;\nthe size of which had also been indicated by the medium\nwith her hands, namely about eight or ten inches long.\nIt was not till after dinner that night that Mi's. Fitz-\nmaurice and I persuaded her to look for the book, she\nwas so firmly convinced it would be no use. She finally\ngot out some old and dusty note books of her late\nhusband's, and in one found, first a table of languages,\nand on page twelve or thirteen the sensations of a man\npassing through death. I remember the whole incident\nquite clearly, as it seemed to me so unusual and interest-\ning, especially as my Aunt had evidently never opened or\nread these n^ote books before, in fact it took her a con-\nsiderable time to find them and she at first thought she\nhad not kept them.\n(Signed) Doris Bowyer Smyth.\nCharmouth, 18.12.17.\nMrs. Fitzmaurice s Account.\nOn Monday, March 19, 1917, my sister. Mis. Talbot, had\nher second sitting with Mrs. Leonard. She had already\nhad one very interesting one, so that my niece. Miss\nBowyer Smyth, and myself were very anxious to hear about\nit. My sister repeated as far as she could everything the\n\fLxxxi.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 259\nmedium had said and mentioned particularly that she had\nbeen asked to look for a certain book. She asked the\nmedium what kind of book, and she was told it was a\nbook with a diagram or table of languages in the front.\nMy sister said, is it what they call a \" log \" book, and the\nmedium immediately said \" Yes, yes a log book,\" and that\nshe was to find page twelve or thirteen. My sister in\ntelling us spoke as if this were nonsense and I personally\ndid not pay much attention about the book. I was so\nmuch more interested in certain remarks jDurjoorting to\ncome from my brother-in-law, for to me who knew him so\nwell they seemed so exactly Uke what I could imagine\nhis saying ;\nthey seemed to bear his personality.\nLater on, at the end of dinner, my sister went to a\nbook case in the dining room to look for the book (I do\nnot remember asking her to do so, though my niece says\nwe both asked her to), but she suddenly gave an exclama-\ntion of surprise and handed me across the table a leather\nnote book open at page twelve and thirteen and there we\nfound an extract which was plainly what she had been\ntold to look for. It described the sensations of a man who\nhad died, or nearly died. I have forgotten it exactly, but\nI know it described a man whose spirit was passing away,\nand what he felt when he saw the faces of his jjeople\nround his bed. And on turning to the front pages of the\nbook we found the diagram of languages which had been\nmentioned in his effort to describe through the medium\nwhich book the extract was in, for it appears there were\ntwo books somewhat similar.\nTo us my sister's interview seemed intensely interesting\nand I have written it down as far as I can exactly how\nI remember it.\n(Signed) Mabel Fitzmatjrice.\nDecember 20, 1917.\nIt is evident that even the discovery of the diagram\nof languages revived no recollection in Mrs. Talbot of\never having seen it before, and this makes it difficult\nto suppose that the knowledge shown by the communi-\ncator was derived telepathically from her. At the same\n\f260 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ntime it will be generally agreed I think that the coin-\ncidence is quite beyond what can reasonably be attributed\nto chance. Further, the quotation on page 13 of the\nnotebook seems quite appropriate ; and we may even\nregard it as probable that had contemporary notes been\ntaken of what was said at the sitting, the truth of the\nstatement attributed to the communicator that the quota-\ntion \" would be so interesting after this conversation\n\"\nwould have been still more apparent. The incident\nmust, 1 think, rank among the best single pieces of\ndefinite evidence we have for memory of their earth life\nin communicators, and therefore of personal identity. But\nit is scarcely, strictly speaking, a book-test.\n\u00a7 3.\n\u2022\nMrs. Beados's Book-Tests and Comments thereon.\nThe interesting incident just described is not a book-test\nproper because it does not furnish evidence of know-\nledge by the communicator of present facts not within\nhis memory, nor within the knowledge of living human\nbeings. Of this there are no specimens among the book-\ntests so striking as either the vision of the picture described\nin \u00a7 1, which may have been derived either from telepathy\nor from memory, or as Mrs. Talbot's test described in \u00a7 2,\nwhich looks like a case of memory. Still there are some\nstriking cases, and to some of these we may proceed.\nI will begin with the' book-test received on September 29,\n1917, by Mrs. Beadon, the lady who, as mentioned above,\nintroduced Mrs. Talbot to Mrs. Leonard. The communi-\ncator was her husband, Colonel Beadon. Mrs. Beadon\nreports Feda as saying :\nIn a squarish room some books in the corner, not quite\nin the corner but running by the wall to the corner from\nthe window a row of books. (Feda indicated by a gesture\nof her hand a shelf across a corner and said '\nit is not\nthat.') Counting from right to left the fifth book, p. 71.\nFeda is not sure if it is 17 or 71. (After repeating both\n\fLXXXI.J An Examination of Book-Tests. 261\nnumbers several times Feda says she is sure it is page 71\n\u2014\nsecond paragraph or about middle of the page.) On page 71\nwill be found a message from him to you. The message\nwill not be as beautiful as he would like to make it, but\nyou will understand he wants to make the test as good\nas he can. On the same shelf is a book in dirtyish\nbrown cover and a reddish book and an old fashioned\nbook.\n(1) It refers to a past condition\n(2) But has also an ajiplication to the present.\n(3) It is an answer to a thought which was much more\nin your mind at one time than it is now,\u2014a question\nwhich was once much in your mind, but is not now,\nespecially since you have known Feda.\n(4) On the opposite page is a reference to fire.\n(5) On the opposite side is a reference to light.\n(6) On the opposite side is a reference to olden times.\n\u2014\nThese have nothing to do with the message but are just\ntests that you have the right page.\n(7) On the same page or Opposite page or perhaps over\nthe leaf a very important word begimiing with S.\n(I asked if it was the top shelf, and Feda said \" yes.\"\nIt turned out that there was only one shelf.)\nVerification\n.\nSix out of the seven indications of the message are\nfound to be clear.\nThe room proved to be the dining room of [address\ngiven] my mother's house where I was staying temporarily.\nMrs. Leonard had never been inside the house at all.\nThere was a book shelf across the corner as well as the\none on which the test book was to be found. The room\nwas not square ; one end was squared, the other end\noctagonal. There was an old volume of Dryden's poems\nand the others as described on the same shelf. The fifth\nbook from right to left was a volume of poems by Oliver\nWendell Holmes (Routledge pocket library edition). I had\nnever read 0. W. Holmes' poems\u2014Page 71 and 17 had\nthe same thought expressed on both.\n\f262 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nPage 71, second paragraph, has the following:\n\" The weary pilgrim slumbers,\nHis resting place unknown,\nHis hands were crossed, his lids were closed,\nThe dust was o'er him strown ;\nThe drifting soil, the mouldering leaf\nAlong the sod were blown.\nHis mound has melted into Earth\nHis memory lives alone.\"\n[The commmiicator] was killed in action in Mesopotamia.\nHe was buried by chaplain and officers the same night\nnear where he fell. The officer in charge wrote that all\ntraces of the grave had been carefully obliterated to avoid\ndesecration by the Arabs.\n(1) The poem (\" The Pilgrim's Vision \") refers to early\nsettlers in America\u2014\" refers to a past condition.\"\n(2) It has an apjalication in this verse to the com-\nmunicator's own case. He received reverent burial, his\nresting place unknown\n(3) It was a question in my mind constantly at one\ntime whether it would be possible to identify the spot\nwith the help of the officers present, and when the war is\nover to mark it with a cross. I have thought very little\nof that lately and have not felt concerned as I did at\nfirst that his grave was unmarked and unknown.\nOn the opposite page is the following verse ;\n(4) Still shall the fiery pillar's ray\nAlong the pathway shine,\n(5) To fight the chosen tribe that sought\n(6) This Western Palestine.\nThe reference to fire, light and the journey of the\nIsraelites fulfils (4), (5) and (6).\n(7) The important word beginning with S I cannot place\ndefinitely. This is the only point that is micertain. Out\nof seven indications six are fulfilled. [Mrs. Beadon has\nsince informed us that there is a poem caUed \" The\nSteamboat \" on the next page, that this title headed the\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 263\npage in capital letters, and the page was all about steam-\nboats. This was her first book-test and. she was very\ncritical, otherwise she does not think she would have said\nshe could not trace the im]Dortant word beginning with\n\" S \" on the next page. At the time she thought it far-\nfetched to take it as more than a comcidence, but now\nshe thinks it is what was intended. And certainly it\ncorresponds to the statement made about it. It is an\nimportant word on the page, if not connected with the\nmessage.]\nMrs. Beadon goes on to point out that on page 17, the\nother page mentioned by Feda, the subject of an un-\nmarked grave also occurs, but near the bottom of the\npage ; and on the opposite page appear the words fire\nand sunset glow. Between these two pages, 17 and 71,\nshe could not find any page which fulfilled the conditions\nof the message at all.\nThe appropriate verse on p. 17 is ;\nThe Indian's shaft, the Briton's ball,\nThe sabre's thirstmg edge.\nThe hot shell shattering in its fall.\nThe bayonet's rending wedge,\nHere scattered death ;\nyet seek the spot,\nNo trace thine eye can see.\nNo altar,\u2014and they need it not\nWho leave their children free.\n]\\'Irs. Beadon tells us that this seems to her more\nappropriate in some w^ays than the verse on p. 71 ; and\nthough agreeing with what is said below about Feda's\nfrequent uncertainty as to which way to place the numerals\nforming the page number\u2014of which she has herself had\nexperience\u2014she w-rites :\nIn this case I got the impression from [Feda] that\n\" they \" on the other side had chosen both [pages] and\nwere uncertam which to proceed mth. ... It seems to\nme that page 17 gave the main message far the best.\nBut on p. 71 they were able to give more of the secondary\ntests that strengthen it. Taking both 17 and 71 leaves\n\f264 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part i\nno room for doubt as to the message, or for coincidence.\n'\nMy reasons for preferring page 17 are\n[I.] that it is essentially a soldier's message about a i\nbattlefield. Page 17 gives the conditions of a battlefield i\nand hot fighting. , i\nII. It mentions \" the Indian's shaft, the Briton's ball.\"\nIt was a feature of the war in Mesopotamia that mixed |\ntroops were employed\n\u2014\nIndian and British brigaded to- \u2022\ngether. My husband was commanding Indian troops.\n|\nIII. Above all I was told the main message was about i\na question that had occupied my mind a good deal and \\\ntroubled me at one time. This question was whether it\nwould be possible to erect a memorial. This is answered I\non p. 17. \" No altars\u2014and they need them not who leave i\ntheir children free.\" I felt this was what they wanted\nto say\u2014that their achievement would be their best\nmemorial.\nOn p. 71 there is no reference to its being a soldier's i\nmessage, no reference to a battlefield. Nor is there any j\nreference to the main Cjuestion\u2014 altars \" or memorials |\nto- their fame. I felt the expression ''weary pilgrim\"\nvery inapplicable to the state of mind expressed in his\nletters, written uj) to the very day before he was killed.\nSo altogether I feel page 17 gave the message and p. 71\nstrengthened and supplemented it. ,1\nThat both these pages should be as appropriate as they\nare is in any case very remarkable, and Mrs. Beadon's 1\nreasons for believing both to have been intentionally re-\nj\nferred to seem to me strong. If she is right, this double\nj\nreference is very interesting and important. It must,\nhowever, be borne in mind that the kind of hesitation\nthat Feda showed here in deciding between two pages |\nwith numbers of which the component numerals are in )\nreversed order, is often shown by her in other cases when j\nit is in no way justified by the content of the pages.\nFor instance, on September 25, 1918, in an A. V. B. j\ntest, Feda says : I\n\" What she wants you to look for is the 4th book from |\nthe left, on the floor. Wait a minute, Ladye, two ? Can't\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 265\nsee it Ladye ! Three eight, three eight, eight three ? Yes,\neight three, half \\\\'ay down, she says not only halfway\ndown, but all that part just there seems to speak not\nonly of a place, but also of an environment that you and\nLadye had been in on the earth plane. Now Mrs. Twonnie\n[Feda's name for M. R. H.] that's right, and she hopes it\nwill be interesting ; 'cos she says it is evidential, 'cos it\ndoes speak about a place, and it's personally evidential,\n'cos it speaks of a place that's connected with her. [Feda\nadds that on the opposite page at the top] she certainly\nthought she'd got a word that conveyed stockings to her.\nThis test, in spite of apparent definiteness, was a com-\nplete failure. Nothing relevant was found on either\npage 83 or 38, nor on pages opposite. Feda seems on\nother occasions to recognise a difficulty about the order\nof the figures as one generally affecting her. Thus she\nsays in an A. V. B. sitting on September 11, 1918 :\n\" Page two 0, twenty ; that's a nice number, 'cos\nit couldn't be 0 two, you see.\" ^ Whether the difficulty\nis genuine is of course another question. It may be\npart of Fela's affectation of childishness. On the other\nhand, as I have suggested further on (p. 365), it may\nperhaps be explained by the fact that the numerals\nconstituting the number are sometimes perceived by Feda\nas built up separately by the communicator.\nTo go back to Mrs. Beadon, there seems, so far as we\ncan judge from eight sittings, to have been a propor-\ntion of success considerably above the average in the\nbook-tests received by her. 2 One very successful one\noccurred in the course of a communication too private\nto be reported to us, though Lady Troubridge was\n1 Other cases of doubt on Feda's part as to the order of the numerals\nwill be found below.\n- The fact mentioned above (p. 244) that each sitter has his or her\nspecial communicator and that for book-test purposes they form an\ninseparable pair, prevents our being able to judge whether a higher\naverage of success, such as Mrs. Beadon's, is due to quaUties in the\ncommunicator, or the sitter, or the combination of the two. It is true\nthat M. R. H. and U. V. T. had at their sittings a communicator\ncommon to both, but they were almost always both present\u2014one as\nsitter and one as note-taker.\n\f266 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ninformed in confidence of the evidence concerning the\nbook-test. Here is another \" message \" received on March\n16, 1918. Mrs. Beadon reports :\nFeda. \" A single row of books over a window \" (aside Feda\nsaid \" You mean beside a window of course\u2014people do\nnot put books over windows\u2014no ? \") \"He will have it\nthat tlie books are over a ^vindow.

Is there a smik in look about this window ?\nMr. Will does not know how else to describe it but you\nv\/iU know what he means by sunk in.\"\nAbout this description Mrs. Beadon says :\nIn the library at [Mrs. Beadon's house] there is a single row\nof books over each of two small windows. The window panes\nare a fancy shape heavily set m lead which makes a ridge\nround each pane. The windows are on each side of the\nfire place hi a recess sunk back from the rest of the room.\nAfter statements\u2014one right and one wrong\u2014about a\npicture and a date in another book \" a little further\nto the right,\" the report continues :\nFeda. \" The books are on the left and you must count 3rd\nbook from the left, p. 92. It is a message about the Uttle girl\nwhose foot was being treated.^ It is what he is wishing and\ndesirmg for her. He is very much interested in this test-\nit is that which he hopes she will attain while she is in\nthe physical body. He wants her to, and he thinks she will.\"\nTaking the books over the left-hand window and count-\ning the 3rd book from the left is a volume of a set of\nCowper's poems. Page 92 has this verse :\nFarewell\u2014endued with all that could engage\nAll hearts to love thee, both in youth and age,\nIn prime of life, for sprighthness enroU'd\nAmong the gay, yet virtuous as the old.^\n1 This child, aged seven, and the remedial treatment, had been referred\nto by the communicator at a previous sitting.\n2 These are \"Lines composed for a memorial of Ashley Cowper, Esq.,\"\nand they occur on the 92nd page of Vol. III. of Cowper's poems\npublished in London by Baldwin Cradock & Joy in 1817.\n\fLXXXI.] A)i Examination of Book-Tests. 267\nThis corresponds quite appropriately to the description\nof the \" message.\" But unfortunately Feda went on to\nspeak of\n\" Page 73 (about half way down he thinks) is almost\nhke an allusion to her foot \u2014read it quite literally. It\nis almost as if it gave a clue to the identity of the child.\"\nand at this place Mrs. Beadon found nothing appropriate.\nA failure like this accompanying closely a success cannot\nbut weaken our estimate of the latter, and this sort of\nmixture is common in the book-tests we are- examining,\nthough I think it occurs less in Mrs. Beadon's than in\nthose received by other sitters. It is impossible to say\nin a case like this whether some passage in a book was\nreally perceived by the communicator but its whereabouts\nwrongly described, or whether the whole thing was\nimagination. It may have been pure invention or guess-\ning on Feda's part, but if we accept as not accidental\nthe success in the same sitting, it seems probable that\nthe erroneous impression also seemed to Feda to reach\nher from a source outside herself. If it did we may\nsuppose that she misunderstood and repeated wrongly\nwhat she was told. There are obviously several oppor-\ntunities for error, besides misapprehension of the passage\nalluded to ; for the room, or the shelf, or the place\nof the book in the shelf, or the number of the page,\nor the part of the page on which the message occurs\nmay be wrongly described.\nA rather curious instance of persistent failure to\ndescribe, or at least to bring to the minds of the sitters,\nthe place where the book in question was to be found,\noccurred to M. R. H. and U. V. T. in September 1917.\nA book-test was given and elaborated on September 5 and\nat two subsequent sittings, it being stated that the\nbook was at a flat which the two ladies had visited.\nBut they have been quite unable to identify the flat.\nIn this instance and others^ it is possible perhaps that\n^ Mrs. Stuart Wilson was given a book-test on .January 31, 1918,\nbut she was quite unable to find the book-ease, thougli its supposed\nsurroundings were elaborately described and she tried several houses.\n\f268 Mrs. Henry Siclgwick. [part\nthe failure was in the memory of the sitters. In the\nfollowing instance, however\u2014and in some others\u2014it is\nclear that the description was in fault. Mr. G. H. S.,\non June 2, 1917, was told by Feda :\nShe wants you when you get home to go to the room\nwhere the books are. She is showing Feda a dark room\nwith books all round it and she is pointing to the third\nbook on the second shelf from the floor, quite close to the\ndoor ;\nand she says on page 19 you will find a message\nfrom her. ,\nMr. G. H. S., who, in the course of the sitting, had\nhad some communications from the same communicator\nwhich seem to have been remarkably veridical, says\nabout this : \"I felt that this was padding, as there is\nno such room or bookcase ...\" And in reply to further\nenquiries he says :\nI have carefully examined the book indicated in every\nbook-case in the house, and there is no possibility of\nresult. I think the whole section wrong because the tone\nof the voice was quite lifeless and different during this\nsection,! and the detailed description of the room where\nthe books were supposed to be (much more detailed than\nI have rej)roduced it) was quite obviously wrong, so far as\nconcerns every house in which I have lived.\nThis failure in a rather good sitting is more interest-\ning than similar failures experienced by sitters who have\nreceived no communications, or hardly any, affording\nevidence of supernormal knowledge. I may remark here\nthat, as far as I can learn, the bad book-tests in the\ncollection before us usually occur at sittings otherwise\npoor. The most successful sitters may of course at\ntimes have very poor sittings, and they may at times\nreceive elaborate book-tests consisting of a considerable\nnumber of items, which give no good results at all.\nThere are sometimes indications pointing to genuine\nmistakes or confusion as distinct from random state-\n1 Sitters who have sat often witli Mrs. Leonard tell me that this\nlifeless kind of voice does not always mean failure in commimication.\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 269\nments. For instance, as regards this point of the book-\nshelves meant, Mrs. Beadon had the following experience.\nOn November 24, 1917, which was apparently her next\nsitting to that of September 29, at which the book-\ntest described above (page 260) was given, the communi-\ncator made a remark abont that test being all right\nexcept one point. A little discussion about it followed\ntill Feda said :\n\" He is afraid he is getting the conditions of the test\nmixed with the one he wants to give you to-day. He is\nafraid it will spoil it.\"\n(I said we had better leave it alone and get the new\ntest.) Feda was afraid they had got it mixed with the\nconditions of the former test. She said \" Anyway it is the\nsame shelf\u2014the same place as last time.\"\nParticulars follow about other books on the shelf, and\nthen \" Left to right second book page 39 is a message.*'\nOf this some description is given, and Feda proceeds :\n\" He thinks . . . about page 3 is a reference to some place\nwhere you were together long ago\u2014before you were\nmarried.\" Mrs. Beadon went at once to her mother's\nhouse, where was the shelf on Avhich was the book of the\nprevious test, but there was nothing at all on that\nshelf to correspond with the test.\" In her room at her\nown house \" there is a book-shelf in the corner running\ntowards the window \" which she believes to be the one\nthat should have been given. All the particulars given\nabout the titles, etc., of other books besides the test-\nbook were appropriate ; and if we may regard the\nsecond and tliird books from the left as amalgamated, the\nmessages were right too\u2014the third page of the second\nbook having on it the name of an appropriate place,\nand page 39 of the thix'd book an appropriate mes-\nsage. There is too much error here for us to use the\ncase as evidential, but there is a method in the errors\nwhich certainly suggests mistakes or confusion rather\nthan reckless statements aided by chance.\nLater in this paper I discuss some similar methodical\nerrors as regards volumes and pages.\n\f270 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\n\u00a7 4.\nInstances of Statements about Words or Sentences\nIN A Closed Book which turn out to be Verbally\nAccurate.\nI propose now to give some cases\u2014there are not very many\nand they are of different values evidentially-\u2014where a\nstatement that a particular word or sentence is to be\nfound in a particular part of a particular book is found\nto be correct\u2014cases where there is no vagueness as to\nthe message.\nBut before doing so I may remark that it not in-\nfrequently happens that what Feda says about one page\nturns out to be true not of that page but of the pre-\nceding or following page. For this she and the com-\nmunicators have their explanations, which we shall have\nto consider later when dealing with their theories as to the\nmode of perception. In the meanwhile it must be\nremembered that by allowing the two pages adjacent\nto the one named to count, we multiply the chances\nof accidental success by three.\nThe first case in chronological order which I shall\nquote occurred in a sitting the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas\nhad on November 8, 1917. He reports :\n\" Another book test ; the same bookshelf as the last and\nthe fifth book on the shelf. Page 65 will have a reference\nto contrast in shades of colour. Take literally.\"\n[On reaching home and examining the shelf Mr. Thomas]\n\" noticed that there remained the empty space whence . .\nthe previous week's test book had been taken.

On p. 64\nfacing page 65 was found the sentence :]\n\" Don't we all\nIvnow the woman who is fond of pink, who adores pink\nroses and chiffons, and wears them blandly with pre-\nposterous shades of green and blue.\"\n^ The mode of counting adopted here was it will be observed the\nreverse of that adopted by M. R. H. and U. V. T. on Sept. 12, 1917 ;\nsee above, p. 232.\n\fLxxxi.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 271\nIn this case we cannot at any rate complain of want\nof definiteness, though we must admit doubt as to the\nbook intended.\nThe next I will take occurred at an A. V. B. sitting\non November 21, 1917. It was a failure in spite of the\nstriking coincidence, for the word was not found in the\nright book, but it may possibly be instructive. Feda\nsaid that in the fitst book in the right-hand corner at\nabout a height indicated, in a certain book-case, on\npage 12 figures one and two that makes twelve \")\nnear the top of the page would be found \" Charleroi,^\na name like that. It sounds like Charleroi . . . lower\ndown nearer the middle is where the message is.\"\" Some-\nthing is then said about the message, and two other\nstatements made about things to be found on that page\nor possibly the next. Nothing whatever that could, be\nconsidered applicable was found in the book and page\nindicated. But in describing the shelf Feda had said\nthat Ladye \" shows books in a row, and it seems as if\nthere's another book pushed behind it.\"' Now this\nwas not true in the case of the shelf indicated by its\nheight from the ground, but it was true of the shelf\nabove this, and of no other shelf in the bookcase. The\nbook behind the others was towards the left-hand end\nof the shelf, and this led to the first book at the left-\nhand end of this sheK being examined. There was\nnothing relevant on page 12, but on page 13 facing it\nand at the top of the page was the word Charolois.\" ^\nThe coincidence was certainly remarkable, and it is curious\nthat the indications given .should have led, though in a\nround about way, to the word. On the other hand,\nthere was nothing else on the pages in question corres-\nponding to what Feda had said, and this of course\nweighs on the side of the coincidence being accidental.\nThe next case I will take\u2014following chronological\norder\u2014occurred in an A. V. B. sitting on January 2,\nThis was the notetaker's contemporary rendering of Feda's pro-\nnunciation of a name evidently foreign.\n- The book was a volume of Carlyle's French Bevolution.\n\f272 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\n1918. The items of the book-test were fairly successful\nall through. After giving \" messages \" from two books\nFeda contimies :\n%\nOn p. 57 of the first book there is something rather\nmore personal than the rest that she's given to-day. It's\nnear the bottom of the page, and she says there's a\ndistinct httle message there, which she would like you to\nhold like a little light in front of j^ou as coming from her,\na little light to show you the Avay through the difficulties\nwhich have been, and are encompassing you. She says\nthat sometimes she thinks of herself as, or rather it is\nthat she tries to be, a little light so as to attract your\neyes, so that while your feet are stumbling over obstacles,\nyour eyes are fixed on a light that you foUoAV.\nThe book was Chronique du Regne de Charles IX.,\nby P. Merimee, and in the three last lines of p. 57\nare the words :\n\" Quelques figures s'y montraient un\ninstant avec des lumieres et clisparaissaient aussitot.\"\nWhat I have taken as definite in the description of the\n\" message \" is the word light. It is, however, not stated\nthat this word will be found in the \" message,\" and I\nshould hardly have taken this as a specimen of a word\nbeing definitely indicated and found, had it not been\nfor another message about lights on August 24, 1918,\nwhich I will quote presently. First, I must quote from\nthe report of the sitters on the book-test of January 2,\n1918\u2014the one now under discussion\u2014what they say about\nthe topic of the \" little light,\" as it shows that there\nwas an appropriateness which would not otherwise be\nobvious. They say :\nWe will turn to a recurrence of this topic of the \" little\nlight\" wliich is to be ' found during the A. V. B. control\nwhich followed the Feda Control during the sitting. . . .\nThese are the words upon which we must rivet our\nattention. A. V. B. is speaking to M. R. H. and says :\n\" Have you seen a little light again ? because I've tried to\nshow you a little light several times, and once I thought\nyou saw it, it was quite lately.\" M. R. H. replied \" Yes,\nI told Una about it.\" A. V. B. said :\n\" I think you were\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 273\nwriting at the time.\" ... It was correct to say that\nM. R. H. was writing at the time when she observed the\nlight, and apropos of this, M. R. H. remarked : ''I must\nbe getting clairvoyant.\" Towards the end of the control\nA. V. B. returned to the subject of the light, saying that\nwhen M. R. H. saAv it it was because she, A. V. B., was\nshowing it ;\napropos of the light A. V. B. remarked \" that's\nme.\" She said further that she could not always hold the\nlight that she showed very long. Or rather,\" she added,\naddressing M. R. H., \" You cannot hold it in the ether.\"\nWe have in these two references to a little light given,\nfirst during the Feda control [in the book-test] and then\nduring the A. V. B. control, a mixture of the literal and\nmetaphorical.\nThe A. V. B book-test given nearly eight months\nlater\u2014on August 24, 1918\u2014was very like the one just\ndescribed, but the \" message \" about lights was more\ndefinite and successful, though some other statements\nmade were not true. As on Jatiuary 2, reference apart\nfrom the book-test was made in the course of the sitting\nto lights seen. Almo.st at the beginning of the sitting\nFeda said :\nShe says did you know she'd been trying to show\nyou lights while you was away ? She tried three\ntimes.\nM. R. H. What does she think she produced ?\nFeda. She thinks she did produce something, but not quite\na usual one. She says she Avanted to produce\na usual one, but she didn't l-aiow why but it\nseemed in a way to alter when she manifested it.\nTo start Avith, she says it wasn't blue, sh-e seemed\nto get from you that it wasn't.\nM. R. H. That's quite right.\nU. V. T. From which of us did you get that impression ?\nFeda. From you Mrs. Twonnie. She showed it three times,\nbut she thought IMrs. Una (U. V. T.) saw it as\nwell, in fact she says there was an occasion when\nMrs. Una saw it a.nd you didn't.\nM. R. H. That's quite correct.\n\fMrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nShe says isn't it funny, she thought she was making ,\na blue one, and didn't know it wasn't blue till\n|\nshe got it from you afterwards ; she says she was f\nspeaking of it to some one afterwards, and they i\nsaid that that was how materialised spirits often\n^\ndidn't look the same as they thought they did.\n^\nShe's quite right, I saw them on one or two occa-\nsions and Una did too.\n'\nr\nCommenting on this, M. R. H. and U. V. T. state i\nthat both\nare in the habit from time to time of seeing hallucina- ^\ntory lights . . . which usually take the form of sudden 1\nsmall blue sparks [and] are purported to come according j\nto the Leonard phenomena from A. V. B. . . . During j\ntheir holiday prior to this present sitting M. R. H. and i\nU. V. T. had both seen these lights, though unfortunately '\nnever at the same time. . . . After having given the book- i\n(\ntest, which she did towards the end of the Feda control, j\nA. V. B. again returned to the subject of her \" spirit t\nlights \" during her personal control at the end of the !\nsitting, when she said that U. V. T. had been excited i\nwhen she saw one of the lights, and impUed that she had \\\nbeen a little startled. That statement was correct, for\nj\nU. V. T. had seen a light over the foot of M. R. H.'s bed\nj\nthat had not in the least resembled anything that she had |\npreviously witnessed, it was much larger being about the \\\nsize of a large grape fruit but oval in shape and somewhat i\nyellow in colour.\n^ j\nTo return to the book-test, Feda, after describing the 1\nshelf, says :\n|l I\nIt's the first '\nbook counting from left to right. ...\nPage three six, thirty-six\u2014wait a minute Ladye\u2014halfway i\ndown, there's a message there . . . showing something \\\nabout the\u2014while you were away\u2014wait a minute\u2014she says\n|\nyou'll have to put several dashes before you've finished !\n|\nIt refers to the lights she showed\u2014it's rather a funny one,\nbut it refers in quite an appropriate way to the lights she\nshowed. She says joerhaps it's not exactly comic, but you'll\nI\n274\nFeda.\nM. R. H.\n\fLXXXI.] A71 Examination of Bool-Tests. 275\nthink it's a quaint way for her to have put it. Above it on\nthe same page, quite close to it is a funny word which\nseemed to her like Daemonee or Demonees. . . .\nOn p. 36 of the book indicated ^ beginning on the\nfifteenth line from the top in a page of twenty-seven\nlines occur the following words :\n\" Over it from time to time swift flashes of light would\nrise and tremble in the gloom like will-o'-the-wisps over a\nchurch yard.\"\nNo word like \" demonees \" appears on the page, and\nthis statement must be reckoned as definitely wrong.\nIf, however, \" demons \" was the idea, there is something\nsuggestive of such beings in the scene described. The\nfollowing is the description in a shortened form :\n\"... ghostly poplars . . . night was gloomy and chilly,\na low weird wind . . . night-bird shrieked painfully . .\nFar out in front the carnage was in full swing, the red\nfury of war . . . and darts of flame, ghastly red . . .\nRound Fitzgerald was the flat dead country, black and\nlimitless, and over it from time to time swift flashes of\nlight,\" etc.\nAssuming real perception of the pages of a closed book\nto be possible, can we suppose such perception to be a\nmixture of the vague and the definite such as may\nenable the operating intelligence to select deliberately a\nsentence about flashes of light, and at the same time\nto get an impression from the general sense of the page\nthat a word like demon occurs in it ?\nContinuing the consideration of book-tests in which\nverbal exactness is shown, and returning to chronological\norder disturbed by the obvious advantage of taking the\ntwo cases about \" lights \" together, I will take next\none that occurred at an A. V. B. sitting on March 6,\n^ The book was The Brown Brethren by Patrick MacGill, London,\n1917, and had not been opened or read by either of the sitters. It\nwas one of a lot of second-hand books bought to fill this particular\nbook-case with unread books with a view to book-test experiments.\nI\n\f276 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\n1918. Perhaps we can hardly say that exact verbal\ncorrespondence is shown between the description given\nand the passage indicated, but it is at any rate some-\nthing very near it. The sitters are told to look in the\nbook-case in M. R. H.'s study\u2014second shelf up, the\nthird book from left to right.\nthe page called two eight, twenty eight, near the top, is\na message, what she thinks you and Mrs. Twonnie think\nabout the new feeding rules, and the dire consequences\nthereof. That's a silly message ! You'll recognise it as it's\nsomething what she heard you saying, she says it describes\nit exactly.\nThe book proved to be the second volume of Carlyle's\nFrederick the Great (London : Chapman and Hall). There\nwas nothing relevant on p. 28, but on p. 27, which is at\nthe back of p. 28 on the same leaf, in lines 3 to 5,\noccur the words :\n\" What pleasure there can be in having\nyour household arrangements tumbled into disorder every\nNew Year, by a new-contrived scale of expenses for\nyou I never could ascertam.\" M. R. H. and U. V. T.\ntell us that they had constantly said lately that the\nfood problem was becoming past a joke, as one never\nknew where one was with regard to finances.\nThe next example occurred, again in an A. V. B.\nsitting, on April 3, 1918, when the word \" music \" was\nindicated, and found in the passage referred to. The\nbook as described was the sixth from left to right on a\ncertain shelf. Feda continues :\nThe page what is called twenty eight, the lower part of\nthe page (s.v. something that will remind you of her\nmusic). She doesn't mean that it will be just a little\nreminder, but something that will definitely refer to her\nmusic. And page forty, same book, near top, something\nshe hoped people did not think of her music : she\nhoped they didn't regard her music in that light. And\npage 72 near the top as well, the way she hojaed they did\nthink of it.\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 277\nVerification.\nUpon p. 28, eighth line from the bottom, appear the words\n\" an occasional wisp of music.\"\nUpon p. 40 nothing relevant was found, but on p. 39,\nat the back of page 40, on the ninth line from the\ntop occur the words : \"It only disgusts me !\n\"\nUpon p. 72, seventh and eighth lines from the top,\noccur the words :\n\" She thrashed her own heart that\nthrough her hands it might warm his.\" On the face\nof it these last words do not appear very relevant, but\nthey might perhaps be regarded as referring metaphoric-\nally to emotional playing and singing, and A. V. B.\nwas noted for putting heart and feeling into her singing.\nOther statements made in connection with book-tests\non this occasion were some more or less right and some\nwrong.\nThe next book-test which we may call verbally exact\nthat I shall quote was an A. W. V. (see p. 244) one given\non April 23, 1918. The sitter, Mrs. Salter, recorded for\nherself, and the communicator A. W. Verrall professed to\nbe helped by A. V. B. The book-test which consisted of\nseveral items was interesting throughout though not always\ncorrect, and the interest is added to by the fact that\nthe books referred to were in M. R. H.'s flat, which up\nto that time had never been visited by Mxs. Salter.\nThe item that concerns us now is the following. The\nrow of books meant having been clearly indicated, Feda\nsays :\nThe second book from the left he thinks on the first\npage\u2014he's practically sure it's the first page\u2014he says it's\nrather silly but they noticed it\u2014all the matter on that\npage has a kind of j)lay on Mrs. Twonnie's name\u2014her\nsurname. Isn't that a funny one ? It actually mentions\nsomething that is her name. He doesn't think the first\npage is a full page it's part of a page. It mentions her\nname in another sense.\nThere was nothing relevant in the second book on\nthe shelf ; but if we may take \" the second book from\n\f278 Mrs. Henry Sidgivich. [part\nthe left \" as meaning the second book from the previously\nmentioned one from which two tests had been given\nand which was itself the fourth book from the left-\nhand end of the row, the book referred to was II Salotto\ndella Coyitessa Maffei, by R. Barbiera (jNIilan, 1914).\nThis mode of counting was, there is some reason to\nbelieve, adopted by A. W. V. on February 28, 1918,\nand it is explicitly mentioned as a possible one on April\n11, 1918, when Feda reports A. W. V. as saying: \"The\nfifth book, not the fifth from the first, but counting the\nfirst.\" The ambiguity is to be regretted, but assuming\nII Salotto della Contessa Maffei to be the book meant,\n\" Salotto \" must be the word. It occurs no less than\nsix times on the first page, though only half of that\npage is covered in print. In the Italian dictionary\nconsulted it is given under Sala thus :\n\" Sala dim.\nsalotto, etc., aug. salone, a hall or saloon, the principal\nroom of the house.\" This seems to justify the assertion\nthat \" Salotto \" represents M. R. H.'s (Miss Radclyffe\nHaU's) name. \" After all,\" as Mrs. Salter says, \" the\ncommunicators were not setting out to give us a scholarly\nrendering of Italian. They were only making '\na kind\nof play '\non the name Hall, and a certain license is\nalways permitted in puns.'\n\"\nIt detracts somewhat from the value of this book-test,\nas a book-test in the strictest sense, that the word\n\" Salotto \" appears in the title on the back of the book,\nthough rather inconspicuously. It cannot possibly have\nbeen in the sitter's (Mrs. Salter's) mind, however, as she\nhad not seen the books and knew nothing about them,\nexcept that, a good many book-tests having been taken\nfrom books in M. R. H.'s study, the latter had recently\nsubstituted a fresh set of books. Mrs. Salter did not\neven know that some of the new books were Italian\nones. She and Mrs. Leonard were alone on this occasion.\nMrs. Leonard had never been in M. R. H.'s study.\nThe next instance I shall describe occurred in an\nA. V. B. sitting of May 15, 1918, and concerns names.\nThe book-tests were said to be given jointly by A. V. B.\n\fliXXXi.] An Examination of BooJc-Tests.\nand A. W. Verrall. In the course of them A. W. V. says\nthat he thinks of M. R. H., U. V. T., and ^s. Salter\nas the bridge builders. Feda continues :\nF. He says bridges can't be builted from one side\nonly, he says it must be prepared from both banks,\nand he says everything that is done in the way\nof Psychical manifestation, always has to be\ndone from both banks ; it's an alternative name\nfor you [s.v. Bridge builders !). Feda thuiks\nthat's a nice name ! Now, about the middle of\nthat second shelf down, there's a book whose title\nsuggests what it is youre spamimg by buildmg\nthe bridge. Spanning ? Yes, what you are span-\nning over, he says, is a better way to put it, by\nbuilding the bridge. He thinks that one ought to\njump at you, it ought to be a very easy one to\nfind, ifs what you're bridging over, what you're\nehminating by building the bridge. Now, when\nyou've got that book,\u2014Mr. Arthur's [Feda's name\nfor Dr. Verrall] found the book, but there is a bit\nmore in it than that. Ladye says, take the book\nout and open it, and inside the book, at the\nvery beginning {s.v. Ar-lett-er-sia). It doesn't\nstart with R, it starts A^dth Let, as near as Feda\ncan get it, ifs hke Leticier, it's a word that the\nbook is about, but it should be mentioned at the\nbeginning part ; it's a funny sounding name.\nM.

It was a happy period, not ?^whappy.\nBut Ladye says that all the early part was happy,\neven though for a while she was anxious about\nyou, she was anxious about you, it was a happy time.\nNo appropriate title was found exactly in the middle\nof the shelf, but the seventh book from the exact middle\ntowards the left was called The Unseen World, which,\nsince it is between this world and the unseen world that\nthe metaphorical bridge extends, seems sufficiently to\nfulfil the requirements. The subject-matter of the book\nconfirms this, for as M. R. H.\n'\nand U. V. T. put it :\n\"The whole object of the book is to point out in most\nunmeasured terms the fact that an absolutely impassable\ngtdf lies between those in this world and those in the\nnext.\" The author of this book is Alexius M. Lepicier,\nwhose name appears on the title page,i and also upon\nthe page prior to the preface in a paragraph consisting\nof the written authority from Rome for the publication\nof the book. The resemblance of Leticier and Lepicier\nseems too close to be attributed to chance, and Feda's\npronunciation of the name was rendered by the\nnote-taker before verification.^ The syllable rendered\n\" Ar \" in the first attempt at the name may have been\nmeant for the initial of the Christian name*^ pronounced\nas it would be in French. The book, however, is in\nEnglish, and there is no indication of its being a trans-\nlation, though the name of the author is apparently\nFrench. Feda is, of course, wrong when she says that\n\" Leticier is a word that the book is about.\" In -this\nconnexion something said at the next A. V. B. sitting\n(May 22, 1918) may be referred to. Feda said:\nShe wants to explain she's got to be very careful, 'cos\nonce or twice when she's been sensing what she's thought\nlit also appears without initials of Christian names on the back of\nthe book, which fact, as in the last case, diminishes the value of the\ntest as a book-test in the strict sense.\n2 The note-taker (U. V. T.'s) first impression was that Feda was\ntrying to say the English Christian name Letitia with an \" s\n\" sound\ninstead of an \" sh \" sound to the second \" t.\" This she corrected\nto \" Leticier.\" .\n\fLXXXI.] A71 Exarnination of Book-Tests. 281\nwas only the title of a book, she's got the name of the\nauthor. On one occasion at any rate, she got the name\nof the author mixed up with it, and thought that it was\npart of the title, and she would like you to be prepared\nfor that, in case she does it again. . . . Do you know\nshe's sure that on one occasion the name of the author\nsuggested more to her than the title, and if they happens\nto be very close together she's very likely to get 'em\nmixed up, 'cos she senses a little run right through. And\nshe says if, as sometimes happens, the author's name is\nonly on the inside\n\u2014\n(s.v. It don't happen) she says yes it\ndoes\u2014she wouldn't be so likely to get it mixed.\nIt is thought by M. R. H. and U. V. T. that these\nwords probably refer to the mistake made a week before\nin connection with Lepicier,\" but the author's name\nis not very close to the title, at least not on the outside.\nThe same Latin paragraph preceding the preface of\nthis book, and authorising its publication, which contained\nthe name Lepicier, also contained in a conspicuous way\nthe word \" Romae.\" This reminded M. R. H. of a\nvery happy period in 1912 when she and A. V. B.\nstayed for several months in Rome. It was happy in\nspite of the fact that M. R. H. caught Roman fever,\nand was for a time seriously ill and A. V. B. anxious\nabout her. They took a keen interest in the clerical\nside of Roman life during that visit, so that the clerical\nwording of the paragraph is in an appropriate key.\nThis item of the book-test is also therefore successful.\nThere is a good deal that is of interest throughout the\nbook-test of this day, and I shall refer to it again in \u00a7 7.\nThe next to be referred to in the present connexion\nwas also more or less successful all through. It occurred\nin an A. V. B. sitting on August 28, 1918. The shelf\nhaving been clearly indicated and the fifth book from\nleft to right in it specified, Feda goes on :\nOn page what is called one four of this book, fourteen,\nwait a minute, something made her feel, gave her a feeling\nof heat, something hot, heat, about half way do^vn that\n\f1\n282 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nI^age. But she'd better explain, it might come from two\nsources, it might come from a mention of heat, like a hot\nsun, or a hot fire, or it might come from a mention of\ngreat anger, but spoken of as heat ; in fact she'd be\nobliged if you'd tell her which it is next time you come.\nThe book indicated proved to be Larhneadotv, by\nMarmacUike Pickthall, and had not been read or opened\nby the sitters. The pages have thirty-three lines. On\nthe sixteenth line of p. 14 occur the words \" ardent\npatriot,\" which give heat in the metaphorical sense,\nand on the fifteenth line of p. 15, facing p. 14, occurs\nthe word \" bonfire,\"\" which gives heat in the literal\nsense. When the book is closed the words \" ardent\n\"\nand \" bonfire \" almost touch each other. There is a\ncertain interest in this in view of the alleged liability\nto confusion between two pages facing each other. It\nmay be added that a good deal of angry feeling con-\nnected with the bonfire is referred to in the chapter\nin which pp. 14 and 15 occur.\nThe imperfect knowledge claimed by the communi-\ncators of passages referred to in book-tests\u2014and the\nkind of imperfection\u2014are well illustrated by this case.\nSometimes it is claimed that their knowledge is increased\nafter the tests have been verified by the sitters. For\nexample, on October 2, 1918, in a discussion as to\nwhether the beginning or the end of a sitting was the\nmore favourable time for book-tests, Feda says of A. V. B :\nF. She says that now she's so much more in touch with\nyou and Mrs. Twonnie when you're away from here [i.e.\nfrom the medium's house], she is able to know whether\nthe book-tests are good or bad.\nThe next case of exact indication I shall quote is\nrather different in character. It occurred in the A. V. B.\nsitting of October 2, 1918, from which I have just quoted.\nOn this occasion the book-test items were not as a whole\nvery satisfactory. There was nothing that could be\ndescribed in an unqualified manner as a failure, but the\ncorrespondence between the indications given and the\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 283\nwords or passages found were, I should say, in the\ncase of five items either not striking or rather forced ;\nand in a sixth, where the appropriateness of the message\nfound was clear and decided, there was not only an\nambiguity as to which of two rows of books was meant,\nbut also a difficulty in knowing how to count the page.\nThe seventh item is the one I am about to quote.\nAfter speaking of a book whose title suggests submarines\nand the harm they do, which the sitters afterwards\nidentified as The Still Water Tragedy, Feda said :\nP. {s.v. Wait a minute, can't see it ! Some one lying\ndown ?) Feda don't understand what she means,\nbut she keeps on showing Feda a little picture as\nif some one was lying down in it. This picture\nseems to have something very white either round\nit or very close to it, \"cos she shows Feda like a\ngleam of white.\nU. V. T. What is this connected with ?\nF. She says I want you to bear in mind at what\npoint in the sitting I give this \" ?\nU. V. T. Slie gives it after reference to submarines.\nF. She says \" Well, when you get to that point you\nshould see the pictme.\" (Here Feda suddenly\nbends sideways in her chah.) Feda feels they're\nnot lying on their backs. Oh ! she says she must\nremark by the way that a person lying down is\nin no way reminiscent of submarines, but when\nyou find this person lying down, you'll find in a\nvery near vicinity something that, to a great\nextent, is connected with submarines. She says\nshe knows she's correct about this, but that though\nwhat she's giving is correct to the letter, when\nyou finds it it will be different to what you\nexpect. NoAv she says \"Is it clear that I'm\ngiving this picture as likely to be foimd after\nyou've found the book to do with submarines,\nand that after you've found the picture you'll\nagain be reminded of submarines, though the\npicture has nothing whatever to do with sub-\nmarines.\"\n\f284 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nNow about three weeks before this sitting the books\nin that bookcase\u2014the large one in M. R. H.'s study, from\nwhich a good many book-tests had been taken\u2014had\nby M. R. H.'s orders been entirely rearranged by a\nhousemaid, who on one or two of the shelves had put\ntwo rows of books, with the smaller ones at the back,\nand it was in the back row that The Still Water Tragedy\nand a book apparently referred to just before had been\nfound. To get at them for purposes of verification the\nbooks in front of them had to be moved, and among\nthese was a book called The Celebrity at Home, by\nViolet Hunt, which stood exactly in front of The Still\nWater Tragedy. On the side of the cover of this book,\ninvisible as the book stood in the shelf,\nis [to quote the recorders] a picture representing an\ninterior. In the foreground is a little girl lying stretched\nout sideways in a large low arm-chair with her cheek\nupon her hand, and the angle at which the child is\nreclining is such that she must be said to be lying down.\nThis picture is coloured, and in it are two very striking\nsplashes of white. The child to begin with is dressed\nentirely in white, and her head is surrounded by the white\nupholstery of the back of the chair ; then at the back,\nbut to the left of the child, is another large splash of\nwhite, representing the window in the room. [White, they\ncontinue,] is by far the most consj)icuous and striking\n[element in the colouring.]\nIf we suppose that the communicator knew that the\nbook with the picture on it would have to be moved\nto find the book she connected with submarines, she\nwould be right in thinldng that \"this picture is hkely\nto be found after youVe found the book to do with\nsubmarines.\" In the further statements \" that after\nyou've found the picture you'll again be reminded of\nsubmarines,\" and that what would remind them would\nbe something in the very near vicinity of the picture,\nit seems probable that the second book from The Celebrity\nat Home in the same row was referred to. This book\nwas A Poor Mans House, by Stephen Reynolds. The\n\fLXXXI.j An Examination of Book-Tests. 285\nwhole book deals with the sea and the life of fishermen,\nand it had been a favourite of A. V. B\/s, who had\nread it aloud to M. R. H.\nThis incident of the picture is interesting, because,\nthough the description is less detailed, it is of the same\nnature as that of the \" Canape Bleu \" painting given\non September 12, 1917 (quoted above, p. 249), and\nthat of the little statuette of Adeline Genee, which\nfollowed at the sitting under discussion (see Appendix B).\nBut it differs in the very important particular, that\nwhereas the knowledge shown of the painting and the\nstatuette may have been derived by telepathy from\nthe sitters, aided perhaps by the memory of the\ncommunicator, neither of these sources seem likely to\nhave been available in the same way in the present\ncase. For, as already said, the picture was not visible\nas the book stood on the shelf ; and even if M. R. H.\nand U. V. T. had any subconscious memory of the\npicture on the book at all, they were not con-\nscious of the presence of the book in the shelves. It\nis true that M. R. H. had read the book long ago, and\nmust then have known of the picture on the cover,\nbut U. V. T. had never read it, and both are confident\nthat they had not seen it in referring to books in the\nbookcase. There is no particular reason to suppose\nthat A, V. B. had read it, though she may have done so.\nThe perception of this picture may therefore have\nbeen of the same nature as that of insides of books,\nand it is for that reason that I have classed it with\nbook-tests here. At the same time it was not inside\na book, and therefore was more likely to have been noticed\nthan a \" message \" in a book-test proper. For instance,\nthe housemaid who re-arranged the books may have\nobserved it particularly. Moreover, we have no case\nof the inside of a book being visualised by Feda (as\ndistinct from the communicator) in the way this picture\nwas. For a discussion of this point see below p. 370.\nIt is of some interest that, immediately after the\nbook-tests of this day, Feda went on to describe with\nconsiderable accuracy various things in the room. Part\n\f286 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\nof what she said, and in particular the description of the\nstatuette of Adehne Genee referred to above is quoted in\nAppendix B, p. 386. Peda was apparently in a visualising\nvein that day.\nI will conclude this set of cases, where the corre-\nspondence between Feda's statement and the passage\nindicated is verbally defiziite, with a quotation from an\nA. W. V. sitting on January 4, 1919. U. V. T. was\nrecording for the sitter, Mrs. Salter.\nF. ... books where you {i.e. Mrs. Salter] live, wait a\nminute, window\u2014window\u2014near window\u2014side\u2014side\u2014You\nnever can show me books plainly there ! Feda means\nwhere you Uve ; he never can ; I get at it only by\nworrying him, but he keeps on saying \"Books near a\nwindow.\" [Mrs. Salter was living at the time at The-\nCrown House, Newport, Essex. There is only one shelf of\nbooks there near a Avindow. These were standing in a\nsingle row on the same wall as the window, immediately\nto the right of it, in a small unused bed-room. They had\nbeen placed there some weeks earlier by Mr. Salter with a\nview to book-tests. Some of them were new books bought\nby him in London and placed in the shelf without Mrs.\nSalter seeing them, and some of them were taken from\nother shelves in the house. Mrs. Salter loiew nothing of\nthe order in which these books were placed, and did not\nenter the room in which they were until she went there\nto verify this test. Information about these books cannot\ntherefore have been derived entirely from her mind.]\nF. ... About the middle of this shelf, as he stepped back\nand looked at it something made a contrasting\u2014What did\nyou say ? A contrasting note just about the middle. . .\nWhat he gives me the idea of is that the contrasting note\nis colour, and rather striking. [Mrs. Salter comments :\nThere are several rather marked contrasts in the colour of\nthese books ; about the middle of the shelf a book in a\nbright yellow paper cover was standing next to a green\nbook.] Go to the left of that shelf, the second book from\nthe left. What did you say ? An\u2014what ? While he was\n\fLxxxi.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 287\nfeeling for this book he got an idea of Wedgewood, china,\nWedgewood; he's not sure if it was from the book or\nvery close to it, but as he wented to feel that second\nbook the words Wedgewood china seemed to\u2014he laughs,\nand says they seemed to smite him. He says it sometimes\nseems when you get em well, they seems to do that ;\n(Feda smites her hands together). [The only interpretation\nMrs. Salter can suggest of this is that the three books on\nthe left, including the test book, are bound in shghtly\nvarying shades of light blue, resembling Wedgewood china\nblue, with patterns stamped on them in black.]\nWe may take it then, that the book meant and its\nplace is sufficiently well indicated. The first test given\nis somewhat spoilt by a muddle about the page. Feda\nfirst says 25, and corrects this to 35, saying the 3 was\nbadly made by the communicator. There was nothing\nappropriate on p. 35, but on p. 25 there was a more\nor less appropriate sentence. It would not, however,\nhave been a good specimen of the kind of exact corre-\nspondence wdth which we are dealing at the present\nmoment. Feda then continues :\nF.

But there's some-\nthing at the top what takes off the straightness\u2014er\n\u2014\nMr. Arthur says that's very important. While he's '\ntelling me that, I get a funny feeling as if the funny .\npole means something very important.\nThe book designated proved to be Daisy Miller, by\nHenry James. In the middle of p. 15 is the following j\npassage :\n'i\n\" I should like to know where you got that pole,\" she \\\nsaid. i\n' I bought it !\n\" responded Randoljih. ,\nThis passage, Mrs. Salter found, begins almost exactly i\na quarter of an inch above the middle of the page, :\na line drawn at the middle running along the bottom (\nof the word \"pole.\" This pole is described on p. 14 I\nas an alpenstock, and on p. 12 as a long alpenstock, so ;\nthere is no doubt as to its length ; but there is nothing j\nto suggest that it is anything but straight all the way up. j\nIt has been suggested to me, however, that fancy alpen- ^\nstocks, such as tourists buy, often have a chamois horn i\nfixed at the top, and that it would be quite natural to j\nimagine Randolph's to be of this type.\n^\n.-\n!\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 289\nAs regards cross-correspondences, I am not aware that\nany connected with pole \" has occurred. It is, however,\nnoteworthy that Mrs. Stuart Wilson who, as readers of\nthe S.P.R.

This fact had been recorded before the\nbook-test was given, but has never been published.\nI here conclude instances of book-tests in which the\npassages to be found are described with verbal accuracy ;\nbut it will, I think, be worth the student's while to refer\nto some cases given in the next section, which in some\nways or some degree approximate to the verbal exact-\nness of correspondence between the message as indicated\nand as found which has characterised the cases in the\npresent section.\n\u00a7 5.\nSome Miscellaneous Cases.\nI WILL again follow chronological order, and take as\nthe first case in this section an A. V. B. book-test of\nSeptember 19, 1917. It is interesting, because the\n\" message found in the exact place indicated was quite\nremarkably appropriate, though unfortunately only very\nvaguely described beforehand ; and because through refer-\nence to an ornament which had been possessed by her\nthe communicator seems to show knowledge of the book\nin which the ''\nmessage \" was, though apparently unable\nto give its name directly. The case has some analogy\nwith the A. V. B. book-test of the previous week,\nSeptember 12, 1917, described above (p. 248). I will\nnow quote the record.\nr. She says she does think she's getting on well with\nbook tests.\nM. R. H. Yes she is.\n\f290 Mrs. Henry Sidgivich. [part\nF. She's got another one.

Mrs. Twonnie, she keeps on showing\nFeda as if she had a ribbon hanging down with\na piece of glass on it. It's like a black ribbon.\nShe's put it on herself, you see. . . . It's some-\nthing she wore on the earth plane, and the\nribbon hangs down to about here, to her waist.\nFurther attempts are made to describe something\ndangling on that black ribbon, rounded, but not like a\nball, shiny, light coloured, and not very big, with a\npattern on it, in shape like a pat of butter, etc., etc.,\netc.\nF. Now she thinks you will know that thing, though it's not\nthe thing that is important. The importance is about a\nbook test. She goes back to your books now, to the ones\nnear the window, and she is taking the sixth book from\nthe window. 1 Oh ! and she's showing Feda that the page\nis one hundred and eight. Feda sees that it's on the\nlower part of the page. Ladye says that it's about two\nthirds of the way down as near as she can tell, that there\nis a message that has a bearing on her feeling toward\nyou, but also, in a very peculiar way, perhaps in a way\nthat an uninitiated person would not understand unless it\nwas pointed out to them, the message refers to that thing\non a black ribbon, to the conditions of it. You know\npretty Avell what things she did have hanging and she\nthinks that message will point to which one of them she's\nmeaning.\nThe book proved to be Dickens's The Old Curiosity\nShop, and the sentence beginning exactly two-thirds of\nthe way down p. 108 is \" talked of their meeting in\nanother world as if he were dead but yesterday.\"\nReunion between M.

V. B.\"s feelmg\ntowards M. R. H. The message itself does not refer\nto the thing on a black ribbon, but that thing was\nconnected with an old curiosity shop, and therefore with\nthe book in which the message was. and in a way that\nwoidd not be obvious to the uninitiated. But it must be\nachnitted that the ornament was not clearly identified.\nA. V. B.. it appears, possessed a number of ornaments\nworn upon a ribbon or a chain, and answering more\nor less to the description given by Feda. That descrip-\ntion, which I have given in a much abbreviated form,\nstrikes M. R. H. as being of the nature of a composite\nof several of these ornaments. M. R. H. had herself\npresented several of these to A. V. B., picking them up\nin old curiosity shops. One particular ornament that\ncomes to her mind in connection with Feda\"s descrip-\ntion was a . very fine piece of jade, circular, carved on\nboth sides, and highly pohshed, and very like a circular\nflat pat of butter, as Feda says. This A. V. B. always\nwore upon a ribbon or a piece of black velvet, though\nM. R. H. does not think the ribbon was long enough\nto allow it to come as far as the waist. It was pur-\nchased by M. R. H. at a big Chinese warehouse in the\ncity that deals in valuable Chinese curios, many of them\nold.\nWe could not base a case for clairvoyance on this\nincident alone, but in spite of its defects it seems to\nme very striking. In the first place it is almost certain,\nI think, that some intelligence was aware that the book\nindicated was The Old Curiosity Shop, or why connect\nwith it an object or objects worn by A. V. B. and\nobtained at old curiosity shops ? ^ But the knowledge\nimpUed could only have been acquired svipernormally.\nM. R. H. was at this time still anonymous to Mrs.\nLeonard, who had moreover never seen her flat. Most\nlikely M. R. H. could not have consciously described\nthe exact position in a large bookcase of the book ;\n1 It should perhaps be stated that the words The Old Curiosity\nShop \" appear as the headline of the page containing the message.\n\f292 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nbut even if consciously or subconsciously she knew it,\nFeda could only have obtained it from her mind by tele-\npathy\u2014that is, by a supernormal method. And in this\nconnexion it is interesting to note that M. R. H. at\nfirst failed to observe the relation between the ornament\nand the book, probably because Feda made the mistake\nof connecting it with the \" message \" in the book. It\nwas only after the connexion had been suggested by I\nMr. Piddington that M. R. H. perceived it.\nThen again the extreme appropriateness of the\n\" message \" found in the exact position on the page\ngiven\u2014an appropriateness to M. R. H.'s feelings and\nattitude of mind and also to the general tenor of the\nA. V. B. communications\u2014seems beyond chance,^ though\nthe description beforehand of the nature of the message\nto be found was so slight and vague. Altogether we\nhave what looks like real knowledge of the book and its\ncontents, and a real memory, though perhaps a confused\none, of the ornaments worn by A. V. B. It is perhaps\ninstructive that all this was apparently combined \u2022\nwith\na want of power somewhere to get the information\nclearly out.\nIn the following book-test, given in an A. V.

Yes, but it sort of knits two or three of the other\nmessages together. That is to say, and this is\nawfully important,\u2014oh ! wait a moment, she\nwants to get a word to explain her meaning, it\nhas a bearing on the other messages in a way\nthat might be that of an unprejudiced onlooker\ngiving an opinion on the other messages, almost\nlike a little summary. She says you will find it\nwill have that meaning if you take it quite\nliterally.

It looks like a dull book to Feda,\n\fi\n294 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [PAET\nwith the pages closely written all over, no nice\nlittle paragraphs and things. The book looks like\na dull dark colour, but she shows Feda that in\nthe vicinity there is a book with a bluey green\ncover. There is a word rather like Sim, Sim\nsomething, wTitten on a book that is quite close\nto the other one.\nThe book was found to be Vol. III. of The Boyal\nNavy, a History, by Sir William Laird Clowes and others\n(Sampson, Low, Marston & Co., 1898). It was bound\nin a dark, dull-blue colour, and below the title upon\nits back was an octagonal design in gilt, something\nbetween a circle and a star in shape, about the size\nof a sixpence, and rather conspicuous. This design\nappears also upon its companion volumes, but upon no\nother book in the bookcase. A bluey green, or greeny\nblue, volume was found upon the same shelf, but the\nword Sim or any word beginning with that syllable\ncould not be discovered on any book in the case.^ As\nto the inside\u2014pp. 126 and 127 which faced each other\nwere uncut. On p. 127 nothing appeared answering to\nthe description. But the middle part of p. 126 was\noccupied by a paragraph in smaller type than the rest.\nThis is a cj^uotation from Captain Mahan summarising\nthe tactical lessons afforded by the two naval encounters\nbetween English and French squadrons in the year 1747.\nA date (viz. 1747) and a foreign word (viz. \" melee,\"\nwhich is printed in italics) occur in the course of it.\nMoreover, the quotation may well be called \" a little\nsummary,\" though the word is not used. But by no\neffort of the imagination can we regard the passage as a\nsummary of previous \" messages \" or as connected with\nthese.\nIn the A. V. B. sitting of October 10, 1917, we have\nmessages in two books defined by their relation to each\nother. The shelf intended having been clearly defined,\nFeda said :\n1 Can \" Sir,\" the title of the author, have been the syllable meant ?\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 295\nShe wants to say at once that it's the 12th book [left\nto right], and the 28th page . . . the message is in there\nbut the fourteenth book on the 11th page has got also a\nmessage which refers to the same subject.\nLadye says that in the first book that she mentioned, that\nis the 12th book on the shelf, it's lower do^vn the page than\nin the second book she spoke of which is the 14th on the\nshelf. Wait a minute, Ladye saj='s that the message in one\ncontradicts the message in the other a little. She says she\nis only mentioning that as part of the test.\nThe books proved to be Vols. II. and III. respectively\nof Naval Tracts of Sir William Monson, issued by the\nNavy Records Society ; and the sentences on the pages\nnamed which seemed most appropriate as messages\nwere, in the first named volume, the third and fourth\nline from the bottom of the p)age :\n\" No man can receive blame thereby ; all is to be\nattributed to the want of experience ...\"\nIn the second book, ninth to twelfth lines from the\nbottom of the page :\nWe are young and able, and he that will not beUeve us\nmay try us. . . . We shall be better than those that went\nbefore us.\nThe sitters suggest that these \" messages \" may apply\nfirst to their want of experience, and secondly to their\nzeal and energy in Psychical Research. However this\nmay be, the relative positions of the messages on the\npages is correctly specified, and they do a little con-\ntradict each other, since the first blames want of experi-\nence for failure, and the second exalts youth and vigour,\nconditions where experience is likely to be defective.\nIn both these books the pages were uncut.\nThe pages were also uncut in a book-test given by\nA.

R.

Feda don't think it's a sitting room. Not a proper table,\nthe top of a piece of furniture. In a bedroom, yes, a\nbedroom, not close to a door, across the room. This is not\na proper test. He got it in case it wasn't moved. He\nthought he'd see what he could get out of it. Some\npart of the book must have lines of poetry. He's\nshowing two little lines, not across the pages.

[part\nthe top a message from your lady, suggests places and\nconditions of places that you would know she would like\nto be in. Suggests beautiful places she'd like to be in.\nIt suggests a description of places she is in now. There's\nsomething just before the message that disqualifies this,\nspoils it. If you were to read the first part, it would be\nwrong altogether for what she wants to convey. The\nactual message cannot be mistaken. It suggests beautiful\nplaces like what she's in now. You'd say :\n\" I know\nshe'd like that.\"' But what conies before would dis-\nqualify it. That's all for that book.\n[Mrs. Salter writes about this :]\nThere are only two bedrooms at [the house in question]\nwhich have any books in them (I did not examine the\nservants' bedrooms), my own and a spare room. In\nmy room there were no books lying on top of a piece\nof furnitui'e. . . In the spare room, which contains no\nbookcase, seven books had been placed horizontally on\nthe top of a small wardrobe at the opposite corner of\nthe room from the door. On the evening of April 11,\n1918, I found these books lying in three piles, two and\ntwo and three. It was not accurate therefore to speak\nas Feda does of a single book. So far as the position of\nthe books goes the test might apply equally well to any\nof the seven. But fortunately a further hint is given\nwhich seems to identify the book. Feda says that\n\" part of the book must have lines of poetry ; he's\nshowing two little lines not across the pages.\" Of the\nseven books in question six are in prose ; the seventh\nis a volume of Tennyson printed in double columns, so\nthat the allusion to\n'\n' little lines\n'\n' is particularly apt.\nPage 31 is almost entirely occupied by the poem entitled\n\" Mariana in the South.\". . . In the upper part of the\nleft-hand column [appear the lines] :\nNor bird would sing, nor lamb would bleat.\nNor any cloud would cross the vault\nBut day increased from heat to heat,\nOn stony drought and steaming salt,\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 299\nTill now at noon she slept again,\nAnd seemed knee-deep in mountain grass,\nAnd heard her native breezes pass,\nAnd runlets babbling down the glen.\n[Mrs. Salter continues :] I take it that reference is in-\ntended to [the last four of these] lines. My mother was\nalways exceedingly fond of mountain scenery and air ;\nshe and my father visited Switzerland or the Italian\nAlps almost every summer for many years, and if visits\nto the mountains are possible \" on the other side \" they\nwould certainly be something my mother would greatly\nenjoy. The lines begin almost exactly one-third of the\nway down the page. It is not therefore quite exact to\nsay that they are \" near the top of the page,\" but they\nare entirely in the upper half. The rest of the poem, in\ncontrast to these lines, describes the jilace in which\nMariana actually is, \u2014bare, hot and dusty. This seems\nto give a special point to the statement that \" there's\nsomething just before the message that spoils it,\" etc.\nThe other items of the book-tests of this day are not\nstrikingly good or bad, but they contain tw^o indications\nof possible connexion with work published by the S.P.R.,\nas I have pointed out below, pp. 325, 333.\nOn reading in proof this account of the book-test of\nApril 11, 1918, Mr. Piddington was reminded of some\nnotes Mrs. Verrall had sent to him during her last illness,\nwhen she knew^ she was dying. ^ He looked these up, and\nfound the following dated May 20 [1916] and posted May 31 :\nDon't look for communications \" for some time. If\nI have any choice, I shall have a long and dreamless\nsleep followed by a very long holiday with A. W. V. in\nwhatever over there is most like the upper valleys of the\nItalian Alps.\nThe correspondence of this note (which the sitter, Mrs.\nSalter, had not seen) with the \" message ''\nand the passage\nin \" Mariana in the South \" seems remarkable, and is\n1 Mrs. Verrall died on July 2, 1916. There are other notes written\nwhen she was dying which testify to her love of Alpine scenery and\nAlpine flowers.\n\f300 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nstrengthened by the fact that in any book-test supposed,\nto be given by Mrs. Verrall her husband has been in-\nvariably associated with her, and I am told this is so in\nother communications through Mrs. Leonard attributed to\nMrs. Verrall.\n\u00a7 6.\n\u2022\nSpecial Experiments.\nIn the course of their sittings with Mrs. Leonard,.\nM. R. H. and U. V. T. tried different experiments in\nbook-tests with a view especially to testing the possibility,\nor impossibility of the knowledge shown being obtained\nthrough telepathy from themselves.\nThus in November and December, 1917, a few books\nwere taken by U. V. T. blindfolded from one bookcase\nand locked up in another. The books could not be seen\nin their new position, and no one knew what books\nhad been placed there. The experiment had been ex-\nplained to Feda, and at three sittings attempts to give\nbook-tests from these particular books were made. The\nresult was not brilliant, and showed nothing conspicuously\nand undeniably right, but it did not markedly differ\nfrom the average.\nOn another occasion\u2014July 17, 1918\u2014an attempt was\nmade to get A. V. B. to describe a book deliberately\nselected by U. V. T. The experiment was almost the\nconverse of the last. Feda was told on July 11 that\nthe book would be taken from the neighbourhood of one\nselected by A. V. B. for a previous book-test, and would\nbe placed in a specified shelf. The book chosen was a\nFrench one called Amitie Amoureuse, and consisted of a\nseries of letters exchanged between a man and a woman.\nIt had been a favourite of A. V. B.'s, but had not been\nread by M. R. H. U. V. T. had read it rather recently.\nFeda failed to give its number in the shelf, but ultimately\ngot an unmistakable approximation to the title,^ and\n1 At first she got no nearer than \" it sounds a bit like Asia\u2014Asieu.\"\nLater on, however, she spelt it out as A.M.U.R.E.U.S.E. and then\n\u2014\nusing the continental pronunciation said \" Amici, Amois\u2014no not that\nAmit\u2014 . . . Amiei, Amise, Amieie.\"\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 301\nseveral correct and partially correct impressions about the\ninside, though these were fragmentary and not very\nstriking.\nA row of Italian books was tried in March and April,\n1918. Feda was told that the message should be chosen\nfrom books in a certain place, but not that these were\nin a foreign language. U. V. T. is well acquainted with\nItalian, and A. V. B. also knew it, as did two other\ncommunicators\u2014Dr. Verrall and one \" E. A.\"\u2014who also,\naccording to Feda, selected or assisted in selecting book-\ntests from this row for their respective sitters. The\nfive sittings concerned with these Italian books joroduced\nthe average amount of success in book-tests. One of\nthem\u2014an A. W. V. sitting on April 23, 1918\u2014which\nwas rather unusually successful, was additionally inter-\nesting because at the time the sitter, Mrs. Salter, had\nnever been at M. R. H.'s flat, and did not know any-\nthing about the books in the row in question. Any\ndirect influence from the sitter's knowledge is therefore\nhere excluded. An item of this book-test has been\ngiven above, p. 277.\nBut the most important experiment was with Greek\nbooks\u2014Greek being a language unknown to M. R. H.\nor U. V. T., or to Mrs. Leonard, or the supposed com-\nmunicator, A. V. B. The experiment was suggested by\nthe latter on September 18, 1918, as follows :\nF. She [i.e. A. V. B.] says she's perfectly aware now that it\nisn't the actual word she gets, but the idea of it.'^ She\nsays \"... I'm sure it Avould not matter if the words\nwere written in Japanese. I think I could sense them.\"\nShe says \" do you know that unless I were to find out\njust by accident that there was something different about\nthe books, if all the books in your room in London were\nwritten in a language I'd never seen or heard, I probably\nshould not kiaow the difference.\". . . She'd like to try\nthe experiment Mrs. Twonnie. She says if you could get\nhold of two or three books of any kind written in a\nIt is interesting that this was said just after A. V. B. had been\nreferring to a word beginning with V. like Vodka. See below, pp. 339\nand 356.\n\f302 Mrs. Henry Sidgwicl-. [part\nlanguage you could prove she didn't know, and that you\nwere sure the medium didn't know, and that you and\nMrs. Una would not know, it would be good. That's what\nshe wants ;\nyou won't know whether she's right or wrong\ntill you get it interpreted. She saj^s if only she's as\nsuccessful in that as she has been in many of her book-\ntests, peoples wouldn't know how to explain it, would\nthey ? . . . She says you might borrow the books from\nsome Society or Library\u2014she means she w^ould like books\nif possible that somebody's read.\nIt was decided to use Greek books for this experiment,\nand in the first instance to borrow some from Mrs. Salter.\nThe experiment was first tried on October 30, 1918.\nBut it should be noted that when M. R. H. told A. V. B.\non October 26, that she would put the books in j)osi-\ntion the next day, A. V. B. made a remark which indi-\ncates at least a suspicion that Greek would be the\nlanguage used\u2014a very natural guess. Feda represented\nher as saying :\nF. She says \" I must say something about them [the\nbooks] now. I feel that there are two ways of\ngiving that language . . . there are two different\nways of expressing oneself in that language, so\ndifferent that unless one had learnt both ways\nthe one would seem like a foreign language to the\nother.\"\nM. R. H. Quite right.\nF. She only wanted to say that so that you should\nknow she had an inkling ; that she knew what\nyou were doing.\nThis looks like a reference to the difference between\nmodern and classical Greek\u2014and assuming A. V. B. to\nknow or to have guessed that the books were in Greek\nand presumably concerned with ancient Greece, we have\nto consider how far the things said about them at the\nseven sittings during which the experiment was carried on\nwere beyond what might naturally be inferred or guessed.\nRather unfortunately she said so many things about these\n\fLXXXI.] A71 Examination of Book-Tests. 303\nbooks ^ that one feels the HkeHhood of successful chance\nshots is considerable.\nI will give all the items of the tests of October 30,\n1918, with the corresponding verification or the reverse\nafter each.\nI. \" Starting at the left, the seqond book.

She keeps on inter-\nrupting herself and she's talking about the third\nbook, and giving something from it which might\nalso be got from the other books, she thinks it\nvery likely would. . . . She got head dresses, an\nidea of head dresses, head dresses of some peculiar\nkind, and also some rather extraordinary manner\nof dressing the hair, or not dressing it she says.\n[As will be noticed no page is named here. If we may\nassume that the last page mentioned, namely p. 4, is\nmeant, this item is remarkably good, for on that page we\nget in the following passage both a pecuUar head-dress and\nthe idea of imitation (by the lonians). Speaking of the\nAthenians Thucydides says :\n\" The leading men in the\nwealthy class through this soft manner of life until quite\nrecently wore linen tunics and tied up their hair in a\ntop-knot fastened with a golden grasshopper. From which\nit came about that the leading men of Ionia, for kinship's\nsake, largely adopted the same style.\"]\nXI. Feda proceeds :\n\" a feeling of embroidery.\"\n[There is no mention of embroidery on page 4 or on the\nneighbouring pages, but the above allusions to luxury and\nsplendour in dress suggest it.]\nXII.

Yes. :\n\"\n'\n'\nF. Well, at the very bottom of the next page\n'\n\u2022\nbackwards, going towards the beginning of the\ni' ,\n'\nbook, right at the bottom of that page, there's\n:' ' just a word\u2014she says: \"I think it's only one\nword, it may be two, but I think it's only one\n,. word\" that she so strongly wishes you, she says\nyou'll know she particularly wishes it just now,\n'..'I :\n'\njust lately. That's all about those books.\n[The last leaf of the volume is a blank fly-leaf. The\nnext leaf to this, backwards, has only thirteen lines of\nI-\nprint on it and these on one side only, the other side\n1 {\nbeing blank.

Thus stated\nnumerically the success was far above the average ; but\nhow far individual successes are to be regarded as beyond\nthe probability of guesswork is another question.\nAs the books used were Mrs. Salter's, and Mrs. Salter\nhad before this date had a good many sittings with\nMrs. Leonard and acted as note-taker at others, the\nquestion of telepathy from her is worth considering. It\nappears, however that she had never regularly used\nthe copies of Thucydides and Demosthenes in question.\nShe may have occasionally used them to refer to, but\nin reading those authors she had used other annotated\neditions.\nThis was by far the most successful effort made by\nA. V. B. in connection with the Greek books. It would\nbe tedious to go through all the seven sittings at which\nthe experiment was tried, and I will therefore only\nmention important points in the remaining ones. The\nsittings took place on November 13 and December 8,\n\f310 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\n18 and 28, 1918, and on January 1 and 15, 1919. Of\nthese the first two need not detain ns. But on December\n18 there was a success of some interest. Eight successive\nitems were complete failures, and then Feda said that\non p. 5 of the third book from the left, about half\nway down there was\nF. rather a good description of a place that Ladye's\nfond of. . . . She says \" And I want to qualify\nwhat I said about being fond of it, and to say\ninterested in it, you will know that I was indeed\ninterested in this place, but fond of it is not\nquite the right word.\" She says you [i.e.\nM. R. H., U. V. T. was not present on this\noccasion] have something in your possession con-\nnected with the place, Mrs. Twonnie, she's pre-\ntending to fold something. (Here Feda makes a\ngesture of folding something with her hands, her\ngesture would be applicable to folding a piece of\npaper, to making a fold in material, or to folding\nsuch a thing as a folding photograph frame.)\nWait a minute, you mean Mrs. Twonnie has this\nthing now ? Yes, you's got the thing that's con-\nnected with the place. It's only a small thing.^\n\u2014\nStamp, Stamp.

Beginning to count the pages with the\nargument prefixed to the play, we find about haK way\ndown the fifth page \" the wintry land of Thrace.\" Taking\nthe ancient Thrace as equivalent to a considerable part\nof the modern Balkans, A. V. B. was interested in it\nin the latter part of her life as the region in which\nAdmiral Troubridge was worldng on the staff of the\nCrown Prince of Serbia, and M. R. H. had received\nletters from him from there.\nOn January 1, 1919, again occurred two successful\nitems of some interest :\nF. She says . . . she wouldn't care to be described in appear-\nance quite as some one is in this book. There is some\none described in appearance\u2014or at any rate an indication\ngiven of their appearance. . . . It's just an inchcation,\nbut one which would be quite clear and definite. She\nsays now that this description what she would not like\nappUed to her is in the vicinity of [the last item]. She\ncan't tell you whether it's on the same page or not but\nit's very close. [The page referred to was p. 9 of the\n2nd book from the right.]\n[The volume proved to be the Iliad of Homer, Books\nXIII. -XXIV. The pages were unnumbered and some\npages at the beginning had been torn out.^ To arrive at\npage 9 the pages Avere counted.

V. B.'s remark.]\n^ This had been done to prevent any one suggesting that a person\nwho did not know Greek might have inferred from a translation on\nwhat page of the original would occur the equivalent of something\nselected in the translation. This possible flaw in the conditions of\ntheir experiment having struck M. R. H. and U. V. T., they discarded\nafter December 18 the books borrowed from Mrs. Salter and substituted\neleven second-hand volumes out of which they tore and destroyed an\nuncertain number of pages at the beginning and end\u2014afterwards keeping\nthe -I'olumes in a locked book-case. This mutilation of the books was\nnot commented on by A. V. B.\n\f312 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\n[Feda goes on to page 66 of the same book and after\na partially correct statement about two buildings being\nmentioned on it, says] \"Just at the bottom of the\nsame page there's a word suggests dancing to her . .\nShe only throws that in she says.\"\n[On the fourth line from the bottom of the page\ncounted as 66, occurs the name \" Meriones \" in connexion\nwith J]]neas throwing a spear at him. Meriones jumped\naside, and near the top of page 67 (facing page 66) is\nthe taunting remark of JSneas referring to this :\n\u2014\n\" Meriones, swiftly should my spear have stopped thy\ndancing for ever, good dancer as thou art, if I had but\nstruck thee.\" If Meriones is the word, the perception of\nthat name at the bottom of one ]3age and of the associa-\ntion of dancing with it on the next appear here to be\ncombined.]\nAfter one or two more items the sitters were referred\nto the third book in the row, which proved to be Thucy-\ndides, V.-VIII. About this book no less than eight\nstatements were made referring to five different pages,\nand some of them apparently very definite. But not a\nsingle point was correct. Either the whole thing was\nimagination or invention, or the position of the volume\nmeant was incorrectly given, or Feda had got the paging\nwrong. The book, though bought at second-hand, was\nuncut, and did not therefore fulfil A. V. B.'s desire that\nit should have been read by some one. But though\nwe can imagine that its unread condition might prevent\nA. V. B. \" sensing (as she called it) the contents, it\nis vejy difficult to suppose it would make her \" sense\n\"\nthem definitely and wrong. Moreover, no hint was given\nthat A. V. B. perceived the book had not been read.\nOn one or two occasions things have been rather success-\nfully said about pages which proved to be uncut. ^ And\nit is of course no new thing for definite statements to\nbe made which proved untrue about pages that had\nbeen read. That has constantly happened throughout\nthe book-tests. It is very doubtful therefore whether\n^ See above, pp. 294, 295.\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Bool-Tests. 313\nany value can be attached to the view attributed to\nA. V. B. and other communicators, that it is important\nthat the pages which they attempt to sense should have\nbeen read.\nThe book-tests of January 15, 1919, were the last\ntaken from the Greek books, and they were not very\nsuccessful. M. R. H., at the end of the sitting, sug-\ngested that the experiment should be discontinued for\na time, and A. V. B., who was controlling, replied :\nA. V. B. I'm not sure we'll have to do any more, it was only\nnecessary to prove that language made no differ-\nence to me. It's the thought that matters ; that's\nhow I get your thoughts so clearly, never mind\nwhat language you spoke in or thought in.\nEstimating the success obtained in the experiments\nwith these Greek books purely numerically, it seems to\nbe about the same as that of the book-tests in the aggre-\ngate, and slightly greater than that of the A. V. B.\ntests as a whole. Moreover, some of those I have quoted\nseem to me striking, though perhaps none are of the\nvery first quality.\nQuestion of Cross-Correspondence.\nIn the book-tests of January 4, 1919, quoted and dis-\ncussed above pp. 286-289, we found the communicator\ntalking of cross-correspondences, and a connexion was\npointed out which may have been more than accidental\nbetween the book-tests on that clay and the automatism\nof Mrs. Stuart Wilson. A good deal was said at different\ntimes in the course of the book-tests before us about\nintended cross-correspondences, and some investigation\nseems called for into the question what evidence there\nactually is for any connexion between these book-tests and\nother automatisms, or other circumstances connected with\npsychical research, which are known to us. Unfortunately\nthe evidence is not very decisive, and helps us less than\n\fMrs. Heyiry Sidgwick. [part\nI could have wished in forming a judgment on book- |\ntests, while at the same time it is difficult to do justice I\nto it without going into considerable detail. I mention J\nthis as I think some readers may jjrefer to omit this !i\nsection.\nThere are various statements as to plan and system\nin series of book-tests. For instance, after the first\nbook-test given to M. R. H. by A. V. B. on July 18\n1917, Feda said ;\nIf this one comes right, which she thmks it ought to,\nshe will want to do some more, so that when they are\ncollected and jmt together all of them should read like a\nlittle letter from her to you, containing advice and counsel.\n. . . She says \" If I can get two or three so that number\ntwo follows pretty well on number one, and number three\nfoUows on number two, it will be interesting.\"\nSimilarly, after the second book-test received by the\nE,ev. C. Drayton Thomas, on September 6, 1917, he\nreports Feda as saying :\nThat these tests would be so arranged as to form a\nsequence. When concluded they would reveal a con-\nsecutive progression of thought and thus make it im-\npossible for people to say that they were the result of\ncoincidence. Mr. Myers was planning them, and they were\ncarried out by a sort of co-operation between him and my\n[Mr. Drayton Thomas's] .father.\nAgain, on November 17, 1917, at an A. V. B. sitting,\nFeda remarks :\n\" Ladye says it's very important to keep tests that seem\nwrong, not only your own tests, because they may fit in\nlike a puzzle and she thinks the failures may be the most\nimportant of all when fitted together.\"\nI have failed to trace any evidence that these plans\nwere successfully carried out. Later come statements\nabout intended cross-correspondences. Thus, on November\n21, 1917, in the course of an A. V. B. sitting, A. V. B.\nsaid during a personal control :\n\u2014\nA. V. B.

Yes, I have, they will know presently, they can't\nknow all at once, they may not find it out all at\nonce, but I am going to try to do cross-corre-\nspondences.^\nU. V. T. What ?\nA. V. B. Yes I am and I shall do it.\n\u2022\nM. R. H. and U. V. T. remark on this that \" At\nany rate as soon as Mrs. Salter became a Leonard sitter,\nland began to receive book-tests [i.e. on November 15,\n!\n1917] they began to look as though intended by the\ncommunicator, A. W. V., to have some connexion with\nscript.\"\nA month later, December 22, 1917, at a sitting of\nMrs. Beadon's, Feda is reported as saying :\nYou know he [the communicator] told you at first about\na series of book tests. In each one there is something that\ntacks on to the last one, in the principal message of the\ntests ! The other bits of the test are just to show you\nthat you have got it.\nAre you alive to the fact that there may be a curious\nkind of cross-correspondence going on. Something you get\nand don't quite understand may fit in to something some\none else is getting. So in the end you will get a personal\nmessage for yourself in which you can read his mind,\nbut also something for other people. It will fit together\nMke in sections.\nFive days later, December 27, 1917, a sort of ampli-\nfication of this was given at an A. V. B. sitting. Feda\nsays :\nF. She says that Avhat's coming through now in these\nbook-tests is nothing like as interesting as it wil}\n1 In June, 1917, M. R. H. had arranged the experiment in cross-\n\u2022eorrespondence described below, p 330. Nothing came of this, and\n1 do not know whether the word cross-correspondence had been used\nin connexion with it. But in any case it is, of course, quite likely\nthat the word may have been used by some one in the presence of\nMrs. Leonard, in or out of trance, so that no importance attaches to\nits use by the trance-personalities.\n\f1\n316 Mrs. Hennj SidgivicJc. [part\nbe when all the words are i)ut together and\nyou lind the Cross. {S.v. You mean cross-i\ncorrespondence Ladye ?) She says to Feda \" You:\nsay what I say, say the Cross.\" Ladye says she\nthinks that she herself and many of the chief\nmovers in these book-tests will be able to tell you\nwhen they are complete. She says, make the j\nCross this way. (Feda draws the Cross in the\nshajie of an X in the air.)\nU. V. T. That's a St. Peter's Cross. ' '\nShe says put it that way. Now, she says, that\nsome things she says to Feda this way that you\ndon't understand, will have a more important\nmeaning for the future than you think. She says\nyou will understand about the Cross ; she says\nthat's how it will be ; she says put it down and\ndraw it. She says something's being worked out,\nand that all evidential tests are only leading up\nto a climax. . . . She says it's very important.\nIt is probable, I think, that the cross described in\nthis passage is a fanciful interpretation by Feda, em-\nbroidered on a misunderstanding of the topic of cross-\ncorrespondences. However this may be, this topic is\ndwelt on at other sittings about this period. It is\nnoteworthy that in November and early December, 1917,\narrangements for working for the Society for Psychical\nResearch were being discussed with Mrs. Leonard, and an\nagreement was entered into with her to work for the\nSociety for three months beginning January 14, 1918.\nOn January 16, 1918, Feda says for A. V. B :\nBe very careful and put a big mark beside what she\nis going to say now and put down the time exactly.\nShe says : \"I can't feel ivhat they're doing, but I feel as\nif some one is trying to get through something to me\n{s.v., something to do with a ladder\u2014a ladder).\" She\nsays you are to put down every syllable as she says\nit {s.v.

Then Feda goes on :\nThe sitters ought to pay particular attention to any\nname or initial that is given through at certain points of\ntheir sittings. She thinks it's more than likely that a\ncross-correspondence may be arranged in a pecuhar way\nthat she's been told to explain . . . they may make use\nof certain messages, or matter which is quite appropriate to\nthe sitters, or as messages to be transferred to the sitters.\nShe says \" we may make use of these in a double sense ;\nwe shall sometimes give a letter, a second letter which\nwill give the ke5Tiote after, if possible we shall choose a\nletter which is connected with the sitter's conditions, so as\nnot to make what would appear to be a muddle ;\nbut we\nshall try to inter-weave a cross-correspondence in that\nwaj.\"\nLadye says that she thinks that it won't be the sittings\nthat will be interesting, it will be what will come out of\nthem, the chain. And the points of people's book-tests,\nand she says don't forget, the wrong book-tests are not to\nbe discarded but placed together.\nLadye says \" it strikes me we are working for the\nSociety to-day, but it's so much better you should know\nwhat they are trying to do, so as if they succeed you\nwon't be in the dark.\" .\nSo far as we know this elaborate plan did not come\noff at all, though, as I shall show, there are indications of\n\f1\n'^IS Mrs. Henry Sidgivich. [part\nattempts at cross-correspondence. Before describing these,\nhowever, I will turn to the A. W. V. book-tests, in which\nwe find what looks like an attempt at connexion with\nother S.P.R. work. The first two A. W. V. book-tests\nwere given on November 15, 1917, and January 14, 1918,\nrespectively, the latter at the first sitting given under\nthe auspices of the Society for Psychical Research. In\nthe first the book indicated ^ proved to be Dr. Verrall's\nown copy of Jebb^s edition of the Antigone of Sophocles.\nFeda said :\nHe's going to give two tests together. On the 8th page\nthere's a reference to a place you'll recognise, rather near\nthe top of the page. It's aijpropriate to him. On p. 57\nthere's a message from him to you, about half way down\nthe page. It's appropriate to past conditions balanced up\nwith the present. There's an important word beginning\nwith H. in the sentence. They're appropriate words from\nhim to you. On page 8 there's a description of a place\nhe had to do with.\"\nOn this Mrs. Salter comments: ij\nOn page 8 are the opening lines of the jjlay, and Jebb's\ncommentary printed just below begins :\n\" Scene.\u2014The\nsame as in the (Edipus Tyramms, viz. an open space\nbefore the royal palace ... at Thebes.\" I think it may\nfau-ly be said therefore that \"on the 8th page there is a\nreference to a place you'll recognise, rather near the top of\nthe page. It's appropriate to (my father) \" and again \" on\np. 8 there's a description of a place he had to do with.\"\nMy father certainly had to '\"do with \" Thebes, not only\nas a classical scholar, but also as having edited the Seven\nagainst Thebes of iEschylus.\nOn p. 57 the passage which would appear to be indicated\nis Jebb's translation of Antig. 255-256 :\n\" The dead man\nwas veiled from us, not shut within a tomb, but lightly\nstrewn with dust, as by the hand of one that shunned a\ncurse.\" (The Guard is describing the finding of Polynices'\niThe shelf was not quite clearly described, but I think there is no\nreal doubt as to which was meant.\n\fLXXXI.] Examination of Book-Tests. 319\nbody after Antigone has covered it with earth.) When\nI first read these words I did not think they were appro-\npriate as a message from my father, but when I read\nJebb's comment on Hne 256 (the note begins on p. 57,\njust below the translation and runs on to p. 58) I found\nthat he quotes as a jjarallel passage Horace, Odes, 1. 28,\n. . . This particular ode of Horace has figured pro-\nminently in reports on scripts, see e.g. Proceedings S.P.R.,\nVols. XXII., XXIV., XXVI. It is, moreover, associated\nwith my father because the origin of the \" Horace Ode\nQuestion \" [so much discussed in Proceedings] was a letter\nwritten by Mr. Myers to mj^ father expressuig disagree-\nment with something my father had said in an essay\nconcerning this Ode (see Proceedings S.P.R.., Vol. XXII.,\np. 406). Also, in my father's edition of --^^schylus' Seven\nagainst Thebes, in his comments on lines 1028-1030, spoken\nby Antigone, he writes :\n\" She explains her meaning in\nline 1030. The expression is intentionally contemptuous.\nTo what purpose is it to forbid biirial, when the handful\nof earth necessary for the rite can be carried in a maiden's\nrobe ? The requirement of religion was satisfied by the\nmere sprinlding of dust three times upon a corpse. Cf.\nSoph. Ant. 255 (see Jebb, p. 57) . . . Hor. Od. I. 28 . .\n.\"\nIf the passage in Jebb, p. 57, is the one indicated by\nFeda, presumably the \" important word beginning with\nH.\" is Horace.\nIt is the apparent reference to Horace's Odes I., 28,\nthat here constitutes the connexion with other S.P.R.\nwork. But it was published work, and there is therefore\nno evidence of any supernormal knowledge apart from\nthe essence of the book-test\u2014namely, the absence of any\nnormal knowledge of what was on the page indicated.\nI have quoted more of the record than is required to\nbring out the reference to the Horace Ode, because the\nrest perhaps connects this book-test with the next one\u2014that\ngiven at Mrs. Salter's next sitting on January 14, 1918.\nOn this occasion U. V. T. acted as recorder : at the\nNovember sitting Mrs. Salter had recorded for herself.\nThe record begins as follows :\n\f320 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nF. {s.v. What you say ?)

He says he's got another one to-day, it's a little dis-\nconnected with the previous one. He tried to get\none what would fit in with and follow on the other\nexperiment. He couldn't do that, but he says that\nso long as he tells you when a test is disconnected\nit's almost as good as if it were connected. ...

It's\nrather a peculiar message he says, but he wants to\ngive them rather differently to the \\^'ay other peoples\ndoes.

It has a long introduction of\neighty-two pages, but Mrs. Salter found nothing relevant\non p. 73 of the introduction. Turning to the text of the\nplay, the words from Jebb's translation which appear\non the upper part of p. 73 are part of a conversation\nbetween (Edipus and his daughter Ismene relating to\nthe question whether GEdipus's death and burial should\ntake place in Thebes or Attica. Beginning at the fourth\nline from the top of the page, the passage runs thus :\nOe. Will they also shroud me in Theban dust 1\nIs.

And who hath told thee what thou tellest, my child ?\nIs. Sacred envoys from the Delphian hearth.\nMrs. Salter notes that she can find in these words no\npersonal message\nbearing on [her] relations \"wdth some person on the earth\nplane, but [adds] the choice of this passage appears to be\nof some interest in connexion with [Mr. Piddington's]\nj)aper on \" The One Horse Dawn Experiment.\" I have\nmarked the line which I understand he takes as\nhaving a reference to his paper [viz. By force of thy\nwrath, etc.]. The Avords \" take their stand \" are under-\nlined in pencil in the text, and in the margin in my\nfather's wi-iting are the words \" be stoj)ped by,\" i.e. he\ndissents from Jebb's rendering and substitutes another of\nhis own. The holding up of the invaders at the tomb of\nOedipus is, I beheve, the jooint of interest to [Mr. Pidding-\ntonj, so that this marginal note of my father's may have\nsome relevance. The line I have marked is two and a\nquarter inches from the top of an eight and a half-inch page.\nD. is said to be an important word connected with the import\nof the message, that is the first letter of it. Presumably this\nM'ord is \" Delphian,\" since the message Ismene is bringing to\nOedipus has been told by envoys from the oracle at Delphi.\nThe statement that either on j). 73 or the opposite\np. 7 2 there is a number or word in different characters to the\nusual would seem to apply best to p. 72, the upper half\nof which is occupied by the Greek text corresponding\nto the translation on p. 73. But the notes occup3dng\nthe lower halves of both pages are pej^pered over with\nwords in Greek type. On p. 72, in a note concerning\n\" a kinsman's blood,\" are quoted two Greek words with\nthe root yeve, suggesting \" Genesis,\" and in the same\nnote is a reference to the burial rite given by Antigone\nto Polynices. The remarks about the book not being.\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 323\na popular one but interesting to Dr. Verrall are obviously\ntrue. But as to her father's having \" had opportunities\nsince he died of becoming acquainted with the subject\nof that book \"\n\u2014\ni.e. the death of (Edipus\n\u2014\" of under-\nstanding it in a different way to what [he] could ... on\nthe earth plane,\" or to the mention on or near p. 73 of a\nsu-bject upon which he has changed his mind since he\npassed over, Mrs. Salter had no suggestion to make unless\nit were that the subject may be death.\nIt is worth noting that in both these book-tests the\npassages indicated occur in plays of Sophocles edited by\nJebb. Both passages refer to burial, or at least to the\nshrouding in dust which formed an essential part of\nfuneral rites, and in both cases we are led to footnotes\nby Jebb dealing with this subject\u2014the footnote in the\n(Edipus Coloneus of the second book-test referring to the\nAntigone of the first ; while in the rirst book-test the\nfootnote refers to Horace's Odes I, 28, which not only\nis itself a topic connected with S.P.R. work, but again\nrefers to the shrouding with dust. There is therefore\na certain connexion between the two book-tests which\nmay have been more than accidental, notwithstanding\nFeda's statement that A. W. V. had failed \" to get one\nthat would fit in with and follow on the other experiment.\"\nHowever this may be, there certainly seems to be a\nconnexion, as Mrs. Salter observes, between the book-test\nof January 14, 1918, and a paper Mr. Piddington had been\nengaged in writing between November 8 and December\n22, 1917, entitled F^irther Light on the One Horse Davm\nExperiment, the point of which was to show that an old\nman in wliite going towards the East, spoken of a good\nmany times in Mrs. Verrall's script in the course of that\nexperiment,^ and in her script and that of other auto-\n1 It will be remembered that the \"One horse dawn experiment\" was\none in which Dr. Verrall in his lifetime tried, without Mrs. Verrall's\nknowledge, to get a certain Greek phrase from Euripides to emerge in\nher automatic script. The success was only partial, but interesting.\nMrs. Verrall's account of it will be found in Proceedings, Vol. XX.,\npp. 156-167. There have been various discussions on it, the last being\nthe paper by Mr. Piddington in Proceedings, Vol. XXX., p. 176, re-\nferred to in the text.\n\f324 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nmatists later, was CEdipus dressed in funeral garb and\npassing to Ms death. He showed that QSdipus was\nconnected with the One-Horse Dawn experiment by a\nnote in Jebb's edition of the CEdipus Tyrannus, which\nquotes the phrase from Euripides which was the subject\nof the experiment, and also refers to passages in the\nQiJdipus Goloneus\u2014the book selected for the book-test\n\u2014\nthese passages being also apparently referred to in the scripts\nconnected with the old man in white. Mr. Piddington's\npaper was never read to the Society, and was not pub-\nlished till November, 1918 (see Proceedings S.P.B., Vol.\nXXX., p. 176). He had, however, mentioned the matter\nvaguely to Mrs. Salter on November 14, 1917^\u2014the day\nbefore the first of the two book-tests.\nAllowing for a great deal of confusion, I think we may\ngo further than Mrs. Salter does in noting a connexion\nbetween the paper and the book-test, and may trace\na definite attempt at not only reference to, but comment\non, the subject of the paper. On this supposition the\nreference to a passage in the CEdipus Goloneus referring\nto his burial may fairly be taken as a personal message\nfrom A. W. V., and as having a bearing on Mrs. Salter's\nattitude to some one on the earth plane\u2014namely Mr.\nPiddington. The important word D, \" connected with the\nimport of the message,\" might be Dawn ; it will be\n^ The following is a memorandum written by Mr. Piddington on\nNov. 17, 1917, after seeing the record of the book-test of Novem-\nber 14 :\n\" On Wednesday, Nov. 14, 1917, I had a few minutes' conversation\nwith Mrs. Salter, in the course of which I told her that I thought\nI had found the explanation of various references in the [One Horse\nDawn] M.

I am quite certain that I did not mention\nSophocles or any of his plays.\"\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 325\nnoticed that nothing is said by Feda about its being a\nword in the selected passage. The \" line of his own\n\"\non which A. W. V. wants to give messages might be\ncross-correspondences or connexion with other S.P.R.\nwork. The opportunities of understanding that book in\na different way from what he could before might refer\nto what he now knows about the introduction of (Edipus\nand Jebb's note on o\/o^wi'oi' into the One-Horse Dawn\nexperiment\u2014for neither Dr. Verrall nor the automatist,\nMrs. Verrall, had perceived this at the time\u2014and the\nsubject upon which he had changed his mind would be\nthe idea that he was the sole agent in that experiment,\nor that it worked out simply as a partially successful\nattempt at thought transference from himself to his\nwife. Feda's aside about \" Writing ? Oh yes, but\nnothing to do with a book-test ? What about then ?\n\"\nwould refer to the automatic writing, especially of ]\\Irs.\nVerrall in the \" One-Horse Dawn \" experiment.\nPossibly it is some confirmation of the hypothesis that\nMr. Piddington's paper was in the communicator's mind,\nthat when at a Leonard sitting on April 11, 1918,\nA. W. V. again gives a book-test from the (Edi'piis\nColoneus. Feda says that the passage indicated \" refers\nto recent discoveries of a scientific nature, and very\ninteresting to ]\\Ir. Arthur.\" In this case, however, if\nMr. Piddington's paper is meant by the \" recent dis-\ncoveries,\" we must suppose that the reference to the\nCEdijms Coloneus as a whole is all that is significant,\nas nothing markedly relevant is to be found on the\npage indicated (p. 65)^ of either the introduction or the\ntext.\nIt is interesting (though not a book-test) that on\nJanuary 18, 1918, when Mr. Gerald Balfour was the\nsitter and ]\\Ir. Piddington the note taker\u2014both being\npresent at a sitting with Mrs. Leonard for the first time\n\u2014an old man in white turned towards the East was\nmentioned early in the sitting as probably a \" guide.\"\nI quote the relevant part of the record in the footnote\n^ Page 65, however, is occupied by part of the same conversation\nas p. 73, and leads up, therefore, to Oedipus's burial place.\n\f326 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nbelow.^ Mr. Balfour had recently read Mr. Piddington's\npaper in manuscript, and Mr. Piddington happened to\nhave it with him at the sitting shut up in an attache\ncase, and had looked at it in the train coming up to\nthe sitting.\nAnother interesting point in this connexion is the\nfollowing, which, however, is not easy to interpret. On\nFebruary 8, 1918, a Mrs. T. had a sitting with Mrs.\nLeonard\u2014Sir Oliver Lodge taking notes. She was told\nthat on p. 74 (near the top) of the fourth book in the\nsecond shelf from the bottom of a certain set of shelves\nwas to be found \" an encouraging message about the\nbook ^ he was speaking of just now. He hopes that the\nbook ^ will fulfil the hope expressed in this message.\" As\nit turned out, the indication of the position of the test-\nbook was by no means clear. The description of the\nbookshelves was not very accurate, but it was decided\nthat a certain set was meant. It was then doubtful\nwhich was the second shelf from the bottom. Were\nthe two lowest\u2014which were made for music\u2014to be\ncounted or not ? It was decided to ignore them, and\nto count as the shelf meant the second of those con-\ntaining reading books. Then there was a doubt whether\nin arriving at the fourth book a pamphlet of sixteen\npages, almost hidden, was to be counted. Counting\nthis, the fourth book was a volume of poems by\n1 [After one or two preliminary words] \" There is two spirits here\n\u2014\ntwo elderly gentlemen. . . . Both pleased to see you. . . .

Verrall read :\n\" A\nFurther Account oi Experiments in Automatic Writing,\"\nincluding an account of the \" One-Horse Dawn \" experi-\nment. The fourth line on p. 74 begins a paragraph\nin a speech by Sir Oliver Lodge as follows :\nMrs. Verrall seemed to be of opinion that this was not\na case of telepathy between herself and the lady con-\ncerned, but that there might be some further inteUigence\nat work. This he felt himself, not only in this instance,\nbut Avith regard to the first experiment [i.e. the \" One\nHorse Dawn \" experiment] that it was possibly not Dr.\nVerraU's mind actmg upon Mrs. Verrall's, but some other\ninteUigence, that was trying to give the sentence required.^\nThis does not seem to correspond very well with the\ndescription given of the message that was to be found.\nNor was the book containing it found in what appeared\nto be the place described. But it is remarkably appro-\npriate to Mr. Piddington's paper, to which, as shown\nabove, other book-tests may refer. Was this pure coin-\ncidence ? Or was it intended by the communicator at\n]\\'Irs. T.'s sitting with IMrs. Leonard ? Or can we suppose\nin cases like this and the \" Charolois \" case above\n(p. 271) that the investigators are perhaps supernormally\nguided to the book 1 '\nBut then how account for the\n1 That there was probably some other inteUigence concerned is of\ncoiirse the moral of Mr. Piddington's paper. It is therefore worth\nmentioning that he had, till after the verification of Mrs. T.'s book-test,\nentirely overlooked and forgotten this discussion of the \" One-Horse\nDawn\" experiment in 1903. It was only after being told by Sir\nOliver Lodge about the result of this book-test that he included the\nreference to the meeting in Appendix D of his paper {Proc.

It is interesting that, as he informs us,\nMrs. T. told him that on turning up p. 74 of the Journal\nfor 1903, she felt a certainty that it was the page meant,\nthough she did not understand the application\nThis is, I think, all that occurred connecting book-\ntests with Mr. Piddington's paper.

I think the book-test is worth quoting,\nnotwithstanding the fact that there is a doubt\u2014due\nperhaps to confusion caused by interruptions by the sitter\n\u2014as to which of two rooms and shelves Peda intended to\ndescribe, and that the first interpretation produced no\nappropriate result.

V. B. in June, 1917,\nthat she should try to get at least a few words of this\nverse written in Mrs. Salter's automatic script. ]\\Irs.\nSalter was at that time unacquainted with Mrs. Leonard,\nand knew nothing of the experiment, but it was explained\nto A. V. B. who she was, and the verse ^\nwas carefully\nrepeated to Feda, who practically knew it by heart.\nOn one or two occasions A. V. B. said that she thought\nshe had succeeded, but as it was understood from Mr.\nPiddington (who saw Mrs. Salter's scripts) that she had\nnot done so, she was told that the experiment had\napparently failed. It is to this she refers in the words :\n\" what she tried to do and practically failed in.\"\nAnother cross-correspondence experiment is referred to\nin the statements by Feda above given\u2014one said to have\nbeen initiated by A. V. B. herself, who according to\nFeda had for some little time been endeavouring to\ninfluence the semi-automatic or \" inspirational \" writing\nof one of Mrs. Leonard's sitters, the Rev. C. Drayton\nThomas, referred to above by Feda as '\nthe parson.\"\nHe knew experiments were being attempted, and sent\nhis script to M. R. H. for comparison. She had\nreceived a batch on January 19, four days before the\nsitting under discussion, and had read it but not ex-\namined it carefully. Mr. Thomas's last sitting with\nMrs. Leonard had been on January 3, 1918.\nSo far in explanation of the allusions made by Feda\nin the above extracts from the sitting of January 23.\nBut both the book indicated and Mr. Thomas's script\n\fLxxxi.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 331\nseem to correspond\u2014not so much with the stanza from\nM. R. H.'s poem which I have quoted and which Feda\nknew, as with two later stanzas which it is very im-\nprobable she had ever heard or seen. The poem, as\nalready said, had not been printed. These stanzas describe\nthe snow-clad earth as a woman lying at rest :\nThe runners of our sleigh scarce mar\nThe \\'irgin wliiteness stretching far\nBeyond the road on every side,\nIn folds of silence, soft and wide.\nThe great earth has no heed or care\nFor two lone travellers, everywhere\nHer spirit seems to contemplate\nSome inner myster3'' of fate.\nImpassive, wonderful and still.\nShe bows to the Creator's will,\nWith pale hands folded on her breast,\nResigned and happy and at rest.\nYet deep within her heart who knows\nWhat throbbing vein of rapture flows\nAs like a Saint of bygone days,\nShe ponders the Almighty's ways.\nThe test-book (according to the second interpretation\nof its place, made without reference to its content)\nwas Fair Rosamond, by Thomas Miller. On p. 83,\nbeginning on the ninth line, in a page of thirty-seven\nlines, occur the following words :\nWe have seen the white woman, and I have stood\nwithm a lance's length of her, and she seemed asleep, with\nall that look of \"winning misery, which leads mankind to\npity her, when she seizes on them, and sinks into the\ndeep earth.\nAs in the poem, there is a reference here to a mystical\nwhite woman asleep and connected with the earth.\nIn Mr. Thomas's script of January 17, 1918, were\nfound, on examination by M. R. H. (among a great\ndeal that appeared to her suggestive only of the sub-\n\f332 Mrs. Henry Sidg^vick. [fart\nconscious Mr. Thomas), the following words in a little\nline by themselves :\n\" Saints everlasting rest.\" These\nwords may be the result of an attempt by A. V. B. to\nget through Mr. Thomas an allusion to the last stanza\nof M. R. H.'s poem, where the snowclad earth is compared\nto a saint at rest. If so, we have in the poem the\n\" link up \" with the book-test of January 23, 1918, of\nwhich Feda speaks above, and we can understand why\na great point is made of getting this particular test\nthrough on this particular day\u2014the first on which M. R. H.\nand U. V. T. had a sitting after Mr. Thomas' script was\nproduced.\nIt should be said that other remarks about the test-\nbook were not very satisfactory. A word like \" swahng\nor soualing \" stated to be at the beginning, could not be\nfound, and a frontispiece said to be in that book or the\none next it was not well described, though it was true\nthat the test-book had a frontispiece.\nIn view of the failure to describe clearly the place\nwhere the book of this book-test stood, M. R. H. and\nU. V. T. had the curiosity to examine the eighty-fifth\npage of the ninth book in several other shelves. Nowhere\non any of these pages was there found anything even\nvaguely suggestive of M. R. H.'s poem. It is perhaps\nnoteworthy that in a second book-test attempted immedi-\nately afterwards at the same sitting, the description given\nof the situation of the book was so vague and indefinite\nthat no attempt was made by the sitters to identify it.\nFeda complained that A. V. B. \" can't make out where\nit is. She once saw it as if it were lying on top of\nsome things on the table, but as she saw it some time\nago she don't suppose it's there now.\" Yet a good\ndeal is said about the appearance of the book, its size,\netc., and wide margins ; and it is asserted that on p. 27\nwould be found something \" that you certainly never\nmeant as a prophecy, but which has now turned out\nas a prophecy, and a true one too.\" Feda continues :\n\" She can't give Feda the position on that page, but\nshe looked to Feda as if she was pointing half way\ndown, but there's not an awful lot of writing on one\nI\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 333\npage, and that makes it difficult because it's spreaded\nout.\"\nOn January 30, 1918, at an A. V. B. sitting, it is\nagain distinctly stated that a cross-correspondence is\nbeing attempted. After referring unmistakably to Mr.\nGerald Balfour, who had recently had two sittings with\nMrs. Leonard, Feda says :\nIt's got something to do with him. Wait a minute.\n(s.v. Tliis is by way of being a little cross.) [Then very\nloud] : Cross-correspondence . . . {s.v.

On p. 71, and also on p. 70\nfacing it, is a list of bee-plants, wild flowers, etc.. men-\ntioned in Latin poetry, with references to Virgil, Horace,\nOvid. Perhaps the word \" Casia \" on p. 71, just above\nthe middle (\" Casiam \" on p. 70) may be the one specially\nreferred to. There is a good deal about bee-plants in\nthe scripts of various automatists (see especially Pro-\nceedings, Vol. XXV., pp. 246-248, on Mrs. Holland's\nscript of March 2, 1910) ; but if the communicator means\nthat some attempt was being made at the time to get\nMrs. Salter to write about bee plants, it failed.\nThe next apparent attempt at a cross-correspondence\nwas in an A. V. B. book-test on May 15, 1918. This-\nhas already been partly quoted and discussed in another\nconnexion (see above p. 278). In the cross-correspondence,\nif it was one, the titles only of selected books are referred\nto, not the insides, so that I have hesitated about includ-\ning it here, but have decided to do so because it seems\nto me sufficiently interesting and perhaps illuminating\nto be well v\/orth study. A. W. V. was represented as\nco-operating with A. V. B., but Mrs. Salter, it must be\nremembered, was not present. Feda says :\nNow the shelf she's on now is the one underneath the\nfirst test shelf, and on this shelf, to the very left, left\nof this shelf underneath the first test sheK. {s.v.

He says bridges can't be\nbuilted from one side only.\nAnd so forth, as quoted on p. 279, leading on to the\nindication of a book, the title of which, The Unseen\nWorld, suggests what is being bridged over.\nIt was decided by the sitters on examination that the\nfirst of the two books indicated in this extract must be the\nthird book from the left, entitled Nova Solyma\u2014or, as\nmore fully described on the title page, \" Nova Solyma.\nThe Ideal City or Jerusalem Regained.\" It deals with\nthe voyage of a man to this ideal city.^ The New\nJerusalem is not an inappropriate watchword for those\nengaged in seeking for evidence of survival and a better\nworld, as M. R-. H. and U. V. T. were doing.\nThe second of the two books indicated the sitters\ntook to be Kiphng's Captains Courageous, which was\nthree volumes off from Nova Solyma, and the title of\nwhich might, by a stretch, be taken as an alternative\nto \" bridge builders \" for pioneers in psychical research.\nFrom the point of view of possible cross-correspondences,\nhowever, the main interest of the passage I have quoted\ncentres in \" bridge builders,\" which is not apparently\nassociated by Feda T^ith any particular book but serves as\na link between the two books indicated. Later in the\nsitting, after book-tests had been disposed of, Feda stated\nthat A. V. B. had tried to get a message through to\nM. R. H. somewhere else, and Feda suggested that this\nmessage might have got mixed up with some one else's\nsitting. This is of course conceivable, and it might have\nhappened without any one realising it. But Feda sud-\ndenly introduced the name IVIrs. Nellie {i.e. Mrs. Salter),\nsaying, \" Do you know if JVIrs. NeUie's been anywhere ?\n\"\nand again, \" Feda feels it's something to do mth Mrs.\nNeUie, and that's perhaps what brought Mr. Arthur here\nas well as the book-test.\" ^\n1 It was translated from the Latin original by the Rev. Walter\nBegley, and attributed by him to Milton, though the authorship is\nunknown.\n2 At the beginning of this sitting surprise had been expressed by\nFeda at \" Mr. Arthur's \" coming. She continued, \" He's pleased tO'\n\f336 Mrs. Henry SidgivicJc. [part\nOn seeing the report of this sitting it at once struck\nMrs. Salter, who had not very recently been to any sitting\nof any kind (her last was with Mrs. Leonard on April\n23rd), that the intention might be to say that there had\nbeen some recent attempt to send a message through her\nown automatic script. She accordingly looked this up.\nHer script of April 27th\u2014the only piece produced by her\nbetween Feb. 15th and May 23rd\u2014(the day on which she\nfirst saw the record of the Leonard sitting under discus-\nsion) was very scrappy. It begins :\n\" Vanitas vanitatum\n\u2022\n\u2014the bridge and the river\u2014misericordiam Domini. . .\n.\"\nTaking account of the occurrence of \" bridge,\" both in\nthis script and at the Leonard sitting, and the sugges-\ntion at the latter that a connexion with Mrs. Salter is to\nbe sought, it seems very possible that we have here an\nattempt at a cross-correspondence, which has only partially\nsucceeded\u2014the failure being perhaps in Mrs. Salter's script\nwhich got as far as bridge, but not to bridge builders.\nMrs. Salter has had earlier references to a bridge in her\nscript, and in Mrs. Verrall's script are references to bridge\nbuilding. See, for instance, a script of Mrs. Verrall's of\nFebruary 25, 1907, quoted in a paper by Mr. Piddington\nin Proceedings, Vol. XXVI., p. 236.\nI stretch my hand across the vaporous space . . . the\nlucid interspace of world and world. Well that is bridged\nby the thought of a friend bridged before for your passage\nbut to-day for the passage of any that will walk it, not in\nhope but in faith. The bridge has been built from our\nside, it is our thought that builds it\u2014but it rests on a\npier of your founding\u2014not yours\u2014of you only\u2014of all of\nyours.\nThis speaks of building and to some extent of building\nfrom both ends ; but in a much later script of Mrs.\nVerrall's\u2014October 17, 1915\u2014a script that has not been\npubhshed\u2014is written \" bridge builders are we all, and a\ncome, but he has a funny feejing that some one asked him to come,\nor suggested his coming, he doesn't laiow quite which, but he had\na feeling he'd caught a current as if some one had asked him to come\nhere and wondered if he'd give a message.\"\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Boole-Tests. 337\nbridge must be built from both sides\/' which is almost\nexactly the expression put by Feda into the mouth of\nDr. Verrall.\nThe New Jerusalem or the Heavenly City, it may be\nremarked, is also a topic of Mrs. Verrall's scripts, as\nreaders of Mr. Piddington's paper on the Horace Ode\nQuestion in Proceedings, Vol. XXVI. (see pp. 185-211, or\nin particular, p. 157), are aware. An association of ideas\ntaking us from a metaphorical \" New Jerusalem \" to the\nbuilding of a metaphorical bridge leading thereto is not\nunnatural.\nAnother kind of association of ideas, it is worth noticing,\nmay be responsible for the transition from \" bridge\nbuilders \" to Captains Courageous.\" The latter, as\nalready said, is the title of a volume of Kipling's works\n\u2014\nand there is a story called The Bridge Builders in\nanother volume of his.^ Mrs. Salter tells us that Dr.\nVerrall was a great admirer of some of Kipling's work,\nand that The Bridge Builders was a favourite of his. In\nthe course of conversation with IVIrs. Leonard a fortnight\nafter this sitting, M. R. H. and U. V. T. endeavoured to\nfind out what she Imew of Kipling's books. M. R. H.,\napropos of holiday reading, remarked \" that she did not\nmuch care for novels, but was rather fond of Kipling,\" to\nwhich Mrs. Leonard replied that she was afraid she did\nnot know Kipling, and did not think she had ever read\nanything of his.\nThis apparent attempt at cross-correspondence on May\n23, 1918, is the last I have found in the book-tests sub-\nmitted to me except that of January 4, 1919, considered\nabove (pp. 286-289).\nIn one of the book-tests quoted above\u2014January 14,\n1918 (see p. 320)\u2014Feda represents A. W. V. as saying\nthat \" he wants to give them [i.e. messages] on a line of\nhis own. He says the last one was a bit different\u2014of a\ndifferent tjrpe to the ones what others give.\" This is true\n^ The Day's Work. This volume was actually in another part of the\nbook-case, but there is no indication that the communicators were\naware of this.\n\f338 Mrs. Henry Sidgiviclc. [part i\nif the connexions pointed out above between some of the\nA. W. V. book-tests and S.P.R. work, pubhshed and un-\npubhshed, was intentional ; for it certainly occurs more in. 1\nproportion in A. W. V. book-tests than in others. There i\n'\nare moreover differences in type, though not very easy to\ndefine, in other series. The question may be asked '\nwhether through these differences of type in the\n\" messages,\" or through the appropriateness of some of\nthem to the circumstances, tastes, or character of the\nsupposed communicator, we can get evidence of his\nidentity. I do not think that, except in Mrs. Talbot's\ncase described in \u00a7 2, this evidence is clear and definite\nenough to be of much use by itself ; and it is often of\ncourse difficult to judge how far the selection may be\ninfluenced by the sitter's mind, or by the library selected ;\nfrom. But the appropriateness of some \" messages \" un- |\ndoubtedly adds to the weight of evidence for the identity |\nof communicators afforded by appropriateness to them of i\ncommunications in manner and matter\u2014an appropriateness\nmanifested in communications concerning other things as i\nwell as book-tests. The main interest of book-tests as '\ni\nsuch, however, lies not in the evidence they may afford\n]\nfor the identity of the communicators, but in the evidence\nj\nfor clairvoyance.

'\nI PROPOSE in this section to put together some instances\nwhere there seems evidence of a genuine mistake in\nindicating the shelf, volume, or page. \u2022\nBy a genuine mistake I mean that though the com-\nmunicator was trying to convey to the sitter something\nthat he really knew, yet, through confusion of his own or\nFeda's, the indication received was false. A genuine\nmistake implies real knowledge. A mere statement that\nsomething will be found in a place where it is not found\nmay, of course, be a genuine mistake, but there is gener-\nally no evidence that it is. So far as internal evidence\ngoes, it may just as well be a random aiid erroneous\n'5\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 339\nguess. If, however, two or more things are predicated of\n(say) a particular page, and turn out to be true of another\npage, then there is evidence as far as it goes, that the\nwrong page has been named by mistake.\nI called attention on p. 269 above to a case where\nthere seemed reason to think that a genuine mistake\noccurred about the bookcase intended. In the case I will\nnow quote it seems possible that the row of books in a\nset of shelves was given wrongly, though one could wish\nthat the test had been a little more definite and successful.\nThe sitting in question was the A. V. B. one of Sep-\ntember 18, 1918 :\nF. Now she wants to give a book-test. She says it's in\n;\n\u2022 the big lot of books in London [that is, a set of\nshelves in M. R. H.'s study]. Now it's the third\nrow of books up. She says \" I'm not saying-\nshelves to-day, it's the third roiv.'\"\nM. R. H, She's counting the books on the floor I suppose.\nF. Yes she's counting the books on the floor. It's the\nsixth book from the left. She says \" He feels like\na friend of mine.\" There's a funny name con-\nnected with this book beginning with V. She says\n\" I was going to say Vodka, but I don't think\nthat's right, but it's a name like that.\" She says\nyou won't have to hunt for the name, you'll find\nalmost immediately that it has a great deal to do\nwith the book. Now take this book and open it\nat two, four, page twenty-four, and about a third\nof the way doAvn the page you'll find a message\nwhich will take you back to conditions connected\nwith the last year of Ladye's earth life. She's\nalso giving Feda a name beginning with a G that\nshould either be on that jsage, or in close\nproximity to it, beginning with a G, but it felt to\nher like Gwendoline.\nThe phrase \" He feels like a friend of mine \" is inter-\npreted by the sitter as meaning that the book selected\nwas one A. V. B. had known well in her lifetime.^ This\n1 Feda is liable to use \"he\" and \"him\" for \"it.\"\n\f340 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. '. [part\ncannot be affirmed of the sixth book in the third row up,\nnor in this book can any other things said about the\ntest-book be discovered. On the other hand, the sixth\nbook in the shelf below, which was The Life of Voltaire by\nS. G. Tallentj^re, was a great favourite of A. V. B.'s. It\nhad been read aloud by her to M. R. H., and because\nthey both liked it so much was specially bound by\nA. V. B. and given by her to M. R. H. It contains an\ninscription to this effect in A. V. B.'s writing. If this\nwas the book, the name beginning with V, like \" Vodka,\"\nand that has a great deal to do with the book, must be\n\" Voltaire.\" The name like \" Gwendoline \" on p. 24 or in\nclose proximity to it must be \" Genonville,\" which occurs\ntwice on p. 25. The message about a third of the way\ndown p. 24, which was to take M. R. H. back to con-\nllitions connected with the last year of A. V. B.'s earth\n\/ife, cannot, however, be found ;\nunless, indeed, it consists\nin the name \" Oedipe.\" Pages 24 and 25 both deal with\nthis play of Voltaire's, and the name occurs twice on\np. 24, and three times in the first third of p. 25, facing\np. 24. In the last year of A. V. B.'s life she had an\nalarming affection of the sight which led M. R. H. to\nfear she might be going blind, and the name Oedipus of\ncourse suggests blindness. This suggestion for the \" mes-\nsage \" is, however, rather far fetched, and none of the\ntest is definitely successful enough for us to lay much\nstress on it. But if we accept the genuineness of book-\ntests on other grounds, this one is suggestive of a possibly\ngenuine mistake about the shelf.\nA possibly genuine mistake about the volume intended\noccurred at an A. V. B. sitting on December 8, 1918.^\nThree \" messages \" were given from three different pages\nof what was described as the fifth volume from the end\nof the shelf. This proved to be a copy of the Bible, and\nthe failure to find anything relevant was complete. But\njust before the fifth book was mentioned, a picture of a\nlady- described as somewhat out of proportion, had been\n^ This was a day on which tests from the experimental Greek books\nwere attempted, but in the earlier section of the book-tests, with which\nwe are here concerned, English books were referred to.\n\fLxxxi.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 341\nspoken of as easily to be found in one of the first few\nbooks on the left-hand side of the shelf. Such a drawing\nwas found as the frontispiece of the seventh book\u2014the\nonly book in the left-hand half of the shelf with any\npictures in it at all. This led the sitters to look in this\nseventh book for possible messages conforming to indica-\ntions given for the fifth book. The result was that on\neach of the three pages named, and in the position on\nthe page described, what might be regarded as an appro-\npriate message was found. The appropriateness is not of\nthe simple and obvious kind which can be seen by any\none at a glance. It requires in each instance a good deal\nof explanation. This explanation M. R. H. gives, and in\nmy opinion makes out a reasonable case. I will not\ntrouble the reader with it here, but if he wishes to judge\nfor himself he will find the particulars in Appendix C,\np. 393. The fact that \" messages \" regarded as appro-\npriate by a sitter who is not very easily satisfied, were\nfound in the assigned places in the seventh volume and\nnot at all in the fifth, suggests strongly that it was the\nseventh volume that was intended and not the fifth\u2014that,\nin fact, a genuine mistake had occurred.\nWe have one or two instances of apparent confusion\nbetween two volumes used on the same day in book-tests\n\u2014an item belonging to one being assigned to the other\nand vice versa. A possible case of this occurred on July\n17, 1918, at a sitting I have referred to more than once\n(pp. 300, 360, 362), and will be found in Appendix C, p. 394.\nBut a more striking case of what looks like a genuine\nmistake of this kind occurred in an A. W. V. sitting of\nFebruary 28, 1918. I had better quote the greater part\nof the book-tests of that day, as there are other elements\nof interest in them. The communicator. Dr. Verrall,\nhaving with some dilficulty described the shelf, Feda says :\n\" The third book\u2014wait\n\u2014\n{s.v. : Wait a minute seven\nthree\u2014not three seven) ... the 73rd page, near the\ntop . . .

But he means it\nalso as something that embraces\u2014embraces you too.\"\n[The book jjroved to be H. G. Wells' First and Last\nThings : A Confession of Faith and Rule of Life. P. 73 is\npart of a section called \" Indi\\aduality an Interlude.\"\nWells is talking of what he calls \" the synthesis of the\nspecies,\" \" the real solidarity of humanity,\" and on page 72\nand 73 he is dealing with the physical synthesis of the\nhuman race due to the intermingling of ancestry from the\nearliest times. It is difficult to find anything appropriate\nas a message to the sitter (Mrs. Salter) from her parents,\nbut there seems distinctly a point in emphasizing the word\n\" Unity \" as descriptive of what Wells is saying. At the\ntop of p. 73 the words \" link of blood \" might perhaps be\ntaken as the message. At the bottom of p. 72, opposite\np. 73, occurs the sentence \" One Tartar chieftain in the\nSteppes may have given a daughter to a Roman soldier\nand sent his grandsons east and west to interlace the\nbranches of every family tree in the world.\" I quote this\nfor a reason that will appear presently.]\nAfter giving another item from the same book, which to\nmake easier reading I have relegated to Appendix C (see\np. 396), Feda continues :\nFurther along on the same shelf, {s.v. Wait a minute\nwill you please.) It's a book what is called number eight,\nit's from right to left still, eighth book ... he can't\ngive you the page in this, but the beginning of the\nbook, the beginning of the proper part of it touches\non a subject he was very interested in but only tem-\nporarily, but you will remember, in fact he's quite sure\n: there are books or papers in existence which will prove he\nwas interested in it.

Both methods of counting appear to be\nused, and from an explanation attributed by Feda to Dr.\nVerrall on April 11, 1918 \"The fifth book, not the fifth from\nthe first [from which tests had just been taken] but\ncounting the first \" looks as if counting from the book\npreviously referred to seemed to him the more natural plan.'-\nAs the eighth book from the previous one gives the best\nresults, I will assume that was meant. It was a school\nedition of Racine's Les Plaideurs published in 1887. This\nit will be remembered is a skit on law courts and litiga-\ntion. Now Dr. Verrall read law for three years, and was\ncalled to the bar, though he did not practice, before he\nreturned to Cambridge to take nj) the work of teaching\nclassics. A reference to law as a temporary but very\nimportant interest of his, and one with which the book is\nconnected, is therefore appropriate. There is, no doubt,\ndocumentary evidence to prove his interest in law ; and\nthere is also documentary evidence to prove his interest in\nthe play. For in 1907 this play and one of Moliere's were\nacted at Cambridge, and Dr. Verrall, much interested in the\nperformance, wrote two articles on them in the Cambridge\nReview. In the second of these he referred to the well-\nknown speech of Petit-Jean, and raised a small literary\npoint concerrung one line of it. This speech begins about\nhalfway down p. 99 of the selected book\u2014a fact I shall\nhave to refer to presently.]\nFeda continues :\n\"...

Some-\nthing that she thinks could be applied to the war and its\neffect upon conditions.\nThe book proved to be The Scarlet Pimpernel by\nBaroness Orczy, translated into Spanish. No appropriate\nmessage was found on p. 98, nor were the other state-\nments true of that page. P. 99, facing it, was on the\nright-hand side. It had an unbroken paragraph occupying\nthe first twelve lines of a page of thirty-four lines\u2014another\nbeginning with line 13\u2014and below the middle of the\npage, between half and two-thirds down, occurs the sen-\ntence \" the brave man who, unknown to fame, had rescued\nhundreds of lives from a terrible often unmerciful fate.\"\nIt is thought that \" terrible,\" in Spanish \" horrendo,\" is\nthe \" something \" in a quite short sentence that could be\napplied to the war. Feda immediately afterwards speaks\nof \" these terrible conditions \" as applied to the war in\ndescribing another book that is to be looked for. One\ncould, as usual, wish the \" message \" had been more\nprecisely described. Still there is one that will pass on\np. 99 though not on p. 98, and two other statements\nmade about p. 98 are not true of that page and are true\nof p. 99.\nAnother instance of the same thing occurred in an\nA. V. B. sitting on September 26, 1917 (see above, p. 294).\nThree statements are made about p. 127 which prove true\nof p. 126 facing it.\nA similar case occurred to Mr. Drayton Thomas on\nNovember 8, 1917. I quoted among verbally accurate\nindications of \" messages \" one on that day (see above,\np. 270). Its only defect was that while described as on\np. 65 it proved to be on p. 64 facing it. Two further\nmessages which followed immediately were assigned to\np. 65 of the same book, but were not to be found there,\nand in Mr. Thomas' opinion were adequately represented on\np. 64. A fourth indication of a message followed, this\n\fLXXXI.] A71 Examination of Book-Tests. 347\ntime assigned to the page opposite p. 65 backwards\n\u2014\nfourth said to be on p. 64 and also found there. This\nlast fact makes the mistake in the other three more diffi-\ncult to understand. But, as already said (p. 270), the\nmistake of a page for that next it, especially facing it, is\na common one. It is discussed with the explanations given\nby the communicators in the next section.\nI have tried to find evidence of what may be called the\nopposite of a genuine mistake, evidence that elaborate\ndescriptions not only correspond to nothing in the place\nindicated but have no real perception behind them at all.\nOf course one suspects this when every item turns out to\nbe wrong in the book-tests of a particular day, which has\nhappened on various occasions ; and in one instance at\nleast there seems to be some definite reason apart from\nmere failure for attributing the book-tests offered to Feda's\nimagination. It is in the A. V. B. sitting of September 4,\n1918. The book-tests were given at the end of a long and\nrather poor sitting, in the course of which, at A. V. B.'s\nrequest, U. V. T. had told her of the successful finding of\nreferences to literal and metaphorical \" heat \" on certain\npages as predicted by Feda on August 28 (see above,\np. 281). The book-tests of September 4 began with a\nsimilar statement about growth ; Feda says that A. V. B.\nis not sure whether a mention of growth on a given page\nwill be of growth vegetable, floral, or mental. No mention\nof growth was found. On August 28 there had been a\ngood description of an unpublished poem of M. R. H.'s ;\non September 4 an attempt is again made to describe a\npoem of hers, but it is not successful, and at best is a\nmixture of two or three published poems. Other items\nappear to be reminiscent of previous book-tests. Altogether\nthe attempt at book-tests of September 4 appears, as\nM. R. H. and U. V. T. say, \"to be a kind of hotch-\npotch of previous tests. It appears to consist of a\nnumber of details carelessly slung together at the last\nmoment of the Feda control, details remembered perhaps\n\f348 Mrs. Henry Sidgividc. [part\nby Feda or picked from [some] stratum of the medium's\nmind.\" At the next A. V. B. sitting (September 11),\nA. V. B., herself controlling, refers to this test having\ngone wrong, and adds :\n\" Do you know I got the scheme\nwrong, somehow it's as if I start a pattern, and if I get\nthe first bit wrong all the other goes wrong too. Wrong f\nlorong ! \" This is an explanation that might perhaps apply\nin some cases, but it is difficult to see how it can do so\nin the case in question.\nIn one or two cases an item definitely suggests guessing.\nFor instance, in an A. V. B. sitting on November 13,\n1918, when the Greek books were being dealt with, Feda\nreports that A. V. B. is reminded of something Syrian\nor Assj^rian,\nAnd small, low houses, built many of them of wood, and\nsomething which she was not sure of, . . . long broad\nstretches of land, but villages dotted here and there . . .\nThe whole book seemed to deal Avith it, and trees with\nstraight trunks . . . the trees had not got nice little\nbranches all the way down, all at the top ! . . . And\npeople Avith robes or gowns ;\nthings wrapped round them.\nSquatting.\nThe book specially referred to was a volume of Euri-\npides. In this case it was known by the control that the\nbooks were in a language unknown to her, and it was\nsuspected that they were in ancient Greek, and this clue\nmay have suggested an eastern country. In an ordinary\nbook-test the possible range is so indefinite that we are\nunaware of any clue at all, and have not therefore any\nmeans of judging whether any one statement is more\nlikely to be a guess than another. The form of the com-\nmunicator's impression in the description just quoted seems\nto have been visual, and it may have been a vision of\neastern scenery called up by association of ideas. On the\nother hand, we may have a purely imaginary description\nof a scene supposed by the communicating intelligence to\nbe appropriate.\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 349\n\u00a79-\nExamination of the Records for Indications of the\nMode of Perception of a Page in a Closed Book.\nAs already mentioned there are a good many cases\nwhere the \" message \" is found not on the page named\nbut in the corresponding position on an adjoining page,\nespecially on the page facing the page named when the\nbook is closed. As the communicator on January 19,\n1918, said to the sitter, Mrs. Kennedy, \" It's awfully\ndifficult for me to see if it's that or that page. (Here\nFeda put her two hands side by side, as if each were one\nside of an open book.) But I'm praptically sure it's 31,\nand it's certainly one of the two, 31 or facing it.\" I have\nin book-tests already quoted given several instances of\nthis. In two cases (p. 346) three things said about\none page proved true of the page facing it\u2014affording\ndistinct evidence of a genuine mistake. In another\u2014the\none in which the communicator having expressed doubt\nwhether heat in a literal or metaphorical sense was\nalluded to 'halfway down the page named, words implying\nsuch meanings were found respectively on that page and\nthe one facing it (see pp. 281-2)\u2014suggesting that facing each\nother thus they had simultaneously impressed themselves\non the communicator. A. V. B. through Feda attempted\non January 10, 1918, to explain the tendency to this\nparticular kind of mistake. I will give the passage.\nSpeaking of an item in a previous book-test which I have\nnot quoted, U. V. T. says :\nU. V. T. There Avas one point that was actually \\^Tong. . . .\nShe gave a message as being on a certain page,\nand instead of being on the page that she gave,\nthe message was on the opposite page, not on the\nopposite side of the page, but on the page that\nlay facing the page she had given . . . it's a\nmistake that she's rather fond of, she's made it\ntwo or three times.\nr. She knows she does that, she says it's most awfully\ndifficult. She says she is not apt to get the other\n\f350 Mrs. Henry Siclgwick. [part\nside of the leaf. It's when the power lies in\nbetween the jDages that it's difficult, she says if\nthe page were open it would be all right, the\ntrouble is sensing it in a closed book. She says\nshe just had to gauge, the way you gauge the\nheight of a certain building, she wonders some-\ntimes that she can find the j^age at all.\nThe sentence was very clear, but on the opposite\npage.\nVery likely and sometimes it will be in the right\nposition on the page.\nYes it was.\nShe says it is so difficult when the pages are touch-\ning each other.\nI give this for what it is worth, but it does not seem\nto furnish much illumination, and I doubt whether either\nPeda or A. V. B. understand very much about the matter\n\u2014at least when communicating.^ As to A. V. B.'s view\nthat she is not apt to get the other side of the leaf\u2014it is\ntrue that this mistake is less common than the one we\nhave been discussing, but it does occur, and I have in\nfact given two instances (see above, pp. 275 and 276,\nA. V. B. book-tests of March 6 and A^vil 3, 1918). In |\neach case the correspondence between the \" message \" and\nwhat had' been said about it was fairly good, and in each\ncase the place on the page was correct, but the page was\nthe one at the back of the page named.\n1 Feda on one occasion (.January 23, 1918) implies that A. V. B.\nis not \" all there \" when communicating. She says \" Feda sometimes-\nthinks when Ladye is saying what that part of her that's in this room\nthinks right, that some part of her mind what can't get through here\n'\nis saying, '\nNo that's not right.' \" On another occasion (April 24, 1918) !|\nFeda says the same sort of thing about herself. \" You know Ladye says\nit's so extraordinary, but she has to act upon Feda sometimes in a way j\nFeda don't understand when she's in the medium, and she was afraid ii\nFeda wouldn't take up the reference to Raymond [Lodge], so she had\nto worry to get a word that would suggest Raymond to Feda ; [she I\nhad talked about dislodging some of the books]. She says she's done !\nthat often and she's wondered if you had guessed she was doing that, j\nand how carefully she has to lead Feda to a new idea. Feda knows-\nthat, 'cos when Feda's in the medium she's only got like half of Feda's\nown sense, she's not half so clever as when she's out of the medium !\n\"\nU. V. T.\nF.\nU. V. T.\nF.\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 351\nIn the course of A. V. B.'s explanation just quoted she\nsays she wonders that she can find the page at all. This\nwonder we shall most of us share with her, and if we\ncould clear the matter up we should probably have gone\na long way towards explaining successful book-tests. In\nwhatever way the pages may be arrived at, they are\nidentified by a number\u2014usually the number printed on\nthem\u2014and the number is conveyed to Feda either by a\nvisual or oral impression. Thus on November 22, 1917,\ndiscussing the failure of the day before (\" Charolois \"\u2014see\nabove, p. 271), Feda says of A. V. B. : \"She showed the\nnumbers to Feda separately, one, two, like that. M. R.\nYes and you said 12.\" In some cases, e.g. the A. W. V.\nsitting of January 4, 1919 (quoted from on p. 286 above),^\nFeda implies that the communicator draws for her the\nnumerals required, or as it is sometimes described, builds\nthem up. Feda says :\nYou open this second book at\u2014what ? Two\u2014um\u2014two\n\u2014\nwait a minute, you've given me two and three. All riglit,,\nI got it wrong, I thought he showed me two and five.\nIt's a three and a five. He made the three not lilce that\n(Feda draws in the air a very curved and defined figure 3).\nbut rather short. (Feda draws in the air a hastily formed\nfigure 3 with very httle curve in the middle and hardly\nany curve up at the lower part.) Like that, not a very\nbig curl round. [As a matter of fact if there was any\nsense in this item of the book-test the page meant was\np. 25, not 35.]\nOn another occasion (A. W. V., October 19, 1918) Feda\nsays to the communicator : \"I can't see the number, build\nit up again\u201448.\" Compare also p. 353 below, \" She's\nbuilding up an 8 distinctly.\" And again, \" Oh, now\nshe's building up another page \" [meaning its number]\n(A. V. B., January 10, 1918). We also have comparisons\nbetween the building up (or the Tvoriting) of different com-\nmunicators. Thus Feda says of Mrs. Verrall, who on\nJanuary 4, 1919, was indicating page 4, \" She makes her\nfours very clear and distinct, not thick and sprawly like\nwith a thick pen, fine ones.\" Again (A. V. B., January 30,\n\f352 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. ^ !\n[PAET\n1918), \"Do you know when Ladye makes what you call\na 1 [the numeral as in 17] she doesn't always make it\nquite clearly. There's a little wobble to him.\"\nIt is clear that methods such as these of making Feda\napprehend the page would be consistent with any mode of\nits apprehension by the communicator. But the statements\nwe get from communicators about this are not very con-\nsistent. There cannot, one would think, be any special\ndifficulty in \" sensing \"\u2014to use their own non-committal\nexpression\u2014the number of a page if other things on the\npage can be \" sensed.\" Indeed the numbers do seem to\nbe sensed, at least in a general way, for on one occasion\n(A. V. B., January 15, 1919) Feda says :\nF. Oh wait a bit\u2014what ? {s.v. Some pages not numbered)\nshe wondered if some pages were not numbered\nU. V. T. Why ?\n^- Not in this book but in one of the foreign books\n[the Greek books] she was sensing she was sure\nthat the pages were not numbered ... it seems\nso strange to her.\n[The pages of a Homer from which some items of the\nbook-tests of this day were taken were not numbered. In\nreferring to the Greek books before, the fact of pages in some\nof them being unnumbered was not alluded to by A. V. B.]\nThe order of proceeding for the communicator, one\nwould suppose, would be first to decide on a \" message \"\nin the book ^ and then ascertain on what page it is ; and\n' Sometimes the communicator offers to throw light on his method of\nselecting messages. Thus, in an A. V. B. sitting of Dec. 4, 1918, we\nfind Feda saying, \" On page 20 of the same book, almost at the top of\nthe page, there seemed to her to be a reference to a clock striking. She\nsays, '\nI'll tell you how I found that, I was trying to get through an\nidea to you suggesting a time for your passing over.' But she says\nshe was disappointed, for all she could get was about a clock striking,\nand it was too vag-ue to give the message, but she thought it would\ninterest you to know what she was looking for and what she got,\nand why she got it.\" As, however, nothing relevant was found either\non p. 20 or the page opposite, we are left in doubt whether the soi-\n-disant A. V. B. was not simply romancing in what she said. The\nbook, by the way, was a new volume, straight from the shop, and so\nfar as the sitters knew, unread by anyone.\n\fLxxxi.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 353\nif his mode of perception were visual he would in general\ndo this most easily by reading the number printed on the\npage. In most cases this seems in fact the simplest\ninterpretation of the phenomena presented to us. But\nthere are difficulties. The following item in the A. V. B.\nbook-tests of October 2, 1918, illustrates one of them :\nF. Take the second book from the right. Eight. Only\neight Ladye ? Wait a minute you must get that\nclear.\nU. V. T. Only eight Ladye ?\nF. Well she's building an eight up distinctly.\nU. V. T. Is that all of the number, Ladye ?\nF. Yes, it's page eight, and the lower part of the page,\n, but not right at the bottom she doesn't think . . .\nis a message about the turning of recent important\nevents in the war. She says recent events, do you\nsee.\nThe book proved to be A Fearful Besponsibility and\nTonellis Marriage by W. D. Howells. As is often done,\nits pages are numbered counting in the title-page, preface,\netc., but no numbers are printed on any pages till the\nopening page of the reading matter proper. This page in\nthe present case is numbered 9, so that there is no page\nmarked 8. The sitters decided that the eighth page from\nthe beginning of the reading matter proper must be\nmeant, namely, the page marked 16. In the lower part\nof this page was found the sentence : \"As Americans,\nthey must respond to any impulse for Freedom,\" etc.,\nwhich seems to conform fairly well to what is said about\nthe \" message \"\u2014the entry of the Americans into the war\na few months previously being a very important recent\nevent and an important cause of the turning of the tide\nin favour of the allies. Now if this really was the sentence\nintended by the communicator, how did she come to call\nthe page, page 8 ? She seems to have hesitated a little\nabout it. Perhaps she had to go through a calculation like\nthe sitters, and perceiving that the first page of the\nreading matter was called p. 9, concluded that p. 16 being\nthe eighth page of reading matter would be regarded as\n\f354 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\np. 8 by the sitters. If so the conclusion was unwise^\nfor there can be no doubt that the sitters would have\nbeen better satisfied by being told to look at p. 16.\nThe communicators, or Feda for them, deny at times,\nhowever, that they see the page-number at all. For |\ninstance, at a sitting on December 2, 1917, during a\nbook-test the following dialogue is reported between the\nsitter (Professor B.) and Feda :\nS. What is the title of the book ?\nF. He doesn't know. He can't read, can't see it. \u2022\n'\n^\nS. Can't read ?\nF. No, he can't read, but he gets a sense of the meaning.\nS. Then how can he read \" Page 87 \" ? %\nF. He does not. He makes an estimate like you would know\nthe height of a tower without measuring it. It's not\nexact.\nS. Who wrote the message ? ..\n(No answer.)\nS. In what language is it ?\nF. Can't tell.\n[The \" message \" was said to be one \" to cheer you up. !\nIt draws a comparison between the past and the present.\"\nA passage conforming to this was found in the correct 1\nsituation on p. 86 [that is, facing p. 87], but it was in a\nvolume not properly speaking in the place indicated in\nthe shelves, though surrounded by other books more or\nless such as described by Feda.]\nAgain, in the book-tests of April 23, 1918, A. W. V. is !\nrepresented by Feda as saying : i\nTurning back in the same book, p. 13, he says many |\npeople have a difficulty in getting the second test . . . it's\n'\na matter of weighing up and calculating, but he's going on\ntrying. |\ni\nThis idea that page numbers are arrived at through '\\\nestimating by measurement, gauging, weighing up, is fre-\nquently mentioned, and it is of course well adapted to |\nexplain how books without page numbers, or partly i\nmutilated, may be dealt with. It is also consistent with I\n\fLxxxi.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 355\nthe assertion that pages over 100 are more difificult to\n\" sense.\" Thus on April 24, 1918, Feda says for A. V. B.\n:\nShe wanted to tell you that she finds it so much easier\nto sense things near the beginning of a book. She gets a\nlittle lost when she gets too deeply into the book. It's\ni;\nlike a man measuring a long length ; the first yard or two\nis accurate, then he loses himself.^\nBut though \" weighing up \" fits certain kinds of cases,\nit does not fit others. How, for instance, when there is a\nlong introduction separately paged from the text, is\n\"weighing up\" applied? Such a case is quoted on p. 321\nabove in the A. W. V. book-test of January 14, 1918 ;\np. 73 is named, but nothing relevant discovered on p. 73\nof an introduction of eighty-two pages. What is believed\nto be the \" message \" is found on p. 73 of the text. Are\nwe to suppose that A. W. V. noticed, or remembered, that\nthere was an introduction and was careful to omit that,\nand only \"weigh up\" from the beginning of the text?\nIf, on the other hand, he observed the number printed on\nthe page and used that to describe it, the matter seems\ncomparatively simple.\nAn}'' difficulty about \" sensing \" the number printed on\na page is presumably of the same nature as that of\ngetting an exact impression of other things on it. And\nabout this there are the same apparent inconsistencies.\nThe communicators are concerned to explain to us that\nthey \" get the idea, the thought, more than the written\nword \" (A. V. B., October 12, 1918). \" I sense a senti-\nment. I don't get the exact words\" (communicator on\nJanuary 19, 1918, book-test quoted from above, p. 349).\n\" She might tell you that two volumes of the same\nsubject or book is one, because, as she explained before,\nshe senses a line of thought or expression more than little\nmaterial things such as bindings and such things \" (A. V. B.,\n1 There are one or two quite good book-tests quoted above with\npages over 100, but I think it is true that pages much over this are\nnot used in the tests under examination. The sceptic might say that\nthis is because of the risk of the book indicated proving to be so\nI small as not to contain a himdred pages.\n\f356 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [paet is?\nJanuary 30, 1918). And of course any genuine \" sensing\nof the Greek books by a communicator ignorant of the\nGreek alphabet imphes that it is the idea, the thought\nmore than the written word, that is apprehended\u2014unless\nthe ignorance disappears on the other side, or the com-\nmunicator is assisted by others who know.\nNevertheless, those readers who have followed so far will\nknow that in some cases at least it seems to be the actual\nword or its appearance that is perceived\u2014not any idea\nbehind it. For instance, \" She thinks there is a date on\nthat page ; it seems like a date because there is a big\nnumber that seems like you would have for a year\n\"\n(A. V. B., September 26, 1917, quoted above, p. 292).\nAnd when we are told, as often happens, that the passage\nindicated is to be taken literally, which means that\nverbally it will serve as a \" message,\" but that its mean-\ning in its own context is to be ignored\u2014awareness of the\nactual words is certainly suggested.\n'\nThere are cases, again, where the communicator calls\nattention to particular letters on a page. For instance, an\nattempt to give a word composed of certain letters on\ncertain pages was made by A. V. B. on February 20,\n1918.^ It came to nothing and may well have been mere\ntalk, so that it cannot be used as evidence that letters as\nsuch are perceived. But in other cases there are indica-\ntions of success. Thus on September 27, 1917, Feda says\nfor the communicator :\n\" She says that the few words she\nhas picked just there have the initials of some of her friends\nand relations.\" At the place in the page indicated were\nfound \" three words beginning with capitals\u2014namely M,\nS, and E,\" which initials were \" applicable to the com-\nmunicator herself and to friends and relations.\"\nAnother thing of rather frequent occurrence is the\ndescription of a name on a page by its initial and perhaps\nsecond letter and number of syllables. There is an\nexample in the case given above on pp. 339-340 where\n\" a funny name \" beginning with V like Vodka is men-\ntioned\u2014meaning apparently Voltaire. Or, again, on April\n24, 1918 (in the book-test quoted above, pp. 345-346) : ,\n' For particulars see Appendix D, p. 398.\n{k\nwas\n\f4\nLxxxi.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 357\nA word kept impressing itself on her, she couldn't sense\nits meaning, but she got the impression that the letters\nmight form a word such as Rosalie ... Or it was\nRosalene, or Rosalende. She couldn't get it quite rightly,\nbut the word she sensed seemed to occupy a prominent\nposition in the chapter what she was sensing. She's sure\nit must have been on p. 98 or very close.\nThe word Robespierre occurs on p. 100, and it will be\nremembered that this is a case where 98 should apparently\naave been 99.\nAll this leaves us in great bewilderment as to what is\nreally apprehended as well as to how it is apprehended.\nThat we should not understand the \" how \" is no doubt\nnatural, for knowledge of a passage in a closed book can\nbardly be obtained by means of any bodily senses such as\nwe are acquainted with, and it would therefore be very\ndifficult to explain to us what occurs even apart from any\ndifficulty in getting the explanation through.\nIt is true that communicators sometimes offer as a kind\nof explanation one involving in a way perception through\nthe bodily senses\u2014those of previous readers. They say it\nis much more difficult for them to get information from a\ncopy of a book which no one has read. Thus, when Mrs.\nKennedy on January 19, 1918, asked the communicator\n(her son) how he could sense what was in a book when it\nwas not in MS. but had become merely a matter of signs\nset up at a printer's office without thought as to meaning,\nthe reply was :\nEveryone who has read a book has left what you\nmight almost call a sort of aui'a. When reading the book\nthey have in a way psychometrized the book and left a\nthought. A book straight from the printers w'ould not be\nat all good, very difficult. It is something like a person\nwho has been in a room five hundred years ago, and has\nleft there an impression.\nAgain, at an A. W. V. sitting on March 1, 1918, Feda says :\nF. Mr. Arthur's good at sensing the outside of books. He\nthinks it's easier to sense outsides, because so many people\n\f358 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. '\n[part\nhave read outsides of books, and in a way imprinted the\nthoughts back on the books, registering their thoughts on\nthe books in the psychic ; almost reprinting the title in\npsychic letters. He's got a feeling neither he nor any\nother spirit could sense a book which had come straight\nfrom the printers and never been perused. It would make\na difference who had read the book. If he took a book\nwhich only one person had read, according to the mental\nconcentration of that person he would be able to get tests\nfrom that book. Like a psychic book. Like a medium\ngetting conditions through a ring or letters, but they\ncouldn't get the conditions unless they'd caught them from\nthe person. It's like haunting. There's no such thing as a\nspirit haunting a jjlace. It's a thought-form imprinted on\nether.\nYet again on April 3, 1918, M. R. H. had a discussion\nwith A. V. B. (through Feda) on the subject. The\nquestion of adding to the books from which book-tests\nmight be selected had been raised.\n^\n.\n1 . \/\u2022<(.,( r.(;i-;\n\u2022\nM. R. H. I could buy some new ones.\nF. No, she says she doesn't want that, 'cos if you\nbought 'em you would have to read 'em first,\nM. R. H. Why ? We've had tests from books that have never\nbeen read by either of us.\nF. She says some one had read them.\nM. R. H. No, in one case the book was fresh from the pub-\nlisher. ..\nF. , She says she wasn't aware of that.

Yes, she says that would do very well.\nThe communicator herself here tells us that this idea\n\u2014\nthat previous reading of a page by some one through their\nordinary senses facilitates the reading of it by the com-\nmunicator without the use of senses at all\u2014is only a\ntheory, and we cannot say that it is a theory which is\nwell supported by the facts. For there is no adequate\nevidence that an uncut book is more difficult to \" sense\n\"\nthan one which has been read. In several of the book-\ntests I have quoted the page referred to was uncut (see\npp. 294-296).\nIt is of course conceivable that an uncut page has been\nread by some one\u2014say the binder, or even by a person\nglancing through the book,^ but the probabilities are much\nagainst this. There is, moreover, no instance I think of\nthe communicator calling attention to the fact that a page\nreferred to was uncut. And the impressions, right or\nwrong, alleged to be derived from pages which prove to\nbe uncut are described with as much fulness and detail as\nothers. ' '\n'In one case (A. V. B., Oct. 26, 1918) in which a fair amount of\nsuccess was obtained, the page was in a group of uncut pages, and\nlso placed that it could not be read at all without cutting.\n\f360 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nThe communicator's account of what is on a closed page\nis generally merely descriptive and does not give anj^ hint\nof the mode of perception. There are, however, cases i\nwhere he tries to describe his impression in terms of |\ndifferent senses\u2014seeing, hearing, and feeling\u2014and others j\nwhere what is said seems to imply sensory impressions.\n|\nBy \" feeling,\" it is true, a general impression is often all |\nthat is meant. But this is not always so. We get both\nj\nmeanings in remarks made at an A. W. V. sitting on\nNovember 23, 1918. Feda says : i\nThere's something French about this book, he got a i\nfeeling of something French. French, yes, that's right. He \\\ngot that feeling not about this page, but several times as j\n\\\nhe was feehng about. !\n!\n[As a matter of fact there was nothing French about the j\nbook in question, but there may have been confusion, as. |\n)\nthe statement would have been true about a book referred i\nto just before.] \\\n.. .\nI\nWe have the same use of feel (\"he wented to feel that \\'\\\nsecond book \") in a case quoted above (p. 287). ^\nThe following is an example of hearing being referred to. i|\nIt was on July 17, 1918, in a very nearly successful '\\\nattempt by A. V. B. to get at the liame of the book i\nAmitie Amoureuse, which was being experimented with ;\n(see above, p. 300). Asked what was the first letter of the I\nword, Feda repeats the question and continues, \" It would \\\nbe A. Yes, it sounded to her like A, the pronunciation i\nis A. She can't always see a letter but it sounded hke i\nthat.\" Another good example of description in terms of\nsound occurred in Mr. Drayton Thomas's sitting of March\n28, 1918, when it was said :\n\" A word is on that page which i\nhas the sound of OSAPH ; it is not a common word.\"\n|\nMr. Thomas thinks the word \" philosophy \" was referred to.\nWe may note that in the experiment with Greek books\nreferred to above (p. 304) if \" Boris, Borisee \" was really\nan attempt at \" Parisinus,\" the impression not quite\ncaught by some one\u2014the communicator apparently\u2014was ;\nan oral one. Instances might be multiplied from cases\nwhich turned out failures, as when Feda remarked on\ni\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 361\nSeptember 20, 1918 :\n\" On this page there's a name or\nword what sounded to him [A. W. V.] like Bar-ba-does.\nThat isn't anything he wanted to give as a message, but\nas he sensed it he thought he might as well give it.\"\nI understand that no such word was found, so we are\nleft in doubt whether the impression was derived from\n\" sensing \" or imagination, and can therefore base on\nit no conclusions as to the mode of \" sensing.\"\nVisual impressions seem to be implied in such references\nto initials as are quoted above (p. 356), and on the same\npage the sentence about what \" seems hke a date because\nthere is a big number.\" See also on p. 320 above :\n\" a\nnumber or a word in different characters to the usual. If\nit's a number it's more than one figure, it must be two\nor more characters to it, because if it were not hke that\nit wouldn't look like a word.\" And again on the next\npage : \"he thinks that he's got the first two syllables\nof the word right if not the rest \" ;\nthis last, however,\nmight have been an auditory impression.\nThe following remark of Feda's about A. W. V. (on\nOctober 19, 1918) distinctly affirms a visual impression :\nWhen he was sensing these books he got for the time\nbeing a peculiar clarity of vision which enabled him to see\neven words on the pages, and he finds this morning he can\neven reproduce them to a certain extent.\nAs a comment on this, however, it is interesting to note\nthat it is an introduction to a statement that he had seen\nthe word \" Caelebs \" (this was spelt by Feda letter by\nletter) which he had certainly not seen on the page in\nquestion, though he may have been aware that the page\nwas about a bachelor. If so, the visual impression would\nseem to have arisen out of the idea. The whole incident\nis of some interest in this connexion, and I have quoted\nit in Appendix D.\nIt would seem that impressions of pictures which are\ndescribed critically or with detail must be visual. There\nare not many such descriptions of pictures said to be in\nbooks, but one case was given above (p. 340-1) where a\npicture of a lady out of drawing is mentioned. Another\n\f362 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\noccurred on September 19, 1917, also at an A. V. B. sitting.\nFeda says :\nOh ! she says there's a book near the special one that\nwhen you open it has got a picture in it, a picture of\nrather a simpering female in rather an exaggerated and\nout of date dress, with the figure all squeezed into\nunnatural lines.\n[Eight books from the selected book, which was The Old\nCuriosity Shoj) (see pp. 289-292), was one called Madame, by\nJulia Cartwright, the frontispiece of which is the portrait\nof Princess Henrietta of England in the exaggeratedly\ntight-laced costume of the period, and having an un-\ndeniably simpering expression.]\nA picture was described with still more detail on\nDecember 8, 1918 (see above, p. 306), but in this case\nthere was no such picture in any of the books, and the\nvisual impression, if really arising out of the book-tests,\nmust have been the result of association of ideas\u2014the\nbook specified suggesting the idea of (say) Demosthenes,\nand this idea suggesting a picture of an ancient Greek\nwhich had probably been seen by the medium. If this\nwas so, the phenomenon may be classed with the\nimpression just referred to of having seen the word\nCaelebs upon the page. Another erroneous impression\nabout the Greek books seems to have assumed a more or\nless visual form in the description of an Eastern Country\nquoted above, p. 348, as suggesting guessing.\nIn the following case (A. V. B. book-tests of July 17,\n1918, points in which have already been referred to on pp.\n300 and 360), a visual impression in some respects analogous\nto the last mentioned seems to have been experienced by\nthe communicator. It was not I think visualized by Feda,\nthough this is not certain, as the account is confused ; for\nFeda begins as if she were being shown something and\ngoes on as if she were trying to repeat a verbal descrip-\ntion :\nF, {s.v. Wait a minute, what are you showing Feda ?) Feda\nmust give it to you just as she says, or Feda might get it\n^vrong.

A word she felt written sounds like\nT.H.Y.R.O.N.E.\nNow there was no such description in the book, nor was\nthere any picture. But the book opens with the intro-\nduction to each other of the hero and heroine at a soiree\nin Paris,-^ and the scene described\u2014omitting the words\nstreet and road\u2014might be suggested by the idea of a\nsoiree, while the words beginning with S might be attempts\nat soiree or salon or both. This is of course highly con-\njectural. No word hke T.H.Y.R.O.N.E. was found.\nA. V. B. affirms on December 28, 1918, that she cannot\nalways distinguish between pictures and verbal descrip-\ntions. As neither was found in this particular instance, it\nis doubtful how much importance can be attached to her\nstatement, which may be mere padding, but I think the\npassage is worth quoting as possibly containing at least\nelements of truth.\nF.

Yes, exactly, but when she gives it as being on a\ncertain page\n\u2014\nU. V. T. I understand, what she means is when she says \" a\nquarter of the v\/ay down a certain page \" then it's\na message in words.\nF. It is not very likely to mean a picture unless\u2014\nsuppose she'd got the word \" bird \" near the top\nof the page, and\u2014you do mean this, Ladye ?\nYes, she says seriously, and in the picture there\nhappened to be a bird near the top of the page,\nthen even if she knew it, she might not be able\nto tell you through Feda that she knew it. She\nsays :\n\" Of course I'm exaggerating, but it's quite\npossible !\n\" . . . She says you do understand that,\ndon't you ?\nU. V. T. It interests me and I understand it quite well.\nF. She saj's :\n\" You do understand too that I'm not\nalways able to explain even when I know it ?\n\"\n. . . She says it's Feda that's the difficulty.\nU. V. T. Very likely.\nF. I don't think I am, it's this (touches Mrs. Leonard's\nbody).\nIt might perhaps be worth while trying with a sheK\nfull of illustrated books whether there is any indication\nthat pictures are more easily \" sensed \" than letterpress.\nI think it may be instructive, in connexion with the\nquestion of the degree or mode of perception in book-\ntests, to examine how they are presented to Feda\u2014dis-\ntinguishing, that is, between Feda and the communicator.\nWhatever Feda and the communicator may be, they are\n1 I have not got the record of this experience of Mr. Drayton Thomas.\nI quote it here because Mr. Thomas sometimes talks over with Feda\nthe results of his book-tests, so that it is possible that the idea of the\ninterehangeability of descriptions and pictures may have come from\nhim.\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 365\ndramatically and I think in their own consciousnesses\n\u2014\ncertainly in Feda's\u2014quite distinct personalities throughout\nthe sitting. To Feda the communicator is an individual,\nto a great extent visible, whose sensations and other\nexperiences she does not necessarily share, and who com-\nmunicates with her in various ways. One way is by\nlanguage heard and which Feda can sometimes repeat\nverbatim. (I say heard because that is how Feda ex-\npresses it, not as meaning that it is heard with Mrs.\nLeonard's bodily ears of course.) Another way is by\nsymbolic gestures. \" She nods her head \" (A. V. B.,\nMarch 20, 1918). \" He's smiling \" (see above, p. 321).\n\" Ladye is going like this (Feda draws herself up and\nlooks stern) \" (A. V. B., October 23, 1918). \" It seems to\nFeda to be halfway through the book, because Ladye is\nshowing Feda a book and putting her finger in to show\nFeda the place \" (A. V. B., January 9, 1918). \" A book\nwhoso title makes him feel horribly cold. He's pretending\nto shiver. ... It doesn't really Mrs. Nellie \" (A. W. V.,\nJune 11, 1918). \"What you doing, Ladye? I'll show\nyou what she's doing. She puts down her hand and she's\npretending to pick up the carpet \" [apparently to suggest\na Persian carpet]. (A. V. B., November 5, 1918.) \" He's\npretending to show me a long, long pole in his hand\n\"\n(see above, p. 288). Similar instances might be multiplied\nalmost indefinitely.\nAnother visual method is for the communicator to write\nor \" build up \" the objects, e.g. numbers, which he wishes\nFeda to understand. Examples of this have been given\nabove, p. 351. Feda seems, sometimes at least, to think\nthis method clearer than the oral method. \" If she shows\nFeda the page [meaning apparently its number] it makes\nit much more clear to Feda. Twenty and a five,\u201425\n\"\n(A. V. B., January 16, 1918). I think, however, that this\nmethod may possibly be responsible for the doubt Feda\nis liable to express as to the order of the numerals. If\nthey are \" built up \" separately it may not be obvious\nhow they should be arranged. In the following case it is\nperhaps doubtful whether what was shown to Feda was\nsymbolic action of the communicator, or a vision of a\n\f366 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nshelf. \" The books doesn't all match there. He's showing\ndifferent shapes and sizes \" (Mr. Kittermaster, January 25,\n1918). But that the communicator does at times convey\nto Feda what he wants her to explain to the sitter by\nmeans of visions\u2014and often very vivid ones\u2014of the room\nand shelves in which selected books are, of the outsides of\nbooks, and of other objects in the room, no one who has\nread this paper thus far will doubt. Good instances are\nfound in the description of the picture \" Le Canape Bleu\n\"\n(p. 249 et seq.), of the statuette, etc., quoted in Appendix B,\nand in other cases.\nA very conspicuous instance of this kind of vision of\nexternal objects being given to Feda occvirred\u2014-not in\nconnexion with book-tests, which had not begun then\u2014on\nOctober 30, 1916, and is described in the paper by Miss\nRadclyffe Hall and Lady Troubridge lately published\n{Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XXX., p. 459). Feda says :\n\" She's showing Feda a square room, it's a sitting room,\"\nand a remarkable description of Lady Troubridge's drawing-\nroom followed, given by Feda as though seeing it.\nThe following is a rather quaint way of describing a\nsimilar vision. At an A. W. V. sitting, January 14, 1918,\nFeda says :\n\" He's picked the same shelf as he choosed\nlast time, and now he's trying to show Feda a glumpse\u2014\nno a glimpse of that place, like through a hole.\" A\ndescription of a bookcase and part of the room at Mrs.\nSalter's house follows, which appears to have been fairly\ncorrect.\nSometimes Feda seems to be led into the room of\nwhich she is to have a vision. The following case is\nprobably an example of a vision of this kind, and it also\nillustrates disagreement between the communicator and\nFeda as to the interpretation of what is seen. It hap-\npened on January 2, 1918, at an A. V. B. sitting. Feda\nsays :\nIs the shelf in a part of the room nearest the window\nLadye ? Now are you sure Ladye ? because Feda thought\nit was near the fireplace. Yes, it is the fire-place too.\nLadye may think it's near the window because as you\ncome into the room you walk towards the fire-place when\n\f(\nLxxxi.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 367\nyou want to walk to the window. Feda thinks that Ladye\nis mistaldng the window for the fireplace. Oh yes ;\nLadj^e\nsays Feda is more right than she is, the books are near\nthe fire-place. It seems to Feda there is one shelf about\nthis high. (Indicates with her hand a certain height.) Is\nthat about 4 feet high ?\n[The books were near the fire-place.]\nThe following from A. V. B., December 8, 1918, is an\nexample of Feda being apparentlj^ shown things from\ndifferent points of view :\nF. Wait a minute Ladye. Now show me the room. Furni-\nture like a sitting-room. It's a bit more oblong Ladye\nthinks, but it looks about square to Feda what she's\nshowing does. But she thinks that it's actually oblong\nrather. Wait a minute. Coming in at the door you gets\nthe feeling of across the room, but she keeps taking me to\na corner, not in the middle of a wall ; and round,\nsomething round in the corner. I don't think it's right\nin the corner, but it's close to the corner, but she's\npointing to the corner and saying \" books.\"\n[The description, as far as it goes, is fairly correct.]\nThese visions of Feda's vary no doubt in vividness, and\nit may be that it is when a portion of the vision is very\nvivid that Feda speaks of it as \" flashed up \" before her.\nThis happened, it will be remembered, in the case of the\n\" Canape Bleu \" picture (see above, p. 249). The expression\nis used again at an A. V. B. sitting on July 3, 1918.\nAfter indicating clearly from the communicator's descrip-\ntion the shelves meant and the place of the book, Feda\ncontinues :\nF. IVIi's. Twonnie, do you haj)pen to know if at the\ncorner to the left of one of the shelves there's a\nrather big book with some very much smaller\nbooks next to it ?\nM. R. H. I can't remember.\nF. She's showed it to Feda in a flash, one book looked\n.;- . so thin that you'd hardly call it a book at all,\nand one of the books she showed Feda in a flash\n\f368 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc. [part\nhas a green cover. Feda has to be very careful\nover colours, 'cos she (touches medium) don't\nknow blues and greens apart.\nOn this M. R. H. comments :\nIn the left-hand corner of the second shelf from the\nbottom there was found to be an ordinary sized novel, of\naverage height* and thickness, and next to it was a very\nsmall book, much smaller than the novel, next to this\nagain was a book so thin as to be scarcely more than a\npamphlet; then followed six books all considerably under\nthe average size of those in the case, and two of these\nbooks have green covers. Upon all the other shelves of\nthe case, or, at least, at the corners of all the other\nshelves, the books are more or less uniform in size.\"\nIt is to be observed that the test-book is not included in\nthis clearly seen group. The test-book was stated to be\nin the same case but in the fourth shelf from the bottom,\nthe first book to the left. It proved a fairly successful\nbook-test, but as there was some confusion about what\npage was meant, and as the \" message \" related to private\naffairs, I have not quoted it.\nThe communicator apparently sometimes uses an induced\nvision of an absent person to suggest him to Feda ; thus\non January 30, 1918, an A. V. B. sitting, Feda says :\nWhat is she bringing him in for . . . the gentleman what\ncomes to speak to Feda ; she says you know him ; he's\nbeen twice here. She's showing him to Feda. Feda knows\nv\/hat he looks like.\n[What is obviously a description of Mr. Gerald Balfour\nfollows, and a reference to the letter G.^]\nFeda sometimes has vivid visions which do not appar-\nently represent anything real. Thus, on February 16, 1918,\nat a sitting of Mrs. Beadon's, Feda said :\nPage 82, about halfway down, a message about your\nprogress together.\n^ Mr. Balfoiir had had two sittings with Mrs. Leonard a few days\nbefore this.\n\fLxxxi.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 369\nFeda doesn't know if this has anything to do \u2022with the\nmessage, but he is showing Feda a very vivid, distinct\npicture of you and him with faces lifted up and light\nstreaming on them. You are going up hill, with feet in\nthe dark, hand in hand, looking to the light. Feda thinks\nit may have to do with the message.\n[Mrs. Beadon notes : \"I can find nothing of this on p. 82.\"]\nYet another way in which the communicator expresses\nhis meaning is by imparting to Feda motor impulses\n\u2014\ncausing her to move in particular ways. At the A. V. B.\nsitting referred to above (December 8, 1918) :\n(Feda points to the top of a small oak cabinet to\nthe right of the medium) . . .\nU. V. T. Are you trying to get the height of the shelf from\nwhich she has selected books ?\nr. I thought you were Ladye ! She shakes her head,\nyet she has an object in saying that height. It's\na line to go from, she says it was rather im-\nportant she thought to give that height. What\nare you trying to do Ladye 1 Don't know what\nA^ou wants me to do. She keeps on moving my\nhand like that (Feda raises her hand to about the\ntop of the medium's cabinet, then makes a gesture\nof patting a horizontal surface) ... I think by\nm.aking me move my hand, she wants to make\nme know that that's the top of the thing.\nOr, again, on December 22, 1918 :\nF. Look, as you goes into the room they's there. (Feda now\npoints in front of her as though the books vt-ould be\nopposite the entrance of the room.) She's guiding my\nhand.\nI think it probable that when Feda draws figures or\nletters in the air for sitters to interpret, as often happens,\nshe is sometimes acting under motor impulse, not\napprehending what is meant herself until she has made the\nmovement.\n\f370 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nThere is a suggestion that Feda's assumption of the\nattitude of the figure in \" Le Canape Bleu \" picture is at\nleast partly an automatic movement, not pure imitation^\nfor when asked whether she can see what the figure is\nlying or sitting on, she replies, \" It's not lying, it's sitting,,\nbecause Ladye can make Feda do it on this chair \" (see\nabove, p. 250).\nI am inclined to regard it as of some significance that\namong these modes of communication between the com-\nmunicator and Feda, the one that produces the most\nvivid impression\u2014a vision of the object to be described,\nsuch as Feda had of \" Le Canape Bleu \" picture \u2014is never\nused for conveying the idea of the inside of a closed\nbook. Indeed, Feda hardly ever (I will deal with possible\nexceptions presently) represents herself as seeing the page\nor part of it. Closed books remain closed books to her^\nand she only repeats to the sitter what the communicator\nexplains to her by word or sign. Is this because the\ncommunicator's own impression is not of the vivid order\nrequired to make Feda see a vision ? Certainly in a\ngeneral way it seems to be rather vague and fragmentary.\nThe reader will prol)ably here object that in the case of\nthe picture of a child lying down (see pp. 283 ei seq.),.\nwhich I quoted among instances of book-tests described\nbeforehand with verbal accuracy, Feda did have a vision\nof it similar in kind to the one she had of \" Le Canape\nBleu,\" though perhaps less complete. This is true, but\nthen the picture was not inside a book. It was on the\ncover, and though not visible without moving the books,\nits position may well have been known to some one. In\nfact it seems very likely that a binding so unusual\namong the books in question was specially noticed by the\nhousemaid jvho had recently rearranged them, if not by\nothers. I am, in fact, disposed to think that the unusual\nfeature of Feda's having a vision of this picture is an\nargument for its not having been \" sensed \" by the com-\nmunicator in the same way as a book-test proper, and\nfor the knowledge of it not having been obtained purely\nby clairvoyance.\n\fLXXXI.] An Examination of Book-Tests. 371\nAn incident occurred, however, at an A. V. B. sitting\non December 18, 1918, which suggests a kind of vision\nby Feda. The record is as follows :\nF. She's not sure whether this is on page 6 or on the pre-\nceding page, but she just wants to describe something.\nShe's showing it to Feda. There's the page. (Here Feda\nindicates the page of a book by gesture.) I could draw\nit I think. (M. R. H. . . . hands the block and a pencil\nto Feda. Feda proceeds to draw three long wavy lines\nindicative of writing, she then makes a scratchy mark on\nthe paper remarking there's a star.\" She then draws\nfour short wavy lines, remarking \" these is short lines.\"\nShe then draws a circle and says that A. V. B. is not\nquite certain regarding the position of that circle, but that\nshe thinks it comes about there on the page. Feda then\ndraws four more long lines ;\nsaying, \" these is long again,\nthat's how the page is.\")\nWhether Feda here conceived herself as copying from a\nmodel of the page, or as drawing from the communicator's\ndirections, is not clear, but I think the latter. It is not\nimportant, however, as the drawing \" does not seem to\nreproduce anything on the pages \" indicated.\nFeda does not take pains to distinguish between de-\nscribing her own direct impressions and repeating what the\ncommumcator tells her, and some ambiguities occur. But\nif the records of the book-tests are read carefully, it will,\nI think, generally appear clearly that the latter is meant.\nIn a few cases, however, the expressions used may perhaps\nbe more naturally interpreted as meaning that Feda\nherself saw the page. The most distinct instances of this\nwhich I have noticed were two that occurred at A. V. B.\nsittings on November 22 and 28, 1917, respectively. On\nNovember 22 Feda said :\nOn the page which is called 75,\u2014Feda can see more\nclearly to-daj^\u2014near the top, there is a message that refers\nto tlie general state of affairs now, but in a way as\naffecting j^ou, Mrs. Twonnie. Wait a minute, there is\nsomething more, a word, something important that has to\ndo with this book, is a word like Roscommon, that's the\n\f372 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nnearest Feda can get to it, and there's an important word\non the title-page beginning with a P. This is a kind of\nfeeler, so that she [the communicator] can get the feeling\nof that [book] case more.\nIf the seeing more clearlj^ hj Feda refers to her seeing\nthe figures 75 \" built up \" for her, and if when she says\nthat Roscommon is the nearest she can get to the word,\nshe means it is the best approximation she can get to the\ncommunicator's pronunciation of the word\u2014and such inter-\npretations are not, I think, strained \u2014we are left with\nnothing here about Feda \" sensing \" the page herself.\nAgain on November 28, 1917, Feda says :\nThere's a funny sounding word like Adiosis, Adiosis,\nthat word's in the beginning of the book on the title-pages.\nThen she says Assiosis, no, that's not quite it, but it\nbegins with an A, and it seems to Feda to suggest that\nsound, and it feels to Feda like a three-syllabled word,\nnot a little word.\nHere everything turns on whether \" feels to Feda \" can\napply to her apprehension of what the communicator is\nsaying, and it seems to apply just as well to that as to\na more direct apprehension of the page in the closed book.\nFeda's exact meaning is, however, of less consequence\nthan it might have been, because these particular tests\nwere both complete failures. In the first there was no\nappropriate message on p. 75, no word at all like Roscommon\ncould be found, nor was there a word on the title-page\nbeginning with P. And on November 28 no word like\nAdiosis or Assiosis was found in the beginning of the book,\nand the word Anco7ia in italics in the preface is the only\napproach to Feda's three-sjdlabled word beginning with A,\nand that certainly does not sound like Assiosis. If, there-\nfore, Feda on these occasions did have any kind of direct\nimpressions, there is no reason to think they were impressions\nof real pages.\nOne fact must be noticed in connexion with Feda's\nshare in the book-tests. There were three occasions when\n\fLXXXI.J An Examination of Book-Tests. 373\nthe usual procedure was changed\u2014or at least the dramatic\nmise-en-scene\u2014and Feda represents herself as helping to\nselect the book-tests. The three occasions were at A. V. B.\nsittings, in each case following shortly after a sitting which\nDr. T. W. Mitchell had had with Mrs. Leonard, Lady\nTroubridge being present as note-taker. In each case Feda\nand A. V. B. profess to have gone together to Dr. Mit-\nchell's house, where neither Mrs. Leonard nor the sitters\nhad been, to select a book-test for him. The first occa-\nsion was on May 9, 1918. At the beginning of the\nsitting Feda says :\nLadye's here . . . Mrs. Twonnie it's about a book test,\nbut the book test isn't for you, only as she helped to do\nit. She and Feda did it, only she did the best part of\nit\u2014it's for Mrs. Una's Doctor man what corned yesterday.\nShe only did it last night.\nThe second occasion was on July 6, 1918. Feda begins :\nShe's going to give a book test for the doctor first.\nFeda couldn't get it last time. Feda don't know if he\nstopped Feda last time. Feda had a feeling as if he was\ntrying to think of some 'ticular books. Feda oughtn't to\nhave told him she was going to get one.^ Feda has been\nand got one now, and Ladye was there too, so Feda'U\nask her to help to remember.\nA Uttle further on Feda remarks apropos to the book-\ntest proper, \" Ladye you help Feda to get that exactly\nas it was said before.\" And again, \" Sometimes she\n[A. V. B.] notices things what Feda doesn't.\"\nThe third occasion was on October 12, 1918. Feda\nsays :\nNow wait a minute\n\u2014\n{s.v. Ladye you remind Feda, 'cos\nFeda's been there too) [a description of the room, etc.,\nfollows]. We got the books on the third shelf up, . . .\n1 All this refers to a sitting of which I have not seen the record,-\nDr. Mitchell notes, \" When Feda said [at the previous sitting] she was\ngoing to give me another test my mind reverted at once to a particular\nshelf where I wanted her to make the test because the .books there\nwere not psycho-therai^eutic books.\"\n\f374 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\non this third shelf we took the sixth book . . . The page\nwas a one and a nine, one nine, nineteen, and it was the\ntop part of the page. You know Ladj^e and Feda founded\nit, but it's from the gentleman who was speaking to him\nat the sitting, and it's a message from him to the doctor\nman {s.v. Wait a minute. This is where you'll have to\nhelp Feda, Ladye). Oh it's a message from that gentleman\nto the doctor, about his work, not the spirit's work, but\nthe doctor's . . . but Ladye says it might apply not only\nto his work, but to his general conditions as well.\nFrom this point Feda drops out as a co-percipient, and\nquotes and paraphrases what A. V. B. says in the usual\nstyle. She comes in again possibly at the end in the\nword \" we \" in a cjuoted sentence :\n\" She [A. V. B.]\nsays '\nI suppose he does know that we get the idea, the\nthought, more than the written word, doesn't he ?\n'\n\"\nI may remark that in these three attempts at book-\ntests, though there are some things quite wrong, there are\ninteresting points\n\u2014\ne.g. a description of a peculiar arrange-\nment of book shelves in a room quite unknown to medium\nand sitters and away from London. Again a direction to\n\"look on the outside of a book within a span of the test\nbook, and you'll find something that will distinctly remind\nhim of the gentleman who spoke to him the other day.\"\nThe name of the purporting communicator referred to was\nGrainger Stewart, and twelve inches from the test book\nwas a book by J. A. Stewart. But the book-tests proper\nwere not very satisfactory.\nIf it be asked what was the meaning of this peculiar\nintervention of Feda's in these particular book-tests, I can\nonly suggest dramatic appropriateness. As they were given\nat sittings of M. R. H. and U. V. T., at which A. V. B.\nwas the habitual communicator, she had to appear, but\nshe had no connexion with Dr. Mitchell and was not\nsupposed to know him. On the other hand, Feda had\nmade great friends with him, and may have been supposed\nto supply the necessary connexion. This suggestion is of\ncourse on. the sceptical side, and is moreover mere con-\njecture. Others may think of a better explanation.\n\fjLXXXI.] A)i Examination of Book-Tests. 375\n\u00a7 10.\nConclusion.\nThis concludes my examination of the book-tests sub-\nmitted to me, and it only remains to sum up\u2014a thing\nI find it particularly hard to do, for the evidence is so\nmixed.\nIt is impossible to doubt, I think, that Mrs. Leonard in\ntrance has supernormal powers. Evidence given in this\npaper alone goes far to prove telepathy, at least from\nthe living, and in one case (Mrs. Talbot's, see above,\n\u00a7 2) apparently from the dead. But is there sufficient\nevidence to convince us of the possibility of clair-\nvoyance\u2014the acquisition of knowledge of physical things\notherwise than through the bodily senses of some one.\nThere are cases that look remarkably like it, though\nnever so distinct and unmistakable and free from error\nas we could wish. But they are mixed up with cases\nsuggesting no knowledge\u2014normal or supernormal at all.\nThese apparent^ false cases are uttered with the same\nkind of confidence, the same appearance of interest, the\nsame amount of detail as the apparently genuine ones, and\nthere is no means of distinguishing false from true till\nverification is attempted. When we do verify we find\n\u2022every shade of success or failure, from undeniable suc-\ncesses, through those which we hardly know whether to\ncount as exhibiting any success at all, to undeniable\nfailures.\nThis mixture of true and false need not by itself\nsurprise us. We know that mth automatists, and\nespecially those who sit to order like Mrs. Leonard, there\nis much in automatic speaking or writing that we may\ncall mere dream stuff, even where there is evidence that\nsome things said have a supernormal origin. Book-tests\nliaving become for the time being almost part of the\nroutine of communication with certain sitters, Feda may\nreel them oft' more or less mechanically, and without\nherself knowing whence the impulse comes and whether\n\"the alleged inspiration is real or imaginary. And there\n\f376 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nwill be degrees of completeness in success, whether the\nsuccess is due to clairvoyance or to chance.\nA more serious obstacle perhaps to accepting clair-\nvoyance as the explanation of book-tests lies in the\ndifficulties and bewildering inconsistencies in what is said\nabout the mode of identifying the page, and about the\nkind of thing\u2014forms or ideas\u2014perceived on it. On\naccount of its want of consistency most of such talk has\nto be swept aside as very probably nonsense, and if we\naccept clairvoyance as a fact v\/e must admit that so far-\nwe know nothing at all as to what it consists in. We\nchiefly know that, at least in Mrs. Leonard's case, it\ngenerally seems indistinct and vague.\nOur acceptance or not of clairvoyance as a fact must\nthen depend solely on our judgment whether the successes\nrecorded are more than we can suppose chance to have\nproduced in a kind of case in which the chances are very\nhard to estimate, and in a matter which is at present\ndisconnected with all our established knowledge and there-\nfore very hard to believe.\nOn the whole, I think the evidence before us does\nconstitute a reasonable prima facie case for belief, and that\nin future we must reckon with clairvoyance as a possi-\nbility to be taken account of in interpreting mysterious\nhappenings.^\n^ Of course in this paper I have not by any means quoted every\nincident which may be regarded as affording some evidence of clair-\nvoyance, but I have quoted those which seem to me to have most\nweight. It may interest the reader to know which half dozen of the\ncases in this collection appear to me the most convincing\u2014those which\nit is least possible to exj)lain by chance. Different people would prob-\nably judge differently, and one might oneself feel somewhat differently\nat different times, but I think I should select the following six cases,\nwhich I do not put in order of merit.\n[a) The first case mentioned in the paper, where a passage in a\nbook is connected with an ornament worn (A. V. B., Sept. 12, 1917 ;\nsee above, p. 248). (b) The message to Mrs. Beadon about her husband's\nburial (Sept. 29, 1917 ; see above, p. 280). (c) A. V. B.'s second message\nabout lights (Aug. 24, 1918 ; see above, p. 273). (d) A. W. V.'s state-\nment about a long pole (Jan. 4, 1919 ; see above, p. 286). (e) Mariana\nin the South (A. W. V., April 11, 1918; see above, p. 297). (\/)\nA. W. V. about the family tree, etc. \u2014the book-tests of this day as-\na whole (Feb. 28, 1918 ; see above, p. 341).\n\fLXXXI.] All Examination of Book-Tests. 377\nGranting, then, that pure clairvoyance can sometimes be\nexercised, I think the present records suggest a thing\nwhich may be worth keeping in mind in future experi-\nments, namely, that telepathy and clairvoyance are prob-\nably in some way closely connected. Telepathic clair-\nvoyance\u2014perception of external things not known to any\none present but known to some one somewhere ^\n\u2014probably\nmerges into pure clairvoyance, while the line between more\nordinary telepathy and telepathic clairvoyance is not a\nwell-marked one. I think it is likely that the processes\nnot only merge into each other but that they may\nsometimes operate simultaneously. The idea is not of\ncourse a new one. Professor Charles Richet in the\npaper describing his experiments in clairvoyance to which\nI referred the reader in a footnote on p. 247 maintains\nthat \" Cette telepathie n'est qu'un cas particulier d'un fait\nbien plus general\u2014la faculte de connaissance des somnam-\nbules.\" And Myers in Human Personality frequently points\nout that Telsesthesia [i.e. clairvoyance] merges into tele-\npathy\u2014that the distinction between them \" cannot be made\nfundamental.\" (See e.g. Vol. I. p. 136.) But my object in\nspeaking of it is not theoretical but practical. By keeping in\nmind the probable connexion of telepathy and clairvoyance we\nmay get a helpful clue in experimenting. If, for instance,\ntelepath}^ of some sort comes into operation in what we\nmay call the approaches to the book-test proper\u2014in the\nfinding of the volume and its surroundings\u2014this may\nfacilitate the clairvoyant perception of the inside of the\nbook which sometimes follows. The perception of the\nsurroundings may itself be partly telepathic and partly\nclairvoyant.\nIt is perhaps doubtful whether book-tests with Mrs.\nLeonard in the form dealt with in this paper should be\ncontinued indefinitely, as their continuance might lead to\nstaleness, and might increase a habit of producing auto-\n1 For Telepathic Clairvoyance see a collection of cases and a discussion\nby myself entitled \" On the Evidence for Clairvoyance \" in Proceedings\nS.P.R., Vol. VII., pp. 30-99 and 3.56-369.

But if any new form of\nexperiment to demonstrate clairvoyance is designed, it\nwould i\nbe well to keep in mind that an avenue admitting\nof telepathy with the sitter may be a useful approach to\nthe test proper.\nThat further experiments should be tried with Mrs.\nLeonard and others is much to be desired, for more\nevidence is greatly needed. But if pure clairvoyance is a\nreahty, and if we are on the verge of estabhshing this\nscientifically as the experiments before us seem to show\nthe importance of the investigation carmot l^e overrated.\n\fAPPENDIX A.\nA Note on Chance in Book-Tests.\nI SAID on p. 244 that it would be an error to suppose\nthat on abnost any page of any book something that may\npass as a message may be found, and there is of course\nstill less probability that when indications, even vague\nones, of the nature of the message are given, the message\nj\nwhen found will conform to them. As a test of this\nI tried the following experiment. I selected almost at\nrandom from the book-tests before us a promise of a\n\" message with something quite definite and objective\nin it\u2014meaning by objective something that has nothing\nspecially to do with the particular sitter or the sitter's\nrelation to the communicator. The one selected was from\nthe second book-test received by M. R. H. and U. V. T.,\nand was the first of their book-tests answering to the\nrequired conditions. It occurred in their sitting of August\n.5, 1917, and ran as follows :\nF. There's another book, it's the seventh book on the same\nshelf [as on the preceding occasion] and she's speaking of\npage 19. She says that should contain a message too.\nWait a minute. {s.v. A message about what, Ladye ?)\nShe says that it has some bearing on what is called\ndeath. Ladye thinks it is a little bit stupid, but she\nwants you to look.\n(I may remark in passing, though it is irrelevant to my\n\u2022experiment, that the test can only be regarded as a\npartial success. The book in question proved to be a\nvolume of poems by D. G. Rossetti, and p. 19 is part of\na poem called \" A Last Confession \" and purports to be\na death-bed confession to a priest. Such a confession,\nimplying of course the idea of death, may be said to have\n.379\n\f380 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nsome bearing upon death ; but there is nothing specifically\nabout death on p. 19.)\nReturning to my experiment. In a large room lined\nwith books I selected twelve at random without looking\nat them, defining them by their places in different shelves,\nand in each case I noted the page and the part of the\npage where the message was to be looked for. My list\ncame out as follows.

Appendix A. 383\nshould manifestly prescribe poison to all his patients\nwhereof they should immediately die.\" If, therefore, we\nallow ourselves to count the thirty-six pages obtained by\ntaking the selected pages and two adjacent ones, with-\nout regard to position in page, we do get a refer-\nence of some sort to death on ten pages, or rather\nover a quarter of the whole ; and we do get such\na reference in some part of three out of the twelve\nselected pages, though in one case only in the prescribed\npart of the page.\nThe probability of success in what I have called vague\nmessages is harder to judge of because it is more difficult\nto eliminate the subjective element. For instance, in\ndescriptions so vague as : \"A message straight from our\nboy to us \" (promised to a sitter in September, 1917) ;\nor \"A sort of message for you ; he says it isn't\nthe words he would choose, but he thinks you will know \"\n(received by another sitter, November 29, 1917) ; or\n\" These few words he wants you to take as a message \"\n(received by a third sitter on April 9, 1918) ; it is\nclear that the passage indicated might prove to have an\nappropriateness obvious to the sitter, though undiscoverable\nby an outsider ignorant of the circumstances.^ As an\nillustration of this, let us suppose that in Mrs. Beadon's case\n(p. 261 above) what she was told about the passage\nindicated had stopped after \" on p. 71 will be found a\nmessage from him to you. The message will not be as\nbeautiful as he would like to make it, but you will under-\nstand he wants to ma.ke the test as good as he can.\" If\nit had stopped here the test would have been considerably\nless good than it is as it stands, but the appropriateness\nof the passage indicated to the circumstances of the\ncommunicator's burial would still have made the\n\" message \" a striking one. But of these circumstances\nwe- should have known nothing had not the sitter informed\nus.

[part\ncumstances, we can only judge a book-test when some\nsort of indication of the sort of message we are to find\nis given.\nWe have such indications when a message of hope or\nencouragement without further definition is promised\u2014as\nin the following three cases :\n(1) \"A message from C\u2014 which he wants you to\nremember to cheer you up. It draws a comparison\nbetween the past and the present.\" (Prof, and Mrs. B.,\nDecember 2, 1917. See above, p. 354.)\n[Verification :\n\" The brave little soldier is gone into the\npresence of his Chief away in the Eternal City, . . . For\nthe boys who are Christ's faithful soldiers and servants\nhere shall continue that service in joyous, untiring youth\nin the great land beyond.\" This would be an appropriate\nmessage, but if it was the one intended the position of\nthe book was wrongly described.]\n(2) \"A message from him to you. He wants you to\nremember it when you feel sad about him. It is a\nmessage directly from him to you. He sometimes sees\ndepression in you. He sees it and wants to sweep it\naway. The message is meant to do that.\" (Mrs. John,\nMay 1918.)\n[Nothing appropriate was found in the book indicated.\nFeda afterwards said she had made a mistake as to where\nit was.]\n(3) \"A message to his mother, a kind of hope or\nencouragement.\" (Mrs. and Miss Morris, March 2, 1918.)\n[The book indicated was a Church Service, on the pre-\nscribed page of which is Isaiah Ixv., verses 19 to 25.\nThese verses are of an encouraging nature, though not\nstrictly appropriate.]\nIn another kind of vague message the characteristic\nindicated is definite and objective, but admits of very wide\ninterpretation. As instances we may take three cases\nreported by the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas :\n\fLxxxi. An Examination of Book-Tests. Appe^idix A. 385\n(4)\n\" Feda said that on page 53 is something about\nstriving : that it suggests endeavouring and holds out a\npromise through that endeavour.\" (September 6, 1917.)\n[Verification : On the page indicated begins St. Augus-\ntine's account of his conversion, and as Mr. Thomas says,\n\" While neither the word '\nstriving '\nnor '\nendeavouring\n'\nappears on the page, the story is one about inward strife\nand determined endeavouring of spirit to escape from an\nevil manner of life. A strife and an endeavour which\nended in triumphant success.\"]\n(5) At Mr. Thomas's next sitting Feda says :\n\" The\nmessage ... is about endeavour again, but under different\nconditions and aspects from last time.\" (September 29,\n1917.)\n[Verification : The sentence indicated was :\n\" Whatever\ndid you do to make her understand ?\n\" and related to the\nefforts of the heroine in a story to make a very deaf old\nwoman tell her the way home.]\n(6) The message, it is said, \" refers to an enviable frame\nof mind.\" (October 18, 1918.)\n[Verification : JVIr. Thomas takes a passage about our\nLord's passion to be the one referred to. In it occur\nthe words \" the love that sacrificed ; that gave up all\nfor love of all.\" i)\nIn the above six cases we have promises of messages on\nthree subjects, viz. : Hope and encouragement, endeavour,\nan enviable frame of mind. Should we be likely to find\nsuch messages on pages taken at random ? Could, for\ninstance, any of the twelve passages used in the above\nexperiment about death be regarded as appropriate ?\nThey will serve for passages selected at random as well\nas any others. I think the answer must be that no7ie of\nthem could be regarded as messages of hope and encour-\n^ Mr. Thomas arrives at this passage by counting the pages of the\npreface with those of the text though not numbered continuously.\nHe sometimes in counting tlie pages omits the preface even when it\nis numbered continuously with the text.\n\f386 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.

She then begins smooth-\ning down and making a gesture of pinching in the\nwaist with the two hands.) Mrs. Una, it's pointed\nlike that. (Here Feda indicates a tight waist and\na pointed bodice.) This isn't near the books.\nLady says there's something so silly about the\nlower part ; she says, \" I don't really think it's\nsilly myself, but there's something a little incon-\ngruous about it here.\" (Feda strokes her shins.)\nShe says it's when you balance it with the other\npart, there's something not quite right here.\n(Feda touches her shins and feet.)

V. T. The statuette\nmeasures lOf inches including the base. The dancer is\nrepresented in full ballet skirts, short, and sticking out\nupon the hips, the arms are akimbo, the fingers are spread\nout and are pointing forward, whereas the thumbs are\npointing in the opposite direction, and the waist of the\nfigure is represented as being tiny, and the bodice is\n\f390 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\npointed. There is every reason why A. V. B. should be\ninterested in this little statuette. She was very familiar\nwith it, as it stood in M. R. H.'s study Avhen she and\nA. V. B. were living together. Also M. R. H. bought the\nstatuette some time before she met U. V. T., and as U. V. T.\nis A. V. B.'s cousin, and a very old friend, it is natural\nthat A. V. B. should be interested in her artistic work. . . .\nFeda says that A. V. B. says there is something silly\nabout the lower part, something a little incongruous. . . .\nM. R. H. cannot remember that A. V. B. ever remarked\non the legs and feet of the statuette being faulty, during\nher lifetime ; but U. V. T. states that they are distinctly\nfaulty, and that she herself knew from the first that they\ndid not balance properly.\nWe need not compare further in words the description\ngiven by Feda with the statuette, as the photogravure\nwhich M. R. H. and U. V. T have kindly allowed us to\nappend will enable the reader to do this for himself We\nneed only add that the statement that \" it seems as if\nthis ought to belong to some time ago,\"' or at least to\npretend to do so, is correct for the role assumed by the\ndancer as represented. When the statuette was modelled\nMadame Genee assumed the cost'ume worn by her in an\nearly Victorian ballet. The further statement that the\nstatuette takes A. V. B. away from London is in U. V. T.'s\nopinion meant to refer to the fact that the statuette was\ncompleted and cast at Pau. The question arises whether\nthe statuette can have been known to Mrs. Leonard. At\nthe time it was produced, eleven or twelve years before\nthis sitting, it had a remarkable success, and over three\nhundred models in different materials were sold. Mrs.\nLeonard might therefore have come across a copy. On the\nother hand, it was never put upon the public market and\nwas therefore never on sale in shops. There has been\nnothing of recent date to bring it before the public afresh,\nand as it is signed (in an inconspicuous place) with\nU. V. T.'s maiden name, it seems unlikely that Mrs.\nLeonard would have connected it with her had she come\nacross it. It seems certain that Mrs. Leonard had not been\nat M. R. H.'s flat.\n\fMADA:\\IE ADELINE GENEE.\nThis photograph represents the original bronze statuette from which the\nplaster east referred to in tlie text was made.

Appendix B. 391\nThe mention of the ba^sket, which follows the description\nof the statuette, has a certain theoretic interest, for at the\nelate of the sitting there was no basket in the room.\nWhen M. R. H. is living in London, however, a small\nbasket belonging to her spaniel is frequently placed a few\nfeet away from the statuette and still nearer to the large\noak cupboard on which stands the cast of Verrocchio's\nfigure of the boy clasping a dolphin, referred to apparently\nhere and also on April 10, 1918.\nOn that day, April 10, another interesting though less\ndetailed description of an object in M. R. H.'s study was\ngiven\n:\nCrystal Ball and Tazza.\nF. There's something close to the drawers, by the\ndrawers, that reminds her of \" The day is Uke a\ncrystal cup.\" [A line from a poem by M. R. H.\nwhich had been repeated to Feda.] Don't alter\none word, it may only remind you of a part of\nthat saying ;\nyou may say there are tAvo parts of\nit, one supplies one part of it, and one another.\n. . . She says if you keep those words just as\nshe said them, there are two objects close to the\nthing with drawers, and they both supply two\nessential elements of that line.\n[Now there was in the room, but not close to the\nthing with drawers, a small Japanese Tazza com-\nposed of a dish standing on a tripod, the centre\nof the dish forming a species of cup, having an\nupstanding collar of bronze over an inch in depth.\nM. R. H. has always used this to stand a rock-\ncrystal ball in. She did this in A. V. B.'s life-\ntime, and has continued to do it ever since. We\nhave therefore the bronze Tazza standing for\n\" cup \" and the crystal ball for \" crystal \" in the\nline quoted. Feda continues :]\nJF. ... She says the area in which the things will be\nfound would be in a circle drawn close round the\ndrawers. [s.v. Wait a minute, a fish ! peoples\n\f392 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\ndon't have fishes in their rooms, they smells !)\nShe says there's something that suggests a fish in\nthat room.\nM. R. H. I place that.\nF. Feda don't like that, but Ladye says it's all right.\n{s.v. Not in rooms ! fish in a room !)\nM. R. H. I place it.\nF. (s.v. Fish 1 It is a fish, and day is like a crystal\ncup again.) Feda must say it like she says it.\nFeda mustn't alter it, must she ? She thinks it's\npretty complete as it is.\n[The tazza and crystal were not near the thing with\ndrawers\u2014that was a mistake. But they were on a\nshelf of a large piece of furniture on the top of\nwhich stood a reproduction of Verrocchio's \" Boy\nwith a Dolphin \" (referred to also later on October\n2, 1918). So that the reference to the fish looks\nlike a correction of the previous statement as tO'\nthe position of the things referred to.]\nAnother attempt of A. V. B. to describe the crystal\nball occurred on October 12, 1918, and is perhaps worth\nquoting, if only because it is rather amusing. In the-\ncourse of an attempt, more or less successful, to describe\nvarious objects in the room, Feda said :\nF. You ought to have a ball there too, a hard, cold\nball. If you put it to your face it would make\nyou jump it's so cold.\nM. R. H. I place that.\nF. It seems to Feda to have a kind of shine or polish\non it, and it gives Feda\u2014is it light or something I\nIt gives Feda reflection in it. Ladye says she\nalways feels she wants to get into the middle of it.\nM. R. H. Good.\nF. She says : \"It always makes me long to get right\ninto the centre of it.

She says it's a nice en-\ncouraging message about the work that you and\njVIrs. Una is doing for Ladye.

That she'd have had to have found somebody else ?\n^ yo, it just suggests what she's just been talking\nabout.\n[The book indicated was found to be Rudyard\nKipling's Kim.

For there had been long and intimate talks\nbetween Ijiem as to the advisabihty or the reverse\nof their collaborating in psychical research before\nthey made up their minds to do so, and their\nfriendship was thus definitely founded.]\nThis case is, I think, less convincing than the one-\nquoted in the text, not only because the assumption that\np. 3 of Ki7n was meant is a very doubtful one, but\nbecause the method of the mistake if it was a genuine one\nis less easy to grasp. It does not seem as if any omission\nof Feda's or inexact repetition by her of what she was\ntold at the moment would account for it.

But, if so, it must have come in by association\nof ideas\u2014not by \" sensing \" the word itself.\nEND OF APPENDIX.\n\fA SUGGESTED NEW METHOD OF RESEARCH.\nBy W. Whately Smith.\nSome months ago I suggested, in a letter to the Journal,\nthat it might be possible to apply the word-association\ntest as a means of investigating the psychological status\nof the \" controls \" of mediumistic trance. At that time\nI contemplated relying solely on the actual words given\nby the personalities under examination in answer to the\nstimulus words of the test. As- a result of recent experi-\nmental work, however, I have been able to devise a\nmethod of research which appears to be far better adapted\nto the end in view. This method I propose to describe\nhere. Its object is to determine, by purely objective\nmeans, whether the \" controls \" of mediumistic trance are\nthe independent discarnate entities which they claim to\nbe or whether they should be regarded as \" secondary\npersonalities \" strictly analogous to those with which\npsychopathologists are familiar. The importance of obtain-\ning a solution of this problem needs no emphasis.\nFor the benefit of readers who are unacquainted with\nthe word-association test I may briefly describe it as\nfollows :\nThe experimenter calls out to the subject, one by one,\na list of words\u2014usually 100 in all\u2014and the subject is\ninstructed to reply to each word as it is called out, as\nquickly as possible, with the first word which occurs to\nhim, regardless of whether it \" makes sense \" or not.\nHe must not, of course, prepare his answer before the\nword is called out. The words of the list are called the\n\" stimulus-words \" and the subject's replies the \" reaction\nwords.\"'\nThe time which elapses between the calling out of the\n\f402 Tf. Whafely Smith. [part\nstimulus word by the experimenter and the subject's\nanswering is commonly measured in fifths of a second\nwith an ordinary stop-watch and this interval is known\nas the \" reaction-time.\"\nIt has been found that any marked prolongation of the\nreaction-time is generally a sign that the stimulus word\nhas awakened, by association, a group of ideas of strong\nemotional significance to the subject\u2014most usually of a\npainful or disagreeable nature.\nSome account of the method, illustrated by a striking\nexample, will be found in the Proceedings. Vol. XXIV.\npp. 676 and 677. The classical work on the subject is\nJung's Studies in Word Association and most works on the\ntechnique of psycho-analysis deal with it in greater or less\ndetail.\nThe length of the reaction-time, coupled with the\nobservation of certain other signs, is a good enough guide\nfor most practical purposes, but it is too unreliable and\ntoo susceptible to fortuitous interference to be of much\nvalue for precise quantitative work. It is, among other\ndefects, liable to prolongation hy causes quite other than\nthe intensity of the emotion or \" affective tone \" ^ evoked\nby the stimulus word and, as will appear later, it is the\naffective tone which we wish to measure.\nA far more delicate and precise method of doing this\nis afforded by the phenomenon known as the \" psycho-\ngalvanic reflex.*'\nIt has been found that if a weak electric current is\npassed through the human body, between suitable points,\nthe amount passing, as measured by a galvanometer, is\nincreased i f any stimulus is applied which arouses emotion,\nor causes a change of \" affective tone \" in the person\nunder examination. In other words the resistance of the\nbody (of the skin to be accurate) is lowered whenever\nthe subject experiences what may loosely be called a\n\" wave of emotion.\" Given a suitable subject under\ngood conditions, this test is extremely delicate and, as I\n^ The term \" affective tone is more strictly accurate than \" emotion.\"\nThose who are unfamiliar with psychological terminology may regard\nthe words as approximately synonymous.\n\fLXXXI.] Suggested Neio Method of Research. 403\nhave recently showTi by experiment, is capable of dis-\ncriminating shades of affective tone with far greater\nnicety than the reaction-time. As a result of the recent\nobservation and statistical analj'^is of some 12,000 reactions\nin the word-association test with some seventy different\nsubjects, I have no hesitation in saying that as a measure\nof affective tone this reflex is incomparabl}' superior to\nthe reaction-time for quantitative work.^\nI myself have always used an ordinary D\" Arsonval\ngalvanometer (resistance about 92 ohms) in conjunction\nwith a Wheatstone bridge of which the external resist-\nance was formed by two zinc -plate electrodes, covered\nwith wash-leather and soaked in salt-solution, which were\napplied to the palm and back of the subject\" s left hand.\nWith this arrangement excellent reactions to the word-\nassociation test can be obtained from the great majority\nof subjects and it is most striking to see how a person\nwho steadily gives reactions of, say, 10 to 15 scale divisions\nfor the majority of stimulus words will suddenly give\none of 50 or 60 or more when a word is called out which,\nfor some reason or other, arouses an emotionally significant\ngroup of ideas.\n^\nIn order to understand how these facts can be utilised\nfor the investigation of trance personalities it is necessary\nto ask ourselves ivhy a word should arouse intense emotion\n^ The chief points of superiority are :\n(i) It is not under voluntary control.\n(ii) It is not affected by purely \" intellectual \" difficulties such as\nmay misleadingly prolong the reaction-time.\n(iii) The galvanometer deflection appears to be very approximately\nproportional to the intensity of the affective tone no matter\nhow great it maj' be. while prolongation of reaction-time\nis not.\n(iv) Subject to certain teclmical reservations which would be out\nof place here, the galvanometer detects both pleasant and\nunpleasant tone while the reaction-time tends to indicate\nonly the latter.\n' For the benefit of those who are ignorant of electrical matters I may\nbriefly paraphrase the foregoing by saying that any evocation of\nemotion is accompanied by a change in the electrical properties of the\nskin which can be accurately measured by the use of suitable apparatus.\nThis change is very closely proportional to the intensity of the emotion\nevoked and can be used with confidence as a measure of it.\n\f404 W. WJmtely Smith. [part\nin one person and little or none in another. The reason\nis, of course, that the word is associated in the mind of\nthe first person with emotional or exciting experiences,\nwhile it has no such association in the second case. The\naffective tone aroused in a given subject by a stimuhis\nword is, in fact, determined by and is a function of that\nsubject's experience. But the experience of every indi-\nvidual is unique and inasmuch as the reactions to stimulus\nwords are determined by experience we should conse-\nquently expect these reactions to be correspondingly\nunique for each individual tested. The actual degree in\nwhich they will be so must depend, of course, on the\nkind of stimulus words used. There a.re certain words\nsuggesting ideas of universal interest which produce strong\nreactions in almost everyone and it is obvious that a list\ncontaining a large proportion of such words would bring\nout the differences between individuals much less clearly\nthan one consisting entirely of words which could only\nexcite emotion by virtue of their associations with experi-\nences peculiar to the particular individual concerned.\nSubject to this condition, however, we would confidently\nanticipate on general psychological grounds that a subject's\nreactions to a list of words would be uniquely character-\nistic of that subject.\nBut before we can use these considerations in the\nconstruction of a method of research it is necessary to\ntest their validity by experiment and to obtain some\nquantitative criterion for future use. This I have recently\nbeen able to do.\nIn order to approximate as closely as possible to the\nideal of a list containing no words of universal interest,\nI deleted from my original list the twenty words which\nin previous experiments had been found to arouse the\nmost intense affective tone in subjects as a whole. I\nreplaced them by twenty other words which I judged\nless likely to arouse intense affective tone in the average\nsubject.\nI need not here go into other minor points of technique\nand methods of computation which I adopted in order\nto render the results obtained as free as possible from\n\fLXXXI.] Suggested Neiv Method of Research. 405\nthe effects of accidental errors. My object was to ascer-\ntain whether the extent of the agreement between the\nreactions given by any two individuals was saliently less\nthan that between the reactions given by any one\nindividual on different occasions. In other words : do the\nreactions of subject A taken on different occasions agree\nbetween themselves more closely than they agree with the\nreactions of subject B ? If so is the difference sufficiently\nmarked to enable us to determine whether two sets of\nreactions, of unknown origin, emanate from the same\nindividual or from two different individuals ?\n^\nThe extent to which any two series of measurements\n(in this case reactions to stimuh) agree can be calculated\nand expressed with mathematical precision in the form\nof a Coefficient of Correlation. This is a figure which may\nhave any value between +rO for two series which agree\nperfectly and -I'O for two which disagree perfectly.\nSeries which are wholly unrelated will give a coefficient\nof correlation of 0. Thus the two series 1, 7, 8, 11, 56,\n49, 18, 3, 14 and 3, 21, 24, 33, 168, 147, 54, 9, 42, will\ngive a coefficient of + TO because each increases or decreases\nin precise conformity to the other. On the other hand\nthe series 7, 12, 9, 8, 4, 7, 6, 12, 2, 3, increases and\ndecreases in a manner precisely opposite to the behaviour\nof the series 7, 2, 5, 6, 10, 7, 8, 2, 12, 11,\u2014when one\nincreases the other proportionately decreases\u2014and the\ncoefficient of correlation between these two will be - I'O.\nThe method whereby this figure, expressive of the\nextent of agreement between two series of observations,\nis calculated is familiar to statisticians but need not be\ndescribed here : the point is that if we are given two\nseries of measurements we can assess their agreement\nin a wholly unambiguous fashion.\nIf, then, we are right in conjecturing that the psycho-\ngalvanic reactions to a suitable list of words, is uniquely\ncharacteristic of the subject tested, the coefficient of corre-\n^ In order to eliminate chance variations and to obtain representative\nsets of reactions I caused each of my subjects to undergo repeated\ntests from which average figures could be obtained.

That\nis to say we could calculate the precise chance that a\ncoefficient of correlation between two series of reactions\nof unknown origin had arisen from correlating the re-\nactions of the same individuals or of two different\nindividuals.\nFor practical purposes, however, such experiments are\n\"unnecessary and we can say with considerable assurance\nthat any coefficient greater than -f5 is tmlikely to have\nproceeded from correlating the reactions of two different\nindividuals and that one of less than -i--3 is unlikely to\nrepresent a single individual.\nNow let us suppose the test to be apphed to a suitable\ntrance medium, first in the normal state and, second,\nunder control. (It will of course be advisable to apply\nthe test several times in each state in order to obtain\naverage reactions.) We shall thus obtain two series of\nreactions of which one will be characteristic of the normal\npersonality, the other of the \" control.\" If we then work\nout the coefficient of correlation between these two series\nthe result should throw considerable light on the question\nof whether the control personality is really identical with\nthe normal personality or not.\nIf the two series of reactions were substantially the\nsame, if, that is to say, the coefficient proved to be of\nthe same order as those obtained by correlating individuals\nwith themselves (about +\"6 or more) we should conclude\nthat the \" control \" is really no more than a different\nversion, so to speak, of the normal personality and deter-\nmined by the same mental content. Even this would\n\f408 W. Whatehj Smith. [part\nconstitute a very considerable advance in positive know-\nledge of mediumistic states.\nBut if the two series were radically different, if the\ncoefficients were of the same order as those obtained by\ncorrelating the reactions of different individuals (about\n+ \"3 or less) then even the most sceptical of orthodox\npsychologists would be forced to consider very seriously\nthe claim of the \" control to be regarded as an inde-\npendent personahty totally distinct from that of the\nmedium.^\nThe first of these alternatives would be confidently\nexpected by most psychologists and would occasion little\nsurprise to students of Psychical Research.-\nBut the second possibility demands somewhat closer\nconsideration. There are two ways in which the con-\nclusion that the control is a personality distinct from that\nof the medium could be evaded.\nThe first of these is by attribviting the result to chance.\nThis could, in general, be met by repeating the experiment\nwith other mediums. If necessary the question could be\nreduced to terms of exact mathematical probability by\nperforming a sufficient number of tests on normal persons\nto enable us to calculate the precise chance that the\napparent independence of medium and control was acci-\ndental. This would be extremely laborious and would\nnot, in practice, prove necessary : if the coefficient of\ncorrelation between medium and control were as low as,\nsay +'2 in two or three experiments, their independence\nwould be established with a very high degree of pro-\nbability and the precise magnitude of that probability\n^ It is, of course, possible that an indeterminate result might be\nobtained. A coefficient of correlation of + -4, for example, would not\nbe helpful if the above figures are taken as a standard of comparison.\nThis contingency can to some extent be guarded against by using the\nagreement of the medium with herself and of the control with itself\nas a basis of comparison for the agreement of the medium with the-\ncontrol.\n^ It must be tinderstood that I am here referring to what I may\nterm \"general\" controls, of the type to which \"Rector,\" \" Phinuit\n\"\nand \" Feda \" belong, as opposed to 'personal'\" controls such as\nHodgsonp, MyerSj,, or the \" A.V.B.\" control in the case of Mrs. Leonard.\n\fLxxxi.] Stiggesfed New Method of Research. 409\nwould be of no practical interest. It is worth remember-\ning, however, that the method is of a nature amenable\nto rigid mathematical treatment if required.\nThe other line of criticism would involve the supposition\nthat a secondary personality can be determined by a mass\nof experience completely cut oS from that which deter-\nmines the normal personahty. In my opinion this supposi-\ntion is not justified by our knowledge either of psycho-\nlogical mechanisms in general or of the phenomena of\nsecondary personahty in particular. We know, to be\nsure, that experiences extending over a considerable period\nmay be whoUy forgotten and rendered completely in-\naccessible to consciousness so far as the voKtion of the\npatient is concerned ; such amnesias are a common enough\nfeature of pathological cases. But we also know that\nthese dissociated tracts of experience are not dead and\ninactive, not segregated into completely watertight com-\npartments or separated by an impassable gulf from the\nrest of the mental content.\nIf an emotional experience within the forgotten period\nis stimulated by an appropriate word in an association\ntest the subject reacts, although he may remain com-\npletely amnesic to the incidents which invest the word\nwith its emotional significance.^ Similarly the \"repressed\"\nmaterial familiar to psycho-analysts gives rise to reactions\nwhen it is stimulated, although it cannot come directly\ninto consciousness.\nThis shows that the fact of a mass of experience being\n\" dissociated \" and inaccessible to consciousness does not\nmean that it cannot be reached by stimuli or that it\ncannot influence reactions. Hence, although the normal\npersonahty may be wholly amnesic to and unconscious\nof the experiences which determine the characteristics and\nbehaviovir of the secondary\u2014abnormal\u2014personality, we\nshould, by analogy, expect that these dissociated experi-\n^ This is well paralleled by what happens in the case of functional\nanaesthesia in connection with which the term \" dissociation \" is also\nused. A patient will not be conscious of a painful stimulus applied\nto the functionally anaesthesic areas but, if connected to the galvano-\nmeter, he will react just as well as he does when the stimulus is applied\nto the normallj- sensitive areas of his body.\n\f410 W. Whately Smith. ^\n[part\nences would none the less influence the reactions of the\nnormal personality, and conversely.\nThat this is actually so is indicated by the work of\nPrince and Peterson on the \" A.C.B. \" case.^ These\nexperimenters selected words which were known to be of\nemotional significance to the subject in one of her states\nand then applied them to her as stimuli when in a\nclifferent state. They found that larger psycho-galvanic\nreflexes were evoked by these words than by indifferent\nwords, in spite of the fact that in the second state the\nsubject was amnesic to and ignorant of the incidents\nwhich, experienced in the first state, had invested the\nwords with their significance.\nAll the available evidence suggests, therefore, that if\nthe \" control \" of mediumistic trance is no more than a\nsecondary personality of the medium, we ought to obtain\nsubstantially identical series of reactions no matter whether\nthe stimuli are applied to the normal or to the control\npersonality.\nIt would, of course, be very desirable to confirm this\nby comparative experiments on subjects whose mutations\nof personality are without doubt purely pathological ; but\nsuch cases are rare.\nI may point out here that it is quite possible that\na \" general \"'\ncontrol might give reactions substantially\nidentical with those of the normal medium, while a\n\" personal \" control might give quite difi^erent results.\nIf this were so we should have good reason for supposing\nthat the former is a secondary personality and the latter\nreally the separate individual which it purports to be.\nI myself anticipate with some confidence that\n'\n' general\ncontrols would prove to be secondary personalities, but\nthe issue seems more doubtful in the case of \" personal\ncontrols.\nI need hardly add that to prove that either or both\nvarieties of control are merely secondary personalities\nwould still leave open the problem of the ultmiate origin\nof evidential matter.\nI have necessarily omitted to deal with many details\n^Journal, of Abnormal Psychology, 1908.\n\fLxxxi.] Suggested New Method of Research. 411\nof technique and. procedure which it would be necessary\nto consider in the actual application of this method to a\nconcrete case.

Letter from the Right Hon. G. W. Balfour to\nMr. Whately Smith.\nFisher\"s Hell, Woking,\nFebruary 17, 1921.\nDear Mr. Whately Smith,\nYour interesting ' Paper on A Suggested Neiv Method\nof Research has been sent to me in proof, and as you asked\nme to let you have any criticisms of it which occurred to\nme, you may perhaps think the following remarks worthy\nof your consideration.\nYour argument requires us to accept as scientifically esta-\nblished that, in the case of secondary personalities recognised\nas such, substantially identical series of reactions are regularly\nobtained to whatever state \" of the individual the stimuli\nare applied. This may be true, but I venture to think that\nfar more experimental evidence is necessary before it can\nbe regarded as firmly established.\nLet us, however, assume it as a working hypothesis, and\nconsider the further conclusions to which you think your\nproposed method of investigation may legitimately lead.\nAs an illustration, suppose the method apiDlied to Mrs.\nLeonard and to Feda, and that substantially identical reactions\nare obtained from Feda and from the medium in her normal\nstate. This would show that, so far as the method ivent,\nno distinction could be d^a^^^l between the case of Feda and\nthat of the undoubted secondary personalities hitherto experi-\nmented upon. But it would not, and could not, prove that\nFeda was not an independent conscious personality \" control-\nling \" the medium, unless we make the further assumption\nthat such an independently conscious personality would exhibit\nthe same kind of difference in the sizes of its reactions as\n413\n\f414 W. Whately Smith. [part\ncompared with those of the medium as is found to exist\nbetween two individuals with two distinct bodies. Now this\nis a very big assumption indeed ; for whatever the nature\nof the contiol may be, it is of the essence of the case that\ncontrol and medium, at all events for the time being, have\na single body in common.\nNext suppose that the reaction series obtained showed\ndifferences similar to those presented by two normal individuals.\nFrom this it would be legitimate to conclude that the nature\nof the dissociation in the case of Mrs. Leonard and Feda\nwas different from that observed in admitted cases of double\npersonality. But it would not be safe to go further and infer\nthat Feda was an independent personality controlling Mrs.\nLeonard. For it would still be possible to contend that a\ndifference in the nature of the dissociation was of itself\nsufficient to account for the differences in the reaction series.\nBy far the most interesting case would arise if the reaction\nseries were found to be substantially the same as between\nFeda and the medium, and substantially different as between\nFeda and (say) A. V. B. when in full control. This would\ncertainly be suggestive ; but even in that event I am not\nquite clear what conclusions respecting the nature of the two\ncontrols could properly be drawn from it.\nPlease understand that I am far from saying that the\nexperiments you suggest are not well worth making, if it is\nfound possible to make them. Only I doubt whether they are\ncapable of throwing as much light on the question you particu-\nlarly wish to resolve as I gather from your Paper you anticipate.\nBelieve me. Yours very truly, G. W. Balfoctk.\n2. Mr. Whately Smith's Reply.\n42 Trumpington Street,\nCambridge, February 21, 1921.\nDear Mr. Balfour,\nI am very much obliged to you for your valuable\ncriticisms of my paper. In answer to them I should like\nto say, first of all, that I do not claim that experiments on\n\fLxxxi.] Suggested Neic Method of Research. Ajyperidix. 415\nthe lines suggested would be conclusive ; but I believe that\nthey are capable of giving fairly reliable indications which will\nassist us in forming judgments about the i^roblems involved.\nI quite agree that much more experimental evidence is\nneeded before we can regard the substantial identity of the\nreactions obtained from two alternatmg personalities Ioiowti\nto be pathological as an invariable feature of such states.\nBut, as pointed out in my paper, all the available evidence\npoints this way at present.\nI do not think that the fact of the control using the\nmedium's body invalidates the assumption (I should prefer\nto say the presumption) that the former, if an independent\nentity, would give reactions different from those of the medium.\nThis, surely, A\\ould only obtain if the control were also using\nthe medium's 7m7id. For the magnitude of the reaction to\na given word depends on that word's emotional significance\nwhich, in turn, is determined by the associations which the\nword has acquired as a result of the individual's experience.\nIf the experiences of medium and control are identical I cannot\nsee how one can call them separate personalities and. if\ndifferent, then the emotional significance of various words\nand the magnitudes of the corresponding reactions should be\ndifferent also.\nIt is, of course, possible\u2014though not, I think, probable\n\u2014\nthat the medium's mind is implicated in the process of control\nas well as her body (assuming the existence of discarnate\nentities) and if this is so one would expect that the stimulus\nwords giving large reactions with the medium in her normal\nstate would do so also when under control, but that one\nwould find, in addition, other large reactions peculiar to the\ncontrol herself. Careful comparison of the records should\nmake it possible to detect this, although the quantitative\nindications of the correlation coefficient would be obscured.\nI think the whole value of the method really turns on the\nquestion of whether the dissociation which gives rise to\nalternating personalities of the pathological order can result\nin the segregation of masses of experience into water-tight\nconpartments \" in such a way as to render the various\ncomplexes and constellations inaccessible, or accessible in a\nmarkedly lessened degree, to stimulus words. To discuss this\n\f416 W. Whately Smith.

On the contrary, all the facts\nof Hypnosis, Dream, Psycho-analytic procedure.
