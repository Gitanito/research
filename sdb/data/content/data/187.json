His father was Sir Claude Cavendish Inglis, a hydraulic engineer; his mother was Lady Vera Inglis (n\u00e9e Blood). He attended school in Shrewsbury,&nbsp;then Trinity College, Dublin and Magdalen College, Oxford. He was awarded a PhD in history after having served in the RAF Coastal Command during World War II.\n\nIn 1954 Inglis joined The Spectator, first as assistant editor, then editor, turning it into&nbsp;\u2018by far the most lively and readable of the weekly papers\u2019 and&nbsp;championing progressive social causes.1 In 1962 he began a new career in television, presenting the long-running programmes What the Papers Say and All Our Yesterdays. He died in 1993.   Psychical Research\n\nAn obituarist writes:   \n\nFor the last 20 years, Inglis had taken an interest in, as he entitled one of his books, \u2018Science and Parascience\u2019, including extra-sensory perception, homeopathic medicine and spontaneous combustion. This got him into furious rows in the correspondence columns with scientists of a traditional nature. However, Inglis never became obsessed with such matters and seldom introduced them into his conversation with friends, which was always gossipy and amusing.2\n\nInglis was an active member of the Society for Psychical Research contributing reviews and comment to its journal. &nbsp;&nbsp;He presented the ITV three-part series \u2018Margins of the Mind\u2019 in 1968, a documentary investigation of dowsing, spiritual healing and telepathy. His publications about the paranormal described coincidence, dreams, trance, altered states of mind, clairvoyance, precognition and especially alternate types of healing; also, early research of spirit mediums.&nbsp; &nbsp;Of particular note is his two-volume history of the&nbsp;scientific research of the paranormal,&nbsp;Natural and Supernatural&nbsp;(covering&nbsp;antiquity to 1914) and&nbsp;Science and Parascience&nbsp;(1915-1939), a well-researched survey of the development of scientific approaches to anomalous phenomena.&nbsp;\n\nPlans to bring the subject up-to-date in a third volume were interrupted by his death.3\n\nTogether with Arthur Koestler and Tony Bloomfield, Inglis co-created the KIB foundation, the forerunner to the Koestler Parapsychology Unit based at the University of Edinburgh.
