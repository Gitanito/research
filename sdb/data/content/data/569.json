We have now in our Society about 700 Members and\nAssociates, (not counting the American onp.&,) and as I pointed out\n. before, if all of them would collect 25 answers and induce one friend to\ndo the same-a task which ought not, generally speaking, to be very\ndifficult,-we should thus get 35,000 answers, and this number, though\nnot so large as I should like, would probably enable us to calculate\nfrom the census itself, with sufficient approximation to accuracy, the\n2 n\nDigitized by Google\n\f430 The Oensus of Hulltwinatiol1R. [July 11,\nproportion of coincidental to non-coincidental phantasms. Tht!J impor-\ntance of this result, as relieving us from the necessity of forming a.\nconjectural estimate of the size of the circle from which our\" veridical\"\ncases are drawn, was explained in my last addre.'IS. At present, how-\never, only about 74 :Members or Associates have, so far as we know,\ngiven any help, and if it had not been for the great efforts made by\nsome of these-which I most gratefully acknowledge-and for help\nreceived from outsiders, we should not have attained to our present\nmodest number of answers-6,481.\nOf the 6,481 people whose answers we have, 72;, or about 11 per\ncent., answer in the affirmative, and 751 experiences are described.\u2022\nThese may be divided into 474 cases where the sense of sight wns\naffected, 219 cases where voices were heard without any accompanying\nvisual impression, and 56 cases where the impression was only on the\nsense of touch, besides 2 where the touch was accompanied by 1\\\nnon-vocal auditory impression. In about 48 out of the whole number,\nmore than one sense was affected, besides 26 more in which, along with\na visual or tactual impression, some non-vocal sounds occurred, which\ndo not come within the scope of the present inquiry. It is often\ndifficult in the case of sounds, and especially of non-vocal sounds, such\nas rustling, footsteps, &c., to ascertain whether they were hallucinatory\nor not.\nOut of the 751 cases, 98,01' about 13 per cent., may be called coinci-\ndental; that is, they are cases in which the hallucination has coincided\nin time with some condition of another person, who may be regarded\nas the agent, in such a way as to suggest a causal connection between\nthat condition and the hallucination.\nSome of these experiences that I have called coincidental must be\nadmitted t.() fall under Mr. Gurney's head, \"ambiguous.\" On the other\nhand, among cases clo.ssed as non-coincidental, there are a certain\nnumber which there is some reason to regard as other than purely\nsubjective. Thus there are 6 cases of the figure and 1 of the voice of\ndead persons phantl\\smally seen or heard when the percipient was\nunaware of the death. There are 9 cases (7 of an unrecognised figure,\n1 of a recognised living person, and 1 of a recognised dead person)\nwhere apparently the same figure is independently seen by more than\none person on different occasions. In one of these 1\\ figure in a brown\ndress with broad lace collar and golden hair wo.s seen hy three persons\n.on different occasions in a certain house, two of these experiences\n10f the persona who have had eXllerienOO8. 121 have given no particulars. On\ntbe other band, 217 peNon8 have bad more than one experience. A 1arge proportion\nof these, however, were recurrent experiences of a trivia] kind, such as bearing the\nIlame called, or feeling touches. 'Ve have counted recurrent experiences not described\nsingly as one.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1890.] The CenSlt8 of Hallu,cincttions. 431\nbeing certainly independent- that is, the second percipient knew\nnothing about the experience of the first. The figure was afterwards\nthought to be recognised as that of a living lady dressed similarly j\nbut as only a part of the ghost's face was seen, the recognition can\nhardly be counted on.\nFinally, there are 66 collective cases-cases, that is, in which more\nthan one person shares the experience-besides 12 collective cases\nwhich have been already counted as coincidental. These are the\nnumbers if we count the persons answering our question who have\nseen\" collective phantasms.\" But, as sometimes more than one of the\njoint percipients is included among these, the whole number of\nphantasms collectively seen and heard is rather smaller, viz.: 10\ncoincidental ones and 55 non-coincidental ones-65 in all, of which\n47 were visual as regards at least one of the percipients. The\nnumber would be still further reduced by excluding from it those cases\nwhere there seems to be a possibility that the figure seen or the \"oice\nheard was not hallucinatory at all but real. Precisely how large\nthis reduction should be we can only guess, but I will give one of\nour reasons for thinking that some reduction is necessary. We find\nthat out of the visual collective cases, more than half occurred out of\ndoors, while of the visual cases occurring to a single percipient, only\nabout one seventh occurred out of doors. Now, though some supposed\napparitions seen out of doors are quite as obviously true hallucina-\n.tions as SOme of those seen indoors, still, speaking generally, there\nseem to be several reasons why real human beings are more likely\nto be mistaken for apparitions out of doors than indoors. In the first\nplace, if a figure appears in a room its distance is seldom great enough\nto make recognition doubtful, so that cases of mistaken identity are\nless likely to occur indoors. Further, if the figure be unrecognised,\nthis can seldom be regarded as evidence of its hallucinatory character\nout of doors, while it often would afford evidence indoors, since it is\nndt'\"usual for strangers to walk into our rooms without anyone in the\nhouse knowing anything about it. And, again, the mode of appearance\nand disappearance of the figure is much more often clearly impossible\nfor a real person indoors than it is out of doors. The figure lOay, for\ninstance, go through a locked door, or through the wall, or into a room\ninto which it is at once followed, and where it is not found. Out of\ndoors it is often difficult to prove that the vanished figure has not\nsimply turned into a house, or been hidden by an intervening bush or\nother obstacle, especially since its distance is often much greatel\u00b7 than\nthat of a hallucinatory figure seen in the house.\nAfter making all allowances, however, there remains a certain\nnumber of collective cases in which the objects seen can hardly have\nbeen real people or things.\n2 n 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f4132 The Oe1UJU8 of Hallucinati01l8. [July 11,\nNow granting that collective hallucinations really occur-and,\napart from this census, we have by this time accumulated a good deal\nof evidence of the fact-they are obviously of great theoretical impor-\ntance in considering the nature and origin of hallucinations. I there-\nfore propose to make a few reouu'ks on them this evening. The most\nobvious explanation of the \"collectiveness\" of a hallucination is that it\nhas for both percipients some common origin indE>pendent of either of\nthem. This common origin might be telepathic, some other mind\naffecting them both similarly and simultaneously, or it might be what\nI may call \"physical suggestion,\" by which I mean some real external\ncause,-say a sound like a footstep-starting by \" suggestion\" a similar\nhallucination in both of them. Now though it seems not improbable\nthat the hallucination is sometimes produced telepathically in both\npercipients at once by some other mind, living or dead, this can hardly\nbe the explanation always. For instance, it is unlikely that a psychical\ncause external to both percipients made two girls at a dancing class\nsimultaneously see a chair in the middle of the 1Ioor where no chair\nwas, or produced for two other percipients an appearance of a grey\nobject about the size of a man's head, which rose and fell again Ilear\nthem ns they sat at luncheon. It is equally arbitrary to explain by\nexternal psychical agency cases where the phantasm collectively seen\nrepresents a living person who was in no unusual condition at the time.\nFor instance, two young ladies and their brother going along the passage\none day saw their father going upstairs. One of them also heard his\nfootsteps while the other two were struck by the absence of sound.\nThough none of them saw him very distinctly, they all independently\nfelt convinced at the moment that it was their father; but their father\nwas at the time sitting quietly reading in the dining.room and it\ncould not have been any other real human being.\nAs regards the second possible hypothesis, that what I have called\nphysical suggestion is the common origin of the hallucination in the\ntwo percipients, it may reasonably be nsked whether we have any\nevidence that a hallucination is ever thus produced. We know, of\ncourse, that verbo.l suggestion will often make hypnotised people see\nhallucinations, but it is a great step from this to assuming that halluci-\nnations can be produced in this way in the case of people in 0. normal\nstate, and it is a still further step to assume as possible the non-verbal\nand therefore less definite suggestion, which is all that we can suppose\nto occur in the present cases. Hallucinations, however, are so rare in\nthe experience of most of us that it may fairly be argued that when\nwe see them we are not quite in a normal state, and I think there is\nreason to believe that self-suggestion sometimes operates during a.\nhallucination, for it is sometimes difficult otherwise to account for the\noccasional agreement of two senses. For instance, a lady in the dark\nDigitized by Google\n\f1890.] The Oem-us of HaUucinations. 433\nfirst feels her husband's presence, then putting out her ha.nd, feels his\ncoo.t-sleeve, and then hears him speak. The husband, meanwhile, is\nabsent and vh-idly imagining himself to be bringing her bad news. A\nreflected hallucination such as I mentioned in my last address is\nagain an instance of the operation of self-suggestion during a halluci-\nnation, though only one sense is affected.\nBut in these cases it is hallucination that leads to further halluci-\nnation. It is a different question whether real sounds ever lead to\nvisual and other hallucinations by suggestion. It appears to me prob-\nable from the evidence that in some cases they do and that muscular\n5ensations suggesting touches do so also, but it is difficult to prove this\nbecause it is difficult to prove that the sounds and touches are not\nthemselves hallucinatory: I will, however, give one instance from the\nCensus collection of a case pri1lld facie collective where the probability\nthat a real sound wrongly interpreted led to different visual experiences\nappears to me very strong. Two sisters within hearing of the front\ndoor, and within sight of different parts of the passage leading from it\nto the living rooms, but not within sight of each other, heard their\nfather's latchckey in the door and heard him come in. One of them\n(who is now dead) then saw her father, and the other saw his dog pass\nthe door of the room where she was. It was their father's habit to\ntake a walk with his dog and return about this hour, but on the par-\nticular afternoon in question he and the dog were dozing in the dining-\nroom. The same explanation might be applied in any other Ca5e prima\nfacie collective, in which there was a common perception of sounds\npossibly real, but diverse visual hallucinations. But it does not seem\napplicable to cases where the things seen are decidedly more alike than\none can easily suppose they would be from the slight amount of sug-\ngestion received.\nThis difficulty also occurs in connection with a third explanation of\ncollective hallucinations, viz., that A sees a hallucination first and then\nconveys it by word or gesture to B. In certain cases this is plausible.\nRecognised figures might be suggested by a brief exclamation, and in\nsom.e cases it is clear that one percipient was aware that the other saw\nsomething before he saw it himself. But it is difficult to see how an\nunfamiliar figure could be so suggested, and the detailed resemblances\nin our collective cases are sometimes of too marked a character for us\neasily to suppose that they were the result of comparing notes after-\n'wards and pseudo-memory. Moreover, our informants have sometimes\ntaken pains, according to their recollection, to avoid any conscious\nsuggestion to one another.\nThere remains a fourth hypothesis, viz., that the hallucination of\none percipient is ca.used by mental suggestion or thought-transference\n\"from the other. This hypothesis avoids the difficulty as to the\nDigitized by Google\n\f4340 The Censu,,'l of Hallw:illativlIR. [July 11.\nsimilarity of the two hallucinations, since it seems quite as likely that\nthe general idea as to fOl1n, colour, &c., of a hallucination seen by A\nshould be conveyed telepathically to B, as that the general idea of the\nfonu and colour of what the agent was looking at in Mr. Guthrie's\nexperiments should be conveyed to the percipients. Another difficulty\nattaching to the hypothesis of suggestion is avoided or reduced by\nsupposing thought-transference to operate. It would be a remarkable\ncoincidence that, at the moment when A is having an unusual\nexperience, B should be in the unusual state in which he can be made\nto see the same thing by ordinary suggestion. But if our view about\nveridical apparitions is correct it would seem that a \"telepathic\nimpact\" is itself sometimes a cause of hallucination in the person to\nwhom the ide!l- is transferred. For instance, to take an experimental\ncase-when Baron von Schrenk-Notzing tried, as an experiment, to\nmake a. lady think of him, she saw his face before her, without any\nintention on his part of producing a hallucination. It must be ad-\nmitted that we have at present no crucial instance showing that the act\nof experiencing a hallucination is a. condition specially likely to cause\na telepathic communication with another mind. There are, however.\none or two cases in which such a transfer seems to have occurred. I\nmay remind you of one in Pllantasms of tlte Li\"-ing (V01. II., p. 198).\nquoted from the note-book of Philip Lord Chesterfield. Waking one\nmorning he saw a thing standing like a white sheet, with a knot at\nthe top, and his wife, who was 40 miles away, saw on the same\nmorning and at the same hour \"a. thing all in white with a black\nface\" standing by her bed.\nI may appropriately conclude my address with an account of an\nexperiment made only yesterday by Mrs. Sidgwick, which points\nstrongly in the same direction. With the assistance of Mr. G. A.\nSmith, Mrs. Sidgwick has been tl'ying experiments in thought-\ntransference with hypnotised persons. Two of t.hese were yesterday\nhypnotised in different rooms. We will call them Mr. P. and Miss B.\nYou are no doubt aware that good hypnotic subjects clLn be made to\nhave post-hypnotic hallucinations-e.g., if told while hypnotised that\nthey will see some specified object when they awake, they do see it\nthough there is nothing of the sort there. Mr. Smith told Mr. P. on this\noccasion that Mrs. Sidgwick would show him a picture, and then went\nout of the room and told Miss B. that she would see a picture which 1\\1r.\nP. would show her when her eyes were open. \"'hile he was away Mrs.\nSidgwick told Mr. P. that she was going to show him a picture of a goat-\nchaise with two goats. Then Mr. Smith came back, awoke Mr. P., and\nleft again immediately. After which Mrs. Sidgwick gave Mr. P. a blank\ncard as a picture and he almost immediately saw on it the picture of\nthe goatchaise and t.wo goats and was much pleased with it. Mrs.\n\f1890.] The Cehslhs of Hallucination8. 435\nSidgwick asked him to take it upstairs and show it to Miss B., but to\nbe careful not to tell her what it was--to let her see for herself. This\nhe immediately did. Miss B. at first only snw something black on the\ncard, then by degrees she saw, first some wheels, then \"a nice little wee\ncarriage,\" and presently some animals in front, which she identified as\ntwo goats. As this was-so far as Mrs. Sidgwick can judge--without\nany information from Mr. P. through the ordinary channels of senso\nas to the nature of what he saw, it seems to be a case of collectivo\nhallucination and one which was conveyed to Miss B. by thought-\ntransference from Mr. P. Had Mr. Smith known what Mr. P. saw on\nthe card, we might suppose that he caused Miss B. to see the picture\nby thought-transference, but no one but M.... P. and Mrs. Sidgwick\nknew what he saw, and she has no reason to think t.hat she can convey\nideas telepathically to Miss B. She fails when she tries, while Mr. P.\nhas on other occasions succeeded.\nDigitized by Goo~\n\f436 .A Record of Ob8e1'Vutiom of\nII.\nA RECORD OF OBSERVATIONS OF CERTAIN\nPHENOMENA OF TRANCE.\n(1) INTRODUCTION.\nBy FREDERIC W. H. MYERS.\nIt is proposed in this and in a following Part of the Proceeditlfl' to\ngive SOlDe account of a series of obsen-ations directed to certain trance-\nphenomena. which occur in the case of a lady named Mrs. Piper. Many\nof these observations have been carried on in America by Professor\nWilliam James, Mr. Hodgson, and others; but for a period of two\nmonths and a.-half the phenomena were witnessed by an English\ngr;>up of observers. There is much variety in the phenomena, and\nmuch difficulty in their interpretation; and we shall endeavour to give\nthe independent opinion of each observer, and so to select and analyse\nthe records cited as to give the reader full material for forming a\njudgment of his own. Professor Lodge, Mr. Leaf, and myself, who are\nediting the records, have no theory which we wish to impose upon the\nreader. On certain external or preliminary points, as will be seen, not\nwe three alone, but all who have had adequate opportunity of judgment,\nare decisively agreed. But on the more delicate and interesting question\nas to the origin of the trance-utterances we cannot unite in any absolute\nview. We agree only in maintaining that the utterances show that\nknowledge has been acquired by some intelligence in some supernormal\nfashion ;-and in urging on experimental psychologists the duty of\nwatching for similar cases, and of analysing the results in some such\nway as we have endeavoured to do.\nThe study of trance-utterances, indeed, is at first sight distasteful;\nsince real and pretended trance-utterances have notoriously been the\nvehicle of much conscious and unconscious fraud. aut we urge that,\njust as the physical and psychical phenomena of hysteria-long\nneglected as 0. mere jungle of trickeries-are now analysed with\nadequate security against deception, and with most fruitful results, so\nalso these utterances are now capable of being rationally studied,-\nthanks to the advance in the comprehension of automatic phenomena.\nwhich French and English effort during the last few years has achieved.\nThese utterances, although they often occur ill hysterical subjects,\nseem to have no necessary connection with hysteria. Nor again have\nwe \"any real ground for calling them morbid per ,e, although their\nexcessive repetition may lead to morbid states. All that we can safely\nDigitized by Google\n\fOe11ain Phenorrum,(t of TTance. 43'1\nsay is that they are a form of automatism; that they constitute one of\nmany classes of phenomena which occur in sane subjects without\nentering the normal waking consciousness or forming part of tho\nhabitual chain of memory.\nIn previous discussions in these pages we have dhided automatism\ninto active and passive types 1 ; active automatism consisting of such\nphenomena as automatic writing and tranc:&-utterance-passive, of\nhallucinations of sight, hearing, \u00abc. \"The automatism may be called\nactive if it finds a motor channel, pa88ive if it finds a sensory channel,\nbut the impulse whence it originates may be much the same in the one\ncase as in the other.\"\nIn the paper from which I quote I remarked on the unsubstantial\ncharacter of trance-utterances in general. \"Trance-addresses are\neminently barren of fact; they generally show little more than a\nmere power of improvisation, which may either be fraudulently\npractised, or may be a characteristic faculty of the unconscious self.\"\nWhen, therefore, we were informed by trusted witnesses,-by Pr0-\nfessor William James, who is a physician as well as a psychologist, and\nby Mr. Hodgson, whose acumen in the detection of imposture has been\nproved in more fields than one,-that the utterances of Mrs. Piper's\ntrance did in their view unquestionably contain facts of which Mrs.\nPiper in her waking state was wholly ignorant, some inquiry into the\ncharacter of this trance seemed to fall in the direct line of our work.\nAlthough Mrs. Piper is not actually a \"malade\"-as the French are\nwont to term their subjects of experiment,-her case, from the inquirer's\npoint of yiew, resembles that of the well-known\" Madame B.,\" or any\nother semi-pathological case which needs prolonged study outside the\nwalls of a hospital. We have not, however, asked the Council to devote\nany part of the Society's funds to this inquiry. The Society as such is\nin no way committed to the investigation, nor responsible for any view\nat which the small group of observers may have arrived.\nHoweyor the specific trance-utterances may be interpreted, the case\nas a whole is a rare and remarkable one. It is an instance of automa-\ntism of that extreme kind where the upheaval of sub-conscious strata\nis not merely local, but affects, so to say, the whole psychical area;\n-where a secondary consciousness not only crops up here and there\nthrough the primary, but for a time displaces it ;-where, in short, the\nwhole personality appears to suffer intermittent change.\nAs a general rule, where changes of personality thus complete and\npersistent havc been carefully noted they have seemed to depend either\non hypnotisation, or upon some cerebral injury. Cases like Mrs.\nPiper's are indeed recorded in Spiritualistic literature; but my own\nvisits to some half-dozen \"professional trance-mediums\" had left me\n1 Vol. V\" p.534, .te.\nDigitized by Google\n\f438 .A ReconZ of Obsel'Vaticrns of\nwith little hope that any evidence of value for our purposes would be\nforthcoming from such sources. There was, therefore, much of novelty\nin this case; and at the same time there was thus much of favourable\nprognostic,-that experiment with Madame B. and others had already\nshown that a secondary personality is a state propitious for the\nemergence of telepathic or clairvoyant phenomena.\nMrs. Piper's case has been more or less continuously observed by\nProfessor James and others almost from the date of the first sudden\ninception of the trance, some five years ago. Mr. Hodgson has been\nin the habit of bringing acquaintances of his own to Mrs. Piper, with-\nout giving their names; and many of these have heard from the trance-\nutterance facts about their dead relations, \u00abc., which they feel sure that\nMrs. Piper could not have known. Mr. Hodgson also had Mr. and Mrs.\nPiper watched or \"shadowed\" by private detectives for some weeks.\nwith the view of discovering whether Mr. Piper (who is employed\nin a large store in Boston, U.S.A.) went about inquiring into the\naffairs of possible \"sitters,\" or whether Mrs. Piper received letters from\nfriends or agents conveying information. This inquiry was pushed\npretty closely, but absolutely nothing was discovered which could throw\nsuspicion on Mrs. Piper,-who is now aware of the procedure, but has\nthe good sense to recognise the legitimacy-I may say the scientific\nnecessity-of this kind of probation.\nIt was thus shown that Mrs. Piper made no discoverable attempt\nto acquire knowledge even about persons whose coming she had reason\nto expect. Still less could she have been aware of the private concerns\nof persons brought anonymously to her house at Mr. Hodgson's choice.\nAnd a yet further obstacle to such clandestine knowledge was intro\u00b7\nduced by her removal to England-at our request-in November, 1889.\nProfessor Lodge met her on the Liverpool landing-stage, November\n19th, and conducted her to 0. hotel, where I joined her on November\n20th, and escorted her and her children to Cambridge. She stayed first\nin my house; and I am convinced that she brought with her 0. very\nslender knowledge of English affairs or English people. The servant\nwho attended on her and on her two young children was chosen by\nmyself, and was a young woman from a country village whom I had\nfull reason to believe to be both trustworthy and also quite ignorant\nof my own or my friends' affairs. For the most part I had myself not\ndetermined upon the persons whom I would invite to sit with her. I\nchose these sitters in great measure by chance; sevel-a.l of them were\nnot resident in Cambridge; and (except in one or two cases where\nanonymity would have been hard to preserve) I brought them to her\nunder false names,-sometimes introducing them only when the trance\nhad already begun.\nIn one sitting, for instance, which will be cited below, I learnt by\nDigitized by Google\n\fCertain Pllenomena of T~\u00b7a11('e. 439\naccident that a certain lady, here styled Mrs. A., was in Cambridge j-\na private lady, not a member of the Society for Psychical Research,\nwho had never before visited my house, and whose name had certainly\nnever been mentioned before Mrs. Piper. I introduced this lady as\n:Mrs. Smith j-and I think that when the reader is estimating the\ncorrect facts which were told to her, he may at any rate dismiss from\nhis mind the notion that }l1-s. Piper had been able either to divine that\nthese facts would be wanted,-or to get at them even if she had known\nthat her success depended on their production on that day.\nMrs. Piper while in England was twice in Cambridge, twice ill\nLondon, and twice in Liverpool, at dates arranged by ourselves j her\nsitters (almost always introduced under false names) belonged to\nseveral quite different social groups, and were frequently unacquainted\nwith each other. Her correspondence was addressed to my care, and I\nbelieve that almost every letter which she received WIIS shown to one\nor other of us. When in London she stayed in lodgings which we\nselected j when at Liverpool, in Professor Lodge's house j and when at\nCambridge, in Professor Sidgwick's or my own. No one of her hosts,\nor of her hosts' wives, detected any suspicious act or word. \u2022\nWe took great pains to avoid giving information in talk j and a\nmore complete security is to be found in the fact that we were oUl'selves\nignorant of many of the facts given as to our friends' relations, &c. In\nthe case of Mrs. Verrall, for instance, (cited below,) no one in Cambridge\nexcept Mrs. Verrall herself could have supplied the bulk of the infor-\nmation given.; and some of the facts given (as will be seen) Mrs. Verrall\nherself did not know. As regards my own affairs, I have not thought\nit worth while to cite in exten8Q such statements as might possibly\nhl!ove been got up beforehand j since Mrs. Piper of course knew that I\nshould be one of her sitters. Such facts as that I once had an aunt,\n\"Cordelia Marshall, more commonly called Corrie,\" might have been\nlearnt,-though I do not think that they were learnt,-from printed or\nother sources. But I do not think that any larger proportion of such\naccessible facts was given to me than to an average sitter, previously\nunknown j nor were there any of those subtler points which could so\neasily have been made by dint of scrutiny of my books or papers. On\nthe other hand, in my case, as in the case of several other sitters, there\nwere messages purporting to come from a friend who has been dead\nmany years, and mentioning circumstances which I believe that it\nwould have been quite impossible for :Mrs. Piper to have discovered.\nI am also acquainted with some of the facts given to other sitters,\nand suppressed as too intimate, or as involving secrets not the property\nof the sitter alone. I may say that so far as my own personal con-\nviction goes, the utterance of olle or two of these facts is even more\nconclusive of supel'llonnal knowledge than the correct statement of\n\f440 A Record of Observations of\ndozens of names of relations, &c., which the sitter had no personal\nmotive for concealing.\nOn the whole, I believe that all observers, both in America and\nin England, who have seen enough of Mrs. Piper in both stateS to be\nable to form a judgment, will agree in affirming (1) that many of the\nfacts given could not have been learnt even by a skilled detective;\n(2) that to learn others of them, although possible, would have needed\nan expenditure of money as well as of time which it seems impossible\nto suppose that Mrs. Piper could have met; and (3) that her conduct;\nhas never given any ground whatever for supposing her capable of\nfraud or trickery. Few persons have been so long and so carefully\nobserved; and she has left on all observers the impression of thorough\nuprightness, candour, and honesty.\nLess than this it would not be fair to sn.y. But, on the other hand,\nit must be remembered that the personal honesty of Mrs. Piper, in the\nwaking state, covers only a part of our difficulties. We are dealing with\nan honest subject, and with a genuine trance; but it by no means\nfollows that the trance-personality is as honest as the waking one.\nAnalogy would be against such an assumption. It may be remembered\nthat in Mr. and Mrs. Newnham's case of thought-transference, mani-\nfested by planchette-writing,l the unconscious self of Mrs. Newnham,\nwhich in some way learnt the questions which Mr. Newnham was\nwriting down, exhibited at times a trickiness and a pretension to know-\nledge that it did not possess, which were quite foreign to Mrs.\nNewnham's conscious mind. With other automatic messages,-whether\n'Conveyed by table-tilting, planchette-writing, or onlinary Ilutomatic\nacript,-the case is much the same. Even though the messages may\nusually seem straightforward enough, times will come when the responses\ndegenerate,-when silly jokes, or manifest untruths, or violent expressiou-\nare written, perhaps, over and over again. This seems to go with\nfatigue in the automatist, and to show some want of co-ordination.\n1\\1rs. Piper's trance-condition is markedly subject to these forms of\ndegeneration. As will be more fully described later on, she passes with\nslight convulsions into a condition in which a personality calling itself\n\"Dr. Phinuit\" comes to the front. And\" Phinuit \"-to use his own\nappellation for brevity's sake-is by no means above\" fishing.\" His\nways of extracting information from the sitter, under the guise of giving\nit, will be described in detail by Mr. Leaf. Different trances, and\ndifferent parts of the same trance, varied greatly in quality. There were\nsome interviews throughout which Phinuit hardly asked any question,\nand hardly stated anything which was not true. There were others\nthroughout which his utterances showed not one glimmer of real know-\nledge, but consisted wholly of fishing questions and random assertions.\nI Phantalflll oj the Lil'inu, Vul. I., p. 63.\nDigitized by Google\n\fCertain Phenonunut of T1'a1U'e. 441\nThese trances cannot always be induced at pleasure. A state of\nquiet expectancy or \"self-suggestion\" will usually bring one on; but\nsometimes the attempt altogether fails. We never attempted to induce\nthe trance by hypnotism. I understand, indeed, that Mrs. Piper has\nnever been deeply hypnotised, although Professor Richet tried on her\nsome experiments of suggestion in the waking state, and found her\nsomewhat\" suggestible.\" On the other hand, the trance has occasionally\nappeared when it was not desired. The first time that it occurred,\n(as Mrs. Piper informs us,) it came as an unwelcome surprise. And\nMrs. Piper believes-our evidence lies in her own inference from her own\nsensations--that the access has several times come upon her\" during\nsleep, exhausting her for the succeeding day. An instance of this kind\noccurred at Cambridge. Before going to bed she had, at my request,\nand for the first time in her life, been looking into a crystal, with the\ndesire to see therein some hallucinatory figure which might throw light\non the nature of the mysterious secondary personality. She saw nothing;\nbut next morning she looked exhausted, and said tha.t she thought that\nshe had had an access during the night. The next time that she went\ninto a trance Phinuit said he had come and called, and no one had\nanswered him. It appeared as though the concentration of thought\nupon the crystal had acted as a kind of self-suggestion, and had induced\nthe secondary state, when not desired.\nThe trance when induced generally lasted about an hour. On one\noccasion in my house, and I believe once at least in Ameiica, it only\nlasted for about a minute. Phinuit only had time to say that he could\nnot remain, and then the habitual moaning began, and Mrs. Piper\ncame to herself.\nThere was often a marked difference between tho first few minutes\nof a trance and the remaining time. On such occasions almost all that\nwas of value would be told in the first few minutes; and the remaining\ntalk would consist of vague generalities or mere repetitions of what had\nalready been given. Phinuit, as will be seen, always professed himself\nto be a spirit communicating with spirits; and he used to say that he\nremembered their messages for a few minutes after \"entering into the\nmedium,\" and then became confused. He was not, however, apparently\nable to depart when his budget of facts was empty. There seemed to\nbe some irresponsible letting-off of energy which must continue until\nthe original impulse was lost in incoherence.\nWe shall endeavour to set forth our series of observations fully\nand fairly, giving as far as possible the actual view of each observer,\nand withholding no judgment of an unfavourable kind. We had\nat first hoped to have printed all our evidence in this Part of\nthe Proceedings; but Mr. Hodgson's collection of American testimony,\nwith account of medical examination, has been unavoidably delayed,\nDigitized by Google\n\f4402 A RecO'1'cl of Obse\u00b7rvatUm8 of\nand must be postponed to the next Part. Professor Lodge and\nMr. Leaf have given a full account of the English sittings, and\na paper by Professor William James, of Harvard University, con-\ncludes the batch of evidence which we can at present offer. It is\npossible that Mrs. Piper may visit England again, and we shall be glacl\nof any criticisms which may assist in the difficult task of giving stability\nand precision to these fleeting and often incoherent phenomena. But\neven as our evidence stands, the reader will thus have much material\nfrom which to form bis own opinion as to the origin of the know-\nledge,-some of it plainly acquired, I think, in some supernormal\nway,-which these trance-utterances show. But I would warn him\nagainst coming to any definite conclusion on the strength of this case\nalone. Phinuit's utterances must be judged, I think, as but one item\nin the long roll of Rutomatic messages of many kinds which are only\nnow beginning to be collected and analysed. I regard it as proved\nthat these phenomena afford evidence of large extensions-telepathic\nor clairvoyant-of. the normal powers of tbe human spirit. It is\npossible that Phinuit's knowledge is thus derived from a telepathic 01\u00b7\nclairvoyant faculty, latent in Mrs. Piper, and manifesting itself in\nways with whic.h previous experiment has not made us familiar. On tbe\nother hand, the wide class of \"automatic messages\" includes phenomena.\nof very various types, some of which certainly point primd facie to the'\nintervention,-perhaps the very indirect intervention,-of the surviving\npersonalities of the dead. If such instances of communication from\nextra-terrene minds should ultimately find acceptance with Scienct>t\nthen Phinuit's messages, with all their drawbacks, and all their incon.\nsistency, will have fair claim to be added to the number.\nDigitized by Google\n1\n\fOertain Phenomena of Trance. 443\n(2) PART I.\nBy PROFESSOR OLIVER LoDGE, F.R.S.\nAccount of ,itting, witT, Mr,. Piper.\nFORMAL REPORT.\nAt the request of Mr. Myers I undertook a share in the investiga.-\ntion of a case of apparent clairvoyance.\nIt is the case of a lady who appears to go oft'into a trance when she\npleases to will it under favourable sun-oundings, and in that trance to\ntalk volubly, with a manner and voice quite different from her ordinary\nma.nner and voice, 011 details concerning which she has had no\ninfonnation given her.\nIn this abnonnal state her speech has reference mainly to people's\nrelatives and friends, living or deceased, about whom she is able to hold\na conversation, and with whom she appears more or less familial'.\nBy introducing anonymous strangers, and by catechising her myself\nin \\\"arious ways, I have satisfied myself that much of the information\nshe possesses in the trance state is not acquired by ordinary common-\nplace methods, but that she has some unusual means of acquiring\ninfonnation. The facts on which she discourses are usually within the\nknowledge of some person present, though they are often entirely out\nof his conscious thought at the time. Occasionally facts have been\nnarrated which have only been verified afterwards, and which are in\ngood faith asserted never to ha\\'e been known; meaning thereby that\nthey have left no trace on the conscious memory of any person present\nor in the neighbourhood, and that it is highly improbable that they\nwere e\\\"er known to such persons.\nShe is also in the trance state able to diagnose diseases and to\nspecify the owners or late owners of portable property, under circum-\nstances which preclude the application of ordinary methods.\nIn the midst of this lucidity a number of mistaken and confused\nstatements are frequently made, having little or no apparent meaning\nor application.\nConcerning the particular means by which she acquires the different\nkinds of infonnation, there is no sufficient evidence to make it safe to\ndraw any conclusion. I can only say with certainty that it is by\nnone of the ordinary methods known to Physical Science.\nOLIVER J. LoDGE.\nMay, 1890.\nThe above careful statement doe'!! not convey any vivid idea of the\nactual occurrences, nor does it impa.rt such infonnation as is needed by\npersons not already familiar with the subject before they read the\nDigitized by Google\n\fA RecOl'd of Obse1'Vatwns of\ndetailed report; hellee it may be permissible to amplify it by a more\ndescriptive and less cautiously worded account of my experience,\naccompanied by a preliminary examination of such elucidatory hypo-\ntheses as suggest themselves; premising that for evidence the report of\nthe sittings must be appealed to, not this narrative account.\nRegarding the manner of the sitting, it may be convenient to print\nhere, as sufficiently representative of what happens, and as embodying\nwhat it is necessary somewhere to say concerning Mrs. Piper's initial\nacquaintance with me, a statement I wrote shortly after my first\nsitting.\nPrdimiltflr!llJtatement 11.\"ritten December 1st, 1889.\nMrs. Piper arrived in England on November 19th in the Cunard steamer\n&ythia from Boston, and as Mr. Myers was called away to Edinburgh on\nthat day, I met the steamer at his request and conveyed the lady to the\nhotel apartments he had taken for her.\nI was a complete stranger, but was introduced sufficiently by a note Mr.\nMyers had left with the hotel Commissionaire, who also met the steamer and\nsaw the luggage through the Custom House. In the course of the drive to\nthe hotel with }Irs. Piper and her two little girls, I mentioned that I had a.\ngood many children; in fact, seven. I also told her that I was a Professor at\na college in the city. At the hotel I left her, and though I called next day\njust to see that she was all right, I told her no more about myself, nor was\nshe in the least inquisitive. She was naturally tired after the journey, and\nabsorbed with the children. That evening Mr. Myers arrived, and next day\nescorted her to his house in Cambridge.\nI remained at work in Liverpool till November 29th, when I travelled to\nLondon to attend the Royal Society dinner the following day. And on the\nmorning of this day, the 30th, I met Mr. Myers at King's Cr088, and\ntravelled to Cambridge with him by the 9.5 a.m. train, reaching his house\nabout 11. ()Irs. Piper was soon ready and we commenced a sitting. I sat\nfacing Mrs':'1'ipcr in a partially darkened room, amI Mr. Myers was within\nearshot on the other side of curtains, taking note of what was said. Mrs.\nPiper sat still, leaning forward in her chair, and holding my hands. For\nsome time she could not go off, but at last she said, \"Oh, I am going,\" the\nclock happened to strike one (for a half hour), and she twitched convulsively,\nejaculated \"don't.,\" and went into apparent epilepsy. [I had seen epilepsy\nseveral times before and recognised many of the ordinary and obvious\nsymptoms; not, of course, pretending to speak medically.] Gradually she\nbecame quiet, and still holding my right hand, cleared her throat in a male\nvoice, and with distinctly altered and hardened features, eyes closed and un-\nused the whole time. Having been told what to expect and how to humour\nthis impersonation, I said, \"Well, Doctor,\" upon which he [for it sounded like\na man, and I quite forgot that it was a woman who was speaking for the rest\nof the sitting: the whole manner and conversation was masculine] introduced\nhimself as \"Dr. Phinuit,\" and we made the usual commonplace remarks.\nI found it difficult to know what to say, but I said I had heard of him from\nMyers, and he said, .. Ha ! Myers, is he here 1 He wasn't here last time I\ncame,\" upon whic Mr. Myers replied, \"Yell, I am here, Doctor.\" He Raid\nDigitized by Google\n\fOe,1,ain Phenomena of Tmnce. 445\na few more words to Mr. Myers, and then asked me if there was anything 1\nwanted to ask him, at the same time putting his hand on my head and\nfeeling all over it, saying he wanted to become acquainted with me, that 1 was\n\" a nice fellow,\" \"worked too hard,\" \"had a full head,\" and such like\nthings, as he probably would say to anyone engaged in similar pursuits. 'I\nasked him if he could tell me anything about my relatiollB, upon which he\nbegan a rambling and excited conversation consisting of short sentences and\ncuriou'i snatches and jerks, with occasional wanderings into momentary\n(apP.l\"'ent) irrelevance, but every now and again coming to a point\nenergetically and hammering it into me with insistence both verbal and\nmanual) Of this conversation Mr. Myers took as complete notes as was\npossible, and 1 have not been able to supplement his notes very materially,\nexcept perhaps here and there with a touch which had escaped him.\nThe occasional irrelevance faintly coming in every now and then amid\nthe more COllBtant coherent and vigorous communication, reminded ma\nof listening ata telephone, where, wheneveryour main correspondent is silent,\nyou hear the dim and meaningless fragments of a city's gOBBip, till back again\ncomes the voice obviously addressed to you and speaking with firmness and\ndecision.\nThe record follows later (p. 465). The details given of my family are just\nsuch as one might imagine obtained by a perfect stranger surrounded by\nthe whole of one's relations in a group and able to converse freely but hastily\nwith one after the other; not knowing them and being mther confused with\ntheir number and half-understood messages and personalities, and having a\nspecial eye to their physical weaknesses I;IDd defects. A person in a hurry thus\ntrying to tell a stranger as much about his friends as he could in this way\ngather would seem to me to be likely to make much the same kind of com-\nmunication as was actually made to me.\nIn order to gain further experience, my wife invited Mrs. Piper to\nour house between the dates December 18th and December 27th, 1889;\nand again between the dates January 30th and February 5th, 1890,\nwhen she sailed for New York.\nDuring these days we had 22 sittings, and I devoted my whole time\nto the business, being desirous of making the investigation as complete\nand satisfactory as possible while the opportunity lasted.\nMrs. Piper pretends to no knowledge as to her own powers, and\nI believe her assertion that she is absolutely ignorant of all that she\nhas said in the trance state. She appears to be anxious to get the\nphenomenon elucidated, and hopes by sitting to scientific investigators\nto have light thrown on her abnormal condition, about which she\nexpresses herself as not quite comfortable. She perfectly appreciates\nthe reasonableness of withholding information from her; assents with\n0. smile to a sudden stop in the middle of a sentence, and in general\nis quite uninquisitive. All this innocency may, of course, be taken\nas perfection of acting, but it deprives hel' of the great advantage\n(assuming fraudulent intention for the moment) of controlling the\ncircumstances after the manner of a conjurer; and prevents her from\n2 I\nDigitized by Google\n\f446 A Rec01'cl of Ob8e)'I:atio'n8 of\nbeing the master of her own time and movements. The control of the\nexperiments was thus entirely in my own hands, and this is an essential\ningredient for satisfactory testimony.\nThe initial question to be satisfactorily answered before anything\ncan be held worth either investigating or recording COnCel'llS the\nhonesty of ~Irs. Piper herself.\nThat there is more than can be explained by any amount of either\nconscious or unconscious fraud, that the phenomenon is a genuine\none however it is to be explained, I now regard as absolutely certain ;\nand I make the following two statements with the utmost confidence :-\n(i.) Mrs. Piper's attitude is not one of deception.\n(ii.) No conceivable deception on the part of Mrs. Piper can explain\nthe facts.\nr I will not take up time by doing more than enumerating some of the\n>\n~ethods of imposture which suggest themselves to an inquirer as\npreliminary possibilities to be guarded against. Such as :-\nInquiry by paid agents.\nInquiry by correspondence.\nCatechism of servants or children.\nResearch in Family Bibles.\nStudy of photograph albums.\nUse of directories and biographies.\nProwling about the house at night with skeleton keys.\nBribing servants to name the sitter.}\nThe question of good faith is so vital that before taking leave of\nthis part of the subject I will make the following statements :-\n1. Mrs. Piper's correspondence was small, something like three letters\na. week, even when the children were away from her. The outsides of\nher letters nearly always passed through my hands, and often the\ninsides, too, by her permission.\n2. The servants were all, as it happened, new, having been obtained\nby my wife through ordinary local inquiries and registry offices, just\nabout the time of Mrs. Piper's visit. Consequently they were entirely\nignorant of family connections, and could have told nothing, however\nlargely they had been paid.\nThe ingenious suggestion has been made that they were her spies.\nKnowing the facts, I will content myself with asserting that they.had\nabsolutely no connection with her of any sort. \"\n3. The photograph albums and Family Bibles were hidden by me\nthe morning of the day after she arrived at my house. I had intended\nto do it sooner. This is manifestly a weak point. Like many such\nthings, it sounds worse than it is. The more important books were in\nmy study, and into it she did not go till just before the first sitting.\nDigitized by Google\n\fCe\u00b7rtain Phenomena of Tm'llce. 447\nOne or two photographs she did look at, and these are noted. The\nsafest thing is to assume that she may have looked at everything about\nthe house.\n4. In order to be able to give better evidence, I obtained permission\nand immediately thereafter personally overhauled the whole of her\nluggage. Directories, biographies, Men of the Time, and such-like\nbooks were entirely absent. In fact there were scarcely any books\n4't all. .\n5. The eldest child at home was aged nine, and the amount of\ninformation at his disposal was fairly well known to us. My wife was\nsceptically inclined, and was guarded in her utterances; and though a\nfew slips could hardly be avoided-a.nd one or two of these were rather\nunlucky ones-they were noted and are recorded.\n6. Strange sitters frequently arrived at 11 a.m., and I admitted\nthem myself straight into the room where we were going to sit; they\nwere shortly afterwards introduced to Mrs. Piper under some assumed\nname.\n7. Occasionally, when the sitter came in an evening and took a\nmeal first, the correct name was apt to leak out. Even then it seems to\nme that a portentous and impossible memory would be needed to select\nfrom the entire mass of facts which had been previously (by impossible\nhypothesis) hunted up and memorialised for the circle of my and many\nother people's acquaintance, and to affix the correct parcel to the\nappropriate individual.\nS. The whole attitude of Mrs. Pipel' was natural, uninquisitive,\nladylike, and straightforward. If anything was noticeable it was a\ntrace of languor and self-absorption, very natural under the trying\ncondition of two long trances a day.\nHer whole demeanour struck everyone who became intimate with\nher as utterly beyond and above suspicion.\n9. The trance is, to the best of my belief, a genuine one. In it\nMrs. Piper is (sometimes, at. least,) insensible to pain, as tested by\nsuddenly pushing a needle into her hand, which causes not the slightest\nflinching; and her pulse is affected beyond what I can imagine to\nbe the control of volition. Of the genuineness of the trance I have\nnot the remotest doubt, and only say no m.ore about it because it is\na question for medical witnesses (p. 441).\n(bbeating being supposed out of the questioll, and something which\nmay briefly be described, at least by a non-psychologist, as a duplex\nor trallce personality being conceded, the next hypothesis is that her\ntrance pel'sonality makes use of information acquired by her in her\nwaking state, and retails what),t finds in her sub-consciousness without\nany ordinary effort of memory.)\n2 I 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f448 A &emu of Observati<n\/,8 of\nIt is an interesting question whether any facts instilled into the\nwaking Mrs. Piper can be recognised in the subsequent trance speech\nMy impression at one time was that the trance information is practically\nindependent of what specific facts Mrs. Piper may happen to know.\nThe evidence now seems to me about evenly balanced on either side.\n\\Vhether the trance speech could give, say, scientific facts, or a foreign\nlanguage, or anything in its nature entirely beyond her ken, I am\nunable to say. Definite experiments may have, and I hope have, been\ndirected to each of these questions, but not yet by me. I want to\nattack these questions next time I have a chance.( So far as my present\nexperience has gone, I do not feel sure how far Mrs. Piper's knowledge\nor ignorance of specific facts has an appreciable influence on the com-\nmunication of her trance personality. But certainly the great mass\nof facts retailed by this personality are wholly outside of ?tIrs. Piper's\nknowledge; in detail, though not in kind.\nThe personality active and speaking in the trance i.. apparently s()\ndistinct from the personality of Mrs. Piper that it is permissible and\nconvenient to call it by another name. It does not differ from her as.\nHyde did from Jekyll, by being a personification of the vicious portion\nof the same individual. There is no special contrast, any more than\nthere is any special similarity. It strikes one as a different personality\naltogether, and the name by which it introduces itself when asked, viz.,\n\" Dr. Phinuit,\" is as convenient as any other, and can be used wholly\nirrespective of hypothesis. \\\nI would not in using tlii's name be understood as thereby committing\nmyself to any hypothesis regarding the nature o~this. apparently distinct\nand individual mind. At the same time \\the name is useful as\nexpressing compactly what is naturally prominent to the feeling of any\nsitter, that he is not talking to Mrs. Piper at all. The manner, mode\nof thought, tone, trains of idea, are all different. You are speaking\nno longer to a lady but to a man, an old man, a medical man. All this\ncannot but be vividly felt even by one who considered the\u00b7 impersona-\ntion a consummate piece of acting.)\nWhether such a man as Dr. Phinuit ever existed I do not know,\nnor from the evidential point of view do I greatly care. It will be\ninteresting to have the fact ascertained if possible; but I cannot see\nthat it will much affect the question of genuineness. For that he did\nnot ever exist is a thing practically impossible to prove. While, if he\ndid exist, it can be easily supposed that Mrs. Piper took care enough\nthat her impersonation should have so much rational basis (p. 520).\nIt can be objected, why if he was a French doctor has he so entirely\nforgotten his French 1 For though he speaks in a Frenchified manner, I\nam told that he cannot sustain a conversation in that language. I am\nunable to meet this objection, by anything beyond the obvious suggcs-\nDigitized by Google\n\fCertain, PhertO'YY\/..e'fW, of Trance. 440\ntion that Mrs. Piper's brain is the medium utilised, and that she is like-\nwise ignorant. But one would think that it would be a sufficiently\npatent objection to deter an impersonator from assuming a r6le of purely\nunnecessary difficulty, and one which it was impossible satisfactorily to\nmaintain.\n(Admitting, however, that\" Dr. Phinuit\" is probably a mere name\nfor Mrs. Piper's secondary consciousness, one cannot help being struck\nby the singular correctness of his medical diagnoses. In fact the\nmedical statements, coinciding as they do with truth just as well as\nthose of a regular physician, but given without any ordinary examina-\ntion and sometimes without even seeing the patient, must be held as\npart of the evidence establishing a strong primd facie case for the\nexistence of some abnormal means of acquiring information.) Not that\nit is to be supposed that he is more infallible than another. I have\none definite case of distinct error in a diagnosis (p. 547).\nProceeding now on the assumption that I may speak henceforth of Dr.\nPhinuit as of a genuine individual intelligence, whether it be a usually\nJatent portion of Mrs. Piper's intelligence, or whether it be something\ndistinct from her mind and the education to which it has been\nsubjected, I go on to consider the hypotheses which still remain un-\nexamined.\nAnd first~we have the hypothesis of fishery on the part of Dr.\nPhinuit, as distinguished from trickery on the part of Mrs. Piper~ I\nmean a system of ingenious fishing (the utilisation of trivial\nindications, of every intimation, audible, tactile, muscular, and of\nlittle shades of ~anner too indefinable to name; all these excited in\nthe sitter by skilful guesses and well-directed shots, and their nutri-\nment extracted with superhuman cunning.\nNow this hypothesis is not one to be lightly regarded, or ever wholly\nset aside. I regard it as, to a certain extent, a vera causa. At times\nDr. Phinuit does fish. Occasionally he guesses; and somet.imes he ekes\nout the scantiness of his information from the resources of a lively\nimagination.\nWhenever his supply of information is ahundant there is no sign\nof the fishing process.\nAt other times it is as if he were in a difficult position,-only able\nto gain information from very indistinct or inaudible sources, and yet\nwishful to convey as much information as possible. The attitude is\nthen as of one straining after every clue, and making use of the\nslightest indication, whether received in normal or abnormal ways: not\nindeed obviously distinguishing between information received from\nthe sitter and information received from other sources.\nThe fishing process is most marked when Mrs. Piper herself\neither is not feeling well or is tired. Dr. Phinuit seems to experience\n\f450 A Beem'll of Obse1-vatimUl of\nmore difficulty then in obtaining information; and when he does not\nfish he simply draws upon his memory and retails old facts which he\nhas told before, occasionally with additions of his own which do not\nimprove them. His memory seems to be one of extraordinary tenacity\na.nd exactness, but not of infallibility; and its lapses do introduce\nerror, both of defect and excess.)\nlIe seems to be under some compulsion not to be silent. Possibly\nthe trance would cease if he did not exert himself. At any rate he\nchatters on, and one has to discount a good deal of conversation which\nis obviously, and sometimes confessedly, introduced as a stop-gap.\n\"He is rather proud of his skill, and does not like to be told he is\nwrong; but when he waxes confidential he admits that he is not\ninfallible: \"he does the best he can,\" he says, but sometimes \"every-\nthing seems dark to him,\" and then he flounders and gropes, and\nmakes mistakes.)\nIt is not to he supposed that this floundering is always most con-\nspicuous in presence of a stranger. On the contrary, if he is in good\nform he will rattle off a stranger's connections pretty glibly, being in-\ndeed sometimes oppressed with the rush and volume of the information\navailable; while, if he is in bad trim, he will fish and retail stale news\n(especially the latter) to quite an old hand, and one who does not scruple\nto accuse him of his delinquencies when they become conspicuous.\nThis fallibility is unfortunatt', but I don't know that we should\nexpect anything else; anyhow it is not a question of what we expect,\nbut of what wt' get. If it were a question of what I for one had\nexpected, the statement of it would not be worth the w.riting.\nPersonally I feel sure that Phinuit can hardly help this fishing\nprocess at timt's. He does the best he can, but it would be a great\nimprovement if, when he realises that conditions are unfavourable, he\nwould say so and hold his peace. I have tried to impress this upon\nhim, with the effect that he is sometimes confidential, and says that he\nis having a bad time; but after all he probably knows his o\\\"n busi-\nness best, because it has several times happened that after half an hour\nof more or less worthless padding, a few minutes of valuable lucidity\nhave been attained.\nI have laid much stress upon this fishery hypothesis because it is a.\nfact to be taken into consideration, because it i'! occasionally an un-\nfortunately conspicuous fact, and because of it.'! deterrent effect on a\nnovice to whom that aspect is first exposed.\nBut in thus laying stress I feel that I am producing an erroneous\nand misleading impression of proportion. I have spoken of a few minutes'\nlucidity to an intolerable deal of padding as an occasional experience, bui\nin the majority of the sittings held in my presence the converse propor-\ntion better represents tho facts.\nDigitized by Google\n\fCeri((in Phenomena of Tmnce. 451\n( I am familiar with muscle-reading and other simulated \"thought-\ntransference\" methods, and prefer to avoid contact whenever it is\npossible to get rid of it without too much fuss. Although Mrs. Piper\nalways held somebody's hand while preparing to go into the trance,\nshe did not always continue to hold it when speaking as Phinuit) She\ndid usually hold the hand of the person she was speaking to, but was\noften satisfied for a time with some other person's, sometimes talking\nright across a room to and a.bout a stranger, but preferring them to\ncome near. (On several occasions she let go of everybody, for half-hours\ntogether, especially when fluent and kept well supplied with\" relics.\"\nI ha.ve now to assert with entil\u00b7e confidence that, pressing the\ningenious-guessing and unconscious-indication hypothesis to its utmost\nlimit, it can only be held to account for a very few of Dr. Phinuit's\nstatements.\nIt cannot in all cases be held to account for medical diagnoses,\nafterwards confirmed by the regular practitioner.\nIt cannot account for minute and full details of names, circumstances,\nand events, given to a cautious and almost silent sitter, sometimes with-\nout contact. And, to take the strongest case at once, it cannot account\nfor the narration of facts outside the conscious knowledge of the sitter\nor of any pet\u00b7son present.\nRejecting the fishery hypothesis, then, as insufficient to account\nfor many of the facts, we are driven to the only remaining known\ncause in order to account for them :-viz., thought-transference, or\nthe action of mind on mind independently of the ordinary channels of\ncommunication)Whether \"thought-transference \" be a correct term\nto apply to the process I do not pretend to decide. That is a question\nfor psychologists. V\nIt may be \u00a3thin the reader's knowledge that I regard thc fact\nof genuine \"thought-transference\" between persons in immediate\nproximity (not necessarily in contact) as having been established\nby direct and simple experiment; and, except by reason of paucity\nof instance, I. consider it as firmly grounded as any of the less familiar\nfacts of nature such as one deals with in a laboratory. (Proceedings\nS.P.R., Vol. II, p. 189).\nI speak of it therefore as a known cause, i.e., one to which there\nneed be no hesitation in appealing in order to explain facts which\nwithout it would be inexplicable.\nThe Phinuit fncts are most of them of this nature, and I do not\nhesitate to asscrt confidently that tllOugltt-tmltsje1\u00b7ence is tlte most\ncommonplace e.~plan(!tion to tv!tic\/~ it is 1108sible to appeal.\nI regard it as having been rigorously proved before, and as therefore\nrequiring no fresh bolstering up; but to the many who have not made\nexperiments on the subject, and are therefore naturally sceptical\nDigitized by Google\n\f452 A Recont of Obse1'Vut'i0'n8 of\nconcerning even thought-transference, the record of the Phinuit sittings\nwill afford, I think, a secure basis for faith in this immaterial mode of\ncommunication,-this apparently direct action of mind on mind.\nBut, whereas the kind of thought-transference which had been to\nmy own knowledge experimentally proved was a hazy and difficult\nrecognition by one person of objects kept as vividly as possible in the\nconsciousness of another person, the kind of thought-transference\nnecessary to explain these sittings is of an altogether freer and higher\norder,-a kind which bas not yet been experimelltally proved at\nall. Facts are related wbich are not in the least present to the\nconsciousness of the sitter, and they are often detailed glibly and\nvividly without delay; in very different style from the tedious and\nhesitating dimness of the percipients in the old thought-transference\nexperiments.\nBut that is natural enough, when we consider that the percipient\nin those experiments had to preserve a mind as vacant as possible.\nFor no process of inducing mental vacancy can be so perfect as that of\ngoing into a trance, whether hypnotic or other.\nMoreover, although it was considered desirable to maintain the\nobject contemplated in the consciousness of the agent, a shrewd\nsuspicion was even then entertained that the unconscious part of the\nagent's brain might be perhaps equally effective.\nHellce Olle is at liberty to apply to these Phinuit records the hypo-\nthesis of thought-transference ill its most developed state: absolute\nvacuity on the part of the percipient, acted Oll by an entirely sub-con-\nscious or ullconscious portion of the sitter's brain.\nIn this form one feels that much can be explained. If Dr. Phinuit\ntells one how mallY children, or brothers, or sisters one has, and their\nnames; the names of father and mother and grandmother, of cousins and\nof aunts; if he brings appropriate and characteristic messages from\nwell-known relatives deceased; all this is explicable on the hypothesis\nof free and easy thought-transference from the sub-consciousness of the\nsitter to the sensitive medium of the trance personality.l\nSo strongly was I impressed with this view that after some half-\ndozen sittings I ceased to feel much interest in being told things,\nhowever minute, obscure, and inaccessible they might be, so long as\nthey were, or had been, withill the knowledge either of ~yself or of\nthe sitter for the time being. ~\n1 For inRtance, in the coul'lle of my intenie\\vs, all my six brothers ~ult and\nBCattered) and one sister living were correctly named (two with some help), and the\nexisttlnoo of the one deoeased was mAntioned. My father and his father \\Vere likewill8\nnamed, with several uncles and aunts. My wife's father and stepfather were named\nin full, both Christian and 8umame, with full identifying detail. I only quote these\nas examples; it is quite unnecessary as well as unwise to attach any evidential weight\nto statements of this sort made during a sojoum in one's house.\nDigitized by Google\n\fl\nOertain Phenomena of Tm-nce. 45~\nAt the same time it ought to be constantly borne in mind that\nthis kind of thought-transference without consciously active agency\nhas never been experimentally proved. Certain facts not otherwise\napparently explicable, such as. those chronicled in PIumta8m8 of tI,e\nLiving, have suggested it, but it is really only a possible hypothesis\nto which appeal has been made whenever any other explanation seems\nout of the question. But until it is actua.Uy established by experiment\nin the same way that conscious mind action has been established, it\ncannot be regarded as either safe or satisfactory; and in pursuing it\nwe may be turning our backs on some truer but as yet perhaps\nunsuggested clue. I feel as if this caution were necessary for myself as\nwell as for other members of the Society. .\nOn reading the record it will be apparent that ~hile \" Phinuit \"\nfrequently speaks in his own person, relating things which he himself\ndiscovers by what I suppose we must call ostensible clairvoyance, some-\ntimes he represents himself as in communication-not always quite\neasy and distinct communication, especially at first, but in communica-\ntion-with one's relatives and friends who have departed this life.\nThe messages and communications from these persons are usually\ngiven through Phinuit as a reporter. And he reports sometimes in the\nthird person, sometimes in the first. Occasionally, but very seldom,\nPhinuit seems to give up his place altogether to the other personality,\nfriend or relative, who then communicates with something of his old\nmanner and individuality; becoming often impressive and realist.i=.J\nThis last I say is rare, but with one or two personages it occurs,\nsubject to reservations to be mentioned directly; and when it does,\nPhinuit does not appear to know what has been said. It is quite as\nif he in his turn evacuated the body, just as Mrs. Piper had done,\nwhile a third personality utilises it for a time. The voice and mode of\naddress are once more changed, and more or less recall the voice and\nmanner of the person represented as communicating.\nThe communications thus obtained, though they show traces of the\nindividuality of the person represented as speaking, are frequently\nvulgarised; and the speeches are more commonplace, and so to say\ncheaper, than what one would suppose likely from the person himself.\nIt can, of course, be suggested that the necessity of working through the\nbrain of a person not highly educated may easily be supposed capable of\ndulling the edge of refinement, and of rendering messages on a.bstruse\nsubjects impossible.\nAmong sitters, I may mention Gerald Rendall, late of Trinity\nCollege, Cambridge, Principal of University College, Liverpool. He\nwas introduced as Mr. Roberts, and a sitting was immedia.tely com-\nmenced. The names of his brothers were all given correctly at this or\nDigitized by Google\n\f4540 A ReCQ\/'d of Obse?'Vat'ions of\nat the evening sitting of the same day, with many specific details which\nwere correct.\nHe brought with him a locket, and received communications and\nl'eminiscences purporting to come from the deceased friend whom it.\ncommemorated, some of them at present incompletely verified by reason\nof absence of persons in America, some of them apparently incorrect.\nbut those facts which he knew correctly stated in such a way as to\nsatisfy him that chance guessing and all other commonplace surmises\nwere absurdly out of the question. (Sittings 37 and 38.)\nAnother sitter was E. C. K. Gonner, Lecturer on Economics at\nUniversity College, Liverpool, mtroduced as Mr. McCunn, a.nother\ncolleague with whom he hoped to be confused. He brought a book\nbelonging to his mother, still living in London, and had many correct\ndetails concerning her family and surroundings related to him.\nMany of his own family were also mentioned; but, whether because\nof the book or otherwise, his mother's influence seemed more powerful\nthan his own; and, several times, relath'es, though otherwise spoken of\ncorrectly, were mentioned in terms of their relationship to the elder\ngeneration. Phinuit, however, seemed conscious of these mistakes and\nseveral times corrected himself; as for instance: Your brother William-\nno, I mean your uncle, her brother.\nThis Uncle WiIliam was a good instance. He had died before Gonner\nwas born, but he had been his mother's eldest brother, and his\nsudden death had been a great shock to her\u00b7-one in fact from which she\nwas a. long time recovering. Phinuit described him as having been killed\nwith a hole in his head, like a shot hole, and yet not a shot, more like\na blow :-the fact being that he met his death in a Yorkshire election\nriot, a stone striking him on the head. (Sitting No. 39, p. 490.)\nSpeaking of deaths, I may also mention the case of my wife's father\nwho died when she was a fortnight old in a dramatic and pathetic\nfashion. Phinuit described the circumstances of his death rather vividly.\nThe cause of death of her stepfather also, which was perfectly definite,\nwas also precisely grasped. The fall of her own father down. the hold\nof his ship and his consequent leg-pain were clearly stated. My wife\nwas present on these occasions, and of course had been told of all these\nincidents, and l'Cmembered them. (Sitting No. 36, pp. 4;2, &c.)\nAnother sitter was a medical practitioner in Liyerpool, introduced\nanonymously, who was told a number of facts, not all of them correct;\nbut the name, tastes, and defect of one little deaf and dumb girl of\nwhom he is very fond were vividly stated. My childl'Cn are not\nacquainted with his. (Sittings 42 and 43.)\nAnother, a very impromptu and in<-'Onvenient sitter, was a short-\nhand clerk whom I had introduced as a note-taker, but whose relatives\nwere represented as clamouring for a conversation with him; and I\nDigitized by Google\n\fCe?1(tin Phenomena of Tmnce. 455\nmust needs be tumed out of the room while Phinuit \"straightened\nout,\" as he called it, the young fellow's connections. A fair part ot\nwhat was said is perfectly true, so he says, but other parts he either\ndenies or is unable to verify. (Sitting 48, p. 519.)\nOne of the best sitters was my next-door neighbour, Isaac C_\nThompson, F.L.S., to whose name indeed, before he had been in any\nway introduced, Phinuit sent a message purporting to come from his\nfather. Three generations of his and of his wife's family living and\ndead (small and compact Quaker families) were, in the course of two or\nthree sittings, conspicuously mentioned, with identifying detail; the\nmain informant representing himself as his deceased brother, a young\nEdinburgh doctor, whose loss had been mourned some 20 years ago.\nThe familiarity and touchingness of the messages communicated in this\nparticular instance were very remarkable, and can by no means be\nreproduced in any printed report of the sitting. (Nos. 45, 50, 80.\n81, and 83.)\nTheir case is one in which very few mistakes were made, the details\nstanding out vividly correct, so that in fact they found it impossible\nnot to believe that their relatives were actually speaking to them.\nThis may sound absurd, but it correctly represents the impression pro-\nduced by a favourable series of sittings, and it is for that reason I\nmention it now.\nSimple events occurring elsewhere during the sitting were also\ndetected by Dr. Phinuit in their case, better than in any other I know\nof. (For instance, the \"rings\" episode, on p. 546.)\nAnother rather remarkable case arrived towards the end of my\nseries of sittings, when this friend of mine was present. A message\ninterpolated itself to a gentleman living in Liverpool, known, but not at\nall intimately known, to both of us, and certainly outside of OUI'\nthoughts-the head of the Liverpool Post-office, :Mr. Rich. The\nmessage purported to be from a son of his who had died suddenly a few\nmonths ago, and whom I had never seen; though my friend had, it\nseems, once or twice spoken to him.\nHe addressed my friend by name and besought him to conyey II\nmessage to his father, who, he said, was much stlicken by the blow,\nand who was suffeling from a recent occasional dizziness in his head,\nso that he felt afraid he should have to retire from business. Othel-\nlittle things were mentioned of an identifying character; and the\nmessage was, a few days later, duly conveyed. The facts stated were\nadmitted to be accurate; and the father, though naturally inclined to\nbe sceptical, confessed that he had indeed been more than ordinarily\ntroubled at the sudden death of his eldest son, because of a recent.\nunfortunate estrangement between them which would otherwise have\nbeen only temporary.\n\f456 .A Record of Observations of\nThe only thought-transference explanation I can reasonably offer\nhim is that it was the activity of his own mind, operating on the sensitive\nbrain of the medium, of whose existence he knew absolutely nothing,\n.and contriving to send a delusive message to itself!\nOne thing about which the son seemed anxious was a certain black\n~ which he asked us to speak to his father about, and to say he did\nnot want lost. The father did not know what case was meant: but I\nhave heard since indirectly that on his death-bed the son was calling out\n.about a black case, though I cannot learn that the particular case has\nbeen yet securely identified. (No. 83, p 554.)\nContemplating these and such like communications, I could not help\nf~ling that if it be really a case of thought-transference at all, it is\nthought-transference of a surprisingly vivid kind, the proof of which\nwould be very valuable, supposing it were the correct explanation of the\nphenomenon.\nBut I felt doubtful if it were the correct explanation. One must not\n.shut one's eyes to the ponibilitll that in pursuing a favourite hypothesis\n-one may after all be on the wrong tack altogether.\nA known hypothesis must be stretched to the utmost before one is\nwilling to admit an unknown one: and indeed to abandon this last\nknown link of causation as inadequate to sustain the growing weight\n-of facts was an operation not to be lightly undertaken. And yet I felt\n,grave doubts whether it would really suffice to explain the fact.s;\nwhether indeed it went any distance toward their explanation.\nThings were sometimes told to me and to others so entirely foreign\nto our conscious thought that at first they were not recognised as true\nor intelligible, and only gradually or by subsequent explanation was the\nmeaning clearly perceived.\nBut something of the same experience is gone through in dreams ;\none sometimes feels surprised at the tum IL dream conversation is\ntaking, and has the feeling also occasionally of learning something new.\nHence this argument is not of much strength taken alone.\nAnother argument bases itself on the mistakes which Dr. Phinuit\nsometimes unaccountably made. One noteworthy instance is called\nattention to by one of my sitters, whose father, in the midst of\nmuch that was correct and striking, was reported as saying that his\nname was John. Now his son, the sitter, was '\\ividly conscious that\nhis deceased father's name was not John, but was Peter. No know-\nledge of this, however, was shown by Phinuit; though, 1?y subsequently\nseyeral times quoting the name as Thomas, he seemed to show con-\nsciousness that there had been an error somewhere. (Sitting 39.)\nThe only explanation of this that I can suggest, beyond mere bungle\nand error, is that I was in the room also taking notes, and though I of\ncourse knew the surname, I was quite ignorant of the Christian name.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOe1'iain Phenomena of Trance. 451\nand was naturally as well satisfied with John or Thomas as with any-\nthing else. I simply recorded all that was said in a quite unbiassed\nmanner.\nConceivably, therefore, the trance-person may, for that item or\ninformation, have been reading my brain instead of the sitter's; but a-\nmass of other facts were given, known to him and not at all known to\nme; so that, as I say, the hypothesis of thought-transference has to be\nwriggled and stretched a little.\nHowever, I was willing to stretch it to any required length, ~\nlong as it would not actually snap. But feeling that it did not really\ncommend itself, I endeavoured to apply some crucial tests.\nAnd the first was a few children's alphabet letters, pinched up at ran-\ndom, put in a pill box without looking, and sealed by me in the presence\nof Prof. Carey Foster a month or so previously. This box I now handed\nto \"Dr. Phinuit\" and asked him what was inside it, telling him at the\nsame time that no one on earth knew, and requesting him to do his best.\nHe immediately asked for a pencil, and holding the box to his\nforehead, shaking it a little at intervals, as if to disentangle the contents\nand bring them more clearly before him, wrote down some letters on a-\nbit of cardboard held for him.\nI thanked him, and next morning, for better security, asked him to\ntry again. He did, and wrote down just the same letters, even to the\nextent of saying which way they happened to face in the box.\nI wrote two accounts of the contents of the box, one to Mr. Myers\nand one to Prof. Carey Foster, under seal, telegraphing to him to know\nif he were at home and ready to receive the box, assure himself that it\nhad not been tampered with (though indeed it had not been out of my\npossession all the time), and then to open it and write out the letters\nand their aspects, in full detail, before opening my sealed account.\nHe replied, \"Yes,\" and I sent him the box registered and insured.\nAll the letters were wrong but two.\nAccording to chance, if they had been pinched from a single\nalphabet, two should have been guessed right. The box from which\nthey had been pinched contained many alphabets, but practically the\nconclusion of the experiment was utterly negative. The letters had\nnot been read. (Sitting No. 40, p. 493.)\nThis experiment inclined me strongly to some thought-transference\nexplanation, as distinct from what seemed to me the more unknown and\n,\"ague region of clairvoyanQe.\nIf the letters themselves could be really directly perceived, the fact\nthat they existed in nobody's mind could not matter. But if mindB\nonly could be read, then it was essential that someone somewhere should\nbe cognisant of the letters.\nI do not mean that it would do to base so clear a conclusion on the\nDigitized by Google\n\f458 A Record of Observations of\nresult of one negative experiment. It is an experiment which I want\nto repeat again and again; though Phinuit doesn't much care for this\nkind of thing, and says it strains him.\nIf the experiment had succeeded it would have established clair-\nvoyance: whatever that may mean. I am unable to grasp its meaning.\nIt seems to me a violent hypothesis and last resort, and I do not feel\ndriven to it yet.\nI have also handed to \"Dr. Phinuit\" epistles, which I had read\nindeed but forgotten; and one of these was partially read. [po 335.\nSitting No. 78.] He does not profess to be good at this sort of thing;\nand usually fails, at least in my experience, to give more than a vague\nand unsatisfactory general resume of the subject matter-too vague to\nbe of any evidential use. I have not, however, tried this kind of experi-\nment often, finding that it apparently exhausts the power uselessly.\nAll this seemed to me to strengthen the hypothesis of thought-trans-\nference so far as it went.\nSo I set to work to try and obtain, by the regular process of com-\nmunication which suits this particular medium, facts which were not\nonly out of my knowledge but which never could have been in it.\nUnfortunately, in giving an account of these experiments, it is\nnecessary to mention occasionally trivial details concerning one's rela-\ntions which would ordinarily be inconsequential or even impertinent.\nThe occasion is the excuse.\nIt happens that an uncle of mine in London, now quite an old man,\nand one of a surviving three out of a very large family, had a twin\nbrother who died some twenty or more years ago. I interested him\ngenerally in the subject, and wrote to ask if he would lend me some\nrelic of this brother. By morning post on a certain day I received a.\nc;urious old gold watch, which this brother had worn and been fond of ;\nand that same morning, no one in the house having seen it or knowing\nanything about it, I handed it to Mrs. Piper when in a state of trance.\nI was told almost immediately that it had belonged to one of my\nuncles--one that had been mentioned before as having died from the\neffects of a fall-one that had been very fond of Uncle Robert, the\nname of the survivor-that the watch was now in possession of this\nsame Uncle Robert, with whom he was anxious to communicate. After\nsome difficulty and many wrong attempts Dr. Phinuit caught the name,\n.Jerry, short for Jeremiah, and said emphatically, as if a third person was\nspeaking, \"This is my watch, and Rober~ is my brother, and I am\nhere. Uncle Jerry, my watch.\" All this at the tirst sitting on the\nvery morning the watch had arrived by post, no one but myself and\na shorthand clerk who happened to have been introduced for the first\ntime at this sitting by me, and whose antecedents are well known\nto me, Leing present. (No. 44.)\nDigitized by Goo~\n\fOertain Phenornena of Tl'(lnce. 459\nHaying thus ostensibly got into communication through some lUeans\nor other with what purported to be a deceased relatiYe, whom I had\nindeed known slightly in his later years of blindness, but of whose early\nlife I knew nothing, I pointed out to him that to make Unc]a Robert\naware of his presence it would be well to recall trivial details of their\nboyhood, all of which I would faithfully report.\nHe quite caught the idea., and proceeded during several successive\nsittings ostensibly to instruct Dr. Phinuit to mention a number of little\nthings such as would enable his brother to recognise him.\nReferences to his blindness, illness, and main facts of his life were\ncomparatively useless from my point of view; but these details of boy-\nhood, two-thirds of a century ago, were utterly and entirely out of my\nken. My father was one of the younger members of the family, and\nonly knew these brothers as men.\n\" Uncle Jerry\" recalled episodes such as swimming the creek when\nthey were boys together, and running some risk of getting drowned;\nkilling a cat in Smith's field; the possession of a small rifle, and of a\nlong peculiar skin, like a snake-skin, which he thought was now in\nthe possession of Uncle Robert. (Nos. 44 and 46, especially pp. 503,\n515, 516,517.)\nAll these facts have been more or less completely verified. But the\ninteresting thing is that his twin brother, from whom I got the watch,\nand with whom I was thus in a sort of communication, could not\nremember them all. He recollected something about swimming the\ncreek, though he himself had merely looked on. He had a distinct\nrecollection of having had the snake-skin, and of the box in which it\nwas kept, though he does not know where it is now. But he altogether\ndenied killing the cat, and could not recall Smith's field.\nHis memory, however, is decidedly failing him, and he was good\nenough to write to another brother, Frank, living in Cornwall, an old\nsea captain, and ask if he had any better remembrance of certain facts\n-of course not giving any inexplicable reasons for asking. The result\nof this inquiry was triumphantly to vindicate the existence of\nSmith's field as a place near their home, where they used to play, in\nBarking, Essex; and the killing of a cat by another brother was also\nrecollected; while of the swimming \u00b7of the creek, near a mill-race, full\ndetails were given, Frank and Jerry being the heroes of that fOOlhardy\nepisode. (See notes at end of first series, p. 526.)\nSome of the other facts given I have not yet been able to get\nverified. Perhaps there are as many unverified as verified. And some\nthings appear, so far as I can make out, to be false. One little thing I\ncould verify myself, and it is good, inasmuch as no one is likely to have\nhad any recollection, even if they had any knowledge, of it. Phinuit\ntold me to take the watch out of its case (it was the old-fashioned turnip\nDigitized by Google\n\f460 A Record of Observations of\nvariety) and examine it in a good light afterwards, and I should see\nsome nicks near the handle which Jerry said he had cut into it with his\nknife (p. 518).\nSome faint nicks are there. I had never had the watch out of its\ncase before; being, indeed, careful neither to finger it myself nor to let\nanyone else finger it.\nI neycr let Mrs. Piper in her waking state see the watch till quite\ntowards the end of the time, when I purposely left it lying on my desk\nwhile she came out of the trance. Before long she noticed it, with\nnatural curiosity, evidently becoming conscious of its existence then\nfor the first time.\nI may say here that Dr. Phinuit has a keen \"scent \"-shall I\ncall it 1-for trinkets or personal valuables of all kinds. He recognised\na ring which my wife wears as having been given \" to me for her\" by a.\nspecified aunt just before her death (p. 516), of which he at another\ntime indicated the cause fairly well. He called for a locket which my\nwife sometimes wears, but had not then on, which had belonged to her\nfather 40 yem'S ago. (No. 36.) He recognised my father's watch,\nasked for the chain belonging to it, and was still unsatisfied for want of\nsome appendage which I could not think of at the time, but which my\nwife later on reminded me of, and Phinuit at another sitting seized, as\na seal which had been usually worn with it, and which had belonged\nto my grandfather. (Nos. 50 and 79.)\nHe pulled my sister's watch out of her pocket and said it had been\nher mother's, but disconnected the chain and said that didn't belong,\nwhich was quite right. (No. 83.) Even little pocket things, such as\nfruit-knives and corkscrews, he also assigned to their late owners; and\nonce he quite unexpectedly gripped the ann of the chair Mrs. Piper was\nsitting in, which had never been mentioned to him in any way, and said\nthat it had belonged to my Aunt Anne. It was quite true: it was an\nold-fashioned ordinary type of armchair which she valued and had had\nre-upholstered for us as a wedding present 12 years ago. Phinuit, by the\nway, did not seem to realise that it was a chair: he asked what it was\nand said he took it for part of an organ. (No. 82, p. 548.)\nBut perhaps the best instance of a recognised object was one\nentrusted to me by 0. gentleman abroad, quite a recent friend of mine,\nwith whom I had been staying recently,-a chain which had belonged\nto his father. (The name of this friend I conceal, in case he might not\nwish it published.)\nThe package was delivered by hand one evening at my house, and,\nby good luck, I happened to meet the messenger and receive it direct.\nNext morning I handed it to Dr. Phinuit, saying only, in response to\nhis feeling some difficulty about it, that it did not belong to 0. relative.\nHe said it belonged to an old man and had his son's influence on it. Next\nDigitized by Google\n\fCertain Phenomena of Trance. 461\nsitting I tried the chain again, and he very soon reported the old gentle-\nman as present, and recognising the chain but not recognising me. I\nexplained that his son had entrusted me with it; on which Phinuit said\nthe chain belonged now to \"George Wilson,\" away for health, a preacher,\nand a lot of other details all known to me, and all correct. The old\ngentleman was then represented as willing to write his name. A name\nwas written in the backward manner Phinuit sometimes affects. It\nwas legible afterwaros in a mirror as James Wilson. Now, the name\nof his father I was completely ignorant of (p. 538).\nI explained to the old gentleman, if one may use such a phrase\nmerely for the sake of brevity and as accurately expressing the state of\nbehaviour one has to put oneself into in this investigation in order to\nobtain good result&:-I say I explained to the old gentleman that\nhis son desired to hear from him, and asked him to be good enough to\nprove his identity.\nWhereupon, at intervals, a number of specific though trivial facts\nwere mentioned. They were frequently admitted to be trivial in an\napologetic way, but nevertheless would serve as good evidence; better\nthan more conspicuous ones indeed.\nI took them down as well as I could, knowing absolutely nothing of\nthe correctness or incorrectness of most of them. Such facts as I did\nknow were correct. Hence I had good hopes of another crucial test\nhere.\nEverything which I knew being stated correctly, if all those things\nwhich I did not know should tum out inaccurate or false, I should be\nforcibly impelled towards a direct thought-transference expla.na.tion for\nthis entire set.\nBut, on the other hand, if these things of which I had absolutely\nnever heard or dreamt should tum out true, then some further step\nmust be taken. (Nos. 78-83.)\nIn this state I continued for several months. For though I sent\nout to Africa 8. transcript of the evidence, it was only three weeks ago\nthat I received any reply (p. 530).\nThe reply is important and distinct. It recognises the correctness\nof those things which I knew, and it asserts the total incorrectness of\nthose things of which I was ignorant. So far as this series of facts goes,\ntherefore, the hypothesis of a direct thought-transferential means of\nobtaining information is immensely strengthened. I can indeed\nhardly resist the conclusion that the series of facts purporting to be\nrelated by the elder Mr. Wilson have no more substantiality than II.\ndream of my own; that I was, so to speak, dreaming by proxy, and\nimposing upon myself, through the mouth of the medium, a number of\nstatements such as it is not difficult to imagine reported to one in a\ndream. I trust I am making it clear that I was not the least in\n2 K\nDigitized by Google\n\f462 A Reco'rd of ObservatiO'1l8 of\na. dreamy or somnolent condition; but whereas in a. dream some\nautomatic part of the brain imposes on one's consciousness a collection\nof imaginary facts, so this same automatic part of my brain may ha'\\\"e\nbeen imposing on Dr. Phinuit, and leading him to tell me, in what was\napparently good faith, a series of imaginary episodes: deluding us\nboth into supposing it possible that they had a basis of truth.l\nThe result of the experiment is thus definite, though it would be\na rather rapid induction to dra,v a general conclusion from it. It is to\nbe remembered that I did obtain, in the case of my uncle, a statement\nof things quite unknown to me.\nThe difference, of course, is that these were relatives; and though\nsome of the events happened almost before my father was born, yet he\nmight ha\"e heard some gossip about them in his boyhood. It is far\nmore unlikely that I myself had ever heard anything about them,\nbecause of lapse of time and other circumstances, but the possibility of\neven this can hardly be excluded in the case of e\\'ents which haye\noccurred in a family, even in the elder generation of it.\nI can only say that I have not the slightest recollection of ever\nhaving heard them. Somebody living knew them, of course, or else they\ncould not have been verified; but they were not known to anyone\npresent. (See further remarks, p. 527 ; also Index, p. 649,)\nSomething of the same sort was suggested by an experiment my\nfriend Mr. Gonner had arranged at an early sitting. (No. 39.) He had\ncombined with his sister in London to watch their mother at a certain\nhour on a certain day, not telling her anything about it, but at the\nsame time trying to coax her into doing something extraordinary, for\nreasons to be afterwards explained. We found afterwards that the\nselection of an unusual proceeding consisted in dri\"ing round Regent's\nPark in a hansom cab in the wet. And this is what she was doing\nduring the time her son was sitting at Liverpool, with Dr. Phinuit, hold-\ning a little book of hers to Mrs. Piper's head. He had carefully not\narranged or suggested anything as a suitable proceeding, but he had a\npresentiment that some not very striking occurrence would prooobly be\ndeemed sufficient. It is impossible to say that the idea of a possible\noutdoor excursion may not have been latent in his mind.\nWe were completely ignorant of what was going on in London, but\nDr. Phinuit described the surroundings of the old lady and the two\ngirls who were with her-described her as being over-persuaded to go\nout, though she didn't want to, and as going clearly through the\noperation of outdoor dressing: several minute actions, such as opening\n1 It JIlIIoy be just worth mentioning that although \"James\" \\\\'1\\8 not the name of\nMr. Wilson's father (whOl!e name WI\\8 Goorge, the Rame as his own), yet it waa the\nname of his grandfather; and that some of the 8tatements of events would haye a\ntruer ring if they hall purported to come from the grandfather.\nDigitized by Google\n\f\u00b7 Cel-tain Pherwmena of Tmnce. 463\na box, taking up a photograph from dressing-table to look at, and so\non, being mentioned correctly. But there he stopped. We did not\nget to Regent's Park and the cab, though that 'fas the stage reached\nwhile he was speaking, but he stopped short at the stage reached just\nabout when the sitting began; though he said he was describing the\npresent moment (p. 488). More experiments of this nature are wanted,\nand very likely have been made by others. I do not pretend that this\nexperiment by itself is quite satisfactory, but it is striking as far as it\ngoes, and the thought-transference aspect of it is this :-\nThe evcnts could not have been obtained from our minds, for we\nknew nothing of them. . The book established, we will suppose, rapport\nwith the old lady, but this rapport must have been very one-sided, for\nshe knew nothing whatever about our proceedings; nor did her com-\npanion, the young lady who accompanied her. [See notes at end of\nfirst series, p. 529.] If experiments like this ca.n be got to succeed\ndefinitely, we seem driven to suppose that the mind of a neutral uncon-\nscious person can be read at any distance, even though engaged in\nother things and thinking other thoughts, connection being established\nby some link, such as a bit of jewellery, an old letter, or a lock of\nha.ir, and sometimes no connection being established at all.\nThere is no doubt a step further, or, as it is often thought, nn\nalternative step, which some enthusiastic persons a.re indignant with us\nfor not being able to take at once. I don't know whether to call it a step\nfurther or an alternative step. The step is to suppose that thought-\ntransference can go on from the very persons who are ostensibly speaking\nand sending messages. This hypothesis is one that obtrudes itself\ncbnstantly ; and the reports are necessarily saturated with its language\nand atmosphere. It is difficult not to be occasionally impelled towards\nit, so vividly is it presented, and yet I hardly know whether it is\npossible seriously to contemplate it as an explanation.\nTo the obvious and superficial aspect, the settin!! of the communica-\ntions, the Spiritualistic hypothesis lends itself naturally; and, since it\nseems the natural mode for the trance-personality to express itself, it is\nimpossible to conduct a satisfactory series of sittings, or to give a faith-\nful report of them, without employing its terminology; but whether it\nreally assists towards an explanation of the phenomena\" or whether it\nis even capable of scientific statement and examination, I do not feel\ncompetent to express an opinion.\nIt is a puzzling matter to incorporate into science the reeently-\nestablished fact of an extraordinary or apparently direct action between\nmind and mind, both possessing brains; and a. kind of disembodied\naction seems likely to be still more puzzling.\nEven if such a hypothesis could be intelligently granted I do not\nsee that it would explain all the facts. Not those last related, f()r\n2 K 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f46-l! A &corel of Observcttio'nlJ of\ninstance; nor Phinuit's skill in recognising diseases and contemporary\nevents. Thought-transference does better for some of these; but I\nhardly think it serves for all. This is a very important point, and if\nI discuss it further I should prefer to do so after examining the entire\nrecord of facts and contemplating them as a whole.\nIf we reject ordinary thought-transference as inadequate, it seems\nas if we should be driven to postulate direct clain\"oyance ; to suppose\nthat in a trance a person is able to enter a region where miscellaneous\ninformation of all kinds is readily ayailable; where, for instance, tim&\nand space are not; so that everything that has happened, whether at\na distance or close at hand, whether long ago or recently, can be seen\nor heard and de.scriherl. Letters in a box, for instance (which, though\nnot read in my case, are said to be sometimes read), might be read on\nthis hypothesis by harking back to the time before they were put in ;\nor, if we assume it possible to see the future also, by looking forward\nto the time when they were taken out. A fourth dimension of space is\nknmvn to get O\\\"er difficulties like this, and an omnipresent time is very\nlike a fourth dimension\"\nThen, again, old fncts, such as the boyish acts related of my uncle~\nmust be supposed llarrated not by him nor by his agency at all, but by\nMrs. Piper, a direct onlooker at the past in her state of trance.\nI see no way of getting round such an elastic hypothesis as this. It;\ncould explain anything and everything; but is it not rather like postu-\nlating omniscience, anrl considering that an explanation 1 It is all very\nwell to call a thing clairvoyance, but the thing so called stands just as\nmuch in need of explanation as before.\nUndoubtedly Mrs. Piper in the ~rance state has access to some\nabnonnal sources of information, and is for the time cognisant of facta\nwhich happened long ago or at a distance; but the question is how she\nbecomes cognisant of them. Is it by going up the stream of time and\nwitnessing those actions as they occurred; or is it through information\nreceived from the still existent actors, themselves dimly remembering\nanrl relating them; or, again, is it through the influence of contemporary\nand otherwise occupied minds holding stores of forgotten information in\ntheir brains and offering them unconsciously to the perception of the\nentranced person; or, lastly, is it by falling back for the time into a.\nono Universal Mind of which all ordinary consciousnessea past and\npresent are but portions 1 I do not know which is the least ex-\ntTllvagant supposition.\nPossibly some hypothesis more simple than any of these may be,\nor by German psychologists has been, invented, but at present I feel as\nif it were unlikely that anyone explanation will fit all the facts. It\nrather feels as if we were at the beginning of what is practically a.\n.fresh branch of science; and that to pretend to frame explanatio~\nDigitized by Google\n\fCerta.in, Phe'YIomena of T-rmlCe. 465\nexcept in the most tentative and elastic fashion for the purpose of\nthreading the facts together and suggesting fresh fields for experiment,\nis as premature as it would have been for Galvani to have expounded\nthe nature of Electricity, or Copernicus the laws of Comets and\nMeteors. ~_\nDETAILED REPORT OF SITTINGS.\nHere follows a mention of every sitting I had with lIrs. Piper,\nnumbered so as to fit in chronological order with the sittings superin-\ntended by other persons. Sometimes the report is fairly lull-some-\ntimes much abbreviated. It would be tedious to quote everything, and\nI use what judgment I can to give a fair estimate of the proceedings.\nWhen it happens that the notes taken permit of a very full report,\nsuch a report is once or twice given; but it will, I hope, be realised\nthat this is done to increase the vividness of the report, not by any\nmeans with the idea that every word said is important. In one sense,\nindeed, it may be impossible for anyone to tell at this stage of the\ninquiry what is really important and what is not. All one can do is to\npreserve the original records for the purpose of testing such theories as\nmay be forthcoming in the future.\nWhen the failures or successes offer anything obviously instl\"Uctive,\nor when they are unintelligible to strangers without explanation, I\nappend a note to them; at other times I pass them by with merely\nsufficient indication to show whether they are fairly correct or fairly\nincorrect.\nAs already explained, it is convenient to call l\\ll-s. Piper in the\ntrance-state \"Dr. Phinuit,\" because that is what she then calls herself.\nA little confusion between masculine and feminine pronouns may be\nthus introduced, but, on the whole, it assists the exp~ion of facti;.\nThe first sitting in which I took part was at Mr. llyers' house in\nCambridge under circumstances related above (p. 444).

He remembers\nthat; it was the last thing he took.\nNOTE.--The death of her father was as follows (related by her mother):\nHis health had been broken by tropical travel and yellow fever, and\nhis heart was weak, (for instance, his life could not be insured).\nShortly after marriage he went on what was intended to be a last\nvoyage, and returned only three months before his wife was confined.\nThirteen days after the confinement, which had been very severe,\nand the strain of which had made him faint, he entered his wife's\nroom half dressed and holding a handkerchief to his mouth, which\nwas full of blood. He stretched out his hand to her, removed the\nhandkerchief, and tried to speak, but only gasped and fell on the\nfloor. Very soon he was dead.\nRegarding the \"liquid,\" I am unable to find any existing recollection,\nbut he was being attended by a doctor and was taking medicine at\nthe time.\nAs to the next episode, he had broken his leg by falling down the hold\nof his ship once, and in certain states of the weather it used to pain\nhim. It was the right leg, and although my wife's impression was\nthat the locality speci6.ed was incorrect-that it really was above\nthe knee-on inquiry from her mother we find that the place\nindicated below is perfectly right. [See also p. 493.]\nHe feels a pain in his right leg too, something had happened to it\n(rubbing leg), something from a fall here (below the knee). It gave him\npain at times--had to prop it up. [See just above.]\nThis locket helps him to remember; you didn't have it at first, the other\nMary had it. (Gasping.) \"Alex, love to Mary, his wife.\" He makes me feel\nweak.\nHow that shakes up old memories and brings her near him again. Wait a\nlittle (still grasping locket), he will be able to remember exact place where\nhe got this. (pause.)\nThere's a little one's hair connected with it ; he's not clear about the\nhair. I don't want to seem inquisitive, but has it been put in since you\nhad it 1\n\" No, I think not.\"\nWell, he's mixed on the hair, it's too confused to see.

[See note.]\nHullo, he's got funny butto1l8, big, brigbt. He wears these butto1l8 and\nthings on his shoulders, a sort of unifornl dress. He's gone back and\nohanged his dress since he was here before. A uniform. He has been a\ncommander, au officer, a leader; not military, but a commander; it was\nthrough this that he got this locket and hair.\nHe used to go about a good deal, travel, he got this (locket) one of his\njourneys. This was got from the North. He went to Scotland at one time.\nNOTE.-The locket is one he got on one of his voyages, but no one\nknows where, neitber does it matter. It is correct to say that it is\na locket containing hair, but it does not contain hair in the ordinary\nsense ; it contai1l8 a little picture-a landscape-beautifully worked\nin (presumably human) hair, hut nobody's ill particular. It looks\nmore like sepia than hair. The\" trouble with teeth,\" which to me\nsounded vague, turns out on inquiry to be definite, for their short\nmarried life was a good deal disturbed by toothache ; he used to\ngo to the dentist with her and be much grieved by her pain. There\nwere several episodes about teeth, and once there was an adminis-\ntration of chlorofornl which proved nearly fatal, so that she has\nnever had chloroform for anything since. (My wife's mother lives\nin Staffordshire, and was in Staffordshire all the time of the sittings ;\nknowing nothing about them at the time. My wife, however,\nremembers having heard the toothache spoken of.) The episod~\nabout changing his clothes is sufficient.ly ludicrous; but he did have\n\" coat with brass buttons, and it led to the practically correct\nperception of his. profession (captain in merchant service), and n.\nlittle further on Phinuit suddenly brings out the word Cap'n in\nconnection with him, but, in a curious and half puzzled way, applies\nit to me. It remained my Phinuit nickname to the end, though\nquite inapplicable.\nYour mother has got a good picture of him taken a long time ago, pretty\ngood, old-fashioned, but not so bad of him. Yes, pretty good. He looks\nlike that now. He looks younger than he did. That's particularly so.\nLIt is an amateur painting done by someone on board his vessel.\nAtrocious as a PIcture, but likeness caught. It is kept in a pillow-\ncase in a locked cuphoanl.

But there's another lady there, too, who would like to speak with\nyou, but she cannot. She's in spirit-passed ont, from some difficulty with\nher heart. It's your mother. It was bad condition of heart and stomach.\nShe has light hair-blue eyes-straight. Very clear complexion and pretty\nmouth. Very pleasant looking lady. I can't get to talk with her. (Pause.)\nIt's a friend of your father who had the small-pox, and he passed out. He\nwas thrown overboard. His name was Arthur. [To this I can get no\nclue.] Oh! Lord! there's a pain in the ankle-it was stepping out of the\nearriage.

There was a place on the neck.\nThis brother died after prolonged epilepsy, conjecturally originating\nwith scarlet fever.

R.], Agnes' gentleman, that one\u00b7\nthat was here, you k~ow.\n\" Yel!, all right. I'll send message.\"\nNOTEl! BY G. H. R.\nRegarding the two seances, I was quite convinced of the genuineness of\nthe phenomena. There appeared to me no opening for preconcerted fraud,\nand an impostor could gain little or nothing either by feigning trance state\nor adopting such an unnatural impersonation as an Americanised Frenchman.\nwith familiarly slangy manner.\nThe knowledge communicated by medium appeared to me to extend\nbeyond the possibility of chance coincidence. The names of all my four\nbrothers were giyen correctly, and also death of my mother, eldest brother,\nand (vaguely) death of infant sister.\nAny previous getting up of the case seems to me impossible. I never\nthought of the locket till preceding night, and have not worn it for yea1\"l'.\nThe lady was a relative by marriage, who died nearly 20 years back, and\nwhose existence or family was to the best of my belief unknown to anyone\nin Liverpool.\nCompured with the correct statements, the inaccuracies were slight; few\nnames were given wrong (two or three only), but several names or .. spirits \"\nwere introduced to whom I had no clue. There certainly seemed confusion\nof personalities and relationships, both of the spirits and of those present, as\nthough the communicant (doctor) had muddled up people. One curious\nfreak of confusion was the association (recurring morning and evening) of\nmy sprained ankle with the personality of my maternal aunt, who, on\nwriting, I found had had no sprain or accident.\nSome of the easiest questions (on any fraud supposition) were 1l1lanSwered.\ne.g., \"Did A. know whether I was married 1\" And there were obvious\ninaccuracieA, Auch as \"I met you a week ago,\" relating to IlloMling\ninterview.\nAs for thought-transference, I could not trace conscious action of my\nown mind on the medium. Things were said constantly that I did not\n\fCerta'in Phenomena of Tl'Clnce. 481\nexpect, and that were not in my mind; other things strongly present to\nmy mind were (1) quite outside medium's knowledge, or (2) confusedly\ngUeB8ed at, or (3) referred to in quite unexpected terms or connectionB-\ne.g., my brother W88 correctly called George; but he would never have come\ninto my head by that name, by which (though hiB first name in order) he has\nnever been known or called. At the same time, statements lying outside\nmy own knowledge, in the most crucial C8868, furnishing the most direct\ncriteria (e.y., proper names unknown to me), proved incorrect upon\nverification.\nI have no theory. The account of phenomena given by the entranced\nmedium, viz., confU8ed communicationB with other intelligences of persona\ndead or living (but particularly dead), is not out of accord with the facts ;\nbut nothing occurred to convince me that this was the only admi88ible\nexplanation.\nG. H. RENDALL.\nIn the next sitting, when !Ir. Gonner only was present with me,\nthere is a great deal that is incoherent and confused. Some ofit appears\nexplicable by supposing that the family of Mr. Gonner's mother are\nbeing mentioned, instead of his own. But this is obviously a too elastic\nhypothesis to be worth strictly examining or annotating on. The notes\nmight be abbreyia,ted with advantage were it not that there are a few\nimportant incidents which it is probably better to give in their full\nsetting.\nSitti-ng No. 39.

No. 39.\nWith reference to this interview there are several points deserving\nattention. Some of these are of sufficient importance to be trested of\nseparately, but a few remarks of a more general character may precede any\nsuch attempts at detail.\nThat Mrs. Piper WI\\S acquainted with my history and circumstances is\nhighly improbable; not only was she unaware before she came to Liver-\npool that I should sit to her, but I waS introduced to her under the name of a\ncolleague and not in my own. Any theory as to previous investigation\nfalls necessarily to the ground, for eyen had she been able to discover the\nantecedents of Professor Lodge's colleagues, she would in consequence of\nthis safeguard have been led to attribute my relations and circumstances to\nanother, his to me. As will, however, be seen, in the course of the inter-\nview she uttered my name \"Gonner\" (p. 489).\nThough in many instances she gave curious details of events or persons,\nthese were produced with great difficulty and generally surrounded with much\nthat was inaccurate and confused. At times, too, she was uncertain, and\nseemed hardly able to attain to accuracy in her information. She was uncer-\ntain as to the number of my brothers and sisters (p. 488), wrong both in her\nremark to me (p. 489), and afterwards to Professor Lodge (p. 490) as to my\nfather's Christian name. In consequence her power, genuine though it may\nappear to be, seems imperfect, and in consequence her information is\ninaccurate.\nThis, however, must, I think, have a very considerable bearing on the plain\ntheory of thought-transference. Let us grant that I was aware of the death\nand attendant circumstances of the death of my \"uncle William,\" yet at the\ntime I was unconscious of them; unaware, indeed, at the moment as to whom\nshe \\vas referring when she mentioned William for the first time (p. 488).\nBut when she was speaking of my father and searching after his name, I was\nkeenly conscious that it was Peter and not John. Again when (p. 489) she\nstated that my father was present but did not know me-that I had been\nchanged by an illness and consequently hardly recognisable by my spirit\nfriends-I thought distinctly enough that my illness was some eight years\nback, my father's death but two and a-half.\nDid she then give any accurate information which could not be accounted\nfor by thought-transference 1 She told me (p. 488) that within a day or two\nmy mother heard of the death of a friend. If she referred to the days pre-\nceding the interview she was wrong, if following, right, since a very old\nfriend of my mother's died that very (Saturday) morning. But this question\n.concerns a point which will be touched on in one of the notes.\nNOTE A.-In preparation for the interview I had written and asked my\nDigitized by Google\n\f492 .A Record of Observat\u00b7i0n8 of\nsister (Ellen Elizabeth Gonner) to persuade my mother to do something that;\nwas unusual for her between the hours of 11 and 12 Saturday moming; and\nto observe what she did. My mother was not to know, and did not know,\nthat she was doing this at my request. Saturday moming, at a few minutes\nbefore 11, she prepared herself for going out to take\" drive in a hansom cab,\nthis striking her as an unusual procedure, as it was raining. Such preparation\ninvolved touching the head in tho putting on of her bonnet, of her neck and\nshoulders when she put on her cloak (p. 488). Then she was specially observed\nto take her muft' box from her wardrobe, to place it on a table, lift the lid,\nand take her muft' out (p. 488). On her dressing-table there stands a small\nphotograph of my father, which she very frequently takes up and looks at;\nintently (p. 490). Whether she did this on the occasion in question cannot;\nbe ascertained, as it is one of those ordinary actions the performance of which\nmakes no impression. She cannot, however, be said to have been suft'ering\nfrom her head. There is a wooden half-tester in her room, which might;\nconceiVRbly be called a \"cot.\" [See also notes at end of this series, p. 529.]\nThere is here a general correspondence between her actions at three or\nfour minutes to 11, and those attributed to her by the medium at 11.25-\n11.30. But the seance was beginning at 11, and the medium began at once\nwith my mother. It is then an interesting matter to examine whether she\nwas trying to discover what my mother was engaged upon at the moment or\nto recall her actions as she last perceived them.\nNOTE B.-The instant reference to William (p. 488) in connection with my\nmother seems to indicate a connection between the medium and my mother,\nrather than a connection between the medium and myself. My uncle,\nWilliam Carter, was killed in an election riot in Yorkshire, near Wakefield,\n1837, by a stone which struck him on the head (p.490). The news of his\ndeath was a terrible shock to my mother, who was then at school in\nGermany.\nI think that the reference \"\" long time\" means that he was ill and died\na long time. back; so at least did I understand it at the sitting.\nNOTE C.-No brother of my mother's died in Australia (p. 488).\nAbout the name of the place the medium seemed uncertain (p. 488). One of\nmy uncles died in India of cholera. His name, however, was not Henry\nthough his initials were J. H. (John Halliley Carter) (p. 489). I did not know\nthe existence of his second name.\nNOTB D.-My mother's name is Elizabeth (pp. 489-90). She was inVRri-\nably called Lizzie by my father. My sister's name is Ellen Ellizabetb\nGonner (p. 489).\nNOTE E.-\" Annie\" (p. 487) is the name of the young lady to whom I am\nengaged. Beyond the one fact of her name, the description was too vague\nto afford much proof' of knowledge of any kind, though correct &8 far as it\ngoes. \"Is her hair short or long 1\" (p. 489). This question I asked, having\nbeen informed by letter that she had had her hair cut quite short. The\nanswer of the medium clearly conveyed the impre88ion that such was not the\ncase; and I concluded that it was an instance of error. On reaching London\nI found to my surprise that it was correct,-th\"t her hair had not been cut.\nshort after all.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOertain Phenomena of Trance. 493\nNOTE F.-These imdmlces, I think, show that Mrs. Piper's infonuation,\nthough genuine and remarkable, W88 not invariably accurate, a conclusion\ngreatly fortified when the remainder of the sitting is taken into account.\nThey indicate, perhaps, one other point of interest. Mrs. Piper seems to\nhave been in communication with my mother's mind, to all seeming as\ncomplete 88 that which she maintained with mine. Sometinles she appeared,\nindeed, nearer to my mother. In consequence, at these times there was\nsome confusion between her brothers and my own (p. 488). She had several\nbrothers who died in infancy. I had none.\nWritten by way of comment on and in explanation of record of interview\nof December 21st, 1889,88 taken by Professor Lodge.\nJanuary 13th, 1890. E. C. K. GONNER.\nSitting No. 40. Saturday evening, 7 p.m., December 2lat, 1889.\nPresent: O. J. L. alone, taking notes himself.\n(I sat to Mrs. Piper with my hands crossed, so that after the trance came\non it W88 my right hand that W88 released and left hand kept; I was thus\nable to take rough notes.)\nThat man's father's name was Thomas; both Thomas . . \u2022 (and\n80 on, 88 reported and annotated 88 appendix to previous sitting, p. 490).\nMary's father used to be on board ship, and he fell and hurt his leg.\nFell through a hole in the boat. [Correct.] Can't remember where he got\nthat article. It was on one of his voyages; but Mary may remember.\n[Does not.] Her second father is William ; that is the one with the white\nhead. The first one W88 Alexander Marshall. [All correct. This is the\nfirst appearance of the surname; it came quite pat. See also p. 472.]\nThere is one named Clara. You have a sister named Florence.\n\" No.\"\nWell, Florence belongs to you ; it is your Florence. She has the friend\nWhiteman. (See Sitting No. 38, p. 485.) But there are two Florences.\nThere's a Florence in some other country. One paints and the other doesn't\npaint. One's married and the other isn't married. It is the one who\ndoesn't paint who is married.\n[This is an insignificant communication, but see Note A below,and p.500.]\nHere followed a prediction, and soon afterwards the personality seemed\nto change to that of a deceased male friend, whom I will call Mr. E.,\nof whom I had handed in a letter. The speaker now called me\n\"Lodge,\" in his natural manner (a name which Phinuit himself\nnever once used), and we had & long conversation, mainly non-\nevidential, but with a reference to some private matters which were\nsaid to be referred to 88 proof of identity, and which are well\nadapted to the purpose. They were absolutely unknown to me, but\nhave been verified through a common friend. Among other things\nwe discU88ed Phinuit (see also pp.517 and 553), and I said that I\nwanted to try him with some unknown cardboard letters in a sealed\nbox, but doubted if it were of much use. The voice said :\nBy all means try. All these experiments mus~ be tried.\n\"Well, tell him it's very important.\"\nYes. Here he is coming back.\nNow thon, what is it you want of me 1\n2 )I\nDigitized by Google\n\f494 A Record of Obse1'Vatiom of\n\"I want you, doctor, to tell me what's in this box, please. No on8\nknows.\"\nGive me a pencil (putting the box to top of medium's head).\nA pencil was handed to him and he wrote on cardboard, slowly,\nL K Que N\nand then dropped the pencil. [See Note B, and also p. 495.]\nI gave him another pill box in which were letters I did know.\n\"Thank you. Can you do these too 1\"\nI'll try. No, I can't, I am dazed with that other box, and besides I am\ngetting too weak. Try me earlier on another time. I am going now.\nNOTE A.-I happen to have two cousins Florence, one married and\nabroad, and who, so far as I know, does not paint. I wrote to my other cousin\nFlorence (who paints and is not married), asking if she had a friend MiSli or\nMrs. Whiteman, or'Vhyteman, whom she had seen lately and had something\nthe matter with her head, a headache or something. She sent a postcard to\nsay \"No, what on earth do you mean 1\" Next day another postcard to say:-\n\" Whytehead won't do, will it 1 I am this very day returning such a one'li\ncall, and drinking tea it has struck me on re-reading your letter as being\nsomething like the name you inquire about. She is lately married.\"\n(It is perhaps more than a little far-fetched to suggest that Dr. Phinuit\nmay have caught the name wrongly, and on being corrected by the syllable\n\"head\" have proceeded to say that she had something wrong with her head:)\nNOTE B.-This was a very carefully planned experiment. Some children's\ncard letters pinched by me out of a box containing a good many alphabets at\nthe house of ProfeSlior Carey Foster were put into a pill box without looking\nat them, and sealed up very carefully in his presence, using his seal, &c. All\nthis was done on November 29th, preparatory to my Cambridge visit.\nAfter Dr. Phinuit had ostensibly read the letters I wrote two accounts,\nwith full details of the letters and their apparent position in the box. One I\nsent to Mr. Myers, the other under seal to Professor Carey Foster, asking him\nto wire if he were at home and could open the box. He did wire, and I Beut him\nthe box. He opened it carefully and wrote out every detail, before having\nread my sealed statement. The letters actually in box were: W-A-R-K\n-D-N-E-D.\nThere is thus no connection whatever (beyond chance) between the two\nstatements, and the experiment completely failed.\nThe next sitting was a very poor one, with a lot of rambling talk.\nIn it occurred a little squabble between Dr. Phinuit and myself,\nbecause I remonstrated with him for fishing and talking va\",auely\ninstead of holding his tongue. He said it was all dark, no good to-\nday; that the medium couldn't be feeling well, and so on. The only\nincidents worth recording are here stated.\nSittillf\/ No. 41.

He doesn't remember much about you.\n\"I don't know which one you mean.\"\nToo bad. He's connected with Uncle Robert.\nI handed in the box of letters again, and he wrote them down I\\B before,\nbut not so distinctly-L-K-Q-N-U-C.\nSoon after occurred the episode of \"Charlie Randall,\" I\\B reported at\nend of Sitting 38. .\nHe said something jocular about my wife's stepfather being her uncle,\nevidently referring to the lllistake he had made in at first calling\nhim Uncle William. (See Sitting No. 16, p. 468.)\nAsked to tell us about himself if he couldn't say anything about other\npeople, he said his wife had been Mary Latimer, and that she (or\nhe?) had a sister Josephine. Born in Marseilles. (See also p. 520.)\n(That WI\\B all of the slightest moment. Such things I\\B telling Alfred\nthat\" there are two Charleys and two Henrys in your family,\"\nthough it happens to be true, are obviously not worth the quoting.)\nAfter this occurred two sittings, Nos. 42 and 43,at which a medical\nman practising in Liverpool was introduced, without notice, by the\nnallle of Dr. Jones. He came again the same evening and brought\nhis wife. This time, unfortunately, they were admitted by a servant,\nwho announced their names. Phinuit did not mention it, however.\nThe full account of these sittings is long, and would require a great\ndeal of annotation to make the details clear. For the sake of\nhrevity, I propose merely to abstract them. There are a number of\nerroneous statements, some of them to be partially accounted for by\nthe fact that Dr. and Mrs. C. are cousins (a fact Phinuit did not\nascertain), and that he mixed their relatives at the second sitting.\nThe family seems to be a very lal'ge one. I quote later the misstate-\nments, but first I pick out the correct ones or those which require\ncomment. I may say that Dr. C. was almost entirely silent. Occasion-\nally he assented with a grunt, but I found afterwards that he was\nassenting to wrong quite as much as to right statements. I hardly'\never knew what was right and what wrong as I took the notes. He\nwas thus an excellent though trying sitter. Phinuit was in one of\nhis most loquacious moods, or he would not have progressed so well.\nTowards the end one could see he began to get tired of his own\nmonologue.

At the first\nDigitized by Google\n\fOei'tain Phenomena of Trance. 497\nsitting sho is supposed erroneously to be lame, but at the second sitting this\nis corrected and explained, and all said about her is practically correct,\nincluding the cold she then had. Mrs. Piper had had no opportunity what-\n-ever of knowing or hearing of the C. children by ordinary social means. Wo\nbarely know them ourselves. Phinuit grasped the child's name gradually,\n'using it at first as a mere description. I did not know it myself. Dr.\nPhinuit is lavish with predictions, such as the one at the end, which fre-\nquently, I think ususlly, fail. I deeply regret to say that his predictions\n-regarding Daisy are likewise false, for she caught the in1luenza, and the\nannouncement of her death is in to-day's paper.-June, 1890.\nThe following is a summary of the false assertions :-\nERRONEOUS STATEMENTS.\nAt Sitting 42 :-\n\"Your lady's Fanny ; well, there is a Fanny. [No.] Fred has light\nhair, brownish moustache, prominent noso. [No.] Your thesis was BOme\nspecial thing. I should say about lungs.\" [No.]\nAt Sitting 43 :-\n\"Your mother's name was Elizabeth.

Your brother the captain\n{correct], with a lovely wife, who has brown hair [correct], has had trouhle\nin head [no], and has two girls and a boy.\" [No, three girls.]\nDr. C. permits me to append the following note of his on the case,\nwritten some time later:-\n\"The trance state seemed natural; but had more voluntary movement\nthan I had ever seen in an epileptic attack. The entire change in Mrs.\nPiper's manner and behaviour is unlike an intentional effort, and it is\npossible she herself believes that the conditiolls mean something outside of\nherself. With regard to the result, the misses seem to balance the hits, and\nthe 'reading' is not\u00b7 so impressive as the ' sitting.' After reading over\nyour notes I think they consist of a certain amount of thought-reading\nand a large amount of skilful guessing.\"\nAt the next sitting I had arranged for a shorthand writer to be\npresent, and take everything down as nearly verbatim as possible.\nIt is not a very favourable sitting, and the only special importance\nattaching to it is owing to the fact that it was by parcel post that morn-\ning that the watch arrived which was mentioned in the introduction\n(p. 458); but as this was one of the few sittings for which the report was\nattempted to he made verbatim I think that space must be spared for\nits insertion in full ; it being understood, I hope, that the full report is\nDigitized by Google\n\f498 . A Record of ObseI'Vat ions of\ngiven in order to convey a better notion of the whole manner of a sitting\nother than a first one, i.e., one conducted by a stranger. It will be\nperceived that by this time we converse pretty freely with the Phinuit\npersonality, in order to draw him out. In the early sittings I had\nbeen reticent, and I had introduced reticent strangers, until I had\ncompletely satisfied myself of the existence of some kind of power, and\nof the honesty of Mrs. Piper; I was now anxious to push the experi-\nment further, so as to distinguish if possible between mind-reading and\nclairvoyance proper: I wanted to get something which I did not\nknow. It was with this object that I had written for the watch; and\nit was with this in view that I sometimes now saved time by convey-\ning some common bit of information myself. Such a proceeding may\nhave been less judicious than I deemed it, but whatever I already kne\\\\'\nit was but of little advantage to be told; I had already ascertained\nthat Phinuit could do that; I wanted to be told something that I could\nafterwards verify, and it seemed to me that Phinuit got on better\nwhen one gave his powers some SOl\u00b7t of confidence, and did not continue\nto ask trivial testing questions such as \" How many brothers have I\ngot 1\" Such questions are proper enough for strangers to ask; but\nafter a time Phinuit gets impatient with an old sitter unless he goes\non to more reasonable matter. In our ignorance of the mode of mind-\naction involved it may be rash to surmise, but I think it probable\nthat a sitter really and not only scientifically anxious to gain infor-\nmation on some subject would be likely to get the best results; and I\nendeavoured to put myself as nearly as possible into the appl\"Opriate\nattitude for receiving information. I perceive that it has a ludicl\u00b7ous\neffect in print.\nI wish, moreover, to point out that the view to be taken of this and\nsome later sittings depends entirely on the view one takes of Mrs.\nPiper's personal honesty. It is by strangers that this must be and has\nbeen tested. Since she knew she was to stay with me it cannot be\ndenied that a fraudulent and industrious person could manage to\nsecure information concerning my relatives (p. 52i). Once more I repeat\n(for what it is worth) that I am convinced that that is not the way it\nwas done; but the real evidence on such 1\\ point must rest on the int{'r-\nviews with suddenly introduced strangers.\nIn the annexed report nothing is purposely omitted. The occasional\ndots only mean that the speech was too rapid or too inaudible for the\nstenographer. The latter in writing out his notes has prefixed to all\nPhinuit's speeches the symbol \"Dr.,\" and I have left it so. But for\ngreater clearness, and in order to indicate the changes of voice and\nmanner, which were sometimes only partial but were occasionally\nmarked, I have altered this prefix in a few places to the initial of the\npersonality supposed to be speaking, putting a query-ml1.l'k at the\n\fOe1\u00b7tain Phenomena of Trance. 499\ndoubtful places where I do not know whether Phinuit intended us to\nsuppose that he was reporting in the first person, or that he had\ntemporarily quitted his post. Nothing at all depends on these prefixes,\nthey merely assist an understanding of how the dialogue sounded j\nand it was only very occasionally that the changed voice and mauner\nresembled that of the person supposed to be speaking sufficiently to\nexcite interest. It will, of course, be perceived that, in even a\nsuccessful imitation of voice and manner, there need only be a trifle of\nexecutive skill in addition to mind-reading.\nSitting No. 44. Noon.

Doctor:\"\nNOTBB.\nA. The facts concerning what is often referred to not at all clearly all\nthe joint busineBB life of my two uncles are, I am told, 88 follows. Uncle J tlrry,\nwhen young, was mathematical master at Lucton School, in Herefordshire.\nThen he became actuary to the Palladium Life Ill8urance Company. When\nthat ceased to exist, he became secretary to a salvage &88OCiation in the\nCity, and head clerk at Lloyd's. Uncle Robert was all along secretary of the\nMarine 11l8urance Company. The buaineBBes were thus not very distinct, but\nthey never technically\" worked together,\" though after Uncle Jerry became\nblind he used to go every day into the City and sit through buaineBB hours in\nUncle Robert's office, where, as a boy, I have often seen him.\nB. The facta concerning the photographs are these. There are two framed\nphotographs of Uncle Jerry, and both these I remember having often seen. A\nprint of one of them is in the house, and hence Mrs. Piper may poBBibly havtl\nseen it; but it is an ugly thing, relegated to some attic. I suppose it belongs\nto the early days of amateur photography. It consists of a gate in the middle\nof some iron railings, and standing by each gatepost is a man in a tall hat.\nOne of these men is Uncle Jerry, the other is not Uncle Robert, but a friend\nof both, the late Major Cheere; I thought at the time that it was the much\nmore intimate friend of both, Mr. Robert Cheere.\nThe other photograph referred to is a better one. I have since had it\nsent me from London. In it Uncle Jerry is sitting down blind on a garden\nseat, probably at Mr. Cheere's, and near him is sitting a son of one of the\ngardeners, to whom he is giving a le880n in algebra.\nThe mention made by Phinuit is ambiguous as to whether it refers to two\npictures with figures in different attitudes in each, or whether it means one\npicture with two figures in different attitudes.

The welfare of my only sister, Eleanor, commonly called Nellie, much\nyounger than the brothers, and left in their charge, is naturally a care to us,\nand the advice given and subsequently iterated again and again by Phinuit,\n88 the one mCBBage which my mother was anxious to send, is extremely\nnatural. Mrs. Piper had not seen, nor so far as I know heard of, my sister,\nwho was in Staffordshire during this first series; but at the second series of\ntlittings she was present on a short visit. The state of her health has for\nsome time made her place of abode and study a serious cOll8ideration, and\nthe neceaaary indecision has been naturally disquieting to herself, as stated.\nSee also many subsequent sittings, e.g., No. 46 of this series (pp. 513, 514,\n.and 532).\nThe next sitting was the first with our neighbours the Thompsolls\n-(p. 4(5). lirs.

T. some way off.\n.,Hulloa, Captain, I've been talking to your friends. Had a long talk with\nUncle Jerry. He remembers you now, as a boy with Aunt Anne [thill is\"\nexactly how he would remember me], but you were kind of small. He knew\nyou but he didn't know me very well; wondered what the devil I wanted\ntrying to talk to him and how I got here.\"\n\"Yes, he remembers his watch-it's in poasession of Robert. He used to\ncall him Bob. (Took watch ill hands.) Ha! well, this watch came from\nRussia-yes-Uncle Jerry said so.\" [Unlikely.]\n\"I say, those were insurance papers, those thinga I told you about,\ninsurance papers with seals on them. Do you know 1\"\nO. L. : \"No, I don't.\"\n\"Well, you tell that to Bob, he'll know all about it.\" [No.]\n\"Jerry tells me he had a ring which he used to wear on little finger of\nleft hand; it had a little stone, a stone, a carbuncle in it. The stone had a\nlittle nick in it (on one side 1), it came from Italy. A clumsy thing. He says\nhe tells this and will tell other things to prove hill identity to Bob, and let\nhim know he's there. All specific facts he will tell him. [In saying this\nsentence Phinuit curiously imitated the manner of U. J.] They used to put\na coat with a strsp on over hill shoulder and play at soldiers, and they got\nshut up in a room once and couldn't get out, the key wouldn't tum, and they\nhad a job to get them out.\"\nO. L. : \"Where was that 1\"\n\"Wait a bit, I'll ask him. That wasatyourgrsndmother's, athillhoDle.'\u00b7\n[None of this can I get verified.

But when the writing was\ndone on paper held to Mrs. Piper's forehead, i.e., with the hand turned round\n-pencil towards face-as in the present instance, the writing was ordinary.\nThe handwriting is hardly good enough for me to identify it with my aunt's,\nor to discriminate it securely from Mrs. Piper'll.\nC. I have since asked at Highgate whether my father had been there lIot\nlong before he died, and one of my cousins at oncc replied, \"Ycs, it was th..\nlast place he went to,\" exactly in Phinuit's words (p. 514).

Most of the com-\nmunications purporting to come from my uncle Jerry answered per-\nfectly to this description, and the only difficulty was to get them\nverified. As indicated in Note E, p. 516, my uncle Robert (sur-\nviving twin brother of 'Uncle Jerry) has verified the snake's skin, but\n2 0\nDigitized by Google\n\fA Record of Observations of\n\/ \/ he could only remember indistinctly the episode of swimming the creek\n\/ and nearly getting drowned, on which stress was laid by Phinuit (first\n\/ mentioned p. 503), and had no recollection of some other incidents.\nBut he was good enough to write to the only other surviving\nbrother of those concerned, living in Cornwall, and by this means to\nobtain for me, what by no other means I should have been likely to\nobtain, the following document, which I copy and print in full. The\ncommunication from U nele Robert to Uncle Frank was a bald list of\nquestions, not likely to excite pseudo-memory. The family WIlS an\nenormous one, and my father was one of the youngest members of it.\nHe was born in 1826; his father at the time being 61, and U nele Jerry\nbeing 16. The family left Barking for Elsworth in 1838 or 1839. I\nwas born in 1851.\nStatement made by U nele Frank to Uncle Robert, received by me\nFebruary 2nd, 1890 (see end of No. 80, below, p. 542):-\n\" About the summer of the year 1828, I am not sure of the date within &\nyear or two, a large party (those forming it as far as my memory serves me\nbeing Messrs. Wm. Whitbourne, James Sharpe, Henry Sharpe, Fnmk Whit-\nbourne, my brothers Robert, Jeremiah, Charles, and myself, and some others\nwhom I cannot recollect without help)left Barking,80me inHenrySharpe's boat\nand others walking to lIford, the object being to beat the River Rodin from\nIIford to Barking, and catch a large lot of fish in nets arranged for the pur\u00b7\npose at the Six Gates. We did beat the river, wading where depth of water\nadmitted, and swimming the deep parts, the non-swimmers walking along'\n.the banks of the river. The whole thing was a failure, for we caught only a\nvery few fish, and concluded that they had managed to slip past us on the\njourney. On arriving at Barking the elders of the party went home to bet\ndry clothes, and the young ones commenced the usual rough play. Jerry and\nI were larking together on the tailboard of the water-mill; one pushed tho\nother and sent him down the slippery platform, and then there was a struggle\ntogether, which resulted in both being sent into the mill-stream, which was\nrunning fast owing to the six gates being open. There was nothing left but\nto swim with the stream to a bank about three or four hundred yards off.\nWe had all our clothes on except shoes and stockings.\nThe quays at Barking were crowded with people, men, women, and\nchildren, drown there to see a smack launched. These good people made a\ngreat noise, some cheering the swimmers in the mill pool, others screaming\n\"They will be drowned,\" \"They will be drowned.\" One of them, viz., a\nMr. Smith, a publican, looked over the quay; I saw his face quite plain and\nheard him say, \u2022\"That's the odds if they are, it's only two of them d-d young\nLodges.\" As we were swimming our best my hat washed or got off and W3.'i\nleft behind a yard or two, and as soon as I missed it I swam back aud\nrecovered it, much to the amusement of the onlookers. We got all right to\nthe landing-place and even thought of endeavouring to 8wim back again\nagainst the stream.\nJerry had a rifle such as you describe (p. 515), at the Palladium, but I\n[know] nothing about it. I was only home once while he was at the Palla<liunl,\nand then only for a very short time.\nDigitized by Goo~\n\fOertain Phenomena of T'l'ance. 527\nI remember nothing of the snake skin.\nI know nothing of his making any calculations, by wheels or otherwise.\nI remember his having an old repeater-how he came by it I do not\nknow-it was often requiring the watchmaker, yet Jerry seemed to value it\nvery much.\nI never recollect a photo with you and Jerry together (p. 503).\nI recollect there was a field at Barking called Smith's field. I think it\nwas the field at the top or upper part of Glenny's Part, and bounded part\nof the pond we used to fish in. It was half field and half garden (p. 517 ;\nsee also p. 556).\nThe only cat-killing I can remember is our brother Charles killing Mrs.\nCannon's cat and burying it behind one of the lilac trees (pp. 517,521,541).\nOnce more, I must repeat that the importance attaching to the\nreferences made in the sittings to these events must depend very much\non the view taken of the genuineness of the trance and of Mrs. Piper's\nhonesty. Given that she is a cheat, she must be supposed a chest of\nexceptional ability and with the command of very superior assistance ;\nand it is just conceivable that such a one, by sending a skilled agent\ndown to Barking and interviewing the oldest inhabitants, might hit\nupon someone who as a boy had witnessed the creek episode. The\ntask does not strike me as an easy one, but possibly it might be done.\nIt is impossible to suppose that Mrs. Piper herself made effective\ninquiries, because her proceedings all the time in England were well\nknown, and she was under bargain to sit regularly every day.\nHaving obtained her information she would proceed to lead up to it by\nfrequently mentioning my uncle who had a fall; just in the way that\nPhinuit did. It was doubtless this frequent reference that caused me\nto think of sending for the watch and getting more details. The cat\nincident, and the rifle, may be dismissed as shots; and I suppose the\nwatch-scratches and the snake skin can be eluded somehow.\nSo much a sceptic might he allowed; though in the fa.ce of what\nseems to me such extreme improbabilities that only the improbability of\nany other conclusion enables one to face them with patience.\nBut when the interviews with strangers are contemplated in addi-\ntion, interviews which compel assent to some abnormal powers, and\nthereby remove any necessity for the exercise of an elaborate and\ncostly system of imposture, then I confess that for my own part I am\neven more sceptical of the power of any human being to obtain the\ninformation by ordinary means and under the given circumstances\nthan I am of the possibility of the possession by the human mind of\nlatent or nascent powers hithel'to only obscurely recognised and imper-\nfectly developed. (See Appendix, p. 555.)\nFurther Notes. September, 1890.\nThere are one or two further annotations which I am able now to\nmake.\n'202\n\f528 A Rec01'(l of Obsel>t'atio1l8 of\nWith regard to the marks 011 Uncle Jerry's watch (p. 518), it appears\nfrom a letter below that it is unlikely that, he made them himself,.\nand accordingly if any importance is to be attached to their\ndetection by Dr. Phinuit inside the certainly unopened case, it is.\nprobably of the directly percipient or clairyoyant order, rnther than, as\nhe represented it, of information receh'ed and transmitted as a message.\nThe same letter likewi'*l casts some doubt on the importance of the-\n\"fall from a hOl'Se\" so frequently mentioned (e.g., p. 521). I clearly\nremember having been told when a boy of Uncle Jerry having had a\nserious fall which inflicted some injury to the spine, and was the-\nprobable cause of his blindness. Hence it would appear likely that\nthis item may ha\"e been extrncted by Dr. Phinuit from my mind~\nunless further information confirms its position as a really influential\nevent. (See also notes at end of Second Series, p. 557.)\nThe letter is from my cousin, eldest son (If Uncle Robert, senior t~\nme, and much more intimate with the London branch of the family\nthan I eyer was.\nE.dract from letter.\nGreat Gearies, Dford, Septcflwer 16th, 1890.\nAs you wished me to semI you notes of anything that struck me in the\nreport of Mrs. Piper's sittings-here goes.\nUncle .Jerry died on the 12th March, 1869. 1 have always understood\nthat his blilldne88 was attributed to locomotor ataxy, and 1 never heard of his\nhaving 80 bad a fall from his horse as you mention in your notes. He had a\nslight fl,ll once in Rotten Row, 1 think, and 1 remember his telling me that\nas a piece of affectation he appeared in the Row the next day with one foot\nin a slipper, having spmined hisllonkle.\n1 remember his having a rifle and sword which he kept in his business\ndesk at the Palladium, as he at that time belonged to a rifle club (it was long\nbefore the Volunteer movement), and perhaps that is what is meant by\n.. playing at soldiers.\" 1 do not remember any snake skin (p. 516).\nThe marks on the watch 1 do not think were made by him, as I cannot\nremember his having a repeater until he lost his sight. The tenu .. little\nshaver\" (p. 503) fits hill method of expre88ion to a T. The swimming t.be-\ncreek, &c., &c., have been so well deacribed by the skipper that 1 need\nonly say 1 knew of its having been done from both (I believe) of the-\nperfomlers.\n(Signed) RoBBRT LoDGB.\nThe other incident in fayour of direct clairvoyance and against\nthought-trnnsference of any recognised kind, ,\u00b7iz., the experiment\ncontrived by l\\1r. Gonner (pp. 462 and 487), has had its value rather-\nstrengthened by further inquiry and by interview with the ladies\nconcerned in London. It was a carefully arranged experiment.\nplanned by him and me together in Liverpool, and carried out in &\nsatisfactory manner through the kind aid of his relations in :LQndon_\nDigitized by Google\n\fCertctin Phenom,ena of Trnnce. 529\n'The problem was to remove thought-tmnsference to as many orders of\n~-emoteness as possible. He therefore wrote to his sistel', Miss Gonner,\ngiving hel' full particulars of what was wanted, Their mother was to be\nrequested to decide on and do something uncommon at a specified hour,\nwithout letting lIiss Gonner know what it was; neither was she to\nhave any inkling whatever as to a I'eason for the request, nor to know\nthat it was connected with her son. I find that all this was scrupu-\nlously done, With the aid of Miss Ledlie (the lady correctly described\n.and named as \"Annie\" by Phinuit), who likewise knew nothing\nwhatever as to reasons, the mother was prevailed upon to accede\nto the request; and she accordingly decided to go out under\nperfectly unlikely circumstances, accompanied by Miss Ledlie, both\nladies being very much puzzled to account for the singular and vague\nrequest on the part of :Miss Gonner. The latter lady, who was the\nonly one of the tl'io who had any idea of the reason, purposely\n.absented herself fl'olll the house before any decision was made as to\nwhat should be done. The dli.ving round the park on a wet Saturday\nmorning, though sufficiently incongruous to astonish even the cab-\nman, was an unfortunately passive kind of pel-fonnance to select; but\nconsidering the absence of every kind of infonnation or clue to the\nI'eason for doing anything, the wonder is that anything whatever was\n<lone. Miss Ledlie reports that aft~r lIiss Gonllel' had left the house\n.she and Mrs, Gonner decided what to do, and a vehicle was sent for.\nJust about 11 she ran upstairs to see if )frs. HOlmer was ready,\n.and saw her come out of her I'oom to a landing cupboard, take a box\n.out of it, put it on a ledge, open it and take out a muff, very much as\n.described by Phinuit half an hour later. She had hill' clo.c'tk and\nthings on then, and the cloak is troublesome to hook, so that there\nwould be a good deal of apparently fixing things round the neck. The\ntaking up and looking at the photogmph would almost certainly\nhe done befol'e going out, though it was not actually seen. The\n'\" taking up a pencil to writ~,\" and the \"brushing something,\" if by\n\"something\" is meant a garment, are unlikely actions. Although the\nsuccess was far fl'om complete, Phinuit distinctly left us in Liverp(xll\nwith the impression that \"going out\" was the thing selected to be\n.done.\nThe episode of Miss Le(Hie's hair not having heen cut short, when\n)[r, Gonner, having heen told in fun that it had, felt dissatisfied with\nPhinuit's reply (p, 489) implying that there was nothing special to say\n~'tbout its length-dissatisfaction which he expressed to me,-is likewise\n\u00b7good as against ordinary thought-transfel'lmce,\nThe incident at the beginning of Sitting :No. 48, about\" Charley\n.eating a bird,\" is also rather striking, I <lid not think much of it at\n>the time because it seemed an unlikely thing to get dist.inctly verified;\n\f530 .A Record of Observati0'fl8 of\nbut, as recorded in the note at end of sitting (p. 520), special cir-\ncumstances connected with it happen to have made it a definite\nincident clea.rly remembered.\nSecond Serie8.\nAfter an interval, during which we went abroad, Mrs. Piper\nvisited us again on her way back to the States. She was now not so\nwell in health, apparently rather fatigued by her stay in London,.\nwhich she imagined did not suit her, and beginning to long to get.\nhome again. On the whole I think the lucidity of \"Dr. Phinuit\" was\nless than it was during the earlier series ; the communications from\nmy uncle, for instance, add very little to the facts previously given;\nand the\" George Wilson\" episodes, referred to on p. 461, which at the\ntime seemed likely to furnish satisfactory positive evidence in favour of\nclairvoyance, have turned out in the opposite sense, as the following\nletter clearly indicates :-\nLetterfrom Mr. WilBOn, abroad.\nApril 2nd, 1890.\nMy DBAR LoooB,-Your letter with enclosure reached me as I was\nleaving -- and I could do nothing till I arrived here. And now, after\nconsideration, I think I shall say but little.\nThe statements made through the medium fall into two classes: (1) Th080\nwhich relate to matters known to you. (2) Those you could not know-as.\nfor example, either my present circumstances or my past life. What is said\nunder the fonner head is, as you would see, more or 1888 correct. What is\nsaid under the latter is entirely incorrect. Were you here I would go into\ndetail, but as you have not the MSS. this could nut easily be done. On the\nmatter generally I pass no opinion. The evidence is too narrow.\nAnd, in general, the kind of old man represented is the antipodes of the\ndignified precise character of my father. He was calm and clear-headed,\nhated all fUSB, and, like most of the Govenlment officials, avoided all publia\nappearances. He detested bad grammar, and drew up Government papers\nof almost painful accuracy.\nAdded &ptember, 1890.\nRecently, my wife has suggested that some of the statements\u00b7 seem to-\nrefer more probably to my grandfather, whose name was James, and who\nwas somewhat of a .. havering\" old man, such as is represented. I am not\n\"ble to verify the statements from this point of view, but he did own hia.\nhouse, and very likely made lOme additions to it [as stated on p. 543].\nSubsequently I got him to return his copy of the evidence with\nannotations, and these are transcribed into their appropriate places\nbelow, beginning at p. 539.\nDuring the second series of sittings my sister E. C. L., frequently\nmentioned in the first series, was with us on a short visit, and ofteo.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOe'rtain Plunomena of Trance. 531\ntook notes for me. There was a good deal of repetition of statements\nmade in the earlier series, and though I abbreviate the notes as much\nas possible so as to print only the more apparently evidential portions,\nI quote some of these repetitions in full, especially all those having\nreference to my Uncle Jerry, because at this time a number of the\nfacts had not been verified, and some are still unverified. The letter\nof partial verification from Uncle Frank to Uncle Robert, printed above,\nreached me about the middle of the second series; and I read it to\nPhinuit on the day it arrived, as reported below. Mrs. Piper arrived\nfrom London on January 30th, and next day was held a sitting, which\nnumbers itself 71 in the entire English series.\nSitti119 No. 77. (First after it.terml.)

She said I had passed through a lot of difficulties, was a rum fellow, had\n11ad many troubles and trials, was a good man.\nHere she asked Lodge to leave the room. She then told me accurately\nwhat children I had-one boy who at this very time was absent and ill-\n-eldest girl inclined to domineer-second girl deyoted to music-third girl\nwould need much watching. For myself, had had throat trouble [correct],\nwhich would trouble no more. Head now the greatest fear. Surrounded by\npeople who wished to do me harm, especially one dark man [unknown].

He's a very_\nhl\\l'd man. He would hardly believe me.\"\nThen came some account of what I was Baying in my sermon (p. 541).\n\"Do you know who Joseph and Harriet are 1-Something in connection\nwith him.\" [Unknown.]\nNotes by Mr. Lund.\nWith regard to my experience of Mrs. Piper, I do not feel that I IlaW\nenough to form data for any aatisfactory conclusion. What impressed IDe\nmost. was the way in which she seemed to feel for information, rarely telling\nme anything of importance right off the reel, but carefully fishing, and then\nfollowing up a lead. It seemed to me that when she got on a right tack.\nthe nen\u00b7ous and ullcontrollable movement of one's muscles gave her the\nsignal that she was right and might steam ahead.\nIn some points she was entirely out of it-e.g., carriage accident-the\ndauger01I3 cla'rk man-Joseph alld Harrkt-and especially, my style of\npreaohing. Nothing could be a more ludi.rous caricature than this last.\nIn others, which I will name, she made statements which singularly\ntallied with the truth-e.g., my son '!CaB ill, and my wife was going to see\nhim. I found that at the very time given she left the house with a cloak\non h~r ann, and \/mIMed her drtM in the way imitated by Mrs. Piper.\nStill I am bound to say that within earshot of Mrs. Piper-before the\nsitting-I told Mrs. Lodge of my son's illness in Manchester, and my wife'~\nproposed visit to him, and Mrs. L. addreBBed me by my '&ame of Lund.\nIt is quite true that a carpet was recently burnt at our house; that my\nDigitized by Google\n\fCel'iain Phen01nena of Trance. 535\nwife worries over her duties too much for comfort and health ; that I live in\na room full of M88.\nBut without doubt the feature of this sitting was the reference to my\nyoungest sister, who died of diphtheria in my absence quite 30 years ago~\nand whose death was a heartaching sorrow of many years. Not only did\nshe hit the name \"Maggie,\" but even the pet name \"Margie,\" which I\nhad quite forgotten. However, the reason afterwards alleged for my absence\nat her death was quite wrong.\nI accepted the trance condition on Dr. Lodge's authority; otherwise I\nshould have felt bound to test it.\nAltogether there was such a mixture of the true and false, the absurd.\nand rational, the vulgar commonplace of the crafty fortune-teller with\nstartling reality, that I have no theory to offer-merely the above facts. I\nshould require much more evidence than I yet have, and with much more\ncareful testing of it, to convince me (1) that Mrs. Piper was unconscious ;\n(2) that there was any thought-reading beyond the clever guessing of a\nperson trained in that sort of work; (3) that there was any ethereal com-\nmunication with a spirit-world. I did not like the sudden weakness\nexperienced when I pressed my supposed sister for the reason of my absence\nat her death, and the delay wanted for giving a reply.\nThat the subject is Cull of interest I admit, and I should like to pursue\nit; but I am far from convinced at present that we have evidence on which\nto build a new theory.\nApnl 26th, 1890.\nT.

ALBERT SMITH.\nADDITIONAL NOTES.\nOctober 23rd, 1890.\nIn order to obtain verification or the opposite for as lllany of the state-\nDlents regarding things unknown to me 1\\8 possible, I wrote at ll\\st to Illy\nuncle Frnnk in Cornwall (p. 5~6), informing him fully of the circumstances\n<)f the investigation and requesting his aid. He compll\\ins that his memory\niH not so good now as it was even six months ago, but he hllH favoured llle\nwith some infonuation which is useful so far as it goos. The following\nJ\\re extracts from his letters ;-\n(Referring to episode mentioned on p. 500.) .. I re~ollect very well my fight with\na boy in the cow\u00b7field. It took place when I was ten yeare old (about 1822), and I\n.suppose a bit of a boy\u00b7bully. We had no quarrel but merely fought to see which\nwas best man, and when my opponent considered he had had enough, instead of\ngiving in in the usual manner, he bolted like a lamp\u00b7lighter. The reason I remember\n.80 well about this is because before the fight the general opinion was that the othE'r\nboy would beat me easily, and as a result of my success a boy two years older and\nmuch bigger and stronger than myself was picked out from the village to fight me,\nand gave me a tremend'Jus thrashing.

It was remarkable, as compared with those which have-\nnow to be considered, for a high level of success. At Cambridge, as in\nLondon, success and failure alternated in a puzzling manner. In a.\nlarge number of ca.<;es particles of intuition were f.>mbedded in a mass\nof vague, uninteHigible, or distinctly \"fishing\" conversation. The-\nsittings, however, have the advantage of throwing a great deal of light\nupon the working of the medium's secondary personality, and desen\u00b7e-\ntheref.,re as careful study as those of more uniform quality. The plan\nadopted in dealing with them has been to set out first the most remark-\nable from an evidential point of view, and- then a few of those which\ngive the most unfavourable side of Dr. Phinuit's personality; for as a.\ndistinct personality we shall have to regard him. The remainder are\ncollected in the Appendix in an abbreviated form.\nBefore entering upon details, it is necessary to give a general view\nof the conditions under which the London sittings took place. Mr_\nMyf.>rs has already done this for Cambridge. In London the same-\nprecautions were of course taken to introduce all sitters, not previously\nknown to 1\\1rs. Piper, under feigned names. The possibility of gaining\ninformation by local gossip, which has to be taken into account in\nCambridge and even in Liverpool, was here excluded by the circum-\nstances of the case ; and the same may be said of another supposed\nsource of information, that by inquiry from servants. The first nine-\nsittings were held at MI\"S. Piper's lodgings, No. 2;, Montagu-stree~\nW.C. The owners of the lodgings could not possibly have known\nanything of Dr. Myers, by whom the arrangements were madf.>_\nWhen Mrs. Piper came to London for the second time, she was l<)(lged\nat a private hotel not far from my residence, where the possibility of\ninformation was equally excluded. She sat several times at my house,\nand dined there on one occasion ; but she was under close observation\nan the timf.>, and it is perfectly certain that she had no chance of\n\" pumping\" any of the servants, nor indeed are any of the statement&\nwhich she made such as could possibly be accounted for by such\nc1l1Ulnels of information. One sitting, perhaps the most remarkable of\nthe series, took place at Mr. Clarke's house at Harrow. Here it may-\nbe said that there was II. possible source of inquiry; for Mrs. Piper had\nnot only met Mr. Clarke in America, but had crossed the Atlantic 00.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOe'1'ictin PhenOrfte'lUt of Tr\u00a3l1'U'e. 559\nthe same steamer with him; and it will be suggt'sted, no doubt, that\nshe had succeeded in pumping him as to his wife's family in the course\nof conversation. That any man could have imparted unconsciously\nsuch curious and unusual family histories as those told to 1\\Irs. Clarke\nwould be amazing enough. The supposition is simply impossible to those\nwho have had the opportunity of watching 1\\Irs. Piper, and estimating the\nsingularly limited range of her conversation, and its inadequacy for the\nsubtle designs attributed to it. Moreover, some of the facts stated were\nunknown to Mr. Clarke himself till he heard them asserted by the\nmedium and confirmed by his wife. Both Mr. and Mrs. Clarke are\nintimately known to me ; and no better evidence than theirs could\npossibly be desired. Mrs. Clarke is a German by birth, and has been\nin England only since her marriage. The facts stated to her refer\nentirely to members of her family in Germany. Nothing short of a\ndetective employed by Mrs. Piper in Munich would have availed to\nget her the knowledge which she showed.on the occasion of her sitting\nwith Mrs. Clarke.\nThe Same may be said of the only two other London sittings which\nare published at length, as being of evidential importance. My sister-\nin-law, Mrs. H. Leaf, was introduced to 1\\Irs. Piper at the lodgings\nin Manchester-street, where Mrs. Piper had arrived the day before,\nand was immediately told a number offacts of almost all of which I was\nmyself quite ignorant, as they referred to various cousins of hers whose\nnames I had not to my knowledge ever heard. Mr. Pye is a friend\nwhom I have known for many years, but of whose family I know only\none or two members. What was stated to him was entirely outside\nmy own knowledge. Of the other sittings the most remarkable was\nundoubtedly Miss\" Gertrude C.'s.\" As will be seen from her report,\nAppendix, Nos. 29 and 31, the best part of this was of so private a\nnature that practically very little can be published. Of the facts which\nhave had to be reserved it is quite clear that no means, not even the\nmost astute detective, could have obtained knowledge of them; they\nwere secrets which were the property of one, or at most of two or\nthrea persons.\nIn addition to this there is the conviction which I strongly feel, in\ncommon, I think, with all those who h8\\\"e seen much of Mrs. Piper,\nthat she is absolutely honest. This of course refers to her nonna}\nstate; as to the view to be taken of the Phinuit personality there will\nbe more to be said hereafter. But as to the first and most obvious\nquestion, whether she consciously acquires knowledge with regard to\nher sitters, with the intention of deceiving, I may say most positively\nthat I regard such a supposition as entirely untenabll;l.\nThe question of the amount of communication existing between the\ntwo states is in the nature of the case obscure, and the evidence, so far\n2 Q 2\nDigitized by Google\n\fl560 .A Recm-d of ObBe'f'1-'CttiO\"n8 of\nas I h&\\'e been able to see, is mainly negative. Dr. Phinuit makes many\nstatements which may easily have been learnt by Mrs. Piper; he in\nseveral cases, for instance, took pains to describe the personal appeal'-\nance of his sitters. On the other hand, knowledge about them and their\nsurroundings, which Mrs. Piper certainly possessed, was not as a rule\ngiven by Phinuit. It may of course be said that this was done in order\nto obscure his methods, and I am inclined, judging fl-om what I have\nseen of the character of Phinuit, his shrewdness and his desire to\nappear marvellous, to t.hink that this is very possible; though it seems\nsomewhat inconsistent with the different course taken by him in the\ncases just mentioned, and still more with his habit of noting correc-\ntions or hints given him during a sitting, and attempting to bring\nthem out after a short interval as though they were his own. One\nobservation bearing on this point. was made by Mrs. Verrall. In her\nthree sittings, her eldest girl was frequently mentioned, but her name,\nwhich she had never mentioned to Mrs. Piper, was not given. After\nher last sitting, No. 63, she purposely took an opportunity of calling\nthe child\" Helen\" in Mrs. Piper's presence. At the very next sitting\nwhere Mrs. Verrall was mentioned, that of Mrs. B., No. 66, Helen was\nnamed by Dr. Phinuit. There is therefore ground for supposing that,\nas in the case of other secondary personalities which have been studied,\nthe abnormal state is conscious of what goes on in the normal, but not\nvice versa; but that this connexion is purposely obscured. That Dr.\nPhinuit is what he gives himself out, the spirit of a departed Marseillais\nphysician, I may say at once that I do not see the least ground for\nbelieving. His own word does not, in view of his moral standard, apart\nfrom other considerations, carry even a presumption of veracity; nor\nhas a single one of the numerous statements he has made as to his life\non earth proved capablc of verification. On the other side his complete\nignorance of French is a positive ground for disbelieving hiDI, and one\nwhich he has never been able to explain.\nPhinuit in fact exhibits just the low moral tone which we so often\nfind in table-talking, planchette, and other manifestations, as we now\nregard them, of the secondary self. He swears freely, and indulges in\nslang of the vulgar New England sort, in a way quite alien from the\nmanners of Mrs. Piper. This is of course a trifle; but it is more serious\nwhen we find him continually making attempts to deceive. If he is\nnot able to make a right statement, he is always ready with a guess of\nmore or less ingenuity to conceal his ignorance, or at least with some\nambiguity or subterfuge which should make a show of turning the\ndifficulty. Hardly a sitting passed without his making at least a. few\nstatements which were altogether wrong. It is this which consti-\ntutes the chief obstacle to coming to a positive dedsion as to many of\nthe facts.\nDigitized by Google\n\fCertain Phe'twmena of Trance. 561\nWe must therefore attempt to give some idea of the methods which\nwere employed to obtain direction from the sitters in case correct\nknowledge fa.iled ; or, if this information could not be extracted, to\nmake lucky guessing supply its place. For this purpose two of the\nworst sittings have been given fully, that the reader may form his own\nOpinIOn. Miss Johnson's first sitting has also been published, with 1\\\ncommentary which will show how hard it is to be sure that fishing does\nnot enter into statements which may at first seem satisfactory.\nIn thus taking the part of an advocatu8 diaboli, and pressing to the\nutmost all objections which can be urged against the genuineness of\nthe phenomena, it is almost inevitable that one should give a somewhat\nmisleading perspective of the impression which the evidence has pro-\nduced upon a spectator. In order so far as possible to correct this\nimpression at the outset, I repeat with all emphasis that the c:on-\njectural analysis of Phinuit's methods is very far from covering all the\nstatements which he made. His supposed fishing was employed, if at\null, only when the supernormal power was for a time in abeyance;\npossibly it is only an imagination of my own. But even with all risk\nof being misunderstood, it seems essential that this side should be put\nforward, if only to show that the investigators were fully alive to all\nthe various methods by which it might be possible to take advantage\nof their cl\u00b7ellulity or careles'Iness. The more I consider the whole of\nthe evidence, the more I remain convinced that it gives proof of a real\nsupernormal power, subject, however, under conditions at which we can\nhardly even guess, to periods of temporary eclipse.\nUnfortunately it is not possible to reduce the chances of a right.\nguess to anything like numel\u00b7ical values. In a few cases only can we\neven {Ol\u00b7m an approximation. Take, for instance, a favourite state-\nment: \"You have a father and mother, one (or both) in the body\n(or, in the spirit),\" as the case may be. Here evidently the possible\nalternatives are four, and the chances against a right guess would seem\nto be three to one. But it is evident that the apparent age of the\nRitter would give a certain additional help to a guess. In some cases,\nwith an elderly sitter, the statement, \"You have both parents in the\nspirit,\" would be almost a certainty.\nSo again with the case of names. Phinuit wa.'! not fond of giving\nsurnames, but at times he did so. Sometimes he was strikingly right;\natotller times he condescended to such phrases as \"You know Smith,\"\nor \"How is Harris 1\" with less success than might have been expected.\nBut it is hopeless here to attempt to say what the chances of success\nare. In the case of Christian names the case is not really better. 1\u00a3\nwe had to deal only with utterances such as \" Then I get a William,\" or\n\"There is a Henry in your surroundings,\" we might have formed some\nrough idea of the proportion of persons of whom this would be true.\nDigitized by Goo~\n\f562 .A Record of Observations of\nBut the case becomes hopeless when this sort of thing is mixed up with\n\"You have a brother John; no-a brother-in-law.\" It is only possible\nto record the fact that such expressions were frequently used, that they\nwere sometimes successful and sometimes wrong, and that they are so\nobviously tainted with the suspicion of being used for purposes of\nfishing that t.hey are of no value as evidence. A rough counting of the\nnumber of Christian names given shows that William was the most\nfrequent, and the most often right; but this is only what would be\nexpected on the hypothesis either of fraud or of imperfect though\nauthentic information, since 'William is the commonest male Christ.ian\nname in England. &)lne names were, however, given with a frequency\nwhich leads to the supposition that they were systematically employed\nfor fishing with. One of them is Alec or Alex, which met with much\nmore success than would have been supposed likely in a series of sittings\nheld south of the Tweed. Another name was\" Ed.\" This was one of\nthe commonest. As Mr. Barkworth points out, it has the advantagl' of\nstanding for the four names Edward, Edwin, Edgar, and Edmund.\nOnce, when none of these was recognised by a sitter, it was apparently\nturned into \"Head\"; \"what's the matter with head 1\" (p. 487).\nAnother name is \"Loo,\" which has the useful property of standing at\nneed either for a woman, Louisa, or a man, Louis. Cases in which it\nwas successful in both functions will be found among the records.\nA certain vagueness and imperfect.ion of pronunciation, consistent\nwith Phinuit's assumption of French origin, was also taken advantage\nof in order to increase the latitude with which names could be changed\nfrom one to another. Thus .Vary was always called Ma\u00b7ri.e, which\nevidently made it. easy to change to l\\iaria when necessary. Alice is made\nto do duty for Agnes (see Professor Rendall's sitting, p. 478), and in\nMiss Johnson's sitting (p. 609) it will be found that John is changed into\nGeorge by an ingenious process. It is of course possible that in these\nmsea the real reason of the uncertainty may have been that given by\nPhinuit, that his modes of obtaining knowledge were not clear; but as\nn matter of evidence we must assume that in all cases the changes were\nonly a means of obtaining direct information from the sitter.\nIt is probable that here a certain amount of muscle-reading was\ncalled into play as a guide to a right conclusion. The medium usually\nsat with the hand of the sitter pressed to her forehead. The attitude\nis a fll.Yourite one with so-called thought-reading performers. Uncon-\nscious indications would no doubt be given when the name first guessed\nwas anywhere near the mark, and would easily, by known methods, be\nfollowed up to a completely right conclusion. The same ml'ans may\nhave been used in the localisation of complaints. A very common\nstatement was that some relation of the sitter was lame in the knee,\nor still more commonly that he had rheumatism there. This was usually\nDigitized by Google\n\fCe-riain Plte'lwmena of T,'ance. 563\naccompanied by 0. grasping of the knee, which suggests muscle-reading.\nIn one case the suffering wo.s followed downwards and rightly located\nin the toe.1 At other times the pain wo.s said to be in the head-head-\naches or neuralgia. This wo.s equally accompanied by feeling over the\nlIitter's head. Not only are rheumatism and headaches two of the\ncommonest of complaints, and the most likely to be guessed right, but\nthe knee and the head were the most accessible portions of the sitter's\nframe, and those about which unconscious information could best be\ngiven. \"Suffering from a cold,\" too, wo.s a favourite diagnosis. As the\nsittings took place in December and January, and the later ones during\nthe height of the inftuenza. epidemic, it is not to be wondered at that\nthis was generally admitted to be correct.\nI have now gone through all the possible explanations of divination\nby fraud which after a careful study of the whole of the eyidence I am\nable to suggt.'st. It will be found that they are far from covering the\nwhole of the facts. But they will show that we must assume as worth-\nles.~ all single Christian names even when given o.s those of n. definite\nrelation. We can take names o.s positive evidence only when correctly\ngiven in series and without fishing.\nAnother peculiarity of Dr. Phinuit's, which does not tend to raise\nour opinion of his veracity, nor indeed of his shl'ewdUE\"ss, ho.s been\nnoticed by several sitters. This is that when a statement of his ho.s\nbeen corrected, or information directly given him, by the sitter, he\nwould take no notice of it at the time, but bring it out after a while as\nif it were an original piece of knowledge of his own. The device is too\ntransparent to need much notice, though, as Phinuit has had a large\nexperience of his business, it is likely enough that he has found it\nuseful at times.\nThere will of course be no presumption in favour of Phinuit's\n'Veracity when he represents the messages he gives o.s being told to him\nby the defunct friends of the sitter. The question whether this may\nnot after all be the eo.siest explanation is, however, definitely raised by\nthe material before us, and is by far the most serious point which we\nhave to face, It is our first duty to see if we cannot find an explana-\ntion without recourse to a supposition which is to most of us one of the\nleast probable that could be made.\nSetting o.side the hypothesis that Mrs. Piper in her normal state\nle:1.I'ns the facts which Phinuit communicate:!, as untenahle, and the\n.alternative, that Phinuit obtains them dUI'ing the sittings, partly hy\ningenious and systematic guessing, partly by help unconsciously\nfurnished to him hy the sitters, o.s insufficient, there remains a third :\n.that he ohtains them by n. process of thought-transference from the\n.sitter's mind.\n1 Set, No. 6!1, I>' 644; amI compare p. 610.\nDigitized by Google\n\f5640 A Reco,,,\/l of Observation.s of\nWill thought.transference then suffice to explain the whole of the\npuzzling facts which we have to deal with 1 My own belief is that it.\nwill. Indeed it is only in avery few cases that the question arises at.\nall. The primary point is naturally to know if the sitter was told\nanything which was nCJt and could not ha\\'e been within his own know-\nledge, but which yet turns out to be true. Nothing short of this will\ngive us a valid division between thought-transference and communi-\ncation fl\"Om intelligences other than our own.\nNow thought-transference in the pl'f.'sent case, if thought-transfer-\ncnce there be, is concerned,not with the normal consciousnellS, but ,,;t1.\nwhat we now call the sub-consciousness. It has nothing to do with\nthought-reading as commonly understood, in which it is necellSary that\nthe agent should steadily fix his thoughts upon the idea or picture\nwhich he desires to transfer to the mind of the percipient. The\nthoughts which are transferred are by no means, as a rule, those which\nwere uppermost in the sitter's mind at the time; the statements made\nare rather of old and often half-forgott.en facts, while distinct attempts.\nsometimes made by the sitter to obtain a deliverance as to particular\nmatters which he had vividly before him resulted as a rule-I cannot\nsay if always-in failure.\nNow we know little enough as yet about the sub-consciousness; but\nwe have at least good grounds for supposing that no impression once\nmade upon it is ever lost. The conscious memory is in itself no guide\nI\\S to what the contents of the sub-consciousness may 01' Dlay not ht>.\nThere is no need, therefOl't', to assume, at our present stage of know-\nledge, anything more than this unlimited retentiveness of the sub-\nconsciousness and the powel' of reading it, in order to account for the\nreproduction of anything whatever which may at any time have been\npresented to the consciousness. And who can say definitely what be\nlIlay not have beard in childhood, for instance, in the conversations of\nhis elders; things which he did not understand, and which may ha\\'e\nlong since passed out of the conscious memory of the elders themselves,\nif they still live and can be asked 1 There is nothing more wonderful\nin the supposed reproduction of such casual knowledge, thought-\ntransference once granted, than in the fl,miliar case of the Hebrew\nrepeated by the delirious peasant girl, learnt unconsciously from the\nrecitations of her fOI'mer master. Take, for instance, the messages sent\nby Unele Jerry to Pl'ofessor Lodge. The story of swimming the creek\nis striking enough, but what proof can there be that it was not told by\nUnele Jerry himself 01' one of his brothers to Professor Lodge in his\nchildhood 1 If it was, then in Professor Lodge's brain it must have\nheen ever since, ready to be deciphered by any intelligence possessed of\nthe means of reading a sub-consciousness. .\nThe assumption of thought-reading as a reality leads us farther, into.\nDigitized by Google\n\fCerta'in PhmuYTlum.a of Trance. 565\nl-eginns of pure hypothesis, which cannot, however, be ignored when such\nall alternative hypothesis is set up for our acceptance as the communi-\ncation of departed spirits with the living. If thought-transference is\npossible at all, it seems likely that it is a function of the under self, not;\nof the upper self, for it is in manifestations of the under self that we\nha.ve had our best experimental proofs; in the hypnotic sleep and ill\nautomatic writing, where the functions of the upper self are for the time\nsu!)pended. If then this under self, of whose workings we are only s()\nirl-egularly and so imperfectly conscious, has such susceptibility t()\nother minds at all, it is no wild assumption to suppose that it is\ncontinually receh\"ing impressions from other minds, indeed from every\nother mind in the universe, with varying clearness and force depending\n011 some condition.<; which we cannot at present even guess at. Only\nunder certain rare conditions do such impacts succeed in transferring\nthemselves to the upper consciousness, in the form of hallucination or\nautomatic action. Still more rarely do we find another sub-conscious-\nness so susceptible that, like an instrument of extreme delicacy, it is\nable to record the impression which such past impacts have made upon\nus\" The physical analogies of such n. solidarity of all minds are obvious\nellough, but must not be pressed. It is sufficient to say that, once\ngl\"anting the reality of thought-transference acting between strata of\npersonality of whose existence we are only sporadically conscious, such\na theory in itself contains nothing more bewildering or less conceivable\nthan the mutual interaction of all the material particles of the universe\nasserted in the law of gravitation.\nSuch a hypothesis would lead to the conclusion that we cali hav6\nno experimental proof of the existence of departed spirits. For there\ncan be no certainty that anything which was once in any human mind,\nevell if no longer in being, was not once recorded in another with\nclearness enough to enable its transmission and ultimate recovery.\nThe possibility of the existence of other than human intelligences\nstill would be within the rimge of proof; for it is quite conceivable\nthat knowledge might be conveyed to us which was never in any living\nhuman mind at all.\nThis, however, is not of vital importance for our present purpose; for\nso fn.r as I can see the few facts stated which the sitters declare were\nunknown to them at the time may all be explained either by successful\nguessing or by forgotten knowledge of childhood or of later years.\nStill, as the hypothesis of spiritual communication is in the field, it is\nwell to show that a natural, if as yet quite arbitrary, deduction from\ntheories which we believe to be proved will account for all phenomena\nwhich might be brought forward in support of the existence of disem-\nbodied spirits capable of mn.king themselves known to us.\nAmong the different sittings will be found a few cases of attempted\nDigitized by Google\n\f.566 A Reco\/\u00b7d of ObSe1'VatWJl.8 of\nclairvoyance-the description of actioi.s which were being performed\nat the moment by persons in a different place from that where the\nsitting was. These were in many cases complete failures. They gener\u00b7\nally referred to people well known to the sitter, and, where compara-\ntil'ely accurate, they hardly surpassed what might be explained by\nthought-transference from the sitter's mind, as he would naturally be\nable to give a pretty good guess. This, for instance, would explain the\naccount given to Mrs. Verrall in No. 63 ; she knew that it was the\ntime when her husband, a tutor of Trinity, would be likely to be seeing\nhis pupils. Miss Johnson, too, in No. 67, would have an idea of the\nprobable, or at least possible surroundings of her brother at the time.\nMrs. Sidgwick has reported upon the experiments which she and her\nhusband made together ; they cannot be considered very cogent, as it\nis impossible to apply any calculation of chances to them. The\naccount given to Mrs. B. of the actions of Mrs. Verrall, No. 66, is\nmore unusual in its charn.cter, but Mrs. B. is well acquainted with\nMrs. Verrall, and her experiments in \"crystal-gazing,\" so that a chance\ncoincidence is by no means out of the question. The most difficult\nof all these experiments to explain is that of Mr. Gonner's, p. 4&8,\nwhere the actions of his mother in London at the time, 01' rather a few\nmiuutes before, were told with a close approach to accuracy. Here\nagain, however, but for the a.o;surance that 1rlrs. Gonner was not in\nthe habit of going out of doors at the time referred to, one would have\nsaid that the action of putting on out-of-door clothing at 11 o'clock\na.m. was not beyond the possibility of a right guess. If, however, this\ntheory of mera guessing be not accept.ed, we should have to recur to\nthe idea of a real telepathic thought-transference operating at the\n'time from Mrs. Gonner to her son, and read as soon as the impression\nJ'eached the mind of the sitter, who thus acted at the same time as\npercipient and agent. There seems to me to be no a p1'iori ground\nJlgainst such an idea; but the experiments made were too few, and the\nlll'oportion of failures was too large to allow any weight whateyer to\nbe laid upon them.\nA word may be said as to the prophecies which were freely given\nto all the sitters, but which have been omitted from the sittings\nreported in brief, as having obviously no evidential mlue. Some of\nthem referred to the comparatively distant future, and haye not hacl\ntime to fulfil themselves. This, however, does not much matter, as some\nhave had their opportunity and have missed it, or at best haye fulfilled\nthemselves about as fairly as the forecasts of a sensible mall would be\nlikely to do. See, for instance, Mr. Clarke's Ilotes, Nos. 3, p. 569, and 21,\np. 5i2. There has not been It single case to indicate that Philluit\nhas any power of foretelling the future superior to that of his sitters.\nEverything, therefore, so far as I have yet seen, points to thought-\n\fOe'riai'lt Pltenomena of Trance. 567\ntransference being an adequate explanation of the phenomena, at least\nif we give to it the extension which has been indicated above, that\nPhinuit was able to detect mental impressions transferred to his sitters\nfrom those closely connected with them, and transferred at the very\ntime of the sitting. Several instructive incidents point directly\nagainst any knowledge derived from the spirits of the dead. For\ninstance, in Mrs. H. Leaf's first sitting a question was put about\n.. Harry,\" whose messages Phinuit purported to be giving: \"Did he\nleave a wife 1\"1 No answer wns given to this at the time, hut in\naccordance with Phinuit's frequent practice the supposed hint wa.<J\nstored up for future use; and at Mrs. H. Leafs next sitting she was\ntold, \"Harry sends his love to his wife.\"2 Now, as a matter of fact\nHarry never was married. In Mrs. B.'s second sitting and in Mrs.\nA.'s account of her brother's suffering in the arm, wrong facts were\nstated which corresponded to the sitter's belief. This evidently\nindicates thought-transference, not spiritual communication. See also\nMr. Clarke's note as to the statement that a man had been left to look\nafter his house in England, and as to his suspicions of his friend.' In\na few cases only sitters thought that the course of their own iden.s was\nfollowed as fresh ones were suggested to them by the remarks made by\nPhinuit ; but the evidence for this is naturally not clear. Mr. Pye\nmentions an instance in his report.'\nOn the whole, then, the effect which a careful study of all the reports\nof the English sittings has left in my mind is this: That Dr. Phinuit\nis only a name for Mrs. Piper's secondary personality, assuming the\nname and acting the part with the aptitude and consistency which is\nshown by secondary personalities in other known cases; that in this\nabnormal state there is a quite exceptional power of reading the\ncontents of the minds of sitters; but;. that this power is far from\ncomplete. It gets only glimpses of what is stored up in the memory,\nand this without any clear distinctioll of that which is present to the\nmind at the time from the forgotten memories, if the phrase may be\nused, of the past. The stray hints thus caught may sometimes fall\ntogethel' into consistent groups, in which case we have a successful\nsitting ; or, and this is more usual, they may present themselves only\nas fragtuents. Phinuit ~ excessively desirous of impressing himself\nupon his hearers as a being of superhuman powers; and when he gets\nbut fragmentary pictures he does not hesitate to piece them together\nwith guesswork, often of the wildest kind. Sometimes he gets not\neven a glimpse of what the sitter's mind contains; he then has recourse\nto guessing pure aud simple. In his guessing he shrewdly takes\nadvantage of help afforded him by his sitters, throwing out genel'llol\nI See p. 595. 3 pp. 571, 573.\n, See Appendix No. 53. ~ p.600.\nDigitized by Google\n\f568 A Record of Observations of\nstatements, and watching the effect they produce in order to guide\nhimself. It is probable, but by no means certain, that he also gets help\nfrom muscle-reading, chiefly in the location of complaints. He takes\nadvantage of any hints that may be thrown out, and attempts to dress\nthem up as statements of his own, bringing them out after an interval\nin order that their real origin may be forgotten. In short, he omits\nno means of disguising his ignorance, e,oen descending at times to\ndownright denial of what he has just said in order to cover a blunder.\nIt is unfortunate that the statements which he makes are rarely or\nne,oer of such a nature as to admit even an approximate application of\nthe doctrine of chances, especially as we have nothing like nrbatim\nreports of most of the sittings, and the amount of fishing can only be\nestimated when the exact words are known.\nThe reader must, however, fonn his own judgments from the reports\nthemselves, which we now proceed to giye. 'l'hey are mostly but\npartial accounts from rough notes made at the time, and in some cases\nsupplemented by the sitter's memory. But in order that a fair idea.\nmay be fonnecl of what a sitting was really like, one, that of Mrs.\nHcrbel1; Leaf, has been printed at length from shorthand notes, not\nindeed verbatim, but containing, I believe, almost everything that was\nsaid with the exception of the repetitions and inaccuracies of expression\nwhich are usual in conversation, and in no way affect the evidlmce.\nIt will be seen that there is a great mass of verbiage used apparently\nonly to fill up the time, and so far as can be judged not of the least\nimportance in the way of getting Phinuit any information. It would\nhave heen but a waste of trouble and expense to attempt n. reproductioll\nof this in every case. The same sitting will give a good example\nof the \"tailing off\" whieh was so often observed towards the end of a\nsitting, and which has been already noticed by Mr. Myers. It may be\nremarked that this is the opposite of what would have been expected\nif illformn.tion was mainly extracted from the sitters themselves;\nfor it would seem obvious that the more Phinuit guessed the better he\nwould be able to piece his knowledge together, so that the end of a\nsitting, like the last cards of a hand at whist, should show more know-\nledge n.nd less conjecture thn.n the beginning.\nWe take first the sitting of Mr. J. T. Clarke at Professor W.\nIn.mes's house n.t Chocorua, New Hampshire. Although this does not,\nstrictly spooking, belong to the English series, it is more conveniently\n!,riven here, as severn.l allusions were made to it in the subsequent\nsitting with Mr. and Mrs. Clarke at their house in Harrow. Mr.\nCln.rke was in September, 1889, on a hurried business visit to America.\nThough it would hn.ve been oosy for Mrs. Piper to acquire knowledge\nof his relations and friends in Boston, it will be seen that what was\nt<lld him was entirely about his English surroundings, of which she\nDigitized by Google\n\fCertain 'Phenomena of Tr(tnce. 569\ncould have learnt little or nothing on the other side of the Atlantic.\nHis wife and children have never been in America. The annotations\nare by Mr. Clarke..\nGhocorll~I., Nelo Hampshire, in MtC8e of D\/.. William Jamu,\nSeptember 20th, 1889.\nSitting with Mr. Clarke, Mr. Hodgson taking notes. Mr. Clarke fixes\nhis mind steadily upon a certain house, and visualises members of family;\nof this no recognition by medium, who begins:\nWhy! I know you! I have seen your influence somewhere before! what\nare you doing over here 1\n1. This secondary consciousness, the clairvoyant or thought.reading\nconsciousness of the medium, had become acquainted with my\nindividuality through frequent sittings with intimate friends. It\nhad seen me as thoy knew mo, under different surroundings. It had\nin former sittings with these friends made mention of me and of my\nmother.\nOh! there is lots of trouble over you, bla.ck clouds all over you ; but I\nsee light beyond; you will come out all right. It is financial trouble that I\nmean. You will wade through it all right in the end.\n2. Correct. My visit to America was determined by a financial failure,\nthe loss from which I was then endeavouring to minimise.\n\" How long hence 1\"\nFour months or four months and a\u00b7half. There are parties that hal'en't\nden.lt honourably with you.\n3. The prediction is, as the case has proved, valueless. As for the\naccusation against the \"parties\" referred to, we have in it a\npeculiarly interesting point. The statement in itself was absolutely\nuntrue. I was soon thereafter able to assure myself that the\naction of the men in question had been entirely honourable and\nloyal towards me and my interests, but Illy mind at the time\nundeniably entertained some apprehension lest the facts should\nprove to have been otherwise. This dread did not even amount to\na suspicion which I could have formulated, or would have admitted\nto myself, still less to others, and the detection of such a lurking\ndistrust is particularly interesting as an evidence of the closeness of\ncommunication existing between mind and mind, under this abnor-\nmal mental condition. Compare the similar case remarked upon\nin Note 15.\nI see your lady in the spirit, your mother,-have seen her before.\n4. As to the acquaintance of this secondary consciousness of the medium\nwith the individuality of my mother, see Note 1.\n(There followed a clear account of my own conception of my mother,\nrecently deceased, whose constant presence in my mind readily aecounta\nfor the frequent mentions of her.)\nYou've also got a lady in the body, your wife. You won't find her very\nwell.\n5. Prophecy wrong. My wife never better in health.\nDo you know a man named Williams-no, wait! Williamson 1 (Reply,\n.. No.\") Tall, rather dark, first llame Henery (sir). He will come into your\nsurroundings soon-he will have something to do with your papers and with\nDigitized by Google\n\f570 A Record of Obse1'Vati011,8 of\nlaw. He will look after your interests and get you out all right. You will\nmeet him very soon-within a few weeks.\n6. Interesting point. The name of the lawyerintrusted with the defenclll\nof my interests in the financial trouble before referred to, viz.,\nLamberlM.lII, had been communicated to me 10 days previous to the\nsitting. and was written down by me in a note-book. and then com-\npletely forgotten. I could not have correctly recalled it by an effort\nof the memory, but might have come about as near to it in sound and\nlength as did the clairvoyant. I have never known anybody\nnamed WilUltlllSml. The description of the personal appearance\nand the mention of the Christian name are consequently wholly\ngratuitous.\nPart of your intereat is in the ground ; you came near being \"left\" in in\nthis business, but are not altogether.\n7. Correct. Property consisted of a town lot and buildings, and I cer-\ntainly felt that I had come near losing it.\n\"Tell me about my mother.\"\nYour mother is with us. She is here and happy in the spirit.\nS. This, I take it, is the way that mediums, burdened with the conven-\ntional \"iews and the phrases customary in Spiritualistic circles, find\nit most natural to expre88 the conception which they receive from\nanother nlind of a person being a memory, an image of the mind M\nopposed to a living reality. That which is borne in my mind as a.\nvisualisation appears in the clairvoyant phraseology as a spirit.\nSee in this regard the indication remarked upon in Note 16. :\nWho is this M., your cousin 1 Your mother says she is not very well.\nShe is getting better, but she will continue weak.\n9. The health of the person referred to, tlwugh inlproved at the time,\nhad caused both myself and my mother much solicitude. I have\nnoticed, however, that the phrase, \" Your mother says\" or \"Your\nmother tells me\" has no particular significance. Witne88 the\ntrivial instance of the lost pocket-knife, to be mentioned later,\nNote 25.\n\"Can you sec my children ?..\nWait. Who is this about you that is musical, that plays the\npiano (imitating action of fingers) 1 Ah, it is your lady in the body. She is\nnot very well just now-she is suffering from rheumatism.\n10. My wife plays the piano much. As to her health, my own solicitude\nwas undoubtedly father to the prophecy, which was altogether\nwrong. My wife was well, and has never suffered from rheumatism.\n\" Do you see my children 1\"\nNo, not at all yet; I shall directly. Wait. Who is tIlls Fred that\ncomes together with your mother?\n11. A cousin lost at sea 10 years ago, under peculiarly shocking circum-\nstances. His death made a great imprussion upon me.\nIs he not your cousin 1\n\"Yes.\"\nHe comes with your mother. She knows him better now than she did\nbefore death. Who is this uncle of youl'll named John 1\n\"I have no Uncle John.\"\nYes, yes, you have-tlle man that married your aunt.\nDigitized by Google\n\fCertain Phen011H'l!o, of Trance. 571\n\"No, you are wrong; the man that married my aunt was called\nPhilip.\"\nWell, I think I know. (Changes subject, grumbling.)\n12. As the dialogue shows, I had entirely forgotten for the moment that\nnn aunt of mine hnd indeed man-ied a man named John, with whom\nI had fonnerly had some correspondence. I did not recollect this\nuntil the following day. This is a clear instance of the method in\nwhich the clairvoyant may dmw from the reservoir of our conscious-\nness, as it were, and can eyen recall to us facts which we have\ntemporarily furgotten.\n'Vhy ~ you are a funny fellow-you are covered with paint from head to\nfoot. Your mother says it is too bad.\n13. I had been much interested in painting the walls of a room, in the\nhouse of Illy friend, for some days previously.\nI'd like to know who this H. is, tlmt you are going to see. Take good\ncare of that man. He is a tricky une. Don't let him get you. into his\npower.\n14. This is an altogether unjust accuMtion, based upon an unwarrant-\nable distrust entertained by me at the time with respect t.o the\nfriend named, whom I had not seen for 14 years. This distrust\nwas soon removed altogether by a closer acquaintance with facts.\nThis case is precisely like that refen-ed to in Note 3. I should\ncertainly not ha\\\u00b7e been willing to admit that I felt suspicious\nof H., even to myself, still less to Imother. Yet here this unjust\nand ungenerous suspicion was proclaimed to me by the clairvoyant.\nand I canllot altogether deny its existence.\n(At thif:! point the medium Rpoke across the room to Mr. Hodgson, calling\nhim by name, and making some unimportant personal communications. Mr.\nHodgson was sitting at a distance of 20ft. from us, behind n screen. This\nleads to the interesting question how far and how easily the mind of the\nclairvoyant can be transferred from the sitter to another person. Can the\nclairvoyant infonn A of what is passing in the mind of B? This seems to\nme the most momentous problem before us. The recognition and direction\nof a power such as this nmy lead to a moral revolution ill the life of the\nhuman race.)\nHere is your Rebecca!\n(Clarke and Hodgson both a!lk \" mine\" 1 Each having relatives of that\nname.)\n(To Clarke) : Your Rebecca, your little girl. She runs around and gives\nl1er hand to everyone about her.\n\"Is there another little one with hed\"\nYes, there are three of your people together there now.\n15. My wife and two children.\n\"How is Rebecca 1\"\nVery well.\n\" Where is she now 1\"\nShe is in the spirit. That is to say, her !lpirit's here, but her body is at a\nciiRtance.\n16. A noteworthy instance of the way in which this tenn is used by the\nmedium. My child was in Germany at the time, and thus lived\n\f572 .A Record of Obsei'Vatw,Ul of\nrather in my memory than in my daily view. Hence. althout{h tho\nmedium felt that she was alive (\" Her body iK at a distance '). her\npersonality was yet spoken of as \"in the spirit.\" Compare Note 8.\nYou will soon have a surprise. It is a photograph of your boy that is\nbeing made for you. It is unfinished as yet, but will surprise you.\n17. An evident failure on the part of the medium to comprehend lIomo\nof my idel\\ll: I was at that time taking photogmphll which were not\nto be developed. and consequently could not be Keen. until my retun}\nto England. Hence a photograph appearll in her verllion as a lIurprille\nwhich some other person is preparing for mo.\nThere are five of you: yourRell, your two children, YOUl'lady in the bndy.\nand your lady in the spirit.\n18. This is my constant feeling-the \"we are 8e\\'en\" of my sur-\nroundings.\nWhat are these tickets that you have in your pocket I There are figures\non them stamped in red, and they are lIigned with nameK U1ulenleath. They\nwill be of value to you, you will get something out of them.\n\"No, I have nothing of the kind in my pocket.\"\n19. Knowing that I had left my }locket-book of P\"ptll'R elsewhere, I\ndenied having anything of the kind about me. I had forgotten for\nthe moment that I had, earlier in the day, taken two chequell to be\ncashed, and had thrust them into my itlllide }locket, folded Ill'.\nThese cheques were endorsed on the back as dellCribed, and were\nstamped with large and peculiar red numherll; I particuL,rly\nremember glancing at these numberll, and verifying the endorse-\nments. Another instance of underlying memory.\n\" Where is my wife 1\"\nShe is across country. She has been away.\n20. My wife had intended to go to Germany from England, soon after\nmy sudden departure for the United States. I ,lid not posith'ely\nk,Wl0 that she was away from home, but I shollld have asswued it as\nwell-nigh certain.\nThere is a young man and an old latly with her.\n(There followed an accurate interpretation of my estimate of the\ncharacters of these two persons, who I knew must be together with Illy\nwife.). . The young man is coming back again; he is going IItill\nmore across country.\n21. Correct. I knew that my brother\u00b7in\u00b7law had ttl return frum the\nTyrol to his hOllle on the Baltic.\n\u2022 (Further reference to my mother describing hel' character An,l\nrepresenting her as she lives in my memory.) \u2022 That is an old-\nfa!lhioned portmit of her, not very good, but better than lIuthing, (\" Where 1\n'Vhich one 1\") It is at home. I mean Ule one with the collarette.\n22. A sufficient indication of one of the few portmitll of my mother.\nWho is this funny-footed fellow of yours, the one with the club\u00b7feet and\nthe funny shoes 1 Your mother says it ill An injustice to yoII, too bRd-but\nit will come out all right.\nDigitized by Google\n\fCertain Phenomena of Trance. 573\n23. Correct. My boy was born with club-feet, and wears machine\nboots.\nWhy! you've changed your house recently.\n\"No.\"\nYes, your lady has changed her house.\n\" Well, you may mean that she is awayfrom her house, that is true. Now\ndescribe the house in which we live gene1'811y.\"\nYea. Wait a minute. I will go into the door at the side. What is that\ntall, old-fashioned thing in the back room 1 Ah, it is a big clock.\n24. Correct.\n\"Now go into the kitchen.\"\nYes. No one here now (10 p.m. in New Hampshire. 3 a.m. in England).\nA fat person, a cook has been here. Big man, with a dark moustache, has\nalso been here a good while during the day, and has left his inftuence here.\n\" Who is he 1\"\nHe has been put here to watch the place.\n\" Is he trustworthy and faithful 1\"\nYes, he is trustworthy.\n25. Interesting error. It was arranged on my leaving England that, in\ncase the servant should object to being left in the house alone\nduring the absence of my wife in Germany, a policeman should\nbe hired to guard the house and to live in it. At the time of the\nsitting I had not heard how this had turned out, and was quite\nready to suppose that a man was watching in the house. In\npoint of fact, however, there was nobody in the house excepting\nthe servant and a young girl, of which latter, as I knew nothing,\nthe clairvoyant natu1'811y made no mention. Note the imaginary\ndetails, \"big man,\" \"dark moustache,\" \"trustworthy\"; and com-\npare these with similar imaginary details in cases of hypnotic\nsuggestion, #J.fI\u2022\u2022 Forel, HlIF'wtismUII, p.45, &C.\nYou have lost your knife! Your mother tells me that.\n26. A sufficiently trivial communication from a lllother to her only child.\n\" Where is it 1\"\nOh, it is gone; you never will see it again.\n?:\/. This 1088 had vexed me, as the knife had been made to order. I\nhad lost it shortly before leaving England. The prophecy proved\nto be signally wrong, as the knife was restored to me soon after my\nreturn.\n\"Describe the other room on the ground ftoor now.\"\nYes. I see a long piano. What is that high thing that comes forward\non top of the piano 1 Ab, I see ; it is the lid.\n28. Clock and piano are respectively chief features of the two rooms.\n\" What colour is the wall paper of this room 1\"\nLet me see. It is yellowish, with gold pattern and gold spots.\n29. Correct.\nIn short, many things that I knew, even some things that I had forgot.ten,\nthe clairvoyant could tell me correctly, albeit somewhat confusedly. She\nmade all the mistakes that I should have made at the time, and her pro-\nphecies were quite as erroneous 8S allY that I might have invented myself.\n2 J(\nDigitized by Google\n\f574 .A Rec01\u00b7d oj Observatim18 oj\nOne sees the contents of one's mind as in a warped and flawy mirror.\nOr, to take the case from the other side, the secondary consciousness of t.he\nmedium seems able to get occasional glimpses at the panorama of one's\nmemory as through the rents in a veil. No doubt Phinuit gives the fullellt\nand best results when left unquestionQ(l, to tell what he can.

The tirst which we\ntake is closely connected with the last given. It took place at )!r.\nClarke's house, and it was of course impossible to conceal from Mrs.\nPiper the identity of Mrs. Clarke. No theory of chance will suffice\nto account for the curious list of definite facts about Mrs. Clarke's\nfamily which were correctly stILted by Phinuit; the possibility of their\nacquisition by extemalmeans has already been considered.\n52. (Sitting on December 29th, 1889, at 3, College-road, Harrow. Pre-\nsent: J. T. Clarke and W. Leaf j afterwards Mrs. Clarke.)\nSitting began at 3.50 p.m. j trance came on at 4.3.\nFour envelopes had been provided, marked A, B, C, D. A containQ(1\nthe statement, .. Charles I. was beheaded in 1649.\" B contained the linell,\n\u2022\u2022 'Veep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more, for Lycidas your sorrow\nis not dead.\" C contained a rough diagram of a six-pointed star. D\ncontained a reader's slip from,the British Museum, bearing the name of a\nbook. The contents of A were known to W. L. alone; of Band C to both\nW. L. and J. T. C. j of D to no one, the slip having been drawn at random\nby Mrs. Clarke from 2;000 similar slips, and enclosed in the envelope\nwithout having been looked at.\nDr. P. began, to Clarke: I know YOIl j you are the fellow that has got\nthe little girl Rebeeca, that is going to grow up such a fine woman.\n*1. Repetition of words used in previous sitting at Chocorua, New\nHampshire, September 20th, 1889.\nWhere is Hodgson 1\n*2. During my former sitting Mr. Hodgson was pres~nt in the room and\nshared the conversation with me.-J. T. C.\nYou are the fellow that has got the hole in the ground with the black\nDigitized by Google\n\fCerlain Phenom,enct of Trance. 575\nthings in it. (\"Coals1\") Of course, do you think I am a fool 1 There is\nsomething to come from that hole yet,- because I see light beyond it.\n*3. In the former sitting mention had been made of a town lot and\nbuildings as \"interest in the ground.\" The vagueness of this\nreference is here developed, by a question intended to be\nmisleading, into definite error. See Note 7 of preceding account.-\nJ. T. C.\nYour mother sends her love to you ; she stays with you.\nJ. T. C. : \"What was her middle name 1\"\nI will ask and find out for you.\n(The envelope marked C is now given to her.) \"Tell me what is in there.\"\n(She asks for the other one that is with it. B is then handed to her. She\nrubs both on her hair.)\n*4. The knowledge of the fact that a second envelope existed was\napparently derived from my consciousness, as but one envelope had\nbeen produced.--J. T. C.\nDo you know, I have been in these surroulldings before.\n*5. See description of this house in former sitting.\n. There was a lady passed out of the body here once.\nif 6. My mother.\nWhat is the matter with you 1 (To J. T. C.)\nJ. T. C.: \"I am grieved about the lady that passed out of the body.\"\nShe is all right; she is with you. You are the fellow that has got a\nDlother-in-law. .. (Correctly describes character as estimated by\nJ. T. C.) That's a letter, that one. (Shows B.) It makes me feel funny,\nthat one. It is something written-a letter. You know what I mean.\nWhat's this? (Shows B again.) There's an illness round this one.\n\" Is it a long letter 1\"\nNo, that's not a long one; it's what you call an illness round that one.\n(Various repetitions of the same idea follow.)\n*7. The secondary consciousness gradually became more and more\nconfused by these four sealed envelopes. 'J'he mediunl had\npreviously picked out the envelope B three times from among the\nrest, and afterwards referred to D as \"that book that you have in\nyourhand.\"-J. T. C.\n(lUrs. Clarke ente~d the room at this point.)\nJ. T. C. : \"Now tell me what. this is.\" (A given.)\nThere is French writing in that; somebody French wrote it. He wants\nto know the name of the spirit that wrote to him first. It is written by\nfIOmebody named Charles, and somebody named Fred has handled it.\nif 8. It is possible that the name Charles may have been a reading of the\nfirst name in the written sentence; but it is evidently connected\nwith my first acquaintance with the medium in the company of Dr.\nCharles Richet and Mr. Frederic Myers. M. Richet had asked a\nsimilar question in one of his sittings; soe p. 620.-W. L.\n(D is shown.) \"What is in that 1\"\nThat's only a note; it does not amount to anything.

She was introduced to Mrs. Piper and taken upstairs to sit in a\nfew minutes. It is therefore in the highest degree improbable that\nMrs. Piper could have had any opportunity of learning anything about\nher beforehand. She was of course introduced under another name\nthan her own. The following notes were taken by Mr. Myers.\nI see a sister, . . . in the body. She has not been well; has\n(lhanged her surroundings.\n[The name given was an approach to the right name of one sister, which\nwas afterwards given correctly.

PYE OS THE SITrL\"W OF JANUARY 1ST, 1890.\n(A) The number of my mother's family-my own brothers and sisters,\nwas at Ltst correctly given. The very little verbal help given by me iI;\nmentioned in the notes. My mother's family cousistod of seven sons 1'11(1\nthree daughters, of whom two sons and a daughter are dead. My father Im.'i\n\" second family of a son and two daughters who, with their mother, are alive.\n'''hen the llUJllber \"five\" was first mentioned I felt at the moment 1\\\nlittle puzzled, nut knowing whether both dead and alive were meant, or only\nthe latter. From that tinle I mentally separated them into three groupR, my\nliving brothel\"!l amI sistel\"R, those who are dend, n.nd my half sisters alUi\nbroth\"'l\".\n(8) Names now being mentioned, I will give for comparison those of lily\nIJarents and their children.\nDigitized by Google\n\fGOO A Record of Ob.'Jel'tmtions of\nFather-Kellow John. Mother-Mary.\nTheir children--Daughte1'8 :-\nMary Chesney, called Minnie_live.\nEdith May-dead.\nAlice Sybil, sometimes called Aggy- alive.\nSons :-\nEdmund, sometimes called Numbs-dead.\nKellow Charles-dead.\nRandall Howell-alive.\nWilliam Arthur (myself), usually\" Will.\"\nWalter.\nHarry.\nCharles, generally Charlie (see Note H).\nMy father's second family:-\nCatharine.\nWinifred, called Winnie.\nJohn Hayward.\nIt will be seen that my own name was the only one gh-en with absolute\nilX8ctne88 at this time, my brother Harry having been 80 baptised. I did\nnot at first connect the name I heard as Marie with lily sister Mary, partly\nbecause she is 80 generally called Minnie that her real name seldom occurs\nto me, but still more, I think, in consequence of the word being immediately\nnfterwards spelt M-A-R-I-A, which caused me at once to connect it\nwith an aunt Maria, with whom I have had a good deal to do.\nMy eldest brother is as frequently called \"Numbs\" as \"Edmund\"\namongst us, but never to my knowledge \"Ed \" or any such abbreviation.\nThe mention of a brother with a curious name made me at once think of\nmy brother Kellow, but neither now nor later on did I get any closer indica-\ntion of him.\nBy this time the imprel!l!ion was strung on my mind thllt the medium\nwa3 able in some way to correct her impreSliions ur suggestiuns by meana of\nmy conscious thuught. Thus I thought definitely of a number, my six li\\-IDg\nhrothe1'8 and siste1'8, or the four brothers, or the three of my father's second\nfamily, and these numbe1'8 seemed shortly to be given. 011 the spelling of\nthe word Maria, given as Il sister, I thought of my aunt Maria, and a little\nlater on she WaH 80 described. There were many other instances during the\nsitting.\nC. The only names alike in our family are those of my father and brother\nKellow, and mother and eldest sister. It is of course usual to find children\nllamed after their parents, especially when there are so many of them.\nI cannot trace this deafneSli or complaint of the ear to allY brother or\nflister. My eldest sister's husband is de:,f in the left ear to such a degree\nthat in walking or speaking with him it is necessary to take care to be on\nthe other side. This peculiarity would, I believe, at once occur to me were I\nto think of him.\nThe little girl referred to I cannot trace. I have since remembered that\nmy eldest sister many years ago lost an infant daughter, but this did not\noccur to me at the time. None connected with me have died at the age of\n14 or 15 that I can recall. My sister Edith died when 21 yeal'8 old.\nDigitized by Google\n\fOertain Phenomena of Trance. 601\nAt that date (January 1st) two brothers were away as mentioned.\nWalter in Scotland, amI the youngest, Charlie, was correctly described M\nbeing along distance away, as he has been for some years in China j othcr\u00b7\nwise the description of him does not specially apply.\nI do not remember the mention of Walter's or any name here, but tho.\nshorthand notes are probably right. He is not specially connected with mo\nnow, but is next to me in age, and for some time we lived together, and have\nalways becn great companions.\nD. This mention of Alick, Alec, or Alex is rather peculiar. Mr. I.e.\"f\nthinks that it was a reference to a previous sitting, and the \"Walter\" I was.\ninstructed to ask might apply to him. (Both the father and brother of Ml'R.\nH. Leaf were called\" Aleck.\"-W. L.) At first I did not remember anyone\nof the name except slight acquaintances, but after a few minutes recollected\none, now dead, who was closely connected with my wife. In the next section it.\nwill be seen that, with this in mind, I asked for further particulars and wa.~\nBOOn after referred to her for them. In ~ case, also, there were two of the\nname, father and son.\nOr, again. the reference might be taken as applying to an \"Alec\" of\nwhom my wife and I had heard a few days previously as being engaged to be\nmarried to another friend of hers, and more especially of her brothers and\nsisters who Ih'e in Stirling, where my brother Walter was at the time. In\nthis case the \"Walter\" to be asked might be taken to mean him; and he\nhas since told me, 011 my reading the notes over to him, that he at once took\nthe reference to apply to this engagement, of which he had naturally heard a.\ngreat deal.\nMy wifo has three sisters, not two, and all living j one, married to my\nbrother Walter, lives in London, but some distance from us j the other\ntwo are living with their parents in Scotland. The liking to have their own\nway may be taken as strictly correct of my sisters\u00b7in\u00b7law,-as of other\nladies.\nE. I lllwe seven children and regret that I here interrupted the medium\nto put the question about \"Alick,\" to which I have referred in the last\nsection.\nI was expecting the names \"Anna\" or \"Annie,\" the former being tllRt.\nof my wife'li sillter (afterwards given as a sister, see Note H) and the latter\na sister of a very dear friend of ours who died of canccr about two yeal'll\nago, and who might perhaps be taken as referred to as the elder sister, \"what\nyou call the short one,\" later on. As stated in the notes, I did not\nclearly hear whether the name first said Wl\\.'! \"Allie\" or \"Annie,\" but it.\nseems to have been the former. My sister, \"Alicc\" (as mentioned before), is\nsometimes called\" Aggy,\" never \" Allie,\" so far 1\\8 I amaWI\\l'Cj but \"Allie\"\nand \"Annie\" are, of course, very similar to \"Alice\" and \"Anna,\" who\nwould have heen correctly described if 80 given.\nMy wife has no relation of the name of Henry.\nNone of Illy brothers, 80 far as I know, have been seriously hurt in the leg\nor wrist, or have had a fall 011 the ice to be remembered. DYllpepsia lIli~ht\nho taken 811 applying to two or three, and Edmund, the one mentioned, diutl\nof a kindred compmil1t.\nI ought, perhaps, to mention that, on inquiry, there is an indistinct\nDigitized by Google\n\f002 A Record of Observati(nU1 of\nllistory of lIlJury to Harry'll wrist; but he does 110t himse1i recollect auy\nparticulars.\nF. Here, again, I did not notice the mention of my brothel' Walter's name,\nbut I immediately recognised the description as applying to him. Hi.\"\ncODllulting-room has bookshelves round two sides of it, and he habitually sits\nat a table covered with pl\\pers, the quantity of which llll!! IItruck me.\nRecently 1\\ book on Surgery, which he ill publishing, and the fact of lun'ing to\nconsult some public libraries with reference to some surgical lectures, 1Ulve\nheen discu88ed between us and connected with him in my mind.\nBoth Harry and I wear glasses when reading.\nI cannot think of any connection called Richard or Dick, and uuderstood\nthe \"Walter\" here to refer to Mr. Leaf. (The name .. Dick\" was urgL>d\nupon my brother and me in our joint sitting, hut not recoguised.-W. L.)\nAbout a week previously we had heard from my eldest sister tl1l\\t she\nhad been ailing, and had been to Torquay for change. She did not refer to\nher indisposition as serious, and mentioned that she was lJluch better; hut\nthe news was the subject of conversation between my wife and lllyse1i, 8.<; we\n)lI\\d not heard of her being unwell.\nMy mother is dead, as 1I1ready mentioned. If this were intended to a.pply\nto my step-mother or mother-in-law, I\\.'i might, perhaps, be inferred froUl the\nremark made a little later-{&Cti()\/~ G, \"Oh, that is not your lllother, not\nyour own mother \")-the description would he partly correct 1\\8 hoth ha\\'e\nrecently suffered from severe colds, though not, I believe, more than usllAlly\naffecting the chest or throat. It occurred to,me at the time as applyiug tn\nmy step-mother. (Judging from the context and Phinuit's frequent habit\nof ignoring questions, it seems to me to refer to the sistel\u00b7. In any case it is\na matter of no evidentisl importlmce.-W. L.)\nMy youngest child is under two years old, but the stat-emellt here n1l\\,1e\nwould have been equally true at any time within the last 13 yoors.\nI Illoved to my present house about five years ago, and nearly two yeal'll\nprevious to that date did make some rat11er important changes in my business.\nG. I have never resided with any elderly lady, as I undcrKtood this first\nl'emark to imply; but the whole of this section is very interesting to me, for\nreasons which, to explain, I must state at some length.\nWithin the last two years, or a little more, we have lost by some form of\nnmlignant growth (I have since the sitting heard a doubt as to whether in\none case it was ever defined as cancer) two to whom Illy wife and I were\nmuch attached; one the friend referred ,to in Note E, who died, aged\n37, and the other an aunt of my wife's, who was in her 60th year.\nI WI\\8 sitting with the latter a few months before her death and we were\ntalking of our religious beliefs, our descriptioDII of which di1I'ered. I WAS\nsaying that in matters where I was not as definitely com'inced as of the facts\nthat I was sitting where I WI\\8, or that two and two made fOllr, I preferred to\nsay only that I did not know, and that this referred for me to the question\nof a life after death. Her exact reply I forget, but I then, or very soon\nnfterwards, said, in reference to some allusion by ller of her death being\nprobably not far off, and of her differing from me, \"Well, if so, and if you can\nsend me any message, let me know.\" I am not sure of the exact woms, but\nI think that these are correct.\nDigitized by Google\n\fCerhtin Phenomena of Tt\u00b7(tnce. 603\nI had no sooner spoken than the thought occulTed to me that I hMl said\nsomething which I should very likely forget, but that it was not improbable\nthat the fact of my having made the request would bring about its apparent\nfulfilment through some unconscious cerebration, and I remember regret-\nting the words. To the best of my recollection I had not, up to the\ntime that the word cancer was first used, thought of this lady at all during\nthe sitting, although of the other one, whom I have mentioned, I certsinly\nhad, and \\vas hoping for some mention of her.\nMy wife's aunt lived with her mother, a very old lady of nearly 90,\nfrom whom we had heurd that morning; and there was in the letter 1\\\nmention of our 1088.\nH. From this point the notes do not appear to me to call for much\nremark. The mention of Anna and Charlie (see Sectimll! E aml C) is to be\nnoticed, and there is a rather curious difference between my idea of what\nwas said ill the phrase, \"The friend that pBIIBed out with consumption,\" &c.,\nand Mr. Leaf's notes, which I am satisfied are eOlTect. The word which I\nwas confident I had heard was \"sister\" and not \"friend,\" and my sister\nEdith did die of consumption. We were very deeply attached to each other\nand I had been looking for a mention of her name.\nI have no sister who can be called ill. The remarks about myself are\nII:lrhaps cOlTect, and that my wife plays the piano is certsinly true.\nIf I may make a few general remarks on my impressions of the sitting as\na whole, I should say that I put aside as utterly out of the question !lny idea\nof collusion,.or conscious deception by the medium of herself or any other\nperson. It seems to me to be equally inconceivable that the COlTectness of\nthe statements can be explained by coincidence only; but if, in a state of\nIIllspended volition, sensory powers can be raised to the point of being able\nto read some of the minor thoughts of another person, I think that all the\nincidents of tlris sitting are easily accounted for. I have already alluded to\nthe strong impreSBion I gathered that ideas of nnmber, or names, or such like,\nthat I fonllulated during the time, were in some way conveyed to the medium\nand stated later by her ; although some of the most striking references made\nwere not, so far as I could judge, in my conscious thought at all.\nI am, of course, quite alive to the fact that it would be absurd to generalise\nfrom a single instance like this, and I understand that other sittings have left\nvery different impressions. I feel, therefore, that there may p088ibly be 1\\\nbetter explanation than the one which suggests itself, of the communication of\nsome stratum or strata of thought (so to speak), to a perception out of the\npower of all but a few, which is only active when:combined with an abnormal\nstate of the brain. W. A. P.\nWe now proceed to the notes taken of some thoroughly unsatis-\nfactory sittings, in order to give 0. fair ideo. of the methods by which\nguessing was carried on in co.ses where there seems to haye been a.\ncomplete absence of any supernormal means of information.\n19.

T. BarkwQrth. Ducm.beI'3,\u00b7d.\nMr. Bal'kwol\"th gives the following report:-\n\"In commencing the s&mce I held the medium's hands, which were icy\ncold and did not !leem t~) gather warmth.

The medium Reellled to find my\ninfluence uncongenilll; sho eomplained more than once that I had done\nsomething to her, that her heall was bad, that she felt 'lueer, had never felt\nso before, &c. She continually groaned as if in suffering. After long wait-\ning Mr. Myers took my place with much better results. She went through\na kind of struggle or crisi!l, confined to tho upper part of the body, and\nimmediatoly olllorgod in the charactol' of 'Dr. Phinuit,' with a mannish\n\"oice, a more marked Amoricnn or Gonllan-American accent than she usually\nhas, and confliderable freodom of language. We then entered into a convor-\nsation, of which Mr. Myel'll took notes, but my impre88ion is very strong that\nno notes t.\"ken in longhand could be sufficient. The cnnvcl'K.\"ltion was very\ninterjectional, Bml intol'spel'setl with queries Bntl cjaculations to which it was\ndifficult to avoid giving compromising allSwel'll. Thull,' The name begins\nwith F, doesn't it now?' 'Yes.' 'Didu't I tell you sol' Having got\nso far, the question was practically narrowC(i to Francis or It'rederick, and I\nasked her which it was. After repeating the names two or three times back-\nwards and forward!! she ultimately decided on Frederick, which was correct.\nAbout the age at which Fredorick left the worM there was a regular fencing\nmatch, of which I think it highly probablo I got the worst. 'Wall he an\nold man, a young man, 01' a child l' I Bsked. At a comparatively early\nstage of the inquiry I got it that lIe was not au old mBn. but beyond this I\ncould not get. She kept on going aU round the que!!tion in a way which\nwould have dri\"en a cro88-examining barrister frantic, but the only definite\nfltatement I got was that Frederick had a vory bad memory; which, as\nFrederick was only three weeks old when he died, did not seem very\nnpproprinte. I tried to stick to the form of question, 'A young man or a\nchild 1' But it is impossible in the game of question and allswer which was\ncarritld on to be sure that I did not give some indicat.ion of the answer. At\n1:mgth she decided that he was only 'That high,' i.e., ahout 2ft. And hore I\nwould relnark that my light hand was holding her left hand all the time.\nDigitized by Google\n\fCertain Phenomena, of Trance. 607\nN uthing would be easier on the Cumberland and Bishop principle than for a\nt\\uught-reader to detect by the unconscious pressure of the hand when he\nWI\\'<, as children say, 'hot' or 'cold.' It is noticeable that whenever a\ncluestion which admitted of no yerhlll strategy was put, such 1\\.'1, 'Wbat is\nIlly nllme l' or '\\Vhere is my wife I' Mrs. Piper at once confessed she\n~,,)uld not tell. On the other hand, when it came to the names of my family,\nwhich happens to he a large one, her task was obviously much easier. J olm,\n'Villiam, Henry, and Thomas are not very uncommon names, and it is not\nsurprising that she should have hit upon them correctly. It is possible to\nhave many brothers, hut only one father; and accordingly, while she\n1;ucceeded in fitting the former with one or other of the above nllmes, she\n<Iuite failed with the latter, to whom she attributed my own name, and with\ncflual incorrectness some of my own peculiarities, as though relying on a\nfamily likeness. III the CIIse of another brother whom I asked for she said\nllis name was Ed, which would, of course, do equally well for Edward,\nEdmund, Edgar, or Edwin. Still I do not wish to minimise the fact that\nwithin these limits Rhe waR right, or that she ultimately fixed upon Edmund,\nwhich was right t{)(). .\n\"In describing placeR she was e,\u00b7en less successful.

But when she came to describe the\nrOOlll she hecame so invulved that I could not follow her.

It happens, hOlVe,\u00b7er, that\nmy house has one peculiar feature no one would he likely to gueRR, viz., two\n1-;'l'lI\\re halls one behind the other. When asked accordingly what was the\napartment straight in front beyond the entry, she made attempts t{) describe\na sitting-room furnished, and failed entirely t{) say what it was t.hat ran all\nalong one side-in fact, the Htaircase. She was correct in only one point, viz.,\nn 'cllse in a recess' ; there being in fact an old packing case under the Ktairs,\nhut whether this was the kind of CIIse and recess she meant the reader must\n(lccide for himself. The only other point I remember was that !lhe told me\n(lne of my internal organs was out of order, in which I take the liberty of\ndiffering from her; whereas she failed to indicate an accidental injury to the\nfoot. which had existed for some time.\n\" Once Rhe used the expreRSion 'what the devil,; and it certainly seemed\nto me that there was a momentary hesitation in bringing it out, such as\nlvould he more natural to a person of gentle manners, which Mrs. Piper in\nher normal \"tate cerffiinly has, than to the boisterous and rough-spoken\nDr. Phinuit.\n\"In describing my house I at one point sought to lead her to another\nJlllrt than the one she was engaged on; when she replied, 'Wait a bit; I am\nnot out of the first room yet,' or, 'Wait till I get out of the front room'-\nwords whieh clearly indicated that her' familiar' was present in spirit in my\nhouse, near London, while he wa!! claiming to speak through her lips at\nCambridge.

This is not quite adequately represented in the\npa.rts of the com\"erMtion that I have recorded, because I cannot remember\nthe words sufficiently, but I had the impression that the medium had frI()j\"e\n.lefinite \u00ablid m(we accurate notions of the characters than I have been able to\nreproduce in what I call remember of her words. A. J.\nDigitized by Google\n\fCC'riain Phe1UYinena of Trfl?lCe. 613\nThili sitting is carefully reported, and is one of the more successful.\nIt is, however, to some extent, open to the suspicion of systematic\nguessing. I therefore propound the following hypothesis as to the\nprocess which Phinuit may have employed; though I cannot help\nfeeling that the assumptions made are in many cases rather violent. I\nmust, however, say that the suggestion of a supposed connexion with\n.Mrs. A. and Mrs. B. is not so gratuitous as it might seem; it is based\nupon the use of a name which had to be changed in their reports.\nThe first guess is at the number of the family; an average number,\nfour, is taken, with \"one besides\" thrown in in case foul' be too few.\nIf, on the other hand, the number be too large, the one besides will be\nexplained as referring to a \"relative in the spirit.\" But the sitter\nJ,rives some indication that there are more than four; the next guess is\nright.\nFour sisters possibly suggests that the sitter may be some con-\nnexion of Mrs. A. and Mrs. B. who have sat recently. These ladies\nhad been said to have two brothers, rightly; but it had not appeared\nthat they had no more. Hence\" two brothers are near you always,\"\nbut the eldest brother \"looks 0. long way off,\" because he had not yet\nbeen introduced upon the stage, if he existed. The theory is, however,\nsoon found to be wrong, and is given up. The allusion to the sister\nElise or Eliza, \"I saw her 0. little while ago, but she did not see me,\"\nalso contains obvious possibilities of herlging; for it might be explained\nwhether the sister had already sat or not. If she hnd sat, the explana-\ntion would of course be, \"I was in the spirit.\"\n\\Ye then come to the favourite fishing name \"Etl:' This is not\nrecognised in any of its forms, nnd is therefore chnngerl to Ida, a name\nwhich, as Phinuit had found, was familiar to sevel\".11 of his sitters.. In\nthis case, however, it is unsuccessful. Then another fishing name, Loo.\nThis is pllrtilllly acknowledged. Two very common names, John and\nJnmes, are tried in vain, but probably with enough indication on the\nsitter's part to encourage Phinuit to effect a bold tmnsition to George;\nright at last.\nThe knee as usual is selected as a site for It complaint for reasons\ngiven previously. It is evident that here indications given by the\nsitter may ha\\'e led to the correct location of the In'other's suffering in\nthe foot.\nTeaching as the situ-r's occupation is only guessed correctly nfu-r\nthree failures; it is a likely one at Cambridge. The name is got at\nlike othel'S from a vague bebrinning. \"Aliza\" would lead equally, with\nthe latitude which Phinuit nllows himself, to Elizabeth or Louisa.\n\" \\Yilliam\" is correct, but it is the commonest man's name, and could\np\"obably, if desired, be altered to Walter, or made into one of the\ncommon surnames, \\Yilliams, Wilson, &c. \"You know Annie or\nDigitized by Google\n\f6140 A R~col'd 0\/ Obs~)\u00b7t'(lt ions of\nFannie\" is agl,in \"brue~ which would probably sU('ct>ed with a largo\nmajority of peuple.\n\"Had you an aunt who died of cancer\" is a. fishing question such\nas wa.-; asked of many sitters.

TlIPII\ncomes the feeling of cheek and jaw; \"there is a sort of numbness here;\nwhat i;; it ?\" The following description slowly wOl\u00b7ked out wa.'i possihly\nguide(l by unconscious hints.\nPassing on'I' the ubvious conclusion dmwn from the spectacles and\nthe likt'ly gut's..; that out of four sistel\"l; one is at lea.\"t oonsic1el't'd\nmusil'al by hl'l' fnmily, and that another one paint..., we come to\n\"Nellie OJ' Ellt'II.\" This might, of course, be Helen or Eleanor; but,\nin dt'fault of these it is made to do duty fUI' Nettie or Kett.ie (Kaw,\nCathel\u00b7ine).

Dr. Phinuit rather took to this fOlm of\n1'xperiment and insisted on trying it sometimes when the sitters might\nhave preferred something else. His success, however, was not \\,('\u00a3y\nstartling though probably beyond what chance would produce. It\nseemed, too, to confirm the view that his success in other things WIIS\nsupentormal; since, so far as the small number of trials enables us to\njudge, he succeeded in this with sitters whom he succeeded well with\n.,therwise.

There is little under this head to add w what Mr. Leaf\nhas said in his summary of the I'epol-ts of the seances. Dr. Phinuit\nclearly connected us together as husband and wife and later gave OUI'\nname, though, as we believe, no clue as to our identity had been given,\nand we had been introduced at :Mr. Myers' house separately and\nanonymously, and had not been seen together. He also, as will be seen\nfrom the abstracts of seances, made a few strikingly correct statements\nabout us and persons connected with us, but these were so much mixed\nup with what was false or vague that it is impossible to attach much\nevidential value to them. His degree of success was very decidedly\ngreater with Mr. Gale and Mr. Konstamm, especially the former, amI\nwe al'e disposed to attach some illlportance to these sittings.\nIn conclusion we may say that, while our own experience taken by\nitself would not establish Dr. Phinuit's claim to supernormally acquirefl\nknowledge, it seems to us to support to some extent that claim,\nwhich fl'om the reports of othel'S we belie\\'e to be justified.\nP.S.--By MRS. SIDGWICK.\nOn my own account I should like to add one 01' two remarks to OUi'\njoint report printed above. I was present either as sitter or as\nrepol\u00b7t.er-sometimes both-at all, except one, of the sittings at OUi'\nown house, and had, therefore, some opportunity of observing the\ndifference between Phinuit's manner at good sittings and at bad one-:,\nI should charactet'ise all those in which I was myself the sitter as bad;\ncomparatively little knowledge of my affairs was shown, and Phinuit's\nmanner was correspondingly hesitating and uncertain, and his com-\nmunications full of vague guesses and \"fishing.\" The effect both on\nI On(' of these was dt.ubtful and the others not sufficiently specified in our notes,\nbut 1 helieve all were right.\n2 One of thcic was 0.1110 fingel's : 80 the number being right there was no further\ndoubt.\nDigitized by Coogle\n\fG18 .A Record of ObHe1'!:ationR of\nllillu;!'lf !lnd on me WIlS wearying a.nd ,I!'pressing, II.n(1 it is, I think.\n'Iuite likely that this depression I'encted again on hi>! \"lucidity,\" and\nI'PlHlered success hopeless. At a good sitting this guessing and\" fish.\ning\" seeme!1 at times quite absent. The sitting which impres..~ me\nmost strongly in this way was No. 64, that of :Mr. H. Gale (of which Mr.\nuuf has given an abridged account, p. 642), \/11111 this although one or\ntwo of the things said to :Mr. Konstamm were pel'haps more striking.\n}Ir. Gille's sitting, like many othel'S, became vl1\/,-rue 1\\\\1(1 more incoherent\ntowards the end, but during all the earlier pllrt of it Phinuit gave the\nimpression of really knowing what he was talking about. He described\n::\\h. Gale's father and mother 8.'! if he had them before him; in a bad\nlight, perhaps, or rather far off, so that he could not make them out\nwith ahsolute distinctnes.'!, but still as if he wel'e trying to describe\nwh!\\t he saw, not at all IlS if he wel'e guessing. I was ahsolutely\nignol'll.nt of the facts myself, and my impression is that it wal! as much\nPhinuit's manller as lIr. Gale's which made me feel at the time that a.\nt.rue account was being given.\nAnother point of some interest is the question of the importance of\nYel'hatim repOl\u00b7ts of the seances. It has often heen said that it is only\nhy 8hOl1,hal1(l report.'! that the weak points of the seances can be fully\nlll'OUght out. There is no doubt that full reports are valuable in this\nway, but I think that they would sometimes bring out strong points as\nwell as weak ones. I felt, while I Wl'Ote as fust as I could (without\nshorthand) for :Mr. Gale, that a vel'batim report would have brought\nout many details which I was forced to omit or could do but scant\njnstice to.\nOn the other hand, the evidential value of a shorthand report may\nc:\\sily he overrated. When so much may depend on manner, gestul'E'.,\namI tone of voice, bot.h in Phinuit allfi the sitter, the fullest shorthand\nreport cannot be complete.\nPROFESSOR C.

Here there could clearly have been no guidance\non Mrs. B.'s part, as she did not recognise the pel\"SOn spoken of till she\nwas told that it was her mother-in-law. The other statements made\ncould possibly be explained either by fishing or by a slight knowledge\nof local gossip. The question about Samh may evidently have been of\nthe former class; when it was once known that she was a parlour-maid.\nit was a fairly safe guess to say that she had recent-Iy let something\ndrop.\n7. Norember 26th. lVit\/,. Mi~ Alire Johnson. .'WI' p. 608.\n8. NoremlNr 26th. With Mrs. H. Sidgu\u00b7i.-k.\nMrs. Sidgwick was introduced anonymously. The notes were\nwritten out from her recollection immediately after the sitting, Mr.\nDigitized by Google\n\fCedain Phe1wmena of Trance. 623\nlIyers having been sent out of the room. The following were the\ncorrect statements made :-\nThat the Kitter had a father, mother, and brother in the spirit-world;\nthat the brother had come there since the mother; that Mrs. S. had two\nsisters both alive; that her IlUKband Rtlldied milch; that his father was in\nthe spirit-world; that Khe and her husballd were both anxious to learn the\ntruth; and that the dead brother had in hiK lifetime anxiously sought for fact~.\n\"Theile varioull Ktatements scattered through the sitting were, I think,\ntJle only true oneil made without fishing about at all.\n.. Dr. Phinuit allowed me no brothers at firKt except the one in the spiJit-\nworld, bllt ultimately added 'Arthur' (right), after trying to fit that name\n.m to the one in the other world. I told him before the end of the sitting\nthat I had three brothers alive. He said my husband's name was Henry with\nvery little previnuK heKitation, though at nne point he tentatively suggeste(l\nthat Henry was an Earl; and he praised him I' good deal. He settled that\nI had no children, hut only after trying to induce me to own to a very smart\nyoung man 1\\11 my HOll. Failing in this he identified the smart young lIIan\nas a perKon of the name of Smith and a pupil of my husband's. (Cannot be\nidentified.) He correctly gave 'Villiam as the name of Illy hw;band'Oi father,\n:\\Ild Charlell 1\\11 the name of a dead uncle, I\\nd Robert 1\\11 the llallle of a living\nuncle of mine, but thiK was only after trying whether theOie nameR would tin\nfor other relative!!. He gave a prediction about my uncle. (Not yet\nreali!!ed nor likely to be.) He said that my mother had died of geneml\nwel\\kneRll of Kevernl orgaIlll, ill particular the heart. Thill was fairly accumte,\nthough rather indefinite. I thought it pretty good. He gave my mother'K\neolouring wrong, however, fair brown hair tunled greyish, but fair brown\nllair is a good description of my own. He said that I had taken care of my\nbrother in hi!! ilInesli. Later on in the seance I asked what he had die(t\nof, or how he died, I forget which; he said correctly of an accident, of n\nfall, hurt his head. But he went on to Hpeak of care of him after the\na::cident, which waOl wrong. He said he wa>l cngaged in studying and had\nheen cut off in the midllt of work, which is true. He spoke of an Abhie, 01'\nAddie, AdehLide, and wa.'! pleased when I admitted that I had an aunt of that\nnallle. He Kllid that Rhe had left a child, which was true. (She died whcn\nthe child, now grown up, waR born. It was I, not Phinuit, who identifil.>tl\nAdelaide as an aunt.)\n\" But a great Ill\/my names were mentioned and even pressed which I can-\nnot conllect with anyone at all. He attempted to describe my house, but a.'i\nfar as I understood it was all wrong, except that a dark-haired young\nperson, llIl.!d ~) be very faithful, and engaged in brushing, might do for the\nparlour-maid. He was very anxious that I should recognise 0. woman whom\nhe named variously Alison, Ellison, Harrison, and who died of some affec-\ntion of the throat and bronchial tubes, and who was connected with 1\\ Louisa.\nI have a cousin named Louisa, but that does not give any clue. Neverthe-\nless he insi1lted on my remembering about thi>l perKOn and trying to recogniHe\nller. He also gave me as a test that my brother Arthur had been worrietl-\nhusiness troubles-a person named George unfaithful-but all would collie\nright.

Nur~fnbtl' 29th, M,'. Ol('(\/j' BI'\",rll;II,.\nThis was a short sitting, Mr. Browning following .,Mrs. B.\" The tranco\nelUled after a very few minutell. Mr, Browning gives the following report :\nTh\u00b7. Phinuit told mo that I was a good fellow, that I !lllloked too much, and\ndescribed a IImoking cap which I habitually wear. Ho said that there was n.\nspirit closely connocted with me named Mariana-my mother'lI name ; that\nlihe wore a cameo hrooch with a head upon it, which ill quite true, and that\nshe wanted to know where it was. He IIl'0ke alKO of two other spirits, William\nand Arthur, elder brother!! who are dead, the last two who died, and the only\ntwo I knew well. lIe alK(, said that my grandfather's name was Tholllas~\nwhich ill, I beliel'e, true of both my grandfathers, and that his wife's name\nWaR Sarah. I do not know \"'hether this is true or not. (Mr. Browning lIub-\u00b7\nHtl(lllently found th\"t it was lIot true of his grandmother, but that the wife of\nun IIncle, also a Thomas, WI\\!! named Sarah.) He also said that I was Ol'er-\nworked, and should not work 110 hard, which is probably true. lIe also said\nthat I had had a good deal of trouble, which is true. hut that it was now\ncomillg to an end. He also IIpuke about all uncle George, but not l'ery clearly_\nI IlSked him where my nephews \"re, the sons of Arthur. He said that one\nwas in Australia and one in Philadelphia, but I do not know whether this il'i\ntrue. (Mr. Browning hIlS lIubse'luelltly IIScertained that one was in fact ill\nPhiladelphia at the time ; he was known to be in America. The other was\nbelieved to he in India, but may have gone to Australia; tillS has not yet\nl)een ascertained). He al!1O IIpoke of my !lister, and described her in a way\nwhich is absolutely true. At the same time it is not the first thing which,\nwuultl have occurred to me tu say about her, but it probably would bal'e been\nthe first thing my mother would hal'e Mid.\nAlthough many of the matters lltateli by Phinuit were undoubtedly known.\nt\/l me, they were not all in my mind at the time. After the interview I had\nthe IItrong impreRllion that the conununications came from my mother, who\nhnd died about six months before, although Phinuit did not at all !IOek t<\u00bb\ncom'oy thill impression.\nIII thi!! sitting there SI.'eIllS to have been clear thought-t\\'ansferl.'nl..'e_\nTt would seem that hardly anything definitely \\\\Tong was said; ,mel\nMr. Browning say!! that he hnl-dly spoke at nIl, so that 110 assistance.'\nelm have been given by the sitter. The Illore interesting que,'>tioll'\nl'emnills as to whethel' thel'e is evidence of more than thought-\ntmnsfel'ence, This depends largE-lyon whethel' it is ultimately foullll\nout that Mr. Browning's nephew, supposed to be in Ill!lill, was really\nin Aust\\'alia.. The f,ld thnt (Ille was in Philadelphia, though this Wll.\"\u00b7\nuut known to the sittE.'I\u00b7, is of less weight. The name of thE.' town may\nhe 110 more than a bold gueSll, correct by chancf'; and is tn SOlllt~\nI'xtent discounted when we find that ill one of the Li\\'erpool sittings a\n)lCl'S01l was wrongly said to be ill Philadelphia, in 11 street which tUI'Il;\"\n1I1It to be nOll-existent. This tends to prove t,hnt Philadelphia is a\nIlllme used by Phinuit for purposes of fishing. 1<1oreo\"er,1<1r RruwnillJ.f\nLa...\" sillce informed me that some months ago his mother had received a.\nDigitized by Google\n\fO:'\/'iain PltenO'fnena of Trance. 627\nletter from the nephew in Philadelphia and read it to him, but without\ninforming him where it was written from.\n14. Novembel' 29tlt. PmjUMJr G. H. Durwin, IleCQlul sitting. The\nfollowing report is yil-en by the Bitter:-\nThe medium spoke of my sister, and corrected herself to sister-in-law,\ngiving the llAme right, and of my brother, with no llAme, who was very ill.\nThe illness, although wrongly specified, was more or less in the right region.\nA spirit llAmed D-A-R-\\V-I-N, spelt, not pronounced, sent a message.\nI was told that I had two children (right), both boys (wrong), and that they\nwere good-tempered (right). There was other \"ague infonllation about thelll\nnot worth recording. My father was dead (inforlllAtion derived from previous\nsitting), my mother lil-ing, which I believe was also known in the same way;\ncertain ailments of my mother were llAmed (wholly wrong). My wife was\nMid to have a pain in the left side which the medium localised exactly,\nand my wife was said to think that it was due to her heart, but the medium\nsaid it arose from the spleen. The day before my wife had complained of\nsome pain in the left side, but it was localised by the medium wrongly by six\ninches, and my wife knew it was not due to the heart or spleen; on this day\nshe had no pain. My wife was said to have had an absce&, (wrong). My\neldest boy (a girl) was said to sulfer from relaxed throat, but the seat of the\nailment was the glottis. She had been having a slight sore throat the day\nbefore, but I think it was nearly or quite well on thill day. She has\ncertainly some very Hlight tendency to stammer.\nAlmost every statement mnde could have been given if the mediulll could\nhave discoveredl11Y llAme and a few fragments of Cambridge talk between the\nfirst sitting and the second. The only things which appear to me even at\nall remarkable are the IItatementli about my wife and child, which will III\\\\'0\nbeen seen to contain much error. In the second sitting it WIll! agreed that I\nshould not correct the medium when wrong, and thill appears to me far\nIJrefcrable to the plan adopted in the first, when IIhe WI\\II corrected. I\nremain wholly unconvinced either of any remarkable powers 01' of thought-\ntransference.\n15. NOl'cmbu 2!l\/II. PmjclJSVr II\"'Il'!!

After this the talk WR8 chiefly addressed to Mr. W., who was\nrightly said to have a father, mother, three sisters, and two brothers. He\nWR8 also truly told that he had a grandfather named J01111, a relative name(l\nArthur, and that one of his brothers was a long way oft' across the water,\nand had been away a long time.

De~mbt!r 31st.\nOnly imperfect notes of this sitting were taken, though a shorthand\n'Hiter was present, as she and Mr. Walter Leaf were sent out of the\n)'oom by Dr. Phinuit fo), the greater part of the time. The following\nI\u00b7t'port by llr. Shattock, however, contains all the principal statement.~\nSt't out separately with comments :-\n.. You have two brothers, hoth in the IIpirit,\" sullllequently corrected by\nthe medium into\" one in the body and one in the spirit.\" I ha,\"e a brother\nin the body; one in the spirit is a wrong lltatement or guess. There is\nIlothing which can be COllstrued into it. This I know for certain.\n\" You h\",'e a friend named Arthur. He ill at present ill, and likely to\npRill! away.\" I have an acquaintance of the name, but I could not without\nHome delay lim} out if there is any truth in the last part of the statement.\nHe is a person of about middle age with wholl1 Illy aC(luaintance has long\nHince dropped.\n\"There is a child who hall passed out of the body with scarlet fever con-\nnected with you.\" Medium stated this to be the child of an aunt. The\nIltatelllent iH not correct, as I ha\"e no aunt on either side.\n\"Your father Thomas has got the rheulUatism.\" Here the mediulII\ngrasped my left knee. My father's name is not Thomas. He has muscular\nrheumatism of the ordinary kind now and then in ,\"arious parts of the body,\nhut no marked articular rheumatism.\n\"You have an uncle Henry.\" The medium started with the name, and\nit was I who, after lIome delay, volunteered the statement that I had an\nuncle of the name, iIi ol'(}er to open up the way for further statements.\nSo. when the medium lltated that my father's name was Thomas, I\nvolunteered the statement that I had an uncle of the name. After this the\nmedium said, \"I get your father's influence, and then I get Thoma.'I.\"\n\" You made a mistake in your life. It wa!! a long while ago. You made\na Kb,rt in life, and it did not prove to be very succellllful, and then you made\n~mother, am} the second did..,\nThis is not true.\n\"Then I get no Kisterll.\" This is true, but was not a direct statement\n..f the medium. It WIlS made after a conversation which led me to say I ha.d.\nno sisters.\n\" There are two little boys, and one of them is very fidgety and nervous.\nThat is the eMest ; he likes to have his own way. The other is quieter in\ndisposition, and easier to get on with. This gentleman's lady is not well.\nhilt she will be better, she will get out light.\" These s~tements I did not\nat aU lead up to. They were given without any delay on tile part of the\nmedium, and they are the truth, though not the whole truth, as there is a\nthird boy dead. But the statement as it Ktands is satisfactory.\nAfter variouK incorrect or un\\\"erifiable statements, \"You h:,\\\"e a lady\nfliend.

Shattock remarks ;-\nThe only statements of any note coming direct from the medium were\nthose concerning the two boys. Of the others, some are quite erroneous;\nother!! of such a genersl nature thnt no importance can be attached to them;\n:\\:1d others were so largely due to myself that they can hardly be called the\nmedium's.\nI take it for granted that the medium was not simulnting IInother state;\nthnt has, of course, been tested on previous occasions; though whether this\nwere so or not would not alter the facti! of the case. For there is no reason\nwhy, in a (luasi-hypnotic state, the subject should not act much liS in the\nwaking state; lind it iR of cour!!e well-known that in such a condition decep-\ntion mlly be had recollr!!e to. There ill nothing incredible, therefore, in\nhelieving that Mrs. Piper knows nothing of what occur!! in' the trance,\nthough while in the tr!!nce she may act in a very ordinary way, so far as any\nmanifestation of mental processeK goes.\nThought-rending or transference, I think, there cannot be in tho case ;\nfor \/\\II Mrs. Piper l\\lISerted that no concentration of thought was neceKAAry, I\ndid not attempt anything of the kind. Much of what she Mid WII.'! the lll.st I\nshould hnve thought of. Muticle.reading seems altogether 'out of the\n([uestion. So that I cannot but think that the statements mllde are only\nshrewd gue88e.'!, made on n carefully planned system. She seemed to me to\nfeel the way by throwing out a Htray name, or making a general statement.\n'fhere is, moreover, II wily shc hM of combining resultl! or expillining away\nmiRHtatements that is noteworthy.\n\\\\Then it is remembered that the sitting occupied some three-quarter!! of\nnn hour, and that the only really true statements of any note were tho.'!e I\nII\/we already mentioncd, there iH no need, it Heems to me, t<J a,\";sume any\nother power in the medium than that I have mentioned. Of course a lnrge\nserics of observations may point to a different conclusion.\n50. J!?\"altcr Leaf awl Haberl Leaf. Decembe,' 31..t.\nMr. H.

He is very haPl'y-go-lucky-musical-he can do everything,\nwhistle, sing, and dan~e. He is 110t far away. He hl\\8 lots of letters and\nfriends. Girls like him \"ery much. He is studying to be a lawyer 01'\ndoctor, or IIOmething of that IIOrt. He gets into different costumes and acts.\nDo they call him Jack 1 John? They call him Pete; they call him every-\nthing.\"\nNone of these names were right, though he is called by many names.\nNor is he studying for a profession. In other respects the state-\nments are accurate. This brother is the only one of Mr. Gale's\nfamily who is not far away, in America. The name of Will Adams\nWI\\S given I\\S that of a friend; but the brother hl\\8 only the slightest\nacquaintance with a man of that name.\nA correct description was given of Mr. Gale's mother. She was said to\nlook very young for her age. .. She and Willi.'\\m are more like one another\nthan the rest of the family. She is smaIl and rather dark.\" These and other\ntraits given are said by Mr. Gale to be strikingly con-ect.\nThe name Edward was then tried, and applied to brother, father, and\nuncle, all wrongly. ,\nWhen your mother went away it did her a great deal of good; she had a\ncold on her chest. She has been staying with an elderly gentleman.\nMr. Gale's mother took a trip for her health Il\\St spring. and retunll~d\ngreatly imprm\u00b7ed. But nothing is known of the elderly gentleman.\nYour grandfather on your mother's side WI\\S lame. (Asked\" All his\nlife 1\") No; but that one time. You don't remember that, but your mother\nwill tell you.\nMr. Gale finds that his matenll\\l gr&ndfnther was lame from 1\\ stroke of\nparalysis for some 10 months. He remembers nothing of this, as\nhe did not see his g1'1mdfather during this time.\nEdward; is he your uncle or your cousin? I don't like him, and I don't\nknow that anyone did. He don't seem to get on somehow.\nMr. Gale l'ecognises this 1\\8 a cousin.\nThe name of Alice WI\\S given, and finlllly said to belong to Edward's\nsister. This WI\\8 right; but she WI\\S wrongly said to be musical. Mter this\nthe statements made were lUOStly wrong. The flame of Williams was given :\n\" It WI\\8 your uncle, I think; a relative connected hy marriage. I think 011\nthe mother's side.\"\nMr. Gale remarks: .. I have a second cousin on my mother's side nallled\nMrs. ,\\ViIliams, whom we Illways call aW1t, however. She hl\\S been\na widow many years, and I never &'\\w her husband.\"\n65. Ml\u00b7S. H.

Mrs. S. was said to have two Franks connected with her\nand a GelT)' (pronounced, not spelt) who was much with Frank. This 11'&8\nso far true; but G. was said not to be in the body, and probably there 11'&8\nconfusion with Profe8lOr Lodge's uncles Jerry and Frank. A large number\nof names were given which were wrong.\n00. Mr,. B. Third sitting.

A girl with her, her daughter; not the one with\nthe knees, llamed Helen. Helen's hair looks better than it did before.n (See\np. 586.) Vague allusions were made to the illness of Mrs. B.'s brother and\nher sister-in-law. Mrs. Verrall's letter shown was rightly said to have the\nin1luence of her sister and her husband.\n67.

A\" rather appropriate ..\ndescription of his character was given. \" He is fairer than you and has more\ncolour.\" An attempted description of the actions of Miss Johnson's sister\nwas wrong. Miss J.'s watch\u00b7chain was felt. \"That is your in1Iuence, you\nbought it yourself\" (right).

January 23lvl.\nThe names of Profe8lOr Sidgwick's uncles were at last gh-en correctly,\nas William, Henry and John on the mother's side. and John, Robert and\nJames on the father's. But one, Christopher. was omitted. Finger-guessing\nwas not successful, and a description given of what Mrs. Verrall WI\\I doing\nat the time was completely wrong.\n69. Mr. Ed1fJill Max Kmi-lltamlll. (See p. 615.) First sitting. JalllKllll24th.\nAfter some vague and wrong statementa the sitter was told rightly that\nthere were five in his family, not counting father and mother. That he had\na sister Fannie-Anoie-whose head was hurt; that she had a pain in the\ntop of her head and confusion, coming from a fall while riding. This is true\nof a Bister named Angela_ One of hiB parenta, afterwards specified as his\nmother, was said to have a pain in the foot. TIlls was afterwards localised\nin the toe, after feeling the sitter's foot all over. .. There is a fulneBI\nthere ; something is gone there.\" The latter statement is true. His father\nwas truly said to have had a positive mind. \"Your younger sister has fair\nhair; she is lively. She is studying; she stands back and puta her hands up\n(making a gesture). Elocution-you call it acting.\" This is true; as Mr.\nK. 's youngest sister is an actress and Mr. K. thought that the \"standing\nback,\" &c., applied well t~ his sister's manner in acting. Some rather vague\nremarks about a picture of her were taken by the sitter to allude to the fact\nthat she had recently been photographed in a wig. The next sister WI\\I rightly\nDigitized by Google\n\fCe\u00b7rtnin Phenomena of T'lunce. 645\n:said to be more quiet. \"What has your mother done to thc housc 1 Your\nfather 8I\\ys it is all changed round.\" This was accepted by tIle sitter as corre-\nsponding to facts. But with this was a very large proportion of wrong or\nunrecognised statements. The medium was quite unable to tell him of a\ncomplaint from which he was suffering, even after a great deal of question-\ning and help.\n70. Mr. F. W. II. Myers. Fifth sitting. Jamlart) 24th.\n71. Mr. F. W. II. Myel\u00b7s. SiJlh nttillg. Jan'luu-y 25th.\nIn these sittings some private facts as to deceased friends were given as\nto which it is practically impossible that Mrs. Piper could have acquired\nany information.\n72. Mr. E. M. KOII<damm. Second sitting. Janum'y 25th.\nThe greater part of this sitting was taken up with extensions of, and addi-\ntions to, statements made at the preceding. The sitter was told rightly that\nhis name was Edwin, after several attempts. His surname was given as\n\"Kelliston\"; and he was 8I\\id to have no second Christian name. It should\nbe mentioned that his surname was not known to Mr. Myers, in whose hous8\nthe sitting took place. He was 8I\\id to have an aunt in the spirit named\n\"Adda\"; he has a deceased aunt named Adele. He was rightly 8I\\id to\nhave three nephews, sons of his sisters, all boys, two of them brothers.\nABked about\" Julian,\" Dr. P. described him correctly, and 8I\\id that he had\nmental trouble, of which he gave a true account, including an unusual cir-\ncumstance. Mr. K. was told that he knew one Allen, a smart fellow, but\nlame. This the sitter is inclined to refer to Mr. Rider Haggard's \"Allan\nQuatennain,\" whose adventures he had just been reading. This would\nevidently be important if it could be verified, but unfortunately the name is\nnot one which can be regarded as anything but a possible means of fishing.\nIt is not characteristic enough to be of any value. There was less which was\nquite wrong in this sitting than in the preceding.\n73. Mr. II. B((bill.gfm~ BmW,. Jam~Clry 26th.\nNothing of significance occurred in this sitting with the exception of a\ndescription of Mr. Smith's occupation, where a pretty good accollnt was\ngiven of the portfolios in which it is his business to enter reporta in the\nEducation Office. This began, however, with the wrong statement, \"You\nhave got a number of papers before you with pictures on them-pictures of\ndifferent colours. They have got to do with your life.\" Then the description\nbecame correct. \"Books in connexion with you ; some of them open and\nsome folded.

ASD II.\nSPECIALLY DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN BY DIREC'!' THOUGIIT-TRAXSFKRESC~::\ni.e., BY Al;'Y AGENCY EXERTED BY TilE SITTER.\nBy PROFESSOR LODGE.\n'{Jnless the evidence now given be held to constitute a sufficiently\nstrong proof that the performances of this particular \"medium\" are\nnot explicable by cunning and imposture, it is premature to examine\nfurther iuto their significance. But as soon as it can be unreservedly\ngrantoo that it is allowable to dismiss this hypothesis then it seems to\nme that the best plan is to dismiss it tho!'Oughly and waste no more\ntime over it.\nF!'Om this point of view there remains the hypothesis that the\ninformation is deri\\'ed f!'Om the sitter's mind in some way or other:\ne.g., (a) by question and answer; (b) by muscular and other semi-occult\na.nd unconscious signalling; (c) by direct mind-reading, or influence of\nthe sitter's thought, conscious 01' otherwise, acting on the entl'anced\nperson as percipient.. I do not propose to critically distinguish between\nthese three methods, although the first is very ancient, the second only\nrecently recognised in its full deyelopment and power, while the thinl\nis ollly in process of being accepted by scientific men.\nA large number of instances can be easily found which al'e not.\nexplicahle hy either (ct) or (b), and to all those who have hitherto-\nspent any labour over the records it has become clear that either (c) or\nsome eyen less admissihle hypothesi'! is necessary to explain a lal'ge\nportion of the results.\n'Vithout assuming that this conyiction will commend itself to\neverybody who may henceforth make a detailed study of the mattei',\nit does seem likely that to the majority it will. And so, until\nevidence to the contrary is forthcoming, I conclude that it will save\ntime to accept it provisionally and thus to nar!'Ow the question which\nfaces us to the following: Is thought-transference from the sitter, of\nhowever free and unconscious a kind, a complete and sufficient mode of\naccounting for the facts 1 Mr. Leaf definitely takes the position that,\nin his opinion it is sufficient, and, considering the large amount of\nlaboUl' he has spent on the documents, hi'! opinion is entitled to very\ngreat weight. For myself, I am not so convinced, but I cordially\nadmit the difficulty of any disproof of his position.\nIf one met a stranger in a railway-carriage who professed to ha\\\"(~\nreturned from the Colonies where he had met one's fl'iends or relations,\nof whom he showed knowledge in some decided ways, it would not at\nDigitized by Google\n\fA Re('orcl of Observati.ons of\nfirst occur to one to doubt his Yerncity, even though he was a litHe\nhazy about the names of relatives, and occasionally mixed things up;\nJlor would you stigmatise him as a deceiver if he occasionally made\nuse of information supplied by yourself in course of com\"ersa.tion_\nBut directly it was suggested that he might be a thought-reader, detail-\ning to you the uncoJlscious contents of your own mind, it would not be\neasy rigorously to disprove the suggestion, especially if subsequent\n.access to the friends chiefly mentioned were denied you. This is, how-\n\u00b7m\"er, very nearly, the problem before us.\nLet it be clearly understood that the first question is whether any\nreading of the mind of eluJ Bitter can be considered sufficiently effica-\n~ious. That 8011Ul mind is read I should think most probable; the\nquestion is not between mind-reading and something quite distinct; it,\nis between reading the mind of the sitter and reading the mind of\nsomeone else. There is yet another kind of mind-reading, if such it\ncan be called, which, though difficult to formulate and contemplate,\nyet frequently suggests itself, viz., the gaining of knowledge through\nsome hidden community of mind, through the existence of some central\nworld-mind, an idealistic concept.ion not unknown in philosophy; but\nit is sufficient for the present to indicate this as a possible notion and\npass on.\nThere are three methods of reading the mind of the sitter, labelled\nabove (a), (b), and (c). Method!! of extracting information from distant\npersons are fewel\u00b7. Correspondence is one; telepathy may, I suppose, be\nassumed to be another. The only method known to science of extrnct-\ning information from deceased persons is the discovery of documents.\nNow, in respect of correspondence and documents it is comparati,\"ely\neMY to be assured as to the use or non-use of these methods in any\nparticular case. Eliminating them, if anything is obtained inexplicable\nby the agency of the sitter, it is to telepathy that we must look for a.\npossible explanation. Telepathy from distant persons if that is in any\nway feasible, telepathy from deceased persons only as a last resort, but\ntelepathy of some kind, as distinct from any conceivable method of\nextrncting information from persons present: that seems to be the alter-\nnative hypothesis, to an examination of which we find ourselves forced\nby an attentive study of the records.\nNow, as Mr. Leaf says, only occasionally does the question arise;\nmost facts asserted are, of course, within the knowledge of the sittel\u00b7,\nund none of those are of any use for the purpose of discrimination;\nhut enry now and then facts, often very tl;vial but apparent.ly not\nwithin the knowledge of the sitter, have been asserted, and haye be-an\nmore or less clearly verified afterwards; and ill order to assist a special\nstudy of these data, with the view of examining how fltr they are really\n,-o.lua1>le, I have made all index to them, which I append.\nDigitized by Google\n\fCertain Phe1wmena of Trctnl'e.\nThat the statements are made in a hazy and ill-defined manner is.\nobvious on the surface. We are evidently not in a region of clear and\nexact knowledge. Events are dimly perceived, and error is mixed\nwith truth, but we must take things as we find them. The question is,.\nare any facts perceived at all, no matter how dimly, whioh could\nnot possibly ha\\'e been known to any person present 1\nSome of the following points are stronger than others, and some-\nare admittedly weak. I at one time indicated against each that par-\nticular \"explanation\" which might with least forcing be conceived ro\napply to that particular case. In most of such hypothetical explana-\ntiOll.'i \"thought-transference from laps~-memory\" was postulated;\ninformation derived from some previous sitter was also a possibility\nnot to be ignored. Wherever both of these were obviously inappli-\ncable one had to fall back upon \" coincidence\" or \"chance\" j and in\nseveral cases not even these would do. I now decide to omit all these\ngratuitous suggestions j anyone can supply them if he thinks fit, and\neveryone must decide for himself, after a study of the record, what\nexplanation is the least unlikely and how far any explanation is really\nadequate_\nList qf Incidents unknoll1R to, or forgotten by, or unknowable to,\nlHws0n8 present.\nNo. of Sittinu.

I regret to be unable to furnish you with any direct\nnotes of sittings beyond those which Mr. Hodgson wiII have ah,(,MY\nsupplied. I admit that in not having taken more notes I was most\nderelict, and can only cry jJeccavi. The excuse (if it be one) for my\nnegligence was that I wished primarily to satisfy myself about Mrs.\nPiper; and feeling that as evidence for others no notes but steno-\ngl'llphic notes would have value, and not being able to get these, I\nseldom took any. I stilI think that as far as influencing public opinion\ngoes, the bare fact that So-and-so and So-and-so have been convinced by\ntheir personal experience that \"there is something in mediumship\" is\nthe essential thing. Public opinion follows leaders much more than it\nfollows evidence. Professor Huxley's bal'e\" endorsement\" of MI'S\nPiper, e,g., would be more effective than volumes of notes by such as I\nPractically, however, I ought to have taken them, and the sight of you!\"\nmOJ'e scientific methods makes me doubly rue my sins.\nUnder the circumstances, the only thing I can do is to give you\nIlly present state of belief as to Mrs. Piper's powel'S, with a simple\nnccount from memory of the steps which have led me to it.\nI made Mrs. Piper's acquaintance in the autumn of 1885. }\\[y\nwife's mother, Mrs. Gibbens, had been told of hel' by a f!\"iend, during\nthe previous summe!\", and never having seen a medium before, had\npaid he!\" a visit out of curiosity. She l'etu1'lled with the statement\nthat )Irs. P. had given her a long string of names of mcmbe!\"s of the\nfamily, mostly Christian names, together with facts ahout the pel'SOns\nmentioned and their relations to each other, the knowledge of which\non her part was incomprehensible without supernol\"DJaI powel'S. My\nRister-in-law went the next day, with stilI better I'esults, as she related\nthem. Amongst other things, the medium had accUl'lltely described\nthe circumstances of the writer of a letter which she held against her\nforehead, after :lEss G. had given it to her. The lette!\" was in Italian,\nand its writer was known to but two persons in this country.\n[1 may add that on a later occasion my wife I1mI I took another\nletter from thi..1 sarn3 person to M!\"8. P., who went on to speak of him\nin a way which identifier! him unmistakably again. On a third\n~)ccasion, two years later, my sister-in-law amI I being again with Mrs.\nDigitized by Google\n\f652 A Rtcord of ObHel\"Vcdions of\nP., she l-e,\u00b7el\u00b7ted in her trance to these letters, and then ga\\'e us the\nwriter's name, which she said she had not been able to get on the\nformer occasion.]\nBut to revert to the beginning. I remember playing the upm fort\non that occasion before my feminine relatives, and seeking to explain\nby simple considerations the marvellous character of the facts which\nthey brought back. This did not, however, prevent me from going\nmyself a few days later, in company with my wife, to get a direct.\npersonal impression. The names of none of us up to this meeting had\nbeen announced to l\\Irs. P., and l\\Irs. J. and I were, of course, careful\nto make no reference to our relatives who had preceded. The medium,\nhowe\"er, when entranced, repeated most of the names of \"spirits \"\nwhom she had announced on the two former occasions and added others.\nThe names came with difficulty, and were only gradually made perfect_\nMy wife's father's name of Gibbens was announced first as Niblin, then\nas Giblin. A child Herman (whom we had lost the previous year) bad\nhis name spelt out as Herrin. I think that in no case were both\nChristian and SUl\"llames given on this visit. But thefilCt.s lJredicateci of\nthe pel'sons named marle it in many instances impossible not to l\"eCognise\nthe particular individuals who were talked about. 'Ve took particular\npains on this occasion to give the Phinuit control no help over his\ndifficulties and to ask no leu.ding questions. In the light of subsequent.\nexperience I believe this not to be the best lJOlicy. For it often happens,\nif you give this trance-personu.ge a name or some small fact for the lack\nof which he is brought to a standstill, that he will then start off with a.\ncopious flow of additional talk, containing in itself an abundance of\n\" tests.\"\nMy impression after this first visit was, that l\\Irs. P. was either\nposse&'1ed of supernormal powers, or knew the members of my wife's\nflLmily by sight and had by some lucky coincidence become acquainted\nwith such a multitude of their domestic circumstances as to produce\nthe startling impression which she did. l\\Iy lu.ter knowledge of her\nsittings and pel\"SOnal acquaintance with her has led me absolutely to\nr~ject the latter explanation, and to believe that she has supernormal\npowers.\nI yisited her 1\\ dozen times that winter, sometimes alone, sometime...\nwith my wife, once in company with the Rey. 1\\1. J. Savage. I sent u.\nlarge number of persons to her, wishing to get the results of as many\nfirst sittings as possible. I made appointments myself for most of these\npeople, whose names were in no instance announced to the medium. 111\nthe lipring of 1886 I published a brief\" Report of the Committee on\nMediumistic Phenomena\" in the Proceedings of the American Society\nfor Pliychical Research, of which the following i.. an extract :-\n\" I have myself witnessed a dozen of her trances, and have testimony at\nDigitized by Google\n\fOertain PhenO'lnena of Trance. 653\nfirst hand from 25 sitters, all but one of whom were virtually introduced\nto Mrs. P. by myself.1 Of five of the sittings we have rerbatim steno-\ngraphic reports. Twelve of the sitters, who in most cases sat singly, got no-\nthing from the mediwn but unknown names or trivial talk. Four of these\nwere members of the Society, and of their sittings verbatim reports were\ntsken. Fifteen of the sitters were surprised at the communications they\nreceived, names and facts being mentioned at the first interview which it;\nseemed improbable should have been known to the medium ina normal way.\nThe probability that she possessed no clue as to the sitter's identity was, I\nbelieve, in each and all of these 15 cases, sufficient. But of only one of\nthem is there a stenographic report j so that, unfortW1&tely for the medium,\nthe evidence in her favour is, although more abundant, less exact in quality\nthan some of that which will be counted against her. Of these 15\nsitters, five, all ladies, were blood relatives, and two (1 myself being one)\nwere men connected by marriage with the family to which they belonged.\nTwo other connections of this family are included in the 12 who got\nnothing. The medium showed a most startling intimacy with this family's\naffairs, talking of many matters known to no one outside, and which gossip\ncould not poBSibly have conveyed to her ears. The details would prove\nnothing to the reader, unleBS printed in extenso, with full notes by the\nsitters. It reverts, after all, to persoo.\"\\l conviction. My own conviction is\nnot evidence, but it seems fitting to record it. 1 am persuaded of the\nmedium's honesty, and of the genuineness of her trance; and although at\nfirst disposed to think that the 'hits' she made were either lucky coinci-\ndences, or the result of knowledge on her part of who the sitter was and of\nhis or her fauwy affairs, 1 now believe her to be in pOBBeBSion of a power as\nyet unexplained.\"\nI also made during this winter an attempt to see whether Mrs.\nPiper's medium-trance had any community of nature with ordinary\nhypnotic trance. I wrote in the report:-\n\" My first two attempts to hypnotise her were unsucc8BBful. Between\nthe second time und the third, 1 suggested to her 'control' in the medium-\ntrance that he should make her a mesmeric subject for me. He agreed. (A\nsuggestion of this BOrt made by the operator in one hYPlwtic trance would\nprobably have some effect on the next.) She became partially hypnotised\non the third trial; but the effect was 80 slight that 1 ascribe it rather to the\neffect of repetition than to the suggestion made. By the fifth trial she had\nbecome a pretty good hypnotic subject, as far as muscular phenomena and\nautomatic imitatioD.'I of speech and gesture go; but 1 could not affect her\ncOllSciousneBS, or otherwise get her beyond this point. Her condition in this\nsemi-hypnosis is very different from her medium-trance. The latter is\ncharacterised by great muscular unrest, even her ears moving vigorously in a.\nway impoBSible to her in her waking st.\"\\te. But in hypno.~is her muscular\nrelaxation and weakness are extreme. She often makes several efforts to speak\nI I tried then, and have tried since, to get written accounts from these Klttf>rs, in\nmo~t cast's in vain.

I must admit, however, thl1t Phinuit has other moods. He\nh,lS several times, when my wife and myself weloe sitting together with\nhim, suddenly started off on long lel'tures to Us about our inward defects\nDigitized by Google\n\f655\n;\\luI outward shortcomings, which were \"el'y earnest, as well as subtile\nmorally and psychologically, and impressh'e in a high degree, These\ndiscourses, though gi\"en ill Phinuit's'own person, were very diffel'ent\nin style from his more usual tnlk, and probably superior to a.nything\nthat the medium could produce ill the same line in her natural state.\nPhinuit himself, however, bears e,'ery appeal'ance of being a fictitious\nbeing, His French, so far as he hus been able to display it to me, ha.~\nbaen limited to a few phrases of salutation, which may easily have\nhad their rise in the medium's\" unconscious\" memory; he hus never\nbeen able to understand my French; and the crumbs of information\nwhich he gives about his earthly career nre, as you know, so few, vague,\nand unlikely sounding, as to suggest the l'omancing of olle whose stock\nof ma.terials for invention is exceslSively reduced. He is, however, as he\n.actually shows himself, a definite human individual, with immense tact\nand pntience, and great desire to plen..'le and be regarded as inflillible.\n'With l'elSpect to the rough nud slangy style which he so often affects,\nit should be said that the Spiritualistic tradition here in America is nil\nin fnvour of the\" spirit-contl'OI\" being Ii grotesque and somewhat saucy\npan;onage. The Zeit!leidt has n.lwnys much to do with shaping trance-\nphenomena, so that II. \"control\" uf that temperament is what one would\nnaturally expect. ~Ir. Hodgson will already have informed you of the\nsimilltlity between Phinuit's name and that of the\" control\" of the\nmediulll at whose house }\\f1'S. Piper was first entranced. The most\nremllrkable thing about the Phinuit personality seems to me the extm-\nordinary tenacity and minuteness of his memory. The medium has\nbeen visited by many hundreds of sittel'S, half of them, perhaps, being\nstrangers who have come but once. To each Phiuuit gives an hour-\nful of disconnected fmgmentl:! of talk ahout pen;ons living, dead, 01'\nimaginary, and events past, future, or unreal. What nonnal waking\nmemory could keep this chaotic muss of stuff together 1 Yet Phiuuit\ndoes so; for the chances seem to lie, that if a sitter should go back aftel'\nyears of interval, the mediulll, when once entranced, would recall the\nminutest incidents of the p-arlier interview, and begin by recapituhlting\nmuch of whn.t had then been said. So far as I can discover, :\\11'l1.\nPiper's WIlking memory is not l'emarkable, and the whole constitution\nof her trance\u00b7memory is something which I am at a loss to undel'Stand.\nBut I will say nothing more of Phinuit, because, aided by our fliends ill\nFrance, you are already systematically seeking to establish or disprove\nhim n..~ a fonner native of this world.\nPhinuit is generally the medium of communication between other\nspilits and the sitter. But two other sQi-disant spirits have, in my Pl'e-\n,;ence, assumed dil'ect \"control\" of :Mrs. Piper. One purported to be the\nlate }\\fr. E. The other was an aunt of mine who died last yenr in\nNew York. I have already sent you the only account I can give of\n2 y 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f656 A Record of Observations of\nmy earliest experiences with the \"E. control.\" The first. messages.\ncame through Phinuit, about a. year ago, when after two years of non-\nintercourse with Mrs. Piper, she lunched one day at our house and\ngave my wife and myself a sitting afterwards. It was bad enough;\nand I confess that the human being in me was so much stronger than\nthe man of science that I was too disgusted with Phinuit's tiresome\ntwaddle even to note it down. \\Vhen later the phenomenon developed\ninto pretended. direct speech from E. himself I regretted this, for a.\ncomplete record would have been useful. I ean now merely say that\nneither then, nor at any other time, was there to my mind the slightest\ninner verisimilitude in the personation. But the failure to produce I\\\"\nmore plausible E. speaks directly in favour of the non-participation\nof the medium's conscious mind in the performance. She could so easily\nhave coached herself to be more effective.\nHer trance-talk about my own family shows the same innocenc(>_\nThe sceptical theory of her successes is that she keeps a sort of detec-\ntive bureau open upon\u00b7 the world at large, so that whoeyer may call is\npretty sure to find her prepared with facts about his life. Few things.\ncould have been easier, in Boston, than for lfrs. Piper to collect facts.\nabout my own father's family for use in my sittings with her. But\nalthough my father, my mother, and a deceased brother were repeatedly\nannounced as present, nothing but their bare names ever came out.\nexcept a. hearty message of thanks from my father that I had \"pub-\nlished the book.\" I Turd published hi'! Literary Remains,. but when\nPhinuit was a'!ke:i \"what book 1\" all he could do was to spell the\nletters L, I, and say no more. If it be suggested that all this was but\na refinem:mt of cunning, for that such skilfully distributell reticence....\nare what bring most cI'edit in to a. medium, I must deny the proposition\nin toto. I have seen amI heard enough of sittings to be sure tha.t Il.\nmedium's trump cards are promptitude and completeness in hel-\nrevelations. It is a mistake in general (however it may occasionally.\nas now, be cited in her flt\"our) to keep back anything she knows.\nPhinuit's stumbling, spelling, and otherwise imperfect ways of bringing\nout his facts is a great drawba.ck with most sittel\"S, and yet it is habitual\nwith hint.\nThe aunt who purported to \"take control\" directly was a much\nbetter personation, haying a good deal of the cheery strenuousness of\nspeech of the original. She spoke, by the way, on this occasion, of the\ncondition of health of two members of the family in New York, of\nwhich we knew nothing at the time, and which was afterwards cor-\nr..lborated by letter. 'Ye have repeatedly he:u'd from MI\"S. Piper in\ntrance things of which we wel'e not ut the moment aware. If the\nsupernormal element in the phenomenon be thought-transference it is\ncf.ll'tainly not that of the sitter's cOliSCioU8 thuught, It is rather the\nDigitized by Google\n\fCel-tccin Phenomena of Trance. 657\nreservoir of his potential knowledge which is tapped; and not always\nt}U\/,t, but the knowledge of some distant living person, as in the\nincident last quoted. It has sometimes even seemed to me that too\nmuch intentness on the sitter's part to have Phinuit say a certain thing\nacts as a hindrance.\nMrs. Blodgett, of Holyoke, Mass., and her sister, devised, before\nthe latter died, what would have been a good test of actual spirit-\nreturn. The sister, Miss H. W., wrote upon her deathLed a letter,\n~ealed it, and gave it to Mrs. B. After her death no one living\nknew what words it contained. Mrs. B. not then knowing Mrs. Piper,\n-entrusted to me the sealed letter, and asked me to give Mrs. Piper some\narticles of the deceased sister's personal apparel, to help her to get at\nits contents. This commission I performed. Mrs. P. gave correctly\nthe full name (which even I did not know) of the writer, and finally,\nafter a delay and ceremony which occupied several weeks on Phinuit's\npart, dictated what purported to be a copy of the letter. This I\n-compared with the original (of which Mrs. B. permitted me to break\nthe seal); but the two letters had nothing in common, nor were\nany of the numerous domestic facts alluded to in the medium's letter\nacknowledged by Mrs. Blodgett to be correct. Mrs. Piper was equally\nunsuccessful in two later attempts which she made to reproduce the\ncontents of this document, although both times the revelation purport\u20acd\nto come direct from it.'i deceased writer. It would be hard to devise a\nbetter test than this would have been, had it immediately succeeded, for\nthe exclusion of thought-trallSference from living minds.\nMy mother-in-law, on her return from Europe, spent a morning\nvainly seeking for her bank-book. 1\\Jrs. Piper, on being shortly after-\nwards asked where this book was, described the place so exactly that it\nwas illStantly found. I was told by her that the spirit of a boy named\nRobert F. was the companion of my lost infant. The F.'s were\n<:ousins of my wife living in a distant city. On my return home I\nmentioned the incident to my wife, saying, \"Your cousin did lose a.\nbaby, didn't she 1 but Mrs. Piper was wrong about its sex, name, and\nage. \" I then learned that Mrs. Piper had been quite right in a.U\nthose particulars, and that mine was the wrong impression. But,\nobviously, for the source of revelatiollS such as these, one need not go\nbehind the sitter's own storehouse of forgotten or unnoticed experi-\nences. Miss X.'s experiments in crystal-gazing prove how strangely\nthese survive. If thought-trallSference be the clue to be followed\nin interpreting Mrs. Piper's trance-utterances (and that, as far as my\nexperience goes, is what, far more than any supramundane illStillations,\nthe phenomena. Beem on their face to be) we must admit that the\n4' trallSference\" need not be of the conscious or even the unconscious\nthought of the sitter, but must often be of the thought of some person\nDigitized by Google\n\f..,58 A RrCOl'd of Obl<('\/'!'((l iOllR of\nfar IIway.
