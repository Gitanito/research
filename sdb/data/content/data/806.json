See the daylight \r\n Streaks with gold the eastern sky.  \r\n See the shadows, slow retreating.  \r\n From the morning\u2019s radiant greeting.  \r\n And the earth is bathed in glory.\r\n Never, never known before.\n\n Yes, 'tis coming.  Equal labor,\r\n Equal comforts for us all.\r\n None shall rest in ease and ennui\r\n While with some the hard earned penny\r\n Doled out by disdainful fingers\r\n Scarce keeps want from out their door--\r\n Yes, 'tis coming.\u201d\n\n This is clearly the product of a believer--and an educated one at that, if \"ennui\"is any indication. The journal carried short articles by John Murray Spear, J.M. Matthews, and by someone called \"the Exile,\"and favorably refers to Victoria C. Woodhull (who was running for president at the time).
