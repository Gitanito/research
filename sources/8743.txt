  		      1933.        Carlos CP NDE       6/10/2009.      NDE 4013.       From Spain, original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon A.      Suddenly I saw myself floating (I never saw my physical body), amazed, asking myself: 'What's this? Where am I'? I was floating, without a body, but still I could move around, in short I had an 'I'. I spent some time feeling disconcerted, it was like a dream but I still remember it as being too real to be a dream. Then all of a sudden I found myself in a room, where my mother, and one of my aunts who was not in the hospital at the time, were weeping inconsolably, seated on maroon-colored, very brightly colored, armchairs. At this point, I said to myself: 'Ah, that means I'm dead!' I started to feel a peace and wellbeing which is indescribable.  
   Child NDE.   

    1932.        Mari Luz CB NDE       6/10/2009.      NDE 4003.       From Spain, original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon A.      I was looking down on the whole schoolyard from above, as though floating in the air, and could see my fellow-players weeping and crying out. I was to their right; the teacher had his back to me, kneeling over a girl who was laid out on the ground. Approaching, I asked what was going on, but nobody answered me. The teacher was shaking her and slapping her with the palm of his hand on her face, and at this point, I realized that the girl on the ground being slapped was me. I had my mouth open and my eyes were open too, but vacant. The teacher (at the same time as he tried to revive me) was shouting, 'Oh my God, Oh my God, wake up!' From my position (above and to the right of the whole scene) I could see everything that happened over the whole schoolyard with great clarity, the children and the people by the fence.  
   Child NDE.   

    1931.        Cynthia Y NDE       6/7/2009.      NDE 4020.             I saw everything, the whole universe from the beginning of time. And time is something humans made up, there is no such thing as time this is all a series of events. It was like a big paisley of cosmos being formed in front of me and I had superman vision. (I told a friend what I saw and he turned me on to fractals it looked like that.) I was hanging in the dark space and our universe was below me like a teacup saucer inside of a thirty-three gallon trash bag. I was in the bag still. I was beyond the far reaches of the universe. Beyond the universe looking at it with superman vision and I could see earth and my house and inside it and all from a bazillion, gazillion, light years past the edge of the universe. It was really amazing.  
   NDE due to respiratory arrest from asthma.   

    1930.        Jacqueline M Father Experiences       6/7/2009.      Secondhand NDE and Experiences 4019.       From Australia.      Dad relayed to me what happened just prior to Danny taking his last breath.  Dad saw two large Angels enter the room and stand on either side of the bed not touching the ground, dad heard Danny take his last breath and then Danny with the two Angels stood at the foot of dad's bed. One of the angels said to dad we will be back for you in two weeks' time. Dad died exactly two weeks to the day that Danny died. He told me that when he saw Danny's soul that he was happy and rejuvenated. Another thing dad told me - do not be afraid of death as it is like walking through a door.  
   Several experiences in the spectrum of NDE.   

    1928.        Cynthia M NDE       6/7/2009.      NDE 4017.             I opened my back door to get air and when I looked outside there was this beautiful blue-white light coming from the sky. I could see very far as if a nuclear bomb had went off outside. It was 3:30 am and I could see for miles it seemed. I couldn't hear anything and it was so peaceful. I wasn't afraid. Which surprises me. A picture of my daughters flashed in my mind I guess. My oldest was first and then my youngest. I said the words, 'GOD I am not ready.' The light slowly started to return to the sky and my body took a deep breath. The paramedics arrived a few moments later and my BP was 226/182.  
   NDE associated with severe high blood pressure.   

    1927.        Brandy M Probable FDE       6/7/2009.      Probable FDE 4016.             The sky, although it had been sunny before, was now slightly overcast.  It was not unpleasant - the clouds had a blue, gray, pink and yellow tinge to them, as though the sun was trying to break through. There were absolutely no people on the beach, which was odd, since before, the beach was packed with people. I wasn't scared at that point - I was actually completely at peace. I just wanted to remain there, observing the beach, the sea (what I could see of it) and the gorgeous sky above me. No, I didn't hear any voices like you'd expect, and no, Jesus or any other religious figures did not appear to me. I just stood there in the ocean and continued to review my life as I had done before. There was actually no break in my stream of consciousness between reviewing my life before this new landscape, and while I was observing it.  
   Probable fear-death experience.  In the spectrum of experiences of NDE.  A good example of how difficult it often is to categorize experiences.   

    1927.        John C Probable NDE       6/7/2009.      Probable NDE 4018.             I have learned much throughout my life; however, my learning curve was significantly more - steep during and immediately after my coma. Here are some of the insights/revelations that were shared with me. My life did 'flash' before me; however, this 'review' did not stop at my birth. My recollection was going back in time and 'space' well before my birth. A time and place best described as Eden-like. I have a 'recollection' of landing at the bottom of a significant hill in a 'sea' of 'people' I then climbed to the crest of the hill passed between two rocks and 'interacted' with two human-like 'persons'. They communicated to me in unison...  
   Probable NDE due to apparent brain hemorrhage.   

    1926.        Andrea K Possible NDE       6/7/2009.      Possible NDE 4015.       From Germany.      This woman??? showed me things I do not remember all. She said to me, 'This is what it will be like when you come here.' I then saw a seashore, or something like it, and the air seemed to be blue. All was blue. I felt as if I was looking from the right upper corner from somewhere and I felt her next to me at all times. She was so calm. I saw people on this seashore and I seemed to know these people even though I have never seen them in this dimension. I felt such love and I felt so much love from them. There was one woman she seemed to be close to me. I was able to hold her hands, we looked at each other, and I felt love yet sadness. Then this Being next to me said that it was time to go now and I will see them again but it was not my time yet.  
   Possible NDE vs. Probable Anesthesia Experience. Very NDE-like content.   

    1925.        Vincent L NDE       6/7/2009.      NDE 3998.       From Italy, translated into English by Maurizio B.      A moment later I was about ten meters above the thread of light which held the street lighting lamp (this thread is about fifteen meters above the road as well). I did not understand where I was, but I felt good and no pain. I was just surprised. I saw only the wire with the lamp. After a while, I began to understand where I was. I looked around and saw from a distance (approximately seventy meters) a figure on the ground at the edge of the pavement. It was my mother who held a baby in her arms. I felt a sudden urge such that I had started down toward the scene.  
   NDE as a child.   

    1924.        Joseph U NDE       4/24/2009.      NDE 22053.             As I fell and my friend fell on me I blacked out.  At this time, I looked down on myself lying there with my friends around me. I could hear what they were saying and what was going on. I heard the TV and the commercials and I was watching. I felt myself kind of floating above them near the ceiling and I could see down the hallway. I was able to see my friends who were in the hallway. I could see what they were doing. I don't believe I was dead, but I could hear my friends discussing their worries that I was unconscious. They were slapping my face. One friend went to get water to splash on me. We were young and they didn't know what to do to revive me. As soon as I saw them about to splash water on me, I felt myself being pulled back into my body. I awoke and was a little confused what had happened to me. As I started to feel better, I started to ask them questions about what they were saying and to my surprise, it was accurate. Then I went down the hallway, found my friends, and asked them if what I saw them, doing was the truth. They both confirmed that they were playing with a ball and throwing it back and forth. I was shocked and so was everyone else.  
   NDE due to injury while playing with friends resulting in unconsciousness.  Happened at age 16.   

    1923.        Sharon W Probable NDE       4/24/2009.      Probable NDE 22048.             My brother knew what was happening but he thought that a piece of hamburger was lodged in my throat.  He saw me try to take breaths twice and could get no air. He started panicking and beating on me.  Well it took me one more attempt at trying to get a breath with no luck to realize that something was drastically different this time.  I was not breathing in the natural sense, yet wondering why my brother was in a panic. By my fourth attempt at breathing with no success, I realized I might not be breathing in the natural way but in my mind I had enough air for everybody and it was wonderful.  It was the complete opposite of the first time; it was like taking a walk through heaven, I had no worries except my brother beating me up in his attempt to save me. Suddenly the choking stopped and I was completely ecstatic, but I could never really explain all that I felt, I really felt Jesus was breathing for me. I was never aware of any discomfort.  
   Probable NDE from choking.   

    1922.        Sheri C NDE       5/30/2009 & 10/10/2010.      NDE 4749/4010.             Then I came out of what seemed like a cave.  It opened up into a beautiful sky.  I was in the clouds, like on top of a mountain.  I looked ahead and I saw a man in a brown robe motioning me to come towards him.  As I got closer, I noticed he looked like Santa Clause.  He had a white beard and was very gentle looking.  He told me to get into his boat and that he would take me home to the other side.  I got in the boat with him and we talked.  As we got further away from the shore, I began to feel uneasy.  I asked him to stop, and then I asked him to please take me back.  He stopped the boat and asked me, ‘Are you sure?' I said, ‘Yes, I am sure, please take me back. I need to be with my husband.  I need to be with him, please, please take me back.’  
   NDE due to complication of delivering a baby.   

    1921.        Don C NDE       5/30/2009.      NDE 4009.             While being operated on the surgeon severed an artery in my neck and I bleed to death. I remember floating in the corner of the room above the operating table looking down at myself wondering what was going on. Then all of a sudden I was pulled through this tunnel to a white light where I found myself standing on this golden brick road leading up to some kind of building that had twelve pillars along the side and front with steps leading up to a personage seated on a throne. This person got up and came down the stairs and down the road to me. All around me, I could see and feel a beautiful peace and tranquility with love and peace. I had no care in the world. Also as far as the eye could see to my left was a beautiful landscape of tulips of every color imaginable. To my right was a wall of a beautiful blue that matched the sky.  
   NDE due to surgical complication at age fifteen.   

    1920.        Carmel B NDE      6/30/2009 & 5/30/2009.      NDE 4055/4006.       From Australia      There was a man waiting by the tree, not speaking, just watching me, waiting for me to notice him. I was still 'in the light'. It made the ground look like a cloud but it felt solid. I knew there was more in this place but all I could see through the light were the gates, this man and the tree. I walked up to the man and said 'Hello'.  My voice echoed. He smiled at me and held out a hand. It was the hand of a workman. I took his hand but I have no recall of warmth, then he hugged me and walked me over to the tree where we sat. He started to talk, explaining that he was Jesus, my great grandfather and that I was there by accident and that I needed to go back.  
   2 NDEs   

    1919.        Ann T Possible NDE       5/30/2009.      Possible NDE 4004.             But about forty-five minutes later I was looking down at myself from the ceiling of the air plane. Somehow, I could see around the corner into the meal preparation area to and at the same time, I was looking down at myself. Then simultaneously I could see straight down the aisle from the back of the plane, all the while I could see in that very moment the flight stewardess around the corner preparing food, all the while in that very second I was looking straight down at my body as if I was perched on the ceiling. I knew something extraordinary was happening and I immediately suspected I had died or something. I kept looking down from the ceiling at myself, trying to see if I was breathing. I wasn't ready to die. At one point it appeared to me that my chest was rising and falling and at another point I couldn't be sure.  
   Possible NDE due to severe illness.   

    1918.        Elaine J NDE       5/30/2009.      NDE 4001.             My memories of the incident were seeing the truck headed towards me as I was stopped behind the bus - I could see it approaching in my rearview mirror - and I thought 'I'm going to die and I'm really going to miss my kids.' Then the airbag blew up in my face and I was in this amazing golden light - and it felt like joy all around me, I felt fabulous - no pain, no worries, complete contentment and the warm light was 'God' or my idea of God. I felt loved and cared for and precious - which was fabulous - and it seemed like everything made sense, it was like an 'Ah hah' moment. This presence didn't tell me it was God - that was my later determination, we try to ascribe labels to things that shouldn't have labels. Anyway, this intense energy force wanted to be with me and that was all I cared about at that time. Then suddenly I was watching from above my jeep.  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    1917.        Selosse NDE       5/28/2009.      NDE 3992.       From France. Original in French translated by Simon A.      My knee struck the rocks with such force that I fainted from the pain. For a while, I ceased to exist - then darkness, a clear sensation of floating, during which my mind continued to function. I said to myself, 'Ah, well, here you are then, this is death for you! It's not so bad as all that, after all.' At this point an unknown, but very clear voice, said to me: 'No, you're not going to die, it's really not your time yet (with the implication 'you'll live to be very old') and you're going to get out of this.'  
   Went unconscious during a swimming accident.   

    1916.        Adam D NDE       5/23/2009.      NDE 3999.             We peaked up to the top of the hill and the four-wheeler flipped, my dad ended up falling away from the four-wheeler, but the four-wheeler fell right on top of me and the gas tank punctured my spleen and I immediately passed out. I woke up for a few seconds seeing somebody telling me to wake up, but I passed out again. Right there I began floating above my body just watching, without any concern, just watching as they put me on the stretcher. They put me in the ambulance truck and I couldn't see inside, then I remember just being in a light for a while.  
   NDE due to accident at age four.   

    1915.        Cinta J NDE       5/23/2009.      NDE 3997.       From the UK.      I was just in another place, somewhere I'd always been. These people knew me and I knew them. I had no memory at all of any previous life. It was more real to me than anything else I'd ever experienced, but the most important thing was, that these people were so lovely. They were kind, funny, loving, and considerate. It was like having happiness running through your veins.  
   NDE due to what I would guess to be a seizure prior to diagnosis of brain tumor, and NDE during surgery to remove tumor.   

    1914.        Edith C Probable NDE       5/21/2009.      Probable NDE 3991.       From Argentina. Original in Spanish translated to English by Simon A.      I came into a place where children were playing games, it looked like a public square, a very broad space, where the colors were unusually brilliant to see, and everything seemed very calm, with no anxieties. It was a peacefulness, which is very difficult to put into words. Someone accompanied me. I suppose it would have been a woman, because she had a brown skirt on. Suddenly, I saw some children near to me; my attention was drawn to a very pretty little girl. I was very happy and was following her.  Suddenly, I saw a little boy, and he was sad. He tried to come near me, but the little girl whispered something to him and sent him away from me. I tried to reach him (the little girl was smiling at me), I stretched out my arm and the little boy just turned around, as if asking me for something. The 'person' at my side guided me in the other direction.  
   Probable NDE during surgery.   

    1913.        Paul H NDE       5/16/2009.      NDE 3994.             It seemed I was there for some time, but time really didn't exist there, but I never thought of 'Time' as I did on earth as it would have been useless I guess, or it just wasn't an existing thing there. There was no sound, which I really loved. It was like being in a soundproof chamber, but without walls. I remember I could see. I could look in all directions. I remember looking under me and over me and I saw nothing but light grey. It never dawned on me that when I looked under me, I was missing my earthly body. I remembered nothing of my earthly self. Or even that I had ever existed before now.  
   NDE due to complication of cardiac procedure with cardiac arrest.   

    1912.        David L NDE       5/16/2009.      Shared NDE 3990.             I thought, 'What is that?' My friend answered, 'I do not know, what is that?' focusing all my concentration. The images were distorted like the sunlight that shines on the bottom of a swimming pool. The dim fuzzy dark image was illuminated clear for only an instant by the brighter lines moving across the field of view.  I said to my friend, 'That is my brother's car.' I could see a police car to the left, a group of people behind the police car on the left, an ambulance to the right with a police car to the right of the ambulance. My friend said, 'That is us.' At that moment, we both said, 'We are dead.'  
   NDE due to auto accident at age seventeen. Part of NDE is a rare shared NDE, where he is interacting with another individual who died in the same auto accident.   

    1911.        Theresa O Possible NDE       5/16/2009.      Possible NDE 3989.             In the next instant, Jesus Christ himself reached down and picked me up. It was so much like the feeling I had felt when I was oh so small and so scared of a fire truck and my daddy had picked me up. I held him so close around his neck. I wanted to do the same, yet I felt so undeserving. As Jesus held me, I looked into his eyes - I will never forget how wonderful and awesome his eyes were! The first thing I said to him was, 'Do you hate me because I am a drug addict?' I will never forget what He said to me, 'NO. I only want you to know that I love you.' There were other things said and then he started to set me down and I said, 'Please don't leave me.' HE said, 'I will never give you more than you can handle.' Then I was back in my body.  
   Possible NDE associated with being poisoned by boyfriend.   

    1910.        Lee NDE       5/16/2009.      NDE 3987.       From the United Kingdom      I instantly shot out of my body, but I was not above myself. It was as if I was some kind of energy, and I was flying away from earth. Then it seemed as if I was flying away from the solar system. Then I started flying away faster and I saw bunches of stars as if they were galaxies flying away from me. Then they seemed to be bunching together into huge packs as if they were separate universes or something like that. It was as if there was a force or energy out there way bigger than anything we know, and I had an enormous sense of understanding the meaning of life, that's when I seemed to shoot back at a phenomenal speed! I then came round and realized I had been in a coma and must have died.  
   NDE during diabetic coma.   

    1909.        Neiva Y Probable NDE       5/16/2009.      Probable NDE 3986.             When I was around four years old, I had serious asthma. We didn't know it was asthma yet, so it wasn't treated. One night, I had a very, very severe asthma attack. Suddenly I was flying, slowly following an angel who was only partly visible down my stairs. It felt very real. I felt wonderful and calm and I wanted to keep following her for a long time. The light was so bright it was almost white. Then I realized that I wanted to be with my mom, and that I missed her. I wanted to go back to my normal life. Then, it felt like the angel was pulling me towards her, but at the same time, I was being sucked backwards. She released me, and I flew through my house back into my room. When we found out that what I had was asthma, the doctor said that I was very close to dying.  
   Probable NDE due to asthma at age four or five. Shared at age eleven - the youngest experiencer to have shared with NDERF so far.   

    1908.        Stacy D NDE       5/16/2009.      NDE 3985.             I had overdosed on a barbiturate, I had three times the lethal limit in my system. I was lying on the floor passed out when my mom just happened to come home early from work that day and found me. When the paramedics arrived, I was not breathing and my heart had stopped. While they were resuscitating me I recall clear as if it had happened yesterday sitting up out of my body and looking at a man who was sitting on the chair close to where my body was. I recall laughing as if I was incredibly happy to see him and I felt like I had known him my entire life. He was sitting down.  He had blondish brown hair and was wearing a white shirt with blue jeans. He had his face covered so I couldn't see it and he was shaking his head from side to side as if he was disappointed in me. The next thing I remember was opening my eyes to see the paramedics, who were both women, and my mom standing over me. I looked to where the man was sitting and there were no men present.  
   Suicide attempt from overdose of barbiturate.   

    1907.        Robert H Possible NDE       2/15/2009.      Possible NDE 22035.             I remember being transported to this new world it seemed like.  I remember seeing a brightly colored dome, spires, and living a whole life somewhere else. I remember being clothed in simple garb.  The feeling of love was enveloping all around me.  There was no fear or sorrow whatsoever.  I saw colors that seem to mix together in glimmering iridescence.  It was pure joy and happiness.  It felt more real than anything I've experienced on earth.  I did not want to leave and I was thrown back into my body it seemed.  I was so upset because I was ready to go.  
   Possible NDE from accident.   

    1906.        Charles S NDE       12/27/2008.      NDE 22034.             Fell off porch… five years old sitting atop electric pole watching mother and  friends trying to get me  to  come  back -- so I felt I should go back and I  did.  
   NDE at age 5 due to fall off porch and OBE at age 55.  Contributor is currently 87, thus NDE shared 82 years after its occurrence is currently an NDERF record.   

    1905.        Giambalvo NDE       5/16/2009.      NDE 3980.       From France. Original in French, translated to English by Simon A.      From where I fell, I could hear my best friend calling to find where I was. I was replying but he could not hear me. I saw him reach the spot and I saw my teacher lifting me in his arms. I also saw the ambulance arrive by road and park at the edge of the forest. I saw the paramedics get out of their vehicles. I did speak to my teacher, but no one could hear me, and from where I fell it would be impossible to see everything I saw, as I was right inside the forest with my view cut off, and unconscious.  
   NDE from a fall.   

    1904.        Jean-Marie P NDE       5/12/2009.      NDE 3963.       From Belgium. Original in French, translated to English by Simon A.      The only thing I am absolutely certain of, and which I could remember directly after the accident, is the flash, as I have always called it, though I was not dazzled. It was not so much a flash as a reverse flash. Actually, I was in the light, and the world appeared to me as a little black dot. Then this dot grew larger and larger, until I seemed to pass from one world to another. I was surrounded by light and then little by little the black dot, at first tiny, grew bigger, to finally absorb me. The transition came about at dizzying speed. Yet, I remember it as if it were yesterday, as I did when I came back.  
   NDE from a motorbike accident. This is an unusual one that shows the link between NDE and the need for the brain to be able to reach those NDE memories.   

    1903.        Anatole Probable NDE       5/11/2009.      Probable NDE 3982.             When I decided to give up trying to reach the shore and just let myself drown, suddenly everything seemed to stand totally still. I could clearly feel/see that the wind still blew, the water still lapped around me, the sun continued to shine bright and strong. I could feel these elements but they did not affect the void time/space that was created around me. Then I heard a voice directly in my mind. I clearly perceived that it came to me from above-left side. This being I did not perceive as being 'more' than myself. It was more like a 'similar' to myself. A telepathic dialogue took place in which certain questions were asked and I was compelled to answer truthfully. At the end, I made a decision and at that point, the 'void' stopped and, with difficulty, I made it back to the shore.  
   Probable NDE due to near drowning.   

    1902.        Carman D NDE       5/11/2009.      NDE 3977.             I was climbing up a long golden ladder up through the clouds, and I was climbing very, very high and at the end of the ladder there was a man (for me, it was God) who met me. He was of medium built with white shoulder length hair, with a white shiny white beard like angel hair and had on a white robe with sash. He took me by my hand and we walked towards a marble bench where he sat me in his lap. I felt very weak and tired from the long climb. As he sat me on his lap and laid in his arms, I reached up, touched his beard with my right hand, and felt the most immense sense of love and understanding (until this day this feeling has never left me). He stood me up and took me by the hand and as we were walking, we went to a white marble room where there was a huge screen and pictures of my life were flashing very fast. In the screen were the most surprising images that have never left me - they were of a previous life.  
   NDE at age five due to accidental overdose of anti-depressant medication, and NDE at age fifteen due to ether complication during dental procedure.   

    1901.        Andrew C NDE       5/11/2009.      NDE 3975.       From Romania.      I just got out of that state of unconsciousness to being aware that I found myself floating above the surgery room. I was surprised that I seemed to have no weight at all I was very light and movement was very easy compared to the physical movement. I looked down and saw my body and the doctors working on me, heard them yelling, 'We are losing him!'  
   NDE due to complication while under general anesthesia.   

    1900.        Karyl M NDE-Like       5/11/2009.      NDE-Like 3976.             It was time to go outside, and I was headed for the window. However, as I turned slowly, there was darkness, and a small light at the apparent end. In this tunnel, I could see glimpses of dark blue, purple and gold specks, illuminating the walls of this long and very quiet tunnel. The tranquility that was within there is now capturing my entire being, and was enough for this highly anxious girl to want to stay here for a long while. As I am floating toward the light, I felt compelled to continue this uncertain and positive experience. The light is becoming brighter and larger, and all I could feel is the presence of good, and now am for sure, this is where I need to be.  
   Very NDE-Like: OBE over body, tunnel, light at end of tunnel, being there gave her choice to return, back to body. No physical compromise.   

    1899.        Jessica G NDE       5/3/2009.      NDE 3972.             After a brief argument with the man, as I was trying to swim away from him, he pushed me underwater by my shoulders and held me there. I struggled against his hands on my shoulders, but was not able to come to the surface. When I was almost out of air, I looked up through the water at the face of my attacker. His expression was very frightening to me because he was smiling, but also appeared to be very angry. The perspective of my memory at that point changed from looking up at him to looking down at the top and back of his head and myself from above. I saw my body floating limply under water with my eyes open. At the same time the visual perspective of my memory changed, I remember the pain in my lungs, my feelings of panic and the urge to breathe stopped as well. I felt peaceful clarity. I was aware of the circumstances and knew I was dying. My face looked peaceful and oddly pretty. I was aware I had a choice and was happy to move on to the light behind me.  
   NDE due to criminal attack and drowning at age eleven.   

    1898.        Paeata BC NDE       5/3/2009.      NDE 3971.       From New Zealand      I saw all the richness of color with great clarity and all my other senses seemed to be working overtime and even I would say outside of normal experience so it was like an  extended awareness.  A second was an eternity and an eternity a second.  
   Multiple NDEs from asthma attacks.   

    1897.        Dave N NDE       5/3/2009.      NDE 3970.             I was in spirit outside of my body. I was outside of the hospital immediate care room hallway. A colleague of mine was headed down to see me. He stopped just outside of the immediate care doors to speak with someone. I was looking at him from above. I glanced around and saw the pictures on the wall; the one of the farmhouse setting is one that I had noted on my previous walk through the halls of the hospital when I was healthy. The look on his face was one of a grim reminder, he was shaking his head in a 'no' motion. I knew I would not make it.  
   NDE vs. Intensive Care Unit Hallucination. Complications after heart surgery and was in Intensive Care Unit twenty days. Had episodes of respiratory arrest, but event not clearly associated with these events.   

    1896.        Jan L Probable NDE       4/25/2009.      Probable NDE 3968.             During this time I recall looking around the recovery room and eventually, sitting up and moving. Being curious, I looked around the room to see what it looked like noticing the medical staff working in another portion of the room. Suddenly, I saw this beautiful white light slowly coming towards me. A man who had a kind gentle face dressed in a white cloth was before me. He stood to the right side of this ever-growing light. While I began to move in his direction, he was so welcoming and only spoke to me it seemed through his eyes. He asked me if I wanted to enter the light. I was overjoyed that he had come for me and loved me so much. I can't really describe the joy or calm I felt. I wanted to go with so badly. It felt like home.  
   Probable NDE following surgery at age sixteen.   

    1895.        Berta P NDE       4/25/2009.      NDE 3966.             I was sixteen years old, history of emotional, psychical and sexual abuse, intoxicated, involved in a severe motor vehicle accident that threw me a hundred and thirty-eight feet, landing on the pavement face first. I do not remember the impact, transportation to the hospital or treatment up until the time of death. I remember the code team working on me, and then they slowly turned and walked away. The M.D. had said that it was over; he was ending the resuscitation attempt (calling the code). I was floating in the air, up in the corner, above some equipment. I was looking down at everything. My vision was extremely clear and intense - as if being in a body was like being in a lens, and now it was clear. I felt wonderful - no body sensations, pain, or density. Everything was light and pure, beyond anything describable.  
   NDE at age sixteen due to car accident.   

    1894.        Christy B NDE       4/25/2009.      NDE 3964.             I was with my biological mother who passed twelve years earlier and countless others who loved me and were so happy to see me and I them. I felt as though they were caring for me but I didn't understand why.  I was told that it was to keep me safe and that I would have to leave soon.  I didn't want to go because I felt like I was Home!  I felt a very powerful, all-loving, and content sensation.  I was surrounded with a powerful energy source.  I was a source of positive energy myself.  
   NDE due to accident while passenger on a motorcycle.   

    1893.        Gloria NDE       4/25/2009.      NDE 3962.             I felt as though I was hovering around my body, but this was probably due to the drugs. I had no physical sensation even though I was crashing into walls and doors. I watched my body bouncing around. Two days later, after everything was over, I found contusions on my head and other parts of my body. In the meantime, somehow we made it to the hospital where they put me on a gurney, got me into a room, shoving a tube up my nose and down my throat (that I remember! - it felt like someone punched me straight in the nose). The hospital staff kept yelling for me to stay awake. I watched them from around my body more than in it.  
   NDE due to suicide attempt with unknown medications at age twelve. Remarkable anxiety in her mother at the time, which probably saved her life. Also describes a deathbed vision by mother.   

    1892.        Jodi S NDE       4/25/2009.      NDE 3961.             I remember seeing a bright beautiful light that started out in front of me and quickly was all around me. It was so intensely bright and white, but it did not hurt my eyes or make me squint. It was so bright white it had almost a blue hue to it. There is nothing on Earth I can compare it to, so it is very difficult for me to explain. But it was the most welcoming and beautiful feeling I ever had. I felt so incredibly free and I was intensely happy and felt no need for anything. There was no sense of time during this period. I just knew I never wanted to leave this sense of peace and wellbeing. One thing is for sure, I was NOT dead! I was more alive than I had ever been before.  
   NDE due to car accident.   

    1891.        Wilma J NDE       4/25/2009.      NDE 3959.             I saw a glow of light and a hand reach out to me. I grabbed the hand and was pulled to the other side where I was greeted with the most handsome spirit who guided me through this experience. I was told it was not my time but that God wanted me to know to start taking my life more seriously or I would be dead soon. I was told I have to come back and take care of my kids. I was told to be more understanding toward my mother. I also was told he would always be there for me. I cried because I did not want to come back here because I felt so much peace and calmness and love that I never felt before. It was really beautiful and dying to me is something I do not fear anymore or feel negative towards.  
   NDE due to medication complication after childbirth.   

    1890.        Thomas M NDE       4/25/2009.      NDE 3958.             I was shown many things, many realms, and many, many spirits of people and other beings. It was magic. This is the hardest part to communicate, as this part of the experience was wordless but filled with imagery that cannot be communicated. I honestly feel such things are not for this world and can never properly be explained or explored in this world. Like a child hoping for the perfect Christmas present, has many images in his head but until Christmas morning, he can never be quite sure what it will be. Until it is our time, I feel that the answers we seek will never be entirely revealed, which forces us to have faith, which forces us to change.  
   NDE due to car accident. Had amnesia for weeks after accident, then remembered the accident and the NDE.   

    1889.        Crystal B NDE       4/25/2009.      NDE 3957.             Then I remember seeing people in the past, like my father. When I was face to face to my father, I felt afraid. 'Did you steal this?' he said to me. 'No!' I replied, and then he asked it again, about ten times with the same movement as if it was rewound and replayed. When I told the truth I have to go on to the next person, I lied to. 'Did you do this to this?' 'No!' Then, when I had lied again, I ended up all the way back to my father. I had to tell the truth no matter how much crap I thought I would be in. I wanted it to end and I wanted it to fast forward so I chose to tell the truth throughout to all of the people I have lied to.  
   NDE due to car crash. Contains some atypical features. Remarkably, this NDE is shared only a few days after it occurred.   

    1888.        Patricia AR NDE       4/25/2009.      NDE 3956.             I looked to my right and saw the doctor beating on my chest, but I all I could do was stand there until I saw a light on the wall. It looked like a flashlight that grew bigger and I touched it and was taken into a tunnel with clouds spinning and rolling around. They clouds were grey, white, and smoky somewhat. I was gliding very fast with my arms just dangling. When I got to the end, the light turned orange and there was very tall man dressed in a tan work outfit (shirt and pants). I looked passed him and I could see yellow flowers and a large mountain and a blue sky. His face was the color of light sand and his hair was golden tan color. He had the kindest look in his eyes.  
   Two NDEs during surgery due to apparent cardiac arrest. The second NDE appears to include the rare situation of seeing a person during the NDE who was alive at the time of the NDE.   

    1887.        Richard R NDE       4/25/2009.      NDE 3955.             All of a sudden, I was in the most beautiful place. The sky was so blue. The weather was so perfect. I was outside. It was just this huge big open lawn. Every member of my family and friends who had died was there, even my dogs. I felt calmer than at any time in my life. I have never felt so at peace or happy. Then my brother came over to me, hugged me, smiled, and said it wasn't my time yet and then all of a sudden I was awake and gasping for breath and surrounded by a whole lot of doctors and nurses.  
   NDE due to respiratory arrest.   

    1886.        S. Jayashree S. Probable NDE       4/25/2009.      Probable NDE 3952.       From India.      There was a white bright light, very chilly weather - I lost my consciousness. My body felt very, very, very light and I had a flying experience. The speed you cannot describe in words, there is no stop for a moment. I traveled in a black tunnel with great speed. I had forgotten everything in this world - even my name, husband, and son, home where I reside and time, day, month, and year - nothing is there in my mind. The speed really threatened a lot and a sudden skip and jerk got me back in this world again. After this experience, I become a different personality with no interest in anything in this world. Even now I remain disinterested in life.  
   Probable NDE that happened after surgery.   

    1885.        Simran W NDE       4/24/2009.      NDE 4966/3951.       From India.      I saw that the bus I was travelling on had been involved in a terrible accident, killing the bus driver and injuring many of us passengers. I was the only one who was flung from a front seat. My vision was blurred and the sound around me was dull. A man asked me if I wanted to inform a member of my family. I struggled to answer, but managed to give my husband’s name. Then I saw my blood soaked body covered with splinters. My leg was crushed badly. I fell unconscious.  
   From India- relatively rare non-Western NDE.  NDE due to bus crash.  I believe the term used above is Vipissanâ, which in the Buddhist tradition means insight into the nature of reality. A regular practitioner of Vipassana is known as a Vipassi (vipasya).   

    1884.        JennZ NDE       4/24/2009.      NDE 3948.             I remember not feeling anything after that. I do remember a dream or visual experience. I remember moving rapidly through the trees and bright sunlight was shining through the trees, as I was moving toward something. Then I stopped. There was a big white house sitting under a brilliantly blue sky and there was a nice flower garden and white sheets blowing in the breeze on laundry lines. I remember looking into what I thought was a laundry basket on the ground but when I looked inside of it, I saw a baby.  
   NDE at time she passed out while driving.   

    1883.        Mandip Possible NDE       4/24/2009.      Possible NDE 3947.       From India.      There were doors sliding in front of me each door representing a stage of my past life since childhood and one door representing the present day. Somehow, I knew I had to enter the right door in the limited time I had, as after that all the doors would close never to open again leaving me all alone in the dark void forever. I also knew that if I entered the wrong door the memories from that stage of my life until today would be erased. I started fearing, not death, but isolation or never being able to see my two sons and husband again or even not recognizing them after I wake up. I felt time is slipping out of my hands and I decided that I'd rather enter the wrong door than stay back. In my head, I just thought of GOD and put my foot forward to enter the speeding doors.  
   Possible NDE from India.   

    1882.        Julianna D NDE       4/4/2009.      NDE 3945.             Was I really going to leave my life behind? I went over everything one more time and I just said do it now or else you'll suffer more with your life and if this ever came up again I probably wouldn't be brave enough to actually hold a knife to my stomach and say this is it. I'm through. So I lifted the knife up and just slammed it through my skin. The pain was so terrible I couldn't even cry. I remember falling on the ground with my mouth just hanging wide open. Then a white light appeared and a girl about sixteen or seventeen walked out. She walked up to me and wrapped her arms around my shoulders and told me that everything was going to be alright. I was scared. I kept on asking her who she was she just told me that it didn't matter and that she was my comforter.  
   Stunning NDE from suicide attempt at age 11.  Experience shared at age 12.   

    1881.        Phillip NDE       11/1/2008.      NDE 22021.             I was crossing a four lane highway. The cars by my side of the road had stopped at a red light that was half a block down. I went between the cars on my side and ran thru them thinking that the other lanes where clear because of the red light. I heard the screeching of tires, felt a heavy bump, and felt myself spinning thru the air. I then slid to a stop with my head on the curb and my body in the street. I was looking up at the sky. I could not hear, I was not feeling anything, and I could not move. The edges of my vision were getting closer and closer until finally I blacked out. All of a sudden I was high in the sky. I could see my body lying in the street. All the people were getting out of their cars. I had a panorama view of the whole area and I was slowly going higher. I saw the ambulance coming. I saw the paramedics get out. They started immediately cutting off my jacket and shirts, It was winter time. They hooked me up to a defibrillator and shocked me twice.  
   NDE at age 15 due to being struck by a car.   

    1880.        Isaac L NDE       11/1/2008.      NDE 22019.             I took two floaters into the water and was straddling them as I floated, while my mother and uncle sat on the concrete and talked. I floated, without realizing it, into the deep end of the pool. Suddenly, I slipped between the wet noodles and fell into the water. Being completely inexperienced in swimming, I sunk straight to the bottom and started inhaling water quickly. I saw a light, and started to thrash and walk toward it. I seemed to move unnaturally slowly and fluidly. I thought the light was a light at the edge of the pool, and I was planning to reach it and pull myself up and out of the water. I almost reached it when my uncle's strong arms gripped me and pulled me up. He had jumped in, in his business suit, to save me. When I talked to my mom much later, she said I hadn't moved from where I had fallen in the water - my conclusion is that my spirit left my body and was moving to the next life.  
   NDE at about age 6 due to near drowning.   

    1879.        Lydia L NDE       4/6/2009.      NDE 3949.       From Canada. Original in French translated to English by Simon A.      In the space of five seconds, I saw my life passing before me, and my grandmother, who was near to me. When I opened my eyes, I was under my bike, unable to move.  
   Teenager hit by a car at age fifteen and reported it at age sixteen.   

    1878.        Chris W Probable NDE       4/4/2009.      Probable NDE 3944.             Then the next thing I remember was that I was moving in slow motion across an open field of green grass. It was a sunny day - a bright and sunny day. (Remember I was on my way to work at 3:30 am in the morning. It was pitch dark and no grass.) As I was driving through the field, all of a tree was right in front of me. I swerved to miss it. Then I was just there watching myself, bent over holding my stomach, asking for help softly. Then from there I was in a man's house, blood all over me, sitting on his chair, saying only, 'Help, I hurt.' Then from there, all I remember was being in the hospital.  
   Probable NDE from car accident.   

    1877.        GP FDE       4/4/2009.      FDE 3942.       From India.      I felt that I was immersed in the heavy bright light while falling and remained there only until I got consciousness. Only light and oneness with all or none-ness with any prevailed with my thought. The body feeling or physical feeling was not there. When I came to this world again, only the pains and other related physical thoughts came to me. I felt some stillness during the course of accident until awakening on the hospital bed.  
   Experience began while falling, apparently prior to life-threatening impact.   

    1876.        Kumar NDE       4/4/2009.      NDE 3941.       From India.      At that point, I gave up but strangely, I was not at all sad. I accepted it almost, lay back feeling satisfied with a feeling of a lot of peace and calm around me. I felt happy that the doctors had failed to fit the puzzle piece. Then suddenly I felt a gush of cold air filling my body which may have been the ventilator starting.  
   NDE due to complications of childbirth.   

    1875.        Lisa L NDE       4/4/2009.      NDE 3940.             I heard a voice saying, 'Look up.' When I looked up, it was bright.  I looked back down, and then back up again.  I could see my soul leaving my body and going into the air. Right then I began to pray to God to let me live because I wasn't ready to go. I just had a baby in May and had three other small children.  They needed me and I needed them. As I prayed to God I watched my soul come back in my body and it was back in there before the ambulance got there, and next thing I knew I was in the hospital.  
   NDE due to injury.   

    1874.        Barbara W NDE       11/1/2009 & 4/4/2009.      NDE 4183/3939.             I had suffered a bleed from a cerebral aneurysm and was in hospital, in intensive care. At some point while there, I was travelling, following a very bright light. This presence was communicating with me, telling me not to be afraid and that I would no longer have any worries or cares. We were in a green field, filled with beautiful flowers, a tree and a brook. We arrived at a small white bridge that went over the brook and I was ready to cross it but the presence stopped me and said, ‘You can cross the creek, but you have three small children on this side’. I chose not to cross so that I could be with my children.  
   NDE due to cerebral hemorrhage.   

    1873.        Christopher G NDE       4/4/2009.      NDE 3938.             Even under the sedation I felt a small amount of pain but when my heart starting going into ventricular tachycardia a peace came over me. I became fully aware of my surroundings I could feel the shell of my body and my spirit began to rise; an extreme peace came over me. As my spirit began to rise the doctor shocked me and then again and my spirit stopped and went back into my body and my state of mind went back to being sedated. I felt complete peace no worries about anything and it was one of the greatest experiences of my life.  
   NDE during cardiac procedure while under conscious sedation anesthesia.  Interesting contrast between consciousness under this type of anesthesia and enhanced consciousness of NDE.  This experience was shared a few days after it happened.   

    1872.        Mitzi M NDE       3/14/2009.      NDE 3935.             Then everything went black and I totally relaxed. It was a very, very peaceful, calm feeling. There was no pain, no stress, and no worries. The next thing I remember was I was standing at the door of a very dark space looking out at a beautiful fall day. There was a dirt road leading off into the distance and I was at the beginning of it. There was a forest on either side of the road and the trees and plants were all bright colors of autumn.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    1871.        Greg D NDE       3/14/2009.      NDE 3934.             It was as though I was watching a video of my life - starting out slowly and increasing in speed toward the end. Then all of a sudden, it felt as though I was standing in the middle of a football field in total darkness. It was a feeling of open space for at least a few hundred feet around me. As I looked upward, I could see a rim of light at the very top of where I was. Air brushed behind my neck and I thought someone was behind me. I heard a voice coming toward me. A man's voice was in a different language. It was more of a whisper that turned into English, telling me 'It's almost time.'  
   NDE due to asthma attack.   

    1870.        Marci F FDE       3/14/2009.      FDE 3933.             I saw my life pass in front of me and at that same moment, something intervened to redirect my car and I glided safely to the other side.  
   From France.  Life review at time car slid on an icy bridge.   

    1869.        Cedric G NDE       3/11/2009.      NDE 3926.       From France, translated to English by Amy.      When my heart rate reach two hundred and eighty beats per minute the doctor turned to me and asked if I was okay. I remember it was precisely at that moment that I felt that I was going to faint. I therefore responded, 'Not really,' and 'let go'. That's when I climbed slowly towards the ceiling, my vision was tunnel vision, pretty clear in the center and blurry on the sides, I climb for a few seconds, I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything, I understand that I am going up and then am violently pulled back down. That's the only thing I feel for real, the ceiling gets farther away and the descent to the bottom is at an unnatural speed. Once I'm out of that room I regain consciousness, a nurse realizes that my entire body is trembling.  
   NDE from cardiac arrest during a procedure.   

    1868.        Cherie M NDE       3/7/2009.      NDE 3931.             All of the sudden there was a dark tunnel. I was being sucked through towards the light. When I got to the light, there was Jesus. It wasn't visual but there was no disputing who it was. He took me by the hand. The profoundly incredible peace was beyond conception. We walked hand and hand for some time. It was hard to tell because it was like there was no sense of time. I remember feeling the presence of my deceased father in the distance. I also remember not wanting to come back. It was bliss. Jesus told me only he has to choose and it wasn't time for me.  
   NDE due to being shot in head at point blank range.   

    1867.        Julie D Probable NDE       3/7/2009.      Probable NDE 3929.             I was standing in the ocean. I could feel the pull of the undertow. I knew nothing about undertow. I sat down in the water. The undertow pulled me out into the ocean and flipped me all around. I felt a deep sense of peace and a feeling that I was going to drown. There was no panic only peace. I thought to myself, 'I wonder how far this has taken me out into the ocean?' I also thought calmly, 'I am going to drown.' I also had a panoramic view of my life - there was no sense of time - I didn't know how long this was all taking. There was some sense of God being in control of the situation; however, I did not specifically see any Being. Then, suddenly, I was 'let go' and I came to the top of the water. I was not far from shore. I was with a friend. She was on shore laughing at me. She said it looked 'funny'. I never told her (or anyone else) for a long time I did not know this was an 'NDE'. Years later, I heard someone on TV describe exactly what happened to me. They had been in a near drowning experience as well.  
   Probable NDE due to near drowning.   

    1866.        V NDE       3/7/2009.      NDE 3928.             Then, I was Home. Earth and this life were a bad summer camp, in comparison, and I knew I wanted to stay. I didn't want to go back to camp. That's all I knew. I didn't 'see 'God,' but I felt as though I was sitting in the lap and wrapped in the arms of the most wonderful, loving (giant) 'parent'. This is where it gets frustrating, because there are not, now, and will never be words to convey how this feels.  
   Profound NDE at age three due to overdose of unknown medication.   

    1865.        Leta NDE       2/28/2009.      NDE 3923.             I woke up at 4:00 am. I went into the bathroom. I started to feel queasy. I felt faint. The next thing I remember was I was FLYING, super-fast, head first down a long, dark hallway. It was very dark. There was someone on my right holding my arm taking me. I could tell that this person KNEW where we were going and it was their mission to bring me. I was screaming no, no, no. I did not want to go. I could see objects going by me on each side. I don't know what they were because we were flying so fast. It felt like we were going down that dark hallway for a long time. I remember just thinking no, where am I? Where are we going? Then we stopped in front of a door on the left. I don't know what color the door was, all I knew was it was a door and I was not going through it! I kept saying NO! The next thing I remember was my husband telling me I had a seizure.  
   NDE due to seizure followed by respiratory and cardiac arrest.   

    1864.        Linda S NDE       2/28/2009.      NDE 3922.             I saw my sister, who had passed away twenty-one years before my experience. She was doing some type of work with other beings, who had human form, but I do not remember their faces. This was in a one-level structure that looked like a long house from the outside. She was giggling and quite happy. She greeted me and told me there was someone she wanted me to meet. Amidst some commotion, through the back came Jesus Christ, and there was no mistake as to who he was. He looked like the artist's portraits, but not meek and mild, as often portrayed, he was healthy and robust. He put his arm around me, in the area of what would have been my shoulder, looked me straight in the eyes and said, 'I have come for you, that you may know that I am real.' I was totally awestruck by His presence, yet I felt a love and respect for Him that I have never felt in physical life. I followed Him to an area that I can best describe as a 'desert garden'. We sat on large 'sitting rocks', and he began to speak.  
   NDE during coma due to bacterial meningitis.   

    1863.        Valerie R NDE       2/28/2009.      NDE 3921.             Sometime during surgery I went through a tunnel, parts of my life passed me by, I had closed my eyes tight, I remember someone saying open your eyes. I was in a pure white space, and could see rooms with spirits walking around; I started to cry, but no tears. I remember looking at my hands and they were translucent, then an angel appeared, she had such a radiant glow to her beauty to behold, she comforted me, telling me I was safe. I remember telling her I wasn't ready to die. She said she knew that, then she pointed down, and I could see the doctors doing CPR on a little girl. Not really understanding that was me, I watched my whole operation, CPR, and all.  
   NDE during surgery at age seventeen.   

    1862.        Adaline C NDE       2/28/2009.      NDE 3920.             I then was in this beautiful glowing place, white glowing background like clouds but illuminating bright clouds, and a man in front of me.  There was a man in a white dressy shirt and white dressy pants, his hair so smooth black and short, beautifully combed to the back (very good-looking man). I was begging him to let me stay, but he insisted in telling me I have to go back. I insisted that I did not want to come back; I wanted to stay in this beautiful place.  
   NDE due to strangulation by ex-boyfriend.   

    1861.        Catherine D NDE       2/27/2009.      NDE 3916.       From France. Original in French, translated to English by Jean Peter.      At the end of this tunnel, I saw this beautiful, extremely attractive light, and to which I came closer very fast. It is very hard to describe this light. The light I saw does not exist on Earth. I would say LIGHT AND EVEN SHADOW might (?) look like what nuclear physics can produce: light is made of small ultra-bright dots, hyper-mobiles and DENSE, energy. Colors are very, very vivid, clear, as if PURE, and each light dot that makes up the light seems to be individual, but it participates to the whole that constitutes the light, and it seems to contain the whole color prism. As for the field of view, it encompasses all.  
   NDEr met God.   

    1860.        Cora V NDE       2/23/2009.      NDE 3865.       From the Netherlands. Original in Dutch, translated to English by Annelies.      In the distance, I saw a glowing point light up. While I was watching it became bigger, like the sun rising and it came through the closed window into the room and embraced me completely. Then all went quiet inside me. All I felt was a warm love, peace, and a feeling of happiness that is difficult to put into words.  
   Beginnings of a NDE.   

    1859.        Mark NDE       2/22/2009.      NDE 3919.             I sensed Angels gathering around me; it was peaceful. Then, I was maybe twenty to thirty feet above the pool, looking down at my friend diving into the pool to save me. The Angels took me up to a gathering of clouds. There were a few Romanesque pillars with green ivy, and an archway in the back. I had seven Angels holding me up and four in front of me on the landing. Three were very animated and discussing what to do with me, the fourth angel kept me company. I looked around and saw very large Pure Love Orbs with silhouettes of human souls - like a chalk outline of a dead body.  
   NDE due to drowning at age twelve.   

    1857.        Marissa G NDE       2/22/209.      NDE 3915.       From Isr'l      I saw a girl in the hospital bed and knew that she was very ill and dying. With this understanding, I knew it was me and that I was this ill girl.  I had departed from my physical body and was looking at my hospital room from the corner of the ceiling. I saw my father walking up and down looking now and then at the monitors that my body was attached to, I saw my mother sitting in a large armchair quietly. Then they appeared one on my left, one on my right and one behind me.  
   NDE due to illness.   

    1856.        Stefan B NDE       2/22/2009.      NDE 3918.             I was standing on a moving swing and fell down after a girl shook the swing (and I wasn't holding myself to anything). I fell on my back and hit my head on the ground. I immediately lost consciousness. Then I saw my life from the beginning like in a fast-forwarded movie (the feeling I got was that of a dream - compared to full consciousness - so I didn't actually realize that I was unconscious). I woke up before the memories could reach the present with a fade-to-black and then to the gray of the rainy sky of that day.  
   NDE at age eight in Romania due to falling from swing.   

    1856.        Georgia Possible NDE       2/22/2009.      Possible NDE 3917.       From Sweden. Original in Swedish, translated to English by John S.      I remember the meeting with the incredibly kind figure who wore a long cloak or mantle. I think it was a male figure, maybe an angel, but without visible wings. I clearly remember the question he asked me, 'Are you ready to cross over?' I knew somehow that there wasn't any return if I did that. I almost felt embarrassed and ungrateful to the friendly figure when I said, 'Mom and dad need me, besides we will go back to Sweden in a few days.'  
   Possible NDE from a Muslim originally from Turkey   

    1855.        Jolene NDE       2/22/2009.      NDE 3913.             The white, warm glow surrounds me. It is the purest white light you could ever see, glowing all around you. I felt so comfortable, and so undoubtedly happy. I knew what was going on, I knew it as a fact, not assuming. I was dead. It felt like a long time before I was spoken to. It was not verbally, nor did I see anyone/anything else around me. I was being spoken to from within my own heart. It is hard to describe without sounding like I am making a conversation with myself, but that's what it was. It was like my inner conscience was talking to me. It asked 'Are you ready to come home?' I knew it meant death. I thought about it, I really did, I thought so hard and for what seemed like hours, I contemplated. Do I really want to die? This was the greatest feeling I had ever experienced, do I want this feeling to end? My answer was 'no'.  
   NDE due to complications following open heart surgery at age four.   

    1854.        Krisna T NDE       2/15/2009.      NDE 3909.             I have no memory of the accident but what I do recall is floating outside my body. The backside of my body was to me. I felt something (what I know now was an angel) wrap around my arms and legs. I started being pulled back into my body when I was overwhelmed with the feeling of peace and calm.  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    1853.        Joelle L Possible NDE       2/15/2009.      Possible NDE 3911.             I remember being somewhere where it was very bright. There were others with me. I think like three or four others. We were in a group. There were others, I sensed them but I could not see them. The ones I saw are funny. It seemed like all I saw of them were heads and small wings. We communicated mentally only. I heard farther away someone saying, 'There is a body available, but you must act quick.' I said, 'I'll go.' But one of the others close to me said, 'No it's too soon for you.' I said. 'I don't care I want to go.' They said, 'You must go now or it will be too late.'  
   Possible NDE remembrance from birth.   

    1852.        Jacqui C NDE       2/15/2009.      NDE 3908.       From Australia.      I saw beings in the form of 'aliens' but these may have been guardian angels lifting me away from earth into this amazing bright light that was like a tunnel. I felt so much love and beauty. It was such a peaceful experience that I did not want to leave. I was given a choice as I was travelling down this tunnel to live or carry on through the tunnel. I was going through a negotiation as to what would happen if I died and how badly it would affect my mother, husband etc. I also saw my future, that I had not experienced having children yet and had a lot more things to accomplish. It was not my time.  
   NDE due to allergic reaction with respiratory arrest.   

    1851.        Tara V NDE       2/15/2009.      NDE 3907.             It was as if I was moving very fast and pictures where flashing in front of me one after another and so on. It was confusing. All of a sudden, I saw the brightest light but I don't remember seeing clearly just actual beings almost on another side. I felt this complete happiness and feeling of just everything was lifted and I was to go. I could hear people telling me I must go back. I think it could have been my grandfather. I didn't want to go back or even understand why I was supposed to go. The feeling was euphoric. All of a sudden, it was like I came out and popped out of a very bright bubble.  
   NDE due to being run over by car.   

    1850.        Gordon M NDE       2/15/2009.      NDE 3905.             I experienced the following, with complete clarity and comprehension.  Instantly, I was aware of every negative interaction with other human beings in my life. I knew if I remained where I was, I would feel and experience every harmful thing that I had caused others knowingly or not in my life.  It was very frightening because the collective emotional pain was overwhelming. I somehow sensed that I was given a choice to go back. I prayed sincerely for the first time in my life.  It was simple, I promised to be the best person I could be.  
   NDE due to being shot with shotgun.   

    1849.        Jeanne NDE       2/15/2009.      NDE 3899.       From Australia.      I was picking flowers for mum on the way home from school. The nicest ones grew on the edge. I bent over to pick them and fell. Down below was a stream and rugged rocks. No fear, I just thought, oh I am falling. Then nothing, just blackness, then I heard the noise and felt like I was being hurtled quickly through the darkness. Then came the big noise the huge crack like thunder, then the great big blinding light and bang it's like they shocked me to come back, it was not my time. I don't know how I survived with my face in the water or how long I was out. My arm was bust and I was badly bruised and suffering shock. Never forgot the light or the noise!  
   NDE at age six due to drowning.   

    1848.        D.I. FDE       2/15/2009.      FDE 3893.             I left work around 9:30 pm. It was raining steady but not hard. I was heading toward the interstate on-ramp that I always take to head home. I saw the on-ramp speed limit sign. As soon as I did, I turned my wheel to take the right turn. At which point my car went off the road to a wet grassy shoulder, with a line of trees dead ahead. As soon as my car left the road, everything seemed to slow down. I remember being able to think and figure out what do, figure out all the outcomes. I saw my wife as clear as day standing right before me.  
   Fear Death Experience from near auto crash.   

    1847.        Don M NDE       11/30/2012 & 2/15/2009 & 5/29/2005.      NDE 6494/3892/2230.       From Canada.      The tug was getting closer and, as Rick's head was going to get it, I couldn't let him go.  I squared my shoulders and thought that maybe I'd just break a shoulder.  Well, the tug just kept on coming, and I knew it had to stop soon, but by then I realized I couldn't get out if I tried.  At first, I thought my ribs were going to cave in and then I said goodbye to my family and I thought my head was going to pop off.  Then, a friend from back home in Glen was right beside me.  It was Bruce, and he said, 'It's okay.  Relax.  You're welcome.'  He was guiding me towards the most brilliant light and a roaring tunnel.  In my mind, I asked what was happening.  A voice came.  A male voice just matter-of-factly said, 'You are drowning.'  Instantly, I saw my mother and my two little sisters, Mary-Lou and Lorna, crying at the kitchen table.  I never want to see anybody like that again.  I yelled out 'No!' and, not knowing where I was, just started kicking.  
   NDE due to drowning.   

    1846.        Norma B NDE       2/15/2009.      NDE 3889.             At that moment, a great peace came over me. My head fell over to the right and down, and my consciousness (soul?) lifted to the right and up to the corner of the room, where I watched what was happening below. I thought about my two grown sons, neither of whom I had told about the surgery. It was an indifferent, wondering feeling to think how surprised they would be to learn I was dead. I watched as the two nurses near me suddenly realized there was a problem. 'Look at those splotches on her face!' 'She's not breathing!'  
   NDE due to respiratory arrest after surgery.   

    1845.        Vickie G NDE       10/19/2008.      NDE 21970.             I had not been aware that I was feeling dizzy or anything while I was standing off to the side of the exam. I felt perfectly normal.  The next thing I remember was that I saw myself crumpled onto the floor.  I was floating above my own body and the sensation was euphoric, it was a feeling of perfection in the highest form.  I was completely weightless and hovering over my own body in complete bliss.  I watched and listened suspended above my own body. At the same time, it was as though all questions of the universe had been answered in that one moment. The nurse exclaimed ‘Oh my gosh, doctor, what happened?’  The doctor turned as quickly as the nurse had and was checking me.  I could see my lifeless body lying there, the eyes were shut and the face was expressionless.  
   NDE due to faint in doctor’s office.   

    1844.        Laurie S NDE       2/11/2009.      NDE 3896.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated by Simon.      I said yes, and immediately lost consciousness, seeing images of my life like snapshots, from early childhood up to the age I was at that time, seeing and understanding the meaning of all these pictures, although they flashed by at remarkable speed. Sudde  
   NDE after going unconscious.   

    1843.        Silvan NDE       2/11/2009.      NDE 3900.       From Italy. Original in Italian, translated by Amy.      All of a sudden, I felt so peaceful. I felt in a way I never felt before.  There was a deep peace.  The body no longer existed and it was as though it had never existed.  It was like none of my memories ever existed, pain never existed, memory of pain, no recollection of anything.  I only felt serenity and a white light all around me.  The light was blinding, a light cold in tone but warm. I don't know if I can succeed in making you understand, it's as though you have your arms wide open on a summer's night and your eyes closed and you feel the synchronicity of everything.  
   NDE after going unconscious.   

    1842.        Isabelle M NDE       2/7/2009.      NDE 3891.       From France. Original in French, translated by Simon.      On either side of the tunnel were very bright images. I recognized myself, as a child. It was like a film. I kept going forward through the luminous tunnel, and it was very pleasant. The feeling I had was of infinite fulfillment. Then a moment came when I was brought up short by a 'wall' of dense light, which gave off an unbelievable goodness, an indescribable love. I heard a voice filled with tenderness say to me: 'It's not time, you must go back, it's much too soon.'  
   NDE after going unconscious.   

    1841.        Alida V NDE       2/7/2009.      NDE 3886.       From Switzerland. Original in Italian, translated by Amy.      ...there was someone close by, I can't say who it was, and I was fascinated by the 'sun' that I saw shining overhead, it drew me towards it, it was irresistible, I wanted to go to the 'sun' but someone telepathically told me I couldn't. I thought that I was awake and that my body was still in this world, so I stopped for a moment and wondered why the 'sun' attracted me so, and why I couldn't go towards it. But at the same time I knew 'I don't know how' that I wasn't allowed to go to the 'sun'. So I decided to disobey that voice inside of me that told me I couldn't because the attraction was really too great. Then in a fraction of a second as I was attempting to go towards that light I was projected into my body and I heard some people who were telling me to throw up the water.  
   Child NDE from near drowning.   

    1840.        Miriam P NDE       2/4/2009.      NDE 3846.       From Venezuela. Original in Spanish, translated by Amy.      I wanted to scream and tell them that I was still here but I couldn't open my eyes. It seemed as though there were fractions of a second in which I saw scenes of my life with my family, my children, my husband and my work colleagues and I asked myself why, since there was so much more for me to do, when the most beautiful music surrounded me and I resigned myself to staying. Then I saw my twenty-year-old son leaning against a wall. My sister-in-law was asking him how my husband was doing. He answered, 'He's better now.' Then I realized that hours had passed. I heard my other son. He was walking and they had already told him about my death. I was sad thinking about the pain that my death was causing everybody and I said to myself that I needed to go back, it wasn't fair even if the peace and serenity that I was feeling was so wonderful and unexplainable.  
   NDE from surgery complications and under anesthesia.   

    1839.        John S NDE       1/25/2009.      NDE 3876.       From Sweden      An infinite 'world' of angels stood inside there, millions, trillions of creatures. Everything and everyone was in this indescribable pure and beautiful light, like silver; yes, I simply cannot find words to describe that. The most remarkable of all and at the same time wonderful: it looked like all these angels were expecting me! The little me!  It was as if they showed me - or reminded me - what was waiting once for me, something felt in a very immediate form. At the same time, it appeared as if it they knew that my 'time' had not yet arrived.  
   NDE from a criminal attack.   

    1838.        Jason N NDE       1/25/2009.      NDE 3888.             I looked and there was a tunnel where he was, I looked at myself on the floor where I slept by my sister. I saw her sleeping in the bed. I looked back at him and took his hand. For some reason I trusted him. I had a feeling that he was a good person. We walked through the wall into a tunnel. There was a bright light and he stopped and told me to go through it. I remember stepping through and it became a bright sunny day. A beautiful place and children playing with lions and everyone was so happy. They all looked at me and told me to go meet them. There were two glowing figures.  
   NDE at age eight due to breathing cessation secondary to sleep apnea.   

    1837.        Taylor P NDE       1/25/2009.      NDE 3887.             Then G-d came to me. There were two angels on either side of me.  They were on each side of my shoulders behind me, and almost above my shoulders, but not where I could see. I only saw a glimmer of their light. Then G-d told me to breathe the water in like it was air. Instantly as I heard his voice, I had a calm and peace that cannot be experienced on earth. I did as he said without hesitation, and breathed in the water like it was air. I quit fighting and began to even out inside the water. I was no longer feet down and head up; I was level with the water. As I breathed the water in, it did not hurt at all. In fact, it felt just like breathing air. I would take the water in, and then expel it just as you do with air.  
   NDE at age eight or nine due to drowning.   

    1836.        Lauren H NDE       1/25/2009.      NDE 3885.             I remember seeing this VERY bright, yet not blinding light. I had the sensation of floating upward through darkness and past shadows that had no form. Then as I continued upward, I got to a point where I couldn't go any closer to the light - my loved ones were there and the kept telling me to go back, that it wasn't my time yet.  I wanted to stay. I felt love, peace, as if I were home. Then I felt like I made a decision. At that very moment I made my mind up, I was 'sucked' backwards into life. Back onto Earth. I woke up inside an ambulance. I do remember prior to waking hearing a man say, 'We lost her'. And then, when I came back, 'She's okay.'  
   NDE due to accident.   

    1835.        Brent L NDE       1/25/2009.      NDE 3884.             That afternoon I had pain in my back. This had been the sign for the need for angioplasty and stent placement before, so I knew what to do. While awake and on the operating table, my doctor was talking to me with his usual back and forth that occurs during an angioplasty when he suddenly yelled, 'Cough, Brent, cough!!!!' I managed to get one cough out and then I was rushing through a completely black hallway. As I moved, there were living photos of the same people I had dreamed about the night before. They were smiling and gesturing me to move ahead. I looked forward, not to see a light, but a large picture window of blue on the left side of the hallway. The most perfect blue was shining through and I worked my way so I could see the view. I was just turning to see out of the window as I approached and then my doctor's face was in mine saying, 'What did you see?'  
   NDE during angioplasty.   

    1834.        Carole NDE       1/25/2009.      NDE 3880.             I saw myself looking down at my own body and wondered 'what are they all scared for? Why is everyone running around?' I then felt the most amazing 'LOVE' imaginable. There was peace in my heart. I knew there was a wonderful place for me to go when I was done. There was a bright white light and I felt the most incredible love (peace, forgiveness, tranquility) ever. I knew I was dying and I wanted to go to the light. I was very disappointed when I heard a voice (and I knew it was a higher power) say, 'You are not finished yet. You cannot die. There is so much more you have to do.'  
   NDE due to asthma attack at age thirteen. Experiencer is a professor and a nurse.   

    1833.        Jay K NDE       1/17/2009.      NDE 3877.             I saw myself (from the ceiling area of the truck) lying on the floor of truck with materials from the passenger side of seat on my body. I was not wearing a seat belt because I always had a feeling something like this would happen, I even practiced what I called (the dive move) where I dove to passenger side of a vehicle practicing for this sort of accident. I was not hurt; I did not even end up with a scratch. It seemed like only seconds I saw myself lying on the floor of truck and I thought to myself (I am dead). Then I saw myself move on the truck floor and thought I am alive.  
   NDE due to truck accident.   

    1832.        Harley W NDE       1/9/2009.      NDE 3873.       From Canada.      During each episode, I floated above my body, rose up, went to the window, and looked out at a bright summer day. Then floated back to above my bed and overhead what the medical teams were doing to get me back to life. I thought I was dreaming but I could recite all the procedures by name and the medical teams were stunned because I never went to medical school obviously, so they could not explain it.  
   NDE at age seven due to head injury.   

    1831.        Cassandra K NDE       1/9/2009.      NDE 3872.             I was conscious and aware of myself and I was somewhere else, but it was dark and I couldn't see anything but I wasn't afraid. I was very much aware of the fact that I was not in my body anymore but I was okay, I remember thinking where am I? I was aware that I was still here, that my brain still worked even though I had no body and I was happy to know that this was possible. I knew in that moment that we will always exist, this was the predominate feeling I had, this awareness of my soul continuing without a body.  
   NDE due to accidental heroin overdose.   

    1830.        Kate B Possible NDE       1/9/2009.      Possible NDE 3871.             It was as if I went through a dimension, like a wall I popped through and then I was floating in the darkest space. There were bright stars all around. I thought - oh no, there's been a mistake, and I saw forms of hands and arms trying to reach me through this dimensional wall. They couldn't get me. I felt they were crying, 'Catch her, catch her'! I was floating through space and began to get very worried. I knew that this was the 'real me', and that my 'dream me' was having a surgery and that something wrong had happened.  
   Parotid surgery. No life-threatening event. OBE to space, felt she was with people she knew forever.   

    1829.        Patrick M NDE       1/9/2009.      NDE 3867.             For me it was a wakeup call, or more like a huge SMACK in the face, WAKE UP, quit living your life in the way I had been. And to become a better human being in all ways, my personal relationships, my professional relationships, etc., etc. IT TOTALLY changed me.  
   NDE due to electrocution (12,000 volts, 15 amps).   

    1828.        Chen M NDE       1/9/2009.      NDE 3866.       From China.      I didn't know how to describe him. He had no shape or voice, but he was bright and broadminded, warm and gentle. He could answer every question. He surrounded me and guided me. He communicated with me through telepathy. He revealed everything of the universe. I was no longer in the tunnel but I was in the bright warm world. I felt a complete relief from pain and suffering. I felt the existence of everlasting harmony and happiness. He told me everything that I wanted to know. He told me the world consisted of molecules and atoms and they keep moving. Then he showed me a tree that was beside my window in my room. What surprised me is that I had greatly improved my vision incredibly. I did see a world with moving molecules and atoms. The feeling was extraordinary and I felt my consciousness was much faster then ever before.  
   Very detailed NDE from China. Relatively rare non-Western NDE. From posted Internet account, translated by volunteer translator.   

    1827.        JMH NDE       1/2/2009.      NDE 3863.             I felt light and bodiless, and the peaceful being steered me to another place. It was light and awesome; I rested there for a long time, although really there was no sense of time. I guess I rested there until I felt like participating in conversation. I noticed I had no body, but felt perfectly warmed and there was a sense of love and peace rushing through me, like blood in veins - but I had no veins and nothing to 'feel' with. I started wondering where I was and looked outside my light pod. The pod had no inside or outside. For the sake of description, I will say pod, but I don't know what to call it. I saw others just exactly like me, and a great light pod in the center of all of us, millions of us, floating in the otherwise dark void with a pure golden light connecting each of us to the center pod. The golden thread of light was like an umbilical cord although it had no real form but just light, and it was delivering the peace and love of the center being.  
   NDE due to respiratory arrest secondary to illness (scleroderma).   

    1826.        Brenda W NDE       1/2/2009.      NDE 3862.             The Light is as others report. A warm bath of Light experienced as divine, as all knowing, complete Love, bliss. There was conversation without words and I understood I was to be sent back to live an abundant life. I begged not to.  
   NDE due to asthma attack at age seventeen.   

    1825.        Leslie B Possible NDE       1/2/2009.      Possible NDE 3860.             That night had the sensation I was falling very slowly, going around and around, through a dark tunnel. I had never been so at peace, I didn't want it to end. At some point, the thought passed through my mind, 'No, you must go back, you have three small children to raise.'  
   Possible NDE from infections of several organs.   

    1824.        Noelia NDE       1/1/2009.      NDE 3855.       from Spain. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Jenny.      I became aware of a beautiful light. The darkness became clear and there was light. I saw myself there on the ground in the arms of my friend and I could hear echoes of voices. I descended back into my body.  
   NDE from a sixteen year old who had an asthma attack.
