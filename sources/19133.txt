it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t quite ready to
resonate with me when you say that all
the petrol oil and corporations we
disappear I think they were just pulling
up their bike shop yeah so the questions
asked wouldn&#39;t some of these interests
that already have it that have a linear
systems that they can meter like oil and
gas and cold and what have you get
behind this and if they do have it in a
classified project begin to bring it out
the answer to that is I hope so in
probably yes because once it&#39;s a federal
complete in all likelihood they will
begin to bring it out but that but but
but that&#39;s but that&#39;s a good thing
but if the fundamental basic technology
is out there the science is out there
open source it would be able to go
through thousands of different
manufacturing entities that would want
to bring up iterations of it because it
would be patented
you wouldn&#39;t be infringing anything now
that that I think would be a very
wonderful development including the fact
that there may be corporate interest
that would come in out and say oh yeah
well we&#39;ve we have a better version of
this and act like they just invented it
they would never admit they had black
shelved it but they&#39;d be fine too the
main thing is to get the ball rolling in
the direction of bringing out these
solutions I don&#39;t think that the issue
of overcharging for it if it doesn&#39;t
have a lot of you know your iPhone costs
about sixty four dollars all in to make
including profits in Cupertino and staff
and executives and private jets and they
sell for seven hundred there&#39;s a massive
massive profit margin same thing with
all software systems a thousand percent
so but what would happen if there&#39;s no
IP there&#39;s no intellectual property
secrecy trade secret and patent around
it then people would be able to do
iterations of it that instead of costing
you know ten thousand dollars for one of
these generators maybe it costs two
thousand but it&#39;s running your entire
house which is you know less than one
year of your energy costs some
that are using oil or for this past
winter we&#39;re facing five to ten thousand
dollar oil bills and gas bills because
of the severity of the winter so I think
that when you look at this that is is
completely doable and if there&#39;s not
this sort of crazy secrecy or patent
issue around that if the price point is
going to be what it costs to manufacture
distribute and then some overhead and
what-have-you my goal is that if our
little operation at that star it&#39;s
called serious technology advanced
researches acronyms star is that
whatever if we were able to move this to
where we actually started providing it
to the public any revenue that would
coming in would go into gifting it to
very poor areas for example if you look
at equatorial equatorial rainforests
many of those villages and areas are
very poor if you said this thing costs
$5,000 you messed up say five billion
but they&#39;re chomping down the wood and
make charcoal to cook their chubby so
there&#39;s a huge amount of environmental
damage in areas where people would never
be able to afford to buy some
manufactured item and that&#39;s where a
sort of an enlightened sort of like
Newman&#39;s own salad dressing my view of
what we&#39;re doing would be like that
where we would then gifted or see that
in cooperation with other international
and local entities get these
technologies to areas to where there&#39;s a
huge amount of environmental damage and
where but they really couldn&#39;t afford to
just purchase a system like this for
their village or their energy needs and
that would be an amazing change and
what&#39;s happening right now in the
destruction that&#39;s going on not by large
corporations with by subsistence farming
and subsistence cooking and and energy
needs from just chopping down forests
and what-have-you so that&#39;s that&#39;s one
of my my goals if we got if we get that
far is that you know to have a
foundation part of what we&#39;re doing that
does that that provides these
technologies to areas that can&#39;t buy
them that are in need because it&#39;s
really about you know ultimately you
know I&#39;m an emergency doctor and I know
an emergency when I see one and it&#39;s an
act of compassion
say okay the world is in an emergency
but we need to do something to lift the
burden not only on Gaia but also our
fellow human beings and aren&#39;t doing as
well as we all are and and that&#39;s it&#39;s
an act of compassion and to do that and
that&#39;s that&#39;s really what gets me up
every day is the opportunity that that
might happen
