MEDICAL DIOGRAPIIY..
Dr. RICHARD BATIIunsT was a. native of Ja-
maica, and the son of an eminent planter in that
island, who, coming to settle in England, placed
bis son in London, in order to qualify him for the
practice of physic. In the course of his studies,
he became acquainted with Johnson, and was
greatly beloved by him for the pregnancy of hii
parts and the elegance of his manners. Besides
these, he possessed the qualities that were most
likely to recommend him in his profession; but,
B.5
lU
wanting friends, could make no way m tt. lie:
had just interest enough t:> be chosen physician to
an hospital that was supported hy precarious do-
nations, and \\hirh yielded him little or no rccom-
p('nce for his attendance, which, as it was only tt
few 1wurs on certain days in the week, left him,
in a great measure, master of his time. Of this
he was a good manager, employing it in the stu-
dies relative to his profession, and the improve-
ment of himself in polite literature. Iu conjunc-
tion with Johnson, Hawkesworth, and others, he
wrote " The Adventurer," a periodical paper that
will hereaflcr be spoken of, pursuing, at the same
t1me, the most prudent and probable methods
for acquiring reputation P..nd advancing himself in
his profession; but, missing of success, he em-
braced the otrer of an appointment of Physician
to the army that was sent on the expedition
against the llavannah, where, soon after his arri-
,·al, he was seized with a fever that then raged
among the troops, and which, before he could be
a witness of the reduction of the place, put n pe·
riod to an· innocent and useful· life.

tends to be Pope must think of nothing cls.c.

that character: he studied hard, dressed well, and
associ<lted with those who were likely to bring him
forward; but _h~ failed in his endeavours, and
shortly before his leaving England, confessed to .
Johnson, that in the cour~e of ten xears' exercise
o( his faculty, he had never opened his hand to !
more than one guinea.
The fa.ilure of such a person as those abo,·e •
mentioned, in a professi01~ in which \·ery many
ignorant wen hnse lJecn known to succeed,* was
matter of wonder to Johnson nnd all that knew
him. lie obeyed that prec·ept of ~cripture which
exhorts us to honour the Physician, and would
frequently say of lhuse of this country, that they
did more. good to mankind, '"ithout a prospect
of rewarrl, than any profe::;sion of men whatever.
lbtbur~t's want of encouragement afiected hin_1
much.: he often e.xpre~cd to rue his surprize,
that a young man of his end0wments and engag-
ing manners, should · succeed no better, and his
disappointment drew from l1im a reflection, which
he. has inserted in hi::; life of Akinside. '' lly an

Physicians." Such n book 1 should Lc glad to sec ;
and if any person hereafter shall be induced to
pursue Johnson's hint, he may possiWy think the
following remarks, which have occurred to me in
the course of a long intimacy with some of the
most enunent of the profession, not altogetHer
beneath his notice.
Of the Professors of medicine, in cttics re-
mote from London, nnd in country towns, I know
uut little ; but in the metropolis, 1 am able to
say, that in. my time, not only the track of a
young ' Physician was pretty plainly pointed out,
and it is curious to follo'v it, but that the con-
duct of such an one was reducible to a system.
.Mead was the son of a nonconforming minister;
the teacl1er of a. numerous congregation, who,
trusting to his influence OYer them,• brea his son
:1s a Physician, with what succe:>s is well kuown.t
* The intcrtst which the dissenting teachers had with the-
members of their several congregation!, though now but liuJe
J..nown1 was formerly very great, and in my memory was such,
tl-.;ot scarcely any member ofa separate congregation would dis·
pose of a d01ughter, or make a purchase, or advance a sum of
C'IQ!'ley on a mortgage, without first consulting his Pastor.
t I hnc heard it S3id, lhn when Mead t.egan to praclist1
}:c was a co11stant frequenter of the meeting at Stepney, wheu~
.t.J& father pre:~ched; and thal when he was sent for out of tbe
~sstiUbly, which he often was, his f.uher would1 in his prayer,

A ~I.CDOTES. 13
He raised the medical character to such a height
of dignity as was never seen in this or any other
country. His example was an inducement with
others of the dissenting ministers to make Physi-
cians of their sons. Oldfield, Clarke, Nes!Jitt,
Lobb, and l\Iunrkly, were the sons of dissenting
teachers, and they generally succeeded. The
hospital of St. Thomas, and that of Guy, in
Southwark, were both unJer the government of
dissenters and whigs; and as soon as any one be-
came Physician of either, his fortune was looked
upon as made. The mention of this circumstance
brings to my remembrance a contest, that, to a
degree, proves the truth of my assertion. Doctor,
afterwards Sir Edward, Hulse had been some
years Physician to St. Thoma$~S Hospital, and
being minded· to resign, nad set his eye upon Dr.
Joseph Letherland, a man of profound eru~ition,
for his successor. Hoadly, Bishop of Winchester,
had about that time a son, who having ·finishecl
his studies in physic at Cambridge, had taken hii
Doctor's degree, and was about to settle in Lon-
don. Hoadly was ever the idol of the Whigs :
he encouraged his son to offer himself, and the in-
terest was divided. Every nerve was strained,
tioged this to Johnson, .who said it was too gross for belief;
btit it was not so .=~t Bat~on's; it passed there as a current tra-
ditX>n,
14 1\ \"I:CDOT.CS.
and I Ioatlly lttisscd his election by fewer lLan ten

The same ad,·:.:mt:lge·at' ended the clcction of n
Pl1ysician to the llospit.als of llcthlchem nnd St.
Bartholomew, wl\ich arc of roynl foundation, and
ha.ve been under Tory Government. By cultiYnt-
ing n.n interest with either of tho two parties, the
succession of n.. young l?hys.icia.n was ulmost in-
sured. The frequenting llabmn's. or Child's was
n declaration of thttside he took, and his bnllincss
was to Le indiscriminately cmuteouR and obsequi-
ous to all men, to appear much abroad and in1
public places, to increase· his acquuintance. and
form g90d conut!xions; in the dOing wbereot~ a
,... It is rt>markable of this- penon, that upon this- f.ailure he
;Wandoned his profe!sion ; not so much, ~rh3ps, bt:cause of
his disappOintment, as of his pl'inciples. To a friend of mine
l1c confessed that he was, :~s to the effects of medicine, a
st-eptic; for lhat upun the principles of philosophy, he could-
not account for the operation of :my one medicine on the hu-
man body. He seemed, in this instance, to have adopted the
sentiments of Montaigne, who entertained the ume doubt,
and somewhere in his l!~says, describes a Pnys1cian puubg
;a pill into a patient's moulh, w~th.a commission to fuUow th~
cirl·ulation, and ac.t unly on that palt, the toe fOr instance, to
whi<:h it is directed. Of a different opinion was the father
of the person abov~ mentioned, Hoadly .Bilhop of Winchester,
when writing against the F1ee Thinkers, he put this sluewd
question : " \Verc all the mistakes and errors of Physicians

methods and exercising the patience of a setting-
dog for half a score years, in the expeatation of
deaths, resignations, or other accidents that occa~
sion vacancies, at the end thereof either found
himself an Ilospit~.l .Pbysician, and if of Bethle-
hem, a monopolist one, and that- a \·ery lucratiye
branch of practice ; or doomed to struggle with
difficulties for the remainder of his life.

commanded themseh·cs. to- practice by their writ-
ings; but in general, the methods of acquiring it,
I speak of the city, were such as are aboYe de·
scribed. O~e, and, only one, of the profession,
-.1:-. The medic.al character, whatever it is now, was hereto-
fore a grave one : it implies learning and sag<~cily ; and there-
fore, notwithstanding Lord Shaftesbury's remark, that gravity
is of the very essence of imposture, the eandidate3 for prac·
tice, ~hough ever so-young, found it necessary to add to their
endeavQur.'J a grav.e and solemn deportlllent, even to affecta-
tion. The Physicians in Hogarth's prints are not caricatures;
the full dress with a sword and a great ty~·whig, and the hat
w1der the arm, and the Doctors in consultation each smelling
to.a gold-headed,cane, shiJped like a P.CU"ish beadle's staff, are
pictures of real lif~ in his time, and myself have seen a young
l'hysician thus equipped, walk the Etreets of London without

This pcnwn was Dr. )h·ycr ~chomuerg, a na-
tive of Cologne, who ueiJ1g a Jew, as. I have
heard related of him, librarian to some person of
tl.istinction abroad, left that occupation, and came
:utd settled in Londou. Being of no profession,
and basing the means of a livelihood to seck, he
was at a pause, but at length detC'nnined on one,
and took it up in a mauner that will be best de-
scribed hy his own words to a friend of mine.
" I said I was a Physician." Having thus as-
sumed a profession, he cullivatt.!d an intimacy
with the Jews of Duke's Place; and uy their
means, got introduced to the acquaintance of
some of the leading mrn, merchants and others
ef that religion, who employed him, and uy their
interest recommended him to a practice, that in
.a few years, amounted, as he once told me him- ,
self. to a thousand pounds a year. 1Ie. was a man
of iminuating address, and as he understood man-
kind very well, having renounced the ritual dis-
tinctions of his religion1
he soon found out a
method of acquiring popularity, which had never
'Lrcn pructi::~ed by o.ny of his profcs~ion; he took
~ large bouse in the city, nml kept a public
.-\XECDOTI.S.. 17
table, to which, on a certain day m the week,
all the young surgeons were present, and treated
with an indiscriminate civility that bad very
much the appearance of friendship, but meant no-
t_bing more than that they should recommend him
tlJ practice. The scheme succeeded ; in the year
1740, Schomberg bad outstripped all the city
physicians, and was in the annual receipt of four
thousand pow1ds.
To enable him to practice, he had at his setting
out, procured himself to be admitted a Licentiate
pf the College; but that -permission bad been
gJlnted him with so ill a grace, or was followed by
some circumstances that provoked his resentment
so highly, that he seemed resoh·ed on a perpetual
enmity against the members of that body; who,..
on. their part, looking on him ao; little better than
a foreign mountebank, declined, as much as pos-
sible, meeting him in consultation, and thereby,
for some time, checked his practice-.
lie had a son, whom he brought up to his own
profession, who took it into his head, that ha\ ing
heen admitted a Licentiate, he was virtually a
Fellow, and claimed to be admitted as such: his
father encouraged him, and instituted a process
in his behalf, of which there had Leen no prece-
cl~nt since the time that Jefferies was Chancellor.

v:hirh, by then· arbitrary procec(ling, the Prcsi-

at Lincoln's-Inn Hall, before the Lord Chief Jus-
tice \\'illes, the Lord Chief ilaron Smythe, and
Sir Jolm Eardly Willmot, Lords Commissioners of
the Great s~al ; but the allegations therein con-
tained not being sufficiently supported, the same
was dism;ssed; it was, nevertheless, looked on as
the most forn1idable attaek on the College it had
ever sustained, nnd may be Si.tid to have shaken
its constitutiou to the very centre.
Political associations and religious sects arc ex-
cellent nurses to young mc>n of profes~ions, es-pe-

and Friend owed their fortunes to the iupport of
the Tories and Jacobites; 1\Iead and IIulse to the
"'bigs, and Srhomberg to the Jews. The Quakers
also, no £ontemptil}lc body of men, had power
and interest sufficient to introduce into great prac-
tice one of their own denomination; this was John
Fothergill', a yollng man of parts and industry,
who bcin3 bred ah Apothecary, and having ob·

taincd a Scotch Degree, settled m Lonuon, and
attached himself to Schomberg, taking him in
many p~rts of his conduct for his exampler: so
that, upon Schomuerg's decease, he slid into his
practice, and lJecame one of the most popukr of
the city Physicians. These two persons, first one
and then the other, for full tsirty years, carried·
all before them; and within that space of time,
not fewer than twenty of the profession, whom I
could name, lin~d in great straits, some of them
leaving at their decease scarcely sufficient to bury
them. From these, and many other instances
that m1ght be produced, it is (;v"ident, that nei-
ther learning, parts, or skill, nor even all tl1ese
united, are sufficient to ensure success in the pro-
fession I am speaking of; and that, mthmtt the
concurrence of adventitious circumstances, which.

brought about by any coucc:ssions of his adver-

1hat he got by it was, the character of an iras-

genius and parts, were shy of becoming his inti-
mates. Yet, where there "·as no competition for
applause or literature reputation, he was an easy
companion, and would bear with such rudeness as
would have almost angered any one. 5axby, of

ancients endeavoured to make it a science and fail-

good part, and joiue~ in the laugh which it occa-

The value of that precept which exhorts us to
li,-e peaceably with all men, or in other words to
avoid creating enemies, can only be estimated by
the reflection on those many amiable qualities
against which the neglect of it will preponderate.
Akenside was a man of religion and strict virtue,
a philosopher, a scholar, and a fine ~oet. His
conversation was of the most delightful kind;
learned, instructive, and, without any affectation
of wit, cheerful anJ entertaining. One of the
pleasantest days of my life I passed with him,

the enlivening sunshine of a summer's day, and
the view of an unclouded sky, were the least of

to exp~rience, who, in a competition for the place
of Physician to the Charterhouse, was unabie to
prevail aga.insi an obscure man, devoid of every
quality that might sen-e to recommend him, and
whose sole merit was that of being distantly re-
lated to the late Lord Holland.
To those persons who have been disappointed
in their hopes of success in the medical protession,
may be added one, to whom his failure was so
far from being a misfortune, that it was the means
of placing him in a station where only his worth
could be known, and of exaltirig him to dignities
in which he rendered more service to m2.nkind,
than lH• could han done in any other capacity
wbatenr. This was Dr. Seeker, the late Arch-
bishop of CantcrLury; of whom I shall relate a
few particulars not generally known.
""e are told by the reverend authors of his life,
prefixt>cl to his ~ermons published by them, that
he had been destined by his father for orders
among the Dissenters ; but that not being able to
t.h:cide on some abstruse speculative doctrines,
nor to determine absolutely what communion he
should embrace, he applied himself to the study
of physic. To this fact I add, that he was also
a candidate for practice, and that, in order to ou-
.-\ :-.:rr nurr.!).
tain it, he put on the garb uf a Plly:-i<'ian, and
fur a year, or for somewhat more, frequtntcu
Batsou's cofl'cc house in the city, but had uen:r
uny call from thence. Ilis biographers alJove
mentioned further say, that being recommeudccl
by l\lr. afterwards Bishop Butler, to l\Ir. Edwarrl
Talbot, a son of Bishop Talbot, that gentleman
promised, in case he chose to take orders in the
dmrth, to engage his father to proYidc for him,
and that, foreseeing many obst.Lrles in his pur-
suit of this profession, l\fr. Seeker, fur he had
not then obtained the degree of Doctor in his fa-
culty, embraced the offer. They add, that in the
summer of 1720, he was introduced to l\Ir. Tal-
bot, and that with him he cultivated a close ac-
quaintance. This, I conceive, was not till after
he had made the experic.1ent above mentioned,
-and determined on the change of his profes~ion.
1\Ir. Talbot's recommendation of his friend to his
f.1.ther succeeded; but he lived not to see the fruit
of it, tor in a few months after, he was seized
with the small-pox and died; which labt particu-

IN II."~,.EY's works, there is a case related of
so extraordinary a nature, that were it not gi' en
on the authority of that great man, it would
lum.lly obtain credit. As I nenr saw it quoted,
or beard of_any thing analogous, I shaH here
translate it.
" A noble youth, eldest son of Viscount ::\Iont·
gomery, in Irelanu, whibt yet a boy, had seve·
ral of the ribs of the left side severely fractured,
in consequence of a fall. A ~arbe. abscess super-
vened, whence great quantities of pus and sanies
were discharged for a long period ; as he himself
and others related to me. \\hen about the 18th .
year of hi!) age, after having tra' ellcd through
france and Italy, he came to London. There still
remained a large aperture in the thorax, through
which, as I was informed, the motion of the
lungs could be plainly discerned. This circum-
stance having been stated to our Serene King
Charles, as something extraordinary, I received a
command to examine the young man, and dis-
coyer, if possible, what was really the case.
On being introduced, I beheld a young man
apparently in full health, n.nd Legan to suspect
that some mistake. had occurred. Having, how~
ever, with all due respect, intimated to him his,
)lajesty's rc·quest, he readily exposed to me hiil

Hde ; removing, in the first place, a plate of ~il­

j ury from n blow. Instantly I beheld a large
caYity, ''"hich easily admitted three of my fingers
and my thumb; immediately on introducing them,
I felt a fleshy excrescence, agitated by recipr<r
,·al motions outwards and inwards, which I cau-
tiou!:ly laid hold of: surprised al the novelty of
the appearances, I carefully explored every cir-
cumstance. There appeared to be the remains
of au extensi\'e ulceration, ''"hich had healed in-
dependent of any medical aid, the whole being
t'ovcrcd with a membrane firmly agglutinated to
the margin of the ulcer. llut the fleshy excre-
srcnce, which I at first considered as a fungus
arising from the lungs, by applying one band to
it; and another to the wrist, and noting their
synrhronous motions, and observing, at the same
time, the motion of the lungs, I discovered to be
1n fact the- apex of the heart, defended, as it were,
from injury, by a tovt•ring of organized coagu-
lateu 1) mph. This cavity was regularly cleaned
out by the daily injection of some tepid fluid ;
after which, the plate was replaced by a servant,
when the young man was fit for any kind of
t>"Xrrcise, and experienccd no sort of inconvcni-
f'Uf<'.

By way of reply to his )!ajesty's request, I in-
troduced the young man to him, that be might see
with his own eyes, and feel with his own hand, this
very extraordinary phenomenon, of being able to
percei'"e tbe puh:ations of the bean, and even to
feel its '"ibrations, witboot occasiomng any incon-
venience to a man in perfect health. I a1so shew-
ed his .Majesty, that the heart was devoid of Een-
sation: for if the young ma.t1 did not perceh-e it,
and we carefully avoided touching the skin, the
patient was not sensible when his hem was
handled.
On carefully attending to the motions of the
heart, we obse%"'\"ed, that dunng the diastole, it
sunk inwards, and was retracted; but during the
systole, it emerged, and was protruded: and, by
applying the hand to the carpus, the stroke of
the arterv was found to coinci<!e v.-ith the s'-stole
~ -
of the heart; and finally, that during the systole,
which is the proper motion of the heart, it erects
itoself, becomes prominent, and strikes against
the canty of the thorax.- Gul. Harrei Opera

the science of Chemistry." He died at Dresden
in 1605. He left several works written in a style

CHE~IISTRY.
I rrAYE always entertained a doubt, whether
either mankind in general, or e.-en m~dical sci-
ence, has derived so much advantage from the
study of Chemistry as many persons imagine.
The discovery of gun-powder, by rendering wars
less murderous and sanguinary, has probably tend-
td to augment their frequency. The discoYery
of distilled spirits, considering to what extent they
are now used, has probably occal>ioned the deaths
of more persons than have ever uccn saved by
all the chemical remedies put together. Calomel,
in my time, appears to be employed to an extent
and with a freedom that must, in all prob;:.bility,

impair many constitutions, aud destroy numbers of
children. The study of C'hemi~:-ti·y tflo much su-
persedes that of the virtues of hcrlJs, by which very
many diseases may Lc cured. The early writers
prove, that C\Cn syphilis was curn·ntly cured
before the nse of mercmy was disrovcrcd. Che-
mical studies too much din'rt the mind from
attention to the animal o.·conomy. For my own
part, I ne,•er knew an expert Chemist who was
a good practical Physician.
Co~CEIT WILL KILL, CoxcErT WILL cunE.
A YOUXG sprig of Physic. apprenticed to a
country .Apothecary, after ha.Ying passed a few
years behmd the counter, had acquired sagacity
sufficient to pcn.:eive that hi::; master introduced
little Yariety into his prescriptions, but indisrri·
minately dispensed medicines nearly of the same
description to all his patients. Th1s uniformity,
the Tyro could not very well comprehend, and
humbly re,quested his master to vouchsafe him
some reason for his peculiar routine of practice.
lle was tuld, it was time enough to be acquainted
with the mysteries of the profession when the
term of his apprenticeship had expired.
The period of emancipat10n at length arrhed,
A:\ECDOT!.S. 4J
and the aspirant for medical honour and profit
required the completion of his master·~ promise.
'' l\ly worthy young friend," said the Esculapian
sage, " you ha,·e done your duty to me as a faith·
ful servant, and you will not find me an ungratl!·
ful master. Early in life (at least early in my
career of practice), I obsen·ed, that the admi-
nistration of powerful, and especially fashionable.
remedies, in place of removing the disease, often
removed the patient to another world. These oc·
currences distressed my conscience- Do not grin.
-I cannot reconcile myself to the habitual breach
of the sixth Commandment; I therefore deter·
mined to administer only simple and accredited
remedies, trusting to the salutary efforts of na-
ture, and soon fuund my practice no less success-
ful, and my conscience iutinitcly more tranquil..
'
My leading object has Lecn to impress my pa-
tients with a high opinion of my profound know-
led~e and personal sa~acity; for, in almost everi
di~ease, I early discovered the truth of the ol(f
adage, that Co"S"cr.IT WILL KII.L, and CoxcErr
WILL cuu.E. Do not trouble your head about
learnit1g, or inflame your eyes with study, my
boy; but follow my example and advice, and you
will do \try well."
Reflecting on this colloquy, Qt:nws began t()
11);'ECnon:s.
think that his apprentice fee and li.tborious non·
tiate were autant perdu; but he rcfolvetl, at lenst,
not to forget his master's last words and parting
advice.
lie went into the army as surgeon's mate; and
the war being over, having no better employment,
he attached himself to an itinerant German 4uack
of some notoriety, from whom he soon learned
enough to set up for himself in the same line.
After some years of lucrative circumforaneous
practice, he casually happened to revisit the
Yillage where he had served his apprenticeship.
Habit had rendered him eloquent, at least ver-
bose; and, while delivering his customary stage
harangue, he observed his ancient master among
the gaping crowd. " You think now," said he
to his auditors, " that I am a common mounte-
bank, a vulgar itinerant impostor. To prove to
you that I am not, 1 will engage to point out to
you, if you request it, :several of the aurlience
now present, who will not survive three days,
from this present time, except indeed they follow
my n<h·ice, and take my remedies, which, under
ProYidence, do sometimes seem to control the
decrees of Fate, and arrest the shafts of Death !"
~o one off<'ring himself as the ,·oluntary object of
this bold prognostic, the orator proceeded:-" For
ANECDOTI:S. 45
example, that fre5h-coloured good-looking little
man for his age, 'vith the nice powdered wig and
cocked hat, he looks as well and hearty as any of
us; but my art enables me to declare he will die
within three days, Wlless indeeJ he sends for me!''
The old gentleman, his former master, slipped
out of the crowd, repaired to his home, com-
plained of being very ill, and found it necessary
to retire to bed ; said he was sure he should die,
though he could not tell ,...hat ailed him. ..c\n old
friend happening to look in, endeaYoured to rally
him out of what he conceived to be an idle fancy;
but finding that impossible, he said he was sure
something lay upon his mind, which he begged
of him to <iivulge.
'Vith considerable reluctance, he at length con-
ft!ssed, that the prediction of the charlatan had
made an indelible impression on his mind, which
hecould not shake oft~ and felt quite certain heap-
proachfd his latter end. " "'by not send for the
fellow," says his friend; " he may be able to re~
move the impression of which he is the cause."
" I am ashamed," said the other; " what will
become of my professional character if I send for
a quack?" " Nonsense!" was the reply; " would
you sacrifice your life ~o a ridiculous punc-

C.ASTRATIO~.
O:sE. melancholy consequence of that state oi
mind which sometimes attacks men who find
themselves unable, by the force of reason, to
subdue unruly appetite~, is the mutilation of the
rebellious members. Although such instances,
happily for humanity, are not of very frequent
occurrence, they haYe been collected by some
Physicians as proofs to what lengths a disturbed
1magination may dri,-e tVen a healthy man, de-
termined to sacrifice nature to false notions of
religion. Thi~ passage of the Scripture, " There
A:-; r.cDorr~ .
~re solme men \\ ho have made th£ m:1eh es eunuch~
~
for the ~ake of the kingdom of heave~,'' being
misunderstood by Origen, determined him to
practice, according to the latter, this precept,
which is merely allegorical. :\or was he awar~·
of the turpitude of his conduct, uutil Deme..:

degraded, banished, and excommunicated by a
general council.
~lost of those who, from moth·es not less ab.:
surd than cruel, ha,·e followed this example, have
been the '\·ictirns of it. The Journal of ~Iedi·
cine for :\Iarch, 177S, furnishes two rern2.rkable
examples of it.-In 17(1, a young Lawyer, who
performed this operation upon himself, perished
in the course of a few hours. The law puni~bes
this description of suicide, as injurious to popu:.
latiun. Tb_e Parliament of Dijon, a few years
ago. caused a man to be banged, ".~:ho had thus
mutilated himself, to be revenged of his wife,
who was extremely jealous. This punisl:mcnt
was rather severe ; the criminal deserved mercy
rather than death.

PuvstLU.ss recomm~:nd an attention to Diet,
a~ one of the safest and most efficacious means of
curing di~eases; they recommend attention to it
enn in health, and doubtless they are right.
But do they not sometimes push this matter too
far? 1 have known some reduce their patients
to a state of incrediLle weakness, by almost iU:-
terdicting a~l nourishment, when that alone was
required to re-establish their strength, and to
difpell the remains of the disease by restoring
contractility to the .fibre, and animation to the
fluids. The same reproach may be made to the
Cbirurgeons, who put their wounded patients
upon the most severe diet, where the disease is·
local, and the stomach requires a certain degree
of stimulus to - promote dige.stion. 1 am per-
~uadcd, that many wounded men perish by ma-
rasmus and consumption, Lecnuse they are de-
prived of a due portion of nourishment. I rould
even produce some exn,mples, were this a proper
place.
I have somewhere read an assertion of a Phy-
sician, that by means of diet he could comert
in six weeks a bran man into a poltroot~. Grt:eu

of this principle, that he always employed the

they had joined him; while, to use his own expre~
sion, they still had a piece of beef in their stomach.
OwEs, the Poet, has the following Epigram
respecting Diet:

ports, and endeavours to confirm his opinion by
divers examples. :Manners must have changed
much since that period ; for it is not probable,
that a single surgeon rould, at the present day,
Lc found in Europe, barbarous enough to dis-
sect a living human being. Such dissecti(lns·
were certainly practised by the Physicians of anti~
quity, probably on criminals sentenced to death,
~s we find Celsus, in his preface, gravely repro-
hating the practice as cruel, barbarous, and horrid.
IT is well known, that in this country, persons

found guilty of murder, are sentenced to be
hanged, and their bodies to be afterwards dis-
sected. The intention of this law is to prevent the
crime of mur~er, by the terror of additional pu-
nishment and public disgrace. That it is not
always cons~dered as such, the following Jetter,
found among the pape,rs of a surgeon, lately de:-
ceased at Salisbury, proves:
Being informed that you are the only Sur-
geon in this county, in th: habit of dissecting
dead bodies-being very poor, I am desirous of
passing what remains to me of life with as much
comfort as my unhappy condition admits of. In
all probability I shall be executed in the course
of a month : having no friend to intercede for me,
nor even ~o afford me a morsel of bread to k~ep
body and soul together till the fatal moment ar:
rives, I beg you will favour me with a visit; I
am desirous of disposing of my body, which i~

miscd. '.augelas aflonlcd a proof of it uy his
last will. After having disposed of all his effects
to pay his d~bts, he adds, " llut as certain ere·

are disposed of; in that case, it is my last ,dll
that my body be sold to the Surgeons 011 the

be applied to the liquidation of those debts for
which I may be responsible to the public; so
that if I have not been able to render myself
useful to society during my life, I may be in
:>ome measure so after my ~eath."
A PEnso:s filling a high public situation at.
p,lris, a few years ago, left a similar legacy.
h is well known, that the late Dr..Monsey
expressly bequeathed his body for dissection; and
even left the operator a pecuniary gratuity for hii
trouble.

DI..:\RRHCE..\.
IT is generalJy understood, that the circum-
stance which chiefly incensed the conspirators
against Julius Ca?sar was, that on one occasion,
when the Senates came in a body to compliment
him, he did not rise ; but heard all they bad to
say sitting in his.chair. But all the world does
not know what prevented Ca?sar from rising ;
he, in fact, laboured under so violent a diarrhcea,
that had he attempted to stand upright, the con-
tents of his bowels would have passed from him
im-oluntarily. Such are frequently the causes of
the greatest events in the history of mankind.
To be convinced of this truth, it is only neces·
sary_to consult a wo'rk entitled, " Great Events
from Little Causes." The fact just mentioned
is taken from Dion Cassius.

may apply at all times with safe::ty; these are, a
cheerful tnind, moderate exercise, and a regu-
lated regimen. So said Dumoulin, the most
crlebratcd Physician of his time. Jn his last mo-
ments, being surrounded by s~veral of his col-
leagues, who deplored his loss, he addressed them
thus:-
· ~' Gentlemen, I leave behind me three
excellent Physicians." Each of the Dol'tors pre·
sent conceived himself to be one of the three i
but they were soon undeceived, when Dumoulin
informed them, that the three he meant were
Water, Exercise, and Regimen.
Dumoulin was fond of money, and he received
a great deal. 1\Iany anecootes are mentioned re-
specting this matter.-On leaving one of his pa...,
tients, who had made him a han.d_some payment
in coined money; as the amount was considera-
ble, he bad put it in his pocket. On retQrning
\lome, his first thought was to count the number
of pieces he had received. The attention he paid
to this reckoning prevented him from perceiving a
friend who was waiting for him in his apartment..
This person pleasantly said, " Allow me to hand
you a chair." Dumoulin looked at him with a
contemptuous sneer, sayin~, " Learn, Blockhead,
tbat a man never feels tired wh~n counting hi~
money."

A great love for this precious metal 'ili beneral-

In this rc!>pcct, Dumoulin yielded to nobody.
He was sent for one day to visit the Prince,

royal carriages, dri,·en by thft body coacbmau•

Sylva, who was naturally timid, was alarmed,
communicated his fears to :l\1. Dumoulin, saying,
" By what door shall we escape!' Dumoulin
having no ft'ar but that of not being paid, replied,
41
By the door where they pay;" and intrepidly
left the apartment, followed by Sylva, ·who trem-
bled. This constitutes a trait of character cquall-
td by the following :
A great CEconomist, not to say n miser, having
heard that Dumoulin far surpassed him in saving
knowledge, waited on him one winter evening,
about eight o'dock. 1Ie found him sitting in a
small room, illuminated, or rather darkened, by
the smokey light of a single lamp. On entering,
he said to him, " 1 have Leard that you are one
of the greatest ccconomists existing; I also am so
inclitied; but, conscious of my imperfection, I
~hould be happy to berome your pupil rcspectiug

" Be seated, Sir(' and in saying so, be extin-

DISEASE.
A~CIE~TL v, all diseases were attributed to
the Operations of Dremons, or evil spirits. Py-
thagoras, who believed the air to be replete with
spirits, according to Diogenes Lai:rtius, conceiT-
ed it \tas by their instrumentality that di£ease
was inflicted on man. In the Odystey, Homer
Mtributes the condition of a man labouring under
·a severe di!ease, to the int1u~nce of his evil ge-
nius. Celsus obser;es; that diseases were attribut-
ed to the wmth of the immortal Gods, and were
to be arrested by prayers and sacrifices. The
notion of atfribtiting diseases to e,·il genii still
prc,·ails extensh·Cly. The natives of America
stilt consider their diseases as innicted by God or
the Dc,·il, hy whom aloue tlicy can be cured. In
Russia, the common people attribute their maladies
to evil spirits, and employ a kind of conjurors to
'charm them away, which they ctf~ct by chaunt-
iug certain songs.-Perbaps this throws some
light ou the notion which sti\1 pre,·a1ls, that all
epidemic- iliseascs arise from some peculiar state
of the atmosphere.
A~ LCDOTI:S.
BusB£Qtus, in his Letters, mentions the pre·
judice of the Turk~, relating to all sorts of dis-
cases, as follows :-'fbi$ prejudice is so strong,
tlmt they dread no f'pecies of infection, not even
the plague. 1t would Le desirable to diminish it,
a.s they would then expose tben1selves less to in-
c\.·itable danger. They firmly bdieve that God
_has imprinted on the forehead of every man the
time and manner of his death, and that destiny
being inevitable, it is vain to fly from dan£er•
.Vnder the influem·e of this opinion, they have no
hesitation in handling the clothes of those in-
fected with the plague, adjm,ting their bed-clothes,
or enn wiping their faces. They reason thus :
" If God has decreed that I am to die instantly,
that event will infallibly take place. 1f such is
not his will, touching this linf'n can do me no
harm." Thus uo they conspire to spread the in.
f~::ction; nor can we be surprised, if whole families
arc frequently swept away, not a .single indivi-
dual remaining.

the ~Icgaburi:ms, those who are so debilitated by
disease as to be no longer capable of following
their tlocks, or are attacked by any complaint
esteemed incurable, are fastened by the neck to
the tail of a cow, which drags them after her
till they are strangled. This is making choice of
a sinuglar manner of lea\'ing this world.
Tnr. King of Sweden, desirous of extending
the benefits of medical assistance to the sick in·
habitants of the country, augmented the number
of Physicians resident in the '"illages, and as-
signed to each a yearly pens10n of 600 sih·er
Thalers. These Physicians are obliged, in the
leisure which their practice occasionally permits,
to instruct the Midwives, and even to superin-
tend and assist them in dangerous cases. The
inhabitants of the country pay no money for these
sernces. This beneficent monarch allows pen-
sions of 400 rix-dollars, each to four Physicians,
destined expressly to assist the sick poor gratis.

when vi~iting his opulent patients, never failed to
pay his respects to the cooks, l\Jaitres de Hotel;
and " l\Iy good friends," he used to say, " accept

L'.·\BBE' DE R£PAS read, before the Academy
.of Dijon, a l\Jemorial on the '' l\Icdicine of the
l\Iind."-" The mind," says this author, " bas
its diseases as well as the body; and mankind re-
quire Physicians for the soul as well as for the
body.'' He then proposes the establishment of a
hospital for the treatment of the diseases of the
-!llind, where persons of disturbed or perverted
imaginations spould be received. In order to
\~TCDOTE.S.
trt"at the~e complaints methodically, he proposes
to divide them into certain classes: as, 1st, A
fever of the spirits; 2d, An epidemic fever, such
as frequently rages among men of learning; 3d,
An acute fe,·er, such as is frequently the conse-
quence of scientific quarrels; 4th, A slow fever,
the consequence of intense application. It would
be tedious to follow the Abbe through all his de-
tails, which, however, are ingenious and inter-
esting. He might have added to his list of epi-
demic diseases the odium tlteologicum et medico-
rum, very generally pre,·alent and difficult to
eradicate.
A)fOXG the :\Iarsilien!, when any epidemic ma-
Jacly rages in a city, one of the inhabitants offers
himself to be sacrificed, who, during a whole year,
i"! nourished at the public expence, and fed with
enry delicacy: after which, at the end of the
year, being clothed in a habit of ceremony, he is
led through the city; and, after all sorts of curses
and imprecations are poured forth upon him, he
is thrown inb the sea. This appears a kind of
atonement, like the scape goat of the Israelites. ·

IT has been pretended, and ewn committed to

Physicians. Pliny men~ions one, upon the head

ea~es of the head. The herb which grew around
the pedestal of the statue, which the woman cured
tJf the h;l'morrhoids, erected to the honour of Jesus
Chri::-t. was a sovereign remedy for all similar
1·vmplaint::. Tbe statues of the Scythian Toxaris,
:md of the athlete Polidatnas, cured fevers. Af-

that those authors who have thought proper to

not less severe, ha\ c wished to signali2e them·
selves by a bad taste for paradox, or to she\v

tiiderably advanced in l1fe, were cured of the
~ame complaint, by remaining for some time in
a baker's oven soon after the brt"ad was drawn.
Varikbillan, ninth califf of the race of the Abns-
~ides, was cured by a method nearly similar.
1Iis Physiciau caused him to enter u limc·kiln
soon after the lime was drawn forth, and in tf1e
course of a few rlays he was totally cured of his
dropsy.
A Swtss soldier came into the hospital of the
ltn-alids in ~larch 1779, labouring under dropsy:
he died the ~Oth of December 17SO, after )Ir.
l\lorand had tapped him 57 times, and drawn
away 485 French pints of \mler, besides six more
which escaped when the body was opened.
I~ the volume of the Philosophical Transac-
tions for 1779, a catic of dropsy, still more ex-

traordinary, is mentioned ; being that of a young
woman who died at .23 years of age. In the space
of four years she submitted to the operation of
the paracentesis 155 times, and lost :3720 pints
of water.
TnE palace of the King of Sardinia, at Turin,
contains an exquisite collection of pictures. One
of the finest is by Gerard Dow, pupil of Hem-
brandt, which represents a dropsical woman con-
sulting a Physician, who is examining her u~ine
in a glass vessel. It exhibits, indeed, a chef-
d'ceuvre of art, combined with the truth of ~ature.
DR. Mo~mo, in l1is Treatise on Dropsy, makes
mention of a certain officer who insisted on his
soldiers dra"·ing their garters extremely tight, in
order to give their legs u handsome shape : this
caprice produced yery serious consequences. These.
tight ligatures sent many men to the hospit~J..l
afflicted with dropsy, of whom several even died~

absurd practice on other occasions :-The back

A Boun.oo1s of Tauris, very wealthy, had a
daughter whom he doated on, but who was so de-
lorrned, that it required all a father's aflt!ction to-
bear the sight of her. Wishing to settle her in
the world, he bethought l1jmself of marrying her
to a blind man, in hopes that he would not be
able to descry the deformity of his spouse, and so
treat her with contempt. lIe found his m.m, \\ ho
spectlily espoused his child. Soon afterwards, it
happened thnt n celebrated oculist came to Tauris,
who was said to have restored many blind persons
to their s!gb.t. Some friend:, entreated the father-

EYES.
A DLIYD man, possessed of considerable acute..
ness of intellect, being asked what eyes were;
" The eye," said he, " is an organ upon which
the air produces the same eftect as my stick does
on my hand. This must be true," added he;
" for when I place my hand between your eyes
and an object, my hand is present to you, but tllC
object is absent. The same thing happens when
I search for one thing with my cane and find an·
sG A ~ECl>Ol' f.S.
other." The same blind man dd1ncd a looking-
glass t.o be a machine which exhibits objects in
relief, at a distance from the place where they
really exist, provided they ano placed in a proper
situation relative to it. " It resembles my hand,',
added he, " which l must not place on one side
of an object which I wish to examine.'' llow
many celebrated philosophers, adds the narrator
of these Anecdote-s, have employed less subtile
reasoning to arrive at conclusions equally absurd.
THE renne deer, so useful in Xorway and the
north for drawing their sledges, is said to have
the eye-lids so constructM as to be able to sec its
way, even when the drifting of the snow obliges
the animal to keep its eyes perfectly shut.
NATURALISTS allot to the butterfly 34,650
eyes; and some have pretended lo observe, in the
single eye of a butterfly, 17,325 facet.les resem-
bling those ofa diamond, each of which they have
supposed to be a separate crystalline lens. It is
an unfortunate circumstance, that such a multi-
plicity of eyes cannot prevent these poor phalera
from rushing into the flame of ~ candle, and iO
lltrishing miserably.
.'\~ECDOTI:S. 87
TuF. eyes of the chamelt>on possess motion in
all dil1
ections, wholly independent of each other.
The one looks upwards, the other down ; one
forwards, and the other back ; and these motions
are of considerable extent.
A l'EW years ago, a certain peasant pretended
to liave imprinted on the pupils of his eyes the
remarkable words, Sit nomm Domini benedictum ;
and what was still more extraordinary, all the
neighbouring peasants evidently beheld them there
also. The report of so singular a circumstance
soon reached Paris, and the indi\·idual in question
otfered to repair thither, in order to satisfy the
lmblic curiosity: be was desired to come, and as-
~ured that all his expences should be defrayed.
He was expected in vain, and never m:1de his ap-
pearance. l\Ieanwhile, it is probable, the inscrip-
tion wns by some accident effaced.
A YOU~G lady, whose eyes were remarkably
r~d, in other respects handsome, happening to be
in company with a young man who paid his ad-
dresses to her, among other circumstances, he
thot\ght fit to praise the beauty of her eyes, term-
ing them " thTones·on which Love delighted to
~eat himself." "Upou my word,', says an elaerly
ss A~ f:CDOT£5.
gentl~man. who happened to Le prc-:t:>nt, '' if Lo\'e
resides in these eye~, he must Le hauitec.l hke the
Pre5tdent of the Faculty, whose costume is u
scarlet robe."
Ilo~IE.R terms a fine woman, " a heanty with
Mack eyes, inspiring love." Anacreon desires the
painter to gi,-c his mi~tress bldck eyes and ~\rk
eye-brows : and the Lycas of Horace is,
~igris oculis, nigroque crini decorum.
Such was the taste of the anc~ents for female-
beauty. Black eyes arc still so much admired by
the Greeks, that the term is frequently adopted as
n family name. l\Ir. Guy, in his Letters on
Greece, remarks, that he knew several persons
called Jllacromati, that is, blark-eyed.
Is a small work, entitled, " The Art of Love,''
originally read before the Society of A pathi~ts at
J.'lorence, there is a singular discussion respecting
the preference due to blue or black eyes. The
subject is treated with all the gravity and interest
of the most important physical or moral problem.
The author concludes thus: " If I must abso-
h.:tcly resolve thi!i prob~cm, I shall do so in a few
words. Setting aside the tolour of the eyes}
;\.X ECDO'fES.
~·bether they be blue, or whetl1er they be black,
I shall ever gi,·e the preference to those which
look upon me with the greatest tenderness."
DEPRIVING persons of sight, a puni:>hment
derived from Greece, was formerly common among
the Tyrants who devastated the West, as it still
1s among the nations of India. Lewis, surnamed
the Blind, was so called, because having despoiled
Bereuger, king of Italy, of some of his provinces,
and having afterwards been taken prisoner by
him, the latter caused. his eyes to be put out)
but we are ignorant of the means employed to
erlect this purpose. This barbarous punishment'
was inflicted in three ditTerent ways. The eyes
were simply blinded by pressure, they ,..,.ere torn
out of the head, or they were burned. In the
last case, the person was compelled to look stea-
dily on a concave mirror of polished steel held
opposite the sun, the rays of which were thus re--
flected with so much intensity as very soon to ex-
tinguish the sight : still as much was frequently
permitted to remain as enabled the person to write
his name. The historian Cllasier asserts, that
Lewis wac; blinded in this manner; and he founds
his opinion on this circumstance, that charter.>

them from the snow·blindnf•ss, a s~rious and very
common coml-'laint, occasioned by the reflection
of the sun's rays from the white surface. These
instruments increl:.l..?6 the powers of vi;;ion; and

they are desirous of viewing any thing at a dis-
tanre, they mechanically al-'ply them to their

to these Esqu!maux spectales has ldtely been

ELIXIR o1· LIFE.
Ax Emperor of China, named V.\X-TI, re-
ceived one day, from an impostor, an Elixir, of
which he c~horted him to drink, promi:sing that
it would (.'Onfer immortality upon him. A man·
durin present, after havinJ in vain attempted to
dissuade the Emperor from trusting in the pro•
mi~es of an empiric1
seized the cup and drank off
the li'luor. The Prmce, t:nraged at his boldnes~,
threatened to condemn him to instant death ; to
which the other, \\·ith perfect tranquillity, n•plied,
" Sire, if this Elixir really confers immortality,
you ''ill in vuin attemnt to put me to death; if it
uoes not, can you be tiO unju:;t 2s to deprh·e me of
A~I"{'DOTf.S. 93
life: for so trifling a theft t' This discourse calmed
tbe rage of the Emperor; and the history adds,
that the effect of the Elixir was to put the man~
darin's life in the utmost danger.
A~OTH'ER. Emperor of China, still more at·
tached to life than the former, and infatuated with
the secrets of the Philosopher's Stone, persuaded
himself that it was not impos:>ible to di~over an
Elixir that would render him immortal. This
notion he communicated to his Physician. The
latter tried various p!ans to escape from the un·
reasonable caprices of the Emperor: at length he
hit upon a successful expedient. He told him,
that the simples requisite to compose this pre~
ciou::; Elixir grew in some neighbouring islands,
Lut that they must absolutely be culled by pure
and innocent hands, without which they would
possess no virtue. He added, that it was neces-
sary to send thither three hundred youths and
maidens of unsullied manners and of a tender age,
yet sufficiently robust to su::.tain the fatigues of
the journey. The Emperor approved of the pro-
ject, and committed to the Physician the con-
duct of the expedition. They arriYed happily at
Japan, where, instead of amusing themselves
1\'ith the vain project of gathering plants, they
9L .A~ ECDOTF.~.
occupied themsel\'es more agreeaLly in peopling
an i!:laud, which 'vas called ::\IPO~.
E~IETIC.
1 rot<~ D the following observation in a French
,..·ork: -" \Y}lat would be said of a Physician
who, for a ~pitting of blood, ~hould prescribe an
tmctic of four or five grains of ipecacuanha?
lib r.1shness would certainly expose him to the
dension of his colleagues and the reproaches of
1he public. There is, however, in the Ilistory
Qf the Academy of Scien<.'es for J7l.'J, an obser-
,·ation of l\1. I~ohault, on a vomiting of blood,
which this practitioner repeatedly arrested by
the administration of an emetic : such facts set
at nought the reasonings of System." This af-
fords a curious proof of the changes in medical
optmon. There is no remedy more in usP. at pre-
sent in hremoptysis than ipecacuan, and no prac.
titioner, of any experience, would feel the lea~t
alarm, should the dose be such as enn to excite
actual Yomiting.

lively spirit, a diseerning tourh, and the eye of
an obserYer, fully answered the expectations of
his family. ..\t a very early age, he was ad-
mitted to the degree of Doctor, in the C'niversity
of .:\Iontpellier, which has furnished so many Phy-
sicians of high reputation to the world. Tbem•e
he came to finish his studies at Paris, and be-
came clinical pupil to l\L Yerdelhan, First Physi-
cian to the Prince of Conde, who, at that period,
enjoyed a l1igh reputation. Ilis father soon re-
called him to Avignon, as his assistant; but carried
otr by a premature death, he left him Physician
to an hospital, at an age, when the generality of
y~-men baYe not taken their degrees.
The young Gast..'l.ldy was only the more sensi-
ble of the extent of his duties. He gave him~elf
up to them with ardour, and soon succeeded to
the confidence his father had enjoyed, as he also
succeeded to the places he held.
An epidemic disease broke out at Av1gnon,
which furnished him with an opportunity of dis-
tinguishing himself. He was consulted ; and in
a few days the epidemic disappeared. The King,
as a recompense for his zeal, appointed him Phy-
sician to the hospital of Ville-Neuve; and when

our acquaintance was possessed of a tact of pn·

mained less than four hours at table; but these
four hours were so well employed in promoting
the real progress of the art, that it was impossi-
ble to mi~take this profoundness of reflexion for
any thing like tediousness. Hence the opinions
of Dr. Gastaldy had the force of laws in this
matter. From his decisions respecting whatever
appertained to the art of alimentation, there was
no appeal. llis opinion constituted law; and
should it ever be possible to fonn a collection
of such decisions, it will form the chief epicurean.

But enabled to rtsumc the ex<:rcise of his pro-
fession, he conceived he might also resume his
.tepstatory functions : and, notwithstanding the
promise he had made us, that he would remain
two months without dining abroad, he resumed
his usual course of dinners in the city. That
which he enjoyed at the table of his Excellency
the Cardinal De Belloy, Archbishop of Paris,
proved, alas! to be his last. He had helped
himself, for the third time, to a delicious joul of
salmon; which, by an accident, fortunate in other
circumstances, but most fcltal in the present, had
been placed before him, when the Prelate, who
perceived it1 reproving him gently for his impru-
dence, ordered the object of his concupiscence
to be removed; but, alas ! it was too late. Soon
after reaching home, he became insensible: be-
fore ~1. Jeanoy could arrive, in place of an eme-
tic, some inefficient palliatives had been adminis·
tered; and Death, who had so many iojuries to
revenge on him, refused again to quit his prey.
He expired the subsequent Sunday,.December 22,
and was interred, the following day, in the
cemetery of St. Eustache.
Such was the melancholy end of the most en-
\~gbtened judge of good eating and drinking that
cnr em~ated from the faculty of medicine. As

excellent a father as he had been a son and a hus-
band; a real friend, as a man open, sincere, ge~
nerous, disinterested ; he joined to the exercise
of every social nrtue, the most distinguished ta-
lents, and most polished wit. The gentleness of
his manners, the equality of his temper, the ex-
tent and variety of his acquired knowledge, ren-
dered his society peculiarly sought after. He en-
gaged the esteem of every one who knew him,
the gratitude of his patients, and the regret of
all his friends. His daughter, who was tenderly
attached to him, will long remain inconsolable
for his loss ; and the jury of degustation, to
whom it had become a habit to live under the
dominion of his laws, will for c~er lament his
loss, not having even the hope of being able to
replace him.
If, from that better world which he now inha.
bits, he deigns to cast a look on this earth, which
he honoured by sixty years of useful labours, and
estimable virtues, be will perceive how much be
is regretted; that coup-d'reil will afford to his

that he had not sufficient respect for his·l\In.jesty

by some friends, as possessing a specific for this
complaint. In compliance with their recommend·
ations, he sent for him. On his being announced,
his Lordship demanded of his servant, " Docs

scoundrel about his business. Did he possess the
secret which he pretends to, he would ride in his

intreat him to deliver me from this horrible dis-
ease." To credit this tale, a man must ha.Ye ex-
perienced the tortures of this horrible malady.
Tnt gout has been denominated the offspring
of Bacchus and Venus.
THEOPIIRASTUS has said, that mUSIC cures
the gout ; nor is that surprising, as melodious
notes are known to suspend many painful affec-
tions. In the third ,·olumc of the Lessons of
Guyon, it is affirmed, that a lady~ a great in-
\'alid, and a sad victim to the gout, sent for " n
individual who played incomparably well on the
drum and tlute, and performed with so much ve·
hcmcnce that she fell on the ground in a swoon,
deprhed of speech and yoluntary motion. Reco-

y~ring from this trance, she complained of intense
pain : the musician again bad recourse to the suc-
cours of his art: and commencing again to play,
this second dose of music, produced so good an
effect, that in a short time the patient was freed
from all her pains, and perfectly cured.
Wn£N Phillip the Second, of Spain, had the
gout, his first Physician, l\Iercatus, a man of
learning and much experience, tried a great va-
riety ofexperiments without producing any degree
of ease. Some proposed to him to call in the
Physician Valezio. When he came, he ad..-ised
the King to immerse his feet in warm water.
This simple remedy succeeded beyond all ex-
pectation. The result was, that ~lcrcatus was
discharged, and Valegio received his place.
"'nEN Biosrobert was seized with gout, Des-
preaux sent a servant to inquire after his health.
On returning, he acquainted him that the gout
was mging with redoubled fury. " I suppose he
swears heartily then," said Dellpreaux. " Alas!
S1r," said the valet, " he has no other consola-
tion, as all the Physicians have abandoned him."

trepaml<'<l, nml the third was little better than a
fool : on which Cato, the censor, rcmarkcu, that
" this embassy had neither feet, head, nor com-
mon sense."
IT was the gout that first ga\'e a turn for ma-
thematics to the celebrated Cavalieri, a Jcsuit of
.:\Iilan, and afterward professor of mathematics
at Bologna. ~Ie was dreadfully tormented with.
this mala~y when Castelli, a disciple of Galileo,
came to \'i~it him; who counsrlled l•im, by way
of. diYerting his pains, to .apply himself to geo-
metry. Cavalieri followed his advice, and took
5uch a hking fur this science, that be became one
of tl1c fir~t mathematicians of the age. Gout is
frer1ueutly the concon~itant of genius.

is furnished jn the case of Colonel Lloyd. who,

in which it may be justly said, that the remedy
ia worse than the diseas~.
LElBSITz, in consequence of wishing to be too
quickly rclie\'ed from ~attack of gout, took some
remedy from the hands of a Jesuit at Vienna.
The gout mounted from the feet to the stomach,

t.'tl by the gout, "·as cured by. a dog which he took
to slt:ep with him, and 'vhich was seized ,i;ith it.
II6 A!\ECDOTES.
The animal appeared to feel all the pains which
l1is master had previously experienced.- The
gouty may safely try this remedy: if it does not
cure them, it can assuredly do tl1em no harm.
I once saw a dog that w.ts extremely fond of
Burton ale, who certainly appeared to have every
symptom of gout, swelled joints, lameness, &c.
Licking the inflamed part with the tongue of a
dog is said to assuage the pain.
M. D.t:sAULT, a Physician of Bourdeau:(, has
given to the public a collection of medical Dis-
~ertations ; and among them one on the gout,
which he treats in a singulu manner. " Had I
composed only a romance concerning the gout, in
which saving the appearance of truth, and en-
deavoured to prove the possibility of curing this
painful malady. every arthritic would :have per-
used my Dissertation when at leisure; how much
more then is it his duty so to do, when I declare,
that all the facts on which I found my system are
true, and that I mean to deceive no person."-
The author follows Sydenham in the opinion, that
the gouty are in general persons of genius. that
it attacks men of sense in preference to fools, the
rich rather than the poor. . \\'by the rich are its
peculiar victims is not difficult to explain.-The
A'SF.CDOT£5. ll7
same author tells a pleasant story of a dispute
with a monk, who was mightily offended that be
had been cured of some disease by an infusion of
cinchona in a mixture of old wine and distilled
spirit, because it had produced a 5ligbt degree of
intoxication.
THE savage inhabitants of the Antilla Islands,
when attacked by the gout, dig a hole in the
ground, into which they throw heated coals; and
upon these they pile the fruits of the monbane,
a kind of palm : upon this they place the part
affected, and endure the hot steam as long as they
can. If this remedy does not cure, it affords at
least great relief. They term this kind of fumi-
gation Bautaner. 1\l. Bossu, in his Voyages to
America, states, that he witnessed an experiment
made by an European with this method of bau-
cannmg. He bad laboured, for six weeks, under
a severe fit of the gout in the right foot, which
completely laid him up. He determined to put
himself in the hand~ of the most famous juggler
cf the h,land, named Tonska, who treated him as
follows:- He boiled a vast variety of herbs in a.
large cauldron; this savage then covered the caul-
dron with the hide of a deer, supported by bent
branches of trees. He introduced the diseased

Ynpour arisi11g from this cauldron, aud the Euro-
pean soon received a complete cure. " I saw
him in n short time after," says l\1. Uossu, " follow
the chace, and attend to all his usual aYocations,
without incon\'cnicnce." .:\Iany imitatkms of this
sayage quackery have latdy appeared in difierent
parts of F.urope.
LuCIA~, in his dialogue calleJ Philops::eudes,
or the Lonr of Lies, ridicules the credulity of
the philosophers of his time, on the occasion of
one of the richest citizens of Athens being at-
tacked with the gout, for which C\'ery one recom-
mended an infallible remedy. The delicate and
pleasant style in which Lucian ridi<'ules these phi-
losophers, ought to induce tl1e 'curious to pcntse
this dialogue in the origin~l; the more so, because
most of"thc railleries of Lucian perfectly apply
to certain persons at' present, who, front a spirit
of quackery or intentional deceit, busy themselves
in prescribing -similar remedies. 'ntombcausant,
an author of the 16th century, 'vrote a comedy,
termed The Gout, in imitation of this dialogue
of Lucian, which is now become very rare.

A CERTAIN Abbf, who died in 1/:.32, about
the age of 51, began to perceive a slight cur-
vature in the vertebrre of his back. As it gra·
dually increased, he applied secretly to a Surgeon,
and compelled him to pass a wooden roller, with
considerable pressure, several times along his
back, hopin6 that. this operation would restore
the vertebrre to their proper position. The effect
was quite the reverse, augmenting the deformity
very considerably, which, as usual, cominueJ t()
increase during life. The Abbe was· the first to
laugh at his own infirmity, and his absurd man·
ncr of attempting to cure it; a conduct which-
tended to disarm the sneers of others.

M. PHILIPPE HEQl'ET
'\r~s an eminent Physician at Pari~, ?.bout tl1e
d use of the 16th century. lie was, in the (•ar1y
part of his life, Physician to the Monastery of
the Port floyal des Champ~, the fountain-head of
the Janscnists, as they were termed. Tl1ere he
imhibt:d tho~e r rinciples of piety and religiou
which guided and enlightened l1im through life.
Losing his health in tht: damp situation of Port
Hoyal, l1e came to Paris, and soon attainetl that
celebrity, to \\hich his Christian virtues, no less
than liis profcssion:1l acquirements, well entitled
l1im. There he became personal Physician to
many people of the highest rank. l ie never re-
laxed l1is attention to t.he poor, whom },e assisted
lJolh with his advice, and, when requisite, with
his purt.e. lie was also the medical director of
many of the most respectable rdigious commu-
nities. lie trusted much w the powers of 'Na..
ture in curing di~eases, whose processes he watch·
ed with the most unremitting attention. lie was
also a great inculcator of temperance, nnd even
aLstiuence, as means of preveuting as well as
curing disease. lie publish~d a work, in two
volumc5, 8'i0. respecting the Dispensations of
A.1\ECDOTE5. 131·
Lent; where he inculcates the necessity, and
maintains the utility, of the most austere obsen·-
ance of that season of religious penance, and mor-
tification of the bodily appetites. I Ic was also a
great partizan of the utihty of Llood-letting and
water drinking, as remedits for clisea~e. From
these circumstances, with that perverted inge-
nuity which too frequently leads the French na-
tion to ridicule whatever is really good and vir-
tuous, he is caricatured Ly Le Sa~e, in Gil
Blas, under the title of Dr. S:mgmdo ; for the
character of the Physician in the original Spani!'h
novel, whence Le Sage borrowed all the he~t
parts of his work, is quite of a ditli:rcnt stamp.
He abstained,- in his own person, from animal
fi)Od· and wine, subsisting entirely on vcgetalJle
and faripaceuu~ aliment. lle was a diligent stu-
dent of the Dible, and had so arranged the !:acrcd
text, that by reading a certain portion every day,
he perused the whole in the course of en·ry year.
llather than neglect this, or any of the duties he
had prescribed to himself, he ''"oHld pass many
nights consecutively without going to Led, con-
tenting himself with a little repose in his chair.
In every dangerous case, he made a point of vi~it­
ing his patif'nts sen~ral times a day. lie refused
the appointment of Physici.m to the Ilotd Dien,
bccau~e he conceived he could not discharge his
duty to the numerous patients it contain<"d, a::. in
his practice he made no di::-tinction bet~een the
ncb and the poor. ""llen his business incrcasl'd
so much as to require lJis keeping a carriage, he
was fre<lllt'ntly ~e~n reading in it; a custom nn·
precedented in },.ranee. In this, and many other
particulars, his character appears to have rcsem-
uled that of our excellent Fothergill, who, I ha,·e
been told, was the first Physician ever ob~ervcd
to read in his chariot in the streets of I.ondon.
Indeed, not long pre,·ious to his time, the state
uf the pavement must have rendered such a prac-
tice impossible.
Towards the latter part of his life, he declined
se~ing many patients who applied to him, deter·
mined, Ly a. conscientious motive, to see no more
tlmn lus infirmities would permit him to do jus-
tice to. .:\ certain "Iarly, of high rank, had re-
. .
pcatedly r~(turo,ted his attendance; which he de-
dined on ~ccount of the multiplicity of his en-
g~lgements. liP. at l~ngth waited on her, when,
.~c:suming an nir oi conseqtwncc, which, however,

rPpl:ed he coo!ly, " your monry ·mny serve
AX:tCDOTES. 1~3
to maintain your sen·ants and horses, but all
your wealth is not sufficient to recompence my
skill."
By his timely exhortations, and his own ex-
ample, he induced many of his patients to re-
nounce the vanities and pleasures of this world,
and lead a renewed life. Wnen his infirmities
augmented, after dividing ·his money among his
relations, and leaving libeml benefactions to the
poor, he retired to a Convent of Carmelites,
where he died, an eminent example of piety,
sincere penitence, and the practice of every Chris-
tian virtue.
ISSUE.
A WO:\IAN residing at Frenoy-le-compte, three
months · gone with child, actuat(d by a spirit of
charity, went every day to dress an issue that on~
of her poor neighbours had i'n her arm: Six
months afterwards, this charitable lady was
brought. to bed of a child, who had a natural
issue in precisely the same spot where her neigh-
bour had the artificial one. Various remedies
were in Yain employed to cicatrize this sore. The
discharge of pus, \vllich was periodical, ceased
only with the life of the child.

ITCH.
•\~ anonymous author published some obser-
vations, occasioned by the Itch in the Hotel Dieu
and other large hospitals. He, at the same time,
proposed the means of extirpating it. He ob-
sern~d, that all that was requisite was to separate
the infected patients from others, and place them
in a pure air. This was carried into effect, by
transporting them to the hospital of St. Lewis,
to the great satisfaction of the pupil:s in Surgery,
who, on cmering the hospital, never fu.iled to be
attacked by this disgusting malady.
In the Russian armies, the itch is not reckoned
u dise-..1se, nor i~ any man e\·er seut to the hospi-
tal on that account alone. It may easily be con-
'tivcd to wl!at an extent it prc\ails.
D!POTE~CE.
:\ GESTLE:\lA~ of the Court was suspected of
impotence, a rbarge which he always resented
\\ith warmth. He met Denserade one day, who
hu.d frequently rallied him on this subject. "We11,
Sir," said he, on accosting l1im, " not,rithstand-
ing all your ill-natured joke.,, my wife wus brought
'
136 A~ r.cD01"£S.
to bed this morning of a fine boy." " ~ly dear
frieud," said llenserade, " nobody ever question"d
the fecundity of your Lady."
A OENTLE~IAN whe> had a similar rt'plltatiQ~
being in company where .a Lady permitted a Gen.·
tleman to t:~.ke a kiss, this person offered himself
to obtain ,a simila1 favour. The Lady stopped
him ;..saying, " Softly, Sir, one does not ~· re:....
rlily permit a kiss to a person, for whom \t is the
last favou~/'
St' ITS, on the score of impotency, do but
little credit to the women, by whom they are in..
stituted. \Yhetber they succeed in obtaining ano-
ther husband or not, they render. themselves the
shame and disgr:ace of their day. They make
a public confession of their incontinence. Every
woman who commences a process of this kind,
declares to all the "'·orld she cannot live with-
out a husband. The interrogatories to which
!he must submit are so painf,!l and indelicate,
that it is impossible to think welt of a woman
who determines to submit to them.
An advocate embarrassed a young woman de-
sirous of commencing a process of this kind
against her husb~rul, to whom she had not been
.\!\ECDOT:ES. 137
l\lng married. He ·asked her, in the presence of·
several witnesses, whether her husband bad eyer
kis:;ed her cheek, and expressed his love and re-
gard by caresses of a similar kind. She replied
in the affinnati,·e. " And \'\"bo informed you,"
said the Ad\·ocate, " that such caresses are not
sutlicient? Where did you leam any more? If
you are a virgin, as you pretend to be, bow can
you know that your husband is impotent? If you
do know it, it is a clear p~oof that you also know
what other men arc capable oft''
hrPOTE!\C£ originates as frequently in moral
as iri physical causes; these instances are how-
ever, in general, slight and temporary. l\Iany
are the examples of men, who, after having
shewn themselves worthy of the favours of love,
have lost t~eir repu_
tation under the banners of
hymen. Aristus bad gi,~n abundant proofs of his
Yigour, ·when his heart was in unison with his
sen:;es. Duty and obedience compelled him to
enter into an engagement where propriety and the
tt'mptation of wealth were the sole ties. lfym~n
conducted him to the nuptial couch, but Copid
was not of the party. Ari:stus is inflamed by the 1
extemal senses; ?ut when on the point of giving
138 J\~ECDOT.I:S.
proof of his mauhood, he is arre&te<.l by lu~ unn-
giuation, which, representing the absence of mu-
tual eujoyment, he finds himself incapable of
cou::,ummating an act, in which, generally, the
heart is not thought to participate. Iu like man-
ner, the King of Burgundy, a valiant champion
among his courtisans, could never succeed with
llcrrnonberg, daughter of the King of Spain, after
he had espoused her. Neither could Amasis,
King of Egypt, with Laodicea, a beautiful Gre-
cian, though, with other women, he was, as
)lontague says, an agreeable companion.
There is, moreover, a species of impotence,
which originates in too much ardour. A noble
Venetian married a beautiful girl, at an age when
loYe is, in general, ,liberal of his fa,•ours. There
was no defect of v~gour, but the essential was
wanting to his happiness: the pleasure that ought
to have crowned his extasies, escaped at the mo-
ment. llut his dreams furni!>hed abundant proofs
of his capability. He mude trial of various.
means to remedy this misfortune. lie even re-
quested the Ambassadors of the Republic at the
vai·ious courts of Europe, to consult the most
celebrated Physicians respecting the cause of this
singular pri\·ation; and, it is said, that at kugth
.~ ~ I:CDOTI.S. 139
~orne one was fortunate enough to hit upon a re-
medy which restored this nol.ile ,.enetian to his
privileges and enjoyments.
To proYe how much the mind is connected
with this class of complaints, and how careful
IJJedical men should be in managing the minds of
patients labouring under similar halucinations, the
following authentic narrative is here inserted:-
A young man, of a strong and ardent imagina-
tion, whose athletic appearance offered the most
satisfactory proof that his constitution had suf~
fered no material injury from some improper ha-
bits acquired at school, about the age of twenty;
happened, accidentalty, to peruse the treatise of
the celebrated Dr. Tissot. From some of the
horrors there detailed, his mind, naturally sus-
ceptible, immediately took. the alarm. He con-
ceived, that he had for ever ruined his constitu-
tion, had rendered hin1self impotent, and under
the imvtession of being his own assassin, was
bccpme unfit to live. So powerfully was his ima·
giuation affected by the supvosed enormity of his
crime, and influenced by the notion that it was
his duty to warn other~ agaiust a ::.iwilar danger,
that he purchased every copy of Tissot he could
lay his ·hands.on, carried them in his pocket, and
1!0 A N!.CDO'l'ES.
tlistributed them, accompanied with suitable re-
monstrances, to such young men, and even to
the young women of his acquah1tance, whom he
conceived to be in danger of lapsing into similar
errors. The derision to wllich such conduct ne-
cessarily exposed him, tended to aggra\·atc his·
mental distress; he, however, took the trouble,
as he expressed himself, in smne letters delibe-
rately left for the perusal of his friends, to drag
on existence for a twelvemonth, under the pres-
sure of these afflictions, in order that he might
be enabled to discharge some trifling pecuniary
obligations. This purpose being completed, he-
put a period to his existence by shooting himself
through tl1e head.
TYING TnE PoiNT. IT is not uncommon to
see men afflicted with impotence, wl10, in fac~,
labour under no other deficiency than that of com-
mon sense. I mean those who concei,-e thcm-
selves·bewitched ; a folly ·which, though not so
common at the present day as formerly, still pre-
vails among the vulgar, especially those who re-
side in remote villages. It would be useless here
to relate a number of examples to prove the
ignorance and presumption of those persons who
arrogate to themselves the power of what is
A::\' r.CDOT'ES. 141
termed tying .the point. It requires but a slender
deoree of information, to oe cohvinc·ed of the to·
0
tal impossibility of rendering fl. man -iinp'otent by
pronouncing c.ertain ' mysterious w<Jrds, or the
practice of some ridiculous ~eremonies, employed
by impostures to terrify We.lk and credulous·minds.
But it may be said, certain men are unaHe to
consummate their marriage; and this because they
are under a spell : they have been threatened,
and that is. the true cause of their impotence. It
is not the spell that is the cause, but the imagi-
nation of a weak man, who has been intimidated
by threats, and thus been deprived of l1is natu-
ral powers.
. VEX·ETTE, in his work on l\Ian aud \\oman,
s~ys, that he saw in a village m Pican.ly, a spring
...., J
surr<?~ded by three trees, bung round with mys-
terious ligatures, composed of various materials.
lie was told, that these were so many spells im-
posed on lovers to cause impotence. lie in vain
endeavoured to induce some person to destroy
these trees. He contented himself with obliteral·
ing all the insignia of the power which a cer:tain
shepherd .of the can.ton pretended to possess over
his companions. This bold step was. admired,
but the· belief in enchantment was not destroyed.

who obtained very great celebrity, was denomi·

died in the year 1781.-The following is a sue·
cinct account of his life :-lie wns born at Piehan,
a village about six miles from Berne. Preter-
ring the profession of Chirurgery, he was appren-
ticed to a country surgeon, anti pmctised this de-

partmcnl (1f the ht•aling .art for l wenty-thc yc.m.
without obtaining nuy great celebrity; but he ac-
quired a. con::.idcnlhle knowledge of·hi:; profession.
Left to himself, as it wae, without books and
without.a::.sistaucc, ht! procun.:t.l dead bodies, Jis-
sectcd them, and describccl all the disca:tcs thnt

diseases. At length, some unexpected cures
spread his fame through the whole canton.
Entirdy deYoted to his profession during the
la.st :sixteen years of hi::.. life, there wa:;, perhaps,
hardly any Physician who ~d t(eatetl more pati-

LUNAR INFLUENCE.
1\L\~Y ages have elapsed since it was obsen•ed
that certain diseases were caused by the influence
of the sun and moon, and that tbe symptoms of
others change according to the position of these
luminaries. For this reason, Hippocrates, writ·
ing to his son Thessalus, exhorts him to the study
of Geometry, and the science of numbers, as in-
troductory to the knowledge of Astronomy, which
is of great use in medicine.
It is only since attempts have been made to
accommodate all phenomena to the reasonings of
a recent system of philosophy, that attempts
have been made to attribute all the changes of
our health to the influence of the atmospheric
::nr. But, allowing that tl1ese changes of the air
do necessarily affect us, are they not also pro-

t.luced J,y the sam<: causes which influence the
tlux and reflux of the oreau, which is univer-
sally uttriLutt•d to the operation of tl;e sun and
moon? Philosophers ought to pay attention to
certain fact::;. whirb indicate stnking movements
in the humours, and that cause diseases rcguln.rly
to concur with the motions of these bodies. These
facts some may regard as fictitious, inwnted to
~urport a particular theory. llut the celebrated
.Mead has reduced such phenomena to a methodi-
C'al order, to prove the influence of these lumina-
ries on the complaints to which human nature is
liable.
· Epilepsy, that complaint so very difficult to
cure, has this striking phenomenon, that certain
persons are liable to be attacked regularly at the
new and full moon. Galen asserts, that the moon
regulates the periodical t.ttacks of epilepsy : for
tLis rea-:,on, the Greeks denominated such per-
t•uns Selcniac!), and Seleniazomeni, terms whirh
have :;ince been changed into Lunatics. .In Bar...
tholiue':; .\natomy, a case is mentionerl ofan epilep-
tic, wbo::;e countenance was co\'ered with blotches,
which \'aricd in c ,}our and dimensions according
to the phases of the moon. l\Iead relates the
case of a girl, about five years of age, affected
1dth convulsions, of which the returns were so
ANECDOTE~.
fr.:-qucnt, that her life was despaired of. At full
moon her convulsions were alwn.ys most \iolent,
and they decreased with the waning moon. While
the tide flowed, she"was deprived of speech, which
!:lhe recovered during the ebb. Her father, who was
a waterman on the Thames, bad long observed
these periodical recurrences, and was so accus-
tomed to consider his child better or worse, ac-
cording to the state of the tide, that although he
heard her cries during the reflux, he had uo occa•
sion to enter his house to learn the state of her
health.
TuE late Lord Londonderry being engaged to
dine at Hampstead, the night before he was to set
out, he dreamed that be broke his leg at a parti-
·cular stile. This dream, from some circum-
stances, had so much weight with him, that
he resolved to walk; and in getting over that
very stile of which he dreamed, his foot slipped,
so that be entangled and broke his leg.-This
5tory he himself told to Major Rook, who told

l\L\XDIL\GORA on nn ro~Y.
Sucn is the name of a plant <lestilute ut"
Lra.uches, of which two species were formerly ac-
knowledged. The \\ hitc, or male; and the black,
or female. The ancients, and some moderns,
haYe told strange things of this plant ; most of
which are, indeed, absurd fables. Albert, for
example, says, that .l\landragora is an image of
the l1t1man species, in which even the distinl'tion
of the sexes is eYident; he asserts, that it grows
only under gibbets, that it is produced by a mix-
ture of the urine and fat which exude from the
suspended criminals ; a tale, on a par with that
which produces men from the serpent's teeth,
sown by Cadmus, or makes Orion spring from -
Lhe urine of Jup1ter, !\lercury, or Xeptune. Such
aho is the belief, that when the root is tom up,
it sends forth a feel,le cry. Such too 1s the blind .
credulity which persuades men that to deracinate
this plant is an action atteuclcd with great danger,
so that the person who ,·entures on this art becomes
liable to the attack of n.ll sorts of diseases ; hence
abo, the precautions which, according to Pliny,
the ancients used in pulling this plant, such as by
fastening a dog to it by a chord, and whipping
him till he succeeded in pulhng it up, &c. &c.

In much later timc::s, the roots of the ~Iandra­
gora have been supposed to be proline. ::\foscs
says, that Reuben, the son of Lea, being abroad
in the fields, found some mandragoras, which he
brought to his mother. Rachael bec~mc envious
of them, and requested them from Lea; ·who
gave her them, on condition that Jacob should
pass the following night with her. Rarhael hav-
ing a great desire to have children, there is rea-
son to presume, that lt was with this view she
requested the mandragoras of Lea. What confirms
this conjecture is, that the ancients gave to man-
dragora the name of Lou Apple, and that Venus
is c!enominated 11lanclragoriris. The Emperor
Julian writes to Cali:xiness, that be is drinking
the juice of mandragora to render him amorou~.
It is also certain, that Rachael conceived and
brought forth a son after haYing eaten of it, for
which she thanked the Lord; and what is still
more certain is, that this property of exciting
lust has been attributed to the mandragora by all
nation<;, and in all times. l\Iachiavel has written
a comedy on the subject of this vulgar prejudice.
Jean-Baptiste Rousseau has ·also written a come-
dy, in five acts, on the same subject, which is
vnnted in his works:

A~ esteemed author, 1\I. l\Inillet, who was the
l rcnch Consul at Cairo, says, that a thousand
years before the Christian j£ra, there were at
the two extremities of Egypt, Temples dedicated
to Saturn, to which the melancholic people of
the neighbouring places resorted in quest of relief.
Some cunning Prief:ts, proJiting by the credulity
of· tnese hypochondriacks, associated with the
pretended miracles of their powerless divinities
and their barren mysteries, natural means, by
which they always solace'd the patients, and some-
times even cured them, when their disease was
sli-ght aud recent.
These means were diversions, and recreatiYe
exercises of all sorts, to· wl1ich the invalid was
religiously subjected. Voluptuous. paintings and
seducing images were exposed to their Yiew.
Agreeable songs and melodious sounds perpetually
charmed their ears. Gardens of .flowers and or-
namented groves furnished delightful walks, and
delicious perfumes; in a word, every moment was
cons~>crated to some diverting scene, to grotesque
dances, to ever varying pleasures, mingled with
l1ieroglyphic and devoutly chearing ceremonies ;
A~l:CDOTE.~. 151
properly adapted a.t:td scrupulously (lbsen·ed regi-
men, supported this methodical treatment.
A thousand attentions, a thousand studied kind-
nesses from the rcli~ious ministers rendered these
agremens more powerful and lively. All this
formed favourable diversions to the diseased mind,
interrupted the train of grief, calmed the restless-
ness of thought, dissipated sorrow, a·nd often
wrought salutary changes, which they took care
to make the best use of, to inspire confidence, and
to establish the credit of the Tutelar Divinities;
the aftiicted came from these fortunate asylums;
for the most part, in the firm persuasion of a ra-
dical cure.
The Egyptian Physicians ac;sisted sometimes to
support the credit of these new restoratives: they
often knew neither the true nature of the disease,
nor the proper remedy; and in order to get rid of
their patients, they adnsed t.hem to repair to these
famous temples, as our Physicians send their
patients to the waters of Pyrmont, of Spa, of
Bath, &c. Non propter sa/ubritatem aquarum, sed
propter lor1ginquam perigrinationem.
"'no would have conceived that medicine would
have dared to employ the itrh as ameans of cure?
Such, l10v~:ever, is_ the fact.- In 1760, a ·shoe;
A 'Nl.CDOT.£S,
maker, of a melancholy temperament, was sud-
denly sei~ed with insanity : be was rece1ved into
the hospital at Berlin. During two years, he
remained in a state of lethargy. .
l\1. l\lutzel,
Physician to the hospital, tried eYery means to
rouse hiru. Twenty grains of emetic tartar caused
him to vomit ouly O!ICe. Blisters produced no
effect. 1\I. l\Iutzell conceived the idea of em-
ploying a remedy that might occasion a violent
commotion both in tl1e solids and fluids. The itch
appeared to him the most likely means to answer
his purpose. lie scarified the arms and legs of
his patieut, and applied to them pustules of the
itch. The patient shewed no signs of sensibility
during the operation. After two days, the pulse
quickened ; the third, fe,·er was evinced; it aug-
mented till the fifth. The patient exbibited
symptoms of anxiety, uneasiness, and difficulty
of hreathing. About the eighth day, the heat of
the skin diminished, and a slight perspiration
manifested itselt: Red pustules made their ap-
pearance on the surface of the body. On the
ninth day, reason aad speech, which had been
lost for two years, retumed. The patient replied
with precision to the questions asked him, and
left the hospital in perfect hc~lth three weeh &.ftcr
the inoculation of the itch. This is certainly an
A~ E.CDOTES. 153
uncommon m~ans of curing a disease. Perhaps,
few Physicians will be found bold enough to em-
ploy it, and still fewer patients poisessed of suffi-
cient courage to submit to it.
'fnt:RE was a time, say~ Plutarch, when the
caughters of the ~Iilcsians were possessed by an
overpowering melancholy in such a manner, that
they were all seized with a sudden desire to die;
and that several had already hanged themse\Yes.
"·ise remonstrances, even menaces,and the best ad-
ministered remedies, were equally useless; all could
not cure this cruel frenzy; and the depopulation
of the young females had become general, when a
citizen, whom Plutarch does not name, advised
the publishing an Edict, declaring: that the body
of every young woman who should hang herself,
should be dragged naked through the streets unto
the market-place. Shame effected what no other
means could; and the fear of being exposed
naked, though after death, served to re-establi~h
the reason of the l\lilesian women.
GALt.N mentions a Hypochondriac who ima-
gined himself to be tramfonned into a cock, ~6
that he used to crow at all hours, and move. his.
arms in the way that cocks beat their wmgs.

Another was persuaded, that they had cut his
hea<l otT, and taken it away. His Physician,
name<l Philotimus, cured him, by putting a hea\'y
iron llelmet on his skull ; the weight of which,
compelled him to acknowledge that he still had a.
J:ead on his shoulders.
.
lloERilAAYE speaks of one of these )!admen,
"•}w took it.. in his head not to make water any
more, l.c5t "he should inundate the town in which
he residec;J. This folly would baye been ht;:; death,
it his Physi~ian had not bethought of making an
outcry around him, that the town was on fire, and
1t would he consumed, unless he would ha\'e the
goodness'to expel Lis urine in order to extingui:,h
the conflagration. This reason appeared so good
to the hypo~hondriac, t.hat he made water, and-
was cured.
Such are the remedies which it is necessary to
put in practice, in the treatment of these sort of pa·
tit:nts; to agree with all that they desire, and to
fieceive them; in thi' consists: all t.be secret.-

ing himself into it altogether, they are obliged to·
chain him?
In lieu of medicines, observe the means which
a Portuguese Physician made use of with com·
plete success. He, at the beginning, pretended to
agree with his patient that it was horribly cold;
and he was quite right to warm himself well, an'd
that it was wrong not to allow him to approacli
the fire as much as he liked ; but, said he to him,
" Since they are obstinate not to·let you war~
yourself in your own way, I advise you to clothe
yourself from head to foot in a good fur, which
will warm you much better and more equally than
toe fire." The patient thought this an excellent
idea. He was, therefore, muffled up in a sheep
skin, \vhich had been first dipped in spirits of
wine, and when he was clothed in it they set it on
fire. He soon saw himself covered with a sheet
of flame: but, so far from being afraid of the
nrc, .be leaped about for joy, in proportion as it
made its progress, arrd after some··moments, he
cried ont that at length he was warm. ·· He was.
quickly stripped, and never afterwards complained.,
of being cold. '

A T AYLOn. bad an ulcer in his nose, which
a Surgeon undertook to cure; but all his attempts
only made matters worse. The pain became so
intolerable, that the taylor was obliged to quit
his trade. In a short time, his nose dropped

charge of fifty crowns for his trouble! But the
Taylor, instead of paying his demand, carried his
complaint into a court of law, and attributed the
loss of his nose to the ignorance of the surgeon.

" God preserve your eye-sight!" "The sneezer,

purgatives, by way of preparation, he appointed
a day for cutting off this fly with a pair of scis-

keep his eyes shut, gave a snap with his scissars,
and dropped a dead fly with a few drops of blood,

SICK NURSES.
THERE exists at La Chapelle, an Establish4

is a,co1went of female religious, termed Aleriens,
founded expres~ly for the purpose of furnishing
the inhabitants with nurses, properly instructed,
to take care of them in sickness. Then~ is also
another convent for furnishing females with nurses
of their own sex. Such establishments would be
extremely useful in all great cities, provided such
nurses were not allowed to go beyond their proper
limits, and interfere with the practice of physic,
to which attendants on the. sick are always to()
prone. .

Radcliffe told niead one day, on the latter's
5ta.rting for practice, " There are two ways, my
boy, for a Physician to treat his patients; either
to bully or to cajole them. I have taken the
first, and done very well, as you see; you may
take the latter, and perhaps do equally welL"
Skill in pursuits not very consonant to medical
ones, now and then, has a great effect in pro~ur­
ing practice; it has been found to have been of
great use to affect fox-hunting, boxing, &c. Sin-
gularity* is what affects the general run of man-
lind with wonder, and from wonder to admiration
the transition is obvious. A Physician too should
never affect ignorance of the cause of any com-
plaint; he should even place it in the pancreas, or
the pineal gland, if be bas no other place ready for
it. He must always be ready with .an answer to
e\·ery question that a lady puts to him; the odds
are, that she will be satisfi~d with it; he must

J did uot expose his ignorance, but desired his
partner to advise ~im to be more cautious another
time!'-A Lady was one day \·ery anxious to
know how long she should be ill. " 1\ladam,"
replied the Physician, q that depends on tlre
duration of the disease." " 1\Iuch obliged to you,
Doctor, for your information," was the Lady's
lVlSC answer.
A Physician should never neglect to take his
fee; it is astonishing how the aurum solidum
quickens his faculties, and sets them to work with
double effect.-A celebrated Physician at Bat.Il,
late~y ·deceased, upon not finding himself better
for his own prescriptions, said, laughingly, to
a friend, one day, " Come, I think I will give
myself a fee; I am sure I shall do better then."
The Doctor put his hand with great solemnity into
one pocket, and passed over a guinea to the other:
this had the desired effect. The same J>hy·
sician, on receiving the last feee he took in this
world, a few days before he died, said, holding it
up with streaming eyes, to a friend that was near
him, " Ultimus nomanorurn, my good frieud."-
The late Dr. 'Yard used to ('all Physicians "'fht

scasengers of the human race;" and so indeed
they -are, when they condescend to visit a dram·
drinking woman, or a crapulous man, with the same
apparent attention with which they would visit a
person in a pleurisy, or a putrid fever.-A late Phy·
sician of Bath (who was a fine gentleman, as well
as a good scholar and eminenfPractitioner), when
sent for to a patient who in'dulged himself in strong
drink, used to inquire of what particular liquor he
"'as fond, and to make him drink it weil dilut~d
with wa~r, after he had given him a pretty strong
vomit; this, of course, rather indisposed the pa-
tient against his beloved potation for some time.
A .very singular story is told of this celebrate(!
practi.tioner. He used to go to some coffee-house
in the city, where he gave·bis advice gratis, or
for 1ialf a fee. A celebrated miser, who lived
near London, to save his money, presented him-
self before him in a shabby coat, and with a
nr.y fine :nosegay, ·which he gave to the Doctor
(who was exceedingly' fond of flowers); telling
him, that he was a poor man, and had nothin'g
better to give him for his advice. The sagacious
Physician, who knew him through all his dis·
guise, asked him if he did not live near Chelsea,
and if he bad ever seen '1\Ir. - , the disguised
gentleman:s real name. On his telling him that
164 AS I.CDOTF.S.
he knew him very well, " Well then," added he,
" when you see him, give my compliments to
him, and tell him that Old Nir.k will have him
~re three wt-eks are past.''-The person went
home, and, as the story goes, died within tLe
time, to complete his Physician's prediction.
To some court lady, who was much oppressed
with a nenous complaint, then called vapours,
who asked him what ~he was to do to get rid of
them, be said, " Your Grace must either eat
nnd drink less, take exercise, take physic, or
continue sick."
It has always been found of great use to a Physi-
cian to be of some particular sect in religion: be is
in general pretty sure of those that belong to it,
and to some other patients out of curiosity. lie
should be a Catholic, a Presbyterian, a Q•1aker, a
Sandemonian, a Swedenburgian, or a Jew. In this
country, indeed, be may pick and choose. 'fbe
thee and thow of the late Dr. John Fothergill, of
London, was supposed t~> be worth £. 2000 a
year to him at least. A Physician (if be hap-
pens to be sent for by a nobleman or a lady of
quality) should never cease telling his poor ple-
beian patientl:> of his being called in by a pHson
of that rank. Ile should tell his wondering

l1is skill by this very discerning person, and should
mix up some anecdotes of the great family for
his patients, with as much nicety as he would
compose a box of pills.
It has oftentimes been .of use to a physician to
gi,·c good dinners and suppers, and card-parties
and balls, at his house ; the allure of good cheer
and amusement is very often as good a bait for a
patient as a 1\Iay-fiy is for a trout. If, however,
he wants immediate practice, and does not very
much care whether it is continued or not, a
pamphlet, attacking some ancient axiom in me-
dicine or in diet, or the mere dressing up old
doctrines in a new manner and in a new style,
will do extremely well.
A celebrated brochure upon health, written
some years·ago, brought into its author's pocket,
in three months only, one thousand guineas. The
Doctor, however, made a full stop there; and
an excellent Physician at Bath (then the father
of the waters) said, that, in consequence of the
ex('essive temperance into which many foolish
persons had too suddenly thrown themselves
from the contrary extreme, the salutary springs
over which he presided were, in the year in
which this pamphle~ came out, more frequented
than he had ever known them. So wonderfully
s .lgadous is crude and inexpcrimental theory, and
1GG AN ECDOTI:S.
so fatal at laht to the Doctor as well as to lu~
patient.
With Eton and \Yestminster, and classical 'J)er-
Sons, the idea of a Physician's being a good scho-
lar· has great weight; as if the putting together
with difficulty in a particular language, what is
perhaps not worth telling \n any, displayed much
strength of thinking or acuteness of mind. This
1s, hov;ever, thought of so much consequence uy
some Physician in England, long after they have
-quitted their ::lassical pursuits, that they pay some
indigent scholar to put their thoughts into elegant
Latin for them.
So much for the arts, not the art of Physic;-
that art, so complicated, so difficult, so useful
and honourable, when practised with skill and
integrity, that the rant of I'liny respecting it is
hardly hyperbolical ; " Diis primum inventores
suos as&ignavit medicina celoque dicavit :" and,
according to Rhasis (to whom, as a Professor,
some allowance ought to be made when he speaks
of his art), " Medicina tota est Dei, et est res
venerabilissima.''
CnAucEn's description of the Physician of his
day is so quaint, lively, and accurate, that one
thinks he sees the person standing before him. It
is wcl1 worth transcribing; which I do from an

SURGERY.
W11 r.=-- Pultowa wns besieged by Charl~s the
Twelfth, 111 1(09, that monarch was so severely
woundr.rl by a cannon ball in the leg, that the
Surgeonil had determined on amputation. One of
them, named ~EW;\f,\X, undertook to cure thn
Kin;:; without proceeding to this last extremity,
pro\ ided he would submit to all the incisions re-
quisite to avoid the necessity of amputation. The
King replied, " I do not wish to be spared more
than the lowest of my soldiers. Cut as JOU
think neces~ary ; I command you." ~ewman,
encouraged by this discourse, made profound in.
<:isions, during which the King himself ht'ld his
leg. The operation was conducted with so much
-:.kill, that the King recovered, and saved his Jcg.
This instllnce shews in what consists the merit
of a real Surgeon. lie snses a limb, '' hich an-
other, less skilful, would base sacrificed. It is
easy to find operators, hut not so to find well-
informed men, who know how to perform a cure
and avoid a murderous operation. Of such it
may be truly said, they are rari nantes in gurgit~
urstv.

Physician at Bremen, mentions, in his works, a
etorY of a woman who cut the scrotum and its
contents from Ler husband, in re\·enge for some
insults and blows she had receh·ed at his hands.
~I. Dox.\L, Surgeon at Listeron, wrote to )!r.

death, was fow1d to have carried in his enlarged
~crotum a mass of the rigure of a fretus, enclosed
in its membranes, of which the head, the feet,
the eyes, the bones, and the cartilages, were dis-

~Il:DH I'\P, is practil:ed in Japan by a kind of
llennits called Jammabos. The people have the
more confidence in their art, that they employ no
11atural methods in performing their cures, but a
kind of Sorcery. While the patients are giving a
faithful account of what they feel, the Jammttbo
is occupied in tracing on paper certain characters,
which ha,·e analogy with their temperaments and
the disea5e with whicl1 they are afflicted. ~ext

by Cnpt. Evrn:;on. When they were mustering
this ship's cr('w, oue of the sailors requested hi~
dicharge, as being affiictcd with scun·y. M.
Hot:ppe said, that before discharging him, they
v.ould endeavour to reHore his health; and ga,·e
tl.is :ts a reason for not immediately complying

the character of the di':>casc. " Such quantities
of putrid flesh,'' says he, " grew upon the gums
flf our soldiers, that the barbers were under the
necessity of cutting it otf, to enable the men
to march and to swallow their food. l1

Thi5 passage proves, as M. Charnel well observes,
in his " History of }'rench ~tedicine," the fal-
lacy of the opimon of those who belieYe that the
scun·y is a disease only known within the three
last centuries, and is a compl..1int endemic to the
nations of the north, hordering on the sea. The-
scun·y was known to the Greek$ and Romans.
The army led by Germanicos beyond the Rhine,
was infected with it. A change of air appears t(}
be one of the most certain remedies for scurvy.
Thus the wl10le army of St. Lewis would probably
have perished, if, after their multiplied disas-
ters and defeats, the remainder had not reached
F1anre.
'The total banishment of the scurvy from the
British navy, may be reckoned among the great-
est improvements, rather indeed triumphs, of mo-
dem science.

TuE followwg is nn instance of a singular curt:
of a disease of the stomach. The prior of llano-
les-Damcs, 80 y~ars of age, had laboured fur
five years under a complaint of the stomach, of
which the periodical retu1p kept him in a. state
of perpetual suffering, from five in the evening
till supper-time. It occurred to him one day at
dinner to eat some nuts, and he ute a considerable
quantity, enough to have disordered even a man
in sood health. He ·laid his account with an ag-

he felt nothing of it. After this trial, he tla.l-

provision of that fruit, and ~~n~umed at his ~ble,.
in the course of six months, not less tha~ four-
teen bushels. lie was entirely cured by this
means, never having experienced a single retu.m
of the complamt.-Ther~ is no accou~ting for p~­
culiaritie.s of constitution. I knew a lady, of a
very costive habit, '' ho found nuts the only thing
that kept her body regular, and who consumed
large quantities with that intention.
LICET'l"S, in his work " De Lucernis antiquo-
rum ReconJttis," relates, that the Professor of
Anatomy at Pisa, dissecting a body in the Amphi~
theatre, and hokling a candle in his band, ou
opening the stomach, a vapour issued forth which-
immediately took fire. Similar examples are re-
corded in the )lemoirs of the Academy of Sci-
ences.-Since the nature of elastic and inflamma-
ble gases has been understood, these pha:nomena
would not excite the surprise they did formerly.

opened in presence of fifty persons, as well me-
dical as others.. The stomach appeared consi·
derably distended, and, ,on opening it, forty-four
foreign substances, of vanous kinds, were disco-
nred ; of which an inventory was drawn up on
the. spot. They were of ~a~ious sizes and sorts ;
chiefly large pieces of oak, ash, and deal; a

two pieces of tinned iron, a knife with a hom
handle and steel blade, &c. From t11e depositions
of various persons, it appeared that all these
matters had been swallowed from time to time by
the patient himself, and by no means introduced
into the stomach after death, as some persons
chose to imagine.
AN eminent Surgeon in Dublin, who is no less

e:dract the stone. The desire of singularity ap-
pears to have suggested it. After having made
an opening into the bladder, according to the me·
thod recommended by Celsus, he used no instru-
ment to extract the stone; but endeavoured to
draw it forth by suction. The insufficiency, not
to mention the disgusting na.ture of this operation,
made it fall into oblivion very soon after its in-
vention. There is a curious work, by the same
author, De Passionibus 1lluuerum, printed at Ve-
nice in 1555, 8vo. .
TnE JEgyptians employed a method for ex-
tracting the stone not less extraordinary. In
place of making incisions in the parts, they blew
air into the urethra, by means of a proper instru-
ment, till the canal was so distended as to permit
the stone to pass. " When I was in JEgypt,'"
says Prosper Alpinus," there was ~Arab named
Ilaly, celebrated for performing this operation.
I have seen him repeatedly perform it, with the
most complete success, in the following manner !
By means of a wooden tube, about eight inches
long and nearly the size of a finger, he blew, with
considerable force, into the canal of the urethra;
and, to prevent the air from penetrating int(} the
bladder, he compressed the ulterior extremity of
186 A NECDOTI.S.
the ur~thrn by his finger against the pubis. lie
next secured the orifice of his canula. 'f!>en an
assistant, introducing his finger into the anus,
endeaYoured to forC'e and guide the stone into the
urethra. The operator then raised the hand with
which he had compressed the neck of the blad·
der, and continued, by gentle pressure) to work
the stone towards the orifice .of the urethra, nnd,
withdrawing the canula, brought the stone out at
the opening of the prepuce." l'rosper Alpinus
asserts, what indeed is rather difficult to credit,
ihat this operation was uniformly successful.
A C'EltTAIN financier laboured under the stone,
and, being a public character, the event of the
operation was a general subject of conversation.
Some one inquiring what could have caused this
stone? another replied, that he supposed his
heart had dropped iuto his bladder,
Jy the year 1723, DouGLAS, the Surgeon,
was complimented, by the Lord ·
Mayor of Lon-
don and the Court of Aldermen, with the freedom
of the city, for having reviwd and perfected the
high operation for the stone, which was at that
period introduced into all the hospitals. And in
the year following, the Lord Chancellor, accom-
A~ECDOTES. 187
panied by seYeral persons of high rank, repaired
t<l St. Bartholomew's Hospital, to witness the
operation performed ·in this novel manner by the
theq Surgeons Hombes and Dobbins.- Such is
the vicissitude of things, that the operation for
the stone is probably not at present performed in
this manner by a single Surgeon in Great Britain.
The chief improvements in the manner of per·
forming the high operation, are certainly due to
Father Cosme. So frequent is the stone in
France, or so great the resort of persons to the
capital for the sake of being operated upon, that
there.are examples of the operation being perform-
ed twelve times, at the Hotel-Dieu, iu one day.
A CARMELITE Friar, a celebrated preacher,
on the eve of being operated on, to relieve him
from a stone in the bladder, inquired of the Sur-
geon, with much anxiety, " whether the oper-
a.tiou would not occasion impotence?"
TnE late l\1. Morand, M. D. published a long
letter, in the .l\Iercure de France, announcing the
wonderful discovery he had made, that rats are
liable to stone in the bladder. He also announces,
what he considers as .still more extraordinary,
that rats become liable to this disea&e only in
188. A NI:CDOT£8.
con!equence of eatmg too much cheese. The au·
thor then enters into some nry prolix details
concerning this complaint as it exi!>ts in rats,
which can be of no great consequPnce, as pro-
bably no Surgeon will ever think of operating on
these animals. The Doctor had better advise his
patients to be less luxurious in their diet, aml re-
frain from cheese.

SKULLS.
A:\IOXG the ancient 1\Iexicans, the day on
which they sacrificed their prisoners of war was
a high festival. They re~en·ed their heads to
construct what they termed, " The cemetery of
sacrifices." That is to say. a kind of amphi-the·
atre, constructed of the heads of the dead, of
which the faces and teeth being all turned out-
wards, presented a most terrific spectacle. The
entrance to this tdifice consisted of fuur lofty
towers, composed of the same materials. The
Spaniards say they counted more than three hun-
dred thuu::.<~.nd heads in the compo:.ition of this
edifice, imlcpendently of the towers. Persons
were empl0) ed whose sole occupation it was to
teplace the skull::, which occasionally tumbled
dawn, and to maintain the whole in proper repair.
190 A"S'ECDOTC.;:,.
A SrLT.\X, in the course of bis walks, stum.
bled upon a poor Den-ise, who was holding a.
skull on his knees, which he se£med to be con-
templating nry earnestly, plunged in a pr~
foWld reverie. The attitude and seriousness of
the Den·ise surprised the Sultan. lie accosted
him, and inquired the subject of his reflection~.
': Prince," replied the Monk, " I found this head
early this morning; and ever since, I have heen
endeavouring, in ··ain, to discover whether it be-
longed to a powerful monarch like your )Jajesty,
or to such a poor Den·i!e as myseli."
TnE. Feuillants of the last refom1 invented a
5it~ular kind of mortification. They place hu·
rna~ skulls upon the t:csble, '""hich they use as
drinking cups.-1 ha•·e heard that there exist~
more than one club of young men in Londo~
·who have a human cranium handsomely .fitted u~
with sil--er as a cup, out o( which they ddnk
certain toasts, not in proof of their mortitication,
but to evince their courage--or ratl1er their folly.
FATJtEP. IIo~oR£, a celebrated Capuchin,

ous truths of relig10n in a wa.y approaching to the
burlesque; yet, when on the very Yerge of pro-.
A~r.CDOT£51. 191
ducing laughter, he affected the heart.. During
the course of his sermon, on one occasion, he
drew from under his gown a burP-an cranim_n, and
holding it up, addressed it in his provincial1_ dia•
lect thus; " Are you the skull of a i\Iagistrate ?',
The skull, ofcourse, ~aking no answer, he addecl,
'' Silence g~ves consent." He then clapped upon
the skull the cap of a judge, and gave him a. se-
vere reprimand for the malversations committed
by him in the exercise of his functions. He then
threw the head aside, and tossing up several others
in succession, address~d to each of them a dis-
course analogous to the character he bestowed on
them. He dressed them differently, according to
the condition of life he imputed to them, ahyays
terminating his harnwgue with the same q~rden,
" Silence gives consent."-This. may ha\e been
the origin of out celebrated Stevens's Lecture on
Heads, and may abo atrord an useful hint to some
of our mountebal)k Preachers, who have already,
approached very nearly to such eJo.hibitions.

the house was inhabited by a Sorcerer. The other
Strelitz's, infected by the fear of their comrade,
quickly spread a report that this Sorcerer caused
the dead to dance to the sound of his lute.
The Czar and the Patriarch appoiuted three
persons to Yerify the fact. The council was as-
sembled, and the poor Surgeon sentenced to be
burned alive, together with his skeleton.
Fortunately, a gentleman somewhat better in-
fanned than the council, represented to the Czar,
that in countries where Surgery was studied, they
had skeletons for the pllrpose of learning the stru~­
ture of the human body ; and thus prond how
atrocious aud absurd it would be to punish a !:.'ur-
geon for having a skeleton in his pusse~sion.
On this sensible representation, the unfortu-
nate Hollander ought certain1y to have been de-
clared innocent, and even recompensed by the
Czar. llut all the grace the flussian gentleman
cou)d obtain for him was, to haYe the punishment

ment. T he 5keleton, how~ver, as being an ac-
complice in the pretended crime of the Surgeon,
was condemned to suffer the pt.nishment to which
it bad been sentenced. It was drawn through the
streets of )loscow and publicly bum\!d.

So ~a: years ago, a skeleton w~s made Ly one
of the first Artists in Loudon, according to an
order rcceiYed from a IIindoo }."abob, dr!:irous of
understanding the stmcture of the human body,
but whose religion prohibited him from touching
any thing formerly possessed of life. It wns
made of willow and pear-tree. and copied with
t crupulous precision from a real skeleton. So ex-
net was the resemblance, that CYcn an auatomi::;t
could not distinguish it irom a real skeleton by
the eye alone. On bn.udliug it, the lightness

hundred guineas, not more than a fair compensa-
tion for the great labour and ingenuity exhibited
in this curious piece of mechanism.
TuE celebrated Yesalius being at Padua, in the
year 1546, superintending a new edition of his
works, profited by the leiiure his stay in that city
afforded him, to prepare a human skeleton, (then
a great rarity) which he presented to the College
of Physicians of that city. They receh·ed it with
much gratitude; in proof which, they added the
sub5equent Inscription, which may still be read
over the niche, where the skeleton was formerly
placed.

THE same King, inspecting a regiment of his
Guards one day, was much struck on finding that
82 of the men had received their discharge on
account of being ruptured. He immediately said,
" I will present a thousand pounds to any person,
who shall discover a remedy for this so frequent
a disease." A Surgeon, encouraged by His ~Ia­
jesty's promise, confined himself solely to this
branch of the healing art, with a view to disco,·cr
a remedy. After two years of research and la-
bour, he found he had not attained his end; aud
he resoh·ed, rather to acknowledge his failure,
than to expose men to 1111certain and perhaps dan-
gerous experiments. This did not prevent the King
from presenting him with five hundred pounds as
a recompence for his zeal and industry. It would

NATU n.E, according to a celebrated author, is
a Divinity whom the whole ,-.,·orld worships; loYe
is her temple; her festivals and feasts are every
day repeated. The incense which burns upon her
altars, the same ingenious writer compares to a
powerful narcotic, which, producing a voluptuous
repose, tcnninates the banquet. To come a little
nearer our own subject, we would say, that when
a patient trusts all to Nature, he hazards too
much; when he leaves all to the Physician, does
he not sometimes risque enn more. " For my

had in eRect a delicacy of nerves unequalled ;
any !ritle wounded him : the sun, the evening
dew, heat, cold, or the least intemperance, af-
fected his constitution; he could drink nothing
but water, an<;l that only of a water it was neces-
sary to fetch from a great distance, and to select,
in a manner of speaking, drop by drop. His
table was provided with vases of silver gilt,
filled 'vith essences, perfumes;- &c. and in which
there were gloves and_fans for his guests. The
Mn.r~rhal d'.-\ ncre was his principal protector at
the Court ; and Yassor says, in his History of
Louis XIII. that the King, having thought htm-
self <!.ttacked by the Yapours, all_ the court, and
the very citizens, believed themselves attacked by
the same: however, the Commentator on Des-
preaux: assures us, in his notes on the eighth
Satire of this celebratd Poet, that at the time
when it was ·composed, women only complained
of having the Vapours. However, the following
fact seems to prove the contrary :
The Comte de Bussy, being one day at the
Petitt::s- ~laisons (Paris Bedlam), found in the
court a man who appeared to him less foolish
than the others : be asked him, what was the
madness of the most part of the people who were
there? " .lnth:ed, Sir, replied this man, it is a
ZOo ANE.CDOT£S.
Yt>ry little mattt>r: they set us down fc,r madmen
because we are poor; if we were people of qua-
lity, they would only say we· had the Vapours,
and would allow us to be at large."
" The man the most a prey to the Vapours
that I ever knew," says a modem author (l'Abb(!
Leblanc, Lettres sur les Anglois, tom. i. let. '.!.7),
" had violent fits only when he had no mont:y.
Ilis disorder augmented or diminished according
as his- purse was more or less empty: it was an
infallible thermometer of his disorder. Just he-
fore tl1e strongest attack he ever bad, he lost two
hundred guineas at Pharo."
l\1. Poi\UIE, n Physician, has written, with
succ<>ss and elegance, on this disease. Ilis work
contains e'cry thing of worth on this matter.
IIowenr, with all his talent, .:\1. Pomme erred
in the treatment of the malady he has so well
descrtbed; of which we may judge, by the extract
of a letter from one of his patients, whom he had
treated during four years am.l five months both by
letter and by personal attendance. " I have kept,"
says the patient, " an ~xact journal of all that l
have done and taken during this long space of
t ime; and the result is, that I have drunk 15000
pints of veal and chicken broth, and u.oo pints
of milk and water; that 1 baH taken 12000 lo-

same state, and I am so still. I am continually
dying, without ceasing to live. Ilad I thought
myself master of my life, I would long ago have
ceased to be dying/'
What does this letter prove ? K othing ; un-
less that, if the Physician did not cur~ his patient,
it was the fault not of the Physician but of the
disease, which is a Proteus, disguising and trans-
forming itself in a thousand different appearances,
in such a manner that it may be compared to a
Hydra., whose heads always reviving, spring up
afresh in proportion as they arc knocked down~

THE :\Jarqnis de Lionne had a 'Yen upon his
right arm. In January, 1731, be put himself
under the care of a Ferrier, who had obtained a
reputation for the cure of these kind of tumors.
He first attempted to discuss it, bt.t this only
tended to render the tumor more painful : ami the
caustics which be afterwards employed, causing
the most excruciating pain, reduced the patient
to the last extremity. ~Ir. Faget, )lessrs. Syh·a
and Petit, were then consulted. They unani-
mously agreed. that extirpation was the sole
means of saving the patient. The operation was
performed by )lr. Faget with complete success.

of concealing a Wen which grew upon her neck.
Ix the ~lcmoirs of the Academy of Sciences
for the year 1728, mention is made of a very
extraordinary \Yen, by a Dr. Guisard. In 1724,
this Wen occupied the whole extent of the thigh
from the hip to the knee, and resembled the
crowns of two hats joined together. In 1727, it
had increased so much, that the patient could no
longer walk. It then weighed forty pounds. At
length it burst, and by degrees all the cysts
(probably hydatids) it contained were disclJarg-
ed, so that by the 8th of August it was quiti
empty. The thigh- bone was exposed for a
considerable lcngt.h, although apparently quite
healthy. The patient, howeyer, died in a short
time, apparently of mere debility, accompanied
with frequent fainting tits.
TuE celebrated 1\Ir. JoiiN IIUNT£n. obtained
great celebrity, in early life, by removing a large
".en from the ueck ; an operation which some of
his contemporaries had dccbred, rather rashly,
none but u. fool or a madman would attempt. The
patient, however, got perfectly well. The tu-

other fluids had exuded, weighed nine pounds.
J.ort.s BEYIG-strs \\'r~sLow, the greatest
anatomist of his age, was born in Sweden. He
was a zeah,us Lutheran. It is singular, that
some conferences which he held with his col-
league Yan Worm, in order to confirm himself
in the faith, tended, on the contrary, to incline
him to catholicism. Entering the shop of a book-
seller, with a view to purchase Rohault's Phy-
sicks, the Illustration of the Doctrine of the
Church, by the illustrious Bossuet, fell into his
hands. He read it with so much attention, as
to make him doubt of the solidity of the faith he
profesicd. lie resoh·ed to consult the Bishop of
l\Ieaux; and with this view repaired to his coun-
try house at Germigny. The oracle of the Gal-
lic church succeeded so completely in dissipating
hii doubts, that he determined to make his abju-
ration between hi's hands. The same prelate had,

to be in his last agony, they take a dog, aml
briug his mouth close to that of the dying person,
so as to inhale his last breath. This appears to
be some modification of the Pythagorean metem·
psychosis.
I~ China, when a sick person is despaired of,
aud he is not expected to live, it is customary to
present to him an image of the Devil, holding in
one hand the sun, and in the other a poignard.
Authors have not told us the import of this cere-
mony.-In some places, the son of the dying
person takes off his cap, and presents himself,
with scattered hair, before the eyes of his dying
parent; l1e then tears in pieces the curtains and
coverings of the bed, and throws the shreds upon
the body.- Another custom, not less singular,
pren.tils in China: The moment a person expires,
his next of kin seizes his robe, and, mounting the
top of the house, displays it towards the north,
callin~ loudly three times on the name of the de-

runct; then turning towards the south, he repeats
the same ceremony.
TIIE inhabitants of Socotora do not wait till a
person has rendered his last breath; they considet
it as bestowing a great fa.vour, to prevent the
sufferings connected with the act of dying. If
they consider a persl)n as past all hopes of reco·
Yery, they pour a white liquor, which exudes
from a tree gro,ving on the island, down his
throat, that extinguishes life; after which the
body is immedia.tely committed to the grave:
and, what is more extraordinary, the sick fre-
• quently beseech their relations tlllis to abridge
their sutfering~.-The inhabitants of the kingdom
()f Congo act nearly in a similar manner: their
belief that death is the greatest blessing which
can befal a man, induces them, when they see a
person struggl:ng with death, to throw themselves
upon him hke madmen, to press upon the breast,
obstruct re5pir:ttion, and overwhelm them with
blows, to accele!'a.te their passage, as they say,
to a happier place.

great agony, for the nearest relations to con::.ider
it as their duty to put them out of their pain, ns
they tcnn:d it; for which purpose they used
means not nry dis5imilnr to the abo\·c.
I~ Cochin-China, when a person is supposed
to be dying, his friends and relations seize thc•ir
arms, and assemble round his bed: they flourish
their sabres, striking and rutting at the air; and
they think that by this means they pren~nt the
approach of the evil demons.
A.:\rO~G the Ligans, when the chief of a dis-
trict is supposed to Le in his last agony, they
~trew odoriferous herbs over the floor or the
chamber; when twelve youths and twelve maids
enter; and, at a given signal, each of these
couples do their best to produce an embryo, in
order that the soul of the dying chief, in quitting
his body, may find another rf'ceptacle ready, and
not be under the necessity of wandering long.-
This must be considered as a very exrcllent
as well as pleasant precaution.

countries nearer the Equator, these e\acuations
are fi!r more profuse than towards the Poles.

..-ery powerful at the Equator, and gradually suiJ.

on the influence of that planet.

TnE chief source of the magical operations of
the ~Iexican priests was an Ointment, composed
of the fat of a variety of poisonous animals, with
some other ingredients, as resin, soot, and par-
ticularly an herb possessing the mischievous power
of deranging the intellects. To prepare this oint-
ment, they collect a variety of venomous animab,

which ·they burn befort! their idols. Their cln•
ders, beaten in a mortar with tobacco and the
p0isonous ingredients already mentionerl, consti~
tut~ this wonderful ointment, which they entitle
the food or nouri::.hment of the Gods. By the use
of this composition, they prdeml to obtain an
intercourse with d~mons, to be able to ~ure all
manner of dise-ases, and even to tame lions, bears,
and other ferocious animals.
Ix the account, given by the Abbe de laPorte,
of .-\nn Zinga, Qneen of Angola? a barbarous and
ferocious princess, he says, being persuaded by one
of her Sa:;gas, or priests, that he knew how to com-
pose a wondaCul ointment of the flesh and bon.es
of a male child beJtcn to~etber in a mortar, which
would give great ~trength, and even render a
person invul11erable: She assembled the people
one tl.Ly, and publicly slew a child two years old,
whom :,he had adoped ; be.1t the body in a mor~
tar together with acertain powder, thus composing
?- mysterious paste; and 5tripping her~elf quite
nak<'d, she anointed her body with thb horrible
composition.

or " Ladies' GuaTd,', because, as they think, it
has the effect of preserving their chastity, which it
thus effects:- In Navarette's Collection of Voy-
ages, It is stated, that the Emperors of China
are accustomed to rub the palms of the hands of
their concubines with an ointment composed of
the flesh of this lizard The ointment imprints a
mark, which is indelible while they continue
chaste, but which vanishes the moment they are
guilty of any breach of their honour. Perhaps it
may contribute to tht! domestic tranquillity of
married people in more northern countries, that
our lizards are destitute of any such virtue.

PRESCRIPTIONS.
TRILLF.R relates, that a Physician of his ac·
quaiutance always had his pocket filled with reci-
pes of all kinds. lVben consulted, he desired the
patients to draw one forth by chance, assuring
them that the lot they drew, would infalliby an·

she put her hand in his pocket, and perceiving
she bad drawn a prescription for a clyster. she
was seized with so violent a fit of laughing, that
an abscess in her lungs broke ; and from that
moment she rapidly recovered.
TnE celebrated Dr. Hugh Smith bad, at one
time, his prescriptions engraved, leaving blanks
for the quantities of the ingredients. But this being
discovered by some of the patients comparing tbeir
prt-scriptions, very nearly deprived the Doctor of
his business, great as his reputation then was.
At one time, the same Gentleman took a Phy.

PURPLES.
Occasxo~ ALLY, after death, the body is c.:>•
wred with large red blotches, whtch are Yulgarly
termed purples,and it is therefore often alleged that
the Physician had mistaken the disease, as the pa-
tient died of the purples, which manifested them•
seh·es after death. These spots are, in fact, only
the dissolved blood stagnating in the small vessels.
I-s- the History of the Academy of Science!
there is a singular case of epidemic purples, com-
bined with worms, which occurred in Lorraine.
When the sick were properly treated, a numbe1
of worms were discharged, and the purple eru~
tion made its appearance. Th~e who recovered,
lost the whole epidermis; others died within three
days of the attack, and the bodies became so
quickly putrid, that those employed to bury them
frequently caught the contagi()n.
A SPECIES of Purples occurs in China, which
is cured in the following strange manner:-They
dip the pith of a rush io oil, which they set on
iire, and apply the flame in succession to the
spots. The skin cracks, with a kind of snapping

that, a little before he died, he read tlJe 20th or

IT is said that St. Ph:llip, of Neri, was so
iuflamt>d by di\'ine love, that two of his ribs
were absolutely displaced by the violeut agita-
tion of his heart; a circumsto.nre very evident
after his death. Supposing this anecdote to be
true, it was most likely owing to an enlargement
<Ji the heart~ or an aneurism of the aorta, in

consequence of which not only the ribs, but even
the scapul~, are occasionally absorbed .or dis-
placed.
ST. AuGUSTI~ is of opinion, that God never
restored to Adam the part employed in the form-
ation of Eve, and that our first parent continued
deficieut in a rib. On this Voltaire obsen-es, it
must probably haw~ been one of the false ribs,
as the loss of a true rib must have been attended
with incom·enience. Perhaps, however, the whole
is symbolic of the intimate union that ought to
t xist between man and·wife.- Persons in whom a.
rib is found wanting, ha•;e been therefore termed
Adamites.
A YOU'!\G man, who hardly ever quitted the
side of a young lady to whom be was very much
attached, obser;ed to a friend, who joked him on
the subject, " I seek, like a true son of Adam,
the rib that belongs to me ; for I am well as-

PROPHYLACTICS.
TnE wann glow of action which terminates
&he fourth book of the Iliad, hu been an object
of admiration in all ages. The ancients thought
so highly of it, that, by way of metaphor, they
used to say it possessed heat enough to cure a
tertian fever. Superstition, which believes every
thing according to the very letter, converted thi8
simile into a real remedy for that disease. Sere-
nus Samonicus, who wrote Principles of Medicine
in Latin verse, which are frequently bound up
with editions of Celsus, and who was Physician
to the Emperor Gordian, has seriously promul·
gated this as a medical remedy. For the cure of
a tertian fever, he orders the fourth book of the
Iliad to be o.pplied to the head of the patient.-
This observation furnishes an additional proof,
that there is nothing so absurd, or so ridiculous,
which has not, at some time or other, been
published by _
the learned : a reflection which, o.s
Pope obsen·es, may help to humiliate one clasa of
mankind, aml console another.

discover a meaning in that which has none.
Debrio also mentions itas a magical formula. The
age in which we live is too enlightened to be im-
posed upon by such chimeras; but it is well to
guard the credulous against similar follies. The
