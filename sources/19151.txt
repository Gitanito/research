i have a lot of friends here
i won&#39;t criticize my friends but to
support their thigh
why do they do this it&#39;s beyond my
comprehension they don&#39;t have to do this
the people want to know the truth the
young people want young kids
to give them the truth so that&#39;s the
answer these are
another intelligence they&#39;re ahead of us
they&#39;ve proven it
and only one simple reason they can fly
in space and we can&#39;t
so it boils down to that simple how
you&#39;re going to overcome that you got us
we don&#39;t know anything about how so we
got to start with what we know
all we know is the greatest gift they
gave us
not the hardware
i wasn&#39;t at roswell in 47 47 i just come
back from italy
i&#39;ve been chief of security intelligence
in rome and in the intelligence business
i was trained really by the british i
was in mi19
so when i came back i went to for
fort alley kansas i was stationed there
it was a
veterinarian personal and then we had
still had horses
and i was instructor at the intelligence
school and we had an aggressive force we
that i was
so one night i was close to the officer
opposed to the officer means that i was
in control for that night
i was the one that checked all the
guards checked all security areas
fact checked the whole post i was a duty
officer that night
and i went to the veterinarian section
and one of
a sergeant i knew very well was sergeant
of the guard that night
i told sarge how&#39;s everything around
here and he said fine sir
i told you they told me to be careful to
watch this area because you have a sense
of something sensitive here
he said you want to see it sir tell me
let&#39;s go look
and i knew this sergeant very master
sergeant i went back and
there was five crates there like
five or six i think it was five i lifted
one up and here&#39;s this body there in
floating and fluid
and i looked at it about
10-15 seconds not much more than that so
i put it
back down and says sarge come on get out
of here now i want to get you in trouble
because i&#39;m the duty officer i can go
around walk around here
but you might get in trouble for coming
back just come on let&#39;s go
come out with me so we went out
and i told him where did it come from
sarge he said there were five trucks
games
are coming through here from an airfield
in in new mexico and they&#39;re heading for
right patterson air force
now in those days young there want all
these big
roads now in those days rod 40 was about
the only cross country route
and the route that they took was route
40 going through fort raleigh kansas
and then up the right patterson air
force and i said well
stay away from the sergeant i don&#39;t want
you to get in any trouble i told them i
can walk around and see
so and i started to figure what was that
first i thought it was a child because
it was small
then i looked at this head and all right
and this was only happened a matter of
seconds
then i put the end back down
and uh the head was different the arms
were spindly
the body it was gray so
right oh i figured i don&#39;t know what
this thing is
so like an intelligence business i just
better put it in the back of my head
here
and wait to maybe in the future i get
collaboration
so i can evaluate what it is so i
promptly forgot about it
ten years later i was down there
commanded the range in new mexico
in white sands the army and missile fine
range
in northern right near trinity site my
headquarters was
on my own radar start picking up items
going three four thousand miles an hour
in this area
i had pencil beam radars which locked on
a target
and the boys told me about three or four
thousand miles an hour quick
acceleration they break the lock
and that was one of the best radars we
had during the time
so every time that would happen once i
notified our headquarters he said
i&#39;ll forget it we&#39;re not interested so i
figured i won&#39;t tell them anything
anymore
so i uh every time that would happen i
tell the boys bring me the tapes
because all my computers and my fine had
a tape which
gave the whole fine sequence and we
could check it after if anything went
wrong
so i think i don&#39;t deliver the tapes to
me personally and i&#39;d look them over
and yet what they told me was true
then i left and went to germany and i
started picking up the same
thing in germany three four thousand
miles over flying germany
again the pencil beam radar would lock
on
and all one that walk would break just
before that i was four years at the
white house
and i kept getting reports there but
they were just reports
i mean and like they weren&#39;t actually
cast in any sense that you put them in a
file and keep them all together they
just responded reports came through
of course i had all the clearances so
i&#39;d get them even code reports i used to
get no
and i did get one time report that nsa
was getting signals from space which
were not just space noise or
you know or unscrambled or something you
couldn&#39;t read they were
they were really very perfect
and look like something was guiding him
there was a real message
we were never able to decode it this was
a a very coordinated
message it wasn&#39;t space noise or jam or
jumble mumble or anything like that
or just noise coming it was a pattern
so the valuation it might come from
outer space some
beans and i got that airport that
reported at the white house because i
had the nsa clearances and all
and when i came back you know trudeau
pulled me and he had reorganized
a research and developed from a
secondary mission logistics
to a very compact good unit about three
thousand officers was too compact
and then i went first when i reported
then i was a special assistant
then he created the foreign technology
division about a week later and put me
in charge of it
there i started getting the tosser
reports i started getting other crash
reports the artifacts i got
and by that time i established and i
visited
the site here but in when i came to
research and developed which was 14
years later by the way
i inherited all these artifacts and i
inherited the
reports autopsy reports from walter reed
hospital now walter reed there was a
laboratory there which was our
laboratory and we financed that&#39;s who
did the topsies for us
but we didn&#39;t leave any copies there all
copies had to come back to us
because after it was our lab we financed
it all
so there i started to get an indication
proof that a crash really happened here
of course then i kept that clause for 35
years i had to post with the general
and i didn&#39;t reveal the names of people
even he criticized me
so 35 years you kept a secret didn&#39;t
even tell your family i thought why
should i tell anybody
no the general told me he said phil you
let&#39;s keep a secret when i die though i
relieve you of my own three years ago
the general died
and i started putting all this on paper
my grandchildren said what&#39;d you do
during the war said i better leave them
a legacy
really i had no intention of writing a
book being in the military like that
but finally it evolved and gradually
moved out i started to write
and it evolved into this finally so
that&#39;s the background
my background and i as i say i had the
evidence
that that a crash did happen here
and where did it happen the site that i
went to the other day was cnn
because that&#39;s what i&#39;ve been to that
site now that&#39;s the fifth time i&#39;ve been
there
the one i saw was and one of the air
bases
yeah i&#39;m not going to say where it was
but it was there
and that was it i didn&#39;t go in it
and i say that i had a lot of
information on what was inside
there was nothing i could gain by going
inside and looking at it i had the
drawings out looked inside
i had what was in there and really
to go in that have been curiosity and
in those days i didn&#39;t have the time for
your curiosity wheeler smith
is really the man that first put in my
mind
when nuclear binding coming apart on
things and he was a magnetic you know
really he was a genius and the king
government really treated him bad
you know and then i was supposed to go
to his laboratory visiting because the
general told me when his uh
the general told him you know smith he
said you know colonel i have a lot to
talk about i&#39;ll let the colonel come up
and
visit you at your lab on mayber on lake
ontario
well i put it off put it off 1962 i
decided to go up i called up
and then they told me mrs smith died of
cancer i never really got to go to his
laboratory
but he uh he gave us a piece of metal
that he took from a flying saucer you
exchanged we exchanged and he brought
ours back
later let&#39;s ask you one last thing if
you
uh only had a moment to speak in open
congressional hearings
to discuss what happened 50 years ago
what would you say
i say it happened and i died onto that
give us information to the young people
of the world in this country
they want to hear it they want it give
it to them don&#39;t hide it and tell lies
and make stories
they&#39;re not stupid they&#39;re not young men
that&#39;ll
panic in fact my own nephew is the
research director
of deco corporation he tells me his
uncle phil one day tells the truth we&#39;re
not gonna panic and pull our hair out
and one good example of this which i
always tell
the to prove this point that the young
people will want it and they&#39;re not
gonna panic
they want to hear this and that&#39;s one of
the reasons i wrote this even my own
grandchildren now will see it
and i always prove it this way i
commanded the battalion of 1500 men
combat battalion average age of my
soldiers was 19 and a half years old
i told my exec one day my god maine were
sending babies into battle
these kids they fought the greatest
armies in the world
they didn&#39;t run they didn&#39;t panic they
stood there and fought
and i i don&#39;t why do you think they&#39;ll
pay they want this information
they deserve it it&#39;s their information
it doesn&#39;t belong to the army of the
department of defense
it&#39;s theirs if it&#39;s classified take the
classification off and give it to them
who&#39;s covering it up now is there any
one organization i always say this now
here&#39;s what i say
the government is so big and so vast
that if you leave it alone it&#39;ll cover
itself up
when i had a i testified in front of
missing prisoners of war in front of
congress the senate and later not too
long ago from the house
and they asked me a question like this
and i told them look you know what
amazes me
when a schoolcraft a general stroke and
a kissinger can come up here in front of
you gentlemen
and say there&#39;s no information there i
sent myself from tokyo over
teleconference over two year period
how can i say that and all the families
were sitting there
and they wanted to hear this see later
on
we searched for we found it it had
fallen through the cracks the
politicians didn&#39;t care
they want their own little bailwick
their own little eagle and do their own
little job to get in the newspapers
if if a family if a person&#39;s worth
missing from families they don&#39;t care
and i brought this out when i testified
and
the cover-up happens like that sometimes
with nobody doing anything it&#39;ll cover
itself
up and fall through the cracks as i put
it and
we never trusted cia because
in my day stalin gave orders to get this
information that came out of roswell
to some of his top scientists and agents
that order went out
and we knew that in the special
intelligence that i was in the pentagon
which was very closely held
kgb trying to penetrate that but they
never did
and we knew that stalin they send agents
out all over this area here
to try to get information on roswell and
yet we stood back like fools and said it
didn&#39;t exist
it was a weather balloon they didn&#39;t
think it was a weather balloon countries
in europe are taking this very seriously
not like us here they&#39;re not going to
put out stories that their dummies came
out of the air
or people with big heads those people
are more serious about this than we are
but around here you know i&#39;m even
surprised to see the reaction from these
people
because somebody like me had never been
out like this you know and
after being in the middle you don&#39;t go
out and give interviews and
and write books and things like because
we gave when we gave the information out
we gave it out and
and insisted they take the patents but
also we put a little bit of a
requirement on that requirement feed it
back to us
for the competitive edge of the army
take the patents make all the money you
want but give it to the american people
and give it to the world if
the japanese they interviewed me and i
told when we put the integrated circuit
out
we also gave it to you i&#39;ve testified in
front of six
congressional committees um if they want
me to
providing is serious and they&#39;re not
going to put in the archives
and just put it away and when i went to
robert kennedy out this is a provision i
put on i would testify about four years
to white house
that something is done with it not just
congress sitting up here for publicity
purpose
i&#39;ll go any time they want to
there&#39;s no no hitch on me and i&#39;ll tell
them enter anything they
want providing they&#39;re serious i won&#39;t
go up and
have help with senator congressman get
elected look there&#39;s a lot of stupidity
involved let&#39;s face it
maybe mine was a little stupid i kept it
quite so long but i had notes with the
general
that i wasn&#39;t going to talk to he died
three years ago
and and also other people involved and
like i told you before i couldn&#39;t take
i don&#39;t reveal them unless they want to
come forward these bills
there&#39;s enough electromagnetism in this
world or it can draw
so the extraterrestrial is a little
different
he&#39;s composed in a way of cells also
like
humans are this structure has some
metallic surroundings so they have to
survive in space
from debris in space which keeps
striking it constantly
it&#39;ll knock holes in it so there&#39;s a
little different strength there that
will last a few more years
it is really almost
a biological type of biological
structure because
the extra ratio fits in it but made with
a little more strength
that&#39;s needed in the extra remember
these cloners that made these things
made them in a way where they would fit
in what they wanted to fit in
there the ship itself is maybe a
biological type structure because of the
cell and the atom structure
but it&#39;s all created with more strength
because it has to resist more
this being is protecting the way now
when this being comes in this world
he will wear a suit skin tight suit
which we found
his skin is atomically aligned and his
suit is atomically aligned
that&#39;s to repel radiation and harmful
effects even cosmic action
since he doesn&#39;t breathe air
the ones that come alive on in this
world will have a type of helmet on
and since he doesn&#39;t speak he has no
vocal cords
he will have something that intensifies
a transmission
that he maybe can communicate well the
body
the head really wasn&#39;t that big but in
portions of the body a small body it
looked big
in the eyes there are no nose or
anything like that
had spindly legs so that was about it
because i didn&#39;t have any toxins
and i just put it off because i figured
well maybe someday i&#39;ll get
collaboration
and be able to evaluate later i got my
hands on the autopsy report
in 1961 when i took charge of foreign
technology division
from walter reed hospital our own
laboratory
so there i start putting it all together
what did you read in the autopsy reports
well the nature of the body inside
because before that i never knew that
they did an autopsy and they cut it open
all
the brain and all and the brain was
different
and a lot of the and most of the body
was different but
no nose no mouth no ears
it no vocal cords no digestive system
no sex organs
so then we came conclusion it was a
humanoid clone
so that&#39;s and as i say i was
when i saw the body there was nothing
else to go on later on
i got the autopsy reports that experts
had done
our own experts this question better
part of valor we
just kept it ourselves only some certain
people knew about it
head to head brain the brain no paper
trail
and we were able to accomplish something
now discussions with the
german scientists they we had
discussions general trudeau told me
one day it took us five years to develop
fully develop a transistor that somebody
else started
and the integrated circuit
if we didn&#39;t have the help like albert
says that we&#39;ve been helped and and
smith said the boy&#39;s upstairs it would
have
generally said it would have taken us
250 years the message in my book that i
like to see is that the younger
generation look at this
and see what we did and see the help we
got from outer space and these beings
exist
and let the young people know that
that&#39;s the future that they&#39;re going to
be seeing and live with and you&#39;ve got a
good example
mitchell already confirmed a lot of this
that&#39;s what i think the message of the
book is and what i like to see it do
let the young one people we&#39;re old we&#39;re
going to be gone
let those young people they need this
help they&#39;re going to be the ones that
carry it on
it&#39;s been right only through our
stupidity we didn&#39;t do it
right now it&#39;s coming out and look how
it&#39;s snowballing
the general public is not stupid or dumb
they can recognize a lie or the truth
give them the truth i&#39;m trying to tell
the younger people
this is it not people like me i&#39;m 82
years old what&#39;s going to make them
but these young these three my little
grandchildren they got to know this
they&#39;re going to be
living this in the future let them know
how it started
where the seed came from intentional or
unintentional doesn&#39;t matter
it came that&#39;s all whether they gave it
to us or not is not important
we got it we had it whether they gave it
to us intentionally
or it was a mistake or something that
doesn&#39;t matter
we didn&#39;t really operate as a family
unit
being open about our feelings everything
was kept a secret and so that was
carried on
you know even my mother you know um and
so it affected us as
as human beings and it you know when i
graduated
school it was very difficult to interact
with people because i felt
i felt that there
