  		              		Experience Description   

    The midterm holiday had just started.  I packed my bags and happily left for my hometown. However, I was worried about my health because of  sudden weight loss.  I intended to go meet a doctor for a check-up. I  finally met a doctor and got  some  testing done. I needed to do some tests with an empty stomach or  eat lightly  the day before the test. So, I hadn't eaten much the day before the test and I had nothing to eat on the morning testing.  

  A young nurse came to take the blood sample but couldn’t take it from my left hand. When she failed, I saw the blood and felt like fainting. Then she tried my right hand and again failed to take get a blood  sample. I  felt even more  sick by seeing more of my blood. The nurse decided to try my left hand again. This time she found  a good vein in the back of my left arm. I  knew it would hurt more to take the sample from that part of my arm. But the nurse assured me  not to worry. 

  As soon as the needle went into my arm, I lost my eyesight and couldn’t talk. Then, I lost all senses but hearing. I was in a dark place and there was a tiny light; almost a mix of yellow and orange. I could hear the nurse calling and shaking me. She was calling to her colleagues to help. But I was still in that dark place. I had a neutral feeling that was neither  good nor bad. I couldn’t feel  my feet. As I was getting closer to that light and getting used to the darkness, I suddenly felt  a pain in the back of my hand due to the needle and my eyes were open again. I saw a few nurses and the supervisor of the lab. It was obvious they were really scared.

Date NDE Occurred:   	 Persian Date: 1395  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Uncertain.           Life threatening event, but not clinical death   
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Both pleasant AND distressing  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes.    I clearly left my body and existed outside it  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?   More consciousness and alertness than normal. I felt so light and unaware. I was just going toward the light without free will.  
  
  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         When  I was running to the light and  doing my best to reach to it.  
  
Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     It was like I was shot into the sky and  immediately running to the light. I did not  not care at all about the surroundings.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I had lost my physical eyesight. But when I entered the darkness, I could see the light.  

  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I couldn’t hear anything. The experience was finished soon. And so far I remember, I couldn’t hear anything in that dark place.  
  
Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, but the facts have not been checked out  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain.     I was in a place without any structure or borders. It was an absolute darkness with a light at the far end. I can’t call it a tunnel.  
  
Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         No  

  Did you see an unearthly light?         Uncertain.   I don’t know. The only thing I saw was a tiny orange particle that got bigger and more yellow as I got closer to it.  
  
  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         Some unfamiliar and strange place.     The darkness in that place was so deep, that I was scared and happy at the same time. It was absolutely different from the darkness in this world.

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Other or several faiths.   Shia Muslim  
  
  Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Uncertain.     I feel God closer to myself more than ever.  
  
What is your religion now?         Christian- Protestant     

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I have never felt the kind of love I had during my experience in my lifetime on earth.  I had never felt so much rush in getting something like how I felt when I was trying to reach the light. I've had hard times in my life and so many worries that made me feel very bad and engaged my soul, mind and body for awhile with bitterness. But this experience and that dark were unique.The fear I had at the time I entered the darkness is not comparable to the fears and worries of this world.  
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Uncertain.     Now I have more faith in God.  
  
Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.          I didn’t hear specific sounds telling me that I  entered into another world. But I felt like I must reach the light and If I could, then  good things would happen to me.

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Uncertain.     I was feeling pretty good. When I entered the darkness, I was scared of so much darkness.  But when I saw the light, the fear was gone. As I got closer to the light, I felt some feeling like love to the light more and more.

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Uncertain.  I was completely confused after I was back and I felt something important had happened to me.  I had to ask other people why I failed to reach that light. But then I remembered all that happened because of the test and I thought maybe it was normal. So, I didn’t talk to others about it.
