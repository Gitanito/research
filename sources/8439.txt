  			My grandmother died in February 2010. My grandfather and she had been together for over 75 years. Yes, that’s right – my grandfather is 95 years old and still alive. He was pretty devastated when grandma passed over and felt like a part of him died last March.

  			Much to my surprise, my grandfather admitted to me that he had several after death communications (ADCs) from her. He said he could feel her presence, she appeared in dreams, and sometimes she talked to him. He also told me that he was interested in the near death experience (NDE) and would like to read some of the experiences. So, I copied over 500 pages in large print so he could see it, put it into a couple of 4” D-ring binders, and sent them to him.

  			What started as a kernel of an idea - to make reading NDEs more accessible to those who don’t have access to a computer, germinated so everyone can read a book of these precious outcrops containing stories of love and hope.

  			&quot;Evidence   			of the Afterlife&quot; presents evidence of an afterlife and shares   			firsthand accounts of those people who have died and lived to tell   			about it. Through their work at the Near Death Experience Research   			Foundation, radiation oncologist Jeffrey Long and his wife Jody have   			gathered thousands of accounts of near death experiences (NDE) from   			all over the world. In addition to sharing the personal narrative of   			their experience, visitors to the website are asked to fill out a   			100 item questionnaire designed to isolate specific elements of the   			experience and to red flag counterfeit accounts. Currently the   			database contains over 2000 legitimate NDE accounts, far more than   			any other NDE research database in the world. The people whose   			stories are captured in the database span all age groups, races, and   			religious affiliations and come from all over the world, yet the   			similarities in their stories are as awe-inspiring as they are   			inexplicable.  			                                  Jody's   			Book, &quot;From Soul to Soulmate&quot; What is a Soulmate and how do you find   			yours?

  			Divine Moments: Ordinary People Having Spiritually Transformative Experiences, by Nancy Clark,&nbsp;   			  			  			Marvelous review by Ken Ring&nbsp; Click Here. Nancy Clark's life was transformed forever by a near-death and a near-death-like experience that resulted in her passion to show us that humans can experience the reality of their true, authentic self - the self that is rooted in the divine and brimming with love for all humanity. She has been researching spiritually transformative experiences for thirty years and now in this groundbreaking book, she has compiled diverse spiritually transformative experiences happening to ordinary people today. The experiences are varied and include near-death and near-death-like experiences, out-of-body experiences, after-death communications, spiritual awakenings, religious conversion experiences, meditative and prayerful experiences, and mystical experiences. ? Learn how these individuals awakened to a new understanding of their deepest assumptions about the eternal questions: Why am I here? Where am I going? What is the purpose of life? ? Learn how their inner wisdom can assist all of us in understanding that we are more than biological beings; we are spirits of consciousness that are gifted with a love born of our divine nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  			I   			Saw God: The True Story of a Young Boy's Miraculous Return from Death, by John   			Anderson.&nbsp; Run over by a car when he was five years old, Billy Anderson died three times before his  emergency surgery. The doctors said he wouldn't survive ' he had retreated to a vegetative  state, and large portions of his brain had to be removed. Six days later, he was miraculously  healed, and told his parents of his visits to heaven. Over the years, Billy gradually lost these  memories, but with the help of a clinical hypnotherapist, Billy's memories of his extraordinary  journey, and his encounters with Jesus, were brought back into the open by his brother Jim in  his book, I Saw God: The True Story of a Young Boy's Miraculous Return from Death. This true  story is a testament to what we all hope for at the end of our lives, and an amazing opportunity  to learn what it's like to be in the physical presence of Jesus.

  			The Man who Planted Trees    			, by Jim Robbins.&nbsp;   			
  			'When is the best time to plant a tree? Twenty years ago. The second   			best time? Today.''Chinese proverb&nbsp; &nbsp;
  			Twenty years ago, David Milarch, a northern Michigan nurseryman with   			a penchant for hard living, had a vision: angels came to tell him   			that the earth was in trouble. Its trees were dying, and without   			them, human life was in jeopardy. The solution, they told him, was   			to clone the champion trees of the world'the largest, the hardiest,   			the ones that had survived millennia and were most resilient to   			climate change'and create a kind of Noah's ark of tree genetics.   			Without knowing if the message had any basis in science, or why he'd   			been chosen for this task, Milarch began his mission of cloning the   			world's great trees. Many scientists and tree experts told him it   			couldn't be done, but, twenty years later, his team has successfully   			cloned some of the world's oldest trees'among them giant redwoods   			and sequoias. They have also grown seedlings from the oldest tree in   			the world, the bristlecone pine Methuselah.

  			  			  The   			Truth in the Light    			  			by Peter &amp; Elizabeth Fenwick.&nbsp;    			  			Most of us at the very least wonder   			about our own immortality and many people are convinced that there   			is something beyond death, beyond the blackness of the grave. In   			Western Judaeo-Christian culture we absorb from an early age the   			idea that virtue now has its own reward - later. We are taught that   			the universe is essentially moral and that there are absolute human   			values. But increasingly, science presents us with a picture of a   			much more mechanical universe in which there is no absolute morality   			and man has no purpose and no personal responsibility except to his   			culture and his biology.&nbsp;  &nbsp;We   			no longer live in an age when faith is sufficient; we demand data,   			and we are driven by data. And it is data - data that apparently   			throws some light on our current concepts of Heaven and Hell - that   			the near-death experience seems to offer. The near-death experience   			(NDE) is intriguing for two major reasons. First, it is very common   			and secondly, it is cross-cultural. The results of one NOP survey in   			America suggest that over 1 million Americans have 'seen the light'.   			Any experience that is so common must have had some influence on the   			way we think about life and death. Indeed, it could be the very   			engine that drives our ideas of an afterlife. Many people believe   			that in the NDE we are given glimpses of Heaven (or Hell). But it is   			just as reasonable to assume that it is the NDE itself which may   			have shaped our very ideas about Heaven and Hell.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

  			Deathbed   			Visions    			  			  			by Sir William Barrett.&nbsp;&nbsp;   			 During his   			50 years of psychical research, Sir William Fletcher Barrett   			(February 10, 1884 - May 26, 1925) observed many types of phenomena.   			In his reminiscences, read at a private meeting of the Society for   			Psychical Research (SPR) on June 17, 1924, less than a year before   			his death, Barrett said: &quot;I am personally convinced that the   			evidence we have published decidedly demonstrates (1) the existence   			of a spiritual world, (2) survival after death, and (3) of   			occasional communication from those who have passed over... It is   			however hardly possible to convey to others who have not had a   			similar experience an adequate idea of the strength and cumulative   			force of the evidence that has compelled [my] belief.&quot; Barrett was   			the prime-mover in the founding of the SPR in 1882, serving as   			vice-president and editor of the Society's Journal during its first   			year and president in 1904. He also encouraged Professor William   			James of Harvard to organize the American branch of the SPR in 1884.   			In this book, Deathbed Visions, first published in 1926, the year   			after his death, Barrett reported on a number of intriguing cases in   			which a dying person appears to see and recognize some deceased   			relative or friend, some of them involving instances where the dying   			person was unaware of the previous death of the spirit form he saw.   			&quot;These cases form, perhaps, one of the most cogent arguments for   			survival after death, as the evidential value and veridical (truth   			telling) character of these visions of the dying is greatly enhanced   			when the fact is undeniably established that the dying person was   			wholly ignorant of the decease of the person he or she so vividly   			sees,&quot; Barrett stated in the book, now something of a classic in the   			field.

  			THE   			(NEAR-) DEATH DECODED    			  			by Drs. Maureen Venselaar -    			  			This   			article describes a complete new and astonishing theory about the   			near-death experience - based on astrophysics -&nbsp; which includes   			ten new features.

&nbsp;

  			Science and the Near-Death Experience: How Consciousness Survives Death  			by Chris Carter.&nbsp;   			Using evidence from scientific studies, quantum mechanics, and   			consciousness research, Carter reveals how consciousness does not   			depend on the brain and may, in fact, survive the death of our   			bodies. Examining ancient and modern accounts of NDEs from around   			the world, including China, India, and tribal societies such as the   			Native American and the Maori, he explains how NDEs provide evidence   			of consciousness surviving the death of our bodies. He looks at the   			many psychological and physiological explanations for NDEs raised by   			skeptics--such as stress, birth memories, or oxygen starvation--and   			clearly shows why each of them fails to truly explain the NDE.   			Exploring the similarities between NDEs and visions experienced   			during actual death and the intersection of physics and   			consciousness, Carter uncovers the truth about mind, matter, and   			life after death.

  			The   			Afterlife Revealed  			by Michael Tymn.&nbsp;   			In &quot;The Afterlife Revealed&quot;, Michael Tymn sets forth some of the   			most credible messages from the spirits relative to the nature of   			their world. Instead of a heaven-hell dichotomy, we are told that   			there are many levels, or as Jesus is quoted, &quot;many mansions,&quot; and   			that we cross over to the &quot;other side&quot; based on what might be called   			a &quot;moral specific gravity.&quot; We discover a Divine plan - one of   			attainment and attunement, of gradual spiritual growth, of evolution   			of spirit through progressively higher planes. We see how we are   			really souls occupying bodies rather than bodies housing souls and   			how our souls are progressing in finding their way back to Oneness   			with the Creator through the challenges, the adversities, the trials   			and tribulations offered us in a particular lifetime.

  			  			  			  			  			IN   			UNEXPECTED PLACES, Death and dying, building up a   			picture&nbsp; by Ray Brown, o-books ISBN 978-1-84694-418-5, April 2011.&nbsp;   			No one religion or religious movement has the monopoly of Truth.   			Truth can&nbsp; be found in all religions and in science - even in other   			places, often unexpectedly. Among those expected and unexpected   			places that his book talks of are age-old African beliefs that speak   			of a body that is not the physical body; an ancient Mesopotamian   			epic which tells a tale of death and immortality; old Tibetan and   			Chinese writings which talk of the importance of nothingness; the   			behavior of electrons separated by vast distances; the tales of   			people who have come back from a death-like experience after a heart   			attack or an accident; a Moslem philosopher of the 12th century who   			ponders the possibility of&nbsp; an afterlife in a non-physical   			environment; the logic and depth of the Kabbala; the mysticism of   			the Upanishads, of Jalal-Ud-Din Rumi and Saint John of the Cross.   			All of these are the matter of this book. And all of them talk, in   			one way or another, of an existence after our death.  
  			
  			  			Live   			From   			The Other Side   			  			by Maureen McGill &amp; Nola Davis.&nbsp;Angel   			books and ghost stories have intrigued readers for years. Live From   			the Other Side is more than stories of visits from Aunt Edna or   			Uncle Roy. It contains real experiences of people who have validated   			this universal connection with deceased loved ones. Included are   			stories about moving towards resolution after death: experiences   			during death watches; visits from deceased family members; visits   			from people who have become messengers. In short these are stories   			about resolving grief and finding ways to become aware of the other   			side. At the same time the content demystifies death and after-life   			experiences.    			  			&nbsp;Also available in Kindle.

  			A Benevolent Virus by Frances   			O'Brien.&nbsp; What happens when we die? And what happens to those   			of us who are propelled into the strange reality of a near death   			experience? How do we re-integrate into the world when our   			understanding of reality has been turned upside-down? A Benevolent   			Virus follows the intertwining stories of two NDE survivors who   			struggle to make sense of their lives in the wake of an NDE. Ann   			Richards, a successful television reporter is faced with the   			breakdown of her marriage and her career as she struggles to get to   			the truth of her experience. Daniel Breton, an ex-Marine who was   			near-fatally injured in Fallujah, tries to find meaning in his NDE   			by recording the stories of others who have had similar experiences.   			Both Ann and Daniel are set on a spiritual adventure that forces   			them each to explore ideas of consciousness and the quantum universe   			that challenge their old worldview.

  			The   			Bartholomew Effect   			Author Larry Vorwerk   			writes about his personal awakening, 'Oneness develops more through   			spiritual maturity and a sincere readiness to explore a deeper   			purpose...'&nbsp; More than a book of experiences, The   			Bartholomew Effect: Awakening to Oneness becomes a foundation   			for 'Oneness in Action.' Not only will you discover your purpose and   			how you are connected in love to all living things, you will want to   			share your newfound awareness with others. The simple, yet profound   			act of sharing lets you see Oneness even more clearly and deepens   			your relationship with the Divine.    I have had other multidimensional   			experiences that would probably be somewhat similar to NDEs. These   			include experiences of Oneness, and life after life, (meaning life   			after being in the cycle of being human.)&nbsp; I describe them in my new   			book: &quot;The Bartholomew Effect: Awakening to Oneness&quot; where you can   			read more about them at my website:   			  			www.awakeningtooneness.com.

  			  			  			  			Making Sense of Near-Death Experiences   			&nbsp;    			by Mahendra Perrera,   			Karuppiah Jagadheesan and Anthony Peake.&nbsp;    			A near-death experience (NDE) is a   			phenomenon whereby powerful physical and emotional sensations and   			visions are experienced by someone who is either close to death or   			has been declared clinically dead. This is an accessible guide to   			the theory and evidence underlying the phenomenon of NDEs. With   			contributions from leading international experts in the field, it   			provides an overview of the research into NDEs, the nature of NDEs   			and how they have been experienced around the world, and the   			physiological, psychological and medical bases of the phenomenon.   			This book also discusses children's NDEs, NDEs from a religious   			perspective, the role of light in NDEs, the assessment and   			management of NDEs, and the future of research into the phenomenon.   			This essential handbook will provide all those who may encounter   			someone who has had an NDE with the knowledge and understanding they   			need, including nurses, doctors, palliative care workers,   			psychologists, psychiatrists and pastoral workers.

  			NDE   			NDE et exp'riences mystiques d'hier et d'aujourd'huiy   			by Danielle Vermeulen.&nbsp;    			L'Exp'rience de Mort   			Imminente (EMI) - ou Near Death Experience (NDE) selon la   			terminologie am'ricaine - est devenue en l'espace de quelques ann'es   			un objet scientifique enfin reconnu. Il n'en a pas 't' toujours   			ainsi dans le monde occidental, pour lequel une approche   			scientifique de la Mort restait taboue. Cet ouvrage, qui a fait   			l'objet d'une th'se d'Anthropologie Sociale et de Sociologie   			Compar'e, s'attache ' 'tudier des r'cits venus d'autres lieux et   			d'autres temps tout en les comparant aux t'moignages contemporains.   			Les outils conceptuels fournis par l'ensemble des sciences humaines   			permettent aujourd'hui d''tudier objectivement les contours de ces   			exp'riences, qu'elles soient contemporaines ou qu'elles aient 't'   			d'crites par les 'gyptiens anciens, les 'das log du Tibet ou les   			mystiques occidentaux du Moyen Age. L'auteur peut ainsi en   			d'terminer la dimension anthropologique et mettre en 'vidence   			l'impact individuel et social que ces exp'riences jouent par la   			suite pour ceux qui les ont v'cues et pour ceux qui s'y int'ressent.   			Sans conteste, atteindre les rivages de la mort et revenir parmi les   			vivants n'est certainement pas une exp'rience personnelle anodine,   			ni socialement neutre...

  			Fringe-ology   			by Steve Volk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    			From his journey into   			the bizarre, Volk returns with a compelling argument that we need to   			allow for a middle space, a place where paranormal phenomena can be   			weird and compelling; raise crucial questions; and, quite possibly,   			remain unexplainable. He rejects the polarized options the   			twenty-first century seems to offer us: to passionately embrace or   			hotly reject, to revere only science or only spirituality. And he   			underscores, again and again, that by raising our most existential   			questions'why are we here, are we alone in the universe, and what   			happens when we die?'paranormal stories are in fact a crucial point   			of connection. It turns out that these 'fringe' experiences strike   			at the core of what it means to be human.

  			
  			  			  			  			  Eyes of your   			Heart by Frederic Delarue -   			Three tragic incidents, Three   			blessings in disguise! Having had a Near Death Experience at age 12,   			becoming temporarily paralyzed at age 30 and later being visited by   			Jesus at age 40, Frederic Delarue, a native of Chartres, France, has   			had many opportunities to see and experience the Blessings and the   			Light out of the tunnel. Written from the depth of this man s heart,   			Frederic guides us through a very inspirational and unique journey   			while teaching and motivating us to see and accept the luminous side   			in every event occurring in our lives, from a wider perspective than   			just the one we usually see with only our physical eyes. Through   			acceptance, and surrender, Frederic motivates you to discover the   			true radiance of your being, and let the eyes of your heart be the   			foundation of your life, with a heartfelt sincerity.   			About the Author&nbsp; Frederic Delarue is an International Composer of   			soothing musical melodies that emanates from his heart, and is also   			an inspirational Author and Speaker. Born in Chartres, France, he   			received his God given gifts after a Near Death Experience at the   			age of 12. His music touches and empowers your heart and soul with   			the highest inspiration. Frederic is featured on the benefit album,   			Cousteau s Dream, alongside Yanni, Kenny G, Kitaro, and Vangelis   			among many others. Three tragic incidents, three blessings in   			disguise. Two car accidents and 1 medical error that found Frederic   			temporarily paralyzed taught him that miracles can occur when you   			surrender totally. Frederic founded a non-profit organization in   			2007: Cathedral of Angels, Inc. to provide free healing concerts to   			those in need.

  			  			  			Life After Death: A Study of the Afterlife in World Religions -  			 By  			   			Farnaz Masumian, a professor who   			teaches about World Religions at the University of Texas at Austin.  			   			  			One of the most important features of   			the book is that, in discussing afterlife, she quotes &quot;chapter and   			verse&quot; from the sacred texts of each religion. Each chapter focusing   			on a religion includes the major writings of the religion, the   			primary concepts that relate to afterlife, the influence and/or   			similarities of that religion in relationship to other religions.

  			  			 The   			book Your   			Soul's Plan: Discovering the Real Meaning of the Life You Planned   			Before You Were Born by Robert Schwartz ( www.yoursoulsplan.com)   			explores the premise that we are all eternal souls who plan our   			lives, including our greatest challenges, before we're born for   			purposes of spiritual growth. The book contains ten true stories of   			people who planned physical illness, having disabled children,   			deafness, blindness, drug addiction, alcoholism, losing a loved one,   			and severe accidents. The information about their pre-birth plans   			was obtained by four gifted mediums and channels. The book presents   			the actual conversations people had with their future   			parents, children, spouses, friends, and other loved ones when they   			planned their lives together. For readers, suffering that once   			seemed purposeless becomes imbued with deep meaning. Wisdom may be   			acquired in a more conscious manner; feelings of anger, guilt,   			blame, and victimization are healed and replaced by acceptance,   			forgiveness, gratitude, and peace.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

  			  			  			Beginner's   			Guide to Conscious Dying&nbsp;-    			By Diane Goble is an   			introduction to the practice of the Art of Conscious&nbsp;Dying into the   			Clear Light based on ancient&nbsp;beliefs brought up-to-date by modern   			near-death experience reports. Diane Goble is an near-death/after   			life experiencer who has dedicated her life to helping   			others&nbsp;overcome fear of death by practicing to die&nbsp;before we die so   			when our time comes, we&nbsp;know what we can and can't do when we   			find&nbsp;ourselves outside our body looking back at&nbsp;the physical world   			from another dimension&nbsp;of existence, fully conscious and aware   			of&nbsp;what is going on around us.

Hear   			His Voice, by Nancy Clark,&nbsp;   		      			  			Marvelous review by William W. Hoover, M.D.  			Click Here. You don&#39;t have to die,   			nearly die, or suffer any physical trauma or illness in order to   			have the identical experience to what is currently called a   			near-death experience. A normal, healthy and fully conscious person   			can transcend time and space and enter a spiritual realm of   			existence so profound that nothing is ever the same again. Nancy   			Clark is living proof of this. Similar to a near-death experience   			and what the Apostle Paul experienced on the road to Damascus, a   			brilliant illuminating Light transformed Clark&#39;s life as she was   			delivering a eulogy. The Light called her to a life of service to   			share the message of unconditional love, forgiveness, and grace.   			Profoundly inspiring, Hear His Voice offers a glimpse of a modern   			day miracle and the reassurance that we do not walk alone. Could it   			be that a Divine Loving Voice is trying to get humanity&#39;s attention   			during these turbulent days to bring hope and peace to all who seek   			spiritual nourishment? Hear His Voice guides us in our search for   			inner peace and a meaning to life through the revelations gleaned   			from Nancy Clark&#39;s personal mystical experience. A must-read!&nbsp;&nbsp;  			  			Click here to buy:   			    			    			  www.freewebs.com/nancy-clark    			&nbsp;&nbsp;

  			  			  			    			  			  			A Night in Heaven by Albert Haust  			    			The Author describes his night in heaven experience and other   			experiences that helped him grow spiritually. As he went through   			this process he overcame lower back, upper back and neck pain   			through psychological and spiritual means. He made contact with his   			higher self and spirit guidance. He overcame his fear of unfriendly   			spirits. He found that spiritual growth isn't about overcoming the   			&quot;supposed&quot; illusion of an individual self, but rather about becoming   			a soul who is able to live according to unconditional love.

According to Kuan Yin, earth is the most important step   			in our evolution where we, as limitless beings, achieve physical   			manifestation in all of its complexities; where beliefs, intentions   			and desires are the driving forces for reality. Compassion at the   			level personified by Kuan Yin is not some luxury sentiment that   			might be expressed towards others at the appropriate moment. Indeed,   			it is at the very core of our survival. Beneficial Law of Attraction   			- An ancient deity speaks on the law of attraction saying, &quot;You   			create your whole world from your thoughts&quot; and &quot;The universe will   			bring whatever one wants.&quot; These theorems on Kuan Yin's law of   			attraction teachings, as channeled by Lena Lees, focus on specific   			expansive beliefs that can magnetize both personal and mass   			beneficial realities.

  			The   			Art of Death Midwifery: An Introduction and Beginner's Guide,   			by ordained interfaith minister Joellyn St. Pierre, is a compelling   			and comprehensive1 manual for family, clergy, hospice volunteers, or   			medical staff engaged in the field of death and dying. In this   			poetic and powerful book, the author reminds us that society has   			thrown a veil of mystery over the process of death, thereby   			depriving the dying from the dignified and fearless departure they   			so deserve. Based on the tenet that death is neither the enemy nor a   			finite state, St. Pierre gives all helpmates the necessary tools to   			become a death midwife. That is, someone capable of acting as a   			spiritual guide as the dying transition from this life into what   			awaits them after death. Unlike many books on death and dying, this   			guide is leading-edge, based on the author's long experience both in   			lay and clergy. It is a sensitive and lyrical reminder that the   			dying deserve to feel empowered as they leave this life. About the   			Author Joellyn St. Pierre, D.Div., is a former Broadway performer.   			An ordained interfaith minister, St. Pierre earned a Doctorate in   			Divinity with a focus on Death as a Transition. Since 1991, she has   			served as a death midwife with AIDS organizations, hospices,   			hospitals, and families.

  			Practicing   			Conscious Living and Dying:&nbsp; Stories of the Eternal Continuum   			of Consciousness    			by   			  			Annamaria   			Hemingway.&nbsp;   			An uplifting collection   			of spiritually illuminating texts and powerfully thought- provoking   			real life stories, showing death as an integral part of life. Every   			interaction with death, dying and bereavement involves entering the   			painful world of grief and suffering, but at the same time, we are   			given the opportunity to emerge from the experience with a sense of   			awe, and a greater insight into the mystery of creation.&nbsp; Modern   			medical advances have resulted in death and dying becoming a taboo,   			which leaves us feeling isolated when the inescapability of death   			touches our lives. These touching observations of closeness to   			someone else who is dying, and personal accounts of near death   			experiences and after-death communication, illustrate how coming to   			terms with the inevitability of death is actually a life-affirming   			experience. These emotionally powerful and inspirational experiences   			address timeless questions and show how each of the people has come   			to understand that death teaches us that the preciousness of life   			must be lived with a sense of purpose and meaning, as a celebration   			of our existence.&nbsp;  			  				Click   				here for more information

  			  			 Karma:   			How To View It, Use It, and Lose It   			and its author,    			Karen Reed Hadalski ,   			is a well-known writer in the fields of karma, reincarnation, and   			spirituality .  			 Karma   			isn't a mystery. Karma isn't an esoteric philosophy. Karma is a   			natural law--the Law of Cause and Effect--and, just like gravity, it   			is constantly at work in the world and in your life, whether you   			know it or believe in it or not. The book you are holding will give   			you the knowledge and tools necessary to discover and understand the   			playing-out of karma in your physical, mental, psychological,   			social, and spiritual life. It will help you to make sense of your   			life-circumstances and provide a road map for traveling to a more   			fulfilling, joyous, and purposeful future. This book will also   			introduce you to a group of people who have successfully applied the   			tenets of this law, along with a clear understanding of the   			principles of reincarnation, to create productive, successful,   			meaningful lives for themselves: from inventors, composers, healers,   			and military leaders to teachers, business people, artists, and   			bureaucrats. Once you've read it, your life and the way you view   			your world will never be the same.

Is   			There Life After Death? by Anthony Peake.&nbsp;   		    The book is an expansion   			on the theory I proposed in an article published in&nbsp;the Winter 2004   			edition of the IANDS Journal. Entitled Cheating The Ferryman - A New   			Paradigm of Existence? this proposed a radically new interpretation   			of the whole NDE phenomenon. The book takes this theory and supports   			it with a vast amount of evidence taken from the fields of quantum   			physics, neurology, psychiatry, psychology and consciousness   			studies. However as always with such a subject there is also a   			theological angle ' but not the expected one. I use some very   			interesting writings of the second century AD schismatic Christian   			group known as The Gnostics to support the theory. My approach is   			rigidly scientific and as such it is this sectiohttp://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=fringe-ology&x=0&y=0_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=fringe-ology&x=0&y=0as shown most interest.

  			  			  			My Self, My Soul   			-&nbsp; E-book   			  			by James deBar.  			   			An exploration into our human and spiritual journeys through   			intimate dialogue between the Self and the Soul at the time of   			death. During an NDE deBar experienced his 'Soul without encumbrance   			of the Self' which provided a 'clarity and knowing'. 'My Self, My   			Soul' is a manifestation of his reaching back to that pure state,   			and through dialogue with his Soul, deBar explores complex questions   			only the Soul could answer. From the examination of consciousness,   			to the exploration of mortality, the answers that emerge are the   			profound expressions of one Soul's wisdom . . . a pure energy that,   			deBar maintains, exist in each one of us.

  			Hypnotic   			Use of Waking Dreams: Exploring Near Death Experiences Without the   			Flatlines by Paul W. Schenk.   			&nbsp;People who undergo near   			death experiences often have profound and life changing experiences.   			It is as if the whole of their life has been put into focus and they   			can see relationships, experiences, and their hopes and dreams in a   			completely new light. Now Paul Schenk shows you how you can help   			clients experience some of the life-changing benefits of a near   			death experience without the life-threatening cardiovascular crisis.   			With full length annotated case transcripts, you will learn how to   			do this and explore the many other things you can do with   			hypnotically facilitated waking dreams.&nbsp; The therapeutic   			usefulness of dream interpretation is deeply rooted in   			psychotherapy. The Hypnotic Use of Waking Dreams bypasses the   			controversy associated with past life therapy, i.e that if   			reincarnation doesn't exist, neither can past life therapy. It   			provides a much more traditional approach to understanding and   			utilizing the kinds of chemical experiences that occur with this   			interactive approach to hypnotically facilitated dream-like imagery.   			Dr. Shenk integrates classic teachings on dream interpretation and   			trauma treatment with decades of published work on near death   			experiences. The resulting applications to a variety of presenting   			clinical problems are demonstrated with extensive case transcripts.   			The therapeutic use of waking dreams is independent of both the   			clinician's and the client's beliefs about reincarnation because the   			dream content can be understood as being just good fiction as it is   			in classical dream analysis.
