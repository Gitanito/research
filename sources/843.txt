PUBL I SH E R 'S P REFACE
THIS book was originally published in 1920. To reprint it now verbatim, except for an occasional
correction of a misprint, calls for an explanation.
The explanation is quite simple. No book published in the past forty years has replaced this
one or come near replacing it. Regardless of date of publication, this one remains the best encyclo-
paedia available.
It was written and published under extraordinary circumstances which have not repeated them-
selves. Its publisher was the London house of George Routledge & Sons, Ltd., whose leading figures
had a profound interest in occult and metaphysical subjects. Their editor in this field was thelateArthur
Edward Waite, himself one of the greatest scholars who ever turned to these subjects. The author,
Lewis Spence, if less profound and knowledgeable than his editor, had the good fortune to be a much
better writer and popularizer, with a knack for summari1.ing with admirable conciseness the deeper
work of others. Ironically enough, there is a very great deal of A. E. Waite in these pages (prop-
erly credited) and it may well be that (except for THE P ICTORIAL KEY To THE TAROT), Waite
will be remembered by posterity primarily through these pages.
A numberofeminent authorities in this field, consulted on the advisability of reprinting this book,
praised it as the best of its kind, but asked if no way might be found to bring it up to date. A letter
from Dr. ]. B. Rhine pleads eloquently for the need and value of bridging the gap between 1920
and 1960. '\Ve should have been happy to do so but the task was beyond our powers. Our editorial
staff estimated that the minimum outlay necessary would be $100,000. The plain truth of the mat-
ter is that the occult and metaphysical audience has first to be brought together before an outlay
like this can be risked. Consider the simple fact that for most of the forty years since the original
publication of this book, it has not been in print. For twenty years it has been hard to come by and
for ten years it has been as scarce as hen's teeth. In the face of these facts, we consider it a sufficient
achievement for the present to reprint it and to make it available.
Here are 2500 detailed entries, many of which run to several pages. The best way to enjoy them
is to make up a short list of those occult and metaphysical words which come immediately to your
mind, which you know something about but not precisely enough to be sure that you know what
you are talking about, Jook them up and see how what you do know falls into place now. One of
the best tests of this great encyclopaedia is to look up the biography of one of the most famous names
in this field-Paracelsus, Cagliostro, Agrippa, Appollonius of Tyana, the Comte de Saint Germain
-surprises are in store for you! Finally, turn back again to the Index and run your eye down
column after column. You think you know something about the subject, you are certainly inter-
ested in it, yet see how many of the entries are completely unknown to you. This is what a book
should be but so seldom is-a voyage to the unknown. This time you have achieved it.

PREFACE
IN attempting to compile a volume which might serve as a handbook or work of reference
to the several occult sciences, I have not lost sight of the extensive character ot the subject,
which, now that I have completed my task, is more than ever painfully perceptible. Excur-
sions into the hterature of the occult, of a somewhat extensive kind, led me to the belief
that popular misconceptions concerning its several branches were many and varied. Regard-
ing definitions there did not appear to be any substantial agreement, and application to
encyclopredias and ordinary works of reference generally resulted in disappointment. That
a department of human thought so pregnant 1.•,rith interest and so abounding in vitality should
not hitherto have been reduced to presentation in reference form struck me as singular;
and I resolved to do what I could to supply what seemed to me a very real literary and scientific
necessity. That I have been entirely successful is too much to nope. But I have made a
beginning, and this volume may inspire a more worthy hand to the compilation of a more
perfect handbook of the subject.
The science of Anthropology has of late years done much to elucidate questions relating
to the origins of magic, and in writing this volume I have freely applied its principles. I have
not, however, permitted scientific considerations to blind me to the marvellous and romantic
character of the material in which I have laboured. Indeed, I am convinced that had I in any
way attempted to subvert this innate quality of the occult to purely scientific considera-
tions-however worthy of statement-the romance inherent in it would, by reason of its very
native force have defeated such an intention, and, even if arrayed in the poorest of verbiage,
would still retain its marvellous powers of attraction, no estimate of which can be too high.
I have relegated the subject of methods and theories to the introduction. It remains
to thank the many kind friends who ltave assisted me actively and by advice in the compilation
of.this volume. My assistants, Miss .Mavie Jack and Miss K. Nixey, have placed me under a
deep debt of obligation by their careful collection, arrangement and independent work upon
the extensive literature relative to psychic science. To Mr. David MacRitchie, F.S.A. (Scot.),
F.R.A.I., late President of the Gypsy Lore Society, I owe thanks for the article "Gypsies.''
The late Lieut. William Begg collected much Theosophical matter; and Mr. W. G. Blaikie
Murdoch has rendered me the greatest assistance with difficult biographical material. My
lamented friend, the late Mr. A. J. B. Graham, greatly smoothed my path by throwing light
on legal questions.
I have not burdened the articles with references, but have supplied a bibliographical
appendix.

INTRODUCTION
THE sciences known as " occult " may with every reason be regarded as the culture-grounds
of the science of to-day. As everyone knows, alchemy was the forerunner of chemistry,
astrology the direct ancestor of astronomy, and magnetism of hypnotism. But these sub-
jects and their kindred arts have another claim upon our attention and interest, for in heir
evolution we can trace many of the beginnings of philosophic and ethical processes, the
recovery of which renders their examination and study as important to the whole under-
standing of the history of man as that of theology or the new mythology.
A generation ago it was the fashion to sneer at the occult sciences. But to-day, men
of science in the foremost files of thought have placed them on the dissecting slab as fit subjects
for careful examination. The result of their analys1s during the past twenty years, if it
has not permitted us to pierce the veil which divides man and the "supernatural," has, at
all events, served to purge our sight sufficiently to enable us to see things on this side of
it with a clearer vision, and to regard such researches with a more tolerant eye than hitherto.
For example the fact of ghostly appearances is proven, whatever may be their nature, hallu-
cinatory or otherwise, gold has been manufactured, if in small quantities, the theory of thought
transference is justified, and hypnotism is utilised in ordinary medical practice.
It is perhaps necessary that in introducing such a work as this, the author should express
his own beliefs regarding the subject. Concerning psychical science I firmly believe that
there are " more things in heaven and earth" than our philosophy dreams of, but the vast
mass of evidential matter I have perused leads me to the conclusion that as yet we have
merely touched the fringes of the extra-terrestrial, and that we must rely upon psychology
rather than so-called material proof to bring us further enlightenment.
As regards magic, it will be seen that I have paid considerable attention to the scientific
or anthropological theories concerning it. But let not the lover of that wondrous mani-
festation of the human imagination dread that he has been robbed of the mystery which
clings to it as darkness cleaves to night. I have amply provided for him in a hundred places,
and if I have attempted to summarise current scientific hypotheses concerning magic, I have
done so principally for the sake of completeness.
I may perhaps be pardoned if at this juncture I touch briefly upon a suspicion which
I have refrained from including in the article on Magic, for the reason that it has not as yet

blossomed into a theory. I have for some time been of the opinion that what is known as
"sympathetic" and" mimetic" magic is not of the magical species-that in short it does not
partake of the nature of magic at all. When the savage performs an act of sympathetic
"magic," "rain-making" for instance, he does not regard it as magical-that is, it does not
contain any element of wonder to his way of thinking. He regards it as a cause which is certain
to bring about an effect. Now the true magic of wonder argues from effect to cause, so it
would appear as if sympathetic magic were merely a species of proto-science, due to mental
processt:> entirely similar to those by which scientific laws are produced, and scientific acts
are performed-that there is an odour of certainty about it which is not found, for example,
in the magic of evocation.
Although in every way in sympathy with the spirit of the esoteric societies, I have ven-
tured to express my disbelief in the occult knowledge of the generality of their members.
I am afraid, too, that I fail to grasp the arguments advanced by students of the secret tradition
which plead for a belief in the" church existing before the foundations of the world," and the
"inner sanctuaries" of Christianity. I fancy most readers will agree with me that it would be
extremely difficult to raise anything like a respectable membership for such an institution,
and as for its prehistoric existence, that is obviously a matter for the student of mythology.
That both arc the product of mystical foppery and vanity is only too painfully apparent.
A church which is alien to the bulk of humanity can possess little of the true spirit of Christi-
anity. But I must not be conceived as deriding genuine mysticism and in this connection I
would advise all interested in the Grand Quest, advanced as well as neophyte, to peruse a
recent admirable article by Mr. A. E. vVaite, which appeared in "The Occult Review" for
September, 1919, which seems to me to define the aims of the mystic once and for all.
In closing my task I feel deeply impressed by the vastness of the themes which I have
so unworthily and inadequately handled during the compilation of this volume. My attempt
has been to present to the general reader a conspectus of the Occult Sciences as a whole ;
and if experts in any one of those sciences observe any inaccuracy which calls for correction,
I will be deeply obliged to them if they will bring it to my notice.

AN ENCYCLOPJEDIA OF OCCULTISM
A
Ab : (Semitic magical month). Crossing a river on the 2oth
of that montlJ was supposed to bring sickness. In ancient
texts it stntes that if a man should eat the flesh of swine
on the 30th of Ab, be will be _Plagued with boils.
Abaddoo : (The Destroyer). Ch1ef of the demons of the
seventh htcrarchy. A baddon is the name given by St.
j ohn in the Apocalypse to the ldng of the grasshoppers.
He is sometimes regarded as the destroying angel.
Abadie (Jeannette) : A young sorccr~ of the ~ll~e of
Sibourre. in Gascony. She was sleepmg one day 10 her
father's house while high rna~ was being said. A demon,
profiting by the opportunity, carried her off to the Devil's
Sabbath, where she soon awoke to find herself in the midst
of a large company. She observed that the principal
demon had on his head two faces, like Janus. She did not
participate in the revelry, and was transported to her home
by the same means as she had been conveyed thence. On
the threshold she found her amulet, which the demon had
taken the precaution to remove from her bosom before
carrying her off. She made a confession of all that had
happened, renounced her sorcery, and thus saved herseU
from the common fate of witches and sorcerers-the stake.
Abaris : A Scythian, high priest of Apollo, and renowned
magician. In' so flattering a manner did he chant the
praises of Apollo, his master, that the god gave him a
golden arrow, on which he could ride through the air like
a bird, so that the Greeks called him the Aerobate. Pytha-
goras, his pupil, stole this arrow from him, and accom-
plished many wonderful feats by its aid. Abaris foretold
the future, pacified storms, banished disease, and lived
without eating or drinking. He made with the bones of
Pelops, a statue of Minerva, which he sold to the Trojans
as a talisman descended from heaven. This was the
famous Palladium, which protected and rendered im-
pregnable the town wherein it was lodged.
Abdela:r.ys : An Arabian astrologer of the tenth century,
generally known in Europe by his Latin name of Alcbabi-
tius. His treatise on astrology was so much prized that
it was translated into Latin and printed in 1473. Other
editions have since appeared, the best being that of Venice
(1503} entitled Alchabitius cum commento. Translated by
John of Seville. (Hispalcnsis.)
Abon-Ragel : An Arabian astrologer, born at Cordova, at
the beginning of tho fifth century. He was the author of
a book of horoscopes according to the inspection of the
stars, a Latin translation of which was published at Venice,
1485, under the title of De Judiciis sm Jalis slel/arum. It
was said that his predictions were fulfilled in a remarkable
manner.
Abigor : According to Wierius (q.v.), Grand Duke of Hades.
He is shown in the form of a handsome knight, bearing
lance, standard, or sceptre. He is a demon of the superior
order, and responds readily to questions concerning war.
He can foretell the future, and instructs the leaders how
to make themselves respected by the soldiers. Sixty of
the infernal regions are at his command.
Ablsbal : (See Devil.}
Abou-Rybau : An Arabian astrologer whose real name was
Mohammed-ben-Ahmed, to whom is ascribed the intro-
duction of judicio/ Astrology (q.v.} Many stories were told
of him in the East, to show that he possessed in an extra-
ordinary degree the power to read the future.
Abra MeHo: (See Abraham the J ew.)
Abracadabra : A magical word said to be fol'med from the
letters of the abraxas, and written thus :
A
AB
ABR
ABRA
ABRAC
ABRACA
ABRACAD
ABRACADA
ABRACADAB
ABRACADABR
ABRACADABRA
or the reverse way. The pronunciation of this word,
according to Julius Africanus. was equally efficacious
either way. By Scrcnus Sammonicus it was used as a
spell to cure asthma. Abracalan or aracalan is another
form of the word, and is said to have been regarded as
the name of a god in Syria and as a magical symbol by the
Jews. But it seems doubtful whether the alwacadabra,
or its synonyms, was really the name of a deity or not.
{See Abraxas.l
Abraham, Tbe Jew : (Alchemist and magician, circa, 1400}.
Comparatively few biographical facts are forthcoming
concerning this German Jew, who was at onoe alchemist,
magician and philosopher ; and these few facts arc mostly
derived from a very curious manuscript, now domiciled in
the Archives of the Bibliotheque de I'Arsenal, Paris, an
institution rich in occult documents. This manuscript is
couched throughout in French, but purports to be literally
translated from Hebrew, and the style of the handwriting
indicates that the scribe lived at the beginning of the
eighteenth century, or possibly somewhat earlier. A
distinct illiteracy characterises the French script, the
punctuation being inaccurate, indeed frequently conspicuous
by its absence, but an actual description of the document
must be waived till later. Abraham was probably a native
ofMayence, and appear!< to have been born in 1362. We find
that his father, S1mon by name, was something of a seerand
magician, and that the boy accordingly commenced
his occult studies under the parental guidance, while at
a later date he studied under one, Moses, whom he him-
self describes as " indeed a good man, but entirely ignorant
of The True Mystery, and of Tite Veritable Magic." Leav-
ing this preceptor, A braham decided to glean knowledge
by travelling, and along with a friend called Samuel,
a Bohemian by birth, be wandered through Austria and
Hungary into Greece, and thence penetrated to Con-
stantinople, where he remained fully two years. He is
found next in Arabia, in those days a veritable centre of
mystic learning ; and from Arabia he went to Palestine,
whence betimes he proceeded to Egypt. Here be had
the good fortune to make the acquaintance of Abra·
Melin, the famous Egyptian philosopher, who, besides
entrusting to him certain documents, confided in him by
word of mouth a number of invaluable secrets ; and
armed thus, Abraham left Egypt for Europe, where eventu-
Abraham 2
ally he settled at Wurzburg in Germany. Soon he was
deep in alchemistic researches, but these did not prevent
him from espousing a wife, who appears to have been his
cousin ; and by her he l~d three daughters and also two
sons, tl)e elder .named joseph and the younger Lamech.
He took great pains to instruct both of them in occult
affairs, while, on each of his three daughters, he settled a
dov.ry of a hundred thousand golden florins. This con-
siderable sum, together with other vast wealth, he claims
to have gained by travelling as an alchemist; and whatever
the truth of this statement, he certainly won great fame,
being summoned to perform acts of magic before many
rich and influential people, notably the Emperor Sigismuod
of Germany, the Bishop of Wurzburg, King· Henry VI. of
England, the Duke of Bavaria, and Pope John XXIII.
The remainder of Abraham's career is shrouded in mystery,
while even the date of his death is uncertain, but it is
commonly supposed to have occurred abou~ 1460.
The curious manuscript cited above, and from which the
foregoing facts have been culled, is entitled 1'he Book of
1/:e Sacred Magic of A bra-Melin, as delivered by Abraham
Uu: jew tmlo his son Lamecl1. This title, however, is rather
misleading, and not strictly accurate, for Abra-:Melin had
absolutely no hand in the opening part of the work,
this consisting of some account of Abraham's own
youth and early travels in search of wisdom, alon~ with
advice to the young man aspiring to become skilled in
occult arts. The second part, on the other hand, is based
on the documents which the Egyptian sage handed to
the Jew, or at least on the confidences wherewith the former
favoured the latter; and it may be fairly accurately
defined as dealing with the first principles of magic in
general, the titles of some of the more important chapters
being as follows: "How Many, and what are the Classes
of Veritable M!!gic ? " " What we Ought to Take into
Consideration before the Undertaking of the Operation,"
"Concerning the Convocation of the Spirits," and " In
what ::1-Ianner we ought to Carry out the Operations."
Passtng to the third and last part, this likewise is mostly
deri,·ed straight from Abra-~leli:t; and here the author,
eschewing theoretical matter as far as possible, <>ives
information atout t}te actual practice of magic. ln° the
first place he tells how "To procure divers Visions,"
" How one may retain the Familiar Spirits, bound or free,
in whatsoever form," and how "To excite Tempests,"
while in one chapter he treats of raising the dead, another
he devotes to the topic of transforming oneself into " divers
shapes and forms,' and in further pages he descants on
flying in the air, on demolishing buildings, on discovering
thefts, and on walking under the water. Then he dilates on
the Thaumaturgic healing of leprosy, dropsy, paralysis,
and various more common ailments such as fever and sea-
sickness, whtle he offers intelligence on " How to be be-
loved by a Woman," and this he supplements by directions
for commanding the favour of popes, emperors, and other
influential people. Finally, he reverts to the question of
summoning visions, and his penultimate chapter is en-
titled, " How to cause Armed IVIen to Appear," while his
concluding pages treat of evoking "Comedies, Operas,
and all kinds of Music and Dances."
Adam
hero, Abra-Melin. Moreover, he inveighs fiercely against
aU those who recant the religion in which they were bred,
and contends that no one l(llilty of this will ever attain
skill in magic; ~ et it should be said, in justice to the seer,
that he manifests little selfishness, and seems to have
striven after success in his craft with a view to using it
for the benefit of mankind in general. His writings reflect
besides, a firm belief in that higher self existin~~; in every
man, and a keen desire to develop it. (See Flamel.)
Abraxas : (or Abracax). The Basilidian (q.v.,) sect of
Gnostics, of the second century, claimed Abra:ras as their
supreme god. and said that j esus Christ was only a phantom
sent to earth by him. They believed that his name con-
tained great mysteries, as it was composed of fhe seven
Greek letters which form the number 365, which is also the
number of days in a year. Abraxas, they thought, bad
under his command 365 gods, to whom they attributed
365 virtues, one for e:tch day. The older Mythologists
placed him among the number of Egyptian gods, and
demonologists have describtld him a~ a demon, with the
head of a king and with serpents forming his feet. He is
represented on ancient amulets, with a whip in his hand.
It is from hi~ name that the mystic word, Abracadabra
(q.v.) is taken. l\fany stones and gems cut in various
symbolic forms, such as the head of a fowl, a serpent, and
so forth, were worn by the Basili<lians as amulets.
Abred : The inne1·most of three concentric circles represent-
ing the totality of being in the British Celtic cosmogony.
(See Celts.) The stage of struggle and evolution against
Cythrawl, the power of eviL (See also Barddas.)
Absolute (Theosophist) : Of the Absolute, the Logos, the Word
of God, Theo.opbists profess to know nothing further
than that it exists. The universes with their solar systems
are but the manifestations of this Being, which man is
capable of perceiving, and all of them arc instinct with him,
but what man can perceive is not the loftier manifestations
but the lower. r.Ian himself is an emanation from the
Absolute with which he will ultimately be re-united.
Abyssum : A herb used in the ceremony of exorcising a
haunted house. It is signed with the sign of the cross,
and hung up at the four corners of the house.
Aeberat : (See Cagliostro.)
Aehmet : An Arabian soothsayer o! the ninth century. He
w-rote a book on The lnlerprelalioa of Dreams, following
the doctrines of the East. The original is lost. but the
Greek and Latin translations were printed at Paris, in 16o3.
Aconce (Jacques) : Curate of the diocese of Trent, who
became a Calvinist in 1557, and <"arne to England,
While there he dedicated .to Queen Elizabeth his famous
work, on The Stratagems of Satan. This book, however,
is not, as its title might indicate, a dissertation on demono-
logy, but a spirited attack on intolerance.
Adalbert : A French pseudo-mystic of the eighth century.
He boasted that an angel had brought him relics of extra-
ordinary sanctity from all parts of the earth. He claimed
to be able to foretell the future, and to read thoughts. " I
know what you have done," he would say to the people,
" there is no need for confession. Go in peace, your sins
arc forgiven." His so-called " miracles " gaiaed for him
the awe of the multitude, and he was in the habit of giving
away parings of his nails and locks of his hair as powerful
amulets. He is even said to have set up an altar in his own
name. In his history of his life, of which only a fr~ment
remains, he tells us of miraculous powers bestowed by an
angel at his birth. He showed to his disciples a letter
which he declared had been brought to him from J csus
Christ by the hand of St. Michael. These, and similar
blasphemies were put an end to by his being cast
into prison, where he died.
It is by employing I<abalistic squares of letters that all
these things are to be achieved, or at least, almost all of
them, and lack of space makes it impossible to deal with
the many different signs of this sort, whose use the seer
~unsels. But it behoves to _ask what manner of personal-
Ity exhales from these cunous pages ? \Vhat kind of
temperament ? And the answer is that Abraham is shown
as a man of singularly narrow mind, heaping scorn
on most other magicians, and speaking with g-reat derision
of nearly all mystical writings save his own and those of his Adam, Book of tbe Penitence or : A manuscript in the Library
Adam 3
of the Arsenal at Paris, which deals wtth Kabalistic
tradition. It recounts how the sons of Adam, Cain and
Abel, typifying brute force and intelligence, slew each
other, and that Adam's inheritance passed to his third son.
Seth. Seth, it is stated, was permtttcd to advance as far
as the gate of the Earthly Parad.ise without bcing threat-
ened by the guardian angel with his flaming sword, which
is to say that he was an initiate of occult science. He
beheld the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge, which
bad become grafted upon each other so that they formed
one tree. This is supposed by some to have symbolised
the harmony of science and religion in the Kabala. The
guardian angel presented Seth "ith three seeds from this
tree, directing him to place them within the mouth of his
father, Adanz, when he expired. From this planting arose
the burning bush out of which Cod communicated to
Moses his holy name, and from a part of which 1\loses made
his magic wand. This was placed in the Ark.of the Coven-
ant, and was planted hy King David on Mount Zion, grew
into a triple tree and was cut down by Solomon to form
the pillars, Jachin and Boaz, which were placed at the
entrance to the Temple. A third portion was inserted
1n the threshold of the great gate, and acted as a talisman,
permitting no unclean thing to enter the sanctuary. Cer-
tain \\'ickcd priests removed it however for purposes of their
own, weighted it with stones, and cast it into the Temple
reservoir, :vhere it was guarded by an angel, who kept it
from the s1ght of men. During the lifetime of Christ the
reservoir was drained and the beam of wood discovered and
thrown across the brook Kedron, over which our Saviour
passed after his apprehension in the Garden of Olives.
Jt was taken by his executioners and made into the cross.
In this legend we can soe a marked similality to those from
which the conception of the Holy Grail arose.. Man is
restored by the wood through the instrumentality of which
Adam, the first man, fell. The idea that the Cross was a
cutting- of the Tree of Knowledge was widespread in the
middle ages, and may be found in the twelfth· century
Qude del St. Graal, ascribed to Walter Map, but probably
only redacted by him. All the Kabalistic traditions
are embodied in the allegory contained in the Book of tile
Pmitence of Adam, and it undoubtedly supplements and
throws considerable light on the entire Kabalistic literature.
Adam, (L'Abbe) : About the time that the Templars were
being driven from France, the Devilappeared, under various
guises, to the Abbe Adam, who was journeying, attended
by one of the servants from his convent, to a certain part
of his abbacy of the Vaux de Cernay. The e,vil spriit first
opposed the progress of the worthy Abl)(\ under the form
of a tree white with frost, which rushed to\<'ards him with
inconceivable swiftness. The .t\bbe's horse trembled with
fear, as did the servant, but the Abb:i himself made the
sign of the Cross, and the tree disappeared. The good man
concluded that he had seen the Pcvil, and called upon the
Virgin to protect him. Nevertheless, the fiend shortly
reappeared in the sh~pe Of a furious black knight. " Be-
gone," said the AbM. "Why clo you attack me far from
my brothers ? " The nevil once more left him, only to
return in the shape of a tall man, with a long, thin neck.
A dam, to get rid of him. struck him a blow with his fist.
The evil spirit shrank and took the stature and counten·
ance of a little cloaked monk, with a glittering weapon
under his dress. His little eyes could be seen darting
and glancing unaer his cowl. He tried hard to strike the
Abb:\ with the sword he held, but the latter repulsed the
strokes with the sign of the Cross. The demon became in
turn a pig and a long-cared ass. The Ablx-, impatient to
be gone, made a circle on the ground with a cross in the
centre. The fiend was then obliged to withdraw to a
little distance. He changed his long ears into horns, which
AdoDal
did not hinder the Abb6 from boldly addressing him.
Offended by his plain-speaking, the Devil changed himself
into a barrel and rolled into an adjoining field. In a short
time he returned in the form of a cart-wheel, and, without
giving the brother time to put himself 0:1 the defell:3ive,
rolled heavily over his body, without, however, doing him
any injury. After that he left him to pursue his journey
in peace. (See Gaguin, R1g11e d$ Pl:r.Jrppe le Bel, and
Gerinet, Hist. de la Magze en Franu, p. 82.)
Adamantlus : A Jewish doctor, who became a Catholic
::~t Constantinople in the time of Constantine, to whom he
dedicated his two books on Physiogncmy, or, the art of
judging people by their faces. This book, full of con·
tradictions and fantasies, was printed in the Scrip·
tor~ Physiognomoniae veteres, of Franzius, at Attembourg,
in 1780.
Adamnan : (See Scotland.)
Addanc of the Lake : A monster that figures in the Mabinogi
legend of Pereda". Peredur obtains a magic stone which
renders him invisible, and he thus succeeds in slaying this
monster, which had daily killed the inhabitants of the
palace of the King of Tortures.
Adelung, (Jean Christophe) : A German author, born in r 732,
who has left a work entitled, llisloire des folies ltrm1aines,
on Biograpltie des plus celebres 11ecromanciens, alchimistes,
devins, etc. (Leipsic, 1785·1789.) Adelung died at Dresden
in r8o6.
Adepts are men who after stern sell-denial and by means of
consistent self-development, have fitted themselves to
assist in the ruling of the world. The means by which
this position is attained is said to be long and arduous, but
in the end the successful one has fulfilled the purpose for
which he was created and transcends his fellows. The
activities of Adepts are multifarious, being concerned with
the direction and guidance of the activities of the rest of
mankind. Their knowledge, like their powers, say Theoso-
phists, far exceeds that of man, and they can control forces
both in the spiritual and the physical realm, and are said
to be able to prolong their Jives for centuries. They are
also known as the Great White Brotherhood, Rishis,
Rahats, or l\fahatmas. Those who earnestly desire to
work for the betterment of the world may become appren-
tices or chelas to Adepts, in which case the latter arc known
as" masters," but the apprentice must first have practised
self-denial and self-development in order to become suffi-
ciently worthy. The master imparts teaching and wisdom
otherwise unattainable, and helps the apprentice by com-
munion and inspiration. Madame Blavatsky (q.v.) al-
leged that she was the apprentice of these masters, and
claimed that they dwelt in the Tibetan Mountains. The
term Adept was also employed by mediaeval magicians
and alchemists to denote a master of their sciences.
Adhab-Aigal : The Mohammedan purgatory, where the
wicked are tormented by the dark angels l\llunkir and Nekir.
Adjuration : A formula of exorcism by which the evil spirit
is commanded, in the name of God, to do or say what the
exorcist requires of him.
Adona! : A Hebrew word signifying "the Lord," and used
by the Jlebrews when speaking or writing of Jehovah, the
awful and ineffable name of the God of Jsrael. The
Jews entertained the deepest awe for this incommuni-
cable and mysterious name, and this feeling led them to
avoid pronouncing it and to the substitution of the word
Adonai foe" Jehovah" in their sacred text. This custom
still prevails among the Jews, who attribute to the pro-
nouncement of the Holy Name the power of worki.ng
miracles. The Jehovah of the Israelites was their invisible
protector and king, and no image of him was made. He
was worshipped according to his commandments. with an
observance of the ritual instituted through :\loses. The
Adoptive 4
term " jehovah" means the revealed Absolute Deity, the
:Manifest, Only, Personal, Holy Creator and Redeemer.
(See Magic, God, Egypt, Kabala.)
Adoptive Masonry : Masonic societies which adopt women
as members. Early in the eighteenth century such
societies were established in France, and speedily spread
to other countries. One of the first to " adc•pt "
women were the Mopses. The Felicitaries existed in
1742. The Fendeurs or \Voodcutters were instituted
in 1763 by Bauchaine, )faster of a Pario;ian Lodge.
It was modelled on the Carbonari, and its popu-
larity Jed to the establishment of other lodges, notably
the Fidelity, the Hatchet, etc. In 1774 the Grand Orient
Lodge of France established a system of three degrees
called the Rite of Adoption, and elected the Duchess of
Bourbon as Grand Mistress of France. The rite has been
generally adopted into Freemasonry, and various degrees
added from time to time, to the number of about twelve
in all. Latin and Greek mysteries were added to the rite
by the Ladies' Hospitallcrs of Mount Tabor. The greatest
ladies in France joined the French lodges of adoption.
The Rite of Mizraim created lodges for both sexes in 1819,
J8ll, 1838 and 1853, and the Rite of Memphis in 1839.
America founded the Rite of the Eastern Star in .five points.
In these systems admission is generally confined to the
female relations of Masons. The Order of the Eastern Star
and that of Adoptive Mas011YY were attempted in Scotland,
but without success.
Adramelech: According to Wierius (q.v.,) Chancellor of the
infernal regions, Keeper of the '"ardrobe of the Demon
King, and President of the High Council of the Devils. He
was worshipped at Sepharvaim, an Assyrian town, where
children were burned on his altar. The rabbis say that he
shows himself in the form of a mule, or sometimes, of a
peacock.
Adventists : (See Amerlt~a, U.S. of.)
Aeromaney : The art of foretelling future events by the
observation of atmospheric phenomena, as, for example,
when the death of a great man is presaged by the ap-
pearance of a comet. Fran90is de Ia Tour Blanche says
that aeromancy is the art of fortune-telling by means of
spectres which are made to appear in the air, or the re-
presentation by the aid of demons, of future events,
which are projected on the clouds as if by a magic
lantern. " As for thunder and lightning," he adds,
" these are concerned with auguries, and the aspect of the
sky and of the planets belong to the science of astrology."
Aetites or Aquilaeus : A precious stone of magical properties,
composed of oxide of iron with a little silex and alumina,
and said to be found in the stomach or neck of the eagle.
It is supposed to heal faJling sickness, and prevent untimely
birth. It should be worn bound on the arm to prevent
abortion, and on the thigh to aid parturition.
Africa : (See Arabs, Egypt, Semites. The north of Africa is
Mohammedan. This applies also to the Sudan and the
Sahara. For Moorish Magic and Alchemy sec Arabs.
Instances of Arabic sorcery will also be found in the
article "Semites." In West Africa Obeah is practisel:l,
for which see West Indies.)
Magic_in savage Africa is of the lower cultus, and chiefly
of the kind known as "sympathetic." (See rllagie.) But
spiritualistic influence shows itself in fetishism, the cult
of the dead, ju-ju or witchcraft, and the cult of the witch-
doctor.
Bantu Tribes. Among the Zulu and other Bantu tribes
the cult of witchcraft was practised, but in secret. fo.- the
results of detection were terrible. For the tracking of the
witch, a caste of witch-finders was instituted, called " witch-
doctors," whose duty it was to" smell out" the offenders.
These were nearly all women.
Africa
.. It is not difficult to understand," says Lady Barker,
" bearing in mind the superstition and cruelty which
existed in remote parts of England not so very long ago ;
how powerful such women become among a savage people,
or how tempting an opportunity they could furnish of
getting rid of an enemy. Of course they are exceptional
individuals: more observant, more shrewd, and more
dauntless than the average fat, hard-working Kaffir women,
besides possessing the contradictory mixture of great
physical powers and strong hysterical tendencies. They
work themselves up to a pitch of frenzy, and get to believe
as firmly in their own supernatural discernment as any
individual among the trembling circle of Zulus to whom a
touch from the whisk they carry is a sentence of instant
death."
The Zulu witch-finders are attended by a circle of black
girls anc.l women, who, like a Greek chorus, clap their hands
together, and drone throu~h a low monotonous chant, the
measure and rhythm of wh1ch change at times with a stamp
and a swing. N'ot less necessary is a ceremonial dress;
for such things appeal directly to the imagination of the
crowd, and prepare them to be readily influenced by the
necromancer's devices. The " binyanga," "Abangoma"
or " witch-finders," whom Lady Barker describes for us,
were attired with an eye for effect which would have done
credit to a London theatre. It will suffice to depict one
of them. by name Nozinyanga. Her fierce face, spotted
with gouts of red paint on cheek and brow, was partly
overshadowed by a helmet-like plume of the tall feathers
of the sakabula bird. In her right hand she carried a
light sheaf of assegais or lances, and on ber left arm was
slung a small and pretty shield of dappled ox-hide. Her
petticoat, made of a couple of large gay handkerchiefs,
was worn kilt-wise. But if there were little decoration
in her skirts, the deficiency was more than compensated
by the bravery of the bead-necklaces, the goat's-hair
fringes, and the scarlet tassels which covered her from coat
to waist. Her ample chest rose and fell beneath the
baldric of leopard skin, fastened across it with huge brazen
knobs, while down her back bung a beautifully dried and
flattened skin of an enormous boa-constrictor.
When the community had resolved that a certain mis-
fortune was due to the witches, the next step obviously
would be to detect and punish them. For this purpose
the king would summon a great meeting, and cause his
subjects to sit on the ground in a ring or circle for four or
five days. The witch-finders took their places in the
centre, and as they gradu:illy worked themselves up to a.
frantic state of frenzy. resembling demoniacal possession,
they lightly switched with their quagga-tail one or other
of the trembling spectators, who was immediately dragged
away and butchered on the spot. And not only he, but
all the living things in IUs hut- wives and children, dogs
and cats-not one was left alive, nor was a stick left stand-
ing. Sometimes a whole kraal would be exterminated
in this way, and the reader will perceive how terrible the
cruel cu~tom could be made to gratify private revenge or
to work" the king's tyrannical inclinations.
A terrible little sorceress is described by Lady Barker
under the name of Nozilwane, whose weird wistful. glance
had in it something uncanny and uncomfortable. She
was dressed beautifully for her p<fft, in lynx skins folded
over and over from waist to knee, the upper ?art of her
body being covered by strings of wild beasts teeth and
fangs, beads, skeins of gaily-coloured yarn, strips of snake's
skin, and fringes of Angora goat fleece. This, as a decora-
tion, was both graceful and effective ; it was worn round
the body and above each elbow, and fell in soft white
flakes among the brilliant colouring and against the dusky
skin. Lynx-tails depended like lappets on each side of
Africa
her face, which was over-shadowed and almost hidden
by a profusion of sakabu!a feathers. " This bird," says
Lady Barker, "has a very beautiful plumage, and is
sufficiently rare for the natives to attach a peculiar value
and charm to the tail-feathers ; they are like those of a
young cock. curved and slender, and of a dark chesnut
colour, with a white eye at the extreme tip of each feather."
Among all this thick, floating plumage were interspersed
small bladders, and skewers or pins wrought out of tusks.
Each witch-finder wore her own hair, or rather wool,
highly ~eased and twisted up with twine until it ceases
to wear the appearance of hair, and hangs around the face
like a thick fringe, dyed deep red.
Bent double, and with a creeping. cat-like gait, as if
seeking a trail, out stepped Nozilwane. Every movement
of her undulating body kept time to the beat of the girls'
hands and their low crooning chant. Presently she pre-
tended to find the thing she sought, and with a series of
wild pirouettes, leaped into the air, shak-ing her spears
and brandishing her little shield like a Bacchante.
Nowamso, another of the party. was determined that her
companion should not carry off all the applause, and she
too, with a yell and a leap, sprang into the dance to the
sound of louder grunts and harder hand-claps. Nowamso
showed much anxiety to display her back, where a magni-
ficent snake skin, studded in a regular pattern with brass-
headed nails, floated like a stream. She was attired also
in a splendid kilt of leopard skins, decorated with red
rosettes, and her toilet was considered more careful and
artistic than any of the others. Brighter her bangles,
whiter her goat-fringes, and more elaborately painted her
face. Nozilwane, however, had youth and a wonderful
self-reliance on her side. The others, though they all
joined in and hunted out an imaginary enemy, and in turn
exulted over his discovery, soon became breathless and
spent, and were glad when their attendants led them away
to be anointed and to drink water.
CenJraJ Africa. The magical beliefs of Central and
Eastern Africa are but little known. They are for the most
part connected with the cult of the dead and that of the
fetish. As regards the fust :-
When the dead are weary of staying in the bush, they
come for one of their people whom they most affect. And
the spirit will say to the mau : " I am tired of dwelling
in the bush, please to build for me in the town a little house
as close as possible to your own." And he tells him to
dance and sing too, and accordingly the man assembles the
women at night to join in dance and song.
Then, next day, the people repair to the srave of the
Obambo, or ghost, and make a rude idol, after which the
bamboo bier, on which the body is conveyed to the grave,
and some of the dust of the ground, are carried into a little
hut erected near the house of the visited, and a white cloth
is draped over the door.
It is a curious fact, which seems to show that these peo-
ple have a legend something like the old Greek myth of
Charon and the Styx, that in one of the songs chanted
during tbis ceremo11y occurs the following line: " You are
well dressed, but r,ou have no canoe to carry you across
to the other sido. '
Possession. Epileptic diseases, in almost all uncivilised
countries, are assumed to be the result of demoniac pos-
session. In Central Africa the sufferer is supposed to be
possessed by ll·lbwiri, and he can be relieved only by the
intervention of the medicine-man or fetish. In the middle
of the street a hut is built for his accommodation, and there
he resides until cured, or maddened, along with the priest
and his disciples. There for ten days or a fortnight a
continuous revel is held ; much eating and drinking at the
expense of the patient"s relatives, and unending dances
5 Africa
to the sound of flute and drum. For obvious reasons the
fetish gives out that l\tbwiri regards good living ·with
aversion. The patient dances, usually shamming madness,
until the epileptic attack comes on, with all its dreadful
concomitants-the frenzied stare, the convulsed limbs,
the gnashing teeth, and the foam-flecked lips. The man's
actions at this period are not ascribed to himself, but to the
demon which has control of him. When a cure has been
effected, real or pretended, the patient builds a little fetish-
house, avoids certain kinds of food, and performs certain
<!uties. Sometimes the process terminates in the patient·~
insanity ; he has been known to run away to the bush,
hide from all human being!>, and Jive on the roots and
berries of the forest.
··These fetish-men," says Read, "arc priest doctors,
like those of the ancient Gennans. They have a profound
knowledge of herbs, and also of human nature, for they
always monoP<'lise the real power in the state. But it
is very doubtful whether they possess any secrets save
that of extracting virtue and poison from plants. During
the first trip which I made into the bush I sent for one of
these doctors. At that time I was staying among the
Shekani·, who are celebrated for their fetish. He came
attended by half-a-dozen disciples. He was a tall man
dressed in white, with a girdle of Jeopard's skin, from which
hung an iron bell, of the same shape as our sheep bells.
He bad two chalk marks over his eyes. I took some of my
"own hair, frizzled. it with a burning glass, and gave it to
him, He popped it v.ith alacrity into his little gmss bag :
for white man's hair is fetish of the first order. Then I
poured out some raspberry vinegar into a glass, drank a
little of it first, country fashion, and offered it to him.
telling him that it was blood from the brains of great
doctors. Upon this he received it with great reverence,
and dipping his fingers into it as if it was snap-dragon,
sprinkled with it his forehead, both feet between the two
first toes, and the ground behind his back. He then handed
his glass to a disciple, who emptied it, and smacked. his
lips afterwards in a very secular manner. I then de51~ed
to see a little of his fetish. He drew on the ground mth
red chalk some hieroglyphics, among which I d~stinguis!ted
the circle, the cross, and the crescent. He smd that If I
would give him a fine •dush.' he would tell me all about it.
But as he would not take anything in reason, and as I
knew that he would tell me nothing of very great impor-
tance in ·public, negotiations were suspended."
The fetish-man seldom finds a native disposed to question
hi.c; claim of supernatural powers. He is not only a doctor
and a priest-two capacities in which his influence is
necessarily very powerful-he is also a witch-finder, and
this is an office which invests him with a truly formidable
authority. When a man of worth dies, his death is in-
variably ascribed to witchcraft, and the aid of the fetish-
man is invoked to discover the witch.
When a man is sick a long time, they call Ngembi. and if
she cannot make him well, the fetish-man. He comes at
night, in a white dress, with cock's feathers on his head,
and having his bell and little glass. He calls two or three
relations together into a room. He does not speak, but
always looks in his glass. Then he tells them that the
sickness is not of Mbwiri, nor of Obambo, nor of God, but
that it comes from a witch. They say to him, "What
shall we do ? " He goes out and sayc:;, "I have told you.
I have no more to say." They give him a dollar's worth of
cloth, and every night they gather toge~her in the street,
and they cry," I know that man who b~w1tched my bro~er.
It is good for you to make him well." Then the w1tch
makes him well. But if the man do not recover they call
the bush doctor from the Shekani country. He sings in
the language of the bush. At night he goes into the street;
African
all the people fiock about him. With a tiger-cat skin in
his hand, he walks to and fro, until, singing all the while,
he lays the tiger-skin at the feet of the witch. At the con-
clusion of his song the people seize the v.-itch, and put him
or her in chains, saying, " If you don't restore our brother
to health, we ·will kill you."
African Builders' Architects : A mystical association founded
by one, C. F. Koffen, a German official 1;1734-1797)· Its
ostensible object was that of literary culture and intellect-
ual study, but masonic quali.fications were required of its
members, and it attracted to itself some of the most
distinguished Continental literati of the period. It had
branches at \Vorms, Cologne and Paris. It is asserted
that it was affiliated with the Society of Alethophilas or
Lovers of Truth, which. indeed, is the name of one of its
grades, the designations of which were as folio"' : Inferior
Grades: (1) Apprentice of Egyptian Secrets; (2) Initiate
into Egyptian Secrets; (3) Cosmopolitan; (4) Christian
Philosopher ; (5) Alethopbilos. Higher ·Grades: (I)
Esquire ; (2) Soldier ; (3) Knight-thus supplying Egypt-
ian, Christian and Templar mysteries to the initiate. In
t8o6 there was published at Berlin a pamphlet entitled
A Discovery Conceming the System of the Order of African
Architects.
Ag : A red flower used by the natives of Hindustan to pro-
pitiate their god, Sancc. It is made into a ·wreath with
jusoo11, also a red-coloured flower, which is hung round the
neck of the god, who is of a congenial nature. This cere-
mony is performed by night.
Agaberte : Daughter of a certain giant called Vagnoste,
dwelling in Scandinavia. She was a powerful enchantress,
and was rarely seen in her true shape. Sometimes she
would take the form of an old woman, wrinkled and bent,
and hardly able to move about. At one time she would
appear weak and ill, and at another tall and strong, so that
her bead seemed to touch the clouds. These transforma-
tions she effected without the smallest effort or trouble.
People we.re so struck with her marvels that they believed
her capable of overthrowing the mountains, tearing up the
trees, drying up the rivers with the greatest of ease. They
held that nothing less than a legion of demons must be at
her command for the accomplishment of her magic feats.
She seems to be like the Scottish Cailleach Bheur, a nature
hag.
6
Agapis : This is a yellow stone, so called because it promotes
love or charity. It cures stings and venomous bites, by
being dipped in water and rubbed over the wound.
Agares : According to Wierius (q.v.) Grand Duke of the
eastern region of Hades. He is shown under the form of
a benevolent lord mounted on a crocodile. and carrying a
hawk on his fist. The army he Jlrotects in battle is indeed
!ortunate, for he disperses thc1r enemies, and puts new
courage into the hearts o! the cowards who fly before
superior numbers. He distributes place and power, titles
and prelacies, teaches all languages, and has other equally
remarkable powers. Thirty-one legions are under his
command.
Agate, or Achates : Good against the biting of scorpions or
serpents, soothes the mind, drives away contagious air,
and puts a stop to thunder and lightning. It is said also
to dispose to solitude, promote eloquence, and secure the
favour of princes. It gives victory over their enemies
to those who wear it.
Agathloo : A familiar spirit which appears only at mid-day.
It takes the shape of a man or a beast, or even encloses
itsel! in a talisman, bottle, or magic ring.
Agathodemon : A good demon. worshipped by the Egyptians
under the shape of a serpent with a human head. The
dragons or flying serpents venerated by the ancients were
also called Agathodemons, or good genies.
Agrippa
Agla : A kabalistic word used by the rabbis for the exorcisms
of the evil spirit. It is made up of the initial letters of
the Hebrew words, Athah gabor leolam, Adonai, meaning,
"Thou art powerful and eternal, Lord." Not only among
the Jews was this word employed, but among the more
superstitious Christians it was a favourite weapon y,-jth
which to combat the evil one, even so late as the sixteenth
century. It is also to be found in many books on magic,
notably in the Enchiridi011 of Pope Leo III.
Aglaophotis : A kind of herb which grows in the deserts
of Arabia, and which was much used by sorcerers for the
evocation of demons. Other plants were then employed
to retain the evil spirits so long as the sorcerer required
them.
Agreda (Marie of) : A Spanish nun, who published about the
middle of the seventeenth century a work entitled, The
Mystic City of God, a Miracl& of the All-powerful, the Abyss
ofGrace : Divine History o{ the Life ofthe Most Holy Virgin
.Mary, ;l1other of God, our Queen attd Jl/istress, manifested
in these last times by the Holy V1'rgin to /he Sister Marie of
Jesus, Abbess of the Convent of the Immaculate Conception
of the town of Agreda, and written by that same Sister by
order of Iter Superiors and Confessors.
This work, which was condemned by the Sorbonne, is a
pretended account of many strange and miraculous hap-
penings which befell the Virgin from her birth onwards,
including a visit to Heaven in her early years, when she
was given a guard of nine hundred angels.
Agrippa von Nettesheim, Henry Cornelius (1486.1535) : A
German soldier and physician, and an adept in alchemy,
astrology and magic. He was born at Cologne on the 14th
of September, 1486, and educated at the University of
Cologne. While still a youth he served under ?vlaximilian I.
of Germany. In 1509 he lectured at the University of
Dole, but a charge of heresy brought against him by a monk
named Catilinet compelled him to leave Dole, and he re-
sumed his former occupation of soldier. In the following
year he was sent on a diplomatic mission to England, and
on his return followed Maximilian to Italy, where he passed
seven years, now serving one noble patron, now another.
Thereafter he held a post at :\letz, returned to Cologne,
practised medicine at Geneva, and was appointed physician
to Louise of Sa\·oy, mother of Francis I. ; but, on being
given some task which he found irksome, he left the service
of his patroness and denounced her bitterly. He then
accepted a post offered him by Margaret, Duchess of Savoy,
Regent of the Netherlands. On her death in r83o, be
repaired to Cologne and Bonn, and thence to France, where
he was arrested for some slighting mention of the Queen-
Mother, Louise of Savoy. He was soon released, however,
and died at Grenoble in 1535. Agrippa was a man of great
talent aud varied attainments. He was acquainted with
eight languages, and was evidently a physician of no mean
ability, as well as a soldier and a theologian. He had,
moreover, many noble patrons. Yet, notwithstanding
these advantages, he never seemed to be free from mis-
fortune; persecution and financial difficulties dogged his
footsteps, and in Brussels he suffered imprisonment for
debt. He himself was in a measure responsible for his
troubles. He was, in fact, an adept in the gentle art of
making enemies, and the persecution of the monks with
whom he frequently came into conflict was bitter and
increasing. His principal works were a defence of magic,
entitled De oCCttltu philosophia, which was not published
until 1531 ,'though it was written some twenty years earlier,
and a satirical attack on the scientific pretensions of his
day, De incertiiJtdi11e el Vanilate Scientiar14m et A rtium
alql4e Excellenlia Verbi Dei Dedamatio, also published at
Antwerp in 1531. His other works included a treatise
De Nobilitate et Praeceflenlia Femi1111 Sex115, dedicated to
Agrippa
Margaret of Burgundy out of gratitude for her p"tronage.
His interest in alchemy and magic dateti from an early
period of his life, and gave rise to many tales of his occult
powers. It was said that he was always accompanied
by a familiar in the shape of a large black dog. On his
death he renounced his magical works and addressed his
familiar thus: " Begone, wretched animal, the entire cause
of my destruction ! " The animal fted from the room and
straightway plunged into the Saom, where it perished. At
the inns where he stayed, Agrippa paid his bills with money
that appeared genuine enough at the time, but w!1ich after-
wards turned to worthless hom or shell, like the fairy
money which turned to earth after sunset. He is said to
have summoned TuUy to pronounce his Qration for Roscius,
in the presence of John George, elector Gf Saxony, the
Earl of ::iurrey, Erasmus, and other eminent people. Tully
duly appeared, delivered his famous oration, a[ld left his
audience deeply moved. Agrippa had a magic glass,
wherein it was possible to sec objects distant in time or
place. On one occasion Surrey sa'v therein his mistress,
the beautiful Geraldine, lamenting the absence of her
noble lover.
One other story concerning the magician is worthy of
record. Once when about to leave home fGr a short time,
he entrusted to his wife the key of his museum, warning her
on no account to permit anyone to enter. But the curiosity
of a b_oarder in their house prompted him to beg for t he
key, ttl! at length the harrasscd hostess gave it to him.
The first thing that caught the student's attention was a
book of spells, from which he began to read. A knock
sounded on the door. The student took no notice, but
went on reading, and the knock was repeated. A moment
later a demon entered, demanding to know why he had
been summoned. The student was too terrified to make
n:ply, and the angry,demon sc~ed him by the throat an1
strangled him. At the same moment Agrippa entered,
havtng returned unexpectedly from his journey. Fearing
that he would be charged with the murder of the youth. he
persuaded the demon to restore him to life for a little while,
and walk him up and down the market place. The demon
consented ; the people saw the student apparently alive
and in good health, and when the demon allowed the
semblance of life to leave the body, they thought the young
man had died a natural death. However. an examination
clearly showed that he had been strangled. The true
state of affairs leaked out, and Agrippa was forced to fiee
for his li!e.
These fabrications of the popular imagination were
probably encouraged rather than suppressed by AIJrippa.
who loved to surround his comparatively harmless pursuits
of alchemy and astrology with an air of mystery calculated
to inspire awe and terror in the minds of the ignorant.
It is known that he had correspondents in all parts of the
world, and that from their letters, which he received in his
retirement, he gleaned the knowledge which he was popu
larly believed to obtain from his familiars.

out of revenge tl1cy find their _pleasure in injuring the

tbe malice of the Cacodaemons. A hrimanes and his

Aksakof, (Alexandre) : A Russian statesman, whose name
stands high in the spiritualistic annals of his country.
Born in 1832, he was educated at the Imperial Lyceum of
St. Petersburg, and aftenvards became Councillor of State
to the Emperor of Russia. He made bi.o; fust acquaintance
with spiritualism through the writings of Swedenborg,
some of which he afterwards translated. Later, he st-udied
the works of other spiritualistic writers. He was instru-
mental in bringing many mediums to Russia, and identified
himself with Horne, Slade, and other well-known mediums,
and later with Eusapia Palladino. Mainly at the instance
of M. Aksakof, a ltussian Scientific Committee was ap-
pointed in 1877 to enquire into spiritualism, but its enquiry
was conducted in a very half-hearted manner. M. Aksakof
was for many years compelled to publish his psychic works
an·d journals in Germany and other countries. on account of
the prohibition of the Russian Government. (Se• Russia.)

Alain of Lisle : It has been said by some writers that there
were two men to whom wa!< v,iven the name of Alanus
Insulensis, one of whom was Ber.nardine, Bishop of Auxerre
and author of a Commentary en the Prophecies of Merlin;
the other, that " Universal Doctor:· whose brilliant career
at the Paris University was followed by his withdrawal
to a cloister, where he devoted himself entirely to the study
of philosophy. Others again maintaiJl that the Bishop of
Auxerre and the '' Universal Doctor " were one and the
same. Even the date when they lived is very uncertain,
being variously placed in the twelfth and thirteenth cen-
turies. In the year t6oo a treatise on alchemy, entitled
Alamut
Dicta de Lapide Philoso{>Jtico was published at Leyden,
bearing on its title-p:~ge the name of A1anus lnsulensis. It
was thus ascribed to Bemardine, to the" Universal Doctor,"
and, by still others, to a German named Alanus. Suppos-
ing the two first·mentioned to be separate and <tistinct
persons. we have nevertheless no proof that either was
interested in alchemy•: and as for the third, t!oere is no
proof that he existed at a!l. On the other hand. we know
that it was customary at that time to ascribe works of a
very inferior nature to illustriou:l pers:>ns who had died,
and were thus unable to deny them. The Dicta de Lapide
Pltilosophico, a work of no great alchemistical value, on
account of its vague and indefinite nature. may be, and
probably is, a spurious work, wrongly ascribed to Alain.
Alamut : A mountain in Persia. (See Assassins.)

Alary (Francois) : A visionary. who had printed at Rouen
in •701, The Prophecy of Count Bombasle, (Chevalier de Ia
Rose-Croix), tzephew of Paracelsus, (published in J609 on
the birth of Louis the Great.)
Alaster : A cruel demon. who, according to Wierius, filled
the post of chief executioner to the monarch of Hades.
The conception of him somewhat resembles that of Nemesis.
Zoroaster is said to have called him " The EKecutioner."
Others confound him with the de~troying angel. Evil
genies were formerly called Alastors. Plutarch says that
Cicero, wuo bore a grudge against Augustus, concciv~d
the plan of committing suicide 011 the emperor's hearth,
and thus. becoming his A /astor.
Albertus Magnus : No fewer than twenty-one folio volumes
are attributed to this alchemist, and though it is highly
improbable that all of them are really his, the ascription
in several cases resting on but slender evidence, those others
which are incontestably from his pen, are sufficiently
numerous to constitute him a surprisingly voluminous
writer. It is noteworthy, moreover. that according to
tradition, he was the inventor of the pistol and the cannon;
but, while it is unlikely that the credit is due to him for
this, the mere fact that he was thus acknowledged in<ti-
cates that his scientific skill was recognised by a few, if
only :t few, of the men of his own time.
Albertus was born at Larvingen, on the Danube, in the
year 1205, and the term Magnus, which is usually applied
to him, is not the result of his reputation, but is the Latin
equivalent of his family name, de Groot. Like many
anot):ler man destined to become famous, he was distinctly
stuptd as a boy, but from the outset he showed a predilection
for religion, and so it came about that one night the blessed
Virgin appeared to him, whereupon his intellect suddenly
became metamorphosed, acquiring extraordinary vitality.
Albertus therefore decided that he must show his gratitude
to the Madonna by espousing holy orders, and eventually
h~ won eminence in the clerical profession, and was made
B1shop of Ratisbon ; but he held this office for only a little
w~z.ile•. resigning it that he might give his entire time to
setenbfic researches. Thenceforth, until bis death, the
exact date whereof is uncertain, he lived chiefly at a
P!easant retr~at in Cologne ; and it is reported that here
hts mental vtgour gradually forsook him, being replaced
by the dullness which characterised him as a youth.
.Albertus was repeatedly charged by some of his un-
~endly con~emporaries .with holding communications
With the de':'tl, and practising the craft of magic : while
aprop~s of hts rep~ted leanings in this particular, a curious
story 1S recounted 1!' an. early history.of ~he University of
Pans. The alchemtst, 1t seems had mvtted some friends
to his house at Cologne, among them being William, Count
of Holland, and when the guests arrived they were amazed
to find that, though the season was mid-winter and the
ground was covered with snow, they were expected to
partake of a repast outside in the garden. Great chagrin
Alblgerius
was manifested by everybody, while some even declared
themselves insulted ; but their host bade them be seated,
assuring them that all would be well. They continued to
be dubious withal, yet they took their places. and hardly
had they began to eat and drink ere their annoyance
vanished, for lo I the snow around them melted away.
the sun shone brightly, the birds sang, and summer ap-
peared to be reign!,ng indeed. . .
Michael ).faier, the author of 1\.fuseum Chtmzcum and
numerous other alchemistic works, declares that A /bertus
succeeded in evolving the philosopher's stone, and that
ere his death he handed it over to his distinguished pupil,
St. Thomas Aquinas, who subsequently destroyed the
precious article, suspecting it t? be a contriva_nce of t~e
devil. The alleged discoverer htmself ~ays no~hing.on this
subject but in his D1 Rebus Metallt~ls et Mu~eraltbus, he
tells h~w h~ had personally tested some gold which had
been manufactured by an alchemist, and which resisted
many searching fusions. And, be. thi.s story. tr~e .or not.
A lbertus was certainly an able setenttst, while tt JS clear
that his learning ultimately gained wide recognition, for a
collected edition of his vast writings was issued at Leyden
so late as 1653.
Alblgenses : A sect which originated in the ~outh of France
in the twelfth century. They were so called from one
of their territorial centres, that of Albi. It is probable
that their heresy came originally from Eastern Europe,
and they were often designated Bulgarians, and undoubt·
edly kept up intercourse with certain secretaries of Thra~e.
the Bogomil~ : and they are sometimes connecte~ With
the Paulicians. It is difficult to form any exact tdea of
their doctrines, as Albigensian texts are rare, anc;i contain
little concerning their ethics, but we know that they were
strongly opposed to the Roman Catholic Church, .an.d
protested against the corruption of its clergy. B?t 1t IS
not as a religious body that we have to deal Wl~h the
Albi"enses here but to consider whether or not theu cult
poss~sed any ~ccult significance. It has been claimed by
their opponents that they admitted two fundamental
principles, good and bad. saying that God had produced
Lucifer from Himself; that indeed Lucifer was the son
of God who revolted against Him ; that he had carried
with him a rebt>llious party of angels, who were driven from
Heaven along with him ; that Lucifer in his exile had
created this world with its inhabitants, where he reigned,
and where all was evil. It is alleged that they further
believed that God for the re-estahlishment of order had
produced a second son, who was Jesus Christ. Further-
more the C3tholic writers on the Albigenses ch:lfged them
with believing that the souls of meu were demons lodged
in mortal bodies in punishment of their crimes.
All this is, of course, mere tra<tition, and we may be sure
that the dislike of the Albigenses for tile irregularities then
current in the Roman Church, brought such charges on
their heads. They were indeed the lineal ancestors of
Protestantism. A crusade was brought against them by
Pope Innocent III., and wholesale massacres took place.
The Inquisition was also let loose upon them, and t~ey
were driven to hide in the forests and among the mountaJns,
where, like tbe Covenanters of Scotland, they held sur-
reptitious meetings. The Inquisition terrorised the district
in which they had dwelt so thoroughly that the very name
of A lbigeuses was practically blotted out, and by the year
IJJO, the records of the Holy Offic.e show no further writs
issued against tile heretics.
AJblgerlus : A Carthaginian soothsayer mentioned by St.
Augustine. He would fall into strange ecstacies in which
his soul, separated from his body, would travel abroad
and find out what was taking place in distant parts. He
could read people's inmost thoughts, and discover any-
Albumazar
thing be wished to learn. These wonders were ascribed
to the agency of the Devil. St. Augustine also speal<s
of another case. in which the possessed man was ill of a
fever. Though not in a trance, but wide awake, he saw
the priest who was comins t.o visit him while he was yet
six leagues away, and told the company assembled round
his couch the exact moment when the good man would
arrive.
Albumuar ; An astrol?ger of the ninth century, born in
Korassan, known principally by his astrolqgical treatise,
entitled, Thousall'ts of Years, in wlllch he declares that the
world could only have been created when the seven planets
were in conjunction in the first degree of the ram, and that
the end of the world would take place when these seven
planets (the number has now risen to twelve) will be
together in the la.'lt degree of the fish. Several of Albmna-
zar's treatises on astrology have been printed in Germany,
of which one was his Tractus Florum Astrologia, Augsburg,
1488. (See Astrology.)

Alchemist, A Modern Egyptian : A correspondent writing to
the Liverpool Post of Saturday, November 28th, 1907,
gives an interesting description of a veritable Egyptian
alchemist whom he had encountered in Cairo not long
before, as follows : " I was not slow in seizing an opportun-
ity of making the acquaintance of the real alchemist living
in Cairo, which the winds of chance had blown in my dir-
ection. He received me in his private house in the native
quarter, and I was delighted to observe that the appearance
of the man was in every way in keeping with my notions
of what an alchemist should be. Clad in the flowing robes
of a graduate of AI Azhar, his long grey beard giving him
a truly venerable aspect, the sage by the eager, far-away
expression of his eyes. betrayed the mind of the dreamer,
of the man lost to the meaner comforts of the world in his
devotion to the secret mysteries of the universe. After
the customary salaams, the learned man informed me
that he was seeking three things-the philosopher's stone,
at whose touch all metal should become gold-the elixir
of life. and the universal solvent which would dissolve
all substances as water dissolves sugar; the last, he assured
me, he had indeed discovered a short time since. I was
well aware of the reluctance of the mediaeval alchemists
to divulge their secrets. believing as they did that the
possession of them by the vulgar would bring about ruin
of states and the fall of divinely constituted princes;
and I feared that the reluctance of the modern alchemist
to divulge any secrets to a stranger and a foreigner would
be no less. However, I drew from my pocket Sir William
Crookes'sspinthariscope-a small box containing a particle
of radium higl1ly magnified-and showed it to the sheikh.
When he applied it to his eye and beheld the wonderful
phenomenon of this dark speck flashing out its fiery needles
on all sides, he w:ts lost in wonder, and when r assured him
that it would retain this property for a thousand years,
he hailed me as a fellow-worker, and as one who had indeed
penetrated into the secrets of ·the world. His reticence
disappeared at once, and he began to tell me the aims and
methods of alchemical rese:1rch, which were indeed the
same as those of the ancient alchemists of yore. His
universal solvent he would not show me, but assured me
of its efficacy. I asked him in what he kept it if it dissolved
all things. He replied ' In wax,' this being the one ex-
ception. I suspected that he had found some hydro-
fluoric acid, which dissolves glass, and so has to be kept
in wax bottles, but s:1id nothing t.o dispel Ills illu;ion.
"The next day I was gran te:i the unusual privilege of
inspecting the sheikh's laboratory, and duly presented
myself at the appointed time. My highest expectations
were ful.6.lled; everything was exactly what an alchemist's
9 Alchemy
laboratory should be. Yes, there was the sage, surrounded
by his retorts, alembics, crucibles, furnace, and bellows,
and, best of all. supported by familiars of gnome-like
appearance. squatting on the ground, one blowing the fire
(a task to be performed daily for six hours continuously),
one pounding substances in a mortar, and another seem-
ingly engaged in doing odd jobs. Involuntarily my eyes
sought the pentacle inscribed with the mystic word ' Abra-
cadabra,' but here I was disappointed, for the black arts
had no place in this laboratory. One of the familiars had
been on a voyage of discovery to London, where he bought
a few alchemical materials ; another had explored Spain
and :\[orocco, without find.ing any alchemists, and the
third had indeed found alchemists in Algeria, though they
had steadily guarded their secrets. After satisfying my
curiosity in a general way, I asked the sage to explain the
principles of his researches and to tell me on what his
theories were based. I was delighted to find that his
ideas were precisely those of the medi:evnl alchemists
namely, that all metals arc debased forms of the original
gold, which is the only pure, non-composite metal ; all
nature strives to return to its original purity, and all metals
would return to gold if they could ; nature is simple and
not complex, and works upon onll principle, namely, that
of sexual reproduction. It was not easy, as will readily
be believed, to follow lhc mystical explanations of the
sheikh. Air was referred to by him as the ' vulture,' tire
as the ' scorpion,' water as the ' serpent,' and earth as
'calacant' ; and only after considerable cross-questioning
and confusion of mind was I able to disentangle his argu-
ments. Finding his notions so entirely medi:eval, I was
anxious to discover whether be was fami!.iar with .the
phlogistic theory of the seventeenth century. The alchem-
ists of old had noticed that the earthy matter which
remains when a metal is calcined is heavier than the metal
itself, and they explained this by the hypothesis, .that the
metal contained a spirit known as ' phlogiston,' which
becomes visible when it escapes from the metal or com·
bustible substance in the form of flame; thus the presence
of the phlogiston lightened the body just as gas does, and
on its being expelled, the body gained weight. I accord-
ingly asked the chemist whether he had found that iron
gains weight when it rusts, an experiment he had ample
means of making. But no, he had not yet reached the
seventeenth century ; he had not observed the fact, but
was none the less ready with his answer; the rust of iron
was an impurity proceeding from within, and which did not
effect the weight of the body in that way. lie declared
that a few days would bring the realisation of his hopes.
and that he would shortly send me a sample of the philo-
sopher's stone and of the divine elixir ; but although his
promise was made some weeks since, I have not y<t seen
the fatdul discovt:ries."
Alchemy : The science by aid of which the chemical philo-
sophers of medi:eval times attempted to transmute the
baser metals into gold and silver. There is considerable
divergence of opinion as to the etymology of the word,
but it would seem to be derived !rom the Arabic al=the,
and l!imya=chemistry, which in turn derives from late
Greek clle~mia=chemistry, from chumeia a mingling,
or cheein " to pour out," or " mix," Aryan root ghu,
to pour, whence the word "gus:1." Mr. A. \Vallis
Budge in his Egyptian Macic, however, states that
it is possible that it may be derived from the Egyptian word
khemeia, that is to say •· the prepualion of the black ore,"
or "powder,'' which was regarded as the active principle in
the transmutation of metals. To this name the Arabs
affixed the article a/, thus giving al-khemeia, or alchemy.
History of Alchemy.-From an early period the Egypt·
ians possessed the reputation of being skilful workers in
Alchemy 10
metals, and, according to Greek writers, they were con-
vetsant with their transmutation, employing quicksilver
in the process of separating gold and silver from the native
matrix. The resulting oxide was supposed to possess
marvellous powers, and it was thought that there resided
within it the individualities of the various metals-that
in it their various substances were incorporated. This
black powder was mystically identified with the under-
world form of the god Osiris, and consequently was credited
with magical properties. Thus there grew up in Egypt
the belief that magical powers existed in ll.uxes and alloys.
Probably such a belief existed throughout Europe in con-
nection with the bronze-working castes of its several races.
(See Shelta Tharl.) It was probably in the Byzantium
of the fourth century, however, that alchemical scienee
received embryonic form. There is llttle doubt that
Egyptian tradition, filtering through Alexandrian Hellenic
sources was the foundation upon which the infant science
was built, and this is borne out by the circumstance that
the art was attributed to Hermes Trismegistus (q.v.) and
supposed to be contained in its entirety in his works.
The Arabs, after their conquest of Egypt in the seventh
century, carried on the researches of the Alexandrian
school, and through their instrumentality the art was
brought to Morocco and thus in the eighth cen~ury to
Spain, where it tl.ourished exceedingly. Indeed, Spain
from the ninth to the eleventh century became the reposi-
tory of alchemical science, and the colleges of Seville,
Cordova, and Granada were the centres from which this
science radiated throughout Europe. The first practical
alchemist may be said to have been the Arabian Geber
(q.v.), who flourished 720-750. From his Summa Perfec-
tionis, we may be justified in assuming that alchemical
science was already matured in his day, and that he drew
his inspiration from a still older unbroken line of adepts.
He was followed by Avicenna, Mesna and Rhasis (q.v.),
and in France by Alain of Lisle, Arnold de Villanova and
Jean de :.'lfeung (q.v.) the troubadour; in England by
Roger Bac n and in Spain itself by Raymond Lully.
Later, in French alchemy the most illustrious names are
those of Flame! (b. ca. 1330). and Bernard Trevisan
(!?. ca. qo6) after which the centre of interest changes to
Germany and in some measure to England, in which
countries Paracelsus, Khunrath (ca. 156o), Maier (ca. 1568),
Bi:ihme, Van Helmont, the Brabanter (1553), Ripley,
Norton, Dalton, Charnock, and Fludd kept the alchemical
fl.ame burning brightly. It is surprising how little altera-
tion we find throughout the period between the seventh
and the seventeenth centuries, the heyday of alchemy, in
the theory and practice of the art. The same sentiments
and processes arc found expressed in the later alchemical
authorities as in the earliest, and a w~ndcrful unanimity
as regards the basic canons of the great art is evinced by
the hermetic students of all time. On the introduction
of chemistry as a practical art, alchemical science fell into
desuetude and dis:rep\lte, owing chiefly to the number of
C!Iarlatans practising it, and by the beginning of the
e1ghteenth century, as a school, it may be said to have
become defunct. Here and there, however, a solitary
student of the art lingered, and the department of this
article on " Modern Alchemy " will demonstrate that the
science has to a great extent revived during modem
times, although it has never been quite extinct.
The (J11ests of Alchemy. The grand objects of alchemy
were (1) the discovery of a process by which the baser
metals might be transmuted into gold and silver ; (z),
the discovery of an elixir by which life might be prolonged
indefinitely ; and there may perhaps be added (3), the
manufacture of an artificial process of human life. (For
the lalte, see ..Homuncuha.")
Alchemy
. The Theory and Philosophy of Alchemy. The first ob-
jects were to be achieved as follows : The transmutation
of metals was to be accomplished by a powder, stone, or
elixir often called the Philosopher's Stone, the application
of which would effect the transmutation of the baser
metals into gold or silver. dc~ending upon the length of
time of its application. Basmg their conclusions on a
profound cxanunation of natural processes and research
into the secrets of nature, the alchemists arrived at the
axiom that nature was divided philosophically into four
principal regions, the dry, the moist, the warm, the cold,
whence all that exists must be derived. Nature is also
divisible into the male and the female. She is the divine
breath, the central fire, invisible yet ever active, and is
typified by sulphur, which is the mercury of the sages,
which slowly fructifies under the genial warmth of nature.
The alchemist must be ingenuous, of a truthful disposition,
and gifted with patience and prudence, following nature
in every alchemical performance. He must recollect that
like draws to like, and must know how to obtain the seed
of metals. which is produced by the four elements through
the will of the Supreme l3eing and the Imagination of
Nature. We are told that the original matter of metals is
double in its essence, being a dry heat combined with a warm
moisture, and that air is water coagulated by fire, capable
of producing a universal dissolvent. These terms the
neophyte must be cautious of interpreting in their literal
sense. Great confusion exists in alchemical nomen-
clature, and the gibberish employed by the scores of
charlatans who in later times pretended to a knowledge
of alchemical matters did not tend to make things any
more clear. The beginner must also acquire a thorough
knowledge of the manner in which metals grow in the
bowels of the earth. These are engendered by sulphur,
which is male, and mercury, which is female, and the crux
of alchemy is to obtain their seed-a process which the
alchemistical philosophers have not described with any
degree of clarity. The physical theory of transmutation
is based on the composite character of metals, and on the
presumed existence of a substance which, applied to
matter, exalts and perfects it. This, Eugenius Philale-
thes and others call " The Light." The elements of
all metals are similar, differing only in purity and pro-
portion. The entire trend of the metallic kingdom is
towards the natural manufacture of gold. and the pro-
duction of the baser metals is only accidental as the result
of an unfavourable environment. The Philosopher's
Stone is the combination of the male and female seeds
which beget gold. The composition of these is so veiled
by symbolism as to make thcir identification a matter of
impossibility. Waite, summarising the alchemical process
once the secret of the stone is unveiled, says :
" Given the matter of the stone and also the necessary
vessel, the processes which must be then undertaken to
accomplish the magnum opus arc described with moderate
perspicuity. There is the calcination or purgation of the
stone, in which kind is worked with kind for the space of a
philosophical year. There is dissolution which prepares
the way for congelation, and which is performed during
the black state of the mysterious matter. It is accom-
plished by water which does not wet the band. · There is
the separation of the subtle and the gross, which is to be
performed by means of heat. ln the conjunction which
follows, the elements are duly and scrupulously combined.
Putrefaction afterwards takes place,
• Without which pole no seed may multiply.'
" Then, in the subsequent congelation the white colour
appears, which is one of the signs of success. lt becomes
more pronounced in cibation. ln sublimation !he body
is spiritualised, the spirit made corporeal. and aga10 a more
Alchemy
glittering whiteness is apparent. Fermentation afterwards
fixes together the alchemical earth and-water, and causes
the mystic medicine to flow like wax. The matter is then
augmented with the alchemical spirit of life, and the
exaltation of the philosophic earth 1s accomplished by the
natural rectification of its elements. When these pro-
cesses have been successfully completed, the mystic stone
will have passed through three chief stages characterised
by different colours, black, white, and red, after which it
is capable of infinite multication, and when projcctoo on
mercury, it will absolutely transmute it, the resulting gold
bearing every test. The base metals made use of must be
puri.fi.ed to insure the success of tbe operation, The process
for the manufacture of silver is essentially similar, but the
r~?urces o! the matt~r are not carried to so high a degree.
Accordmg to the Commentary on the Ancie1>1t War of
the Knights the transmutations performed by the perfect
stone are so absolute that no.trace remains of the original
metal. It cannot, however, destroy gold, nor exalt it
into a more perfect metallic substance ; it, therefore,
transmutes it into a medicine a thousand times superior
to any virtues which can be extracted from it in its vulgar
state. This medicine becomes a most potent agent in the
exaltation·of base metals."
There are not wanting authorities who deny that the
transmutation of metals was the grand object of alchemy,
and who infer from the alchemistical writings that the end
of the art was the spiritual regeneration of man. Mrs.
Atwood, author of A S.uggestive Inquiry i?tto the Hermetic
Mystery, and an American writer named Hitchcock are
perhaps the chief protagonists of the belief that by spiritual
processesakin to those of the chemical processes of alchemy,
t he soul of man may be purified and exalted. But both
commit the radical error of stating that the alchemical
writers did not aver that the transmutation of base metal
into gold was their ~nd end. None of the passages
they quote, is inconSIStent with the physical object of
alchemy, and in a work, The l'lfarrow of Alchemy, stated
to be by Eugenius Philalethes, it is laid down that the
real quest is for gold. It is constantly impressed upon
the reader, however, in the perusal of esteemed alchemical
works, that only those who are instructed by God can
achieve the grand secret. Others, again, state that a
tyro may possibly stumble upon it, but that unless he is
guided by an adept he has small chance of achieving the
grand arcanum. It will be obvious to the tyro, however,
that nothing can ever be achieved by trusting to the alle-
gories of the adepts or tlle many charlatans who crowded
the ranks of the art. Gold may have been made, or it
may not, but the truth or fallacy of the alchemical method
lies with modern chemistry. The transcendental view of
alchemy, however, is rapidly gaining ground, and pro-
bably originated in the comprehensive nature of the
Hermetic theory and the consciousness in the alchemical
mind that what might with success be applied to nature
could also be applied to man with similar results. Says
Mr. Waite: "The gold of the philosopher is not a metal,
on the other hand, man is a being who possesses ....ithin
himself the seeds of a perfection which he has never realiJ;ed,
and that he therefore corresponds to those metals which
the Hermetic theory supposes to be capable of develop-
ment. It has been constantly advanced that the con-
version of lead into gold was only the assumed object of
alchemy, and that it was in reality in search of a process
for developing the latent possibilities in the subject man."
At the same time, it must be admitted that t:1c cryptic
character of alchemical language was probably occasioned
by a fear on the part of the alchemical mystic that he might
lay himself open through his magical opinions to the rigours
of the law.

Reco~ds of AUeged Actual Transmutation. Several
records of alleged transmutations of base metals into gold
are in existence. These were achieved by Nicholas Flame!,
Van Helmont, Martini, Richthausen, and Sethon. For a
detailed account of the methods employed the reader is
referred to the several articles on these hermetists. In
nearly every case the transmuting element was a mysterious
powder or the " Philosophers' Stone."
Modem Alchemy. That alchemy has been studied in
modem times there can be no doubt. M. Figuier in his
L'Alchimie el les Alchimistes, dealing with the subject of
modem alchemy, as expressed by the initiates of the first
hall of the nineteenth century, states that many French
alchemists of his time regarded the discoveries of modem
science as merely so many evidences of the truth of the
doctrines they embraced. Throughout Europe, he says,
the positive alchemical doctrine had many adherents at
the end of the eighteenth century and the beginnin~ of the
nineteenth. Thus a "vast association of alchemists,"
founded in Wc.qtphalia in 1790, continued to flourish in th~
year 1819, under the name of the " Hermetic Socidy."
In r8,)7, an alchemist of Thuringia presented to the Societe
Industriclle of Weimar a tincture which he averred would
effect metallic transmutation. About the same time
several French journals announced a public course of
lectures on hermetic philosophy by a professor of the
University of Munich. He further states that many
Hanoverian and Bavarian families pursued in common
the search for the grand arcanum. Paris, however, was
regarded as the alchcmistical Mecca. There dwelt many
theoretical alchemists and " empirical adepts." The first
pursued the arcanum through the medium of books, the
others engaged in practical efforts to effect transmutation.
M. Figuier states that in the forties of last century he
frequented the laboratory of a certain Monsieur L., which
was the rendezvous of the alchemists of Paris. 'When
Monsieur L's pupils left the laboratory for the day the
modern adepts dropped in one by one, and Figuier relates
how deeply impressed he was by the appearance and
costumes of these strange men. ln the daytime be fre-
quently encountered them in the public libraries, buried
in gigantic folios, and in the evening they might be seen
pacing Ole solitary bridges with eyes fixed in vague con-
templation upon the first pale stars of night. A long cloak
usually covered their meagre limbs, and their untrimmed
beards and matted locks lent tltem a wild appearance.
They walked with a solemn and measured gait, and used
the figures of speech employed by the medireval illumines.
Their expression was generally a mixture of the most ardent
hope and a fixed despair.
Among the adepts who sought tbe laboratory of Monsieur
L., Figuier remarked especially a young man, in whose
habits and language he could see nothing in common
with those of his strange companions. He confounded the
wisdom of t11e alchemical .adept with the tenets of
the modern scientist- in the most singular fashion, and
meeting him one day at the gate of the Observatory.
M. Figuier renewed the subject of their last discussion,
deploring that "a man of his gifts could pursue the sem-
blance of a chimera." Without replying, the young adept
led him into the Observatory garden, and proceeded to
reveal to him the mysteries of modern alchemical science.
The young man proceeded to fix a limit to the researches
of the modern alchemists. Gold, he said, according to the
ancient authors, has three distinct properties: {I) that
of resolving the baser metals into itself, and interchanging
and metamorphosing all metals into one another ; {2) the
curing of afflictions and the prolongation of life; (3), as
a spiritus mundi to bring mankind into rapport with the
Alchemy 12 Alehiodus
suoermundane spheres. Modern alchemists, he continued,
re}ect the greater part of these ideas, especially those con-
nected with spiritual contact, The object of modern
alchemy might be reduced to the search for a substance
having the power to transform and transmute all other
substances one into another-in short, to discover that
medium so well known to the o~lchemists of old and lost
to us. This was a perfectly feasible proposition. In the
four principal substances of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon,
and azote, we have the tetYtUtll$ of Pythagoras and the
tetraJ:Yam of the Chal-tcans and Egyptians. All the sixty
elements are referable to these original four. The ancient
alchemical theory established the fact that all the metals
arc the same in their composilion, that all are formed from
sulphur and mercury, and that the difference between them
is according to the proportion of these substances in their
composition. Further, all the products of minerals
present in their composition complete identity with those
substanci'.S most opposed to them. Thus fulminating acid
contains precisely the same quantity of carbon, oxygen,
and azote as cyanic acid. and " cyanhydric " acid does not
differ from formate ammoniac. This new property of
matter is known as " isomerism." .M. Figuier's friend then
proceeds to quote in support of his thesis and operations
and experiments of !\1. Dumas, a celebrated F.rench savant,
as well as those of Prout, aud other English chemists of
standing.
Passing to consider the possibility of isomerism in
elementary as well as in compound substauces, he points
out to .M. Figuier that if the theory of isomerism can apply
to such bodies, the transmutation of metals ceases to be
a wild, unpractical dream, and becomes a scientific possibil-
ity, the transformation being brought about by a mole-
cular rearrangement.• Isomerism can be established in
the case of c.ompound substances by chemical analysis,
showing the identity of their constituent parts~ la the
case of metals it can l>e proved by the comparison of the
properties of isomeric bodies with the properties of metals,
m order to discover whether they have any common char-
acteristics. Such experiments, he continued, had been
conducted by ;\I, Dumas, with the result that isomeric sub-
stances were found to have equal equivalents, or equival-
ents which were exact multiples one of another. This
characteristic is also a feature of metals. Gold and osmium
have identical equivalents, as have platinum and iridium.
Tbe equivalent of cobalt is almost the same as that of
nickel, and the semi-equivalent of tin is equal to the
equivalent of the two preceding metals.
l\1. Dumas, speaking before the British Association, had
shown that when three simple bodies displayed great
analogies in their properties, such as chlorine, bromide,
and iodine, barium, strontium, and calciu.r.t, the chemical
equivalent of the intermediate body is represented by the
;).rithmetical mean between the equivalents of the other
two. Such a statement well showed the isomerism of ele-
mentary substances, and proved that metals. however
dissimilar in outward appearance, were composed of the
same matter differently arranged and proportioned. This
theory successfully demolishes the difficulties in the way
of transmutation. At;ain, Dr. Prout says that the chemieal
equivalents of nearly all elemcntat·y substances are the
multiples of one among them. Thus, if the ·equivalent -of
hydrogen be taken for the unit, the equivalent of eYeJ"y
other substance will be an exact multiple of it-carbon
will be represented by six, azote by fourteen, oxygen by
sixteen, zinc by thirty-two. But, pointed out :\1. Figuier's
friend, if the molecular masses in compound substances
have so simple a connection. does it not go to prove that
all natural bodies are formed of one principle, differently
arranged and condensed to produce all kno"''D compounds ?
If transmutation is thus theoretically possible. it only
remains to show by practical experiment that it is strictly
in accordance with chemical laws, and by no means in-
clines to the supernatural. At this juncture the young
alchemist proceeded to liken the action of the Philosophers'
Stone on metal.s to that of a ferment on organic matter.
When metals are melted and brought to red heat, a mole-
cular change may be produced analogous to fermentation.
Just as sugar, under the influence of a ferment, may be
changed into lactic acid without altering its constituents,
so metals can alter their character under the influence of
the Philosophers' Stone. The explanation of the latter
case is no more difficult than that of the former. The
ferment does not take any part in the chemical changes it
brings about, and no satisfactory explanation of its effects
can be found either in the laws of affinity or in the forces
of electricity, light. or heat. As with the ferment, the
required quantity of the Philosophers' Stone is infinitesimal.
Medicine, philosophy, every modern science was at one
time a source of such errors and extravagances as are
associated with medireval alchemy, but they arc not
therefore neglected and despised. Wherefore, then. should
we be blind to the scientiric nature vf transmutation ?
One of the foundations of alchemical theories was that
minerals grew and developed in the earth, like organic
things. It was always the aim of nature to produce gold,
the most precious metal, but when circumstances were not
favourable the baser metals resulted. Tite desire of the
old alchemists was to surprise nature's secrets, and thus
attain the ability to do in a short period w!lat nature takes
years to accomplish. Nevertheless, the medireval alchem-
ists appreciated the value of time in their experiments as
modern alchemists never do. M. Figuier's friend urged
him not to condemn these exponents of the hermetic
philosophy for their metaphysical tendencies, for, he said,
there arc facts in our sciences which can only be explained
in that light. If, for instance, copper be placed in air or
water, there will be no result, but if a touch of some acid
be added, it will oxidise. The explanation is that " the
acid provokes oxidation of the metal, because it has an
affinity for the oxide which tends to form "-a material
fact almost metaphysical in its production, and only
explicable thereby.
He concluded his argument with an appeal for tolerance
towards the medireval alchemists, whose work is under-
rated because it is not properly understood. (Su also

Atchindi : (See Arabs.)
Alehindus : An Ar:>.bian doctor of the eleventh century,
placed by some autho1ities among the number of magicians,
but regarded by others as merely a superstitious writer.
He used charmed words and combinations of figur.-s in order
to cure his patients. Demonologists maintained that the
devil was responsible for his power, and based their state-
ments on the fact that he had written a work entitled The
Theory of the .'\ifagic Arll'. He was probably, however,
nothing more formidable than a natural philosopher at a
Aldinach 13 Alexander
time when all matter of science and philosophy were held
in susp1cLon. Some of his theories were of a magical nature,
it is true, as when he essayed to explain the phenomena of
dreams by saying that they were the work of the elementals,
who acted their strange fantasies before the mind of the
sleeper as actors play in a theatre. But on the whole there
is little to c01mect him with the practice of magic.
Aldlnaeb : An Egyptian demon, whom the demonologists
picture as presiding over the tempests, earthquakes, rain-
storms, hail-storms, etc. It is he, also, who sinl-s ships.
When he appears in visible form be takes the shape of a
woman.
Aleetorius : This stone is about the siEe of a bean. clear as
crystal, sometimes with veins the cqlour of flesh. It is said
to be taken from the cock's stomach. It renders its O\\o"'tler
courageous and invincible, brings him wealth, assuage;;
thirst, and makes the husband love his wife, or, as another
author has it, ·• m:J.kcs the woman agreeable to her hus-
band." But its most wonderful property is, that it helps
to regain a lost kingdom and acquire a foreign one.
Alectryomancy, or Alectormancy : An ancient method of
di\'inotion with a cock. In practising it, a circ:le mu~t be
made in a good close place, and this must be divided equally
into as mr.ny parts as tlu~re are letters in the alphabet.
Then a wheat-corn must be placed on every letter, beginning
with A, during which the dcpo~itor mnst repeat a certain
verse. This must be done when the sun or moon is in Aries
or Leo. A young cock, all white, should then be taken,
his claws should be cut off, and these he should be forced
to swallow with a little scroll of parchment made of lamb-
skin upon which has been previously written certain words.
Then the diviner holding the cock should repeat a form of
incantation. Next, on placing the cock within the circle,
be must repeat two verses of the Psalms, which arc exactly
the midmost of the seventy-two verses mentioned under
the head of " Onimancy," and it is to be noted on the
authority of an ancient Rabbi, that there is nothing in
these seventy-two which is not of some use in the kaba-
listical secret. The cock being within the circle, it must
be observed from which letters he pecks the grains, and
upon these others must be placed, because some names
and words contain the same letters twice or thrice. These
letters should be written down and put together, and they
will infallibly reveal the name of the person concerning
whom inquiry bas been made; it is said, though the story
is doubted, that the magician lamhlicus used this art to
discover the person who should succeed Valens Caesar
in the empire, but the bird picking up but four of the grains,
those which lay on the letters T h eo, left it uncertain
whether Theodosius, Tbcodotus, Thcodorus, or Theodectes,
was the person designed. Valens, however, learning
what had been done, put to death several individuals
whose names unhappily began with those letters, and the
magician, to avoid the ,flfl'ects of his resentment, took a
draught of poison. A kind of Alectromancy was also some-
times practised upon the crowing of the cock, and the
periods at which 1t was heard.
Ammianus Marcellinns describes the ritual which ac-
companied this act rather differently. The sorcerers
commenced by placing a basin made of different
metals on the ground and drawing around it at equal
distances the letters of the alphabet. Then he who
possessed the deepest occult knowledge, advanced, en-
veloped in a long veil, holding in his band branches of
vervain, and emitting dreadful cries, accompanied by
hideous convulsions. He stopped all at once before the
magic basin, and became rigid and motionless. He struck
on a letter several times with the branch in his hand, and
then upon another, until he had selected sufficient letters
to form a heroic verse, which was then given out to
the assembly. The Emperor Va!Ms, informed of this
circumstance, was ill-pleased that the infernal powers
should have been consulted regarding his destiny. Indeed,
he went further, for with unexampled severity, he pro-
scribed not only all the sorcerers, but a!l the philosophers
in Rome, and punished them so severely that many per-
ished.
In the fourth song of the Caquet Bonbec, of Jonquieres,
a poet of the fourteenth century, the details of an operatioa
in Al~ctryomancy arc exactly and curiously set forth.
Aleu:omancy : A species of divination practised with flour.
Sentences were written on slips of paper, each, of which
was rolled up in a little ball of flour. These were thoroughly
mixed up nine times, and divided amongst the curious.
who were waiting to learn their fate. Apollo, who was
supposed to presid.e over this form of divination, was
sum:1.med Aleuromantis. So late as the nineteenth
century the custom lin:;ered in rcmoter districts.
Alexander ab Alexandra : (Alessandro Alessandri.) A
Neapolitan lawyer, who died in 1523. He published a
dissertation on the marvellous, entitled De Rebus Admira·
biiibtts, in which he recounts prodigies which happened in
Italy, dreams which were verified. the circumstances
connected with many apparitions and phantoms, which he
says that he beheld himself. He followed this dissertation
with his celebrated work Gc11ialium Dierum, in which he
recounts with much credulity many prodigious happenings.
He tells how one evening he set out to join a party of
several friends at a house in Rome whicb had been haunted
for a long time by spectres and demons. In the middle of
the night, when all of them were assembled in one chamber
with many lights, there appeared to them a dreadful spectre,
who called to them in a loud voice, and threw about the
ornaments in the room. One of the most intrepid of the
company advanced in front of the spectre bearing a light,
on which it disappeared. Several times afterwards the
same apparition re-entered through the door. Alexander,
who had been lying on a couch, found that the demon had
slid underneath it, and on rising from it, b,e beheld a great
black arm appear on a table in front of him. By this time
several of the company had retired to rest, and the lights
were out, but torches were brought in answer to their cries
of alarm, on which the spectre opened the door, slid past
the advancing domestics, and disappeared. Alexander
visited many other haunted houses, but he appears to have
been easily duped, and by no means the sort of person to
undertake psychical research. (See Avlcenna.)
Alexander of Tralles : A physician born at Tralles in Asia
Minor, in th'e sixth century, very learned, and v.-ith a leaning
towards medico-magical practice. He prescribed for his
patients amulets and charmed words, as, for instance,
when be says in his Practiu of Medicine that the figure
of Hercules strangling the Nemcan lion, graven on a stone
and set in a ring, was an excellent cure for colic. He also
claimed that charms and philacteries wert! efficacious
remedies for gout, fevers, etc.
Alexander the Paphlagonian : The oracle of Abonotica, an
obscure Paphlagonian town, who for nearly twenty years
held absolute supremacy in the empirical art. Born about
the end of the second centnry, a native of Abonotica, he
possessed but little in the way of worldly wealth. His sole
capital consisted in his good looks, fine presence, exquisite
voice, and a certain talent for fraud, which he was soon to
turn to account in an extraordinary manner. His idea
was to institute a new oracle, and be fixed upon Chalcedoo
as a suitable place to commence operations. Finding no
great encouragement there he made a fresh start by setting
afoot a rumour to the effect that Apollo and his son iEscula·
pius intended shortly to take up residence at Abonotica.
Naturally, the rumour at length reached the ears of his
Alexander 14 Alis de Telieux
fellow-townsmen, who promptly set to work on a temple
meet for the reception of the gods. The way was thus
prepared for Alexantkr, who proceeded to Abonotica,
diligently advertising his skill as a prophet, so that on his
arrival people from many neighbouring towns applied to
him, and ere long his fame had spread as far as Rome. We
are told that the Emperor Aurelius himself consulted
A!e.~a11der before undertaking an important military
enterprise.
Lucinn gives a suppositious explanation of the Paphla-
gonian prophet's remarkable popularity. Alexander, he
says, came in the course of his early travels to Pella, in
.Macedon, where he found a unique breed of serpents, large,
beautiful, and so tame and harmless that they were allowed
by the inhabitants to enter their houses and p!ay with
children. A plan took shape in his brain which was to
help him to attain the fame he craved. Selecting the
largest and finest specimen of the :\Iacedonian snakes that
he could find, he carried it secretly to his destination. The
temple which the credulous natives of Abonotica had
raised to Apollo was surrounded by a moat, and Alex-
a1!der, ever ready to seize an opportunity wherever it
presented itself, emptied a goo;;e-egg of its contents, placed
within the shell a newly-hatched serpent, and sunk it in
the moat. He then impressively informed the people that
Apollo had arrived. :\laking for the mpat with all speed.
followed by a curious multitude, he scooped np the eaa,
and in fuU view of the people, broke the shell and expo;ed
to their admiring eyes a little, wrig~ling serpent. When
a few days had elapsed he judged the time ripe for a second
demonstration. Gathcrin_g together .a hUge crowd from
every part of Paph!agoma, he emerged from the temple
with the large ;\Iacedonian snake coiled about his neck.
Dy an ingenious arrangement the head of the serpent was
concealed under the prophet's arm, and an artificial head,
somewhat resembling that of a hum:~.n being, allowed to
protrude. The assembly was much astonished to find that
the tiny serpent of a few days ago had already attained
such remarkable proportions and possessed the face of a
human being, and they appeared to have little doubt that
it was indeed Apollo come to Abonotica.
By means of ingenious mechaniC;\! contrivances the
serpent was apparently made to reply to questions put
to it. In other cases s:?alcd rol!s containing the questions
were handed to the oracle and returned with the seals
intact and an appropriate answer written inside.
His audacity and ready im·ention enabled Alexander to
impose at will upon the credulous people of his time, and
these, combined with a strong and attractive personality,
won, and preserved for him his rem:ukable popularity, as
they have done for other " prophets" before and since.
Alfarabl : (d. 954·) An adept of remarkable gifts and an
extensive knowledge of all the sciences; born at Othrar
(or, as it was then called, Faral), in Asia xliuor. His name
was Abou-Nasr-11ohammed-Ibn-Tarkaw, but he received,
from the town of his birth, his better-l<nown appellation
of Farabi, or Alfarabi. Though he was of Turkish extrac-
tion, a desire to perfect himself in Arabic, led him to
Bagdad, where he assiduously studied the Greek philoso-
phers under Abou Bachar Maltey. He next stayed for a
time in Hanan, where he learned logic from a Christian
physician. Having far surpassed his fellow-scholars, he
left Hanan and drifted at last to Egypt. During his
wanderings he came in contact with all the most learned
philosophers of his time, and himself wrote books on
philosophy, mathematics, astromony, and other sciences,
besides acquiring proficiency in seventy languages. His
treatise on music, proving the connection of sound with
atmospheric vibrations, and mocking the Pythagorean
theory of the music of the spheres, attained some celebrity.
He gained the good-will and patronage of the Sultan
of Syria in a somewhat curious fashion. While passing
through Syria he visited the court of the Sultan, who was at
that moment surrounded by grave doctors and astrologers,
who were discussing abstruse scieptific points with the
potentate. A lfarabi entered the presence of the Sultan in
his stained and dusty travelling attire (he had been on a
pilgrimage to Mecca), and when the prince bade him be
seated, he, either unaware of, or indifferent to the etiquette
of court life, sat down boldly on a corner of the royal sofa.
The monarch, unused to such an informal proceeding,
spoke in a little-known tongue to a courtier, and bade him
remove the presumptuous philosopher. The latter, how-
ever, astonished him by reP.lying in the same language :
"Sire, he who acts hasbly, in haste repents." The
Sultan, becotning interested in his unconventional guest,
questioned him curiously, and learned of the seventy
languages and other accomplishments of A Ifarabi. The
sages who were present were also astounded at his wide
learning. When the prince called at length for some music,
Alfarabi accompanied the musicians on a lute v.itb such
marvellous skill and grace tltat the entire company was
charmed. W:hen he struck up a lively measure, the gravest
sages could not but dance to it. When he changed the
melody to a softer lilt, tears sparkled in every eye, and at
last, with a gentle lullaby, he put the court to sleep. The
Sultan wished to keep such a valuable philosopher about
his court, and some say that Alfarabi accepted his patronage
and died peacefully in Syria. Others, again, maintain that
he informod the Sultan that he would uevcr rest till he had
discovered the secret of the Philosophers' stone, which he
believed himself on the point of finding. These say that
he set out, but was attacked and killed by robbers in the
woods of Syria.

Alis de TelieulC : In 1528, there was published in Paris a
curious book, entitled, La mcrveille£1Se histoire de l'esprit
qui, d~puis nagdcre, s'est appartl all monastere des religicuses
de Sai11t Pierre de Lyon, !aq11eUe esl plei1111 de grande ad-
miration, comme 011 pourra vois par Ia leclure de ce pr~sent
livre, par Adrien de ftfontalembert, aumonier du roi Fran-
~ois fer. This work dealt with the appearance in the
monJ.stery of the spirit of Alis de Telieux, a nun who had
lived there before the reformation of the monastery in 1513.
A/is, it seems, had led rather a worldly life, following
pleasure and enjoyment in a manner unbecoming to a nun,
finally stealing the ornaments from the altar and selling
them. After this last enormity, she, of course, left the
monastery, and for a time continued her disgraceful career
outside, but before she died she repented of her sins, and
th-rough tlte intercession of the Vugin, received pardon.
This, however, did not gain for her Christian burial, and
she was interred without the usual prayers and funeral rites.
A number of years afterwards, when the monastery was
occupied by other and better nuns, one of their number, a
girl of about eighteen years, was aroused from her s;leep
by the apparition of Siskr A lis. For some time afterwards
the spirit haunted her wherever she went, continually rap-
ping_ on _the ground _near where she stood, and. ev~n <?Om-
mumcating with the mterested nuns. From all1nd1catlons,
it was a good and devout spirit who thus _entered !be
monastery, but the good sisters, well versed Jn the Wiles
of the devil, had their doubts on the subject. The services
of the Bishop of Lyons and of the narrator, Adrien de
Montalembert, were called in to adjure the evil spirit.
After many prayers and formalities, the spirit of Alis was
All Hallow's Eve 15
found to be an innocent one, attended by a guardian angel.
She answered a number of questions regarding her present
state and her desire for Christian burial, and confirmed the
doctrines of the Catholic Church, notably that of purgatory,
which latterspirit-revelation the author advances triumph-
antly for the confusion of the Lutherans. The remains of
Sister Alis were conveyed to consecrated ground, and
prayers made for the release of her soul from purgatory,
but for some reason or other she coutinued to follow the
young nun for a time, teaching her, on her last visit, live
secret prayers composed by St. John the Evangelist.
All Hallow's Eve : One of the former four great Fire festivals
iu Britain, is supposed to have taken place on the xst of
)\ovembcr, when all fires. save those of the Druids, were
extinguished, fro:n whose altars only the holy fire must be
purchased by. the householders for a certain price. The
festiva:! is still known in Ireland as Samhein, or La Samon,
i.e., the reast of the Sun, while in Scotland, it has assumed
the name of Hallowe'en. All Hallow's Eve, as observed in
the Church of Ro:nc, corresponds with the Feralia of the
ancient Romans. when they sacrificed in honour of the
de.'\d, offered up prayers for them. and tnade oblation~ to
them. In ancient times, this festival wa!-1 celebrated on the
twcnty-iirst of February, bul the Roman Church tran~fetred
itin her calendarto the first of November. It was originally
designed to give rest and peace to the souls of the departed.
In some parts of Scotl:\nd, it is still customary for young
people to kindle ftrcs on the tops of hills and rising grounds,
and fire o! this description goes by the name of a " Hallow-
e'en bleeze." Formerly it was customary to surround these
bonfires with a circular trench symbolical of the sun.
Sheriff Barclay tells us that about seventy years ago, while
travelling from Dunkeld to Abcrfeldy on Hallowe'en, he
counted thirty fires blazing on the hill tops, with the
phantom figures of persons dancing round the flames.
In Perthshire, the " Hallowe'en bleeze" is made iu the
following picturesque fashion. Heath, broom, and dres-
sings :If lbx arc tied upon a pole. The faggot is t.hen
kindled; a youth takes it upon his shoulders and carries
it about. When the faggot is burned out a second is tied
to the pole and kindled in the same manner as the former
one. Several of these blazing fag~ots are often carried
through the villages at the same ttme.
" Hallowe'en" is believed by the superstitious in Scot-
land to be a night on which the invisible world has peculiar
power. His Satanic Majesty is supposed to have great
latitude allowed him on this anniversary, in common with
that malignant class of beings known as witches, some of
whom, it is said, ma.y be seen cleaving the air on broom-
sticks, in a manner wondrous to behold. Others again,
less aerially·disposed, jog comfortably along over by-road
and heath, seated on the back of such sleek tabby cats as
have kindly allowed themselves to be transformed into
coal-black steeds for ttu!ir accommodation. The green-
robed fays arc also said to hold special festive meetings at
their favourite haunts. The ignorant believe that there is
no such night in nil the year for obtaining an insight into
futurity. The following arc the customs pertaining to this
eve of mystic ceremonies : The youths and maidens, who
engage in the ceremony of Pulling the Green Kail, go hand-
in-hand, with shut eyes, into a bachelor's or spin,ter's
garden, and pull up the first " ka.il stalks" wllich come in
their way. Should the stalks thus secured prove to be of
stately growth, straight in stem, and with a goodly supply
of earth at their roots, the future husbands (or wives) will
be young. goodlooking and rich io proportion. But if the
stalks be stunted, crooked, and have little or no earth at
their roots. tile future spouses will be found lacking in good
looks and fortune. According as the heart or stem proves
sweet or" sour to the taste, so will be the temper of the
All Hallow's Eve
future partner. The stalks thus tasted are afterwards
placed above the doors of the respedive houses, and the
christian names of those persons wll.o first pass under-
neath will correspond with those of the future husbands
or wives.
There is a.lso the custom of Eating the Apple at the Gbss.
Provide yourself with an apple, and, as the clock strikes
twelve, go alone into a room where there is a looking glass.
Cut the apple into small pieces, throw one of them over
your left shoulder, and advancing to the mirror without
!ouking back, proceed to cat the remainder, combing your
hair carefully the while before the glass. While thus en-
gaged, it is S<Ud that the face of the person you are to marry
will be seen peeping over your left shoulder. This " Hal-
lowe'en" game ts supposed to be a relic of that form of
divination with mirrors which was condemned as sorcery
by the former Popes.
The Buming Nttts. Take two nuts and place them in
the fire, bestowing on one of them your own name ; on the
other that of the object of your affections. Should they
burn quietly away, side by side. then the issue of your love
affair will be prosperous; but if one starts away from the
other, the result will be unfavourable.
And for the Sowing Hemp Seed, steal forth alone towards
midni~ht and sow a handful of hemp seed, repeating the
followmg ~hyme :
" Hemp seed, I sow thee, hemp seed, I sow thee ;
And he that is my true love, come behind and harrow me."
Then look over your left shoulder and you will see tile
person thus adjmed in the act of harrowing.
The ceremony of Winnowing Corn must also be gone
through in solitude. Go Lo the barn and open both doors,
taking th..:m off thehingesif possible,lest the being you expect
to appear, may close them and do you some injury. Then
take the instrument used in winnowing corn, and go through
all the attitudes of letting it down against the wind. Re-
peat the operation three times, and the figure of your
future partner will appear passing in at one door and out
at the other. Should those engaging in this ceremony be
fated to die young, it is believed that a coffin, followed by
mourners, will enter and pursue the too adventurous youth
or maiden, who thus wishes to pry into the hidden things
of the future, round the barn.
Another is :'lleasuring the Bean Stack. Go three times
round a be-.an stack with outstretched arms, as if measuring
it, and the third time you will clasp in your arms the shade
of your future partner.
Eating the HerYing. Just before retiring to rest eat a
raw or roasted sail herring, and in your dreams your hus-
band (or wife) that is to be, will come and offer you a drink
of water to quench your thirst.
Dipping the Shirl Sleeve. Go alone, or in company with
others, to a stream where" three lairds' lands meet," and
dip in the left sleeve of a shirt; after this is done not one
word must be spoken, otherwise tile spell is broken. Titen
put your sleeve to dry before your bedroom fire. Go to
bed, but be careful to remain awake, and you will see the
form o[ your future helpmate enter and turn the o;leeve
in order that the other side may get dried.
The Three Pla.tes. Place three plates in a row on a tahle.
In one of these put clean water, in anoth.-r foul, and leave
the third empty. Blindfold the person wishing to try his
or her fortune, and lead them up to the table. The left
hand must be put forw.ud. Should it come in contact
with the clean water, then the future spou~e will be young,
handsome, and a bach'!l.:>r or maid. The toul signifies a
widower or a widow: and the empty dish, single blessed-
nes;. Thi.~ ceremony is repeated three times, and the
plates must be differently arranged after each attempt.
Throwing the Clue. Steal forth alone and at night, to
Allantara 16 Alruy
the nearest hme-kiln, and throw io a clue of blue yam,
winding it off on to a fresh clue. As you come near the
end, someone 'vill grasp hold of the thread lying in the kiln.
You then ask, "Who holds?" when the name of your
future partner will be ·uttered from beneath.
Allantara : (See Spain.)
Allat : Wife of Allah, and joint ruler with him over the
Chaldean Hell. ~l. :.raspero describes her as " the lady
of the great country where all go after death who have
breathed here below," and as their terrible judge.
Allen Kardec : (See Spiritualism.)
Alli Allabis : A continuation of the old sect of the Persian
Magi, (q.v.).
Allmuseri : An African secret society with secret rites akin
to those of the Cabiric and Orphic Mysteries. Their
reception takes place once a year in a wood, and the candi-
date is supposed to die. The Initiates surround the
Neophyte and chant funereal songs. He is then brought
to the temple erected for the purpose, and anointed with
palm oil. After forty days of probation, he is said to have
obtained a new soul, is greeted with hymns of joy, and
conducted home. (See Hcckethom, Secret Societies.)
Alludels : (See Arabs.)
Almadel : (See Key ol Solomon.)
Almagest : (See Astrology.)
Almanacb du Dlable : An almanac containing some very
curious predictions for the years 1737 and 1738, which
purported to be published in the infernal regions. It is a
satire against the Jansenists, which was suppressed on
account of some over-bold predictions, and which bas
become very rare. The authorship was ascribed to Quesnel,
an ironmonger at Dijon. The Jansenists replied with a
pamphlet directed against the Jesuits, which was also
suppressed. It was entitled Almanac de Dieu, dedicated to
)!. Carre de Montgeron, for the year 1738, and, in contra-
distinction to the other, claimed satirically to be printed in
heaven.
Almoganenses : The name given by the Spaniards to certain
people who, by the flight and song of birds, meetings with
wild animals, and \'arious other means, foretold coming
events, whether good or evil. " They carefully preserve
among themselves," says Laurent Valla, " books which
treat of this science, where they find rules of all sorts of
prognostications and predictions. The soothsayers are
divided into two classes, one, the masters or principals,
the other the disciples and aspirants."
Another kind of knowledge is also attributed to them,
that of being able to indicate not only the way taken by
horses and other beasts of burden which are lost, but even
the road followed by one or more persons. They can
specify the kind and shape of the ground, whether the
earth is hard or soft, covered with sand or grass, whether it
is a broad road, paved or sanded, or narrow, twisting paths,
and tell also how many passengers arc on the road. They
can thus follow the track of anyone, and cause thieves to be
pursued and apprehended. Those writers who mention
the A lmoganetiSes, however, do not specify either- the period
when they 1lourished, or the country or province they
occupied, but it seems possible from their name and other
considerations that they were )!oorisb.
Alocer : A powerful demon, according to Wierius, Grand
Duke of Hades. He appears in the shape of a knight
mounted on an enormous horse. His face has leonine
characteristics; he has a ruddy complexion and burning
eyes; and be speaks with much gravity. He is said to
give family happiness to those whom he takes under his
protection, and to teach astronomy and liberal arts. Thirty-
six legions are controlled by him.
AJomancy : Divination by means of salt, of which process
little is known. It is this science which justifies people in
saying that misfortune is about to fall on the household
when the salt cellar is overturned.
Alopecy : A species of charm by the aid of which one can
fascinate an enemy against whom he bas a grudge, and
whom he 'l'tishes to harm.
Alphabet, Magical : (See Kabala.)

Alpbltomancy : A method of divination carried out with the
help of a loaf of barley, which has been practised since the
earliest days. It was used to prove the guilt or innocence
of a suspected person. \Vben many persons were accused
of a crime, and it was desired to find the true culprit, a loaf
of barley was made and a portion given to each of the sus-
pected ones. The innocent people sufiered no ill-effects,
while the criminal betrayed himself by an attack of indiges-
tion. This practice gave rise to a popular imprecation:
•· If I am dccch·ing you, may this piece of bread choke
me." By means of it a lover might know if his mistress was
faithful to him, or a wife, her husband. The procedure was
as follows: A quantity of pure barley ftour was kneaded
with milk and a little salt, and without any leaven. It was
then rolled up in greased paper, and cooked among the
cinders. It was afterwards taken out and rubbed with
verbena leaves, and given to the person suspected o£
deceit, who, if the suspicion was justified, wou!d be unable
to digest it.
There was said to be near Lavinium <rsacred wood, where
Alphitomancy was practised in order to test the purity of
the women. The priests kept a serpent, or, as some say, a
dragon, in a cavern in the wood. On certain days of the
year the young women were sent thither, blind-folded,
and carrying a cake made of barley fiour and honey. The
devil, we are told, led them by the right road. Those who
were innocent had their cakes eaten by the serpent, while
the cakes of the others were refused.
Alp:el : An angel or demon, who, according to the Talmud,
presides over fruit-trees.
Alraun : Images made of the roots of the ash tree, which are
sometimes mistakenly called mandrakes, (q.v.)
AIrunes : Female demons or sorceresses, the motherS of the
Huns. They took aU sorts of shapes, but "ithout changing
their sex. The name was given by the Germans to littl&
statues of old sorceresses, about a foot high. To these they
attributed great virtues, honouring them as the negroes
honour their fetishes ; clothing them richly, housing them
comfortably, and serving them with food and drink at every
meal. They believed that if these little images were
neglected they would cry out, a catastrophe which was to be
avoided at all costs, as it brought dire misfortunes upon
the household. They may have been mandrakes, and it was
claimed for them that they could foretell the future, ans-
wering by means of motions of the head, or unintelli~ble
words. They are still consulted in Norway.
Alruy, David : A Jewish magician, mentioned in his Voyage.s
b,r Benjamin the Jew. Alruy ooasted himself a descendant
of King David. He was educated in Bagdad, receiving
instruction in the magic arts to such good purpose that he
came to be more proficient than his masters. His false
miracles gained so much popularity for him that some of
the Jews believed him to be that prophet who.was to
restore their nation to Jerusalem. The King of Persia
caused him to be cast into prison, but no bolts and bars
could hold for long so redoubtable a magician. He escaped
from his prison and appeared before the eyes of the aston-
ished king, though the courtiers standing round saw noth-
ing, and only heard his voice. In vain the king calledangrily
for someone to arrest the imposter. No one could see him,
and while they groped in search of him, like men blind-
folded, he slipped from the palace, with the king in pursuit,
all the amazed assembly running after their prince. At
Altbotas 17
length they reached the sea shore, and A/my turned and
showed himself to all the people. Then, spreading a scan
on the surlace of the water, he walked over it lightly, before
the b?3-ts which were to pursue him were ready. This
adventure confirmed his reputation as the greatest magician
who ~ad lived within the memory of man. But at ~t a
Turkish prince, a subject of the Persian king, bribed the
father-in-law of the sorcerer to kill him, and one night,
when Alruy was sleeping peacefully in his bed, a dagger
thrust put an end to his existence.
Altbot~s : The presumed " master " . and companion of
Cagliostro. Co~iderable doubt has been expressed re-
garding his existence. Figuier states that he wcs no
imaginary character; that the Roman Inqilisit~on collected
many proofs of his existence, but none as regards his origin
or end, as he vanished like a meteor. " But," states th~
French author, " he was a magician and doctor as well,
possessed divinatory abilities of a high 9rder, was in pos-
session of several Arabic manuscripts, and had great skill
in chemistry." His connection with Cagliostro will be
found detailed in the article on that a4ept. Eliphas Levi
states that the name Alth.otas is comP.osed of the word
" thot " with the syllables " al " and "'as," which if read
cabalistically are sala, meaning messenger or envoy ; the
name as a whole therefore signifies " Thot, the Messenger
of the Egyptians," and such, says Levi, in effect he was.
Alth.otas has been sometimes identified with Kolmer, the
instructor of Weishaupt in magic, and at other times with
the Comte de Sainte-Germain (both of whom see). ft
would indeed be difficult to say with any definiteness
whether or not & /th.otas was merely a figment of Cagliostro's
brain. The accounts concerning him are certainly con-
dieting, for whereas Cagliostro stated at his trial in Paris
thatA lth.otas had been his lifelong preceptor,anotheraccount
says that he met him first on the quay at Messina, atid the
likelihood is that his character is purely fictitious, as there
does not appear to be any exact evidence that he was ever
encountered in the fiesh by anyone.
Alu-Demon : This Semitic demon owes his parentage to a
human being ; be bides himself in caverns and comers, and
slinks through the streets at night. He also lies in wait
for the unwary, and at night enters bed-chambers and
terrorises folks, threatening to pounce upon the:n if they
shut their eyes.
Amadeus : A visionary who experienced an apocalypse and
revelations, in one of which he learned the two psalms
composed by Adam, one a mark of joy at the creation of
Eve, and the other the dialogue be held with her after they
had sinned. Both psalms are printed in Fabricius' Codex
Pseudepi_s:raph.us Veteris Testamenti.
Amaimon : One of the four spirits who preside over the four
parts of the universe. A maimon, according to the magic-
Ians, was the governor of the eastern part.
Amandlnus : A variously coloured stone, which enables the
'v~rer of it to solve any question concerning dreams or
emgrnas.
Amaranth : A flower which is one of the symbols of immortal-
ity. It has been said by magicians that a crown made with
this flower has supernatural properties, and will bring fame
and favour to those who wear it.
Ambassadors, Demon : (See Demonology.)
Amdusclas : Grand Duke of Hades. He has, according t o
Wierius (q.v.), the form of a unicorn, but when evoked,
appears in human shape. He gives concerts, at the com-
mand of men, where one hears the sound of all the musical
instruments but can see nothing. It is said that the trees
themselves incline to his voice. He commands twenty-
nine legions.
America. United States of : Occultism amongst the aborig-
inal tribes of America will be found dealt with under the
America
articl~ North-American Indians." The occult history of
the European races which occupy the territory now known
as the United States of America does not commence until
some little time after their entrance into the North Ameri-
can continent. It is probable that the early English
and Dutch settlers carried with them the germs of the
practice of witchcraft, but it is certain that they brought
with them an active belief in witchcraft and sorcery. It
is significant, however, that no outbreak of fanaticism
occurred in connection with this belief until nearly the end
of the seventeenth century, in 16<)2, when an alarm of
witchcraft was raised in the family of the Minister of Salem,
and se':'eral black servants were charged with the supposed
crime. It is quite likely that these negroes practised
voodoo or obeah (q.v.), but, however this may be, the
charges did not stop at them. The alarm spread rapidly,
and in a brief space numerous persons fell under suspicion
on the most frivolous pretexts. Tbe new Governor of the
Colony, Sir William Phipps, appears to have been carried
away with the excitement, and authorised judicial prose-
cutions. The first person tried, a woman named Bridget
Bishop, was hanged, and the Governor feeling himself
embarassed among the extraordinary number_of charges
made after this, called in the assistance of the clergy of
Boston. As events proved, this was a fatal thing to do.
Boston, at this time, rossesse<l a distinguished family of
puritanical millisters o the name of Mather. The original
Mather had settled in Dorchester in 1636, and three years
laterhad a son born to him, whom he calledIncrease Mather,
He became a clergyman, as did his son, Cotton Mather,
born in 1663. Increase was President of Harvard College,
and his son occupied a distinguished position therein, and
also preached at Boston. The fanaticism and diabolical
cruelty of these two men has probably never been equalled
in the history of human persecution. Relying implicitly
upon the scriptural injunction : " Thou shalt not suffer a
witch to live," and blinded by their fanatic zeal, they cost
the colony many precious lives. Indeed, beside their
regime, the rigours of Sprenger (q.v.) and Bodin (q.v.), pale
into insignificance. That ministers professing to preach
a gospel of charity and love could have so far descended as
to torture and condemn thousands of human beings to the
gallows and the stake, can only be regarded as astounding.
In t688 an I rish washer woman, named Glover, was em-
ployed by a mason of Boston, one Goodwin, to look
after his children, and these shortly afterwards displayed
symptoms whlch Cotton ~father, on examination, stated
were those of diabolical possession. The wretched washer-
woman was br.ought to trial, found g_uilty, and banged ;
and Cotton :\'lather launched into print upon the case
under the title of Late Memorable Prqvidences Relating to
Witchcraft and Pqssession which displayed an extraordinary
amount of ingenuity and an equally great lack of anything
like sound judgment. As was the case with the works of
the European writers on witchcraft and sQrcery, this book
fanned the Jlame of credulity, and thousands of t he ignor-
ant throughout the colony began to cast about for similar
examples of witchcraft. Five other persons were brought
to trial and executed, and a similar number shortly met
the same fate. among them a minister o! the Gospel, by
name GeorgeBorroughs, who disbelieved in witchcraft. Thls
was sufficient, and he was executed forthwith. Popular
sentiment was on his side, but the fiendish Cotton Mather
appeared at the place of execution on horseback, denounced
Borroughs as an impostor, and upheld the action of his
judges. Another man, called Willard. who had been
employed to arrest suspected witches, refused to continue
in hls office, and was himself arrested. He attempted to
save himself by flight, but was pursued and overtaken, and
duly executed. Even dogs accused of witchcraft were put
America 18
to death, but the magistrates who had undertaken the
proceedings, ignorant as they were, began to have _some
suspicion that the course they had adopted was a VIolent
and dangerous one, and popular sentiment rose so high that
the Governor requested Cotton }lather to write a treatise
in defence of what had been done. Tho result was the
famous volume, Wonders of the fnvisible World, in which
the author gives an account ofseveral of the trials at Salem,
compares the doings of witches in New England with those
in other parts of the ~world, and d1scourses elaborately on
witchcraft generally. The witch mania now spread
throughout the whole colony. One of the first checks it
received was the accusation of the wife of ::O.Ir. Hale, a
minister. Her husband had been a zealous promotor
of the prosecutions, but this accusation altered his views,
and he became convinced of the injustice of the whole
movement. But certain P!lrsons raised the question ~s to
whether the Devil could not assume the shape of an 1nno·
cent and pious person as well as a wicked one for his own
purposes, and the assistance of Increase :\lather, President
"
of Harvard College, was called in to decide this. He wrote
a book, A Fz~rther Auount of the Tria's of the Nerv England
Witches, and added many cases concerning witchcraft and
evil spirits personating men, in the course o( which he un-
hesitatingly affirmed that it was possible for the enemy
of mankind to assume th_e guise of a person in whom there
was no guile. A new scene of agitation was the town of
Andover, where a great many persons were accused of
witchcraft and thrown into prison, until a certain justice
of the peace. named Bradstreet, who deserves special
mention for his enlightened policy, refused to grant any
more warrants for arrest. The accusers immediately
fastened upon him, and declared that he had killed several
people by means of sorcery, and so alarmed was he that he
fted !rom the town. But the fanatics who made it their
business to accuse, b¢came bolder, and aimed at persons
of rank, until at last they had the audacity to impeach
the wife of Governor Phipps himself. This withdrew from
them the countenance of the Governor, and a certain
Bostonian who was accused, brou~ht an action of damages
against his accusers for defamation of character. After
this, the whole agitati.on died down, and scores of persons
who had made confessions retracted ; but the Mathers
obstinately persisted in the opinions they had published,
and regarded the reactionary feeling as a triumph of Satan.
A Boston girl, named Margaret Rule, was seized with con-
vulsions, and when visited by Cotton Mather, was found by
him to be suffering from a diabolical attack of obsession.
He did his best to renew the agitation, but to no purpose,
for a certain Robert Calif, an infiuential merchant of the
town, also examined the girl, and satisfied himself that the
whole thing was a delusion. He penned an account o(
his examination exposing the theories of the Mathers,
which is published under the title of Jforc Wonder~ of the
Invisible World. This book was publicly burned by the
partisans of the fanatical clergy, but the eyes of the public
were now opened, and opinion generally was steadfastly
aga.in~t the accusation and pro;t'cution of reputed witches.
The people of Salem drove from their midst the minister.
Paris, with whom the prosecution had begun, and a deep
remorse settled down upon the community. Indeed, most
of the persons concerned in the judicia! proceedings pro-
claimed their regret ; the jurors signed a paper stating
their repentance and pleading delusion. But even all this
(ailed to convince the Mathers, and Cotton wrote his
111agnalia, an ecclesiastical history of Xew England, pub-
lished r;oo, which repeats his original view of the power
of Satan at Salem, and evinces no regret for the part he had
taken in the matter. In r723, he edited The Remarkables
of his father, in which he took occasion to repeat his theories.
America
Increase Mather died in z723, at the age of eighty-five, and
Cotton lived on to 1728. It has been claimed that they
acted according to their lights and conscience, but there
is no doubt that their vanity would not permit them to
retract wh:lt they had once set down regarding witchcraft,
and their names will go down to posterity with those of the
inquisitors and torturers of the middle ages, as men, who
\vith less excuse than these, tormented and bereft of life
hundreds of totally innocent people.

ualism, where a full summary of the subject will be found.
Apart from the doings at Salem, colonial America has
little to offer in the way of occult history : but the modern
United States of America is extremely rich in occult history.
This, however, is a history of outsta;1ding individuals-
Thomas Lake Harri3, Brigham Young. the Foxes, Andrew
J ack.;on Davis, and so on, biographies of whom will be
found sc1ttered throughout this work. But that is not to
say that various occult movements have not from time to
time either originated in, or found a home in the United
States. Indeed, the number of occult or semi-occult sects
which have originated there, is exceedingly great, and the
founda.tion of occult communities has been frequent.
Such were the Mountain Cove community of Harris; the
Society of Hopedale, founded by Ballou: and so on. The
notorious community, or rather nation of Mormons had
undoubtedly a semi-occult origin. It~; founder, Joseph
Smith, and its .first great prophet, Brigham Young. both
had OCC\llt ideas, which rather remind us of those of Blake
(q.v.), and were decidedly of biblical origin. Smith pur·
ported to discov('r tablets of bras<; upon which was en-
graved the new law. This was the germ of the Booli of
Morman tile Prophet, and a certain pseudo-my<;ticism was
associated with the :\[ormon movement. This, however,
wore off after a while. More fresh in the recollection are
the blasphemous absurdities of the prophet Dowie, who
purported to be a prophet of the new Christianity, and
succeeded in amassing very considerable wealth. Later,
however, he became discredited, and many of his disciples
seceded from him. Sects of Adventists have also been
fairly numerous. These persons at the call of their
leaders have met in cemeteries and elsewhere arrayed
in white robes. in the belief that the Last Day had arrived;
but finding themselves duped, they invariably turned upon
the charlatans who had aroused these false hopes. There
is an instance on record, however, where one such person
succeeded in bringing about the repetition of such a scene-.
Theosophy, as will be seen in the central article on that
subject, owes much to America, for it may be said that in
the United States it received an almost novel interpreta-
tion at the hanrls of William Q. Judge, and Katherine B.

Lorna, California.
The United States is frequently alluded to as the home
and birth-place of " queer " religions par excellence.
If Paris be excepted this charge holds good, for nowhere
is pseudo-occultism so rife. It would ind~ed be difficult
to account for this state of things. Shrewd as the
average American is, there is no question that he is
prone to extremes, and the temper of the nation as a whole
is not a little hysterical. Such sects are often f~t!nded by
unscrupulous foreign adventurers, and worshtppers of
Isis. d1abolic societies and such-like abound in the larger
cities, and even in some of the lesser communities. But
on the other hand many such cults, the names of which for
obvious reasons we cannot mention here, are of native
Ame1ican origin. In course of time these duly invade
Europe, with varying fortunes. There exist, how-
ever, in America, numbers of cultured persons who
make a seriou~ study of the higher branche-s of mysticism
America 19
and occultism, and who compare favourably in erudition
and character with advanced European mystics. It might
indeed with truth be said that America has produced the
greatest occult leaders of tht> last quarter of a century.
A mtrican btdia11s. Among the various nativt' races
of the American continent, the supernatural has ever
flourished as universaUy as among peoples in an analo-
gous condition of civilisation in other parts of the
world. They will be treated in the present article accord-
ing to their geographical situation. Mexico, Central
America and Peru have been noticed in separate articles.
North Amtrican Indians. The oldest writers on the
North American Indians agree that they practised sorcery
and the magic arts, and often attributed this power of the
Indians to Satan. The Rev. Peter Jones, writing as late
as the first decade of the nineteenth century, says : " I
have sometimes been inclined to think that if witchcraft
still exists in the world, it is to be found among the abori-
gines of America." The early French settlers called the
Nipissing Jcmgletws because of the surprising expertness
in magic of tht>ir medicine men. Carver and Fletcher
observed the usc of hypnotic suggestion among the Menomi-
nee and Sioux about the middle of last century, and it is
generally admitted that this art, which is known to modern
Americanists as orenda, is known among most Indian tribes
as Mooney bas proved in his Ghost Da11ce Religion. Brinton,
alluding to Indian medicine-men and their connection
with the occult arts, says : " They were also adepts in
tricks of sleight of hand, and had no mean acquaintance
with what is called natural magic. They would allow
themselves to be tied hand and foot with knots innumer-
able, and at a sign would shake them loose as so many
wisps of straw ; they would spit fire and swallow hot coals,
pick glowing stones from the flames, walk with naked feet
over live ashes, and plunge their arms to the shoulder in
kettles of boiling water with apparent impunity.
" Nor was this all. With a skill not inferior to that of
the jugglers of India, they could plunge knives into vital
parts, vomit blood, or kill one another out and out to all
appearances, and yet in a few minutes be as well as ever ;
they could set fire to articles of clothing and even houses,
and by a touch of their magic restore them instantly as
perfect as before. Says Father Bautista : • They can make
a s6ck look like a serpent, a mat like a centipede, and a
piece of stone like a scorpion.' If it were not within our
power to see most of these miracles performed any night
in our great cities by a well-dressed professional, we should
at once deny their possibility. As it is they astonish us
but little.
" One of the most peculiar and characteristic exhibitions
of their power, was to summon a spirit to answer inquiries
concerning the future and the absent. A great similarity
marked this procecrling in all northern tribes, from the
Eskimos to the Mexicans. A circular or conical lodge of
stout poles, four or eight in number, planted firmly in the
ground was covered with skins or mats, a small aperture
only being left for the seer to enter. Once in, be carefully
closed the hole and commenced his incantations. Soon
the lodge trembles, the strong poles shake and bend as
with the united strength of a dozen men; and strange, un-
earthly sounds, now far aloft in the air, now deep in the
ground, anon approaching ncar and nearer, Ieach the ears
of the spectators.
" At length the priest announces that the spirit is present,
and is prepared to answer questions. Ah· indispensable
preliminary to any inquiry is to insert a handful of tobacco,
or a string of beads, or some such douceur under the skins,
ostensibly !or the behoof of the celestial visitor, who would
seem not to be above earthly wants and vanities. The
replies received, though occasionally singularly clear and
America
correct, are usually of that profoundly ambiguous purport
which leaves the anxious inquirer little wiser than he was
before.
" For all this, ventriloquism, trickery, and shrewd
knavery arc sufficient explanations. Nor does it mater-
ially interfere with this view, that converted Indians, on
whose veracity we can implicitly rely, have repeatedly
averred that in performing this rite they themselves did
not move the medicine lodge ; for nothing is easier than in
the state of nervous excitement they were then in to be
self-deceived, as the now familiar phenomenon of table-
turning illustrates.
" But there is something more than these vulgar arts
now and then to be perceived. There are statements sup-
ported by unquestionable testimony, which ought not
to be passed over in silence, and yet I cannot but approach
them with hesitation. They are so revolting to the laws
of exact sci<'ncc, so alien, I had almost said, to the experience
of our lives. Yet is this true, or are such experiences only
ignored and put aside without serious consideration ?
Are there not in the history of each of us passages which
strike our retrospective thought with awe, almost with
terror ? Are there not in nearly every community in-
dividuals who possess a mysterious power, concerning
whose origin, mode of action, and limits, we and they are
alike, in the dark ?
" I refer to such organic forces as are popularly summed
up under the words clairvoyance, mesmerism, rhabdom-
ancy, animal magnetism, physical spiritualism. Civilised
thousands stake their faith and hope here and hereafter,
on the truth of these manifestations; rational meclicine
recognises their existence, and while she attributes them
to morbid and exceptional inftuence.s, confesses her want
of more exact knowledge, and refrains from barren theoris-
ing. Let us follow her example, and hold it enough to
show that such powers, whatever they arc, were known to
the native priesthood as well as the modern spiritualists
and the miracle mongers of the Middle Ages.
"Their highest development is what our ancestors
called • second sight.' That under certain conditions
knowledge can pass from one mind to another othen~-ise
than through the ordinary channels of the senses, is shown
by the examples of persons en rapport. The limit to this
we do not know, but it is not unlikely that clairvoyance
or second sight is based upon it.''
In his autobiography, the celebrated Sac chief, Black
Hawk, relates that hls great grandfather " was inspired
by a belief that at the end of four years he should see a
white man, who would be to him a father." Under the
direction of this vision he travelled eastward to a certain
spot, and there, as he was forewarned, met a Frenchman,
through whom the nation \vaS brought into alliance with
France.
No one at all versed in the Indian character will doubt
the implicit faith with which this legend was told and
heard. But we may be pardoned our scepticism, seeing
there are so many chances of error. It is not so with an
anecdote related by Captain Jonathan Carver, a cool-
headed English trader, whose little book of travels is an
unquestioned authority. Jn 1767 he was among the
Killistcnoes at a time when they were in great straits
for food. and depending upon the arrival of the traders to
rescue them from starvation. They persuaded the chief
priest to consult the divinities as to when the relief would
arrive. After the usual preliminaries, their magnate
announced that the next day precisely, when the sun
reached the zenith, a canoe would arrive "'ith further
tidings. At the appointed hour, the whole vilage, to-
getherwith the incredulous Englishman, was on the beach,
and sure enough, at the minute specified, a canoe swung

the shore brought th.;) cx:pectc::l ne·.vs. Charlevoix is
nearly as trustworthy a wril~r as Car,•er. Yet he de·
libcrately relates an equally singular inst".ace.
But these examples are surpassed by one described in
the Atlantic Jlo11
1
11ly, of July 1866, the author of which,
the late Col. John ::\Iason Brown, has :e;t:lied to its
accuracy in every particular. Some years since at the
bead of a party of voyageurs. he set forth in search of a
band of Indians somewhere on the vast pb.ins along the
tributaries of the Copper-mine and ::\Iackenzie rivers.
Danger, disappointment, and the fatigues of the road,
induced one after another to turn back, until of the original
ten only three remained. They a!so were on the point
of giving up the appa,rently hopeless quest, when they were
met by some warriors of the very band they were seeking.
These had been sent out by one of their medicine men to
1ind three whites, whose horses, arms, attire, and personal
appearance he minutely described, which description was
repeated to Col. Brown by the warriors before they saw his
two companions. When afterwards, the priest, a frank
and simple-minded man, was asked to explain this extra·
ordinary occurrence, he could offer no other explanation
than that ·• he saw them coming, and heard them talk on
their journey."
Many tales such as these have been recorded by travellers,
and however much they m:~.y shock our sense of probability,
as well-authenticated exhibitions of a power which sways
the Indian mind, and which has ever prejudiced it so un·
changeably against Christianity and civilisation, they can-
not be disregarded. Whether they too are but spec.••nens
of refined knavery, whether they are instigations of the
devil, or whether they must be classed with other facts as
illustrating certain obscure and curio!ls mental faculties,
each may decide as the bent of his mind inclines him, for
science makes no decision.
Those nervous conditions associated with the n~me of
~iesmer were nothing new to the Indian magicians. Rub·
bing and stroking the sick, and the laying on of hands, were
very common parts of their clinical procedures, and at the
initiations to their societies they were frequently exhibited.
Observers have related that among the ~ez Perces of
Oregon, the novice was put to ~Jeep by songs. incantations,
and "certai:l. pac;ses of the band," and that with the
Dakotas he would be struck lightly on the bre:lSt at a pre-
concerted m~ment, and instantly •· woulti drop prostrate
on his face, his muscles rigid and quivering in every fibre."
There is no occasion to suppose decc:it in this. It finds
its parallel in every race and every age, and rests on a
characteristic trait of certain epochs and certain men,
which leads them to seek the divine, not in thoughtful con-
templation on the laws of the universe and the facts of
self-consciousness, but in an entire immolation of the
latter, a sinking of their own individuality in that of
the spirits whose alliance they seek.
The late Washington Mathews, writing in Bulletin 30 of
the Bureau of American Ethnology, says ;
" S!eight-of·hand was not only much employed in the
treatment of disease, but was used on many other occasions.
A very common trick am:>ng Indian charhtans was to
pretend to suck foreign bo:lies, such as stones, out of the
persons of their patients. Records of this are found among
many tribes, from the lowest in culture to the highest, even
among the Aztecs. Of course, such trickery was not with·
out some therapeutic efficacy, for, like m'lny other pro-
ceerlings of the sham:~.ns, it was designed to cure disease by
influence on the imagination. A Hidat;'l, residing in
Dakota, in 1865, was known by the nam~ of Cherry-in-the-
mouth, because he had a trick of producing from his mouth,
at any s~ason, what seemed to be fresh wild cherries. He
America
had found some way of pre3erving cherries, perhaps in
whisky, and it was easy for him to hide them in his mouth
before intending to play the trick : but many of the In-
dians considered it wonderful mas;ic.
·• The most astonishing tricks of the Indians were dis-
played in their fire ceremonies and in handling hot sub-
stances, accounts of which performances pe1 tain to various
tribes. It is said that Chippewa sorcerers could handle
with impunity red-hot stone3 and burning brands, and
could bathe the hands in boiling water or syrup; such
magicians were called · fire-dealers ' and • fire·handlers.'
There are authentic accounts from various parts of the
world of fire·dancers and fire-walks among barbarous races,
and extraordinary fire acts are performed also among
widely separated Indian tribes. Among the Arikara of
what is now :::-Torth Dakota, in the autumn of 1865, when
a large fire in the centre of the medicine lodge had died
down until it became a berl of glowing embers, and the light
in the lodge was dim. the performers ran with apparently
bare feet among the hot coals and threw these around in the
lodge with their bare hands, causing the spectators to ftee.
Among the ~ahavo, performers, naked except for breech-
cloth and moccasins, and having their bodies daubed with a
white infusorial clay, run at high speed around a fire, hold-
ing in their hand~ greatfaggots of !laming cedar bark, which
they apply to the bare backs o.l those in front of them and
to their own persons. Their wild race around the fire is
continued untii the faggots are nearly all consumed, but they
are never injured by the flame. This immuoity m:~.y be ac-
counted for by supposing that the cedar bark does not
make a very hot fire, and that the clay coating protects the
body. :\Ienominee shamans arc said to handle fire, as also
are the female sorcerers of Honduras.
" Indians know well how to handle venomous ;;erpents
with impunity. lf they can not avoid being bitten, as
they usually can, they seem to be able to avert the fatal
consequences of the bite. The wonderful acts performed
in the Snake Dance of the Hopi have Qften been described.
" A trick of Navaho dancers, in the ceremony of the
mountain chant, is to pretend to thrust an arrow far down
the throat. In this feat an arrow with a telescopic shaft
is used : the point is held between the teeth; the hollow
part of the handle, covered with plumes, is forced down
toward the !ips, and thu3 the arrow appears to beswallowed.
There is an account of an arrow of similar construction
used early in the eighteenth century by Indians of Canada,
who pretended a man was wounded by it and healed in-
stantly. The Xavaho also pretend to swallow sticks,
which their neighbours of the peublo of Zuni actually do
in sacred rites, occasionally rupturing the <:esophagus in the
ordeal of forcing a stick into the stomach. Special societies
which practise magic, having for their chief object rain-
making and the cure of disease, exist among the south-
western tribes. Swallowing sticks, arrows, etc., eating
and wal~ng on fire, and trampling on cactus, are per-
formed by members of the same fraternity.
"Magicians are usually men; but among the aborigines
of the Mosquito Coast in Central Americ3., they ·are often
women who are called sttkia<, and are said to exercise great
power. According to Hewitt, Iroquois women are reported
tra::litional!y to have been magicians.
"A trick of the juggler among many tribes of the North
was to cause himself to be bound hand and foot and then,
without visible assistance or effort on his part to release
him~elf from the bonds. Civilised conjurers who perform
a similar trick are hidden in a cabinet, and claim super-
natural aid; but some Indian jugglers performed this
feat under observation. It was common for Indian magic-
ians to pretend they could bring rain, but the trick con-
sisted simply of keeping up ceremonies until rain fell, the
America 21
last cf'remony being the one credited with success. Catlin
describes this among the ).fandan, in 1832, :1.nd the practice
Lc: still common among the Pueblo tribes of the arid region.
The rain-maker was a speeial functionary among the
Menominee.
" To cause 'I large plant to grow to maturity in a few
moments and out of season is another Indian trick. The
Navaho plant the root stalk of a yucca in the ground in the
middle of the winter, and apparently cause it to grow,
blossom, and bear fruit in a few moments. This is done
by the use of artificial flowers and fruit carried :.mdt:r the
blankets of the pl'rformers ; the dimness of the firelight
and the motion of the surrounding dancers hide from the
spectators the operations of the shaman when be exchanges
one artificial object for another. In this way the Hopi
grov,. beans, and the Zuni corn, the latter using a large
cooking pot to cover the growing plant."
South America11 lndia11s. Throughout South America
the magician caste analogous to the medicine men or
shamans of North America are known as pia;es or piaes.
Of those of British Guiana, Brett writes;
" They are each furnisher! with a L
arge gourd or calabash,
which has been emptied of its seeds and spongy contents,
and has a round stick run through the middle of it by means
of two holes. The ends of this stick project-one forms
the handle of the instrument, and the other has a long
string to which beautiful feathers are attached, wound
round it in spiral circles. Within the calabash are a few
small white stones, which rattle when it is shaken or
turned round. The calabash itself is usually painted red.
lt is regarded with great awe by the heathen Indians, who
fear to touch it, or even to approach the place where it is
kept.
" When attacked by sickness, the Indians cause them·
selves to be conveyed to some friendly sorcerer, to whom a
present of more or less value must be made. Death is
sometimes occasioned by those removal-;, cold being taken
from wet or the damp of the river. If the P.'tient cannot
be removed, the sorcerer is sent for to vJ.Sit him. The
females are all sent away from the place, and the men must
keep at a respectful distance, as he does not like his pro-
ceedings to be closely inspected. He then commences his
exorcisms, turning, and shaking his marakka, or rattle
and chanting an address to the yaulzall!l. This is con·
tinued for hours, uritil about midnight the spirit is sup-
posed to be present, and a conversation to take place, which
is unintelligible to the Indians, who may overhear it.
These ceremonies are kept up for successive nights.
" If the patient be strong enough to endure the disease,
the excitemer.t, the noise. and the fumes of tobacco in
which he is at times enveloped, and the sorcerer observe
signs of recovery he will pretend to extract the cause of
the complaint by sucking the part affected. After many
ceremomes he will produce from his mouth some strange
substance, such as a thorn or gravel-stone, a fish-bone
or bird's claw. a snake's tooth, or a piece of wire, which
some malicious yauflalzu is supposed to have inserted in the
affected part. As soon as the patient fancies himself rid
of this cause of his illness his recovery is generally rapid,
and the fame of the sorcerer greatly increased. Should
death, howe\'er, ensue, the blame is laid upon the evil
spirit, whose power and malignity have prevailed over the
counteracting charms. Some rival sorcerer will at times
come in for a share of the blame. whom the sufferer has
unhappily made his enemy, and who is supposed to have
employed the yau!Jaltu it\ destroying him. The sorcerers
being supposed to have the power of causing, as well as of
curing dtseases. are much dreaded b)• the common people,
who never wilfully offend them. So deeply rooted in the
Indian's bosom is tl.is b:!lief concerning the origin of
America
diseases, that they have little idea of sickness arising from
other causes. Death may arise from a wound or a con-
tusion, or be brought on by want of food, but in other cases
it is the work of the yauhalzu.
" I once came upon a Warau practising his art upon a
woman inflicted with a severe internal complaint. He
was, when I first saw him, blowing violently into his hands
and rubbing them upon the affected part. He very
candidly acknowledged his imposture when I taxed him
with it, put up his implements, and went away. The fate
cf the poor woman, as it was relate.1 to me some time a.fter·
wards, was very sad. Though a VenezuPian half-breed,
and of the Church of Rome, she was wedded to the Indian
superstitions, and after trying the · most noted sorcerers
without relief, she inflicted on herself a mortal wound
with a razor in the vain attempt to cut out the imaginary
cause of her internal pain.
"Some have imagined that those men have faith in the
power of their own incantations from their performing them
over their own children, and even causing them to be acted
over themselves when sick. This practice it is indeed
difficult to account for. The juggling part of their busi-
ness is such a gross imposture as could only succeed with
a very ignorant and credulous people; but it is perhaps
in their case, as in some others, difficult to tell the precise
point where ctedulity ends and imposture begins. It is
certain that they arc excited during their incantations in a
most extraordinary way, and positively affirm that they
hold intercourse with spirits ; nor will they allow them·
selves to be laughed out of the assertion however ridiculous
it may appear to us.
" The Waraus, in many points the most degraded of the
tribes, arE" the most renowned as sorcerers. The huts
which they set apart for the performance of their super·
stitious rites are regarded with great veneration.
•· l\Ir. Xowers, on visiting a \Varau settlement, entered
one of those huts, not being aware of the offence he was
committing, and found it perfectly empty, with the exccp·
tion of the gourd, or malaro, as it is called by the tribe.
There was, in the centre of the hut, a small raised place
about eighteen inches high, on which the fire had been
made for burning tobacco. The sorcerer being asked to
give up the gourd, P.eremptorily refused, saying that if he
did so his • two cluldren would die the same night.' "
Keller, in his Amololl a,:d .\1adeira Riv~rf, says: " As
with the shamans of the North Asiatic nations, the influence
a Paj<.i may secure over his tribe depends entirely on the
success of his cures and his more or less imposing personal
qualities. Woe to him if by some unlucky ministration
or fatal advice he forfeits his prestige. The hate of the
whole tribe turns against him, as if to indemnify them for
the fear and awe felt by them until then ; and often he
pays for his envied position with his Life.
" And an influential and powerful position it is. His
advice is first heard in war and peace. He has to mark
the boundaries of the hunting-grounds; and, when quarrels
arise, he has to decide in concert with the chieftain, some-
times even against the httcr's wishes. By a majestically
distant demeanour, and by the affectation of severe fasting
and of nightly meetings with the spirits of another world,
these augurs have succeeded in givmg such an appearance
of holiness to the whole caste, that their influence is a
mighty one to the present day, even with the Indians of
the Aldeamentos, where contact with the white race is sure
by-and-by to produce a certain degree of scepticism.
"When I was at the Aldcamento of San Ignacio, on the
Paranapanema, Cuyaba, chieftain and Paje of an indepen-
dent horde of Cayowa Indians made his appearance, and
I had the honour of being introduced to this magnificent
sample of :1. conjurer. He was a man of about fifty, with
America 22 Amethyst
large well-cut features, framed within a dense, streaming
mane of long black hair. The long ~erimbita on his under
lip (a long, thin, cylinder of a resin resembling amber), a
great number of black and white beads covering his chest
in regular rows like a cuirass, and a broad girdle holding
his cherapi (sort of apron), which was fringed all round
with rich, woven ornaments, gave him quite a stately,
majestic appearance."
Their magicians were called by the Cbilians gligua or
dugol, and were subdivided into guengue111t, genpugm' and
genpi.m, meaning respectively •· masters of the he3vens,"
"of epidemics," and ·' of insects or worms." There was
also a sect called C<llcu, or" sorcerers," who dwelt in caves,
and who were served by ivunches, or " m~n-anirnals," to
whom they taught their terrible arts. The Araucanians
believed that these wiUtrds had the power to transform
themselves at night into nocturnal birds, to fiy through
the air, and to shoot invisible arrows at their enemies,
b~ide:; indulging in the malicious mischief with which
folklore credits the wir.ar(ls of all countries. Their priests
proper they believed to possess numerous familiars who
were attached to them after death-the belief of the
" magicians " of the l\Iidd!e Ages. These priests or
diviners were celibate, and Led an existence apart from
the tribe, in some communities being garbed as women.
Many tales are told of their magical prowess, which lead us
to believe that they were either natural epileptics or
ecstatics, or that disturbing mental influences were brought
about in their case by the aid of drugs. The Araucanians
also held that to mention their real personal names gave
magic power over them. which might be turned to evil ends.
Regarding the wizards of the inhabitants of the territory
around the River Chaco, in Paraguay, :\Ir. Barbrooke-
Grubb in his book, A11 Unlmow11 People i11 an Unk1zown
Land, says:
" The training necessary to qualify an Indian to become
a witch-doctor consists, in the first pla~. in severe fastings,
and especially in abstention from fluid. They carry this
fasting to such an excess as to affect the nervous system
and brain. Certain herbs are eaten to hasten this stage.
They pass days in solitude, and, when thoroughly worked
up to an hysterical condition, they see spirits and ghosts,
and have strange visions. Tt is necessary, furthermore,
that they should eat a few live toads and some kinds of
snakes. Certain little birds are plucked alive and then
devoured, their power of whistling being supposed to be
thus communicated to the witch-doctor. There are other
features in the preliminary training which need not be
mentioned, and when the Initiatory stage has been satis-
factorily passed, they are instructed in the mysteries
under pledge o~ secrecy. After that their future depends
upon themselves.
" It is unquestionable that a few of these wizards under-
stand to a slight degree the power of hypnotism. They
appear at times to throw themselve~ into a hypnotic state
by sitting in a strained position for hours, tixing their gaze
upon some distant ObJeCt. In this condition they are
believed to be able to throw their souls out- that is. in
order to make them wander. It seems that occasionally,
when in this state, they see visions which are quite the
opposite of those they had desired. At other times they
content themselves with concentrating their attention for
a while upon one of their charms, and I have no doubt that
occasionally they are sincere in desiring to solve some
perplexing problems.
" One of the chief duties of the wizard is to arrange the
weather to suit his clansmen. If they want rain it is to
him they apply. His sorceries are of such a kind that they
~ay be extended ove~ a long period. He is never lacking
m excuses, and so, while apparently busy in combating the
opposing forces wh1ch are hindering the rain, he gains time
to study weather signs. He will never or rarely venture
an opinion as to the expected change until he is nearly
certain of a satisfactory result. Any other Indian could
foretell rain were he to observe signs as closely as does
the wizard. The killing of a certain kind of duck, and the
sprinkling of its b!ood upwards, is his chief charm. When
he is able to procure tb1s bird he is sure that rain cannot
be far off, because these ducks do not migrate southwards
until tbey know that there is going to be water in the
swamps. Thes:: swamps are filled by the overflowing of the
rive.
rs a.s much as by the local rainfalls, and the presence
of water in the rivers and swamps soon attr
..cts rain-clouds.
" The ~ovizards also observe plants and animals, study
the sky and take note of other phenomena, and by these
means can arrive at fairly S'!.fe conclusions. They are
supposed to be able to foretell events, and to a certain
extent they succeed so far as these events concern local
interests. Dy judicious questioning and observation, the
astute wizard is able to judge with some amount of exacti-
tude how certain matters are likely to turn out.
" After we had introduced bullock-carts into their
country, the people were naturally interested in the return
of the carts from tbeir periodical journeys to the river.
When the wizards had calculated carefully the watering-
places, and had taken into consideration the state of the
roads, the character of the drivers, and the condition and
number of the bullocks, all that they then required to know
was the weight of the loads and the day on which it was
expected that the carts would leave the river on their
return journey. The last two items they had to obtain
from us. 'When they had these data, by a simple calcula-
tion they could make ;, very shrewd guess, not only at the
time when they might be expected to arrive at the village,
but also at what particular part of the road they might
happen to be on any given day. A great impression was
made upon the simple people by this exhibition of po,ver,
but when we discovered what they were doing, we with-
held the information, or only gave them part, with the
result that their prophecies either failed ignominiously or
proved very erroneous. Their reputation accordingly
began to wane.
·· The wizards appear to be authorities on agricultural
matters, and wben application to the garden spirit has
failed, the 'ritch-doctor is called in. He examines the
crop, and if he thinks it is likely to be a poor one, he says it
is being blighted by an evil spirit, but that he will use what
sorceries he can to preserve it. If, on the other hand, he
bas reason to believe that the crop will be a good one, he
spits upon it here and there, and then assures the people
that now they may expect a good harvest.
.. Some of the chief duties of the witch-doctor consist in
laying ghosts, driving off spirits, exorcising kilyil•hama in
cases of possession assisting wandering souls back to their
bodies, and generally in the recognising of spirits. When a
ghost is suppos.cd to haunt a villag<', the wizard and his
assistants have sometimes an hour's arduous chanting, in
order to induce the restless one to leave. When he con-
siders that he has accomplished this, he assures the people
that it is done, and this quiets their fears. Evil spirits
frequenting a neighbourhood have also to be driven. off by
somewhat similar chanting."
Amethyst : •· This gem," says Camillus Leonardus, "is
reckoned among the purple and transparent stones, mixed
with a violet colour, emitting rosy sparkles." The Indian
variety is the most precious. When made into drinking
cups or bound on the navel. it prevented drunkenness.
It is also held to sharpen the wit, turn away evil thoughts,
and give a knowledge of the future in dreams. Drunk in
a potion, it was thought to expel poison and render the

barren fruitful. It wa~ frequently engraved with the head
of Bacchus, and was a favourite with the Roman ladies.
Amiante : A species of fire-proof stone, which Pliny and the
demonologists recommended as an excellent speci.fic against
the charms of magic.
Amniomancy : Divination by means of the caul, or meQl-
branc which sometimes envelopes the head of a child at
birth. From an inspection of this caul, the wise women
predict the sort of future the baby will have. If it be red,
happy days are in store for the child, or if le-ad-coloured,
he will have misfortunes.
Amon : A great and powerful marquis of the infernal empire.
He is represented as a wolf tvith a serpent's tail, vomiting
flame. When he appears in human form, his head re-
sembles that of a large owl with canine teeth. He is the
strongest.of the princes of the demons, knows the past and
t he future, and can reconcile, when he will, friends who
have quare!led. He commands forty legions.
Amoymon : One of the four kings of Hades, of which the
eastern part falls to his share. lie may be invoked in the
morning from nine o'clock till midday, and in the evening
from three o'clock till six. He has been identified with
Amaimon (q.v.) Asmodeus (q.v.) is his lieutenant, and
the first prince of his dominions.
Amphlaraus : A famous soothsayer of ancient times, who. hid
himselfso that he might not have to go to the war of Thebes,
because he had foreseen that he should die there. This,
indeed happened, but he came to life again. A temple
was raised to him in .Attica, near a sacred fountain by which
he had left Hades. He healed the sick by showing them
in a dream the remedies they must use. He also founded
many oracles. After sacrifice, those who consulted the
oracle slept under a sheep skin, and dreamed a dream which
usually found plenty of interpreters after the event. Am-
phiayaus himself was an adept in the art of explaining
dreams. Some prophecies in verse, which are no longer
extant, arc attributed to him.
Amulets : The charm, amulet, or mascot, is, of course,
directly derived from the conception of the fetish {q.v.),
which was believed by savage and semi-barbarous peo_ple
to contain a spirit. Amulets may be said to be of two
classes: those which arc worn as (I) fetishes, that is the
dwelling-place of spiritual entities, who are active on
behalf of the wearer; or {2), mascots to ward oft bad luck
or such influences as the evil eye.
That charms were worn by prehistoric man there is little
ro·om for doubt, as objects which in many cases partake
of the appearance and general description of amulets are
discovered in neolithic tombs. The ancient Egyptians
possessed a bewildering variety of amulets, which were worn
both by the living and the dead. Indeed. among the latter,
every part of the body had an amulet sacred to itself.
These were, as a rule, evolved from various organs of the
gods : as, for example, the eye of Isis, the backbone of
Osiris, and so forth. Among the savage and semi-civilised
peoples, the amulet usually takes the form of a necklace,
bracelets·, or anklets, and where belie£ in witchcraft and
the evil eye is strong, the faith in these, and in charms, is
always most intense. Among <:ivilised races it has been
observed that it is usuaUy the ignorant classes who adopt
the use of amulets : such as sailors, miners, beggars,
Gypsies, and criminals. But amulets are also to be
found in use among educated persons, although, of
course, the superstitious part of the practice has in these
cases often disappeared. Universally speaking. stones,
teeth, claws, shells, coral and symbolic emblems, are
favoured amulets. The reason for the wearing of these is
exceedingly difficult to arrive at, but a kind of doctrine
of correspondences may be at the root of the belief- the
1dea that like produces like, or that an eff<!ct resembles its
cause, or that things which have once been in contact but
have ceased to be so, continue to act on each other by
magical means. For example, the desert goat is a sure-
footed animal; accordingly, its tongue is carried as a
powerful amulet against falling by certain Malay tribes.
Beads resembling teeth are often hung round the necks of
Kaffir children in Africa to assist them in teething, and the
incisor teeth of the beaver arc frequently placed round t he
necks of little American-Indian girls to render them in-
dustrious, like that animal. Again, certain plants and
minerals indicate by their external character the diseases
for which nature intended them as remedies. Thus the
cuphrasia, or eyebright, was supposed to be good for the
eyes because it contains a black pupil-like spot ; and the
blood-stone was employed lor stopping the tlow of blood
from a wound.
It is strange that wherever prehistoric implements, such
as arrowheads and c"lts, arc discovered, they are thought
by the pe~antry of the locality in which they are found t o
be of great virtue as amulets. Some light is cast on
this custom by the fact that stone arrowheads
were certainly in usc among mediawal British witches.
But in most countries they are thought to descend
from the sky, and are therefore kept to preserve
people and cattle from lightning. This does not, how-
ever, explain away the reason why water poured over
a prehistoric arrowhead is given to cure cows in Ire-
land. Certain roots, which have the shape of snakes. are
kept by the Malays to ensure them against snake-bite ;
and instances of this description of correspondence, known
as the doctrine of signatures, could be multiplied ad in-
finitum. Among the Celts a great many kinds of amulets
were used : such as the symbolic wheel of the sun god,
found so numerously in France and Great Britain ; pebbles,
amulets of the teeth of the wild boar, and pieces of amber.
The well-known serpent's egg of the Druids was also in all
probability an amulet of the priestly class. Indian amulets
are numerous, and in Buddhist countries their use is uni-
versal, especially where that religion has become degraded,
or has in any way degenerated. In Northern Buddhist
countries almost everyone constantly wears an a,mulet
round the neck. These generally represent the leaf of
the sacred fig-tree, and are made in the form of a box which
contains a scrap ofsacred writing, prayer, or a little picture.
Women of position in Tibet wear a chatelaine containing a
charm or charms, and the universal amulet of the Buddhist
priests in that country is the thunderbolt, supposed to have
fallen direct from lndra's heaven. This is usually imitated
in bronze or other metal, and is used for exorcising evil
spirits. Amulet types arc for the most part very ancient,
and present much the same characteristics in all parts of
the world.
Amy : Grand President of Hades, and one of the princes of
the infernal monarchy. He appears there enveloped with
flame, but ou earth, in human form. He teaches the
secrets of astrology and of the l~beral arts, and gives faith-
ful servants. He reveals to those who possess his favour,
the hiding-place of treasures guarded by demons. Thirty-
six of the infernal legions arc under his command. The
fallen angels acknowledge his orders, and he hopes that at
the end of zoo,ooo years, he shall return to heaven to occupy
the seventh throne.
Anachitis : Used in divination to call u_p spirits from water;
another stone, called synochitis, obliged them to remain
while they were interrogated.
Anamelech : An obo;.cure demon, bearer of ill news. He was
worshipped at Sepharvaiin, a town of the Assyrians. He
always reveals himself in the figure of a quail. His name,
we are told, 'igni.Ji.es a" good king," and someauthoritiesde-
clare that this demon is the moon, as Andramelech is the sun.
Ananclthidus 24: Angels
Anancithldus : Leonardus describes this as " a necromantic
stone, whose ,·irtue is to call up evil spirits and !(hosts."
Anania, or Agnany (Jean d') : A lawyer of the fifteenth cen-
tury, who wrote four books, entitled, De Natura Damo-
11Um, (On the Nature of Demons}, and a treatise on Magic
and Witchcraft, neither of which works are well known.
He died in Italy in r458.
Ananisapta : A Kabbalistic word made up from the initial
letters of the prayer: Antidctum Nazareui Auferat Neane
lntoxicalionis; Sanctificet Alimenta, Poculaque Trinitas
Alma. V\1hen written on virgin parchment, it is a powerful
talisman to protect against disease.
Anarazel : One of the demons charged with the guardianship
of subt.:rranean treasure, which he carries :ibout from one
place to another, to hide them from men. It is he who,
with his companions Caziel and F~cor, shakes the founda-
tions of houses. rais~s the tempests. rings the bt:Jis at mid-
night, rauses spectres to appear, and inspirr.s a thousand
terrors.
Anathema : The name was given by the ancients to certain
classes of votive o1Jerings, to the nets that the fisherman
lays on the altar of the sea-nymphs, to the mirror that
Lals consecrated to Venus; to offerings of vessels, gar-
ments. instruments, and various other articles. The word
was also applied to the victim devoted to the infernal
gods, and it is in this sense that it is found among Jews
and Christians, referring either to the curse or its object.
The man who is anathematized is denied communication
with the faithful, and delivered to the demon if he dies
without absolution. The Church has often lavished
anathemas upon its enemies, though St. John Chrysostom
has said that it is well to anathematize false doctrine, but
that men who have strayed should be pardoned and prayed
for. Formerly, magicians and sorcerers employed a sort
of anathema to discover thieves and witches. Some
limpid water was brought, and in it were boiled as many
pebbles as there were persons suspected. The pebbles
were then buried under the door-step over which the thief
or the sorcerer was to pass, and a plate of tin attached to
it, on which was written the words : " Christ is conqueror ;
Christ is king ; Christ is master." Every pebble must
bear the name of one of the suspected persons. The stones
are removed at sunrise, and that representing the guilty
person is hot and glowing. But, as the devil is malicious,
that is not enough. The seven penitential psalms must
then be recited, with the Litanies of the Saints, and the
prayers of exorcism pronounced against the thief or the
sorcerer. His name must be written in a circular figure,
and a triangular brass nail driven in above it with a hammer,
the handle of which is of cypress wood, the exorcist saying
meanwhile: "Thou art just, Lord, and just are Thy judg·
ments." At this, the thtef would betray himself by a loud
cry. If the anathema has been pronounced by a sorcerer,
and one wishes merely to escape the effects of it and cause
it to return to him who has cast it, one-must take, on
Saturday, before sunrise, the branch of a hazel tree of one
year, and recite the following prayc;r : " I cut thee, branch
of this year, in the name of..him whom I wish to wound as I
wound thee.'' The branch is then laid on the table and
other prayers said, ending with " Holy Trinity, punish
him who has done this evil, and take him from among us
by Thy great justice, that the sorcerer or sorceress may be
anathema, and we safe." Harrison Ainsworth's famous
novel, The La11ca$hire Witches, deals with the subject
and the Pendleton locality.

Angels : The word angel, ·• angelos" in Greek. " malak "
in Hebrew, literally signifies a " person sent" or a " mes-
senger." It is a name, not of nature but of office, and is
applied also to men in the world, as ambassadors or repre-
sentatives. In a lower sense, angel denotes a spiritual
being employed in occasional offices; and lastly, men in
office as priests or bishops. The " angel of the congrega-
tion," among the Jews, was the chief of the synagogue.
Such is the scriptural usage of a term, which. in common
parlance, is now limited to its principal meaning, and
denotes only the inhabitants of heaven.
The apostle of the Gentiles speaks of the angels as" minis-
tering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall
be heirs of salvation," in strict keeping with the import of
the term itself. In Mark i., 2, it is applied to John the
Baptist : '· Behold I send my messenger (· angel ') before
my face," and the word is the same (" malak ") in the
corresponding prophecy of Malachi. In Hebrews xii.,
22, 24, we read : " Ye have come to an innumerable
company of angels, to the spirits of the just," etc., and this
idea of their great number is sustained by the words of our
Lord himself, where, for example, he declares that " twelve
legions" of them were ready upon His demand. In the
Revelation of St. John, a vast idea of their number is given.
They are called the " armies" of heaven. Their song of
praise is described as " the voice of a great multitude, and
as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty
thunderings." In fine, the sense of number is over-
whelmed in the effort to compute them.
As to their nature, it is essentially the same as that of
man, for not only are understanding and will attributed
to them, but they have been mistaken for men when they
appeared, and Paul represents them as capable of disobe-
dience (Heb. ii., 7, t6.) The latter possibility is exhibited
in its greatest extent by Jude, who speaks of the "angels
whicfi kept not their first estate, but left their own habita·
tion," and upon this belief is founded the whole system
of tradition concerning angels and demons. The former
term was gradually limited to mean only the obedient
ministers of the will of the Almighty, and the ioftuence of
evil angels was concentrated into the office of the great
adversary of all good, the devil or Satan. These ideas were
commop to the whole Eastern world, and were probably
derived by the Jewish people from the Assyrians. The
Pharisees charged the Saviour with casting out devils " by
Beelzebub the prince of the devils." But that evil spirits
acted in multitudes under one person, appears from Mark
v., 9, where the evil spirit being asked his namE.', answered :
"My name is ' Legion • for we are many."
It is generally held that two orders are mentioned in
scripture, "angels" and " archangels" ; but the latter
word only occurs twice, namely, in Jude, where Michael is
called" an archangel," and in I. Thess. iv., 16, where it is
written : " the Lord shall descend from heaven with a
shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump
of Cod." This is a slender foundation to build a theory
upon. The prefix simply denotes rank, not another order
Angels 25
of intelligence. There is nothing in the who~e of Scripture,
therefore, to show that intelligent beings exist who have
other than human attributes. Gabriel and Michael are
certainly mentioned by name, but they appeared to Daniel,
Zacharias, and the Virgin Mary, in fulfilment of a function,
correspondent to the high purpose of which, may be the
greater power, wisdom, and goodness, we should attribute
to them ; and hence the fuller representation of the angelic
hosts, as chief ang-ls.
The mention of Michael by name occurs five times in
Scripture, and always in the character ofa chief m:litaht :-
In Daniel, he is the champion of the Jewish church against
Persia ; in the Revelation, he overcomes the dragon ;
and in Jude he is mentioned in personal conflict with the
devil about the body of Moses. He is called by Gabriel,
" Michael, your prince," meaning of the Jewish church.
In the alleged prophecy of Enoch, he is styled : " Michael,
one of the holy an~els, who, presiding over human virtue,
commands the nations " ; while Raphael, it says, '" pre-
sides oper the spirits of men " ; Uriel, " over clamour and
terror " ; and Gabriel, " over Paradise, and over the
ch.erubims." In the Catholic I!Crvices, St. Michael is
invoked as a " most glorious and warlike prince," .. the
receiver of souls," and " the vanquisher of evil spirits."
His design, according to Randle Holme, is a banner hang-
ing on a cross; and he is armed as representing victory,
with a dart in one hand and a cross on his forehead. Bishop
Horsley and others considered Michael only another
designation for the Son of God. We may add as a certain
biblicnl truth, that the Lord Himself is always meant, in
an eminent sense, by any tmgtl named as His minister;
and he is called the fl.tll(el of the Covenant, because he em-
bodied in his own person the whole power and representa-
tion of the angt>lic kingdom, as the messenger, not of
sepa.rate and temporary commands, but of the whole
Word in its fulness.
Pa:~lc;peaks of a" third heaven," which must be under-
stood not as a distinct order of created intelligences, but in
the same sense as the Lord's declaration : " In my Father"s
house are many mansions." For jesus Christ always
speaks of His kingdom as essentially one, even in both
worlds, the spiritual and natural.
Dionysius, or St. Denis, the supposed Areopagite, des-
cribes three hierarchies of angels in nine choirs, thus :
Seraphim, Cherubim, Th.rones, Dominions, Principalities,
Powers, Virtues, Angels, Archangels. And Vartan, or
Vertabied, the Armenian poet and historian, who flourished
in the thirteenth century, describes them under the same
terms, but expressly states: " these orders differ from
one another in situation and degree of glory, just as there
are different ranks among men, though they are all of one
nature." He also remarks that the first order are attracted
to the Deity by love, and hardly attributes place to them,
but states of desire and love, while the heaven which con-
tains the whole host is above the primum mobile, which,
again is superior to the starry firmament. This description,
and all others resembling it, the twelve heavenly worlds
of Plato, and the heaven succeeding it, the heaven of the
Chinese, for example, are but as landmarks serving to
denote the heights which the restless waves of human in-
telligence have reached at various times in the attempt
to represent the eternal and infinite in predse terms.
Boeheme recognises the " whole deep between the stars,"
as the heaven of one of the three hierarchies, and places
t he other two above it ; " in the midstofall which," he says,
" is the Son of God ; no part of either is farther or r:carer
to him, yet are the three kingdoms circular about him."
The Revelations of Swedenborg date a century later, and
begin all these subjects de nov·o, but his works are accessible
to all, and therefore we do not further allu'de to them.
Angels
The Jewish rabbi's hold the doctrine of another luer-
archy superior to these three, and some of them, as Bechai
and Joshua, teach that " every day ministering angels are
created out of the river Dinor, or fiery stream, and they
sing an anthem and cease to exist ; as it is written, they
are new every morning." This, however, is only a mis-
understanding, for to be " renewed " or " created " in the
scriptural sense, is to be regenerated ; and to be renewed
every morning is to be kept in a regenerate state ; the
fiery stream is the baptism by tire or divine love.
The following represent the angelic hierarchies answering
to the ten divine names :-
I. Jehovah, attributed to God the Father, being the
pure and simple essence of the divinity, flowing through
Hajoth Hakados to the angel !11etratton and to the minister-
ing spirit, Reschith H ajalafim, who guides the primum
mobile, and bestows the gift of being on all. These names
are to be understood as pure essences, or as spheres of
an,gels and blessed spirits, by whose agency the divine
providence extends to all his words.
'2. Jah, attributed to the person of the Messiah or Logos,
whose power and influence descends through the angel
Ma.sleh into the sphere of the Zodiac. This is the spirit
or word that actuated the chaos. and ultimately produced
the four elements, and all creatures that inherit them, by
the agency of a spirit named Raziel, who was the ruler of
Adam.
3· Ehjeh, attributed to the Holy Spirit, whose divine
light is received by the a11gcl Sabbathi, and communicated
from him through the sphere of Saturn. It d~notes the
beginning of the supernatural generation, and hence of
all living souls.
The ancient Jews considered the three superior names
which are those above, to be attributed to the divine
essence as personal or proper names, while the seven fol!ow-
ing denote the measures (middoth) or attributes which are
visible in the works of God. But the modern Jews, in
opposition to the tripersooalists, consider the whole as
attributes. Maurice makes the higher three denote the
heavens, and the succeeding the seven planets or worlds,
to each of which a presiding angel .was assigned.
4· El, strength, power, light, through which flow grace,
goodness, mercy, piety, and munificence to the angel
Zadkiel, and passing through the sphere of Jupiter fashion-
eth the images of all bodies, bestowing clemency, benevo-
lence and justice on all.
5· Elohi, the upholder of the sword and left hand of
God. Its influence penetrates the ange! Geburah (or
Gamaliel) and descends through the sphere of Mars. It
imparts fortitude in ,times of w:u and affliction.
6. Tsebaoth, the title of God as Lord of hosts. The
angel is Raphael, through. whom its mighty power passes
into the sphere of the sun, giving motion, heat and bright-
ness to it.
7· Elion, the tit!e of God as the highest. The angel is
Michael. The sphere to which he impnrts its influence is
Mercury, giving benignity, motion, and intelligence, witll
elegance and consonance of speech.
8. Adonai, master or lord, governing the angel Haniel,
and the sph~re of Venus.
9- Shaddai, the virlue of tlus name is conveyed by
Cherubim to the angel Gabriel, and influences the sphere
of the moon. It causes increase and decrease, and rules
the jinn and protecting spirits.
ro. Elohim, the source of knowledge, understanding
and wisdom, received by the angel Jc,sodoth, and imparted
to the sphere of the earth.
The division of a11gels into nine orders or three hier-
archies, as derived from Dionysius Areopagus, was held in
the Middle Ages, and gave the prevalent character to
Angels 26 Anonymous
much of their symbolism. With it was held the doctrine
of their separate creation. and the tradition of the rebel-
lious hierarchy, headed by Lucifer, the whole of which was
rendered familiar to the popular mind by the Epic of Milton.
Another lea-ling tradition, not so much interwoven with the
popular theology, was that of their intercourse with women,
producing the race of. giants. It was supposed to be
authorised by Gen. vi. 2 in the adoption of which the
Christian fathers seem to have followed the opinion of
Philo-Jud;eus, and Josephus. A particular account of the
circumstances is given in the book of Enoch, already men-
tioned, which makes the angels, Uriel, Gabriel, and 1\Iichael,
the chief instruments in the subjugation of the adulterers
and their formidable off-spring. The classic 'rnters have
perpetuated similar traditions of the " hero" race, all of
them born either from the love of the gods for women, or
of the preference shown for a goddess by some mortal man.
The Persian, Jewish, and Mohammedan accounts· of
ant:els all evince a common origin, and they alike admit a
difference of sex. In the latter, the name of Azazil is given
to the hierarchy nearest the throne of God, to which the
Mohammedan Satan {Eblis or H,1ris) is supposed to have
belonged; also Azreal, the angel of death, and Asra1H
{probably the same as Israfil), the a~~gel of the resurrection.
The examiners, Moukir and Nakir, are subordinate angels
of terrible aspect, armed with whips of iron and fire, who
interrogate recently deceased souls ~ to their lives. The
parallel to this tradition in the Talmud is an account of
seven angels who beset the paths of death. The Koran
also assigns two angels to every man, one to record his good,
and the other his evil actions ; they are so merciful that if
an evil action has been done, it is not recorded till the man
has slept, and -if in that interval he repents, they place on
the record that God has pardoned him. The Siamese,
beside holding the difference of sex, imagine that angels
have offspring ; but their traditions concerning the govern-
ment of the world and the guardianship of man are similar
to those of other nations.
The Christian fathers, for the most part, believed that
angels possessed bodies of heavenly substance (Tertullian
calls it " angelified flesh"), and, if not, that they could
assume a corporeal presence at their pleasure. In fact, all
the actions recorded of them in Scripture, suppose human
members and attributes. It is not only so in the historic
portions, but in the prophetic, even in the Apocalypse, the
most replete with symbolic figures. (See Magie.)
Angllerl : A Sicilian younger brother of the seventeenth
century, who i3 known by a work of which he published
two volumes and promised twenty-four, and which was
entitled Magic Light, or, the origin, order, and government
of all things celestial, terrestial, and infernal, etc. Mongi-
tore mentions it in his Sicilian Library.
Anglo-Saxons : (See England.)
Angnrvadel : The sword, possessing magical properties,
which was inherited by Frithjof, the hero of an Icelandic
saga. It had a golden hilt, and shone like tile Northern
Lights. In times of peace certain characters on its blade
were dull and pale; but during a battle they became red,
like 1ire.
ADJma Mundi : The soul of the world ; a pure ethereal spirit
which was said by some ancient philosophers to be diffused
throughout all nature. Plato is considered by some to be
the originator of this idea; but it is of more ancient origin,
and prevailed in the systems of certain eastern philo-
sophers. By the Stoics it was believed to be the only
vital force 10 the universe; it has been entertained by
many philosophical sects in a variety of forms, and in more
modem times by Paracelsus and others. It is also in-
corporated in the philosophy of Schelling. Rich says:
"The anima mundi, or heaven of this world, in which the
stars are fixed, is understood to be a receptivity of the
empyrean or heaven in which God dwells, so that the forms
or seminal conceptions of the one correspond to the divine
ideas of the other."
Animal Magnetism : (See Hypnotism and Splrltuallsm.)
Animism : The doctrine of spiritual beings, or the concept
that a great part, if not the whole, of inanimate nature,
as well as of animate beings, are endowed with reason and
volition iderrtical with that of man. It is difficult to
distinguish this conception from that of personalisation,
but the difference exists. The savage hea.rs the wind
whistle past him, and thinks that in it he can distinguish
voices. He sees movement in streams, trees, and other
objects, which he believes to be inhabited by spirits. The
idea of a soul probably arose through dreams, apparitions,
or clairvoyance, hallucinations and shadows, and perhaps
through the return to life after P.eriods of unconsciousness.
Movement, therefore, argued life. The cult of fetishism
well instances the belief in animism, for it posits the en-
trance into an inanimate body of a separate spiritual entity
deliberately come to inhabit it. There is no necessity
in this place to go into the question whether or not animism
is at the basis of religious belief ; but it is distinctly at the
root of magical belief and practice."'

Anneberg : A demon of the mines, known principally in
Germany. On one occasion he killed with his breath
twelve miners who were working in a silver mine of which
he bad charge. He is a wicked and terrible demon, repre-
sented under the figure of a horse, with an immense neck
and frightful eyes.

Annlus de Vlterbo : A learned ecclesiastic, born at Viterbo
in 1432, who, either deceived himself, oradeceivet of others,
published a collection of manuscripts full of fables and
absurdities, falsely attributed to Berosus, Fabius Victor,
Cato, Manettio and others, and known under the name of
The Antiquities of Annius. He was also responsible for a
treatise on The Empire of the Turks, and a book on the
Future Triumphs of the Christiatrs over the Turks a":l the
Sarace1:s, etc. These two works are explanations of the
Apocalypse. The author claims that Mahomet is the
Antichrist, and that the end of the world will take place
when the Christians will have overcome the Jews and the
Mohammedan~. which event did not appear to him to be
far distant.
Annwyl : The Celtic Other-world. ($ee Hell.)
Anonymous Adept (0. 1750) : A noted German jesuit of the
eighteenth century, known to his clerical confreres and his
flock as Athanas1us the Churchman. He composed two
folio volumes of semi-alcbemistic writing, which were
published at Amsterdam in '768. In the course of
these voluminous works, he alludes to an alchemist
whose name he refrains from revealing, and who is
usually hailed in .:on~equence by the elusive title
beading this article. Athanasius, we find, having long en-
deavoured to disco"er the Philosopher's Stone, and having
met with no success, chanced one day to encounter a
venerable personage, who addressed him thus : " I see by
these glasses and this furnace that you are engaged in
search after something very great in chemistry, but, believe
me, you will never attain your object by working as you
are doing." Pondering on these words, the shrewd Jesuit
suspected that his interlocutor was truly learned in
alchemy, wherefore he besought him to display hiserudition,
and thereupon our Anonymous A dept took a q uiU. and wrote
down a receipt for the making of transmutatory powder,
together with specific directions for using the same. " Let
us proceed together," said the great unknown; nor were
the hopes of Athanasias frustrated, for in a little while a.

fragment of gold was duly made, the wise pedagogue dis-
appearing immediately afterwards. The Jesuit now
fancied himself on the verge of a dazzling fortune, and he
proceeded straightway to try and manufacture nuggets;
but, alas ! Try as he might, his attempts all proved futile.
Much enraged, he went to the inn where the Anonymous
Adept was staying, but it need scarcely be said, perhaps,
that the bird was flown. " VIe see by this true history."
remarks Athanasius, ~y way of pointing a moral, " fiow
the devil seeks to deceive men who are led by a lust of
riches" ; while he relates further, that having beE"n duj>ed
in this wise, he destroyed his scientific appliances, to
renounce alchemy for ever.
Anpiel : One of the angels charged by the rabbis with
the government of the birds, for every known species was
put und<'r the protection of one or more angels.
Anselm de Parma : An astrologer, born at Parma, where he
died in I.f10. He wrote Astrological lf!-Stitutions. a
work which has never been printed. Wierius, and some
other demonologist~. classed hun with the sorcerers, because
certain charlatans, who healed sores by means of mystt>rious
words, had taken the name of" An~elmites." But Naude
observes that they bo;tSted that they had obtained their
gift of healing, not from Anselm of Parma, but from St.
Anselm of Canterbury, just as the Salutadores in Spain
recognised in Catherine, their patron saint, and those who
healed snake-bites in Italy, St. Paul.
Ansltlf : A little known demon, who, during the possession of
the nuns of LouviE'rs, in 1643, occupied the body of Sister
Barbara of St. Mich~el.
Answerer, or Fragarach : A magical sword belonging to the
Irish Sea-God, Lir. It was brought from tht> Celtic Other·
world by Lugh, the Irish Sun-God, and it wa.'l believed that
it cou!d pierce any armour.
Anthony St. : A great demon of enormous stature one day ap-
proached St. Anthony to offer his services. By way of
response the saint looked at him sideways and spat in his
face. The demon took the repulse so much to heart that
he vanished without a word, and did not dare to appear on
earth for a long time afterwards. It is hardlr conceivable
that St. Anthony could have treated the devil so rudely, if
one did not know how many temptations he had suffered
from him, thongh it is diffic~:lt to admit that he was the
object of so many attacks on the part of the devil, when he
himself said : " I fear the demon no more than I fear a
Hy, and with the ~ign of tht' cross l can at once put him to
flight." St. Athanasius, who wrote the life of St. Antho-ny,
mingled \~ith hi~ hero's adventures with the devil, certain
incidents which contrast strangely enough with these.
Some philosophers, nstonished at the great wisdom of
Antlumy, asked him in whnt book he had discovered so fine
a doctrine. Th<' saint pointed with one hand to the earth,
with the other t? the sky. " There are my books," said be,
" I have no others. If men will design to study as I do
the marvel~ of creation, they will find wisdom enough there.
Tl:eir spirit will soon soar from the creation to the Creator."
And certainly these were not the words of a man wbo
trafficked with the devil.
Antbropomaocy : Divination by the entrails of men or
women. This horrible usage is very ancient. Herodotus
said that Menelaus, detained in Egypt by contrary winds,
sacrificed to his barbarous curiosity, two children of the
country, and sought to discover his destiny by means of
anthropomaacy. Heliogabalus practised this means of divi-
nation. Julian the Apostate, in his magical operations.
during his nocturnal sacrifices, caused, it is sa.id, a large
number of children to be killed, so that he might consult
their entrails. In his last expedition, being at Carra, in
Mesopotamia, he shut himself in the Temple of the 1\foon,
and having done all manner of evil there, he sealed the
doors and posted a guard, whose duty it was to see
that they were not opened until his return. However, he
was killed in battle with the Persians, and those who
entered the Temple of Carra, in the reign of Julian's
successor, found there :l woman hanging by her hair, with
her liver torn out. It is probable that Gillesde Retz (q.v.)
also practised tltis dreadful species of divination.
Antichrist : The universal enemy of mankind, who "''ill in the
latter days be sent to scourge the world for its wickedness.
According to the Abbot Bergier, Antichrist is regarded as a
tyrant, impious and excessively cruel, the arch enemy of
Christ, and the last ruler of the earth. The persecutions
he will inflict on the elect will be the last and most severe
ordeal which they will have to undergo. Christ, himself,
according to several commentators, foretold that they
would have succumbed to it if its duration had not been
shortened on their behalf. lie will pose as the ~'lessiah,
and will perform things wonderful enough to mislead the
elect themselves. The thunder will obey him, according
to St. John, and Lcloyer asserts that the demons below
watch over hidden treasures by means of which he v.ill
be able to tempt many. It is on account of the miracles
that he will perform, that Boguet calls him the " Ape of
God," and it is through this scourge that God will pro-
claim the final judgment and the vengeance to be meted
out to wrong·doers.
Antichrist will have a great number of forerunners, and
will appear just before the end of the world. St. Jerome
claims that he will be a man begotten by a demon ; others,
a demon in the flesh, visible and fantastical. or an incarnate
demon. But, following St. lreneus, St. Ambrose, St.
Augustine, and almost all the fathers, Antichrist will be a
man similar to, and conceived in the same way as all others,
differing from them only in a malice and an impiety more
worthy of a demon than of a man. Cardinal Bellarmin,
at a later date, and contrary to their authority, asserts
however. that Antichrist will be the son of a demon incubus
and a sorceress.
He will be a J ew of the tribe of Dan, according to Mal-
venda, who supports his view by the words of the dying
Jacob to his son': " Dan shall be a serpent by the way-
an adder in the path; "-by those of Jeremiah:-" The
armies of Dan will devour the earth " ; and by the seventh
chapter of the Apocalypse, where St. J ohn has omitted
the tribe of Dan in his enumeration of the other tribes.
Antichrist will be always at war, and will astonish the
earth with his miracles. He will persecute the upright,
and ";n mark his own by a sign on the face or the hand.
Elijah and Enoch will come at length and convert the
Jews and will meet death at last by order of Antichrist,
Then will Christ descend from the heavens, kill Antichrist
with the two-edged sword, which will issue from His mouth.
and reign on the earth for a thousand years, according to
some ; an indefinite time, acr.ording to others.
It is claimed by some that the reign of Antichrist will
last fifty years : the opinion of the majority is that his
reign will last but three and a-hall years, after which the
angels will sound the trumpets of the day of judgment. and
Christ will come and judge the world. The watchword of
Antichrist, says Boguet, will be: " I abjure baptism."
Many commentators have foreseen the return of Elijah
in these words of Malachi : " I will send Elijah, the prophet,
before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the
Lord." But it is not certain that Malachi referred to this
ancient prophet, since Christ applied this prediction to
John the Bat>tiSt, when he said: "Elias is come already,
and they knew him not; " and when the angel foretold to
Zacharias the birth of his son, he said to him : " And he
shall go forth before the Lord in the spirit and power of
Elias."
Antichrist 28 Apollonias
By Antichrist may probably be meant the persecutors
of the Church. Again, the Protestants give the name to the
Pope and the Catholics to all their enemies. Kapoleon
even bas been called Antich,-ist.
The third treatise in the Histoire Veritable et Memorable
des Trois Possedees de Flandre, by Father Sebastien !\fich-
alies, dominican friar, throws much light in the words of
exorcised demons, on AnticMist. "Conceived through
the medium of a devil, he will be as malicious as a madman,
·with such wickedness as was never seen on earth. An
inhuman martyr rather than a human one, he will treat
Christians as souls arc treated in hell. He will have a
multitude of synagogue names, and he will be able to fly
when he wishes. Beelzebub will be his father, Lucifer
his grandfather." ..,
The revelations of exorcised demons show that Anti-
christ was alive in 1613. It appears that he has not yet
attained his growth " He was baptised on the Sabbath
of the sorcerers, before his inother, a Jewess, called La
Belle-Fleur. He was three years old in 1613. Louis
Gaufridi is said to have baptised him, in a field near Paris.
An exorcised sorceress claimed to have held the little A1tti-
christ on her knees. She said that his bearing was proud.
and that even then he spoke many divers languages But
he had talons in the place of feet, and he wore no slippers.
He will d.:> much harm, but there will be comforters, for
the Holy Ghost still lives." (Sec Merlin.) His father is
shown in the figure of a bird, with four feet, a tail, a bull's
head much flattened, horns and l>lack <;baggy h<1.ir. He
will mark his own "ith a seal representing- this in miniature.
Michaelis adds that things execrable will be around him.
He will destroy nome on account of the Pope, and the Jews
will help him. He will resuscitate the dead, and, when
thirty, will reign with Lucifer, the scven-headt'd dragon,
and, after a reign of three years, Christ will slay him.
J\lany such details might be quoted of A11tichrist, whose
appearance has ion~ been threatened, but with as yet no
fuHilment. (See End of the World.) \\"e must mention,
however, a volume published many years ago at Lyons,
by Rusand, called, Les Precurseurs de l' Antechrist. This
work shows that the reign of A11tichrist, if it has not begun,
is drawing near; that the philosophers. encyclopedists
and revolutionaries of the tighteenth century were naught
but demons incarnated to precede and prepare tbe way for
A nlirhrist. In our own time it has frequently been a\·erred
that A11tichrist is none other than the ex-Kaiser of Germany.
Antipathy : The old astrologers, who wished to explain
everything, claimed that the dislike which one feels for a
person or thing is caused by the stars. Thus. two persons
born under the same aspect, will be mutually attracted
one to the other, and will love without knowing why.
Others, again, born under opposite conjunctions, will feel
an unreasoning hate for each other. But how can that
antipathy be explained which great men sometimes have
for the commonest things ? There have been many such
cases, and all are inexplicable. Lamothe-Levayer could
not bear to hear the sound of any instrument, and dis-
played the liveliest pleasure at thenoiseof thunder. Cresar
could not hear the crowing of a cock \0.thout shuddering ;
Lord Bacon fell into despondency during the eclipse of the
moon ; Marie de Medicis could not bear to look on a rose,
even in a painting, though she loved all other flowers.
Cardinal Henry of Cardonne had the same a11tipathy, and
fell into a swoon when he felt the odour of roses; Marshal
d'Albret became ill at dinner when a young wild boar or a
sucking-pig was served ; Henry III. of France could not
remain in a chamber where there was a cat; Marshal de
Schomberg had the same weakness; Ladislas, King of
Poland. was much disturbed at the sight of apples; Scaliger
trembled in every limb at the sight o.f cress; Erasmus
could not taste fish without having the fever; Tycho-
Brahf- felt his knees give way when he met a hare or a fox;
the Duke of Epcrnon fainted at the sight of a leveret;
Cardan could not suffer eggs; Ariosto, baths; the son of
Cro::sus, bread ; Cresar of Lescalle, the sound of the vielle
or violin.
Thoe causes of these antipathits are sometimes to be found
in childish impressions. A lady who was very fond of
pictures and engravings, fainted away when she found them
in a book. She explained her terror thus : When she was a
child her father had one day seen her turning over the
leaves of the books in his library, in search of pictures.
He had roughly taken the book from her hand, telling her
in terrible tones that there were devils in these books, who
would strangle her i£ she dared to touch them. These
absurd threats occasionally have baneful effects that can-
not be overcome. Pliny, who was fairly credulous, assures
us that there is such an antipathy between the wolf and the
horse, that if a horse pass by the way a wolf has gone, be
feels his legs become so numbed that he cannot walk.
But the instinct of animals does not err. A horse in
America could <htcct the presence of a puma, and obsti-
nately refused t , go through a forest where his keen sense
of smell announced to him that the enemy was at hand.
Dogs also can tell when a wolf is near. Perhaps, on the
wholP., human beings would be wiser if they followed the
dictates of these sympathetic or antipathetic impressions.
Antiphates : A shining black stone, used as a defence against
witchcraft.
Antraeltes, or Antracbas, or Anthrax : A stone, sparkling like
fire, supposed by .'\lbcrtus Magnus to be the carbuncle. It
cures "imposthumcs." It is girdled with a white vein.
If smeared with oil it loses its colour, but sparkles the more
for being dipped in water.
Anupadaka Plane : (See Monadic World.)
Aonbarr : A horse belonging to J\lanaaoan, son of the Irish
Sea-God, Lir. It was believed to p~sess magical gifts,
and could gallop on land or sea.
Apantomaney : Divination by means of any objects which
happen to present themselves. To this class belong the
omens drawn from chance meetings with a hare an eagle,etc.
Apepl, Book or Overthrowing or : An Egyptian work which
forml a considerable portion of the funerary papyrus of
Nesi-Amsu. It deals with the diurnal combat between
Ra, the Sun-God, and Apepi, the great serpent, the im-
personation of spiritual evil, and several of the chapters,
notably 31, 33. and 35 to 39 are obviously borrowed from
the Book of the Dead (q.v.). It contains fifteen chapters,
in which there is a great deal of repetition, and details the
various methods for the destruction of Apepi, including
many magical directions. It is set forth that the name of
A pepi must be written in green on a papyrus and then
burnt. V\ax ligures of his attendant fiends were to be
made, mutilated, and burnt, in the hope that through the
agency of sympathetic magic their prototypes might be
injured or destroyed. Another portion of the work details
the creative process and describes how men and women
were formed from the tears of the god Khepera. This
portion is known as The Book of K11owing the Evolutions
of Ra. The work is evidently of high antiquity, as i~.
shown by the circumstance that many variant readings
occur. Only one copy. however, is known. The· funeral
papyrus in which it LS contained was discovered at Thebes
in t86o, was purchased by Rb.ind, and sold to the trustees
of the British l\luscum by Mr. David Bremner. The linen
on which it is written lS of very fine texture, measures
19 feet by 9! inches, and it bas been translated by Mr.
\\'allis Budge in Archaeologia, Vol. 52, Part II.
Apollonius or Tyana : A Nco-Pythagorean philosopher of
Greece, who had a great reputation for magical powers.
· Apollonius 29 Apparitions
Born at Tyana. in Asia '.Iinor. ApJllcmius was contemporary
with Christ. He was educated at Tarsu3 and at the Temple
ol tEsculapius, at tEgae, where he became an adherent of
the sect of Pvthagoras. to whose strict discipline he sub-
mittc:l himself throul{hout his life. In his desire for know-
ledge he travelled widely in Eastern countries. and is s-:1id
to have performed miracles wherever he went. At Ephesus,
for instance, he warned the people of the approach of a
terrible plague, but t'tey gave no heed to him until the
pe<itilence wa~ actualiy in their miJst, when they bethought
them oi the warnin~. and summoned the potent magi~an
who had uttered it. Apollonius pointed out to the people
a poor, maimed beg!lar, who:n he denounced as th'e cause
of the pestilence and an enemy of the l!ods, bidding them
stone the unfortunate wretch to death. The citizens were
at first reluctant to comply with so cruel an injunction,
but something in the expression of the beggar confirmed
the prophet's accusation, and the wretch was soon covered
with a mound of stones. When the stones were r,emovcd
no man was visible. but a huge black dog, the cause of the
plague, which had come upon the Ephesians. At Rome he
raised from death- or apparent death-his biographerdoes
not seem to know which-a young lady of consular family,
who had been betrothed, and was lamented by the
entire city. Yet another story relates how Apollonius
saved a friend of his, Mcnippus of Corinth, from marrying
a vampire. The youth n\!g!ected a!l the earlier warnings
of his cou:lscllor. and the preparations for the wedding
proceeded til! finally all was in readiness for the ceremony.
At this juncture .d pollm1ius appeared on the scene, caused
the wedding feast, the guests, and all the evidences of
wealth, which were but illusion to vanish, and }VTUng from
the bride the confession that she was a vampire. :Many
other simiL'lr tales are told of the philosopher's clairvoyant
and magical powers.
The manner of his death is wrapped in mystery. though
he is known to have lived to be nearly a hundred years of
age. His disciple~ did not hesitate to say that he had
not died at all, but had been caught up to heaven, and his
biographer casts a doubt upon the matter. At all events,
when he had vanished from the terrestial sphere, the in-
habitants of his native Tyana built a temple in his honour,
and statues were raised to him in various other tem-
ples.
A life of Apollonitts, written by Philostratus at the
instance of Julia, mother of the Emperor Severus, is the
only extant source of information concernin~ the sage,
though other lives, now lost. are known to have ex"isted.
The account given by Philostratus purports to have been
compiled fn:..m the memoirs of " Damis the Assyrian," a
disciple of Apollonius, but it has been suggested that
Damis is but a literary fiction. The work is largely a
romance; ftctitious stories are often introduced, and the
whole account is mystical and symbolical. Nevertheless
it is possible to gel: a glimpse of the real character of Apol-
lMius beyond the literary artifices of the writer. The
purpose of the philosopher of Tyana seems to have been to
infuse into paganism a morality more practical combined
with a more transcendental doctrine. He himself practised
a very severe asceticism, and supplemented his own know-
ledge by revelations from the gods. Because of his claim
to divine enlightenment, some would have refused him a
place among the philosophers, but Phtlostratus holds that
this in no wise detracts from his philosophic reputation.
Pythagoras and Plato and Democritus he points out, were
wont to visit Eastern sages, even as Apollo,tius had done,
and they were not charged with dabbling in magic. Divine
revelations had been given to earlier philosophers; why
not also to the Philosopher of Tyana? It is probable
that Apollonius borrowed considerably from Oriental
s:>urce;;, anJ that his dqctrines were more Brahminical
than magical.
Apparel, Phantom : (See Phantom Dress.)
Apparitions : An apparition (from Latin apparer~. to appear}
is in its l!teral !\Cnse merely an appearance, that is, a sense-
percept of any kind, but in every-day usage the word has a
more restricted meaning and is used only to denote an
abnormal or superabnorma! appearance or perct-pt, which
cannot be referred to any natural objective cause. Taken
in this sense the word covers al! visionary appearances,
hal!ucinations, clairvoyance,and similar unusual perceptions.
"Apparitio:. "and' ghost" are frequently used as synony-
mous terms, though the former is, of cour~. of much wider
significance. A ghost is a visual apparition of a deceased
human being. and the term implies that it is the spirit of
the person it represents Apparitions of animals and of
inanimate objects are also sufficiently frequent. AJI
apparitio~Js do not take the form of visual images ; anditory
and ta('tile false perceptions. though less common, are
not unknown, and there is record of a house that was
" haunted " with the perpetual odour of violets.
Evolution ojlheBelief inApparitions.-Th:.)rc is nodouht
that the belief which identifies an apparition witll tile spirit
of the creature it represents- a belief widely current in all
nations and all times--is directly traceable to the ancient
doctrine of animism, which endowed everything in nature,
from man himself to the smallest insect, from the heavenly
bodies to an insignificant plant or stone, with a separable
soul. It is not difficult to understand how the conception
of souls may have arisen. Sir J.Frazer, in his Golden Bough,
says: •· As the savage commonly explains the processes of
inanimate nature by supposing that they are produced by
Jiving beings working in or behind the phenomena, so he
explains the phenomen1 of life itself. If an anima! lives
and moves, it can only be, he thinks, because there is a
little animal inside which moves it. If a man Jives and
moves. it can only be because he has a little man or animal
inside, who moves him. The animal inside the animal, the
man inside the man, is the soul. And as the activity of an
animal or man is explained by the presence of the soul,
so the repose of sleep or death is explained by its absence;
sleep or trance being the temporary, death being the per-
manent absence of the soul" Sometime~ the human soul
was represented as a bird--an P.agle, a dove, a raven-<>r
as an animal of some sort, just as the soul of a river might
be in the form of a horse or a serpent, or the soul of a tree
in human shape ; but among most peoples the belief was
that the soul was an exact reproduction of the body
resembling it in every feature, even to details of dress, etc.
Thus. when a man saw another in dream, it was thought
either that the soul of the dreamer had visited the perSQn
dreamed of, or that .the so1,1l of the latter had visited the
dreamer. By an easy process of reasoning, the theory was
extended to include dreams of animals and inanimate
things, which also were endowed with souls. And thus
it is quite probable that the hallucinations with which
primitive peoples as well as those at a later stage of culture
were at times visited, and which they doubtless knew
well how to induce, should be regarded as the souls of the
things they represent. If it be granted that telepathy
and clairvoyance operate sometimes at the present day,
and among civilised peoples, it may be conceded on still
more abundant testimony that they were known to primitive
races. And it is obvious that these faculties would have
a powerful effect in the development of a belief in appari-
tions. The apparitio11 of a deceased person, again, would
inevitably suggest the continuance of the soul's existence
beyond the grave, and the apparitiott of a sick person, or
one in some other grave crisis-such as might now-a-days
be accounted for telepathically-would also be regarded
Apparitions 30
as the soul, which at such times was absent from the body.
There is a widely diffused opinion that ghosts are of a
filmy, unsubstantial nature, and this also would seem to
have taken its rise in the first animistic concepts of primitive
man. At a very early sta~e of culture we find spirit and
breath confused-they are Identified in the Latin spiYitus
and the Greek fmeuma. as well as in other language.s.
How natural it is. therefore, that the breath, condensed in
the cold air to a white mist, should be regarded as the stuff
that ghosts are made of. On another hypothesis, the
shadowy nature of the ghost may have resulted from an
early confusion of the soul with the shadow. Thus ani-
mistic ideas of the soul have given rise to the belief in
appariticms. But animism has a further contribution to
make towards this belief in the host of spirits which have
not, and never have had. bodieo;, true supernatural beings,
as distinct from souls- gods, elementary spirits, and those
evil spirits to which were :lttributed disease, disaster,
possession, and bewitchment. This class of beings has
evolved into the fairies, elves, brownies, bogies, and goblins
of popular folklore, or which many apparitiom are recorded.
Savage Imtances of Appariliom;. ln classic and media!val
times the concept of the ghost was practically identical
with that of savage peoples. It is only within the last
two generations that scientific investigation was deemed
necessary, as the result of the birth of a scepticism hitherto
confined to the few, and in the general mind weak or
.non-existent. (For ddails of ~ucb research see Spiritual-
Is~ and Psychical Research.) One of the most noteworthy
features of ghosts in savage lands is the fear and antagonism
with which they are regarded. Almost invariably the
spirits of the deceased are thought to be unfriendly towards
the living, desirous of drawing the souls of the latter, or
their shadows, into the spirit-world. Sometimes. as with
the Australian abori~ines, they are represented as malign-
ant demons. Naturally, everything possible is done to
keep the ghost at a distance from the habitation of the
living. With some peoples thorn bushes arc planted round
the beds of the surviving relatives. Persons returning
from a funeral pass through a cleft tree, or other narrow
aperture, to free themselves from the ghost of him whom
they have buried. Others plunge into water to achieve
the same purpose. The custom of closing the eyes of the
dead is said to have arisen from the fear that the ghost
would find its way back again, and the same reason is given
for the practice, common among Hottentots, Hindus,
North American Indians, and many other peoples, of
carrying the dead out through a hole in the wall, the
aperture being immediately afterwards closed. The
Mayas of Yucatan, however, draw a line with chalk from
the tomb to the hearth, so that the soul may return if it
desires to do so. Among uncultured races, the names of
the departed, in some mysterious manner bound up '"ith
the soul, if not identified with it, are not mentioned by the
survivors, and any among them possessing the same name,
changes it for another. The shape in which apparitions
appear among savages may be the human form, or the
form of a beast, bird, or fish. Animal ghosts are common
among the Indians of North and South America. Certain
African tribes believe that the souls of evil-doers become
jackals on the death of the body. The Tapuya Indians of
Brazil think that the souls of the good enter into birds, and
this belief is of rather wide diffusion. Wben the appartt1on
is in human shape it is generally an exact counterpart
o' the person it represents, and, like the apparitions of more
civilised countries, its dress is that worn by the deceased
in his lifetime. This last feature, of course, implies the
doctrine of object-souls, which bas its roots in animism.
Though it is generally accepted by savage peoples that the
shades of the departed mingle with the living, coming and
Apparitions
going with no particular object in view, yet the revtnant
may on occasion have a special purpose in visiting the
scene of his earthly life. It may be that the spirit desires
that its body be buried with the proper ceremonial rites,
if these have been omitted. In savage, as in civilised
countries, it is ht>licved that the spirits of those who have
not been buried at all, cannot have any rest till the rite
has been duly performed. rn China, the commonest ghost
is that of a person who has been murdered. and who seeks
to be avenged on his murderer. The spirit of one who has
been murdered, or has died a violent death, is considered in
Australia also to be espe<"ially likely to walk abroad, while
in many barbarous or scmi-b:\rbaro1:s lands the souls of
women who have died in childbirth, are supposed to become
spirits of a particularly malignant type, dwelling in trees,
tormenting and molesting passers-by. There is another
reason for which apparitio11s sometimes appear: to reveal
the site of hidden treasure. The guardians of buried
boards arc, however, supernatural beings rather than human
souls, and the shapes they take are often grotesque or
terrible. It is customary for ghosts to haunt certain
localities. The favourite spot seems to be the burial·place,
of which there is an almost universal superstitious dread ;
but the Indians of Guiana go a step farther in maintaining
that every place where anyone has died is haunted. Among
the Kaffirs and the Maoris of New Zealand a hut wherein
a death has occurred is taboo. and is often burnt or deserted.
Sometimes, even a whole village is abandoned on account
of a death-a practice, this, which must be attended with
some inconvenience. There is one point on whicl;l the
apparitions of primitive peoples differ from those of more
advanced races-the former seldom attain to the dignity
of articulate human speech. They chirp like crickets, for
instance, among the Algonquin Indians, and their" voices"
arc only intelligible to the trained ear of the shaman. The
ghosts of the Zulus and New Zealanders, a11ain, speak to
the magicians in thin, whistling tones. Thts idea of the
semi-articulate nature of ghosts is not confined to savage
concepts ; Shakespeare speaks of •· the sheeted dead,"
who, ·• did squeak and gibber in the streets of Rome," and
the " gibbering " ghost appears in other connections.
Naturally the articulate apparition is doubly convincing,
since it appeals to two separate senses. Dr. Tylor says:
" Men who perceive evidently that souls do talk when they
present themselves in dream or vision, naturally take for
granted at once the objective reality of the ghostly voice,
and of the ghostly form from which it proceeds." Spirits
which are generally invisible may appear to certain persons
and under certain circumstances. Thus in the Antilles,
it is believed that one person travelling alone may see a
ghost which would be invisible to a number of people.
The shamans, or medicine-men, and magicians are able
to perceive appar-iliom which none but they can see. The
induction of hallucinations by means of fasts, rigid ascetic-
ism, solitude, the use of narcotics and intoxicants, dances,
and the performing of elaborate ceremonial rites, is known
all over the world, and among uncultured as well as cul-
tured peoples. Coincidental apparitiOilS, it may be re-
marked en passalll, arc comparatively rare in savage
countries. Naturally, a great many savage instances of
apparitions arc concerned with supernatural beings other
than human souls. but such cases are dealt with elsewhere.
A11cie11t a11d Modem Ideas Concerning Apparitions. The
belief in apparitiolls was very vivid among ancient Oriental
peoples. The early Hebrews atrtibuted them to angels,
demons, or the souls of the dead, as is shown in the numerous
Scriptural instances of aPPariliolts. Dreams were re-
garded as appaYitions if the predictions made in them were
fulfilled, or if the dream-figure revealed anything unkno'vn
to the dreamer which afterwards proved to be true. That
Apparitions 31
the Hebrews believed in the possibility of the souls of the
dead returning, is evident from the tale of the Witch of
Endor. Calmet says, in this connection : " Whether
Samuel was raised up or not, whether his soul, or only a
shadow, or even nothing at all a-ppeared to the womll.n,
it is still certain that Saul and his attendants, with the
generality of the Hebrews, believed the thing to be pos-
sible." Similar beliefs were held by other Eastern nations.
Among the Greeks and Romans of the classic period,
apparitions of gods and men would seem to have been fairly
common. Calmet, in his Disstrtation on Appariti011$, o;ays:
" The ancient Greeks, who had derived their re!J.gion and
theology from the Egyptians and Eastern nations, and the
Latins, who had borrowed theirs from the Greeks, were all
firmly persuaded that the souls of the dead appeared some-
times to the living-that they could be called up by necro-
mancers, that they answered questions, and gave notice
of future events; that Apollo gave oracles, and t.':!.at the
priestess. filled with his spirit, and transported with a holy
enthusiasm, uttered infallible predictions of things to come.
Homer, the most ancient of all the Greek writers, and their
greatest divine, relates several apparitiotlS, not only of
gods, but of dead men and heroes. In the Odyssey, he
introduces Ulysses consulting Teresias, who, having pre-
pared a pit full of blood, in order to call up the Manes,
Ulysses draws his sword to hinder them from drinking the
blood for which they were very thirsty. till they had ans-
wered the questions proposed to them. It was also a
prevailing opinion, that the souls of men enjoyed no repose,
but wandered about near their carcases as long as they
continued unburied. Even after they were buried, it was
a custom to offer them something to eat, especially honey,
upon the supposition that after having left their graves,
they came to feed upon what was brought them. They
believed also, that the demons were fond of the smoke of
sacrifices, of music, of the blood of "'i.ctims, and the com-
merce of women ; and that they were confined for a deter-
minate time to certain houses or other places, which they
haunted, and in which they appeared.
" They held that souls, when separated from their gross
and terrestial bodies, still retained a finer and more subtile
body, of the same form with that which they had quitted ;
that these bodies were luminous like the stars ; that they
retained an inclination for the things which they had loved
in their life-time, and frequently appeared about their
graves. When the soul of Patroclus appeared to Achilles,
it had his voice, his shape, his eyes, and his dress, but not
the same tangible body. Ulysses relates, that when he
went down into hell, he saw the divine Here11/es, that is,
adds he, his image : for he himself is admitted to the ban-
qttets of the immortal gods. Dido says, that after death
she, that is, her image bigger than the life, shall go down
to the infernal regions.
" 'Et mine mag11a mei s11b terras ibit imago.'
" And JEncas knew his wife Crcusa, who appeared to
him in her usual shape. but of a taller and nobler stature
than when she was alive.
" Infelix simttlacYum, atque ipsius umbra Cre:~sa1,
Visa mihi ante orulos, et nota major imago.
" In the speech which Titus made to his soldiers, to
persuade them to mount to the assault of the Tower An-
tonia at Jerusalem, he uses this argument: • Who knows
not that the souls of those who bravely expose themselves
to danger, and die in war, are exalted to the stars, are
there received into the highest region of heaven, and ap-
pear as good genii to their relations ; while they who die
of sickness, though they have lived good lives, are plunged
into oblivion and darkness under earth, and are no more
remembered after death, than if they had never existed."
Again he says :
Apparitions
" We find that Origen, Tertullian, and St. Jrenaus, were
clearlr o! this opinion. Origen, in his second book against
Celsus, relates anrl subscribes to the opinion of Plato, who
says, that the shadows and images of the dead, which are
seen near sepulchre~. are nothing but the soul disengaged
from its gross body, but not yet entirely freed from matter;
that these souls become in time luminous. transparent,
and subtile, or rather are carried in luminous and trans-
parent bodies, as in a vehicle, in wh;ch they appeal to the
living. . . . Tertullian, in his book concerning the soul,
asserts that it is corporeal, and of a certain figure, and
appeals to the experience ofthose who have seen apparitions
of departed souls. and to whom they have appeared as
corporeal and tangible, thO\lgh of an aerial colour and
consistence. He defines the soul to be a breath from God,
immortal, corporeal, and of a certain figure."
It is interesting to note that some of these classic spectres
are nearly akin to the melodramatic conceptions of more
modern times. The younger Pliny tells of haunted houses
whose main features correspond with those of later haunt-
ings--houses haunted by dismal, chained spectres, the
ghosts of murdered men who could not rest till their mortal
remains had been properly buried.
In the early centuries of the Christian era there was no
diminution in the number of a.ppa.Yitions ·witnessed. Visions
of saints were frequently seen. and were doubtless induced
by the fasts, rigid asceticism, and severe penances practiced
in the name of religion. The saints themselves saw visions,
and were attended by guardian angels, and harassed by
the unwelcome attentions of demons, or of their master,
the devil. These beliefs continued into the Middle Ages,
when, without undergoing any abatement in vigour, they
began to take on a more romantic aspect. The witch
and wer-wolf superstitions were responsible for many tales of
animal apparitions. The poltergeistflourished in a congenial
atmosphere. Vampires were terribly familiar in Slavonic
lands, and nowhere in Europe were they quite unknov.'O.
The malignant demons, known as incubi and succubi, were
no less common. In the northern countries familiar spirits
or goblins, approximating to the Roman lares, or the
wicked and more mischievous letnures, haunted the
domestic hearth, and bestowed well-meant, but not always
desirable, attentions on the families to which they attached
themselves. These beings were accountable for a vast
number of apparitions, but the spirits of the dead also
walked abroad in the Dark Ages. Generally they wished
to unburden their minds of some weighty secret which
hindered them from resting in their graves. The criminal
came to confess his guilt, the miser to reveal the spot where
he had hidden his gold. The cowled monk walked the dim
aisles of a monastery, or haunted the passages of some
Rhenish castle, till the prayers of the devout had won
release for his tortured soul. Perchance, a maiden in
white flitted through the corridor of some old mansion,
moaning and wringing her bands. enacting in pantomime
some long-forgotten tragedy. At the cross-road'> lingered
t he ghost of the poor suicide, uncertain which way to take.
The old belief in the dread potency of the unburied dead
continued to exercise sway. There is, for example, the
Getman story of the Bleeding Nun. Many and
ghastly had been her crimes during her lifetime, and
finally she was murdered by one of lter paramours,
her body being left unburied. The castle wherein she
was slain became the scene of her nocturnal wanderings.
It is related that a young woman who wished to elope
with her lover decided to disguise herself as this ghostly
spectre in order to facilitate their escape. But the un-
fortunate lover eloped with the veritable Bleeding ~un
herself, mistaking her for his mistress. This, and other
traditional apparitions, such as the ·wild Huntsman, the
Apparitloru; 32
Phantom Coach, the Flying Dutchman, which were not
confined to any one locality, either originated in this period
or acquired in it a \Vildly romantic character which lent
itself to treatment by ballad-writers, and it is in ballad
form that many of them have come down to us.
This hey-day of the apparition passed. however, at
length, and in the eighteenth century we find among the
cultured classes a scepticism as regards the objective
nature of appa,itiMJS, which was destined two centuries
later to become almost universal. Hallucination, though
not yet very well understood, began to be called the " power
of imagination." l\Iany appaYitio>I.S, too, were attri-
buted to illusion.. Nevertheless, the belief in apparitio1ss
was sustained and strengthened by the clairvoyant
powers of magnetic subjects and somnambules. Sweden-
borg, who had, and still has many disciples, did
much to encourage the idea that appa,itions were
objective and supernatural. To explain the fact that
only the seer saw these beings and heard .their voices,
he says:
" The speech of an angel or of a spirit with man is heard
as sonorously as the speech of one man with another : yet
it is not heard by others who stand near, but by the man
himself alone. The reason is, the speech of an angel or
of a spirit flows in first into the man's thought, and by an
internal way into the organ of hearing, an1 thus actuates
it from within, whereas the speech of m1.n dows fir~t into
the air, and by an external way into the organ of bearing
which it actuates from without. Hence, it is evident, that
the speech of an angel and of a spirit with man is heard in
man, and, since it equally affects the organ of hearing, that
it is equally sonorous."
Thus it will be seen that ancient an1 mo1ern ideas on
app~Yitions differ very little in essentb.l particulars; though
they take colour from the race and time to whlch they
belong. Now they are thin, gibbering shadows; now they
are solid, full-bodied creatures, hardly to be distinguished
from real flesh and blood ; again they are rich in romantic
accessories ; but the laws which govern their appearance
are· the sam~. and the beliefs concerning them are not
greatly different, in whatever race or age they may be
found.
p,esent-Day ThtoYies Concuni11g Apparitions.-At the
present time apparitions are generally, though by no means
universally, referred to hallucination (q.v.) Even those
who advance a spiritualistic theory of apparitions fre-
quently incline to this view, for it is argued th~t the dis-
carnate intelligence may, by psychical energy alone,
produce in the brain of a living person a definite hallu-
cination, corresponding perhaps to the agent's appearance
in life. Halluctnations may be either coincidental or non-
coincidental. The former, also known as telepathic hallu-
cinations, are those which coincide with a death, or with
some other crisis in the life of the person represented by
the, hallucination. The Society for Psychical Research
has been instrumental in collecting npmerous instances of
coincidental hallucinations, many of which are recorded
in Phantasms ofthe Livi11g, by Messrs. Myers, Podmore and
Gumey. Mr. Podmore was indeed the chief exponent of the
telepathic theory of ghosts (jor which see also Telepathy)
which he had adopted after many years of research and
experiment. He suggested that apparitioM result from a
telepathic. impression conveyed from the mind of one
living person to that of another, an impression which may
be doubly intense in time of stress or exalted emotion, or
at the moment of dissolution. Apparitio;u of the dead
be would account tor by a theory of latent impnssions,
conveyed to the mind of the percipient during the agent's
lifetime, but remaining dormant until some particular train
of thought rouses them to activity. This view is largely
Apparitions
supported at the present day. Hallucinations, whether
coincidental or otherwise, may, and do present themselves
to persons who are perfectly sane and normal, but they are
also a feature of insanity, hypnotism and hysteria, and of
certain pathological conditions of brain, nerves, and sense-
organs. The late Mr. Myers was of opinion that an appari-
tion represented an act.tal "psychic invasion," that it was
a projection of some of the agent's psychic force. Such
a doctrine is. as Mr. Myers himself ,;ldmitted, a reversion to
animism. There is another modern theory of appMititmS,
particularly applicable to haunted houses. This is the
theory of psychometry (q.v.). Sir Oliver Lodge, in his
Ma4 and the Universe, says:
." Occasionally a person appears able to respond to
stim.1li embededd, as it were among psycho·physical
surroundings in a manner at present ill understood and
almo3t incredible :-as if strong emotions could be un-
consciously recorded in matter, so that the deposit s~ll
thereafter affect a sufficiently sensitive organism, and
cause similar emotions to. reproduce themselves in its sub-
consciousness, in a manner analogous to the customary
conscious interpretation of photographic or phonographic
records. and indeed of pictures or music and artistic em-
bodiment generally."
Take, for example, a haunted house of the traditional
Christmas-number type, wherein some one room is the
scene of a ghostly representation of some long past tragedy.
On a psychometric hypothesis the original tragedy has
been literally photo:zraphed on its material surroundings,
nay, even on the ether itself, by reason of the intensity
of emotion felt by those who enacted it; and thenceforth
in certain persons an hallucinatoryeffect is experienced cor-
responding to such impression. It is this theory which is made
to account for the feeling one has on entering certain rooms,
that there is an alien presence therein, though it be in-
visible and inaudible to mortal sense. The doctrine of
psychometry in its connection with apparitio,ls is of con-
siderablP..interest becau~e of its wide possibilities, but it
belongs to the region of romance rather than to that of
science, and is hardly to ba considered as a serious theory
of appMitions at least. until it is supported by better
evidence than its protagonists can show at present.
Spiritualistic the.,ries o! appaYJiion.s also vary. though
they agree in referring such appearances to discarnate
intelligences, generally to the sptrits of the dead. The
opinion of some spiritualistic authorities is, as bas been
said, that the surviving spirit produces in the mind of the
percipient, by purely psychic means, an hal!ucination
repr<!senting his (the agent's) former bo:lily appearance.
Others believe th<tt the discarnate spirit can materialise by
taking to itself ethereal particles from the external world,
and t!l.us build \Jp a temporary physical organism through
which it can communicate with the living. Still others
con>ider th~t the materialised spiriL borrows such temporary
physical organism from that o£ the medium, and experi-
ments have been made to _prove that the medium loses
weight durin~ the. materialtsation. (See Materlallsatioo..)
The animistic belie( that the soul itself can become visible
is not now generally credited, since it is thought that pure
spirit cannot be perceptible to the physical senses. But
a compromise has been made in the' psychic body, · (q.v.),
midway between soul ·and body, which some spiritualists
consider clothes the soul at the dissolution of the physical
body. The psychic body is composed of material particles,
very fine and subtle, and perceptible as a rule, only to the
eye of the clairvoyant. It is this, and not the spirit,
which is seen as an appaYition. ·we must not overlook
the theory held by some Continental investigators, that
" spirit materialisations " so-called are manifestations of
psychic force emanating from the medium.
Apparitions 33 Aquinas
Different Classes of Apparitions.-Many of the various
classes of apparitiOtlS having been considered above, and
others being dealt with UJlder their separate headings, it is
hardly necess:uy to do more than enumerate them here.
Apparitions may be divided broadly into two classes-
induced and spontaneous. To the former class belong
hypnotic and post-hypnotic hallucinations (see Hypnotism)
and visions (q.v.) induced by the use of narcotics and
intoxicants, fasts, ascetic practices, incense, narcotic
salves, and auto-hypnotisabon. The hallucinatory ap-
pearances seen in the mcdiu!I\Jstic or somnambulistic trance
are, of course, allied to those of hypnotism, but usually
arise spontaneously, and are often associated with clair-
voyance (q.v.). Crystallomancy (q.v.) or crystal vision
is a form of apparition which is stated to be frequently
clairvoyant, and in this case the theory of telepathy is
especially applicable. Crystal visions fall under the
heading of induced apparitions, since gazing in a crystal
globe induces in some persons a species of hypnotism. a
more or less slight dissociation of consciousness, without
which hallucination is impossible. Another form of clair·
voyance is second sight (q.v.). a faculty common among
the Scottish Highlanders. Persons gifted with the second
sight often see symbolical apparitions, as, for instance, the
vision"if a funeral or a coffin when a death is about to occur
in the community. Symbolical appearances are indeed
a feature of clairvoyance and visions generally. Clair-
voyance includes retrocognition and premonition-visions
of the past and the future respectively-as we-!1 as appari-
tions of contemporary events happening at a distance.
Clairvoyant powers are often attributed to the dying.
Dreams are, strictly spealdng, apparitions, but in ordinary
usage the term is applied only to coincidental or veridical
dreams, or to those " visions of the night," which are of
peculiar vividness.
From these subjective apparitions let us turn to the
ghost proper. The belief in ghosts has come to us, as
has been indicated, from the remotest antiquity, and
innumerable theories ha,·e been formulated to account
for it, from the primitive animistic conception of the
apparitwn as an actual soul to the modern theories enumer-
ated above, of which the chief are telepathy and spirit
matcrialisation. Apparitio11s of the living also offer a wide
field for research, perhaps the most favoured hypothesis
at the present day being that of the telepathic hallucination,
A peculiarly wt:ird type of apparition is the wraith (q.v.)
or double, of which the Insh fetch is a variant. The
wraith is an exact facsimile of a living person. who may
himself sec it; Goethe, Shelley, and other famous men
are said to have seen their own wraiths. The fetch makes
its appe:trance shortly before the death of the person it
represents, either to himself or his friends, or both. An-
other Irish spirit which foretells death is the banshee (q.v.),
a being which attaches itself to certain ancient families,
and is regularly seen or heard before the death of one of its
members. To the same class belong the omens of death,
in the form of certain anim>\ls or birds, which follow some
families. Hauntings or localised apparitiolls are dealt
with under the heading " Haunted Houses." The pol-
tergeist (q.v.). whose playful manifestations must cer-
tainly be included among apparitions, suggests another
classification of these as visual, auditory, tactile, etc., since
poltergeist hauntings-or indeed hauntings of any kind-
are not confincJ to apparitions touching any one sense. For
apparitions of fairies, brownies, and others of the creatures
of folk-lore, see Fairies.
ln this article an attempt has been made to show as
briefly as possible the universality of the belief in appara-
tions, and the varied forms under which this belief ex-
hibits itself in various times and countries among savage
and civilised peoples; and to indicate the basic principles
on which it rests-namely, the existence of a spiritual
world capable of manifesting itself in the sphere of matter,
and the survival of the human soul after the dissolution
of the body. While the beliefs in this connection of savage
races and of Europeans in early and medi.eval times may
arouse interest and curiosity for their own sakes, the
scientific invc<>ti~ator of the present day values them
chiefly as throwmg light on modern beliefs. The belief
in apparitions is a root ~rinciple of spiritualism. Many
who are not spiritualists 10 the accepted sense have had
experiences which render the belief in apparitions almost
inevitable. A subject which touches so nearly a consider-
able percentage of the community, including many people
of culture and education, and concerning which there is a
vast quantity of evidence extending back into antiquity,
cannot be a matter of indifference to science, and the
investigations made by scientific men within recent years
arouse surprise that such investigation has been so
long delayed. The Society for Psychical Research has
gathered many well attested instances of coincidental
apparitions, clairvoyance, and apparitions of the dead.
As yet, however, the problem remains unsolved, and the
various hypotheses advanced are conflicting and sometimes
obscure. The theory of telepathic hallucination offered
by Mr. Podmore seems on the whole to be the most c.on-
formable to known natural laws, while at the same time
covering the ground with fair completeness. But perhaps
the best course to take at the present sta&c of our know-
ledge is to suspend judgment in the meanwhile, until further
light bas been cast on the subject.
Apports : The name given to various objects, such as flowers,
jewellery, and even live animals, materialised in the presence
of a medium. The production of these apports have always
been, and still are, one of the most prominent and effective
features of spiritualistic seances. Sometimes they fiy
through the air and strike the faces of the sitters ; some-
times they appear on the table, or in the laps of those
present. A favourite form is the scattering of perfume
on the company. Recent systematic experiments con-
ducted in a purely scientific spirit have exposed fraud in
numerous instances where ordinary precautions would not
have sufficed for its detection. Frequently it bas been
found that the medium had skilfully concealed the apports
in the room or about her person. Nevertheless, though
the result is often produced by obviously unscrupulous
means, it does not follow that all materialisations are per-
formed with fraudulent intent. In cases where, so far as
can be judged, the character of the nredium is beyond
reproach, as in the case of H~lene Smith, the idea has been
advanc~d tjlat any preparations made beforehand, such as
the secreting of flowers, etc., must result from a process
of activity of the sublinimal consciousness. Other ex-
planations are, that the apports are actually conveyed to
the seance by spirits, or that they arc drawn thither by
magnetic power. Branches of tre~. armfuls of fruit and
flowers, money, jewels, and live lobsters are among the
more extraordinary apports.

Aquin (Mardochee d') : A learned rabbi of Carpentras, who
died in xoso. He became a Christian, and changed his
name of Mardocl~e into Philip. He was the author of an
Interpretation of the Tree of the llebrew Kabala.
Aquinas (Thomas) who has been under the imputation of
magic, was one of the profoundest scholars and subtlest
logicians of his day. He was a youth of illustrious birth.
and received the rudiments of his education under the
monks of :IIontc Cassino, and in the University of Naples.
Aquinas 34:
But, not contented with the;e advantage;, he secretly
entered himself in the Society of Preaching Friars, or
Dominicans, at seventeen years of age. His mother, being
indignant that he should thus take the vow of poverty, and
sequester himself from the world for life, employed every
means in her power to induce him to alter his purpose, but
all in vain. The friars, to deliver him from her impor·
tunities, removed him from ~aples to Terracina, from
Tcrracina to Anagnia, and from Anagnia to Rome. His
mother followed him in all these changes of residence, but
was not permitted so much as to sec him. At length she
induced his two elder brothers to seize him by force. They
waylaid him on his road to Paris, whether he was sent to
complete his course of instruction, and carried him off to
the castle of Aquino, where he bad been born. Here he
was confined for two years, but be found a way to corres-
pond with the superiors of his order, and linally escaped
from a window in the castle. St. Thomas Aquinas (for he
was canonised after his death) exceeded perhaps all men
that ever existed in the severity and strictness of his meta·
physical disquisitions, and thus acquired the name of the
Seraphic Doctor.
It was to be expected that a man, who thus immersed
himself in the depths of thought, should be an enemy to
noise and interruption. He dashed to pieces aro artificial
man of bra.~s tl1at Albertus Magnus, who was his t utor,
had spent thirty years in bringing to perfection, being
impelled to this vaolence by its perpetual and unceasing
garrulity. It is further said, that his study being placed
in a great thorou~hfare, where the grooms were all day
long exercising thetr horses, he found it necessary to apply
a remedy to this nuisance. He made by the law,; of magic
a small horse of brass, w!lich he buried two or three feet
under ground in the midst of this highway, and, having
done so, no horse would any longer pass along the road.
It was in vain that the ~rooms with whip and spur sought
to conquer the animals repugnance. They were finally
compelled to give up the attempt, and to choose another
place for their daily exercises.
It has further been sought to fix the imputation of magic
upon Thomas Aquinas by referring to him certain books
written on that science ; but these are now acknowledged
to be spurious.
Arabs : The heyday of occultism among the Arab race was
reached at the epoch when that division of them known
as the :IIoors established their empire in the Spanish
peninsula.
We first emerge from cloud and shadow into a precise and
definite region in the eighth century, when an Arabian
mystic revived the dreams and speculations of the alche-
mists, and discovered some importantsecrets. Geber (q.v.),
who flourished about 720-750, is reputed to have written
upwards of five hundred works upon the Philosophers'
Stone and elixir vitm. His researches after these desider-
ata proved fruitless, but if h<fdid not bestow upon mankind
immortal life and bound!css wealth, he gave them nitrate
of silver, corrosive sublimate, red oxide of mercury, and
nitric acid.
Among his tenets were a belief that a preparation of
gold would heal all diseases in animals and plants, as well
as in human beings : that the metals were affected with
maladies, except the pure, supreme, and precious one of
gold ; and that the Philsophers' Stone had often been
discovered, but that its fortunate discoverers would not
reveal the secret to blind, incredulous, and unworthy man.
His S1~mma Perjectionis-a manual for the alchemical
student-has been frequently translated. A curious
English version, of which there is a copy in the British
Museum, was publishe:i by an English enthusiast, one
Richard Russell, at " the Star, in New :Market, in \Yapping,
Arabs
near the Dock," in 1686. Geber's true name was Abou
Moussah Djafar, to which wa.~ added AI Sofi., or " Tb~
Wise," and he was a native of Houran, in Mesopotamia.
He was followed by Avicenna (q.v.), Averrocs (q.v.)
and others equally gifted and fortunate.
According to Gcber and his successors the metals were
not only compound creatures, but they were also an com·
posed of the same two substances. Both Prout and Davy
lent their names to ideas not unlike this. " The improve-
ments," says the latter, " taking place in the methods of
examining bodies, are constantly changing the opinions-
of chemists with respect to their nature, and there is no
reason to suppose that any real indestructible principle
has yet been discovered. Matter may ultimately be found
to be the sam'! in essence, differing only in the arrangement
of its 'Particles; or two or three simple substances may
produce all the varieties of compound bodies." The
ancient ideas, therefore, of Demetrius the Greek physicist,
and of Gcber, the Arabian polypharmist, are still hovering
about the horizon of chemistry.
The Arabians taught, in the third place, that the metals
are composed of mercury and sulphur in different pro-
portions. They toiled away at the art of making many
medicines out of the various mixtures and reactions of
the few chemicals at their command. They believed in
transmutation, but they did not strive to efiect it. It
belonged to their creed rather than to their practice. They
were a race o£ bard-working, scientific artisans, with their
pestles and mortars, their crucibles and furnaces, their
alembics and aludels, their vessels for infusion, for decoc-
tion, for cohobation, sublimation, fixation, lixiviation,
filtration and coagulation. They believed in transmuta-
tion, in the first matter, and in the correspondence of the
metals with the planets, to say nothing of potable gold.
Whence the Arabians derived the :lublimer articles of
their scientific faith, is not known to any European histor·
ian. Perhaps they were the conjectures of their ancestors
according to the faith. Perhaps they had them from th~
Fatimite:l of ::-l'orthern Africa, among whose local pre·
dccessors it has been seen that it is just possible the doctrine
of the four clements and their mutual convertibility may
have arisen. Perhaps they drew them from Greece,
modifying and adapting them to their <?wn specific forms
of matter, mercury, sulphur and arsemc.
Astrolo~y.-Astrology was also employed by the oracles
of Spain. Albatgni was celebrat.,d for his astronomical
science, as were many others ; and in geometry, arithmetic,
algebraical calculations and the the<>ry of music, we have
a lon~ list, Asiatic and Spanish, but only known by
their laves and principal writings. The works of Ptolemy
also exercised the ingenuity of the Arabians : while
Alchindi, as far as we may be allowed to judge from his
multifarious volumes, traversed the whole circle of the
sublimer sciences. But judicial astrology, or the art of
foretelling future events from the position and influences
of the stars, was with them a favourite pursuit; and many
of their philosophers, incited by various motives, dedicated
all their labours to this futile but lucrative inquiry. They
often speak with high commendation of the iatro-mathe-
matical discipline, which could control tlte disorders to
which man was subject, and regulate the events of life.
The tenets of Jslamism, which inculcate an unreserved
submission to the ovcr-rnling destinies of heaven, arc
evidently adverse to the lessons of astrology; but this
by no means hindered the practitioner;: of old Spain and
Al'abia from attaining a high standard of perfection in the
art, which they perhaps first learned from the peoples of
Chaldma, the past masters of the ancient world in astro·
nomical science, in di~nation, and the secrets of prophecy.
But in Arab Spain, where the tenets of Islam, were per·
AradJa 35 Arlstmus
haps more lightly esteemed than in their original home,
magic unquestionably reached a higher if not more thought-
ful standard.
From the Greeks, still in search of science, the A ,-abs
turned their attention to the books of the sages who arc
esteemed the primitive instructors of mankind, among
whom Hermes was deemed the first. They mention the
works written by him, or rather by them, as they suppose,
like othtr authors. that there were three of the name.
To one the imposing appellation of Trismegistus bas been
given ; and the Arabians, from some ancient records,
we may presume, minutely describe his character and
person. They also published, as illustrative of their
astTological discipline, some writings ascribed to the
Persian Zoroaster.

Ara4lla, or tbe Gospel or the Witches or Italy : (See Italy.)
Arael : One of the spirits which the rabbi; of the T~lmud
made princes and governors over the people of the birds.
Ararlel : An angel who, according to therabb1sof the Talmud,
takes chuge of the waters of the earth. Fishermen invoke
him so that they may take large fish
Ararlta : The ve,bum inenar1'abile of the sages o! the Alex-
andrian School, ·• which Hebrew Kabalists wrote Javeh, and
interpreted by the sound Ararita, thus expressing the
triplicity of the secondary kabalistic principle, the dualism
of the means and the equal unity of the first and fmal
principle, as well as the alliance between the triad and the
triad and the tetrad i.Jl a word composed of four letter~.
which form seven by means of a triple and double repeti-
ticn!'
Arbatel : A magical ritual published at Basle in I575· The
text is in Latin, and it appears to have been influenced by
Paracelsus. It is of Christian, not Jewish origin, and
although the authorship is unknown it is probably the
work of an Italian. Only one of its nine volumes has come
down to us. It deals with thP. institucons of magic, and is
entitled Isagoge, which means essential or necessary
instruction. In it we are introduced to the ritual of the
Olympic spirits dwelling in the air and among the staTs,
who govern the world. There are, we are told, one hundred
aoq ninety-six Olympic provinces in the universe : thus
Aratron has forty-nine, Bethor forty-two, Phaleg thirty-
five, Och twenty-eight, Hagith twenty-one, Ophiel fourteen,
and Phul seven. Each of the Olympic spirits rule alter-
nately for four hundred and ninety years. They have
natural sway over certain departments of the material
world, but outside these departments they pedorm the
same operations magically. Thus Och, the ruler of sow
affairs, presides over the preparation of gold naturally
in the soil. At the same time, he presides magically over
the preparation of that metal by means of alchemy. The
Arbatel proceeds to say that the sources of occult wisdor.:t
are to be found in God, spiritual essences and corporeal
creatures, as well as in nature, but also in the apostate
spirits and in the ministers of punishment in Hell and
the elementary spirits. The secrets of all magic reside in
these, but magicians are born, not made, although they are
assisted by contemplation and the love of God. It will
be sufficient to describe the powers and offices of one of
thtse spirits. Aratron governs those things which are
ascribed astrologically to Saturn. He can convert any
living thing into stone, can change coals into treasure,
gives !amifiar spirits to men, teaches alchemy, magic and
medicine, the secret of invisibility, and long life. He
should be invoked on a Saturday in the first hour of the day.
The Arbatel is one of the best authorities extant on spiritual
essences, their powers and degrees.
Areanum, Great : The great secret which was supposed to
lie behind all alchemkal and magical striving. " God
and Nature," says Eliphas Levi (q.v.), "alike, have closed
the Sanctuary of Transcendent Science. ... so that the
revelation of the great ma~ical secret is happily impossible."
Elsewhere he states that 1t makes the magician" master of
gold and light."
Ardat-Lile : (Semitic Spirit). She is a female spirit or demon
who weds human beings· and works great harm in the
dwellings of men.
Argontum, Potal:lle : A marvellous remedy for which the al-
chemists had a recipe. It was composed of sulphur, spirits
of wine, and other ingredients, prepared accordill'g to
specified direction, and was (if we credit these authorities)
a sovereign remedy for all manner of ailments.
Ariel : A spirit. (See Beaumont, Jobn.)
Arlgnote : Lucian relates that a' Corinth, in the Cranans
quarter, there was a certain ' 1se which no one would
inhabit, because it was ha•· 1 by a spectre. A man
named A rignole, well verse<. • tbe lore of the Egyptian
magical books. shut himself 1•• :be house to p~ss the night
and began to read peacefully in the court. Soon the
spectre made its appearance, and in order to frighten
Arignote, it first of all took ~he form of a dog, then that of
a bull, and finally that of a lion. But A rignote was not at
all disturbed. He conjured the spectre in formulce which
he found in his book'!, and obliged it to retire to a corner
of tbe court, where it disappeared. On the following day
the spot to which the spectre had retteated was aug up,
and a skeleton was found. When it was properly buried,
the ghost was not seen again. This anecdote is an adapta-
tion of the adventure of Athenodorus, which Lucian bad
read in Pliny.
Arloeb : Demon of vengeance, according to some demono-
logists. He is different from Alastor, and occupies him-
self only with vengeance in particular cases where be is
employed for that purpose.
Ariollsts : Ancieot diviners, whose special occupation was
called ariolatio, because they divined by means of the altars.
They consulted demons on their.altars, says Dangis; they
observed whether the altar trembled or performed any
marvel, and predicted what the Devil inspired them with.
According to Fran~is de Ia Tour Blanche, these people
ought to bave been put to death as idolators. He based
his opinion on Deuteronomy, chap. xviii., and on Revela-
tion, chap. xxi., where it is said that idolators and liars
shall be cast into the lake of fire and sulphur, which will
be theiT second death. Deuteronomy orders only the fust.
Arlstreus : A charlatan whO lived in the time of Crresus.
He said that his soul would leave his body whenever he
mshed, and then return to it. Some maintain that it
escaped in the sight of his wife and children in the figure
of a stag. Wicrius said that it took the shape of a crow.
However that may be, Herodotus relates in his fourth
book that Aristaus entering one day Into a fuller's shop,
fell dead therein, that the fuller ran to break the news to
his parents, who came to bury him. But no corpse was
to be found. The whole town was astonished, when some
men returning from a voyagt: assured them that they had
met A1'isltBus on the way to Crotona. It appeared that
he was a species of vampire. Herodotus adds that he
reappeared at the end of seven years, composed a poem
and died anew. Lcloyer, who regarded A1'istaus as a
sorcerer or ecstatic, quoted a certain Apollonius, who said
that at the same hour as the vampire disappeared for the
second time, he was traasported to Sicily, where he became
a schoolmaster. He is again beard of three hundred and
forty years afterwards in the town of Metapontus, where
be caused to be raised certain monument'S which were to be
seen in the time of Herodotus. So many wonderful hap-
penings inspired the Sicilians mth awe, and they raised a
temple to him and worshipped him as a demi·god.
Arithmancy 36 Ash Tree
Arithmancy : (Sometimes c<~Lled wron~ly Arithmoman~y).
Divination by mean~ of numbers. The Greeks exantined
the number and value of the letters in the names of two
combatants, and predicted that he whose name contained
most letters. or letters of the ~reatest value. would be the
"ictor. It was by means of thts science that some diviners
foretold that Hector would be overcome by Achilles. The
Chaldeans, who also practised it, divided their alphabet
into three parts, each composed of seven letters, which they
attributed to the seven plRnets, in order to make predictions
from them. The Platonists and the Pythagoreans were
also strongly addicted to this method of,divination, which
comprehends also a part of the Jewish Kabala.
Armida : The episode of Armida, in Tasso, is founded on a
popular tradition related by Pierre Delancre. This skil-
ful enchantress was the daughter of Arbilan, King of
Damascus. She was brought up by an uncle, a. great
magician, who taught his niece to become a powerful
sorceress. Nature had so wdl endowed her that for per-
sonal attractions she far surpassed the most beautiful
women of the East. Her uncle sent her as a worthy foe
against the powerful Christian army that Pope Urban XI.
had collected under the leadership of Godfrey de Bouillon.
And there, says Dl'lancre, she made such havoc with her
beautiful eyes, and so channed the principal leaders of
the crusaders, that she almost ruined the hopes of the
Christians. She kept the valiant knight Renaud for<> long
time in an enchanted castle, and it was not without great
difficulty that he was disenchanted.
Armomancy : A method of divination which is effected by
the inspection of the shoulders. The ancients judged by
this means whether a vic-tim was suitable for sacrifice to the
gods.
Arnaud, Gulllaume : (See France.)
Arnoux : Author of a volume published at Rouen, in 1630,
with the title of On the Wonders of the Other World, a \vork
written in a bizarre style and calculated to disturb feeble
imaginations with its tales of visions and apparitions.
Arnuphls : An Egyptian sorcerer who, seeing Marcus Aureliw
and his army engaged in a pass whose entrance had been
closed by their enemies, and dying of thirst under a burning
sky, caused a miraculous rain to fall, which allowed the
Romans to quench their thirst, while the thunder and hail
obliged the enemy to give up their arms.
Arpbaxat : A Persian sorcerer, who was lcilled by a thunder·
bolt, according to Abdias of Babylon, at the same hour
as the martyrdom of St. Simon and St. Jude. In th~
account of the possession of the nuns of Loudun there is a
demon A rpha:rat, who took possession of th;: body of
Louise de Pinterville.
Ars Aurifera : (See Avicenna.)
Ars Cblmlca: (See Avicenna.)
Ars Notorla: The science of the Tarot (q.v.) signs and their
application to the divination of all secrets. whether of
nature, of philosophy, or even of the future.
Art Transmutatolre : (See Pope John XXII.)
Artepbius : A well-known exponent of the hermetic philo-
sophy, who rlied in the twelfth century, and is said to have
lived more than a thousand years by means of alchemical
secrets. Frans:ois Picmentions the opinion ofcertains..wants
who affirm that Artephtus is identical with Appoloruus of
Tyana, who was bom in the first century under that name,
and who died in the twelftl1 century under that of Artep-
hit~s. Many extravagant and curious works are attributed
to him : De Vita Propaxanda (The Art of Prolomjng Life)
which be claims, in the preface, to have written at the age
of a thousand and twenty-five years; The Key to St<preme
Wisdom; and a work on the character of the planets, on
the significance of the songs of birds, on things past and
future, and on tbe I'ilhosophers' Stone. Cardan spoke
of these books, and believed that they were composed by
some practical joker who wished to play on the credulity
of the partisans of alchemy.
Arthur, King : The character of Arthur is strongly identified
with the occult. Not only do we find his Court a veritable
centre of happenings more or less supernatural, but his
mysterious origin and the subsequent events of his career
have in them matter of considerable interest from an
occult star1point. This is not the place to dispute re-
garding his reality. but merely to deal with the romances
which cluster around him, and their contents from the
supernatural point of view. We find him first of all
connected with one of the greatest magical names of early
times-that of Merlin the Enchanter. The possibilities
are that :\Ierlin was originally a British deity, who in later
times de~enerated from his high position in the popular
imagination. \Ve possess many accounts concerning him,
one of which states that he was the direct offspring of
Satan himself, but that a zealous priest succeeded in
baptising him before his infernal parent could carry him
off. From Merlin. AYthur received much good advice both
magical and rational. He was present when the King
wa.s gifted with his magic sword Excalibur, which endowed
him with practical invulnerability, and all through his
career was deep in his counsels. His tragic imprisonment
by the Lady Viviana, who shut him up eternally in a rock
through the agency of one of his own spells, removed him
from his sphere of activity at the Arthurian Court, and
from that time the shadows may be seen to gather swiftly
around Arthur's head. Innumerable are the tales con-
cerning the Knights of his Court who met with magical
adventures, and as the stories grew older in the popular
mind. additions to these naturally became the rule. Notably
is this the case in that off-shoot of the Arthurian epic, which
is known as the Holy Grail (q.v.), in which we 1ind the
knights who go in quest of it constantly encountered by
every description of sorcery for the purpose of retarding
their progress. Arthur's end is as strange as his origin,
for we find him wafted away by faery hands, or at least by
invisible agency, to the Isle of Avillion, which probably
is one and the same place \vith the Celtic other-world across
the ocean. As a legend and a tradition, that of Arthur
is undoubtedly the most powerful and persistent in the
British imagination. lt has employed the pens and
enhanced the dreams of many of the giants in English lit-
erature from the time of Geoffrey of :\lonmouth, to the pre-
sentday; and with the echoes of the poetry of Tennyson and
Swinburne still ringing in their cars, the present generation
is quite as justified in regarding the history of AYthur as a
living reality as were the Britons of tbe twelfth century.
Artois, Countess of : (See France.)
Asal : Known as the King of the Golden Pillars, in Irish
Celtic2vlyth. He was the owner ofseven S\vine, which might
be killed and eaten every night, yet were found alive every
morning.
Asbestos : Asbestos is so called from being inextinguishable
even by showers and storms, if once set on lire. The Pagans
made use of it !or lights in their temples. It is of woolly
texture, and is sometimes called the Salamander's feather.
Leonardus says : " Its fire is nourished by an inseparable
unctuous humid flowing from its substance ; therefore,
being once kindled, it preserves a constant light without
feeding it with any moisture."
Ascleplus : A hermetic book. (S~e Hermes Trismegistus.)
Ash Tree : The Ash h~d a wonderful influence. The old
Christmas log was of ash wood, and the use of it at this
time was helpful to the future prosperity of the family.
Venomous animals, it was said. would not take shelter
under its branches. A carriage \vith its axles made of
ash wood was believed to go faster than a carriage with its
Ashipu 37
axles made of any other wood : and tools with handles
made of this wood were supposed to enable a man to do
more work than be could do with tools whose bandies
were not of ash. Hence the reason that ash wood is gener-
ally used for tool handles. It was upon ash branches that
witches were enabled to ride through the air ; and those
who ate on St. John's eve the red buds of the tree, were
rendered invulnerable to witches' influence.
Ashipu : (See Babylonia.)
Ashtabula Poltergeist, The : The supposed cause of the
extraordinary disturbances which took place about the
middle of the uineteenth century in the presence of a lady
of Ashtabula County, Ohio. First of all she became a
medium on the death of her husband, and produced spirit-
rappings and other manifestations. Then for a time she
studied anatomy in Marlborough, and aftenvards returned
to her home in Austinburg, where an alarming outbreak
of weird manifestations occurred. Stair-rods moved after
her when she went to her room, light articles flew about
the house, and uncanny sounds were heard'. At ·1\-Iarl-
borough, when she resumed her anatomical studies, the
disturbances increased in violence, and she and her room-
mate had a ghastly vision of a corpse they had been dis-
secting in the day-time. Dr. Richmond, a sceptic of the
day, maintained that these phenomena were the result
of magneto-odylic emanations from the medium.
Asiah : According to the l<abala, the first of the three classes
or natural ranks among the spirits of men, who must ad-
vance from the lower to the higher.
Asipu : Caste o! priests. (See Semites.)
Aspects, Planetary : (See Astrology.)
Aspldomancy : A little known form of divination practised
in the Indies, as we arc told by some travellers. Del-
ancre says that the diviner or sorcerer traces a circle, takes
up his position therein seated on a buckler, and mutters
certain conjurations. He becomes entranced and falls
into an ecstasy, from which he only emerges to tell things
that his client wishes to know, and which the devil has
revealed to him.
Aspilette {Marie d') : Wi~ch of Andaye, in the country of
Labour, who lived in the reign of Henry IV. She was
arrested at the age of ninetet!n years, and confessed that
she had been led to the " sabbath," and there made to
perform divers horrible rites.
Ass : The Egyptians traced his image on the cakes they
offered to Typhon, god of evil. The Romans regarded
the meeting of an ass as an e\·il omen, but the animal was
honoured in Arabia and Judea, and it was in Arabia that
the ass of Silanus spoke to his master. Other talking asses
were Balaam's ass, which Mahomet placed in his paradise
with Alborack ; the ass of Aasis, Queen of Sheba ; and
the ass on which jesus Christ rode into Jerusalem.
Some people have found something sacred and mysterious
in the innocent beast, and there was practised formerly a
species of divination in which the bead of an ass was
employed.
At one time a special festival was held for the ass, during
which he was led into the church wliile mass was sung.
This reverence in which he was held by Christians was
doubtless due to the black cross which he wears on his back,
and which, it is said, was given him because of the ass of
Bethphage, who carried Christ into Jerusalem. But
Pliny, who was almost contemporary with that ass, and
who has carefully gathered all that related to the animal,
has made no mention concerning the colour of its coat !
So we can only believe that the ass ofto-day is as he always
was.
Jt is not only the devout who respect the ass, for the
wise Agrippa offered him an apology in his book, On the
Vanity of the Sciences. Among the Indians of Madras,
Ass
one of the principal castes, that of the Cavaravadonques,
claim to be descended from an ass. These Indians treat
the ass as a brother, take his part, and prosecute those who
over-burden or ill-treat him in any way. In rainy weather
they will often give him shelter when they deny it to his
driver.
An old fable gives us but a poor idea of the ass. Jupiter
had just taken possession of Olympus. On his coming,
men asked of him an eternal springtime, which he accord-
ingly granted, charging the ass of Silenus to bear the
precious treasure to earth. The ass became thirsty. and
approached a fountain guarded by a sn<~ke, who refused
to let the ass drink unless he parted with the treasure.
The stupid animal thereupon bartered the gift of heaven
for a skin of water, and since that time snakes, when they
grow old, can change their sl..-in and become young again,
for they have the gift of perpetual spring-time.
But a!.l asses were not so stupid as that. In a village
about half a league from Cairo, there dwelt a mountebank,
who possessed a highly trained ass, so clever that the
country people took it to be a demon in disguise. One
day the mountebank mentioned in the ass's hearing that
the Soldan wished to construct a beautiful building, and
had resolved to employ all the asses in Cairo to carry the
lime, mortar and stones. The ass immediately lay down
and pretended to be dead. and his master begged for money
to buy another. When he had collected some he returned
to his old ass. "He is not dead," he said, " he only pre-
tended to die because he knew I had not the wherewithal
to buy him food." Still the ass refused to rise, and the
mountebank addmssed the company, telling them that
the Soldan had sent out the criers commanding the people
to assemble on the morrow outside Cairo to see the most
wonderful sights in the world. He further desired that
the most gracious ladies and the most beautiful girls should
be mounted on asses. The ass raised himself and pricked
up his ears. " The governor of my quarter," added the
mountebank, " bas begged me to lend my ass for his wife,
who is old and toothless. and very ugly." The ass began
to limp as though he were old and lame. " Ab, you like
beautiful ladies ? " said his master. The animal bowed
his bead. "Oh, well," said the man, "there are many
present; show me the most beautiful." Which command
the ass obeyed ,,;th judgment and discretion.
These marvcl!ous asses, said the demonologists, were,
if not demons, at least men metamorphosed, like Apuleius,
who was. it is said, transformed into an ass. Vincent de
Beauvais speaks of two women who kept a little inn ncar
Rome, and who sold their guests at the market, after having
changed them into pigs, fowls, or sheep. One or them, he
adds, changed a certain comedian into an ass, 3:nd as he
retained his talents under his new skin, she led h1m to the
fairs on the outskirts of the city, gaining much money
thereby. A neighbour bought this wise ass at a good price,
and in handing ft over the sorcerers felt obliged to warn the
purchaser not to let the ass enter water. Its new master
attended to the warning for some time, but one day the
poor ass managed to get free and cast itself into a la~e.
when it regained its natural shape, to the great·surpnse
of its driver. The matter was brought to the ears of the
Pope. wh<> had the two witches -l'unished. while the comed-
ian returned to the exercise of h1s profession.
Many stories are told of the ass which carried Jesus
Christ into Jerusalem, and which is said to bave died 3:t
Verona, where its remains are still honoured. The rabbis
make quite as much aoo over Balaam's ass, which bas
already been mentioned. It is, they say, a privileged
animal whom God formed at the end of the sixth day.
Abraham employed it to carry the wood for the sacrifice
of Isaac ; it also carried the wlfe and son of Moses in the
Assassins 38
desert. They also maintain that Balaam's ass is carefully
nourished and kept in a secret place until the coming of
the Jewish Messiah, who will mount it when He subdues all
the earth.
Assassins : (Hashishin, so-called from their use of the drug
hasltish, distilled from the hemp plant). A branch of that
sect of Mabomedans known as Jsmaelites. founded in the
latter part of the elevent'!l cer.tury by Hassan Sabah,. in
Syria and Persia. Driven from Cairo, Hassan spread a
modified form of the lsmaelite doctrine throughout Syria,
and in 1090 he became master of the mountain stronghold,
Alamut, in Persia, where he founded a society known as
the Assassins, and from which he ostensibly promulgated
the principles of the Ismaelite sect. The difference, how-
ever, between the Assassi11s and other Ismaelites, was that
they employed secret assassination against all the enemies
of the sect. Their organisation was founded upon that
of the Western Lodge at Cairo, and at the head of their
sect was the Sheik-Al-Gebe!, or" O!d Man of the Mountain,"
as the name has been rather absurdly translated by Europ-
eans authors, the more correct translation being " Chief
of the mountain." The other officers of the society were
the grand priors, lesser priors. initiates, associates. and the
fedavi or " devoted ones," who were the assassi11s proper.
These latter were young men from whose ranks those who
were selected for the ,·arious deeds of blood for which the
Assassins became notorious. were chosen. They were
not initiated into the secret circle of the cult, and blind
obedience was expected from them. When their services
were required they were intoxicated with hashish, and in
this condition were taken into the magnificent gardens of
the Sheik, where they were surrounded by every pleasure.
This they were told was a for<>taste of what they might
expect in Paradise, to which they would instantly proceed
were they to lose their Ji,·es in the Sheik's service. Con-
seq~:ently these youn~ men, for the most part ignorant
pea;;ants, displayed a degree of fanaticism which made them
the fitting instruments of Hassan's policy. But the
initiated amongst the Assassins were convinced of the
worthlessness of religion and morality, held no belief, and
sneered covertly at the Prophet and his religion.
The early history of the society is one of romantic and
absorbing interest. Has::1n had been a member of a
secret Ismaelite society at Cairo, the head of which was
the Caliph, " and of which the.object was the dissemination
of the doctrines of the sect of the lsmaelites....
" Tbis society, we arc told, comprised both men and
women, who met in separate assemblies, for the common
supposition of the insignificance of the latter sex in the
enst. is erroneous. It was presided over by the Chief
Missionary (Dai-ol-Dont) who was always a person of
importance in the slate, and not infrequently Supreme
Judge (J(adlli-al-J(odhat). Their assemblies, called Societies
of Wisdom (Mejatis-ai-Hiemtl), were held twice a week, ory.
Mondays aad Wednesdays. All the members appeared
clad in whi1e. The president. having first waited on the
Caliph, and read to him the intended lecture, or, if that
could not be done, having got his signature on the back
of it. proceeded to the assembly and delivered a written
discourse. At the conclusion of it, those present kissed
his hand and reverently touched with their forehead the
handwriting of the Caliph. Iu this state the society con-
tinued till the reign of lhat extraordinary madman, the
Caliph Haken-bi-emr-ilhh (Judge by the Command of
God), who determined to place it on a splendid footing.
Ha erected for it a stately edifice, styled the House of
Wisdom (Dar-al-hicmel), abundanti¥ furnished with books
and mathematical instruments. Its doors were open to
all, and paper, pens and ink were profusely'supplied for
the use of those who eho3e to frequent it. Profc.ssors of
Assassins
law, mathematics, logic, and medicine were appointed to
give instructions; and at the learned disputations which
were frequently held in presence of the Caliph, these
professors appeared in their state caftans (Khalao), which,
it is said, exactly resembled the robes worn at lhe English
universities. The income assigned to this cstaNishment
by the munificence of the Caliph, was 257.000 ducats an-
nually, arising from the tenths paid to the crown.
" The course of instruction in this university proceeded,
according to Macrisi. by the following nine degrees. (I)
The object of the first, which was long and tedious, was to
infuse doubts and difficulties into the mind of the aspirant,
and to lead him to repose a blind confidence in the know-
ledge and wisdom of his t<'acher. To this end he was
perplexed with captious questions; the absurdities ,,£ the
literal sense of the Koran and its repugnance to reason,
were studiously pointed out, and dark hints were given
that beneath this shell lay a kernel sweet to the taste and
nutritive to the soul. But all further information was
most rigorously withheld till he had consented to bind
himself by a most solemn oath to absolute faith and blind
obedience to his instru<;tor. (2) When he had taken the
oath he was admitted to the second degree, which. in-
culcated the acknowledgement of the imams appointed
by God as the sources o/ all knowledge. (3) The third
degree informed him what was the number of these blessed
and holv imams; and this was the mystic seven ; for,
as God had made seven heaven!', seven earths, seas, planets,
metals, tones, and colours, so seven was the number of
these noblest of God's creatures. (4) In the fourth de-
gree the pupil learned that God had sent seven lawgivers
into the world, each of whom was commissioned to alter
and improve the system of his prepecessor ; that each of
these had seven helpers, who a!'peared in the interval
between him and !lis successor; these helpers, as they
did not appear as public teachers, were called the mute
(samit\, in contradistinction to the speaking lawgivers.
The seven lawgivers were Adam, ~oah, Abraham, Moses,
Jesus, :'.fohammed, and Ismael, the son of Jaaffer; the
seven principal helpers, called Seats (soos) were Seth. Shem.
Ishmael (the son of Abraham), Aaron, Simon, Ali, and
:'.lohammed, the son of Ismael. It is justly observed that,
as this la.-;t personage was not more th:m a century dead,
the teacher had it in his power to fix on whom he would as
the mute prophet of the present time, and inculcate the
belief in, and obedience to, him of all who had not s:ot
beyond this degree. (5) The fifth degree taught that
each of the seven mute projlhcts had twelve apostles for
the dissemination of his fa1th. The suitableness of this
number was also proved by analogy. There are twelve
signs of the Zodiac, twelve month<;, twelve tribes of Israel,
twelve joints in the four fingers of each hand, and so forth.
(6) The pupil being led thus far, and having shown no
symptoms of re~tiveness, the precepts of the Koran were
once more brought under consideration, and he was told
that all the positive portions of religion must be subordinate
to philosophy. He was consequently instructed in the
systems of Plato and Aristotle during the long space of
time ; and (7) when esteemed fully qualified, he was ad-
mitted to the seventh degree, when instruction was com-
municated in that mystic Pantheism, which is hdd and
taught by the sect of the Soofees. (8) The positive
precepts of religion were again considered, the veil was
tom from the eyes of the aspirant. all that har'l preceded
wa~ now dPclared to have been merely scafiolding to raise
the edifice of knowledge, and was to be flung down.
Prophets and teachers, heaven and hell. all were not!Ling ;
future 1-liss and misery were idle dream~ ; all act.ons were
permitte:t. (9) The ninth degree had onlr to inculcate
that nought was to be believed. everything might be done."
Assassins 39
It is worthy of mention that one of Hassan's early
intimates was the famous Omar I<hayyam, with whom he
and another friend contracted a bargain that the most
successful of the three would share his good fortune with
the ot'hers. It is likely that the practical mystic and the
astrologer would feel drawn to each other by many com-
mon tastes, but we do not learn that Omar profited much
from the bargain so far as Hassan was concerned. The
third of the friends. Nizam-al-:\felk, achieved an exalted
position as vi~ier to the second of the Seljuk monarchs,
and calling to mind his promise offered Omar a post u:>.der
the government, but the author of the Rubaiyat was too
addicted to pleasure to accept active employment, and
in lieu of the da~zling position offered him, was content
with a pension of 1,200 ducats, with which he went into
·retirement.
Hassan clearly perceived that the plan of the society at
Cairo wa~ defective as a means of acquiring temporal power.
The Dais might exert themselves and proselytes might be
gained, but till possession was obtained ofsome strongholds,
and a mode of striking terror into princes devised, nothing
effectual could be achieved.
With this object in view he instituted the Fedavi,
who unhesitatingly obeyed their chief, and, without
inquiry or hesitation, plunge their daggers into the bosom
of whatever victim was pointed out to them, even though
their own lives should be the immediate sacrifice. The
ordinary dress of the Fedavi was (like that of all the sects
opposed to the house of Abbas), white; their caps, girdles,
or boots, were red. Hence they were named the White
(M'ubeiyazalz), and the Red (iUuhammere); but they could
with case assume any guise, oven that of the Christian
monk, to accomplish their murderous designs.
Hassan was perfectly aware that without the compressing
power of posihve religion, no society can well be held to-
gether. Whatever, therefore, his pri·Fate opinions may
have been, he resolved to impose on the bulk of his fol-
lowers the mo;St rif:d obedience to the pCisitivc precepts of
Islam, and, actually put his own son to death for a breach
of one of them.
Hassan is said to have rejected two of the degree~ of the
Ismaelite society at Cairo, and to have reduced them to
seven, the origin~! number in the plan of Abdallah ~faimoon,
the first projector of this secret society Besides these
seven degrees, through which the aspirants gradually
rose to knowledge, Hassan, in what Hammer terms the
breviary of the order, drew up seven regulations or rules
for the conduct of the teachers in his society. (1) The
first of these, named Ashinai-Risk (Knowledge of Duty),
inculcated the requisite knowledge of human nature. for
selE"ctin~ fit persons lor admission. To this belong the
proverbta! expressions saiil to have been current among
the Dais, similar to ~hose used by the ancient Py-tbagoreans,
such as " Sow not on barren ground •· (that is, " \'Vaste
not your labour on in<'npable persons), ·• Speak not in a
hou~e where there is ll lamp" (that is, "Be silent in the
presence of a lawyer"). (2) The second rule was called
T~nis (Gaining of Confidence), and taught to win the
candidates by flattering their passions and inclinations.
(3) The third, of which the name is not given, taught
to involve them in doubts and difiiculties by pointing out
the absurdities of the Koran, and of positive religion.
(4) When the aspirant had gone thus far, the '3olemn
oath of silence and obedience, and of commu.1icating his
doubts to his teacher alone was to be imposed on the
di~ciple ; and then (5) he was to be informed that the
doctrines and opinions of the society wor~ those of the
~reatest men in church and state. (6) The Tessees
(Confirmation) directed to put the pupil again through all
he had learned, and to con6rrn him in it. And, (7) finally,
Assassins
the Teevil (Instruction in Aller;ory) gave the allegorical
mode of interprP.ting the Koran, and drawing whatever
sense might suit. their purposes from its pages. Any one
who bad gone tbrou~h this course of instruction. and was
thus become perfectly imbued v.i.th the spirit of the society,
was regarded as an accomplished Dai, and employed in
the important office of making proselytes and extending
its influence.
Soofeism, a doctrine of this society, which is a kind of
mystic Pantheism. viewing God in all and all in Gcd, may
produce, like fatalism, piety or its opposite. Jn the eyes
of one who thus views God, all .the distinctions tetween
vice and virtue become fleeting an'd uncertain, and crime
may gradually lose its atrocity, and he regarded as only
a means for the production of a good end. That the
Ismaelite Fedavi murdered innocent persons \\i.tbout
compunction, when ordered so to do by his superiors, is
an undoubted fact, and there is no absurdity in supposing
that he and they may have thought that in so doing they
were acting rightly and promoting the cause of truth.
The followers of Hassan Sabah were called the Eastern
Ismaelites, to distinguish them from those of Africa.
They were also named the Batiniyel:. (Internal or Secret),
from the secret meaning which they drew from the text
of the Koran, and l\Ioolhad, or Moolahid (Im.vious) on
account of the imputed impiety of their doctrines-names
common to them with most of the preceding sects. It
is under this last appellation that they were known. to
Marco Polo, the Venetian traveller. The name, however,
by which they arc best known in Europe, and which we
employ, is that of Assassins. This name ~s vex:: generally
derived from that of the founder of thotr soctety ; but
l\1. De Sacy has mnde it probable that the Oriental term
Hashishitr, of which the Crusaders made Assassi?Zs, comes
(as already noted) from Hashish, a species of hemp, from
which intoxicating opiates were made, which the Ftdavi
were in the hauit of taking previously to engaging in their
daring enterprises, or employed as a medium of procuring
delicious visions of the paradise promised to them by
the Sheikb-al-Gobcl.
It is a curious question bow Hassan contrived to infuse
into the Fedaui the recklessness of life, joined with the
spirit of implicit obedience to the commands of their
superiors, which they so invariably displayed. We are
told that the system adopted for this purpose was to obtain,
by purchasing or otherwise, from their parents, stout and
healthy children. These were reared up in implicit
obedience to the will of the Sheik, and, to fit them for their
future office, carefully instructed in various languages.
The Assassim soon began to make themselves felt as a
power in Persia and Syria. Their first victim was that
very Nizam with whom Hassan and Omar had completed
their youthful bargain. His son speedily followed him,
as did the Sultan of Persia. That monarch's successor
made war with them, but was so terror-stricken by their
murderous tactics, that he speedily cemented a peace.
Hassan died at an advanced age in I l24, having assassin-
ated both his sons, and left as his successor his chief prior,
Hia-busurg-Omid, during the reigll of whom the Assassins
were far from fortunate. The list of their victims had by
this time become a long and illustrious one. The fourth
Sheik of the Mountain-another Hassan-made public
the secret doctrines of the society, announcing tbat the
religion of Islam was abolished and that the people might
give themselves up to feasting and pleasure. He further
stated that he was the promisod Caliph of God upon earth;
but some four years after this announcement he was
assassinated and succeeded by his son; Mabomed II. whose
rule of forty-six years was marked by deeds of revolting
cruelty. But he had several implacable enemies, one of
Assassins 40
whom was the famous Saladin, and the Syrian branch of
the society seceded from his sway, and became independent.
This branch it was with whom the Crusaders came so
much into contact, and whose emissaries slew Raymond
of Tripoli, and Conrad of Montferrat. I\Iahomed's son,
Hassan III., restored the old form of doctrine--that is,
the people were strictly confined t().the practice of Islam,
whilst the initiates were as before, superior and agnostic.
His was the only reign in which no assassinations occurred
and be was regarded with friendship by his neighbours.
But after a reign of twelve years, he was poisoned. and
during the minority of his son assassination was greatly
in vogue. After a reign of thirty years, Mabomed III., the
son in question, was slain by his successor, Rukneddin ;
but vengeance quickly followed, for only a year later the
Tartars swept into Persia, took Alamut and other Assassin
strongholds. and captured the reigning monarch, who
was slain because of his treachery. Over n,ooo Assassins
were massacred, and their power was completely broken.
The like fate overtook the Syrian branch, which was
nearly extirpated by the Egyptian Mamelukes. But in
the more isolated valleys of Syria, many of them lingered
on and arc believed still to exist there. At all ev.ents,
doctrines similar in character to theirs are occasionally
to be met with in Northern Syria. An account of the
manner in which the Assassins aroused the lust of slaughter
in the Fedavis is given in Siret-al-Hakm, c.r Memoirs of
Hakin-an Arabic historic romance, as follows:-
.. Our narrative now returns to Ismael the chief of the
Ismaelites. He took with him his people laden with gold,
silver, pearls, and other effects, taken away from the in-
habitants of the coasts, and which he bad received in the
island of Cyprus, and on the part of the King of Egypt,
Dhaher, the son of Hakem-biemr-Illah. Having bidden
farewell to the Sultan of Egypt at Tripolis, they proceeded
to Massyat, when the inhabitants of the castles and
fortresses assembled to enjoy themselves, along with the
chief Ismael and his people. They put on the rich dresses
with which the Sultan had supplied them, and adorned
the castle of l\fassyat with everything that was good and
fine. Ismael made his entry into Massyat with the Devoted
(Fedavs), as no one has ever done at Massyat before him
or after him. He stopped there some time to take into
his service some more persons whom he might make
devoted both in heart and body.
" With this view be had caused to be made a vast garden,
into which he had water conducted. In the middle of this
garden he built a kiosk raised to the height of four stories.
On each of the four sides were richly-ornamented windows
joined by four arches. in which were painted stars of gold
and silver. He put into it roses, porcelain. glasses, and
drinking-vessels of gold and silver. He had with him
Mamlooks (i.e., slaves), ten males and ten females, who
were come with him from the region of the Nile, and who
had scarcely attained the age of puberty. He clothed
them in silks and in the finest stuffs, and he gave unto them
bracelets of gold and of silver. The columns were over-
laid with musk, and with amber, and in the four arches
of the v·
:indows he set four caskets, in which was the purest
musk. The columns were polished, and this place was
the retreat of the slaves. He divided the garden into four
parts. In the first of these were pear-trees, apple-trees,
vines, cherries, mulberries, plums, and other kinds of
fruit-trees. In the second were oranges, lemons, olives,
pomegranates, and other fruits. In the third were cucum-
bers, melons, leguminous plants, etc. In the fourth were
roses, jessamine, tamarinds, narcissi, violets, lilies,
anemomes, etc., etc.
" The garden was divided by canals of ·1vater, and the
kiosk was surrounded with ponds and r~servoirs. There
Assassins
were groves in which were seen antelopes. ostriches, asses,
and wild cows. Issuing from the ponds, one met ducks,
geese, partridges, quails, hares, foxes, and other animals.
Around the kiosk the chief Ismael planted walks of tall
tree.:;. terminating in the different parts of the garden.
He built there a great house, divided into two apartments,
the upper and the lower. From the latter covered walks
led out into the garden, which was all enclosed v.'itb walls,
so that no one could see into it, for these walks and buildings
were all void of inhabitants. He made a gallery of cool-
ness. which ran from this apartment to the cellar, which
was behind. This apartment served as a place of assembly
for the men. Having placed himself on a sofa there
opposite the door, the chieC made his men sit down, and
gave them to cat and drink during the whole length of
the day until evening. At nightfall he looked around him,
and, selecting those whose firmness pleased him, said t()
them, • Ho I such-a-one, come and seat thyself near me.'
It is thus that Ismael made those whom be had chosen
sit near him on the sofa and drink. He then spoke to
them of the g~at and excellent qualities of the imam Ali,
of his bravery, his nobleness, and his generosity, until
they fell asleep, overcome by the power of the benjeh which
be bad given them, and which never failed to produce its
effects in less than a quarter of an hour, so that they fell
down as if they were inanimate. As soon as the man had
fallen the chief lsmael arose, and, taking biro up, brought
him into a dormitory, and then, shutting the door, carried
him on his shoulders into the gallery of coolness, which
was in the ~arden, and thence into the kiosk, where he
committed h1m to the care of the male and female slaves,
directing them to comply with all the desires of the can-
didate, on whom they flung vinegar till he awoke. When
he was come to himself the youths and maidens said to
him '\Ve are only waiting for thy death, for this place
is destined for thee. This is one of the pavilions of Para-
dise, and we are the bouries and the children of Paradise.
If thou wert dead thou wouldest be for ever with us, but
thou art only dreaming, and wilt soon awake.' Mean-
while, the chief I smael had returned to the company as
soon as he had witnessed the awakening of the candidate,
who now perceived nothing but youths and maidens of
the greatest beauty, and adorned in the most magnificent
manner.
" He looked around the place, inhaled the fragrance of
musk and frankincense, and drew near to the garden. where
be saw the beasts and the birds, the running water, and
the trees. He gazed on the beauty of the kiosk, and the
vases of gold and silver, while the youths and maidens.
kept him in converse. In this way he remained confounded,
not knowing whether he was awake or only dreaming.
When two hours of the night had gone by, the chief Ismael
returned to the dormitory, closed to the door. and thence
proceeded to the ~arden. where his slaves came around him
and rose before h1m: When the candidate perceived him,
he said unto him, ' 0, chief Ismacl, do I dream, or am I
awake ? ' The chief Ismael then made answer to him •
' 0, such-a-one beware of relating this vision to any one
who is a stranger to this place I I<now that the Lord Ali
has shown thee the place which is destined for thee in
Paradise. Know that at this moment the Lord Ali and I
have been sitting together in the regions of the empyrean.
So do not hesitate a moment in the service of the imam
who has given thee to know his felicity.' Then the chief
Ismael ordered supper to be served. It was brought in
vessels of gold and of silver, and consisted of boiled meats
and roast meats, with other dishes. While the candidate ·
ate, be was sprinkled with rose-water; when he called for
drink there were brought to him vessels of gold and silver
filled with delicious liquors, in which also had been mingled
Asteroids 41 Astral World
some benjek. Wl1en he had fallen a~leep, Ismael carried
him through the gallery back to the dormitory, and, leaving
him there•. returned to his com~,>any. After a little time
he went back, threw vinegar on hts face, and then, bringing
him out, ordered one of the Mamlooks to shake him. On
awaking, and finding himself in the same place among the
guests, he said . • There is no god but God, and Mohammed
is the Prophet of God I ' The chief Ismael then drew near
and caressed him, and he remained, as it were, immersed
in intoxication, wholly devoted to the service of the chief,
who then said unto htm. • 0, such-a-one, know that what
thou hast seen was not a dream, but one of the miracles
of the imam Ali. Know that he bas written thy name
among those of his friends. If thou keep the secret thou
art certain of thy felicity, but if thou speak of it thou wilt
incur the resentment of the imam. If thou die thou art a
martyr; bot beware of relating this to any person what-
ever. Thou bast entered by one of the gates to the friend-
ship of the imam, and art become one of his family ; but
if thou betray the secret, thou wilt become one of his
enemies, and be driven from his house.' Thus this man
became one of the servants of the chief lsmacl. who in this
manner surrounded himself with trusty men, until his
reputation was established. This is what is related to
the chief Ismael and his Devoted.''
To these romantic tales of the Paradise of the Old Man of
the Mountain we must add to another of an even more
my::;tical character, furnished by the learned and venerable
Sheik Agd-ur-Rabman (Servant of the Compassionate,
i.e., of God) Ben Ebubekr Al-Jeriri of Damascus, in the
twenty-fourth chapter of his work entitled, A Cltoice Book
for Discovering the Sect'ets of the Art of Imposture.
Asteroids : (See Astrology.)
Astolpho : A hero of Italian romance. He was the son of
Otho, King of England. He was transformed into a
myrtle by Alcina, a sorceress, but later regained his human
form through Melissa. He took part in many adventures,
and cured Orlando of his madness. A stolphc is the alle-
gorical representation of a true man lo~t through sensuality.
Astral Body is in Theosophy that body which functions
in the Astral World. Like the rest of man's five bodies, it
is composed of matter, relatively, however, much finer
than that which composes the ordinary physical body. It
is the instrument of passions, emotions, and desires, and,
since it interpenetrates and extends beyond the physical
body, it is the medium throu~ which these are conveyed
to the latter. When it separates from the denser body-
as it does during sleep, or by the influence of drugs, or
as the result of accidents-it takes with it the capacity
for feeling, and only with its return can pain or any other
such phenomena be felt. During these periods of separa-
tion the astral body is;an exact replica of the physical, and
as it is extremely sensith:e to thought, the apparitions of
dead and dying-of which so much is heard in the new
science of the Borderland-resemble even to the smallest
details the physical bodies which they have lately left.
The Astral World is, of course, easily attainable to clair-
voyants of even moderate powers, and the appropriate
body is therefore clearly visible. In accordance with
theosophic teaching on the subject of thought, the latter
is not the abstraction it is commonly considered to be,
but built up of definite forms the shape of which depends
on the quality of the thought, and it also causes definite
vibrations, which arc seen as colours. Hence, clairvoyants
are able to tell the state of a mans development from the
appearance of his astral body. A nebulous appearance
betokens imperfect development, while an ovoid appearance
betokens a more perfect development. As the colours
are indicative of the kind of thought, the variety of these
in the astral body indicates the possessor's charatter.
Inferior thoughts beget loud colours, so that rage, for
instance, will be recognised by the red appearance of the
4stral body, and on the contrary, higher thoughts will be
recognisable by the presence of delicate colours, religious
thought for instance, causing a blue colour. This teaching
holds true for the bodies higher than the astral, but, the
coloration of the astral body is much more familiar to
dwellers in the \'hysical world than is the coloration of the
higher bodies, Wlth the feelings of which they are relatively
unacquainted. There is a definite theory underlying the
emotional and other functions of the astral body. The
- matter of which the latter is composed is not, of course,
alive with an intelligent life, but it nevertheless possesses
a kind of life sufficient to convey an understanding of its
own existence an~ wants. The stage of evolution of this
life is that of descent. the turning point not having yet,
so far as it is concerned, been reached. He who possesses·
the' body has, on the other hand, commenced to ascend,
and there is, therefore, a continual opposition of forces
between him and his astral body. Hence, his astral body
accentuates in him such of ~rosser, retrograde thoughts
as he may nourish since the direction of these thoughts
coincides with its own direction. If, however, he resists the
opposition of his astral body, the craving of the latter gradu-
aJly becomes weaker and weaker till at last itdisappears al-
together. And the constitution of the astral body is thereby
altered, gross thoughts demanding for their medium gross
astral matter, pure thoughts demanding fine astral matter.
During physical life the various kinds of matter in the
astral body are intermingled, but at physical death the ele-
mentary life in the matter of tbe astral body seeks in-
stinctively after self-preservation, and it therefore causes
the matter to rearrange itself in a series of seven concen-
tric sheaths, the densest being outside and the finest
inside. Physical vision depends on the eyes, but astral
vision depends on the various kinds of astraf matter being
in a condition of receptiveness to differl'nt undulations.
To be aware of fine matter, fine matter in the astral body
is necessary, and so with the other kinds. Hence, when
the rearrangement takes place, vision only of the grossest
kinds of matter is possible since only that kir.d is repre-
sented in the thick outer sheath of the astral body. t;nder
these circumstances, the new denizen of the astral sphere
sees only the worst of it, and also only the \\Orst of his
fellow denizens, even though they arc not in so low a state
as himself. This state is not, of course eternal, and in
accordance with the evolutionary prOC<'SS, the gross sheath
of astral matter wears slowly away, and the man remains
clothed with the six less gross sheaths. These also, ·with
the passage of time, wear away, being resolved into their
compound elements, and at last when the final disintegra-
tion of the least gross sheath of an takes place, the in-
dividual leaves the Astral World and passes into the 1\lental.
This rearrangement of the astral body is not, however, in-
evitable. and tbose who have learned and know, are able
at physical death to prevent it. In such cases the change
appears a very small one, and the so-called dead continue
to live their lives and do their work much as they did in
the physical body. (See Astral World, Avlehl Theosophy.)
Astral World. (Plane or Sphere) : Kama World is, in
Theosophy, the second lowest of the seven worlds, the
world of emotions, desires, and passions. Into it man
passes at physical death, and there he functions for periods
which vary with the state of his development, the primitive
savage spendin~ a relatively short time in the Astral
Wot-ld, the civilised man spending relatively longer. The
appropriate body is the astral (q.v.), which though com-
posed of matter as is the physical body, is nevertheless of
a texture vastly finer than the latter. Though it is in its
aspect of the after-<leath abode that this world is of most
Astral World 42 Astrology
importance and most interest. it may be said in passing,
that even during physical life, man-not only clairvoyants
who attain it easily. but also ordinary men- may and do
temporarily inhabit it. This happens during 'sleep, or
by reason of the action of alla'sthetics or drugs, or accidents,
and the interpenetrating astral body then leaves its denser
physical neighbour, and takin~ wi~ i~ the sense of pleasure
and pain. hves for a short nme m 1ts own world. Here
again the state of the savage differs from that of bis more
advanced fellows, for the former does not travel far from
his immediate surroundings, while the latter may perform
useful, helpful work for the benefit of humanity. Further,
it may io pa.ssing be noted that disembodied mankind are
not the only inhabitants of the Astral World, for very many
of its inhabitants are of an altogether non-human nature-
lower orders of the devas or angels, and nature-spirits or
elementals, both good and, bad, such including fairies
which are just beyond the powers of human vision, and
the demons present to the vision of <lelirium tremens. It
will however be sufficient now to turn attention to the
Astral World as the state immediately following physical
death and containing both heaven and hell as these are
popubrly conceived.
There are seven divisions which correspond to the seven
divisions of matter, the solid, liquid, gaseous. etheric,
super-etheric, suba~omic and atomic, and, as mentioned
in the article on the Astral Body. this plays a most im-
portant part in the immediate destiny of man in it. If
through ignorance, he has permitted the rearrangement
of the matter of his astral body into sheaths, he is cognisant
only of part of his surroundings at a time, and it is not till
after experience, much of which may be extremely painful,
that he 1Sable to enjoy the bliss which the higher divisions
of the Astral World contain. The lowest of these divisions,
the seventh, is the environment of those of gross and
unrestrained passions, since it and most of the matter of
their astral bodies is of the same type, and it constitutes a
very hell, and the only hell which exi~ts. This is
Auichi, the place of desires which cannot be satisfied
because of the absence of the physical body, which was
the means of their satisfaction. The tortures of these
desires are the analogue of the torments of hell-fire in the
older Christian orthodoxy. Unlike that orthodoxy, how-
ever, theosophy teaches that the state of torment is not
eternal, but p;a.sscs away in time when the desires through
long gnawing without fulfilment, have died at last, and it
is therefore more correct to look on A l'ichi as a purgatorial
state. The ordinary man, however, does not experience
this seventh division of the Astl·aJ Wm'id, but according
to his character finds himself in one or other of the three
next higher divisions. The sixth dh;sion is very little
different !rom his physical existence, and he continues
in his old surroundmgs among his old friends, who are,
of course, unaware of his presence, and indeed, often does
not realise that he is dead so far as the physical world is
concerned. The fifth and fourth divisions are in most
respects quite similar to this, but their inhabitants become
Jess and less immersed in the activities and interests which
"'lave hitherto engrossed them, and each sheath of their
astral bodies decays in turn as did the gross outer sheath
of the scnsu:~list's body. The three higher divisions are
still more removed from the ordinary material world, and
their inhabitants enjoy a state of bliss of which we can have
no conception ; worries and cares of earth are altogether
absent, the insistence of lower desires bas worn out in the
lower divisions, and it is now poc;sible to live continually
in an environment of the loftiest thoughts and aspirations.
The thir · division is said to correspond to the spiritual-
istic "summerlanrl," where the inhabitants live in a world
of their own creation-of the creation of their thoughts.
Its cities and all their contents, scenery of life, are all
formed by the infiuence of thought. The second division
is what is properly looked on as heaven, and the inhabi-
tants of different races, creeds, and beliefs, find it each
according to his belief. Hence, instead of its being the
place taught of by any particular religion, it is the region
where each and every religion finds its own ideal. Christ·
ians, Mohammedans, Hindus, and so on, find it to be just
as they conceived it would be. Here, and in the first and
highest division, the inhabitants pursue noble aims freed
from what of selfishness was mingled with these aims on
earth. The literary man, his thoughts of fame : the artist,
the scholar, the preacher, all work without incentive of
personal interest, and where their work is pursued long
enough, and they are fitted for the change, they leave the
Astral World and enter one vastly higher- the .Mental.
It was, however, mentioned that the rearrangement of the
matter of the astral body at physical death, was the result
of ignorance, and those who are sufficiently instructed do
not permit this rearrangement to take. They are not,
therefore, confined to any one division, and have not to
progress from division to division, but are able to move
through any part ol the .4stral World, labouring always in
their various lines of action to assist the great evolutionary
scheme. (See Astral Body, Worlds, Planes or Spheres,
Theosophy, Avlehl, Summerland.)
Astrology : The art of divining the fate or future of persons
from the juxtaposition of the sun, moon and planets.
Judicial astrology foretells the destinies of individuals and
nations, while ~zalural astro!ogy predict~ changes of weather
and the operation of the stars upon natural things.
History.-In Egyptian tradition, we find its invention
attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, or Thotb, by whom,
under different names, is represented the various revela-
tions of truth, both theological and natural : for he is the
Mercury of the Romans, the eloquent deliverer of the
messages of the gods. The name of Ptolemy. the greatest
of which a$trology can boast, belongs also to Egypt, but
to the comparative:y recent period when Imperial Rome
flourished. In Impenal Rome tUirology was held in great
repute, especially under the reign of Tiberius, who himself
obtained that knowledge of the science from Thrasyllus,
which enabled him to foretell the destiny of Galba, then
consul. When Claudius was d)·ing from the effects of
Locusta s poison, Agrippina cautiously dissembled his
progressive illness; nor would sbe announce his decease
till the very moment arrived, which the astrologers had
pronounced fortunate for the accession of ~ero. Augustus
had discouraged the practice of as!rology by banishing its
professors from Rome, but the favour of his successors
recalled them, and tltough occasional edicts, in subsequent
reigns, restrained, and even punished all who divined
by the stars : and though Vitellius and Domitian revived
the edict of Augustus, the practices of the astrologer3 were
secretly encouraged, and their predictions extensively
believed. Domitian himself, in spite of his hostility, was
in fear of their denouncements. They prophesied the
year, the hour, and the manner of his death, and agreed
with his father in foretelling that he should perish not by
poison. but by the dagger.
After the age of the Antonines and the work of Censorious,
we hear little of astrology for some generations. In the
eighth century tbe venerable Bede and his distinguished
scholar, Alcuin, are said to have pursued this mystic study.
In that immediately following, the Arabians revived and
encouraged it. Under the patronage of Almaimon. the
111irammolin, in the year 827, the Megale Syntaxis of
Ptolemy was translated under the title of "Almagest;•
by AI. Hazen Ben Yusscph. Albumasar added to this
work, and the astral science continued to receive new force
Astrology
from the labours 01 Al!raganus, Ebennozophim, Alfaragius,
and Geber.
The conquest of Spain by the ::\1oors carried this know-
ledge, with all their other treasures of learning into Spain,
and before their cruel expulsion it was naturalized among
the Christian savants. Among these the wise Alonzo
(or Alphonso) of Castile, bas immortalized himself by his
scientific researches, and the Jewish and Christian doctors,
who arranged the tables which pass under his name, were
convened from all the accessible parts of civilized Europe.
Five years were employed in their discussion, and it Las
been said that the enormous sum of 400,000 ducats was
jisbursed in the towers of the Alcazar of Galiana, in the
adjustment and correction of Ptolemy's calculations.
Kor was it only the physical motions of the stars which
occupied this grave :\SSembly. The two kabalistic volumes,
yet existing in cipher, in the royal library of the kings of
Spain, and which tradition assigns to the hand of Alonzo
himself, betoken a more visionary study. and in spite o!
the denunci<!.tiOns against his orthodoxy, which were
thundered in his cars on the authority of Tertullian, Basil
and Bonaventure, the fearless monarch gave his sanction
to such masters as practised truly the art of divination
by the stars, and in one part of his code enrolled astrology
among the seven liberal sciences.
In Germany many eminent men have been addicted
to this study ; and a long catalogue might be made of
those who have considered other sciences with reference
to astrology, and written on them as such. Faust has, of
course, the credit of being an astrologer as well as a wizard,
and we find that singular but splendid genius, Cornelius
Agrippa, writing with as much z;eal against astrology as
on behalf of other occult sciences.
To the believers in astrology, who flourished in the
si"teenth and seventeenth centuries, must be added the
name of Albert von Wallenstein, Duke of Friedland. He
was indeed an enthusiast in the cause, and many curious
anecdotes are related of this devotion. That he bad
himself studied astrology, and under no mean instructors,
is evidenced by his biography ahd correspondence.
Of the early progress of astrology in England, little is
known. Bede and Alcuin we have already mentioned
as addicted to its study. Roger Bacon could scarcely
escape the contagion of the art. But it was the period
ef the Stuarts which must be c.:>nsidered as the acme of
astrology among us. Tl.en Lilly employed the doctrine
of the magical circle, and the evocation of spirits !rom the
Ars Notoria of Cornelius Agrippa, and used the form of
prayer prescribed therein to the angel Salmonceus, and
entertained among his familiar acquaintance the guardian
spirits of Engl:tnd, Salmael and Malchidael. His ill
success with the divining rod induced him to surrender
the pursuit of rhabdomancy, in which be first engaged,
though he still perscrvcd in assertin~ that the operation
demanded secrecy and intelligence m the agents, and,
above all, a strong faith, and a competent knowledge of
their work. The Dean of Westminster had given him
permission to search for treasure in the cloisters of the
abbey in the dead of the night. On the· western side,
the rods turned over each other with inconceiyable rapidity,
yet, on digging, nothing but a coffin c >uld be discovered.
He retired to the abbey, and then a storm arose which
nearly destroyed the west end of the church, extinguished
all the candles but one, and made the rods immovable.
Lilly succeeded at length in charming away the demon,
but no persuasion could induce him to make another
experiment in that seocics of divination.
The successor of L1lly was Henry Coley, a tailor, who
had been his amanuensis, and traded in prophecy with
success almost equal to that of his master.
Astrology
While astrology flounshea in England it was in high repute
with its kindred pursuits of magic, necromancy, and al-
chemy, at the court of France. Catherine de Medici her·
self was an adept in the art. At the revolution, which
commenceda ne,vera in this country, astrology declined, and
notwithstanding the labours of Partridge, and tbo<>e of
Ebenezer Sibley, it bas only in recent years recovered its
importance.
Si~ns.-There are twelve signs of the Zodiac, divided
in astrology into " Northern and " Commanding "
(the first six), and " Southern' and " Obeying" (la~t six).
They are as follow :-
Aries, the house of Mars. and exaltation of the sun, or
the first sign of the zodiac, is a vernal, dry, fiery, rnascnline,
cardinal, equinoctial, diurnal, movable, commanding,
eastern, choleric, violent, and quadrupc<lian sign. These
epithets will be presently c.llplaincd. The native, that is,
the ~rson born under its in!luence, is tall of stature, of a
strong but spare make, dry constitution, long face and neck,
thick shoulders, piercing eyes, sandy or red hair, and brown
complexion. In disposition he will be warm, hasty and
passionate. The aspects of the planets may, however,
materially alter these cficcts. This sign rules the head
and face. Among diseases, it produces small-pox, and
epilepsy, apoplexy, headache, hypochondriasis, baldness,
ringworm, and all diseases of the bead and face, paralysis,
fevers, me-asles, and convulsions. It presides over the
following countries: England, France, Germany, Syria,
Switzerland, Poland and Denmark ; and over the cities of
Naples, Capua, Padua, Florence, Verona, Ferrara, Bruns-
wick, Marseilles, Cresarea, and Utrecht. Its colours are
red and white.
Now to explain this terminology, before examining
another sign, there are said to be four triplicities among
the signs, viz. : the earthly triplicity, including Taurus,
Virgo, and Capricorn ; the airy, Wb1ch includes Gemini,
Libra and Aquarius; the fiery, under which arc reckoned
Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius; and the watery, which claims
Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. The signs arc further divided
into diurnal and nocturnal : Aries diurnal, Taurus noctur-
nal, and so on alternately, the diurnal signs being all
masculine, and the nocturnals feminine. The terms tropi-
cal, equinoctial, vema!, etc., nood no comment. Fixed,
common, movable, refer to the weather. Signs which
are named after quadrupeds are, of course, quadrupedal.
Such as are called after human states of occupations as
humane. A person born under a fiery masculine diurnal
sign, is bot in temper, and bold in character. If it be a
quadrupedal sign, he is somewhat like to the animal.after
which the sign is called. Thus in Taurus, the native is
bold and furious ; in Leo, fierce and cruel. Car.-!inal signs
are those occupying the four cardinal points. The first
six from Aries are termed commanding, and the latter si»,
obeying signs. Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces are called
fruitful or prolific; and Gemini, Leo, and Virgo, barren.
Sagittarius, because usually represented as a centaur, is
said to be humane, and productive of humane character
in the former fifteen degrees, but of a savage, brutal and
intractable disposition in the latter.
\'i<·e shall now proceed with the signs. Taurus is cold
and dry, earthly, melancholy, feminine, fixed and noctur-
nal, southern, the night-bouse of Venus. When influential
in a nativity, it usually produces a person with a broad
forehead, thick lips, dark curling hatr, of quality rather
brutal, melancholy, and slow in anger, but when once
enraged, violent, furious, and difficult to be appeased.
The diseases under this si$n are all such as attack the
throat, scrofula, quinsey, 1mposthumes and wens. The
sign rules the neck and throat. Places subject to it are
stables, cowhouses, cellars and low rooms, and all places
Astrology
used for or by cattle. Of kingdoms, Russta, Irelan<l,
Sweden, Persia and Parthia, and of cities, Leipsic, Parma,
Mantua, Novogorod, and eleven others.
Gemini is masculine and diurnal. aerial. hot and moist.
The native is tall, and straight of body, v..;th long arm~ ;
the hands and feet well formed, the complexion rather
dark, the hair brown, the eye hazel ; strong and active in
person, sound and acute in judgment; lively, playful,
and generally skilful in business. Diseases under this sign
are those to which the arms, hands and shoulders are
subject, with aneurisms, frenzy and insanity. Places :
hilly and high grounds, the tops of houses, wai!ISCOted
rooms, ha!Js and theatres, barns, storehouses and <>tairs ;
kingdoms, Armenia, Brabant, Lombardy, Sardinia and
Egypt; cities : London, Bruges, Cordova, Metz and seven
others. It is the day-house of Mercury, and rules the
colours red and white.
Cancer is the only house of the moon, and the first
sign of the watery northern triplicity. It is a watery,
cold, moist, phlegmatic, feminine, movable nocturnal, sol-
stitial, and exceedingly fruitful sign, more so than any
other. TJte native is fair and pale, short and small ; the
upper part of the body larger in proportion to the lower ;
a round face, light hair, and blue or grey eyes ; phlegmatic,
and heavy in disposition ; weak in constitution, and of a
small voice. Diseases : All disorders of the breast and
stomach over which parts the sign rules ; cancers, con-
sumption, asthma, dropsy and surfeits. Kingdoms:
Scotland, Holland, Zealand, Burgundy, Numidia and
Carthage ; places : the sea and all rivers, swamps, ponds,
lakes, wells, ditches, and watery places. Cities: Constanti-
nople, Tunis, York and New York, Genoa, VenicP., Algiers,
Amsterdam, Cadiz, and sixteen others. The colours ruled
by this sign are green and russet.
Leo is a sign of a very different nature. It is the only
house of the sun : fiery, hot, dry, masculine, choleric, com-
manding, eastern, and a very barren sign. ·when this
sign ascends in a nativity, the individual will be of a tall
and powerful frame, well-shaped, of an austere countenance,
of light, yellowish hair, large piercing eyes, commanding
aspect, and ruddy complexion. The character will be
fierce and cruel, but yet open, generous and Courteous.
Such was Richard Creur-de·Lion. But the latter part of
the sign is weaker and more brutal. This sign is even more
modified by planetary influences than any others. Among
diseases it causes all affections of the heart, over which
together with the back and the verteb~ of the neck, it
rules ; fevers, plague, jaundice and pleurisy. Of places,
it governs woods, forests, deserts and hunting-grounds, fire-
places and furnaces; of kingdoms: Italy, Chald<ea, Turkey
and Rohemia; of cities: Bath, Bristol, Taunton, Rome,
Damascus. Prague, Philadt>lphia, and nineteen others.
Its colours are red and green.
Virgo is an earthy, cold, dry, barren, feminine, southern,
melancholy, commanding sign. It is the house and
exaltation of Mercury. The native is handsome and well-
shaped, slender, of middle stature, and of a clear, ruddy
or brown complexion, dark hair and eyes, the face rather
round, and the voice sweet and clear, but not strong ; the
character amiable and benevolent, witty and studious,
but not persevering ; and if not opposed by planetary
aspects, apt to oratory. This sign rules the viscera, and
is answerable for all diseases affecting them. Of places :
cornfieldsand granaries, studies and libraries ; of kingdoms:
Greece, Crete, Mesopotamia and Assyria ; of cities :
Jerusalem, Paris, Corinth, and twelve others. Its colours
are blue and black.
Libra is a sign aerial, sanguine, hot, moist, equinoctial

rather above the middle stature, with fine chestnut hair,
but inclined to baldness, a visage somewhat long but ruddy
and handsome ; the body strong, stout and hardy. He is
inclined to horsemanship and field-sports, careless of
danger, generous and intrepid, but hasty and carelt>ss.
This sign rules the hips, and is the cause of gout, rheu-
matism and disorders which affect the muscles. Accidents
and disorders occasioned by intemperance come under
the government of this sign. Of kingdoms: Spain, Hun-
gary, Sclavonia and Arabia; of places: stables and parks;
and of colours, green and red.
Capricornus is an earthy, cold, dry, feminine, nocturnal,

es such as hypochondriasis
and hysteria. The kingdoms which it rules are India,
Thrace, Mexico and Saxony ; and the cities, Oxford,
Bradenburg and nineteen others. The places over which ·

lia and Normandy ; of cities : Composteila, Alexandria.
Rheims. Ratisbon, and eleven others; and of colours, it
rules white.
Plan~ts. The influence and effects of the planets are
still more important than those of the signs, and they arE:
as follow: We commence v.'ith the most remote of the
planets, Uranus. The days and hours are, as we have seen
divided among the planets, but as none were left vacant,
the appropriation of any to Uranus would, of course, throw
out almost all the ancient calculations. ll these then are
to be preserved, the newly-discovered planet has no in-
fluence ; but if this be the case, by what analogy can any be
assigned to the others ? However, when this question was
likely to be debated, Uranus was rolling on in its far-off
orbit, and occasioning no uneasiness w'hatever to astro-
logers or magicians. Leaving out all mention of the
astronomical elements, we proceed to notice that Uranus
is by nature extremelv cold and dry, melancholy, and one
of the infortunes. The native is of small stature, dark or
pale complexion, rather light hair, of a highly nervous
temperament, sedate aspect, but havin~ something singular
in his appearance ; light grey eyes, and delicate constitu-
tion. If the planet be well dignified, he is a searcher into
science, particularly chemistry, and remarkably attached
to the wonderful He possesses an extraordinary magnani-
mity and loftiness of mind, with an uncontrollable and
intense desire for pursuits and discoveries of an uncommon
nature. II ill-dignified, then the native is weak, sickly,
and short-lived, treacherous, and given to gross imposture,
unfortunate in his undertakings. capricious in his tastes,
and very eccentric in his conduct. No planet, save Saturn,
is so actively and powerfully malevolent as this. His
effects arc truly malc6c. They are, however of a totally
unexpected, strange and unaccountable character. He
rules over places dedicated to unlawful arts, laboratories,
etc. The regians under his immediate governance are
Lapland. Finland, and the Poles. Professions: necro-
mancers and Geetic magicians; cities: Upsala and :Mexico.
The name of his angel has not been found out, but be is
known to be very hostile to the female sex, and when his
aspec-ts interfere in the period of marriage, the result is
anything but happiness.
Saturn is by nature cold and dry; is a melancholy,
earthy, masculine, solitary, diurnal. malevolent planet,
and the great infortune. When he is lord of the ascendant,
the native is of a middle stature, the complexion dark
and swarthy, or pale'; small black eyes, broad shouklers,
black hair, and ill-shaped about the lower extremi:ties.
When well dignified, the native is grave and v.'ise, studious
and severe, of an active and penetrating mind, reserved
and patient, constant in attachment, but implacable in
resentment, upright and inflexible ; but if the planet be
ill-dignified at the time of birth, then the native will be
sluggish, covetous, and distrustful; false, stubborn,
malicious, and ever discontented. This planet is said to be
well dignified in the horoscope of the Duke of Wellington,
and to have been ill-dignified, but singularly posited in
that of Louis XI. of France. The diseases he signifies are
quartan agues, and such as proceed from cold and melan-
choly ; aU impediments in the sight, ear, and teeth ;
rheumatism, consumption, disorders affecting the memory,
the spleen, and the bones. Saturn, in general, signifies
husbandmen, day-labourers, monks, Jesuits, sectarians,
sextons, and such as have to do mth the dead ; gardeners,
dyers of black, and thirty-three other professions, which
Lilly enumerates. He mentions also forty-eight plants,
Astrology
including all anodynes and narcotic poisons, which are
under the rule of this planet. Among animals, the cat,
the ass, hare, mole, mouse, wolf, bear, and crocodile; all
venomous creatures. Among fishes, the eel, tortoise and
shell-fish ; among the birds, the bat, and the owl ; among
metals and minerals, lead, the loadstone, and all dross of
metals ; over the sapphire, lapis lazuli, and all stones that
are not polishable, and of a leaden or ashy colour.
" He causeth the air to be dark &nd cloudy, cold and
hurtful, with thick and dense vapours. He delighteth in
the eastern quarter, causing eastern winds; and in gather-
ing any plant belonging to him the ancients did observe to
turn their faces to the east in his hour. Those under him
do rarely live beyond fifty-seven years ; and if he be well
placed, seldom less than thirty. But his nature is cold
and dry, and these qualities are destructive to man. Black
is the colour which he ruleth. Of countries under his
influence are Bavaria, Sa..xony, and Styria ; Ravenna,
Constance and Ingoldstadt among cities. His friends are
Jupiter, Mars and Mercury; his enemies, the Sun and
Venus. We call Saturday his day, for then he begins to
rule at sunrise, and rules the first hour and the eighth of
that day. His angel is Cassel."
The next planet is Jupiter. He is a diurnal, masculine
planet, temperately hot and moist, airy, and sanguine;
the greater fortune and lord of the airy triplicity. The
native, if the planet be well dignified, will be of an erect
carriage and tall stature ; a handsome ruddy complexion,
high forehead, soft, thick brown hair; a handsome shape
and commanding aspect ; his voice will be strong, clear
and manly, and his speech grave and sober. If the planet
be ill dignified, still the native \\'ill be what is called a good-
looking person, though of smaller stature, and less noble
aspect. In the former case, the understanding and char-
acter will be of the highest possible description ; and in the
latter case, though careless and improvident, immoral and
irreligious, he will never entirely lose the good opinion of
his friends. Yet he will be, as Sancho Panza expresses it:
" Haughty to the humble, and humble to the haughty."
The diseases it rules are apoplexy and inflammation of the
lungs; disorders affecting the left ear, cramps, and pal-
pitations of the heart. Plants : the oak, spice, apples,
and one hundred and seventy-two others ; gems : topaz,
amethyst, hyacinth and bezoar ; minerals : tin, pewter
and firestone ; animals : the ox, horse, elephant, stag,
and all domestic animals; weather : pleasant, healthful,
and serene west-north and north-west winds ; birds : the
eagle, peacock, pheasant, etc. Of fishes, he rules the
whale and the dolphin ; of colours :' blue, when well
posited; of professions: the clergy, the hi.gher order of
law students, and those who deal in woollen goods ; when
weak, the dependents on the above, with quack3, common
cheats, and drunkards. Places: all churches, palaces,
courts, and places of pomp and solemnity. He rules the
lungs and blood, and is friendly mth all the planets, save
Mars. Countries: Spain, Hungary and Babylon ; his
angel is Zadk.iel.
The next planet is Mars ; a masculine, nocturnal, hot,
and dry planet; of the fiery triplicity; the author of
strife, and the lesser infortune. The native is short, but
strongly made, having large bones, ruddy complexion, red
or sandy hair and eyebrows, quick, sharp eyes, round,
bold face, and fearless aspect. If well dignified, courageous
and invincible, unsusceptible of fear, careless of life, reso-
lute and uosubmissivc. If ill dignified, a trumpeter of
his own fame, ~·ithout decency or honesty; fond of quarrels,
prone to fightings, and given up to every species of fraud,
violence and oppression. Nero was an example of this
planet's influence, and the gallows is said to terminate
most generally the career of those born in low life under
Astrology 46
its government. This plant rules the head, face, gall,
left ear, and the smell. Disease ; plague, fevers. and all
complaints arising from excessive heat ; all wounds by
iron or steel, injuries by poison, and all evil effects from
intemperate anger. Herbs and plants: mustard, radish,
with all pungent and thorny plants ; gems . the bloodstone,
jasper, ruby and garnet; of minerals. iron, arsenic,
antimony, sulphur and vermilion; animals. the mastiff
wolf. tiger and all savage beasts; birds. the hawk, kite,
raven, vulture, and generally birds of prey; weather:
thunder and lightning, fiery meteors, and all stran~e pheno-
mena; kingdoms: Lombardy and Bavaria; citie~:
Jerusalem and Rome. He signifies soldiers, surgeons,
barbers and butchers. Places: smiths' shops, slaughter-
ho!lses, fields of battle, and brick-kilns. His friends are
all the planets, save the Moon and Jupiter. His colour is
red, and his angel is Samael.
We now come to the ,Sun, a masculine hot ana dry
planet. of favourable effects. The native is very like one
born under Jupiter, but the hair is lighter, the complexion
redder. the body fatter, and the eyes larger. ·when well
dignified, the solar man is affable, courteous, sple-ndid
and sumptuous, proud, liberal, humane, and ambitious.
When ill dignified, the native is arrogant, mean, loquacious,
and sycophantic ; much resembling the native under
Jupiter, i11 dignified, but still worse. Disease<;: all those
of the heart, mouth am\ throat; epilepsy, scrofula,_tym-
paniti~. and brain -fevers. Herbs and plants: laurel,
vervain, St. John's wort, orange, hyacinth, and some
hundreds beside ; gem:; : carbuncle, the diamond, the
:etites ; minerals : gold ; animals : the lion, the boar, the
horse ; birds : the lark, the swan, the nightingale, and all
singing birds ; fish : the star-fish and all shell-fish ; coun-
tries : Italy, Bohemia, Chaldrea and Sicily ; of cities:
Rome ; colour yellow ; weather, that which is most
seasonable ; professions : king-;, lords and all dignified
persons, braziers, ~oldsrniths, and persons employed in
mints ; places : ktngs' courts, palaces, theatres, halls,
and places of state. His friends .are all the planets, save
Saturn ; and his angel is Michael.
The influence of the asteroids, Juno, Pallas, Ceres, and
Vesta, have never been calculated. and they are said by
modem astrologers to act beneficially, but feebly.
The Moon is a far more important planet ; feminine,
nocturnal, cold, moist, and phlegmatic. Her influence
in itself is neither fortunate nor unfortunate. She is
benevolent or otherwise, according to the aspects of other
planets towards her ; and under these circumstances she
becomes more pdlverful than any of them. The native is
short and stout, with fair, pale complexion, r:>und face,
grey eyes, short arms, thick hands and feet, very hairy,
but with light hair; phlegmatic. If the Moon be affected
by the Sun at the time of birth, the native will have a
blemish on or near the eye. When the ll'loon is well
dignified the native is of soft, engaging manners, imagina-
tive, and a lover of the arts, but wandering, careless,
timorous, and unstable, loving peace, and averse from
activity. When ill dignified, then the native will be of an
ill shape, indolent, worthless and disorderly. Diseases :
palsy, epilepsy, scrofula and lunacy, together with all
diseases of the eyes; herbs: lily, poppies, mushrooms,
willow, and about two hundred others; minerals and gems;
pearls, selenite, silver and soft stones ; colour, white ;
animals: the dog, the cat, the otter, the mcuse, and all
amphibious creatures; birds: the goose, duck, bat and
waterfowl in general ; fish : the eel, the crab, and the
lobster ; weather : she increases the effect of other planets ;
countries : Denmark, Holland, Flanders, and North
America; cities : Amsterdam, Venice, Bergen-op-Zoon,
and Lubeck; places : fountains, baths, the sea, and in
.Astrolo~
watery places: professions: queens and dignih!!d women
midwives, nurses, all who have to do with water,
sailors. Her angel is Gabriel.
Venus is a feminine planet, temperately cold and moist,
the author of mirth and sport. The native is handsome,
well-formed, but not tall; clear complexion, bright hazel or
black eyes, dark brown or chestnut hair, thick, soft, and
shining ; the voice soft and sweet, and the aspect very
prepossessing. If well digojjjed, the native will be cheerful,
friendly, musical, and fond of elegant accomplishments;
prone to love, but frequently jealous. If ill dignified, the
native is less handsome in person and in mind, altogether
vicious, given up to every licentiousness ; ri.ishonest and
atheistical. Herbs and plants : the fig-tree, myrrh,
myrtle, pomegranate, and about two hundred and twenty
more ; animals: the goat, panther, hart, etc. ; birds :
the sparrow, the dove, the thrush, and the wren ; gems :
the emerald, chrysolite, beryl, thrysoprasus; countries:
Spain, India and Persia ; citieo;: Florence, Paris and
Vienna ; mineral : copper; colour : green ; occupations :
all such as minister to pomp and pleasure; weather:
warm, and accompanied with showers. Her angel is
Banaei.
Mercury is the last of the planets which we .nave to
consider. He is ma~cullne, melancholy, cold, and dry.
The native ts tall, straight, and thin, with a narrow face-
and high forehead, long straight nose, eyes black or grey,
thin )Jps and chin, scanty beard, with brown bllir; the
arms, hands and fingers, long and slender : this last is
said to be a peculiar mark of a nativity under Mercury.
If the planet be oriental at the time of birth, the nath·e
will be very likely to be ot a stronger constitution, and with
sandy hair. If occidental, sallow, lank, slender, and of a
dry habit. \'lhen well dignified, he will be of an acute and
penetrating mind, of a powerful imagination, and a retentive
memory ; eloquent, fond of learning, and successful- in
scientific investigation. If engaged in mercantile pursuits,
enterprising and skilful. If ill dignified, then the nati\'e·
is a mean. unprincipled character, pretending to knowled~e.
but an imposter. and a slanderer, boastful, malicious. and
addicted to theft. Diseases : all that affect the brain.
head, and intellectual faculties ; herbs and plants: the·
walnut, the valerian, the trefoil, and about one hundred
more ; animals : the dog, the ape, the weasel, and the fox ;
weather: rain, hailstones, thunder and lightning, parti-
c}.llarly in the north ; occupations: all literate and learned
professions; when ill dignified, all pretenders, quacks,
and mountebanks. Places : schools, colleges, markets,
'va.rehouses, exchanges, all placesof commerce and learning ;
metal, quicksilver; gems: cornelian, sardonyx, opal, onyx,
and chalcedony; his colour is purple. His friends are
Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn; his enemies }Iars, the Suo,
and the Moon. His angel is Raphael.
The Aspects of the Planets are five, thus distinguished:
1. Conjunction, when two plan'ets are in the same degree
and minute of a sign, which may be of good or evil
import, according to the nature of the planets, and
their relation to each other as friendly or the contrary.
2. Sectile, when two planets are 6o0
distant from each
other, it is called the aspect of imperfect love or friendship,
and is generally a favourable omen. 3· Quartile, when
two planets are 90° distant from each other, making the
aspect of imperiect hatred, and inclining to enmity and
misfortune. 4· Trine, when the distance is 120°, promis·
ing the most perfect unanimity and peace. 5· Opposition,
when two planets are 180° apart, or exactly opposite each
other, which is considered an aspect of perfect hatred, and
implies every kind of misfortune.
The Planets are said to be in their joys when situated in
the houses where they are most strong and powerful, thus :

the Sun in. Leo, Venus m Taurus, Mercury in Virgo, and
the Moon 1D Cancer. Cogent reasons are given why the
planets should joy in these houses rather than others.
The Dragon's lleod and Drago,.'s Tail are the points,
called nodes, in which the ecliptic is intersected by the
orbits of the planets, particularly by that of the moon.
These points are, of course, shifting. The Draqon's Head
is the point where the moon or other planet commences its
northward latitude ; it is considered masculine and bene-
volent in its influence. The Dragon's Tr1il is fte point
where the planets' southward progress begins ; it is femi-
nine and malevolent.
The Part of Fortune is the distance of the moon's place
from the sun, added to the degrees of the ascendent.
The Twelve Planetary Houses are determined by drawing
certain great circles through the intersection of the horizon
and meridian, by which the whole globe or sphere is ap-
portioned into twelve equal parts. In practice these lines
arc projected by a very simple method on a plane. The
space in the centre of the figure thus described may be
supposed to represent the situation of the earth, and is
generally used to write down the exact time when the
figure was erected, and for whose nativity, or for what
question. Each division or house rules certain events
in this order, reckoned from the cast: 1, life or person ; 2,
riches; 3, brethren or kindred ; 4, parents; 5, children;
6, servants and sickness; 7. marriage ; 8, death ; 9,
religion; IO, magistracy ; r I, friends; 12, enemies.
These categories arc made to comprehend all that can
possibly befall any individual, and the prognostication is
drawn from the configuration of the planets in one or
more of these " houses."
The Horoscope denotes the configuration of the planets
in the twelve houses ascertained for the moment of nativity,
or the hour of the question. The Ascendent (a term
sometimes used instead of horoscope) is the planet rising
in the east or first bouse, which marks the general character
of the child then born. Hyleg is another term for the
lord of life ; Anareta for the destroyer of life, which are
considered the chief places in a horoscope.
The Clzamcters used in astrology, to denote the twelve
signs, the planets, etc., are as follows :

These characters represent natural object.q, but tl1ey
have also a hieroglyphic or e'Soteric meaning that has been
lost. The figure of Aries represents the head and horns
of a ram ; that o£ Taurus, the head and horns of a bull ;
that of Leo, the head and mane of a lion; that of Gemini,
two persons standing together, and so of the rest. The
physical or astronomical reasons for the adoption of these
figures have been explained with great lcarnin.f? by the
Abbe Pluche, in his Histoire d11 Citl. and Dupws, in his
Alwigi de l'Origine de tous les Culles, has endeavoured to
establish the principles of an astro·mythology, by tracing
the progress of the moon through the tw~lve sign~. in a
series of adventures, which he compares with the wander-
ings of Isis. This kind of reasoning is suggestive, cer-
tainly, but it only establishes analogies. and proves nothing.
Nat·ivities.-The cases in which astrological predictions
were chiefly sought, were in Nativities; that is in ascer-
taining the fate and fortunes of any individual from the
positions of the stars at the time of his birth ; and in
questions called horary, which comprehended almost every
matter which might be the subject of astrological inquiry.
The event of sickness, the success of any undertaking,
the reception ofany suit. were all objects of horary questions.
A person was said to be born under that planet
which ruled the hour of his birth. Thus two hours every
day are under the control of Saturn. The first hour after
sunrise on Saturday is one of them. A person therefore
born on Saturday in the first hour after sunrise, bas Saturn
for the lord of his ascendant ; those born in the next hour,
Jupiter; and so on in order. Venus rules the first hour
on Friday; Mercury on Wednesday Jupiter on Thursday,
the sun and moon on Sunday and Monday, and Mars on
Tuesday. The next thing is to make a figure divided into
twelve portions, which are called houses, as directed above.
The twelve houses arc equal to the twelve signs, and the
planets, being always in the zodiac, will therefore all fall
within these tw!o'lve divisions or houses. The line, which
separates any house from the preceding, is called the cusp
of the bouse. The first house is called the ascendant,
and the east angle ; the fourth the imum cceli, or the north
angle ; the seventh, the west angle ; and the tenth, the
medium cceli, or the south angle. Having drawn this
figure, tables and directionl: are given for the placing of
the signs, and as one bouse is equal to one sign when one
is given, the rest are given also. When the signs and
Astroloey 48
planets are all placed in the houses, the next thing is to
augur, from their relative position, what influence they
.,.;n have on the life and fortunes of the native.
The House of Life implies all that affects, promotes, or
endanl(ers life. Saturn or Mars in this house denotes a
short or unfortunate life, while Jupiter and Venus have-,
when free from evil aspects, an exactly contrary effect.
The sign ascending will considerably modify the person
and character of the native, so that to form an astrological
judgment of this it will be necessary to combine the indi·
cations of the sign and the planet. In what are called
horary questions, this hou~e relates to all questions of life,
health, and appearance, such as stature, complexion,
shape, accidents and sickness. It shows the events of
journeys and voya~es, with respect to the life and health
of those engaged m them. When the question is of a
political nature, 1t signifies the people in general, and being
of the same nature as Aries, all that is said of that sign
may be transferred to this house. The second house,
which is of the same nature as the sign Taurus, is called
the house of riches. It signifies the advancement in the
world with respect to opulence of the querent; and here
the operations of the planets arc, as in other cases, accord-
ing to their own nature, jup1ter, Venus, Mercury. and the
Sun being fortunate, if well aspected, only denoting different
cause~ of wealth ; Saturn, Mars. the Moon, and Uranus,
unfortunate. In horary questions, it si~nif\cs the money
of the querent, or the success in a pccumary point of view
of any expedition of undertaking. It concerns loans, law-
snits, and everything by which riches may be gained or
lost. In political questions it signifies the treasury, public
loans, taxes, and subsidies ; the younger branches of the
blood-royal, and the death of national enemies. The third
house is the house of kindred, particularly of brothers,
and was probably so designated on account of the third
sign Gemini, of which nature it is said to be. It denotes
kindred, and the planets in this house are full of signifi-
cation. Saturn srgnifies coldness and di-strust ; .Mars,
sudden, violent and hasty quarrels; Herschel, aU un·
accountable estrangements; Jupiter denotes steady
friendships, Venu~ great love between brothers and sisters,
and good fortune by means of the latter ; the Sun, warm
attachment; the l\Ioon. indifference. In horary questions.
this house signifies the health, fortune and happiness of
the :}Uerent's parents, his own patrimony and inheritance,
and the ultimate consequences, either good or bad, of any
undertaking in which he may be engaged. In political
cases it denotes the landed interest of a nation the ancient
and chartered rights of all classes, which have been handed
down to them from their ancestors ; and all public advo-
cates and defenders of these interests and rights.
The fifth house, which has the same government, and
partakes of the same character as Leo, is called the House
of Children. In nativities, therefore, it denotes the children
of the native, and thP.ir success and also his own success by
means of them. It also has ~orne reference to women.
The health and welfare of children, whether present or
absent, arc determinable by the planets in this house.
It also denotes all questions relative to amusement, simply,
as it would seem, on account of the fondness of youth for
such pursuits. In political questions consequently, we
find this house taken to signify the rising r;eneration,
theatres, exhibitions, public festivals, and all national
amusements : all increase in the population; music and
musical taste, sculpture, painting, and the advancement
of the fine arts in general. The sixth house is that of
s-ervants, but it also denotes sickness and private enemies.
It is usually considered an evil house. and but few con-
figurations of the planets which can take place in it are
fortunate. It is of the nature, and shares the government
Astrology
of Virgo. When the lord of the ascendant is placed in this
house, it denotes a low station, and if in addition to this
he be ill dignified, the native will not rise above menial
employments. In horary atlrology it points out servants
and cattle, dependents, and small shopkeepers ; uncles
and auntsby the father sside; tenants, stewards, shepherds
and farmers. If, however, the question be political, then
this house indicates the under-servants of the government ;
the common seamen in the navy, private soldiers in the
army, and the general health of the nation. This last
refers chiefly to contagious and epidemic disorders.
The seventh house, which is of the same nature as Libra,
and bas the same government, is the House of )[arriage.
If Saturn be found here, he denotes unhappiness from
constitutional causes ; Mars from difference of temper ;
Herschel, as usual, from some strange and unaccountable
dislike. The other planets are mostly causers of good,
unless exception be made in the case of the Moon. In
horary questions, this house denotes love, speculations in
business, partners in trade, lawsuits, and litigation ; it is
the House of Thieves, and sets forth thier conduct and
character. In queries of a political nature, it signifies the
event of any war, and the consequences of a treaty; it
personates the victorious nation, army, or navy, alld in-
dicates outlaws and fugitives, with the places in which
they have taken their retreat.
The eighth house is the House of Death. It denotes
wills, legacies, and all property depending upon the death
of others ; the power, means, and influence of adversaries;
the opposing parties in lawsuits. It is of the nature of
Scorpio, and has the same government. If Mars be un-
fortunately placed in this house, it portends a violent
death to the native. Saturn is often productive of suicide,
and Herschel of the mysterious disappearance of -the un-
happy individual, whose horoscope is so marked. Jupiter,
on the contrary, and Venus, point out a late and quiet
departure. In horary questions its significance has been
already noticed, but it also denotes the portion or dowry
of women, and seconds in duels. In political questions it
has a signification of a very different character, viz., the
rrivy council of a king or queen, their friends, and secrets
of state. lt does, however, bear some mark of its appro-
priation to death, by being made to denote the rate of
mortality among the people. The ninth house is that of
religion, science, and learning. It has the same govern-
ment and nature as Sagittarius. Jupiter is the most
fortunate planet in it. and if joined "-ith Mercury, then the
native is promised a character at once learned, estimable,
and truly religious. The Sun and Venus arc likewise good
signlficators here, but the l\Ioon denotes a changeable mind,
and frequent alterations in religious principles. l\Iars is
the worst planet in this house, and portends an indifference,
or even an active hostility to religion. In hor.try questions
the ninth house is appropriated to the church and the
clergy ; all ecclesiastical matters, dissent, heresy, schism,
dreams, visions, and religious delusions. It also denotes
voyages and travels to distant lands, and in qucstio!ls of
a political nature, the religion of the nation, and all the higher
and more solemn courts or justice, such as Chancery, etc.
The tenth house is one of the most important of all.
It is the Houre of Honour, Rank, and Dignity ; _of the
nature and rule of Capricorn. In this house the planets
are more powerful than in any other, save only the House
of Life. They point out the employment, success, pre-
ferment, and authority of the native. Saturn is here the
worst planet, but the Moon and Herschel are also mis-
chievous, the latter by preventing the native from attaining
that rank to which his services, learning, or merit entitle
him, and doing this by a series o£ inexplicable disappoint-
ments. Jupiter and the Sun signify advancement by the
Astrology 49 Atlantis
favour o! distinguished men, and Venus, of distinguished
women. In horary questions, the tenth house signifies the
mother of the querist : and politically the sovereign. This
is a house in which Mars is not unfortunate, if well placed:
denoting war-like achievements and consequent honours.
The eleventh house is the House of Friends : it is of the
nature of Aquarius, and has the same rule. It denotes, of
course, friends, well-wishers, favourites, and flatterers,
but is said to be a house in which evil planets are increased
in strength, and good planets diminished. The Sun is
the best planet in it, and Mars the worst. In horary
question'> it has the same signification as in a nativity, a.nd
also denotes the expectations and wishes of the querist.
It is said to be much influenced by the sign which is in it,
aJld t(. signify legacies, if the sign be one of the earthy
triplicity, and honour with princes, if it be one of the fiery
triplicity. In political questions, the eleventh house
signifies the allies of the public, with whom no particular
treaty is at the same time binding ; and also the general
council of the nation, and newly acquired rights.
Lastly, the twelfth house, which, of course, partakes
the rule and character of Pisces, is the House of Enemies,
and denotes sorrow, sickness, care, anxiety, and all kinds
of sul1ering. Yet evil planets are weaker, according to
some writers, and good planets stronger than in certain
other houses. Very few configurations in this house are
esteemed for the native, but its evil effects are, of course,
greatly modified by the planetary influences. In horary
questions it signifies imprisonment, treason, sedition,
assassination, and suicide ; and in questions which are of
a political character, it points out deceit:Cul treaties, un-
successful negotiations, treachery in the offices of state,
captivity to princes, and general ill furtune. The criminal
code, and the punishment of culprits, dungeons, and cir-
cumstances connected with prison discipline are also
denoted by this house. Saturn is the worst, and Venus the
best planet to be present in it.
Having taken noticc·of the signs, the planets, and the
houses, it is next necessary for the astrologer to note also
the aspects of the planets one towards another, which
aspects decide whether the planet is of good or evil signifi-
cation. These aspects are as follows-omitting the less
important:
1. The Trine, marked A. when two planets are four
signs, or I2o0
apart. ~
2. The Sectile, marked * when two planets are two
signs, or 60° apart.
J. The Quintile, (5·tile) when two planets are .. 72°
apart.
These are all fortunate aspects, and are here placed
according to their importance.
4. The Conjunction, d when two stars or planetsare
of the same sign.
This is a fortunate aspect with the fortunate, and evil
with evil planets.
5, The Opposition, -f) when two planetsaresixsigns
or I8o0
apart. V'-'
6. The Quartile, 0 when two planets are three signs
or go• apart.
7· The Semi·quartilc ;!0 when the two planets arc
45° apart.
These three last aspects arc evil, and evil in the order
in which they are here placed.
H orary questions are subjects of astrological calculations.
They are so called, because the scheme of the heavens is
erected for the hour in which the question is put. Thus,
let a person be sick, and the question be of h1s recovery,
the Houses will now signify as follows, says Blagrave :-
.. I. The patient's person
2. His estate
J. His kindred
4· His father or rus grave
5· His children
6. His sickness and servants
7· His wife and his physician
8. His death
9· His rf"ligion
IO. His mother and his physic
I I. His friends
12. His enemies."
And according to the position of the planets the above
particulars are to be judged of. If the question be of
stolen goods, a distribution of the houses is again made
according to similar rules. And here the colour denoted
by the signs is pertinent ; for let Mercury signify the thief,
then the sign in which that planet is found will denote
the personal appearance and complexion of the thief. If
the question be one concernin~ marriage, then it points out
that of the future bride or bndegroom ; and so on.

Atlantis : a supposed sunken continent. which according
to some account~. occupied most of the area of the present
Atlantic Ocean. It is dealt with here because of late years
several accounts purporting to come from certain spirit
"controls" bave been published which give a more or less
detailed description of the history, life and manners of its
inhabitants, and it is of interest to Theosophists. The ques-
tion regarding the existence of such a continent i~ a very
vexed one indeed. It appears to have originated at an early
date, for Plato in his Timams states that the Atlantians
overran Europe and were only repulsed by the Greeks. It
is stated that the Hindu priesthood believed. and still be·
lieve that it once existed ; and there are shadowy legends
among the American native races which would seem to
assist these beliefs. At the Fame time definite proof is
conspicuous by its absence. Brasseur de Bourbourg held
that A aa,tis was an extension of America wruch stretched
from Central America and Mexico, far into the Atlantic,
the Canaries, Madeiras and Azores being the only remnants
which were not submerged ; and many similar fantastic
theories have been advanced. Donnelly undertook to

well as the head, when it is called at4reola. It is also
thought that the colours of the body and clothing in
mcdi<Eval p.Untings and stained glass are intended to
represent the auric colours of the person portrayed. The
crowns and distinctive head-dresses worn by the kings and
priests of antiquity. are said to be symbolic of the aura.
In many of the sacred books of the Eal::t, representations
of the great teachers and holy men are given with the
light extending round the whole of the body. Instances
of this may be found in the temple caves of bdia and
Ceylon. in the Japanese Buddhistic book!', aho in Egypt,
Greece, Mexico and Peru. In occult literature the tradition
of the aura is an old one, Paracelsus, in the t6tb century,
making mention of it in the following terms : •· The vital
force is not enclosed in man. but radiates round him like a
luminous sphere, and it may be made to act at a distance.
In these semi-natural rays the imagination of man may
produce healthy or morbid c:ffects. It may poison the
essence of life and cause diseases or it may purify it after
it has been made impure, and restore the health." Again :
·· Our thoughts are simply magnetic emanations, which,
m escaping from our brains, pepetrate into kindred heads
and carry thither, with a reflection of our life, the mirage
of our secrets." A modern theosophical description is as
follows : " The aura is a highly complicated and entangled
manifestation, consi~ting ot many influences operating
within the same area. Some of the elements romposing
the at4ra are projected ftom the body, others from the
astral principles, and others ag.Un from the more spiritual
principles connected with the .. Higher Self, " or permanent
Ego; and the vario:Js aura.
< a.e not lying ont:> around the

place. G:Jided by occult training the clairvoyant faculty
may make a complete analysis of the various elements
in the aura. and can estimate the delicate tints of which it
is composed-though all blended together-as if each were
St>en separately."
Classified more exactly. the dh·isions of the aura are
stat~d to be: t, the health aura; z, the vital aura; 3,
the " Karmic " a11ra, that of the animal son! in man; 4•
the aura of character ; 5. the aura of the spiritual nature.
The " health aura " is thus described : •· It is almost
coiourless. but becomes perceptibie by rea£on of possessing
a cunous system of radial striation. that is to say. it is
composed of an enormous number of straight lines, radia-
ting evenly in all directions from the body." The second,
or ·• vital " aura, is said to be to a certain extent under
the control of the will, \\:hen it circulates within the" linga
charira " or astral body, of a " delicate rosy tint. which it
Jose", becoming bluish as it radiates outward." The third
at4ra is " the field of manifestation, or the mirror in which
every feeling, every desire is reflected." Of this aura the
colours constantly change, as seen by the clairvoyant
vision. " An outburst of anger 'vill charge the whole
aura with deep red flashes on a dark ground, while s udden
terror will, in a moment. change everything to a ghastly
grey." The fourth aura is that of the permanent chaxacter,
and is said to contain the record of the past earth-life of
the personality. The fifth aum is not often seen even by
clairvoyants, but it is described by those who have seen it,
only in the cases where the spiritual nalure is the most
powerful factor, as " outshining all the rest of the a11ras
with startling brilliancy." The auric colour!', it is declared,
cannot be adequately described in terms of the ordinary
colours discernible to the physical vision, being very much
brighter, and of more varied hu~s and shad~. The sym-
bolic meaning of these is roughly of the following order :
Rose. pure affection ; brilliant red, anger and force ; dirty
red, pa!'Sion and sensuality ; yellow, of the purest lemon
colour, the highest type of intellectual activity ; orange,
intellect used for selfish ends. pride and ambition ; brown,
avarice. Green is a colour of varie'l significance ; its root
meaning is the placing of one's self in the position of
anoth-.:r. In its lower asper.ts it represents dec~'t and
jealousy; higher up in the emotional gamut, it signifies
adaptability, and at its very highest, when it tells on the
co!our of foliage, sympathy, the very essence of thinking
for other people. In some shades green stands for the
lower intellectual and critical faculties, merging into yellow.
Etue indicates r~ligious feeling and devotion. its various
shades being said to corresJ>Ond to different degrees of
devotion, rising from fetish1sm to the loftiest religious
idealism. Purple represents psychic facnlty. spirituality,
regality, spiritual power arising from knowledge, and occult
pre-eminence.

Australia: Naiive Ma!fiG.-From birth to death, the
native Australian or blackfellow is surrounded by magical
influences. In many tribes th~ power to perform magic,
" sympathetic " or otherwise, is possessed by only a few
people ; but among the central tribes it is practised by both
men and women-more often, however, by the former, who
conserve the knowledge of c~rtain forms of their own.
There is also among them a distinct class of medicine-men,
whoseduty it is to discover whose magic has caused the death
of a nyone. Among the central tribes, unlike many others,
magic is not made a means of profit or emolument. A
heavy taboo reste on a great many things that the boy or
young man would like to do, and this is for...the behoof of
th~ older men of the tribe, who attach to them!elves the
choicest morsels of food and so forth. Among girls and
women the same law applies ; and the latter are sternly
forbidden to go ncar the places where the men perform
their magical ceremonie!. To terrify them away from
such spots, the natives have invented an instrument called
a " bull-roa.er "-a thin slip of wood swung round at the
end of a string, which makes a screaming. whistling noise,
which the women believe is the voice of the Great Spirit.
The natives preserve long oval piece;; of wood, which they
call churinga~. I n these arc supposed to remain the ~iri ts
of their ancestors, so that in reality they are of a fetish
nature. T hese are kept concealed in the most secret manner.
Sympathetic 111agic is of cour~e rife amongst such
a primitive people. Certain ceremonies are employP.d to
control nature so as to ensure a plentiful supply of food
and water, or to injure an enemy. One of the commonest
forms of these is the usc of the pointed stick or bone, which
is used in one form or another by all Australian tribes. T he
former is a small piece of wood, varying in length from
three to eighteen inches, resembling a skewer, and tapering
to a point. At the handle end it is top ped with a knob of
resin, to which is attached a strand of human hair. Magical
songs are sung over it, to endow it with occult potency.
The man who wishes to use it goes into the bush singly,
or with a friend, where he will be free from observation,
and planting the stick in the ground, mutters over it what
he desires to happen to his enemy. It is then left in the
ground for a few days. The evil magic is supposed to pro-
ceed from the stick to the man. who often succumbs, u nless
a medicine-man, chances to discover the implement.
Australia 52
The Australian savage has a special dread of magic con-
nected with places at a distance, and any magical apparatus
purchased or obtained from far-away tribes is supposed
to possess potency of much greater kind than if it had
been made among themselves. Thus certain little stones
traded by Northern tribes are supposed to contain a very
powerful form of evil magic called maltia. Theseare wrapped
up in many folds of bark and string, According to tl\eir
traditions this type of magic was first introduced by a Bat-
roan, who dropped it to earth where it made a great ex-
plosion at a certain spot, whence it can still be procured.
Sticks procured from a distance, with which the natives
chasti~e their wives, are sufficient by their very sight to
make the women obey their husbands. :\Tuch mystf)ry
surrounds what arc known as " debil·debil" shoes, which
consist of a pad of emu feathers, rounded at both ends, in
order that no onA should be able to trace in which direction
the wearer is journeying. Tllese are supposed to be worn
by a being called kurdaitcha, to whom deaths are attributed.
Like other savages, the Australian native believes that
death is always due to evil magic. A man may become a
kurdaitcha by submittin~ to a certain ceremony, in which the
little toe of his foot is d1slocatcd. Dressed up and painted
grotesquely, he sets out accompanied by a medicine-man
and wearing the kurdaitcha shoes, when he desires to slay
an enemy. \Vhen he spears him, the medicine-man closes
up the wound, and the victim returns to consciousness
oblivious of the fact that he is full of evil mag-ic ; but in
a while he sickens and dies ; and then it is known that he
has been attacked by a k11rdaitcha. Many long and elab·
orate ceremonies arc connected with the churinga, and these
have been well described by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen,
Howitt, Fison, and others.
Spirilual4sm in Australia has both a public and private
representation. The latter is far more general than the
former in every country except America, but although
demonstrations of spirit power are more commonly known
in Australia amongst individuals and families, than on the
rostrum, or through the columns of the journals, they are
less available for the purposes of historical record. It
seems that many Australian colonists had heard of the
Spirituali~t movement before settling in the country, and
on their arrival, pursuing the customary methods of unfold·
ment through the spirit circle, a deep interest was
awakened long before public attention was called to the
subject. In Sydney, Melbourne, Ballarat, Geelong, Bris-
bane, and numerous other towns and mining districts,
communion with spirits was successfully practised in cir-
cles and families, up to about 1867. After that epoch it
seems to have become the subject of various journalistic
reports of the usual adverse, culo~Pstic, or non-committal
character. At or about that penod. a large number of
influential persons became interested in the matter, and
not a f~v whose names were a sufficient guarantee of their
good faith, began to detail wonderful experiences in the
columns of the public journals. The debate and denial,
rejoinder and defence, called forth by these narratives,
served as propaganda of the movement, and rendered each
freshly recorded manifestation. the centre of an ever·
widening circle of interest.
In Victoria a gentleman of considerable wealth and
learning, writing under the 110111 de plume of " Schamlyn,"
entered into a warm controversy with the editor of the
Collingwood Advertiser, in defence of Spit;tualism. An-
other influential supporter of the Spiritual cause who was
an early convert, and for a time became a pillar of strength
in its maintenance, was a gentleman connected with the
editorial department of the Melbour11e Arg11s, one of the
leading journals of Victoria, and an organ well calculated
to exert a powerful sway over the minds of its readers.
Australia
As the tides of public opinion moved on, doctors, lawyers,
merchants, and men of eminence began to joins the ranks.
Tidings of phenomena of the most astounding character
poured in from distant towns and districts. :\!embers of
the press began to share the general infection, and though
some would not, and others could not avow their convic-
tions, their private preposse~sions induced them to open
their columns for debate and correspondence on the subject.
To add to the stimulus thus imparted, many of the leading
colonial journals indulged in tirades of abuse and misrep·
resentation, which only served to increase the contagion
Y.itbout in the least d•minishing its force. At length the
clergy began to arouse themselves and manifest their in-
terest by furious abuse. Denunciation provoked retort;
discussion compelled investigation. In Sydney, many con-
verts of rank and influence suddenly appeared. The late
Hon. John Bowie Wilson. Land ;\oliruster, and a champion
of temperance, became an open convert to Spiritualism,
and by his per<;onal influence no less than his public de-
fence of the cause made converts unnumbered. Amongst
the many others whose names have also been recorded in
the ranks of Spiritualism in Sydney may be mentioned
Mr. Henry Gale, Mrs. Wilson and Mrs. Gale, Mrs. 'Woolley
and 1\Irs. Greville, besides a number of other ladies ; Mr.
Greville, 1\l.P., and several other members of the Kew South
Wales Parliament and Cabinet; Hon. J. Windeyer, At-
torney-General of the Colony, subsequently one of the
judges ; l\Ir. Alfred De Lissa, an eminent barrister; Mr.
Cyril Haviland, a literary man ; Mr. Macdonald; Captain
Barron; Mr. l\Iilner Stephen a barrister of eminence, his
wife and family, and many others. Another who did more
to advance the cause of Spiritualism, and crystallize its
~cattered fragments into concrete strength than any other
individual in the ranks was l\lr. Wm. Terry, the well-known
and enterprising editor of the Melbourne Harbinger of
Light Spiritual organ,
" About 1869 " says :\lr. H. Tuttle, " the necessity for
a Spiritualistic journal was impressed deeply on the mind
of )lr. Terry. He could not cast it ofi, but pondered over
the enterprise. At this time, an exceedingly sensitive
patient described a spirit holding a scroll on which was
written " Harbinger of Light " and the motto, •· Dawn
approaches, error is passing away ; men arising shall hail
the day." This influenced him, and in August 1870, he
set to work to prepare the first number, which appeared
on the xst of September of that yeax.
" There was no organisation in Australian Spiritualism,
and :\Ir. Terry saw the advantage and necessity of associative
movement. He consulted a few friends. and in November,
1870, he organised tbe first Victorian Association of
Spiritualists. A hall was rented, and Sunday services,
consisting of essays and reading by members, enlivened
by appropriate hymns, were held. In October, 1872,
impressed with the desirability of forming a Lyceum, he
calll'.d together a few willing workers, and held the first
session on October ~oth, 187~. lt is, and has been from the
first in a nourishing condition, numbering one hundred
and fifty members, with a very handsome and complete
outfit, and excclltmt library. He has remained an officer
ever since, and conductor four sessions. He a~;sisted in
the establishment of the Spiritualist and Free-thought
Association, which succeeded the original one, and was its
first president. He has lectured occasionally to apprecia·
tive audiences, and his lectures have been widdy circulated.
His mediumship, which gave such fair promise, both in
regard towriting and spealdng, became controlled, especially
for the relief of the sick. Without the assistance of ad-
vertising he ha£ acquired a .fine practice. 'With this he
combines a trade in Reform and Spiritualistic publications,
as extensive as the colony, and the publie2.tion of the
Australia 53 Australia
Harbinger of Light, a Spiritual journal that is an honour to
the cause, and well sustains the grand philo~ophy of im-
mortality. No man is doing more for the cause or has
done more efficient work."
A short but interesting summary of the rise and progress
of Spiritualism in Australia is given in the American
Bamzu of Light, 188o, in which 1\fr. Terry's good service is
again alluded to, and placed in line with that of several
other pioneers of the movement, of whom mention has not
yet been made. It is as follows .-
"The Harbi>'gfr of Light, published at Melboume,
Australia, fumishe~ a review of the origin of its publication
and the work it has accomplished during the ten years just
closed. At its advent in 1870, considerable interest had
been awakened in the subject of Spiritualism, by the
lectures of Mr. Nayler, in Melbourne, and Mr. Leech, at
Castlemaine. The leaders of the church became dis-
turbed, and seeing their gods in danger, sought to stay
the progress of what would eventually lessen their influence
and possibly their income. But Mr. Nayler spoke and
wrote with more vigour ; the addresses of Mr. Leech were
published from week to week in pamphlet fonn, and widely
distributed. At the same time, Mr. Charles Bright, who
had published letters on Spiritualism in the AYgzts, over
an assumed name, openly identified himst>lf with the move-
ment, and spoke publicly on the subject. Shortly after,
eleven persons met and formed an association, which soon
increased to eighty members. A hymn-book was compiled,
and Sunday services began. As elsewhere, the press
ridiculed, and the pulpit denounced Spiritualism as a
delusion. A number of articlee in the Argzu brought some
of the facts prominently before the public, and the growing
interest was advanced by a public discussion between
Messrs. Tyerman and Blair. In 1872, a Sunday school, on
harmonia! principles, was established, Mr. W. H. Terry,
the proprietor of the Harbinger, being its first conductor.
Almost simultaneously with this was the visit of Dr. J. M.
Peebles, whose public lectures and work in the Lyceum
served to consolidate the movement. A controversy in
the Age, between Rev. 1\fr. Potter, Mr. Tyerman and Mr.
Terry, brought the facts and teachings of Spiritualism
into further notice.
"Soon came Dr. Peebles, Thomas 'Valker, Mrs. Britten
and others, who widened the influence of the spiritualistic
philosophy, and aide<l the Harbin~er in its efforts to estab-
lish Spiritualism on a broad rational basis. Mr. W. H.
Terry is deserving of all praise for hi.• unselfish and faithful
exertions in carrying the l!arbinger through the years of
as bard fabour as ever befell any similar enterprise, and we
bespeak for him, in hie continued efforts to make known
the evidences of a future existence, and the illuminating
truths of Soiritualism, the hearty co-operation and sym-
pathy ,f ;~11 friends of the cause."
Writing to the Banner of Ught on the subject of Mr.
Tyerman·~ accession to the Spiritual ranks, an esteemed
American corre~ondent says :-
"The Rev. J. Tyerman, of the Church of England,
resident in one of the country districts, boldly dt'clared
his full reception of Spiritualism as a great fact, and his
change of religious faith consequent upon the teachings of
spirits. Of course, l1e wae welcomed with open arms by
the whole body of Spiritualists in Melbourne, the only city
where there was any considerable number enrolled in one
association. He soon became the principal lecturer, though
not the only one employed by the Association, and well
has he wielded the sword of the new faith. He is decidedly
of the pioneer stamp, a skilful debater, a fluent speaker,
ready at any mom('nt to engage with any one, either by
word of mouth or as a writer. So widely, indeed, did he
make his influence ft>lt, and so individual was it, that a
new !>OCiety grew up around him, called tht'! Free-Thought
and Spiritualist Propaganda Society, which remainE'd in
existence till Mr. Tyerman removed to Sydney, when it
coalesced ·with the older association, under the combined
name of 1\'felbourne Spiritualist and Free-Thought Asso-
ciation."
Another valuable convert to the cause of Spiritualism,
at a time when it most needed good service, was Mrs.
Florence Williams, th<' daughter of the celebrated Eng~h
novelist, G. P. R. james, and the inheritor of his talent,
originality of thought, and high culture. This lady for a
long time officiated at the first Spiritual meetings convened
foz Sabbath Day exercises, as an acceptable and eloquent
lecturer, and her essays would have formed an admirable
epitome of spiritual revelations at the time in which they
were delivered.
The visits of several zealous propagandists have been
alluded to in previou!! quotation~. Amongst the first to
break ground as a public exponent of Spiritualism, was
the Rev. J. M. Peeble!l, formerly a minister of Battle
Creek, Michigan. Mr. Peebles was well known in America
as a fine writer and lecturer, and as such wa~ justified in
expecting courteous, if not eulogistic menti1n from the
press of a foreign country, with whom his own was on
tenns of amicable intercourse. How widely different was
the journalistic treatmt>nt he ex-periP.nced may be gathered
from his own remarks addressed to the Danner of I.iglzt
some five years after his first visit, and describing in
graphic terms the changed spirit which marked alike the
progre~s of the movement and the alteration in the tone
of public opinion. Mr. Peebles says·-
" Relative to Spiritualism and its divine p1inciples,
public sentiment has changed rapidly, and for the better,
during the past five years. Upon my late public appear-
ance in Melbourne, the Hon. john J\lcllwraith ex-Mayor
of the city, and Commissioner to out Centennial Exhibition,
took the chair, introducing me to the audit'nce. On my
previous vil'it some of the Spiritualist'! seemed a little
timid. They preferred being called investigators, remain-
ing a good distance from the front. Then my travelling
companion, Dr. Dunn, was misrepresented, and meanly
vilified in the city journal~; while I was hissed in the
market, caricatured in Pzmch, burlesqued in a theatre,
and published in the daily press as an ' ignorant Yankee,'
an ' American trickster,' a ' long-haired apostate,' and
' a most unblushing blasphemer.' But how changed 1
Recently the secular press treated me fairly. Even the
usually abusive Tel~graph published Mr. Stevemon's
article assuring the Rev. Mr. Green that I was willing to
meet him at once in a publi<: discussion. The Melbourne
Argus, one of the best daily papers in the world, the Aus-
tralasian, the Herald, and the Age, all dealt honourably by
me, reporting my lectures, if briefly, with admirable
impartiality. The press is a reflector; and those audiences
of 2,000 and 2,500 in the great Opera House on each Sunday
for several successive months, were not without a most
striking moral significance. It seemed to be the general
opinion that Spiritualism had never before occupied so
pron_1inent y~t so favourable a position in the eyes of the
public....
Efficient service was rendered to the cause of Spiritualism
by Mr. Thomas Walker, a young Englishman, first intro-
duced in the Colonies by the Rev·1· M. Peebles. Alleging
himseli to be a " trance speaker ' under the control of
certain spirits, -..ovhom he named, Mr. Walker lectured
acceptably in Sydney, Melbourne, and other places in the
Colonies on the Spiritual rostrum. In March, 1878, Mr.
Walker maintained a public debate with a Mr. M. W.
Green, a minister of a denomination termed " the Church
of Christ." This gentleman had acquired some reputation
Australia
in the Colonies as a preacher, and as one who had bitterly
opposed. and taken every possible opportunity, to mis.
represent Spiritualism. The debate, which was held
in the Temperance Hail, ?.Ielbourne, attracted large
audiences, and been extended for several nights beyond
the period originally agreed upon.
The following extracts arc taken from the }.felbourne
Age, one of the leading daily jour!lals of the city. They
are dated August 2oth, 1878, and read thu~ :
"Spiritualism is just now very much to the front in
Melbourne. The lectures of 1\lrs. Emma Hardinge-Britten,
delivered to crowded audiences at the Opera House every
Sunday evening, have naturally attracted a sort of wonder-
ing curiosity to the subject, and the interest has probably
been intensified by the strenuous efforts that are being
made in some of the orthodox pulpits to prove that the
wholl! thing is an emanation from the devil. The an-
nouncement that the famous Dr. Slade had arrived to
strengthen the ranks of the Spiritualists, has therefore
been made at a very critical juncture, and I should not be
surprised to find that the consequence will be to infuse
a galvanic activity into the forces on both sides. Though
I do not profess to be a Spiritualist. I own to having been
infected with the fashionable itch for witnessing ' physical
manifeHations,• as they are called, and accordingly I have
attended several circles with more or less gratification.
But Dr. Slade is not an ordinary medium even among
professionals. The literature of the Spiritualists is full
of his extraordinary achievements, attested to all appear-
ance by credible 'vitnesses, who have not been ashamed
to append their names to their statements. . . . I see
that on one occasion. writing in six different languages was
obtained on a single ~late, and one day. accompanied by
two learned professors, Dr. Slade had a sitting with the
Grand Duke Constantine, who obtained writing on a new
slate held by himself alone. From St. Petersburg, Dr.
Slade went to Berlin, where he is said to have obtained
:::orne marvellous manifestations in the house of Professor
ZOllner, and where he was visited by the court conjurer
to the Emperor. Samuel Bellachini. . . . My object in
vi~iting Dr. Slade can be understood when I was intra·
duced to him with my friend, whom I shall call Omega.
and who was bent on the same errand. Dr. Slade and .i\Ir.
Terry constituted the circle of four who sat around the
table in the centre of the room almost as immediately as
we entered it. There was nothing in the room to attract
attention. No signs of confederacy. human or mechanical.
The hour was eleven in the morning. The window was
unshuttered, and the sun was' shining brightly. The table
at which we sat was a new one, made especially by ·wallach
Brothers, of Elizabeth Street, of polished cedar, having
four slight legs, one fiap, and no ledges of any kind under-
neath. As soon as we examined it Dr. Slade took his seat
on one side, facing the -window, and the rest of us occupied
the other three seats. He was particularly amdous that
we should sec he had nothing about him. It has been said
that he wrote on the slate by means of a crumb of pencil
stuck in his finger-nails, but his nails were cut to the quick,
while his legs and feet were ostentatiously placed away from
the table in a side position, exposed to view the whole time.
He first produced a slate of the ordinary school l'ize, with
a wet sponge, which I used to it. A chip of pencil about
the size of a grain of wheat was placed upon it on the table ;
we joined hands, and immediately taps were heard about
the table, and in answer to a question-' Will you write?·-
from Dr. Slade, three raps were given, and he forthwith
took up the slate with the pencil lying on it, and held half
of it under the table by his finger and thumb, which clasped
the corner of the half that was outside the table, and was
therefore easily seen by all prt'SCnt. His left hand re-
Australia
mained near the centre of the table, resting on those of the
two sitters on either side of him. Several convulsive jerks
of his arm were now given, then a pause, and immediately
the sound of writing was audible to every one, a scratching
sound interrupted by the tap of the pencil which indicated,
as we afterwards found, that the t's were being cros<ed
and the i's dotted. The slate wal' then exposed, and the
words written were in answer to the question which had
been put by Omega as to whether be had psychic power
or not. I pass over the conver~ation that ensued on the
subject, and go on to the next phenomenon. To satisfy
myself that the ' trick • was not done by means of sym-
pathetic writing on the slate, I had ten minutes previously
purchased a slate from a sbop in Bourke Street. containing
three leaves, and shutting "\lp book fashion. This I pro-
duced. and Dr. Slade readily repeated his performance with
it. It was necessary to break the pencil down to a mere
crumb. in order to insert it between the leaves of the slate.
This done, the phenomenon at once recurred with this
rather perplexing difference, that the slate, instead of being
put half under the table, forced itself by a series of jerks
on to my neck, and reposed quietly under my ear, in the
eyes ofeveryone present. Thescratching then commenced;
I heard the t's crossed and the i's dotted by the moving
pencil, and at .the usual signal I opened the slate, and found
an intelligible reply to the question put. . . . Tbe next
manifestation was the levitation of one of the sitters in
his chair about a clear foot from the ground, and the
levitation of the table about two feet. I ought to have
mentioned that during the whole of the seance thue was a
good deal of by-play going on. Everyone ielt the touch
of hands more or less, and the sitters' chairs were twice
wrenehoo from under them, or nearly so, but the psychic
could not possibly have done it.... "
Says Mrs. Emma Hardinge Britten, in her Ninetemth
Century Miracle~ :-" As personal details are more graphic
than the cold narrations of passing events. we deem it
expedient in this place to give our readers an in9de view
of Spiritualism in Australia, by republishing one of the
many articles sent by the author to tbe American Spiritual
journals during her sojourn in the Colonies. The following
excerpt was written as the result of peTSonal experience,
and at a time when Spiritualism, in the usual inflated style
of journalistic literature, was • in the zenith of its triumphs.'
It is addressed to the Editor of the Ba1mer of Light, and
reads as follows :-
" · Spirituali$m in these colonies finds little or no public
repre~entation outside of Melbourne or Sydney. nevertheless
warm friends of the cause are scattered all over the land,
and endeavours are being made to enlarge the numerous
circles into public meetings, and the fugitive efforts of
whole-hearted individuals into associations as powerful
as that which exists in Melbourne. At present, the at-
tempt to e:B'ect misqionary wock in any port10ns of Australia
outside Sydney or l'l!clbournc, becomes too great a burden
to the luckless indiYidual, who has not only to do the work,
but to bear the entire cost of the undertaking, as I have
had to do in my visits to various towns in Victoria. Ex-
penses which arc cheerfully divided amongst the many in
the United States, become all too heavy for endurance
when shouldered upon the isolated workers ; hence tbe
paucity of public rcprc~entation, and the impossibility
of those who visit the Colonies. as I have done, e:B'ecting
any important pioneer work beyond the two great centres
I have named. Mr. Walker at Sydney, and I at Melbourne,
have been favoured with the large~t gatherings ever
assembled at Colonial Sunday mi'Ct:ings.
" ' Having, by desire of my spirit guides, exchanged
rostrums, he filling my place at Melbourne, and 1 his at
Sydney. we find simultaneoutly at the same time. and on
Australia 65 Austria
the same Sundays, the lessees of the two theatres we oc-
cupied rai~ing their rent upon us one hundred and fifty
per cent. The freethinkers and Spiritualists had occupied
the theatre in Sydney four years at the rate of four pound3
per Sunday. For my bene6t the landlord rai£ed the rent
to ten pounds, whilst the same wonderful spirit of accor-
dance caused the Melbourne manager to increase upon
Mr. Walker from eight pounds to a demand of twenty.
With our heavy expenses and small admission fees this
was tantamount to driving us out altogether. Both of
us have succeeded after much difficulty, and fighting
Christian warriors with the Christian arms of subtlety and
vigilance, in securing other places to lecture in; and despite
the fact that the press insult us, the pulpit curse us, and
Christians generally devote us to as complete a prophecy
of what they would wish us to enjoy everlastingly as their
piety can devise, we arc each attracting our thousands
every Sunday night, and makin~ such unmistakable marks
on public opmion a~ will not eastly be effaced again....
'' ' Dr. Slade's advent in ll·lclbournc since last September
has been productive of an immense amount of good. How
far his labours here will prove remunerative I am not pre-
pared to say. Frankly speaking, I do not advise Spirit
Mediums or speakers to visit these colonies on financial
advancement intent. There is an abundant crop of Me-
dium power existing, interest enough in the cause, and
many of the kindest hearts and clearest brains in the world
to be found here ; but the lack of organisation, to which
I have before alluded, and the imperative necessity for
the workers who come here to make their labours remu-
nerative, paralyses all attempts at advancement, except
in the sens~tion line. Still I feel confident that with united
action throughout the scattered force of Spiritualistic
thought in these Cotonics, Spiritualism might and would
supersede every other phase of religious thought in an
incredibly short space of time. 1 must not omit to mention
that the friends in every place I have visited have been
more than kind, hospitable and appreciative. The public
have defied both press and pulpit in their unstinted support
of my le~tures. The press have been equally servile, and
the Christian· world equally stirred, and equally active in
desperate attempts to crush out the obvious proofs of
immortality Spiritualism brings.
" ' In Melbourne, I had to fight my way to comply with
an invitation to lecture for the benefit of the City Hospital:
I fought and conquered ; and the hospital committee
revenge1 itself for a crowded attendance at the Town Hall
by taking my money without the grace of thanks, either
in public or private, and the simply formal acknowledg-
ment of my services by an official receipt. In Sydney,
where I now am, I was equally privileged in lecturing for
the benefit of the Temperance Alliance, and equally
honoured, after an enthusiastic and successful meeting,

of all sorts of such trash as they disgra~e their columns
with. So mote it be. The wheel willlurn some day!
During the years r88t and '82 the Australian colonists
were favoured v;ith visits from three more well-known
American Spiritualists. The first of these was Professor
Denton, an able and eloquent lecturer on geology, and one
who never failed to combine with h.is scientific addresses,
one or more stirring lectures on Spiritualism. The second
propagandist was Mrs. Ada Foye, one of the best test-writing,
rapping, and seeing Mediums, who has ever appeared in
the ranks of Spiritualism ; whilst the thitd was Mrs. E. L.
Watson, a trance-speaker.
Professor Denton's lectures created a wide-spread in-
terest amongst all classes of listeners.
It now becomes necessary to speak of one of the most
arbitrary acts of tyranny ou the part of the Victorian
Government towards Spiritualism which the records of
the movement can show. This was the interdict l?romul-
gated by " the Chief Secretary" against the propnetor of
the Melbourne Opera House, forbidding him to allow
Spiritualists to take money at the door for admission to
their services, and in effect, forbidding them to hold ser-
vices there at all. A similar interdict was issued in the
case of l\fr. Proctor, the celebrated English lecturer on
astronomy. The excuse for this tyrannical procedure
in Mr. Proctor's case, might have been justified on the
ground, that the Chief Secretary was entirely ignorant
of the fact, that astronomy had anything to do with religion,
or that it w2S not orthodox to talk about the celestial bodies
on a Sunday, except in quotations from Genesis, or Revela-
tions ; but in the case of " the Victorian Association of
Spiritualists " it was quite another point. Spiritualism
was their rcl.igion, and Spiritual lectures their Sabbath Day
exercises. Messrs. Walker, Peebles, and Mrs. Britten,
had occupied the Opera House for months together, and
admission fees had been charged at each of their Sunday
services, wjthout let or hindrance. The result of many
gatherings for the purpose of denouncing their policy may
be judged by a perusal of the following paragraph published
in the Harbinger of Light of March, 1882 :-
" On Friday last a letter was received from the Govern-
ment by the Executive of the Victorian Association of
Spiritualists, intimating that the former had no desire to
suppress the lectures, but endorsed the permit of May 1879·
The directors of the Opera Hou~e Company were inter-
viewed, and on the understanding that no money be
taken at the doors, consented to the opening of the House.
The fact being annoanced in Saturday's papers drew a
large audience to hear Mr. 'Valker's lecture on Sunday.
' Lord Macaulay on Roman Catholicism.' The ~ervices
'vill be continued as heretofore. Seats in dress circle or
stalls may be hired by month or quarter, at ,V, H. Terry's
84, Russel Street.''
During Dr. Slade's visit to Sydney, a very able and
energetic worker in Spiritualism became convinced of its
truth, in the person of Mr. E. Cyril Haviland, the author
of two excellent pamphlets and many articl~. tracts, and
good literary contributions on this subject. Mr. Haviland,
Mr. Harold Stephen, and sc\·eral other gentlemen of literary
repute in Sydney, combined during the author's last visit
to form a •• Psychological Society," the members of which
like the persons above named. represented some of the
most accomplished writers and advanced thinkers of the
city.
Mr. L. E. Barcus, an able and fiuent writer, furnished
a report of the origin and growth of thi~ society for the
Banner of Light of March x88o.
Austria: (For ancient magic among the Teutonic people
of Austria, See Teutons. See also Hungary.)
In Austria, Spiritualism was fir~t promulgated by M.
Constantine Delby of Vienna. He was a warm adherent
of Allan Kardec, and founded a society under legal aus-
pices, besides starting a Spiritual journal. The society
numbered but few members, in fact Spiritualism never
obtained much foothold in Vienna. At Buda-Pesth it
was quiteo otherwise. In a short time a considerable amount
of interest was awakened, and many persons of note began
to take part in the circles that were being formed there,
amongst these were Mr. Anton Prohasker and Dr. Adolf
Grunhut. At length a society was formed, legalised by
the State, of which Baron Edmund Vay, was elected presi-
dent. Mr. Lishner, of Pesth. built a handsome seance
ro:)m which the society rented. At that time there were
one hundred and ten members, many of them being He-
brews, though all Christians. Baron Vay was the honorary
Autography 56 Avicenna
president, Dr. Crunhut, W<\S the active president, and
these and Mr. Prohasker were amongst the most devoted
and faithful workers. The principles of the society, indeed
the basis of it were taken from the Cei.st Kraft Stoff of
Baroness Adelma Von Vay and the works of 1\llan Kardec
-purely Chri'ltian Spiriti~m. It never encouraged paid
::.'\Iediumship. All the officers were voluntary and honorary.
It had no phy~ical i\1edium, but good trance, writing and
seeing mediums.

Automatic Writing and Speaking : Writing executed
or spce<:h uttered \dthout the agent's volition, and some-
times ·without his knowledge. The term is used by
psychical researchers and app!ied particularly to the trance
phenomena of the !Wancc-room. By spiritualists, writing
or speaking produced under these conditions. are said to
be performed "under control "-that is, und'lr the con-
trolling agency of the spirits of the dead-and are therefore
not judged to be truly "automatic." The general con-
sensus of opinion, however, ascribes such performances to
the subconscious activity of the agent. Automatic writing
and speaking necessarily imply some de,dation from the
normal in the subject, though such abnormality need not
be pronounced, but may vary £rom a slight di<;turbance
of the nerve-centres occasioned by excitement or fatigue to
hystero-epilepsy or actual insanity. \Vhen the phenomena
are produced during a state of trance or somnambulism the
agent. may be entirely unconsciou~ of his actions. On the
other band the automatic writing may be executed while
the agent is in a condition scarcely va~;og from the normal
and quite capable of observing the phenomena in a critical
spirit, though perhaps i.~~:norant of a word in advance of
what he is actually writing. Between these statel' of full
consciousness or complete unconsC:ousness there are wany
intermediate stages. T11e secondary personality, as
displayed in the \\ritings or utterances. may gain only a
partial ascendancy over the primary. as may happen in
dreams or in the hypnotic trance. As a rule automatic
speech and writings display nothing more than a revivifying
of faded mental imagery, thoughts and conjectures and
impressions which never came to birth in the upper con-
~ciousness. But at times there appears an e"traordinary
exaltation o! memorv, or even of the intellectual facultie;:.
CasE's arc on record \~·here lost articles haYe been recovered
by means of automatic writing. Foreign languages which
have been forgotten, or ";th which the subject has small
acquaintance, are spoken or written fluently. Hel~ne
Smith, the subject of Profl'ssor Flournoy, even went so far
as to invent a new l:mguage, purporting to be that of the
Martians, but in reality ~bowing a marked resemblance
to French-the mother-tongue of the medium. Auto-
matic writing and speaking have been produced in
considerable quantities, mainly in connection with spirit-
ualistic circles, though it existed long before the advent
of spiritualism in the speakin~ with " tongues " of the
early ecstatics. These unintelligible outpouring<> are still
to be met with, but are no longer a marked feature of auto-
matic utterance. But, though the matter and style may
on occasion transcend the capabilities of the agent in his
normal ~tate, the great body nf automatic productions
does not !<how an erucition or literary excellence beyond
the sr.ope of the natural resourC<'s of the automist. The
style is involved, obscure, itrllated, yet possessing a super-
ficial smoothness and a suggestion of flowing periods and
musical cadences. The ideas are often shallow and in-
coherent, and all but lost in a multitude of words. The
best known of automatic writings are the Spirit Teachint:s
of the Rev. Stanton :\loses, tbe works of A. J. Davis, j .
Murray Spear, and Charles Linton, and, perhaps most
important of all. the Trance Utterances of :-.rrs. Piper, these
last offering no incon~iderable evidence for telepathy. A
good deal of poetry has been produced automatically,
notably by the Rev. T. L. Harris. Among those wbo are
known to have produced automatic writings are Goethe,
Victor Hugo, Victorien Sardou, and other eminent men
of letters. (For the hypothesis of spirit control, see article
Spiritualism.)

at Bokhara, and displayed such extraordinary precocity
that when he had reached his tenth year, he had completely
mastered the Koran, and acquired a knowledge of algebra,
the Mus~ulman theology, and the His ab ttl-Hind, or arith-
metic of the Hindoos. Under Abdallah Al- Natheli he
studied logic, Euclid. and the Almage~t. and then, as a
diversion, devoted himself to the study of medicine. He
was only twenty-one yeus old when he composed his Kitab
al-1\lajmu or, The Book of tlte Sum Totlll, whose mysteries
he afterwards endeavoured to elucidate in a commentary
in twenty volumes. His reputation for wisdom and eru-
dition was so great that on the death of his father be was
promoted by Sultan Magda! Douleth to the high office of
Grand Vizier, which he held with advanta!(e to the State
until a political revolution .accomplished the downfall of
the Samanide dynasty. He then quitted Bokhara. and

Babylonia: The conservative element in the religic.n of
Bahylonia was one of its most markrd and interr.sting
features. All the clcitics retained, even aft;:r thev reached
their highest developmr.nt, trnces of their prinii.tive de-
muniac characters. and magic was !lever divorced from
rt>ligion'. The most outstanding go<.!e were Ea. Anu aud
Enlil, the eidt>r Rei. ThC'se fonnrd a triad at the dawn
ot histcsry, and appear to have dcveloy;cd from an animistic
group of world sptrits. Although Ea became specialised
as a god of the deep, Anu as a god of the sky, and Enlil
as an earth god, each had also titlt>s whirh emphasi>cd
that they had attributes overlapping those of the others.
Thus Ea was Enki, earth lord, and as Aa was a lunar deity,
atJd he hnd also solar attributes. In the legend or Etana
and the Eagle, his heaven is stated to be in the skr. Anu
and Enlil as deities of thunder, rain and fertility. linked
closely with Ea, as Dagan, of the flooding and fertilising
Euphrates. Each of the$e dt•itios were accomp~nied by
demon groups. The spirits of di11ease were the " beloved
so'ns of Del " ; the fates were the seven daughtC'rs of Anu ;
the seven storm demons, including the dragon and serpent,
were of Ea's brood. In one of the magical incantations
translated by Mr. R. C. Thompson, occurs the following
description of Ea's primitive monster form;
The head is the head of a serpent,
From his nostrils mucus triclcfes.
The mouth is beslavc:ed with water;
The ears are those of a basilisk,
His horus arc twisted into three curls,
He wears a veil in his head-band,
The body is a sun-fish full of stars,
The base of his feet are claws,
The sole of his foot bas no heel ;
His name is Sassu-wunnu,
A sea monster, a form of Ea.
Ea was " the great magician of the gods"; his sway over
the forces of nature was secured by the performance of
magical rites, and his services were obtained by mankind,
who performed requisite ceremonies and repeated appro·
priate spells. Although he might be worshipped and
propitiated in his temple at Eridu, he could also be con-
jured in reed huts. The latter indeed appear to have been
the oldest holy places. In the Deluge myth, he malces a
revelation in a dream to his human favourite, Pir-napishtim,
the Dabylonian Noah, of the approaching disaster planned
by the gods, by addressing the reed hut in which he slept:
" 0, reed hut, hear; 0, wall, understand." The sleeper
received the divine message from the reeds. The reeds
were to the Babylonian what rowan branches were to
northern Europeans: they protected them against demons.
The dead were buried wr.!.pped in reed mats.
When the official priesthood came into existence it in·
c1ud('d two classes of magicians, the "Ashipu," who were
ex<lrcists, aud the " Mashmashu." the " purifiers." The
Ashipu priests played a prominent part in ceremonies,
which had for their obiect the magical control of nature :
in times of storm, disaster, and eclipse they were especially
active. They also took the part of " witch doctors."
Victims of disease were supposed to be pos.>essed of devour·
ing demons:
Babylonia.
Loudly roaring above, gibbering helow,
They are the bitter venom of the god~. . .
Kno\\ing no care, they grind the land like corn :
Knowing no mercy, they rage against mankind,
They spill their blood like rain.
Devouring their flesh and sucking their veins.
(Thompson's translation.)
It was the business of the A~hipn Pli<'st~ to drive out the
demon. Before he could do so he had to identify it.
HaYing done so, he rcquir<.>d next to !-.ring it under his
influence. This he accompllshed by rtciting its history
and d<'tailing it~ characttri~tic~. The secret of the magic-
ian's power was his knowledge. To cure toothach(', for
instance, it W:ls necessary to know the " Legend of the
Worm," which, vampire-like, absorbed the blood of victims,
but specialised in gums. The legend relates tllat the worm
came into existence as follows: Anu created the heaven.
the heavens created the earth, the earth created the rivers.
and the rivers created the canals, then the canals created
marshes, a nd the marshes created the "worm." Jn due
time the worm appeared before Shamash, the sun god, and
Ea, god of the deep, weeping and hunqry. " What will
you give me to cat and drink? " it cried. The gods
promised that it would get dried bones and scented wood.
Apparently the worm realised that this was the " food of
death," for it made answer: "What are dry bones to me?
Set me upon the gums that T may drink the blood of the
teeth and take away the strength of the gums." When
the worm heard this legend rcpeatt'd, it came under the
magician's power, and was disrnissed to the marshes, while
F.a was invoked to smite it. Different demons were
exorcised by di ffert>nt processes. A fever patient might
receive the following treatment :
Sprinlde this man with water,
Bring unto him a cen~er and a torch,
Thatthe plague demon which rcsteth in the body ofthc man,
Like water may trickle away.
Another method was to fashion a figure of do\Jgh, wax,
clay or pitch. This figure might be placed on a fire or
mutilated, or placed in running water to J,e washed away.
As the figure suffered, so did the demon it represented.
Dy the mngic of the word of Ea.
A third method was to relea~c a ra,en at the bedside cfthe
sick man so that it would conjure the demon of fev<.>r to take
ftight likewise. Sacrifices were also offered, ns substitutes
for patients, to provide food for the spirit of the disease.
A kid was slain and the priest muttered,
The kid is the substitute for mankind;
He hath given the kid for his life,
He hath given the head of the kid for the head of the
man.
A pig might be offered :
Give the pig in his stead
And give the flesh of it for his flesh,
The blood of it for his blood, etc.
The cures were numerous and varied. After the patient
recovered the house was pudficd by the " mashmashu"
priests. The ceremony entailed the sprinkling of sacred
water, the burning of incense, and the repetition of magicaL
charms. Houses were also protected against attack, by
placing certain plants over the doorways and window~.
An a~s·s halter seems to have been used. as horse-shoes have
been in Europe, to repel witches and evil spirits.
The purification ceremonies suggest the existence of
taboo. For a period a sick man was " unclean " and had
to be isolated. To each temple was attached a "House
of Light " in which fire ceremonies were performed, and
a " House of Washing" where patients bathed in sacred
water. Oil was also used as anointment to complete the
Babylonia 59 Bacoo
release from uncle;~nness. l oods were also t.1booed at
certain seasons. It was unlawful !or a man to eat pork
on the 3oth of Ab (July-August) or the 27th of Tisri, and
other dates. Fish, ox flesh, bread, etc. were similarly
tabooed on specific dates. A man's luck depended greatly
on his observance of these rules. But although he might
observe all ceremonies. he might still meet with ill-fortune
on unlucky days. On the festival day of 1.\farduk
(~lerodach) a man m'Jst not change his clothes nor put on
white garments, nor offer up sacrifices. Sure disaster
would overcome a king if he drove out in a chari<>t. or a
physician if he laid hands on the sick, or a priest who sat
in judgment, and so on. On lucky days good fortune was
the heritage of everyone. Good fortune meant good health
in many cases, and it was sometimes assured by worship-
ping the dreaded spirit of disea$e called Ura. A legend
related that this demon once made up his mind to destroy
all mankind. His counsellor !shun, however, prevailed
upon him to change his mind, and he said, •• Whoever will
laud my name J will bless with plenty. No one will oppose
the person who proclaims the glory of my valour. The
worshipper who chants the hymn of praise to me will not
be afflicted by disease. and he will find favour in the eyes
of the King and his nobles."
Ghosts.-Among the spirits who were the enemies of
mankind the ghosts of the dead were not the least virulent,
and especially the ghosts of those who had not been prop-
erly buried. These homeless spirits (the grave was the
home of the dead) wandered about the streets searching
for food and drink, or haunted houses. Not infrequently
they did real injury to mankind. Of horrible aspect, they
appeared before children and frightened them to death.
They waylaid travellers and mocked those who were in
sorrow. The scritch-owl was a mother who had died in
childbed and wailed her grief nightly in solitary places.
Occasionally she appeared in monstrous form and slew
wayfarers. Adam's " first wife Lilith " was a demon who
had once been beautiful and was in the habit of deceiving
lovers, and working iU against them. A hag, Labartu,
haunted mountains and marshes and children had to be
charmed against her attacks. She also had a human his-
tory. The belief that the spirits of the dead could be
conjured from their graves to make revelations was also
prevalent in Babylonia. In the Gilgamesh epic, the hero
visits the tomb of his old friend and fellow-warrior Ea-Bani.
The ghost rises like a " weird gust " and am;wers the
various questions addressed to it with great sadness.
Babylonian outlook on the future life was tinged by pro-
found gloom and pessimism. It was the fate of even the
ghosts of the most fortunate and ccrcmoniaHy buried dead
to exist in darkness and amidst dust. The ghost of Ea-
Bani said to Gilgamcsh :
" Were I to inform thee the law of the underworld
which I have experienced,
Thou wouldcst sit down and shed tears all day
long."
Gilgamesh lamented :
" The sorrow of tbe underworld hath taken hold upon
thee."
Priests who performed magical ceremonies had to be
clothed in magical garments. They received inspiration
from their clothing. Similarly the gods derived power
from the skins of animals with which they were associated
from the earliest time. Thus Ea was clad in the skin of

The dead were not admitted to the heavens of the gods.
When a favoured human being, like Utnapishtim, the
Babylonian Noah, joined the company of the gods, he
bad assigned to him an island Paradise where Gilgames.h
visited him. There he dwelt with his wife. Gilgamesh
was r.ot p : nmt ted to land, and held converse with his
immortal ancestor, sitting in his boat. The deities se-
cured immortality by eating the '' food of life " and
drinking the " water of life." DONALD MACKENZIE.

Bacon, Roger, was born near Ilchcstcr in Somerset, in
1214. In his boyhood he displayed remark~ble precocity,
and in due time, having entered the order of St. Francis,
he studied mathematics and medicine in Oxford and Paris.
Returning to England, he devoted attention to philosophy
and also wrote Latin, Greek, and Hebrew Gramma.rs. He
was a pioneer of astronomy and was acquainted with the
properties of lenses, so that he may have foreshadowed
the telescope. In the region of the mechanical sciences,
his prophecies are noteworthy since he not only speaks
of boats which may be propelled without oars, but of cars
which may move without horses, and even of machines
to fly in the air. To him we arc indebted for important
discoveries in the science of pure chemistry. His name
is for ever associated with the making of gunpowder, and
if the honour cannot be wholly afforded him, bis experi-
ments with nitre were at least a far step towards the dis-
covery. His study of alchemical subjects led him, as was
natural, to a belief in the philosopher's stone by which
gold might be purified to a degree impossible by any other
means, and also to a belief in the elixir of life whereby on
similar principles of purification, the human body might
be fortified against death itself. Not only might man
become practically immortal by such means but, by know-
ledge of the appropriate herbs, or by acquaintance with
planetary influences, he might attain the same consum-
mation. As was natural in an ignorant age, Bacon was
looked on with considerable suspicion which ripened into
persecution. The brethren of his order practically cast
him out, and he was compelled to retire to Paris, and to
submit himself to a r~gime of repression. A prolific pen·
man, he was forbidden to write, and it was not till 1266
that Guy de Foulques, the papal legate in England-sub-
sequently Pope Clement TV.-hearing of Bacon's fame,
invited him to break his enforced silence. Bacon hailed
the opportunity and in spite of hardship and poverty,
finished his Opus Majus, Opus Minus and Opus Tertium.
These works seem to have found favour with Clement,
for the writer was allowed to return to Oxford, there
to continue his scientific studies and the composition of
scientific works. He essayed a compendium of philosophy
of which a part remains, but its subject-matter was
displeasing to the ruling powers and Bacon's misfortunes
began afresh. His books were burned and again he was
thrown into prison. where he remained for fourteen years,
and during that period it is probable that he continued to
write. About 1292 he was again at liberty, and within
the next few years-probably in 1294-he died. Bacon's
works were numerous and, while many still remain in
manuscript, about a dozen have been printed at various
times. Many are obscure treatises on alchemy and deserve
little attention, but the works he wrote by invitation of
Clement are the most important. The Opus M ajus is
divided into six parts treating of the causes ot error, the
relation between philosophy and theology, the utility of
grammar, mathematics, perspective and experimental
science. The Opus Minus, of which only part has been
preserved, was mtended to be a summary of the former
work. The Opus Tertium though written after the other
two, is an introduction to them, and also in part supple-
Bacon 60
mentary to them. These works, large though they be,
seem to have been only the forerunners of a vast work
treating of the principles of all the sciences, which, however,
was probably little more than begun. :Much of Bacon's
work and many of his beliefs must, of cour~e. be greatly
discounted, but judging the man in relation to his time,
the place he takes is a high one. His devotion to the
experimental sciences was the point wherein he differed
from most from his contemporaries, and to this devotion
is to be accounted the fame which he then possessed and
sti!l possess.
But no sketch of Bacot~'s life would be complete without
some account of the legendary material which has gathered
around his name, and by virtue of which he holds rank as
a great magician in the popular imagination. \Vhen, in
the sixteenth cc:ttury, the study of magic was pursued
·with increased zeal, the name of Friar Bacon became
more popular, and not only were the traditions worked
up into a popular book, entitled The History of Friar
Baco11, but one of the dramatists of the age, Robert Green,
founded upon them a play, which was often acted, and
of which there are several editions. The greater part of
the history of Friar Bacon, as far as it related to that cele-
brated personage, is evidently the invention of the writer,
who appears to have Jived in the time of Queen Elizabeth;
he adopted some of the older traditions, and filled up his
narrative with fables taken from the common story books
of the age. We are here first made acquainted with two
other legendary conjurers, Friars Bungay and Vander-
mast; and the recital is enlivened with the pranks of
Bacon's servant Miles.
According to this legendary history, Ro!Jer Bacon was
the son of a wealthy farmer in the West of England, who
had placed his son with the parish priest to gain a little
scholarship. The boy soon showed an extraordinary
ability for learning, which was encouraged by the priest,
but which was extremely disagreeable to the father, who
intended him for no other profession but that of the plough.
Young Bacon fled from home, and took shelter in a monas-
tery, where he followed his studies to his heart's content,
and was eventually sent to complete them at Oxford.
There he made himself a proficient in the occult sciences,
and attained to the highest proficiency in magic. At
length he had an opportunity of exhibiting his skill before
the court, and the account of his exploits on this occasion
may be given as a sample of the style of this quaint old
history.
" The king being in Oxfordshire at a nobleman's house,
was very desirous to sec thi~ famous friar. for he had heard
many times of his wondrous things that he had done by
his art, therefore he sent one for him to desire him to come
to the court. Friar Bacon kindly thanked the king by
the messenger, and said that he was at the king's service
and would suddenly attend him. •bllt. sir.' saith he to
the gentleman, ·I pray you make haste or else I shall he
two hours before you at the court.' 'Forall your learning",
answered the gentleman, ' I can hardly believe thi!', for
scholars, old men, and travellers, may lie by authority.'
' To strengthen your bPlief ' said Friar Bacon, ' I could
presently ~how you the last wench that you kissed withal,
but I will not at this time.' ' One is as true as the other,'
said the gentleman, • and I would laugh to see either.'
• You shall see them both within these four hours.' quoth
the friar. • and therefore make what haste you can.' • I
will prevent that by my speed,' said the gentleman, and
with that he rid his way ; but he rode out of his way, as
it should seem, for he bad but five miles to ride, and yet
was he better than three hours a-riding them, so that Friar
Baccn by his art was with the king before he came.
" The king kindly welcomed him, and said that he long
Bacon
time had desired to see him, for he had as yet not heard
of his like. Friar Baccm answered him, that fame had
belied him, and given him that report that his poor studies
had never deserved, (or h~ believed that art had many
sons- more excellent than himseli was. The king com-
mended him for his modesty, and told him that nothing
could become a wise man le~s than boasting : but yet
withal he requested him now to be no niggard of his know-
ledge, but to show hi~ queen and him some of his skill
• I were worthy of neither art or knowledge,' quoth Friar
Bacon, ' should I deny your majesty this small request ; I
pray seat yourselves. and you sh.'lll see presently what
my poor skill can perform.' The king, queen, and nobles
S:it them all down. They having done so, the friar waved
his wand, and presently was heard such excellent music,
that they were all amazed, for they all said they had never
heard the like. • This is.' said the friar, • to delight the
sense of hearing,-! will delight all your other senses ere
you depart hence.' So waving his wand again. there was
louder music heard, and pre~ently five dancers entered,
the first like a court laundre$5, the second like a footman,
the third like a usurer, the fourth like a prodigal, the fifth
like a fool. These did divers excellent changes, so that
they gave content to all the beholders, and having done
their dance they all vanished away in their order as they
came in. Thus feasted two of their senses. Then waved he
his wand again, and tltere was another kind of music heard,
and whilst it was playing, there was suddenly before them
a table, richly covered with all sorts of delicacies. Then
desired he the Icing and queen to taste of some certain rare
fruits that were on the table, which they and the nobles
there present did, and were very highly pleased with the
taste ; they being satisfied, all vanished away on the
sudden. Then waved he his wand again, and suddenly
there was such a smell, as if all the rich perfumes in the
whole world had been then prepared in the best manner
that art could set them out. Whilst he feasted thus their
smelling, he waved his wand again, and there came divers
nations in sundry habits, as Russians, Polanders, Indians,
Armenians, all bringing sundry kinds of furs, such as their
countries yielded, all which they presented to the king
and queen. These furs were so soft to the touch that they
highly pleased all those that handled them. Then, after
some odd fantastic dances, after their country manner,
they vanished away. Then asked Friar Bacotl the king's
majesty if that he desired any more of his skill. The king
answered that he was fullv .satisfied for that time, and.that
he only now thought of something that he ruight bestow
on him, that might partly sati~fy the kindness he had r~
ceived. Friar Bacon said that he desired nothing so much
as his majesty's love, and if that he might be assured of
that, he would tJtink himself happy in it. ' For that,'
said the kin~. • be thou ever sure, in token of which
receive this Jewel,' and withal gave him a costly jewel
from his neck. The friar did with great reverence thank
his majesty, and said, • As your majesty's vassal you shall
ever find me ready to do you service ; your time of need
shall :find it both beneftcial and delightful. But amongst
all these gentlemen I sec not the man that your grace did
send for me by; sure he hath lost his way, or else met with
some sport that detain!' him so long ; I promised to be
here before him, and all this noble assembly can witness
I am as good as my word-I hear him coming. With
that entered the gentleman, all bedirted, for he had rid
through ditches, quagmires, plashes, and waters, that he
was in a most pitiful case. He, seeing the friar there,
looked full angrily, and bid a plague on all his devils, for
they had led him out of his way, and almost drowned him.
•Be not angry, sir.' said Friar Bacon, •here is an old friend
of yours that hath more cause, for she hath tarried these
Bacon 61
three hours for you,'- \\ith that he pulled up the hangings,
and behind him stood a kitchen-maid with a b;u:ting-
ladle in her hand- ' now am I as good as my word with
you, for I promised to help you to your sweetheart,-
how do you like this ? ' ' So ill,' answered the gentleman,
'that I will be avenged of you.' 'Threaten not,' said
FriaY Bacotl, ' lest I do you more shame, and do you take
heed bow you give scholars the lie again ; but because I
know not how well you are stored with money at this time,
I will bear your wench's charges home.' 'With that she
vanished away."
This may be taken as a sort of exemplification of the
class of exhibitions which were probably the result of a
superior knowledge of natural science, and which were
exaggerated by popular imagination. They bad been
made, to a certain degree, familiar by the performances
of the skilful jugglers who came from the cast, and who
were scattered throughout Europe; and we read not on-
frequently of such magical feats in old writers. ·when
the Emperor Charles IV. was married in the middle of the
fourteenth century to the Bavarian Princess Sophia in the
city of Prague, the father of the princess brought a waggon-
load of magicians to assist in the festivities. Two of the
chief proficients in the art, Zytho the great Bohemian
sorcerer, and Gouin the Bavarian, were pitted against
each other, and we are told that after a desperate trial of
skill, Zytho, opening his ja·ws from ear to ear, ate up his
rival without stopping till be came to his shoes, which he
spit out, because, as he said, they had not been cleaned.
After having performed thi.! strange feat, he restored the
unhappy sorcerer to life again. The idea of contests like
th~ seems to have been taken from the scriptural narrative
of the contention of the Egyptian magicians against Moses.
The greater number of Bacon's exploits are mere adapta-
tions of medireval stories, but they show, nevertheless,
what was the popular notion of the magician's character.
Such is the story of the gentleman who, reduced to poverty
and involved in debt, sold himself to the evil one, on
condition that he was to deliver himself up as soon as his
debts were paid. As may be imagined without much
difficulty, he was not in haste to satisfy his creditors, but
at length the time came when he could put them off no
longer, and then. in his despair, he would have committed
violence on himself had not his hand been arrested by
Bacon. The latter, when be had heard the gentleman's
story, directed him to repair to the place appointed for his
meeting vlith the evil one, to deny the devil's claim, and to
refer for judgment to the first person who should pass
" In the mon1ing, after that be had blessed himself, he
went to the wood, where he found the devil ready for him.
So soon as lle came near, the devil said : ' Now, deceiver,
arc you come? Now shall thou see that I can and will
prove that thou hast paid all thy debts, and therefore thy
soul belongest to me.' ' Thou art a deceiver,' said the
gentleman, ' and gav~st me money to cheat me of my soul,
for else why wilt thou be thine own judge ?-let me have
some others to judge between us.' ' Content,' said the
devil, ' take whom thou wilt.' • Then I will have,' said
the gentleman, ' the next man that cometh this way.'
Hereto the devil agreed. No sooner were these words
ended, but Friar Bacon came by, to whom this gentleman
spoke, and requested that he would be judge in a
weighty matter between them two. The friar said he
was content, so both parties were agreed ; the devil told
Friar Baco11 how the ease stood between them in this
manner. ' Know, friar, that I seeing this prodigal like
to starve for want of food, lent him money, not ouly to buy
him victuals, but also to redeem his lands and pay his
debts, conditionally that so soon as his debts were paid,
that he should give himself freely to me; to this, here is
Bacon
his hand '-showing him the bond. 'Now, my time i~
expired, for all his debts ar& paid, which be cannot deny.'
' This c~se is plain, if it be so that his debts are paid.'
' His silence confirms it.' said the devil, ' therefore give
him a just sentence.' ' I will,' said l'riar Bacon, ' but
first tell me,'-speaking to the gentleman-' didst thou
never yet give the devil any of his money back, nor requite
him in any w:rys? ' 'Kever had he anything of me as yet,'
answered the gentleman. ' Then never let him have
anything of thee, and thou art free. Deceiver of man-
kind,' said he, speaking to the devil, ' it was thy bargain
never to meddle with him ~o long as he "as indebted to
any ; now how canst thou demand of him anything when
he is indebtM for all that be hath to thee ? 'When be
payeth thee thy money, then take him as thy due ; till
then thou hast nothing to do with him, and so I cbarge
thee to be gone.' At this the devil vauished with great
horror, but Friar Bacon comforted the gentleman, and
sent him home with a quiet conscience, bidding him never
to pay the deYil's money back, as he valued his own
safety.''
Bacot~ now met with a companion, Friar Bungay, whose
tastes and pursuits were congenial to his own, and with his-
assistance he undertook the exploit for which he was mo~t
famous. He had a fancy that he would defend England
against its enemies, by walling it with brass, preparatory
to which they made a head of that metal, Their intent
was to make the head speak, for which purpose they raised
a spirit in a wood, by whose direction~ they made a fumi-
gation. to which t11e head was to be exposed during a month,
and to be carefully watched, because if the two friars did
not hear it before it had ceased speaking, their labour
would be lost. Accordingly, the care of watching over
the head while they slept was entrusted to Bacon's man
:MLles. The period of utterance unfortunately came while
Miles was watching. The head suddenly uttered the two
words, "Time is." Miles thought it was unnecessary to
disturb his master for such a brief speech, and sat still.
In half an hour, the bead again broke silence v..ith the
words, " Time was." Still Miles waited until, in another
half hour, the head said, " Time is past," and fell to the
ground witb a terrible noise. Thus, through the negligence
of )tiles, the labour of the two friars was thrown away.
The Iring soon required Friar Bacon's services, and the
latter enabled bim, by his perspective and burning-glasses,
to take a town which he was besieging. In consequence
of this success, the kings of England and France made
peace, and a grand court was held, at which the German
conjurer, Vandermast, was brought to try his skill against
Baco11. Their performances were something in the styl~
of Bae<m's former exhibition before the king and queen.
Vandermast, in revenge, sent a soldier to kill Bacon, but
in vain. Next follow a series of adventures which con..cist
of a few medireval stories very clumsily put together among
which are that known as the Friar and the Boy, that
which appeared in Scottish verse, under the title of Tile
Friars oj Berwick, a tale taken from the Gesta Romanorum,
and some others. A contention in magic between Vander-
mast and Bungay, ended in lhe deaths of both. The
servant Uiles next turned conjurer, having got hold of
one of Bacon's books, and escaped with a dreadful fright,
and a broken leg. Everything now seemed to go wrong.
FriaY Bacon " had a gla•s which was of that excellent
nature that any man might behold anything that be
desired to see within the compass of fifty miles round about
him." In this glass be used to show people what their
relations and friends w~re doing, or where they were.
One day two young gentlemen of high birth came to look
into the glass, and they beheld their fathers desperately
fighting together, upon which they drew their swords and'
Bacotl 62 Banshee
slew each other. Bacon was so shocked that he broke his
glass, and hearing about the same time of the deaths of
Vandermast and Bungay, he became melancholy. and at
length he burnt his books of magic, distributed his wealth
among poor scholars and others, and became an anchorite.
Thus ended the life of Friar Bacon, according to " the
famous history," which probably owed most of its incidents
to the imagination of the writer.
Bacotl : A common name for the augurs and sorcerers of
Tonquin. They are often consulted by the friends of
deceased persons for the purpose of holding communication
with them.
Backstrom, Dr. Slglsmund : (See Rosicrucians}.
Bad: A Jinn of Persia who is supposed to have command
over the wind!' and tempests. He presides over the
twenty-second day of the month.
Badger : To bury the foot of a badger underneath one's
sleeping-place is belit!vcd by the Voodoo worshippen: and
certain Gypsy tribes to excite or awaken love.
Bael : A demon cited in the Grand Grimoire (q.v.). and head
of the infernal powers. It is with him that '\Vierius com-
mences his inventory of the famous Pscudonomarchia
Daemonum. He alludes to Bael as the first monarch of hell,
and says that his estates are situated on the eastern regions
thereof. He ha~ three heads, one, that of a crab, another
that of a cat. and the third tbat of a man. Sixty-six legions
obey him.
Bagoe : A pythoness, who is believed to have been the
Erithryean sibyl. She is said to have been the first woman
to have practised the diviner's art. She practised in
Tuscany, and judged all events by the ~ound of thunder.
Bagommedes : a knight mentioned by Gautier in the
Coate du Graal. It is said that he was fastened to a tree
by Kay and left hanging head downwards, until released
by Perceval. On Bagommede's return to the court he
challenged Kay, but was prevented by Arthur from
slaying him.
Bahaman : A jinn who, according to Persian tradition,
appeased anger, and in consequence governed oxen, sheep,
and all animals of a peaceful disposition.
Bahlr: (" Brightness.") A mystical Hebrew treatise of
the twelfth or thirteenth century, the work of a French
rabbi, by name Isaac ben Abraham of Posquieres, com-
monly called " Isaac the Blind." (See Kabala).
Baian : son of Simeon, King of the Bulgarians, and a
mighty magician, who could transform himself into a wolf
whenever h'l desired. He could also adopt other shapes
and render himself invisible. He is alluded to by Ninauld
in his Lyca11thropie (page roo).
Balan : A monarch great and terrible among t!lc infernal
powers, according to Wierius. He has three heads, those
of a bull. a man, and a ram. Joined to these is the tail
of a serpent, the eyes of which burn with fire. He be-
strides an enormous bear. He commands forty of the
infernal legions, and rules over finesse, ruses and middle
courses.
Balasius : To describe this stone in fewer words than
Leonardus has used would be impossible. It is " of a
purple or rosy colour, and by some is called the placidus
or pleasant. Some think it is the carbuncle diminished
in its colour and virtue; just as the virtue of the female
differs from that of the male. It is often found that the
external part of one and the same stone appears a ba!asius,
and the internal a carbuncle, from whence comes the saying
that the balasius is the carbuncle's house. The virtue of
the balasius is to overcome and repress vain.thought.s and
luxury ; to reconcile quarrels among friends ; and it be-
friends the human body with a good habit of health. Being
bruised and drunk with water, it relieves infirmities in the
eyes, and gives help in disorders of the liver ; and what
is still more surprising, if you touch the four corners of a
house, garden or vineyard, with the balasius, it will preserve
them fiom lightning, tempest, and worms."
Balcoin, Marie: a sorceress of the country of Labour,
who attended the infernal Sabbath in the reign of Henry !V
of France. In the indictment against her it was brought
forward that she had eaten at the Sabbatic meeting the
ear of a little child. For her numerous sorceries she was
condemned to be burnt.
Balkan Peninsula : See Slavs ; Greece, Modern; Vampire, etc.
Ballou, Adln: A Universalist minister who in 184z
formed the Hopedale Community (q.v.). He was one of
those who;;e doctrines prepared the way for spiritualism
in America, and who, after that movement had been in-
augurated. became one of its most enthusiastic protago·
nists (See America, U.S. of).
Bator : a mighty King of the Formorians, usually styled
"Bator of the Evil Eye," in Irish mythical tales. It was
believed that he was able to destroy by means of an angry
glance. When his eyelid became heavy with years, it is
s:J.id that he had it raised by means of ropes and pulleys,
so that he might continue to make use of his magical gift :
but his grandson, Lugh, the Sun-god, crept near him one
day when his eyelid had drooped momentarily, and slew
him with a great stone which sank through his eye and
brain.
Balsamo, Peter : (See Cagllostrol.
Baltazo : One o! the demons who pos~essed a young woman
of Laon, Nicole Aubry, in the year 1566. He went to sup
with her husband, under the pretext of freeing her from
demon-posse3sion, which he dtd not accomplish. It was
observej that at supper he did not drink, which shows that
demons are averse to water.
Baltus, J ean Francois : A learned Jesuit who died in I743·
In his Reply to the History of the Oracle$ of Fontenelle, pub-
lished in Strasbourg in I709, he affirmed that the oracles
of the ancients were the work of demons, and that they
were reduced to silence during the mission of Christ upon
the earth.
Banshee : An Irish supernatural being of the wraith type.
The name implies " female fairy.'' She is usually the
possession of a specific family. to a member or members
of whom she appears before the death of one of them.
Mr. Tbist!eton Dyer, writin~ on the Banshee saye:
·• Unlike. also, many of the legendary beliefs of this kind,
the popular accounts illus~rative of it are related on the
evidence of all sections of th!> community, many an en-
lightened and well-informed advocate bcing enthusiastic
in his v:ndication of its reality. It would seem, however,
that no family which is not of an ancient and noble stock
is honoured with this visit of the Banshee, and hence its
non-appearance has been regarde:i as an indication of
disqualification in this respect on the part of the person
about to die. • If I am rightly informed,' writes Sir Walter
Scott, • the distinction of a Datts!tce is only allowed to
families of the pure Milesian ftock. attd is never ascribed
to any descendant of the proudest Norman or the boldest
Saxon who followed the banner of Strongbow, much less
to adventurers of later dates who have obtained settlements
in the Green Isl(',' Thus, an amusing ~tory is contained
in an Irish elegy to the effect that on the death of one of
the Knights of Kerry, when the Banshee was heard to
lament his decease at Dingle-a seaport town, the property
of those knights-aU the merchants of this place were
thrown into a state of alarm lest the mournful and ominous
wailing should be: a forewarning of the death of one of them,
but. as the poet humorously points out, there was no
necessity for them to be anxious Olt this point. Although,
through misfortune, a family may be brought down from
high estate to the rank of peasant tenants, the Bansh~6
Banshee 63 Baphomet
never leaves nor forgets it till tbc last member has been
gathered ·to his fathers in the churchyard. The ~Iac­
Carthy!:, O'Fiahertys. lllagmths, O'Ncils, O'Rileys, O'Sulli-
vans, O'Rcardons, have their Banshus, though many
representatives of these names arc in abject po,·erty.
" ' The Banshee.' says 1\Ir. :IIcAnally, 'is rt:ally a dis-
embodied soul, that of one who in life was strongly at-
tached to the family, or who bad good reason to hate all
its members. Thus, in different instances, the Banshee's
~ong may be inspired by different motive~. When the
Banshee loves those she calls, the song is a low, soft r.hant.
giving notice, indeed, of the ci~e proximity of the angel
of death, but with a tenderne:;s of tone that rc~surcs the
one destined to die and comforts the survivors ; rather a
welcome than a warning. and havin~ in its tones a thrill
of <>xultation, as though the m~enger spirit were bringing
glad tidings to him summoned to join the waiting throng
of his ar:ccsters.' To a doomed member of the f2.mily of
the O'Reardons the Banshee ~cnerally appears in the form
of a beautiful woman, 'and smgs a song so sweetly solemn
as to rPconcile him to his approaching fate.' But if, during
his lifetime, the Ban~J:ce wac; an enemy of the family, the
cry is the scream of a fiend, howling with demoniac delight
over the coming death agony of another of his foes.
" Hence, in Ireland, the hateful 'Banshee ' is a source
of dread to many a lamily against which she bas an enmity.
' It appears,' adds McAnally, ' that a noble family, whose
name is still familiar in Mayo, is attended by a Banshee
of this description-the spirit of a young girl, deceived, and
afterwards murdered by a former head of the family. With
her dying breath she cursed her murderer, and promised
she would attend him and his forever. After many years
the chieftain reformed his ways, and his youthful crime
was almost forgotten even by himself, when one night, as
he and his family were seated by the fire, the mo~t terrible
shrieks were suddenly heard outside the castle walls. All
ran out, but saw nothing. During the night the screalll!'
continued as though the castle were besieged by demons,
and the unhappy mao recognised in the cry of the Banshee
the voice of the young girl he had murdered. The next
night he was assassinated by one of his followers, when
again tbe wild une.nthly screams were heard exulti.ng over
his fate. Since that night the • hateful Banshee ' has, it
is s;Ud, never failed to notify the family, with shrill cries
of revengeful ::;!adnes!:, when the time of one of their number
has arrived."
•· Among some of the recorded instances of the Banshee's
appearance may be mentioned one related by :;)rliss L 'i:frau,
the nieca of Sheridan, in the Memoirs of her grandmother,
11m. France.> Sheridan. From this account we gather that
Miss Eliza.beth Sheridan was a firm believer in the Bat:.<hee,
and firmly maintained that the one attached to the Sheri-
dan family was distincUy heard lamenting beneath the
window> of the family residence before the news arrived
from France of Mrs. Frances Sheridan's death at Blois.
Sl:re added that a niece of Miss Sheridan made her very
angry by observin~ that as Mrs. Frances Sheridan was by
birth a Chamberlame, a family of English extraction, she
had no right to the guardianship of an Irish fairy, and that
therefore the Banshee must have made a mistake. Then
there is the well-known case related by Lady Fanshawe
wlio tells us how, when on a visit in Ireland, she was a·
wakenei at midnight by a loud scream outside her window.
On ll~oking out she saw a young and rather handsome
woman, with dishevelled hair, who vanished before her
eyes with another shriek. On communicating the circum-
stance in the morning, her host replied, ' A near relation
of mine died last night in the castle, and before such an
event happens, the female spectre whom you have seen
is always visible."
" This weird apparition is generally supposed to assume
the form of a woman, sometimes young, but more often
old. She is usually attired in a loose white drapery, and
her long ragged locks hang O\•er her thin shoulders. As
night time approaches ~he occa.•ionally becomes visible,
and pours forth her mournful wail-a sound said to re-
semble the melancholy moaning of the wind. Oftentimes
she is not seen but only heard, yet she is supposed to be
always clearly discernible to the person upon whom she
specially waits. Respecting the history of the Banshee,
popular tradition in many in:.1:anccs accounts for its pres-
. cnce al! the spirit of some mortal woman whose destinies
haYe become linked by some accident with those of the
family she follows. It is related r.ow the Banshee of the
family of the O'Briens of Thomond wa!: originally a woman
who had been seduced by one of the chiefs of that race-
an act of indiscretion which ultimately bro1ight about
her death."

Baphomet : The goat-idol of the Templars (q.v.) and the
deity of the sorcere:s' Sabbath. The name i)) composed
of three abbreviations : Tern. ohp. Ab, Templi omnium
kominttm pacis abhas, " the father of the temple of uni-
ve~al peace among men." Some authorities hold that
the Baphomet was a monstrous bead, others that it was
a demon in the form of a goat. An account of a veritable
Baphometic idol is as follows : " A pantheistic and magical
figure of the Absolute. The torch placed between the two
horns, represents the equilbrating intP.lligence of the triad.
The goat's head, which is synthetic, and unites some char-
acterietics of the dog, bull, and ass, represents the exclu~ve
respon5ibility of matter and the expiation of bodily sins
in the body. The hands are human, to exhibit the sanctity
of labour ; they make the sign of esotericism above and
below, to impress mystery on initiates, and they point at
two lunar crescents, the upper being white and the lower
black, to explain the correspondences of good and evil,
mercy and justice. The lower part of the body is veiled,
portraying the mysteries of univer$al generation. which
is expressed solely by the symbol of the caduceus. The
belly of the goat is scaled, and should be coloured green,
the semicircle above should be blue ; the plumage, reaching
to the breast, should be of various hue~. The goat has
fema!e breasts, and thus its only human characteristics
are those of maternity and toil, otherwise the signs of
redemption. On its forehead, between the horns and
beneath the torch, is the sign of the microcosm, or the
pentagram with one beam in the ascendant, symbol of
human intelligence, which, placed th1Js below the torch,
make3 the flame of the latter an image of divine revelation.
This Pantheos should be seated on a cube, and its foot-
stool should be a single ball, or a ball and a triangular
stool."
Wright (Narratives of Sorcery and Magic), writing on
the Baphomet says:-" Another charge in the accusation
of the Templars seems to have been to a great degree proved
by the depositions of witnesses ; the idol or head which
they are said to have worshipped, but the real character
or meaning of wliich we are totally \Jnable to explain.
Many Templars confessed to having seen this idol, but as
they described it differently, we must suppose that it was
not in all cases represented under the same form. Some
said it was a frightful head, with long beard and sparkling
eyes; others $aid it was a man's skull ; some described
it as having three face£ ; some said it was of wood, and
others of metal ; one witness described it as a painting
(tabula picta) representing the image a man (imago
/lominis) and said that when it was shown to l1im, he was
ordered to 'adore Christ, his creator.' Accordin~ to some
it was a gilt figure, either of wood or metal; wh1le others
Baphomet 64 Bassantin
described it as painted black and white. According to
another deposition, the idol had four feet, two before and
two behind ; the one belonging to the order at Paris, was
said to be a silver head, with two faces and a beard. The
novices of the order were told always to regard this idol
3Z their saviour. Dcodatus jaffet, a knight from the south
of France, who had been received at Pedenat, deposed
that the person who in his case performed the ceremonies
of reception, showed him a head or idol, which appeared
to have three faces, and said, 'You must adore this as your
saviour, and the saviour of the order of the Temple • and
that he was made to worshif the idol, saying, • Blessed
be he who shall S:lve my sou .' Cetlus Ragoni!', a knight
received at Rome in a chamber of the palace of the Lateran,
gave a ~omewhat similar account. Many other witne!'S s
spoke of having seen these heads, which, however, were,
perhaps, not shown to everybody, for the greatest number
of those who spoke on thts subject, said that they had
heard speak of the head, but that they had never seen it
themselves ; and many of them declared their disbelief
in its existence. A friar minor deposed in England t hat
an English Templar had assured him that in that count ry
the order had four principal idols, one at London, in the
Sacristy of the Temple, another at Bristelham, a third at
Brueria (Bruern in Lincolnshire), and a fourth beyond
the Humber.
" Some of the knights from the south added another
circumstance in their confessions relating to this head.
A templar of Florence, declared that, in the secret meetings
of the chapters, one brother said to the others. shO\\ing
them the idol, ' Adore this head. This head is your God
and your Mahomet.' Another, Gauserand de Montpesant,
said that the idol was made in the figure of Baffomet (in
figuram Baffomeli); and another, Raymond Rubei, de-
scribed it as a wooden bead, on which was painted the
figure of Baphomet, and he adds, • that he worshipped it
by kissing its feet, and exclaiming Xalla,' which he des·
cribes as ' a word of the Saracens' (verbum Saracenorr1m).
This has been seized upon by some as a proof that
the Templars had secretly embraced 1\Iahometanism, as
Baffom~t or Baphomet is evidently a corruption of Mahomet ;
but it must not be forgotten that the Christians of the West
constantly used the word Mahomst in the mere signification
of an idol, and that it was the desire of those who conducted
the prosecution against the Templars to show their intimate
intorcourse with the Saracens. Others, especially Von
Hammer, gave a Greek derivation of the word, and assumed
it as a proof that gnosticism was the secret doctrine of
the temple. . . . "
Baptism : It was said that at the witches' Sabbath
children and toads were baptised with certain horrible
rites. This was called the baptism of the devil.
Baptism of the Line : A curious rite is performed on
persons crossing the equator for the first time. The sailors
who arc to carry it out dress themselves in quaint costumes.
The Father of the Line arrives in a cask, accompanied by
a courier, a devil, a hair-dresser, and a miller. The un-
fortunate passenger has his hair curled, is liberally sprinkled
~ith flour, and then has water showered upon him, if be
is not ducked. The origin of this custom is not known,
nor is it quite clear what part the devil plays in it. It
is said, however, that it may be averted by tipping the
sailors.
Baquet : A large circular tub which entered largely into
the treatment which D'Eslon, the friend and follower of
Mesmer, prescribed for his patients. Puysegur tells us
in his book Dr1 111aqnetisme A11imal, that in the baquet
were placed some bottles, arranged in a particular manner,
and partly covered with water. It was fitted with a lid
in which were several hoi~. through which pa!'sed iron
rods, connecting the patients, wbo sat round the contri-
vance, with the interior of the tub. The operator wa&
armed "ith a shorter iron rod. \\'bile the patlents waited
for the symptoms of the magnetic treatment, ~omeone
pla}'ed upon a pianoforte, a device which is frequently
adopted at seances. The symptoms included violent con-
vulsions, cries, laughter, and vomiting. This state they
called the crisis, and it was su_ppo~ed to hasten the healing
process. A commission appomted in t784 by the French
government through the Faculli de Medecine and the
Soci~lc yoyale de Mtdecine, reported that such practices
were exceedinc;ly dangerous. and in nowise pro,·ed the
existence of the magnetic fluid. Dt. Bell a " professor of
animal magnetism" set up a similar institution in England
in 1785. using a large oak baquet.
Bar-Lgura : (Semitic demon ) : Sits on the roofs of house$
and leaps on the inhabitants. People so afflicted are
called d'baregara.
Barqu : A demon in whose keeping was the 6ccret of the
Philosophers' stone.
Barguest, tbe : A goblin or phantom of a mischievous
character, so named from his habit of sitting on ba~ or
gates. It is said that he can make himself visible in the
day time. Rich in the Ettcyclopmdia 111etropolitana relates
a story of a lady. whom he knew, who had been brought
up in the country. She had been passing through the
fields one morning, when a girl, and saw, as she thought,
someone sitting on a stile : however, as she drew near,
it vanished.
Barnaud, Nicholas : A medical doctor of the sixteenth
century who claimed to have discovered the PhHosophers'
Stone. He published a great number of short treatises
on the subject of Alchemy, which are contained in the
third volume of the Thealrum Chimicum of Zetzner, pub-
lished at Strasburg, in 1659.
Baron Cbctcs : (See Busardiar).
Bartholomew : (See Dec).
Baru : Caste of priests. !See Semites.)
Basil : an astrologer. (See Italy).
Basilideaos : A gnostic sect founded by Basi!ides of
Alexandria, who claimed to huve received his esoteric
doctrines from Glaucus, a disciple of the Apostle Peter.
The system had three grades-material, intc!!ectual. and
spiritual, and possessed two allegorical statues, male and
female. The doctrine had many points of resemblance
to that of the Ophites (q.v.), and ran on the lines of j ewish
Kabalism.
Bassanf.lo, James : a Scottish astrologer, the son of the
Laird of Bassantin, in the Mersc, was born in the reign
of James IV.; and, after studying mathematics at the
University of Glasgow, he travelled for farther information
on the Continent. He subsequently went to Paris, where
for some years he taught mathematics in the University.
He returned to Scotland in 1562. The prevailing b~lief
of that age, particularly in France, was a belief in judicial
astrology. In his way home through England, as we
learn from Sir j ames Melville's Memoirs, he met with his
brother, Sir Robert Melville, who was at that time engaged,
on the part of the unfortunate :Mary, in endeavouring to
effect a meeting between her and Elizabeth ; when he
predicted that all his efforts would be in vain ; " for, first,
they will neuer meit togither, and next, there will nevir
be bot disccmbling and secret hattrent (hatred) for a whyle,
and at length captivity and utter wrak for our Quen by
England." ·Melville's answer was, that he could not credit
such news, which he looked upon as " false, ungodly, and
unlawful ; " on which Bassantin replied, " Sa far as Me-
lanthon, wha was a godly thologue, has declared and
written anent the naturall SC}'ences, that are lawfull and
daily red in dyvers Christian Universities : in the quliilkis,
Bat 65 Beaumont
as in all other artis, God gives to some less, to some mau
and clearer knawlcdge than till othirs ; be the quhilk
knawledge I have also that at length, that the kingdom
of England sail of rycht fall to the crown of Scotland, and
that ther are some born at this instant that sa.!l bruik
lands and heritages in England. Bot, alace, it will cost
many their lyves, and many bluidy battailes will be fouchen
first, and the Spaniatris will be helpers, and will take a
part to themselves for their labours." The first part of
Bassa11tin's prediction, which he might very well have
hazarded from what he may have known oi Eli:nbeth's
character and disposition, and al~o from the fact that Mary
was the next heir to the English throne, proved true.
B assantin w;u a zealous Protestant and a supporter of the
Regent Moray. He died in 1568. His principal work
is a Treatise or Discourse on Astronomy, written in French,
which was transbted into Latin by John Tom<esius (M. de
Toumes), and published at Geneva in 1599. He wrote
four other treabses. Although well versed for his time in
what are called the exact sciences, Bassanti~J, or, as his
name is sometimes spclt, BassantoUil, had received no part
of a classical education. Vossius observes, th:tt his Astro-
nomical Discourse was written in very bad French, and
that the author knew " neither Greek nor Latin, but only
Scots." Bassantin's Plaoetary System was that of
Ptolemy.
Bat : There is an Oriental belief that the bat is specially
adapted to occult uses. In the Tyrol it is be~ieved that
the man who wears the left eye of a bat may become in-
visible, and in Hesse he who Wjlars the heart of a bat bound
to his arm with red thread will always be lucky at cards.

Batallle, Dr.: Author of Le Diable au XIX. Siede. Under
the pseudonym of Dr. Hecks he purports to have wit-
nessed the secret rites and orgies of many di<tbolic societies,
but a merely perfunctory examination of his work is suffi-
cient to brand it as wholly an effort of the imagination.
Bathym, also cal!cd Marthim, a duke o>f the Infernal
Regions. He has the appearance of a robust man, says
Wierius, but his body ends in a serpent's tail. He be-
strides a steed of livid colour. He is well versed in the
virtues of herbs and precious stones. He is able to trans-
port men from one place to another with wondrous speed.
Thirty legions obey his behests.
Baton, the Devil's : There is preserved in the marclu:
d' Ancdne, Tolentino, a b,iton which it is said that tho devil
used.
Battle of Loqulfer, The : a talc in'corporatcd in the
Charlemagne saga, supposed to have been written about
the twelfth century. Its hero is Renouart, the giant
brother-in-law of William of Orange, and the events take
place on the sea. Renouart and hls barons are on the
shore at Porpaillart, when a Saracen fle~t is seen. He is
persuaded to enter one of the ships, which immediately
set sail ; and he is told by Isembert, a hideous monster,
that the Saracens mean to flay hlm alive. Renouart,
armed only with a huge bar of wood, kills this creature,
and makes the Saracens let him go, while they return to
their >:>wn country. It is arranged that Renouart will
fight one Loquifer, a fairy giant and leader of the Saracens ;
and on the issue of this combat the war will depend. They
meet on an island near Porpaillart. Loquifer is in pos-
session of a magical balm, which heals all his wounds im-
mediately, and is concealed in his club; but Renouart,
who is assisted by angel~. at length succeed.~ in depriving
Loquifcr of his club, so that his strength departs. Renouart
slays hlm, and the devil carries off his soul. The romance
goes on to tell of a duel between William of Orange and
Desrame, Renouart's father, in which the latter is slain.
Renouart is comforted by fairies, who bear hlm to Avalon
where he has many adventures. He is finally wrecked
but is rescued by mermaids, and awakes to find himself
on the sands at Porpaillart, from whlch spot he had been
taken to Avalon.
Bauer, George : who Latinized his name (a boor or hus-
bandman) into " Agricola," was born in the province of
1\tisnia, in 1494. An able and industrious man, he acquired
a considerable knowledge of the principles of medicine,
which led him, as it led his contemporaries, to search for
the elixir vit~ and the Philosopher's Stone. A treatise
on these interesting subjects, which be published at Cologne
in 1531, secured him the favour of Duke Maurice of Saxony,
who appointed him the superintendent of 1m silver-mines
at Chemnitz. In this post he obtained a practical ac-
quaintance with the properties of metals which dissipated
his wild notions of their pos~ible transmutation into gold ;
but if he abandoned one superstition he adopted another,
and from the legendl> of the miners imbibed a belief in the
existence of ~ood and evil ~pirits in the bowels of the earth,
and in the creation of explosive gases and fire-damp by
the malicious agency of the latter. Bauer died in 1555.
Bave : Daughter of the wi7.ard Calatin. She figures in
the famous Irish legend The Cattle Raid of Quelgny. By
taking the form of one of Niam's handmaids she succeeded
in enticing her away from Cuchulin, and led her forth
to wander in the woods.
Bayemon : The grimoire of Pope Honorius gives this
name as that of a powerful demon whom it addresse~ as
monarch of the western parts of the Infernal Regions. To
him the followin~ invocation is addressed : " 0 King
Bayemon, most m1ghty, who reigneth towards the western
parts, I call upon thee and invoke thy name in the name
of the Divinity. I command thee in the name of the Most
High to present thyself before this circle, thee and the other
spirits who arc thy subjects, in the name of Passiel and
Rosus, for the purpose of replying to all that which I de-
mand of thee. If thou dost not come I will torment thee
with a sword of heavenly fire. I will augment thy pains
and bum thee. Obey, 0 KingBayemon.
Beallngs BeUs : In February, 1834, a mysteriou<; outbreak
of bell-ringing was heard at the residence of i\lajor Moor,
F.R.S.,- Bealings, ncar Woodbridge, Suffolk. From the
znd of February to the 27th of ll!arcb the bells of the house
rang at frequent intervals, and without any visible agency.
The Major meanwhile took careful note of the condition
of the atmosphere, state of the v.oires, and any physical
cause which might affect the bells, but, as Mr. Podmore
justly points out, he omitted to take precautions against
trickery in hls own household, and has not even left on
record the names of its members, or any facts concerning
them.
Beans : A forbidden article of diet. The consumption
of beans was prohibited by Pythagoras and Plato to those
who desire veracious dreams, as they tend to inflate ; and
for the purpose of truthful dreaming, the animal nature
must be made to lie quiet. Cicero, however, laughs at
this discipline, asking if 1t be the stomach and not the mind
with which one dreams ?
Bearded Demon : The demon who teaches the secret
of the Philosophers' Stone. He is but little knowJl. The
demon barbu is not to be confused with Barbatos, a great
and powerful demon who is a duke in Hades, though not
a philosopher ; nor with Barbas, who is interested in
mechanics. It is said that the bearded demon is so called
on account of his remarkable beard.
Beaumont, .John : Author of a Treatise 011 Spirits, Ap-
paritioltS, etc., published in 1705. He is described as "a
man of•hypochondriacal disposition, with a considerable
degree of reading, but with a strong bias 'to credulity."
Labouring under this allect.ion, he saw hundreds of
BeAumont 66 Belloc
imaginary men and women about him, though, as he adds.
he never saw anything in the night-time. unless by fire or
candlelight, or in the moonshine-.. '· I had two spirits,"
he says, " who constantly attended me, night and day,
for above three months together, who called each other
by their names ; and several spirits would cal! at my
chamber door, and ask whether such soirits lived there,
and they wQ}lld answer they did. As fo"r the other spirits
that attended me, I heard none of their names mentioned
only I asked one spirit, which came for some nights to-
gether, a,nd rung a little bell in my ear, what his name was,
who answered A riel.· The two spirits that constantly
attended myself appeared both in women's habit, they
being of a brown complexion, about three feet in stature;
they had both black loose net-work gowns, tied with a
black s"-Sh about the middle, and within the net-work
appeared a gown of a golden colour, with somewhat of a
light striking througlt it. Their heads were not dressed
in top-knots, but they had white linen caps on, with lace
on them about three fin_$ers' breadth, and over it they
had a black loose net-work hood."
" I would not," he says, " for the whole world, undt>rgo
what I have undergone, upon spirits coming twice to me ;
their first coming was most dreadful to me, the thing being
then altogether new, ~nd conse9_uently most surprising,
though at the first commg they d1d not appear to me but
only called to me at my chamber-windows, rung belL<;,
sung to me, and played on music, etc.; but the last coming
also carried terror enough ; for when they came, being
only fi·Je in number, the two women before mentioned,
and three men (though afterwards there came hundreds),
they told me they would kill me if I told any person in
the house of their being there, which J?Ut me in some con-
sternation ; and I made a servant Sit up with me four
nights in my chamber, before a fire, it being in the Christ-
mas holiday~. telling no person of their being there. One
of these spirits, in women's dress, lay down upon the bed
by me every night; and told me, if I slept, the spirits
would kill me, which kept me waking for three nights.
In the meantime, a near relation of mine went (though
unknown to me) to a physician of my acquaintance, de-
siring him to prescribe me somewhat for sleeping, which
he did, and a sleeping potion was brought me ; but I set
it by, being very desirous and inclined to sleep without
it. The fourth night I could hardly forbear sleeping; but
the spirit, lying on the bed by me, told me again, I should
be killed if I slept ; whereupon I rose and ~at by the fireside,
and in a while returned to my bed ; and so I did a third
time, but was still threatened as before ; whereupon I grew
impatient, and asked the spirits what they would have ?
Told them I had done the part of a Christian, in humbling
myself to God, and feared them not ; and rose from my
bed. took a cane, and knocked at the c~iling of my chamber,
a near relation of mine then lying over me, who presently
rose and came down to me about two o'clock in the morn-
ing, to whom I said, " You have seen me disturbed these
four days past, and that I have not slept : the occasion
of it was, that five spirits, which arc now in the room with
me, have threatened to kill me if I told any person of their
being here, or iiI slept ; but I am not able to forbear sleep-
ing longer, and acquaint you with it, and now stand in
defiance of them ; and thus 1 exerted myself about them
and notwithstanding their continued threats I slept very
well the next night, and continued to do so, though they
continued with me above three months, day and night."
Beausoleil, Jean du Cbatelot, Baron de : German min·
eralogist and alchemist, who lived during the first half of
the seventeenth century. He travelled over most European
countries looking for metals with the aid of a divining ring.
In 1626 his instruments were seized under tht pretext that
they were bewitched, and he himself prisoned in the Bas-
tille, where he died in 1645· ln 1617 he published a work
entitled Diorisimts, id est defit~itis t•erae philisophia de
materia prima lapidis plrilosophalis. Bea~lsoleil was the
greatest of French metallurgists of his time.
Bechard : A demon alluded to in the Key of Solor.zon as
having pO\'I'Cr over the winds and the tempests. He makes
hail, thunder and rain.
Bed : Graham's Magnetic : A magnetic contrivance made
use of by one Graham, physician and magnctist of Edin-
burgh. His who!e house, which he termed the Temple of
Hygeia, wl)s of great magnificence, but particularly did
splendour prevail in the room wherein was set the magnetic
bed. The bed itself rested on ~i-. tra:1sparent pillar~ ; the
mattresses were soaked with oriental perfumes; the bcd-
cloth~s were of satin, in tints of purple and sky-blue. A
healing stream of magnetism, l:.S well as fragrant and
strengthening medicines. were introduced into the sleeping
apartment through glass tubes and cylinders. To these
attrnctions were added the soft strains of hidden flutes,
harmonicon~. and a large organ. P.crmission to use this
celestial couch, so sootl1ing to shattered nen·es. was ac-
corded only tt> those who sent a written application to its
owner, inclosing £so sterling.
Bees : It is maintained by certain demonologists that
if a sorceres~ ate a queen-bee before being captured, she
would be able to sustain her trial and tortures without
making a confession. In some parts of Brittany it is
claimed for these insects that they are very sensitive to
the fortunes and misfortunes of their master, and will not
thrive unless he is careful to tic a piece of black cloth to
the hive when a death occurs in the family, and a piece
of red cloth when there is any occasion of rejoicing. So-
linus writes that t here are no bees in Ireland, and even
if a little Irish earth be taken to another country, and
spread about the hives, the bees will be forced to abandon
the place, so htal to them is the earth of Ireland. The
same story is found in the 01 igi11es of Isodore. "~Iu~t
we seek," says Lebrun, ··the source of this calumny of
Irish earth ? Xo ; for it is sufficient to say that it is a
fable, and that many ~cs :ne to be found in Ireland."
Belin, Albert : A Benedictine, born at Besan~on in 1610.
His principal works arc a treaty on talismans and a dis-
sertation upon astral figures, published at Paris in 1671,
and again in 1709. He also wrote Sympathetic Powder
justified, an alchemical work, and Advent11res of an 1tn-
ktzown philosopher i11 the search for a1zd the mamtfacture of
the Philosopher'r Stone. This latter work is divided into
four books and speaks very clearly of the manner in
which the ~tone is made. (Paris, 1664 and 1674),

Belli Paaro : A secret society of Liberia, Africa, the cult
of which con~ists in a description of brotherhood with
departed spirits. Dapper, an early autht>r, sayr. C){ t'!lis
society : " They have also another custom which they
call Belli Paaro, of which they say it is a death,a new birth
and an incorporation in the community of spirits or soul
with whom the common folk associate in the bush, and
help to eat the offerings prepared for the spirits." This
description is far from clear, but it is obvious enough that
those who join the society de~ire to be regarded as spirit-
ua!iscd, or as having died and having been brought to life
again ; and that their society is notning more than a con-
fraternity of all those who have passed through this
training in co:umon.
Belloc, Jeanne : A sorceress of the district of Labour,
in France, who in the reign of Henry IV. was indicted for
sorceryat the age of 84 yoars. In answer to Pierre Delancre
Belocolus 67 Bermechobus
who interrogated her, she stated that she commenced
to repair to the sabbatic meetings of Satan in the winter
of the year 1609, that she was thert• presented to the Devil
who kissed her, a mark of approbation which he bestowed
upon the greatest sorcerers only. She related that the
Sabbath was a species of bal masque, to wltich some came
~n their _ordinary forms. whilst others joined the dance
1n the gwse of dogs cats, donkeys, pigs and other animals.
Beloeolus : A white stone ";th a black pupil, said to
render its bearer invisible in a field of battle.
Belomancy : The method of divination by arrows, dates
as far back as the age ot the Chaldeans. It existed among
the Creeks, and still later among the Arabians. The
manner in which the latter practised it is de~cribed Else-
where. and they continued 1ts use though forbidden by
the Koran. Another method deserves mention. This
was to throw a certain number of arrows into the air, and
the direction in which the arrow inclined as it fell, pointed
out the course to be taken by the inquirer. Divination
by arrows is the same in principle as Rhabdomancy {q.v.).
Belpbegor : The demon of discoveries and ingenious
inventions. He appears always in the shape of a young
woman. The :i\foabitcs, who called him Baalphegor, adored
him on Mount Phegor. He it is who bestows riches.
Benedict IX. : At a time when the papacy was much abused
-about the tenth and eleventh centuries-the papal crown
was more than once offered for sale. Thus the office fell
into the hands of a high and ambitious family who held it
for a boy of twelv~Be1zedict IX. As he srew older the
boy lost no opportunity of dis~racing his position by hls
depraved mode of life. But, like his predecessors in the
papal chair, he excelled in sorcery and various forms of
magic. One of the most curious stories concerning rum
tells bow he made the Roman matrons follow him over
hlll and dale, through forests and across rivers, by the
charm of his magic, as though he were a sort of Pied Piper.
Benemmerlnnen : Hebrew witches who haunt women in
childbirth for the purpose of stealing new-born infants.
Benjees, The: A people of the East Indies, given over to
the worship· of the Devil ; and whose temples and pagodas
are filled ·with horrible statues of him. The king of Calicut
had a temple wholly filled with a\\ful figures of the devil,
and which was lighted only with the gleam of many lamps.
In the centre was a copper throne, on which was seated a
devil, made of the same metal, with a large tiara on his
head, three huge horns and four others which come out
of his forehead. On his tongue ~nd in hil hand were two
figures-soul~. which the Indians say, he s preparing to
devour.
Bensozla : According to Don Martin 10 hls Religion de
Gatilois, " chief dcvi!ess " of a certain Sabbatic meeting
held in France in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.
She was, he says, the Diana of the ancient Gauls, and was
also called Nocticula, Herodias. and " The Moon." One
finds in the manuscripts of the church at Couserans. that
the ladies of the fourteenth century were said to go on
horseback to the nocturnal revelries of Bensoz.ia. All of
them were forced to inscribe their names in a Sabbatic
catalogue along with those of the sorcerers proper, and
after this ceremony they believed themselves to be fairies.
There was found at Montmorillon in Poitou, in the
eighteenth century, a portion of an ancient temple, a bas-
relief with the fi~ur:c of a naked woman carved upon it,
and it is not unbkely, thinks Collin de Plancy, that this
figure was the original deity of the Be11sozia cult.
Beowulf : an Anglo-Saxon saga of great interest. The
events in this poem probably took place about the fifth
century. Beowulf, himself, was most likely one of the
Sons of Light or :i\:Ien of the Sun, whose business it "\\'35 to
n ght the powers of darkness until they themselves fell.
It is related in tlus legend how Beowulf fought the monster,
Gre:ndcl, and succeeded in defeating him-the giant es~
capmg only by leaving his arm in Beowulf's grip. But
qrendel's mother, a mer-woman, came to revenge him
and slew many people. Beowulf, hearing of this, took
up the quarrel, ar.d diving to the bottom of the sea, where
her palace lay, killed her after a fierce fight. Later on
B.eowulf was made regent of Cothland, and afterwards
king, and he reigned for about forty years. He was poi-
soned.by the fangs of a dragon during a mighty struggle,
-:.r:d dted from the effects. He was buried on a hill named
Hronesnas, and was deeply mourned by his people.
Berande : A sorcere~s burnt at )1aubcc, in France, in 1577.
She was confronted by a damsel whom she accused of
sorcery, which the girl denied, whereat the beldame ex-
claimed, " Dost thou not remember how at the last dance
at lhe Croix du Pate, thou didst carry a pot of poison ? "
The damsel at thls confessed, and was burnt along with
her accuser.
Bereschith : Universal Gene~is, one of the two parts into
which the Kabala was divided by the rabbins. •
Berlgard of Plsa : Alchemist. (1578 ? - 1664). Owing
to his residing for many years at Pisa, this alchemist is
commonly known by the apr-e!lation gh·en above ; but
in reality he was not an Italian but a Frenchman, and his•
name was Claude Guillermet de Birigard, or, as it is some-
times spelt, Bea1tregard. The date of his birth i~ uncertain,
some authorities assigning it to 1578, and others placing
it considerably later; but they are agreed in saying that
Moulins was his native town, and that, while a young man,
he evinced a keen Jove for science in its various branches,
and began to dabble in alchemy. He appears to have
studied for a while at the Sorbonne, at Paris; and, having
acquired some fame there on account of .his erudition, he
was appointed professor of natural philosophy at the Uni-
versity of Pisa. This post he held until the year 1640,
whereupon he was assigned an analogous position at Padua,
and it was probably in the 1;-.ttcr town that his death oc-
curred in 1664. His most i:uportant contribution to
scientific literature is Dubitafiones i11 Dialogum Ealiltai
pro Terrta immobilitate, a quarto published at Florence
in 163z; but he was likewise author of Circtdrts Pisa11us,
issued at Udine in 1643. wherein he concerns himself chiefly
with commenting on ·Aristotle's ideas on physics. Beri-
garde's writings arc virtually forgotten nowadays, but
they are interesting as documents illustrating the progress
of scientific knowledge throughout the seventeenth
century.
Berkeley, Old Woman of : (See England.)
Bermechobus : The supposed writings of St. l\lethodius of
Olympus (martyred 311 A.D.) or the saint of the same
name who was Patriarch of Constantinople and who died
in 846. The real name of the work is Bea-Methodius, a
contraction for Beatus P.1ethodivo, which was misprinted
" Bermechobus." The work is of the nature of a pro~
phetic Apocalypse, and foretells the history of the world.
It was handed down by the Gnostics and wa~ printed in
the Liber Mirabilis (q.v.). There are no grounds, however.
for the supposition that the work should be referred to
either of the saints above mentioned. It recounts how
Seth sought a new country in the cast and came to the
country of the initiate!". and hC>w the children of Cain in-
stituted a sy~tem of black magic in India. The author
identifies the Ishmaelite~ with those tribe~ who overthrew
tbe Roman power. and tells of a poworful northern people
whose reign will be over-turned by Anti-Christ. A uni-
versal kingdom will thereafter be founded, governed by
a prince of French blood, after which a prolonged period
of justice will supervene.

Bernheim : (S~~ Hypnotism.)
Bertbome du Lignon : called Champagnat, a sorcerer brought
to trial at Montmorillon, in Poitou, in 1599. He confessed
that his father had taken him to the Sabbath of the sor-
ceron in his youth. that he had promised the Devil his soul
and his body, that His Satanic Majesty had shown him
marks of his favour, and that he had even visited him in
prison on the previous night. He further confessed
having slain several porsoos and beasts with the magical
powders given him by the Enemy of )fankind.

Beryl : Beryl, said to preserve weddej love, and to be a good
medium for magical vision.
Bezoar : (red). A precious stoM suppo.>ed to be possessed
of magical properties, and found in the bo.iie~ of certain
animals. At one time the<;e stones would fetch ten times
their weight in gold, being used as a remedy against poi~ou
and contagion ; and for this purpose they were both taken
internally, and worn rouud the neck. It is said that there
are nine varieties of bezoar. differing grc1tly in composition ;
but they may be generally divided into those which consist
mainly of mineral and those w!1ich consist of organic matter.
A strange origin was assigned to this stone by some of the
early naturalists. It is said that the oriental stags when
oppressed with years fed upon serpents, which renewed
their youth. In order to counteract the poison which was
absorbed into their system. they plunged into a running
stream keeping their heads only above water. This caused
a viscous ftuid to be distilled from their eyes, which was
indurated by the heat of the sun, and formed the
betoar.

Bible or the Devtl : This Wa.!' without doubt a grimoire (q.v.)
or some such work. But Delancre say3 that the Devil
informed sorcerers that he possassed a bible consisting of
sacred books, having a theology of its own, which was
dilated upon by various professors. One great magician,
continues Delancre, who was brought before the Parlia-
ment of Paris, avowed that there dwelt at Toledo sixty-
three masters in the faculty of ~!agic who took for their
text-book the Devil's Bible.
Bibliomaney : A method of discovering whether or not a
person was innocent of sorcery, by weighing him against
the great Bible in the Church. If the person we:ghe1 les.;;
than the Bible, he wa~ innocent. (See Witchcraft.)
Bifrant : A little-known demon. chief of a legion who entered
the body of one Denise de Ia Caille (q.v.) and who was
obliged to sign with his claws the proces verbal of exorcisms.
Bifrons : A demon of monstrous guise who, according to
\Vierius, often took the form of a man well versed in As-
trology and planetary influences. He excels in geometry,
is acquainted with the virtue.;; of herbs, preciou; stones
and plants, and it is said that he is able to transport corpses
from one place to another. He it is also who lights the
strange corp~e-!ights above the tombs of the dead. Twenty
six of the infernal regions obey his behests.
Blgois or Blgotls : A sorcerer of Tuscany who, it is said,
composed a learned work on the nature of prognostications,
especially those connected with thunder and lightning.
Tile book is said to be irretrievably lost. It is thought that
Bigois is the same as Ba.goe (q.v.), a sibly of Erithryea,
but this is merely of the nature of surmise.
Blnab : In the supreme triangle of the Kabala the three sides
are reason, which they name !<.ether: necessity, Chochmah ;
and liberty, Binah.
Biragues, Flaminfo de : Author of an infernal-facetious work
entitled l'£,fer de Ia meYe Cardi11e, which treats of the
dreadful ba~t!e in H_ell on th~ occasion of the marriage of
Cex:berus w1th Cardme (Pans, 1585 and 1597.) It is a
sabre on the demonography of the times. Didot reprinted
the work in 1793. The author was a nephew of a Chan-
cellor of France, Rene de Biragues.
Bird; : It is a common belief among savage tribes that the
souh of the dead are conveyed to the land of the hereafter
by ~ir~s. Among some West African peoples, for instance,
a blrd IS bound to the body of the deceased and then sacri·
ficed, so that it may carry the man's soul to the after-world.
The Bagos also offer up a bird on the corpse of a deceased
perso:t for the same reason. The South Sea Islanders,
again, bury their dead in coffins shaped like the bird which
is to bear away their spirits, while the natives of Borneo
represent Tempon-Tclon's Ship of the Dead (q.v.} as having
the form of a bird. The Indian tribes of Xorth-\\'est
America have rattles shaped like ravens, with a lar~e face
painted on the breast. The probable significance 1s that
the raven is to carry the disembodied soul to the region of
the sun.
Birog : A Druidess of Irish legendary origin. She it was
who, by her magic, brought Kian and Ethlinn together.
Birraark: Australian necromancers. (Sec Necromancy.)
Biscar, Jeanette : A sorceress of the district' of Labour in
France, who was transported to the witches' Sabbath by
the Devil in the form of a goat. As a reward she was
suspended in mid-air head downwards.
Biselaveret : The name of the were-wolf (q.v.) in Brittany.
It is believed to be a human being, transformed by magic
into a fearsome man-devouring beast, which roams about
the woods, seeking whom it may slay.
Bltru : Otherwist called Sytry, a great Prince of Hell, accord-
ing to the demonographer Wierius. He appeared in the
form of a leopard with the wings of a griffin. But when
he adopted a human appearance for the nonce it was in-
variably one of great beauty. It is he who awakes lust
in the human heart. Seventy legions obey his commands.
Bitumen, in l\tagic : Bitumen was greatly used in magical
practices. Images for the purpose of sympathetic magic
were often made of this substance; and it was used in the
ceremonies for the cleansing of houses in which any un-
cleanness had appeared- being spread on the floor like clay.
Black Earth: (See Philosopher's Stone.)
Black Hen, Fast or The: In Hungary and the adjacent
countries it is believed that whoever has been robbed and
wishes to discover the thief must take a black hen and along
with it fast strictly for nine Fridays. The thief will then
either return the plunder or die. This is called " taking
up a black fast " against anyone. A great deal of lore
concerning black hens may be found in the works of Guber-
natis and Friedrich.
Black Magic: Middle Ages. Black ii<Iagic as practised in
medi.eval times may be defined as the use of supernatural
knowledge for the purposes of evil. the invocation of
diabolic and infernal powers that they may become the
s!.ave.;; and emissaries of man's will; in short, a perversion
of legitimate mystic science. This art and its attendant
practices can be traced from the time of the ancient
Egyptians and Persians, from the Greeks and Hebrews to
the period when it reached its apogee in the ?~fiddle Ages,
thus forming an unbroken chain; for in medi<nval magic
may be found the perpetuation of the popular rites of
paganism-the anc1ent gods had become devils, their
mysteries orgies, their worship sorcery.
Some historians have tried to trace the areas in E urope
most affected by these devilish practices. Spain is said
to have excelled all in infamy, to have plumbed the depths
of the abyss. The south of France next became a hotbed
of sorcery, whence it branched northwards to Paris and the
Black Magic 69
countries and islands beyond, southward to Italy, finally
extending into tbe Tyrol and Germany.
In Black Magic human perversity found the means of
mini~tering to its most terrible demands and the possible
attainment of its darkest imaginings. To gain limitless
power over god, demon and man ; for personal aggrandise-
ment and glormcation ; to cheat, trick and mock ; to
~ratify base appetites; to aid religious bigotry and jealous-
les; to satisfy pri,·ate and public enmities; to further
political intrigue ; to encompass disease, calamity and
death-these were the ends and aims of Black 1i1agic
and its followers.
So widespread, so intense was the belief in the Powers
of Evil that it may truly be said the Devil reigned supreme,
if the strength and fervour of a universal fear be weighed
against the weak and wavering manifestations of love and
goodwill, peace and charity enjoined by religion in t he
worship of God.
Under the- influence of this belief the world becarr.e. to
the mind and imagination of man a placeof dread. At set
of sun, at midnight, in twilight of dawn and eve, the legions
of evil were abroad on their mission of terror. A running
stream, a lake, or thick forest, held each its horde of
malevolent spirits lying in wait for the lonely wayfarer,
while tho churchyard close to the House of> God, the
place of the gallows away from the habitation of man,
the pestilential marsh, wilderness and mysterious cavern,
the barren slopes and summits of mountains, were the
dread meeting-places of the Devil and his myrmidons,
the scenes of their infamous orgies, the temples of their
blasphemous rites.
And the night was troubled by evil and ominous winds
blowing from the Netherworld, heavy with the beating of
the innumerable wings of the birds of ill-omen presaging
woe; the darkness was faintly lit by the flitting phosphores-
cent forms ofsepulchral larva:, waiting to batten on the souls
and bodies of man; of stryges infesting the tombs and dese-
crating the dead; of incubi and succubi surrounding the
homes of the living to bring dishonour and madness to sleep-
ing man and woman and beget monstrous and myriad life ;
of ravenous vampires in search of victims for their feast
of blood. Moon and stars might illumine the darkness,
but in their beams were spells and enchantments, in their
rising and waning the inexorable workings of Fate, while
against their light could be seen the dishevelled or naked
forms of warlock and witch passing overhead to their dia-
bolical Sabbaths. The familiar happenings and actions
of life might be nothing but the machinations of sorcery-
to eat and drink might bo to swallow evil; to look upon
beauty in any form, the sesame to malign influence ; to
laugh, but to echo infernal mockery and mirth.
In this fruitful soil of superstition and grotesque ignor·
ance, Black Magic sowed and reaped its terrible harvest
of evil, persecution, madness and death. Such a stato of
mind must, of necessity, have induced a weakness of will
and imagination specially prone to the influence of hyp-
notic suggestion by a stronger will, and even more ready
to fall an easy prey to self-hypnotism, which must have
often been the result of such an atmosphere of foreboding
and dread.
The simplest ailments or most revolting diseases, cata-
leps¥ and somnambulism, hysteria, and insanity, all these
were traced to the rower of Black Magic, caused through
the conjurations o sorcery. It followed that curative
medicine was also a branch of magic, not a rational science.
the cures being nothing if not fantastic in the last degree
-incantations and exorcisms, amulets and talismans of
precious stones, metals or weird medicaments rendered
powerful by spells; philtres and enchanted drinks, the
cure of epilepsy by buried peachblossoms, and though in
Black Magic
the use of herbs and chemicals was laid the foundation of
the curative science of to-day, it was more for their en-
chanted and symbolic significance that they were pre-
scribed by the magicians.
History shows us that the followers of the Black Art
swarmed everywhere. In this fraternity as in others there
were grades. from the pretenders, charlatans and diviners
of the common people, to the various secret societies and
orders of initiates, amongst whom were kings and queens.
and popes, dignitaries of church and state, where the know-
ledge and ritual were carelully cherished and preserved
in manuscripts, some of which are extant at the present
day, ancient grimoires (q.v.), variously termed the Black,
the Red, the Great Grimoire, each full of weird rites,
formul;e and conjurations, evocations of evil malice and
lust in the names of barbaric deities ; charms and be-
witchments clothed in incomprehensible jargon, and
ceremonial processes for the fulfilment of imprecations of
misfortune, calamity, sin and death.
The deity who was worshipped, whose powers were
invoked in the practice of Black Magic, was the Source and
Creator of Evil, Satanas, Belial, the Devil, a direct des-
cendant of the Egyptian Set, the Persian Ahriman, the
Python of the Greeks, the Jewish Serpent, Baphomet of
the Templars, the Coat-deity of the "Witches' Sabbath.
He was said to have the head and legs of a goat, and the
breasts of a woman.
To his followers he was known by many names, among
theso being debased names of forgotten deities, also the
Black One, the Black He-goat, the Black Raven, the Dog,
the Wolf and Snake, the Dragon, the Hell-hound, Hell-
hand, and Hell-bolt. His transformations were unlimited,
as is indicated by many of his names; oth~r favourite and
familiar forms were a cat, a mouse, a toad, or a worm,
or again, the human form, especi:l!ly as a young and hand-
some man when on his amorous adventures. The signs
by which he might be identified, though not invariably,
were the cloven hoof, the goat's beard, cock's feathers, or
ox's tail.
In all his grotesquery are embedded ancient mysteries
and their symbols, the detritus of dead faiths and faded
civilizations. The Creek Pan with the goat limbs mas-
querades as the Devil, also the goat as emblematic of
fire and symbol of generation, and perhaps traces of the
Jewish tradition where two goats were taken, one pure,
the other impure, the first offered as sacrifice in expiation
of sin, the other, the impure burdened with sins by impre-
cation and driven into the wilderness, in short, the scape-
goat. In the Hebrew Kabala, Satan's name is that of
Jehovah reversed. He is not a devil, but the negation
of deity.
Beneath the Devil's sway were numberless hordes and
legions of domons and spirits, ready and able to procure
and work any and every evil or disaster the mind of man
might conceive and desire. In one Grimoire it tells of
nine orders of evil spirits, these being False Gods, Lying
Spirits, Vessels of Iniquity, Revenge led by Asmodeus,
Delude'rs by the Serpent, Turbulents by Merigum, Furies
by Apollyon, Calumniators by Astaroth, and Tempters
by Mammon. These demons a~ain a;re named separately,
the meaning of each name 1ndicating the possessor's
capacity, such as destroyer, devastator, tumult, ravage,
and so forth.
Again each earthly vice and calamity was personUied
b_y a demon, Moloch, who devours infants ; Nisroch, god
of hatred, despair, fatality; Astarte, Lilith and Astaroth,
deities of debauchery and abortion ; Adramelek, of murder,
and Belial, of red anarchy.
According to the Grimoires, the rites and rules are
multifarious, each demon demanding special invocatiDn
Black Magic 70
and procedure. The end5 that may be obtained by these
means are sufficiently indicated in the headings of the
chapters : To take poss::ssion of <!ll kinds of treasure ;
to like in .opulence ; to ruin possessions ; to demolish
buildings and strongholds ; to cause armed men to appear ;
to e"cite every description of hatred, discord, failure and
vengeance; to excite tempests ; to excite love in a ";rgin,
in a married person ; to procure adulteries ; to cause
enchanted mu!'ic and l:lscivious dances to appear ; to
learn all secrets from those of Yenus to !liars; to render
onescll invisible; to fly in the air and travel; to operate
under water for twenty-four hours ; to open every ldnd
of lock '1\;thout a key, without noise and thus gain en-
trance to prison, larder or chamel-house; to inr.oculate
the walls of houses with pbguc and disease ; to bind fa-
miliar spirits; to cause a dead .body to revive; to transform
one's self; to transform men into animals o= animals into
men.
These rites fell under the classification of divination,
bewitchments and necromancy. The first named was
carried out by magical readings of fire, smoke, water or
blood ; by letters of names, numbers, symbols, arrange-
ments of dots ; by lines of hand or finger nails; by birds
and their flight or their entrails ; by dice or cards, rings
or mirrors.
Bewitchments were carried out by means of n:lils, ani-
mals, toads or waxen figures and mostly to bring about
suffering or death. In the first method nails were conse-
crated to evil by spells and in,·ocations, then nailed cress-
wise above the imprint of the feet of the one who is destined
for torment. The next was by selection of some animal
supposed to resemble the intended victim and attaching
to it some of his hair or garments. They gave it the name
and then proceeded to torture it, in.whole or part according
to the end desired, by driving nails, red-hot pins and thorns
into the body to the rhythm of muttered maledictions.
For like purpose a fat toad was often selected, baptised,
made to swallow a host, both consecrated and execrated,
tied with hairs of the victim upon which the sorcerer bad
previously spat, and finally buried at the threshold of the
be,~;tched one's door, whence it issued as nightmare and
vampire for his undoing.
The last and most favoured method was by the use of
waxen images. Into the wax was mbced baptismal oil
and ash of consecrated hosts. and out of this was fashioned
a figure resc:nbling the one to be bewitched. It was then
baptised, receiving the persons name in full; received
the Sacraments, and next subjected to curses, torture by
knives or fire; then finally stabbed to the heart. It was
also possible to bewitch a person by insufflation, breathing
upon them, and so causing a heaviness of their will and
corresponding comp!.iance to the sorcerer.
Necromancy (q.v.) was lh~ rai~ing of the dead by evoca-
tions and sacrilegious rites, for the customary purpores
of evil. The scene of operation might be about pits filled
with blood and rescmblmg a s~amblt.s, in a darkened and
suffocating room, b a churchyard or beneath swinging
gibbets, and the number of ghosts so summoned and gal-
vanized into life might be one of legion.
For whatever end, the procedure us'.lally included prof-
anation of Christian ritual, such as diabolical masses and
administration of polluted sacrcments to animals and
reptilef ; bloody sacrifices of animals, often of children ;
of orgia~tic dances, generally of circular formation, such
as that of the Witches' Sabbath in which undreamed-of
evil and abominations, all distortions and monstrosities
of reality and imagination took part, to end in a nightmare
of obscene madness.
For paraphernalia and accessories the sorcerers ~coured
the world and the imaginl!tion and mind of mao, bending
Black Itiagie
all things. beautiful or horrible to their service. The
different planets ruled O\'er certain objects and states and
invocations, for such were of great potency if delivered
under their auspices. Mars favoured wars and strife,
Venus love, Jupiter ambition and intrigue, Saturn male-
diction and death.
Vestments and symbols proper to the occasion must be
donned. The electric furs of the panther, lynx and cat
added their quota of influence to the ceremonial. Colours
also must be observed and suitable ornaments. For opera-
tions of vengeance the robe must be the hue of leaping
flame, or rust and blood, with belt and bracelets of steel,
and crow:t of rue and wormwood. Blue, Green and Rose
were the colours for amorous incantations ; whilst for
the encompassing of death black must be worn, with belt
of lead and wreath of cypress, amid loathsome incense of
sulphur and assafc:ctida.
Precious stones and metals also added their influence to
the spells. Geometrical figures, stars, pentagrams, columns,
triangles, were used ; also herbs. such as belladonna and
a~safretida ; flowers, honeysuckle, being the witches'
ladder, the arum, deadly nightshade and black poppies ;
distillation~ and philtres composed of the virus of loath-
some diseases. venom of reptiles, secretions of animals,
poisonous sap and fungi and fruits, such as the fatal man-
chineel, pulverised flint, impure ashes and human blood.
Amulets and talismans were made of the skins of criminals,
\nought from the skulls of banged men, or ornament!!
rifled from corpses and thus of special virtue, or the pared
nails of an executed thief.
To make themselves invisible the sorcerers used an
unguent compounded from the ir.cinerated bodies of
new-born infants and mixed with the blood of night-birds.
For personal preparation a fast of fifteen days was observed.
\Vhen that was past, it was necessary to get drunk every
five days, after sundown, on wine in which poppies and
hemp bad been steeped.
For the actual rites the light must be that of candles
made from the fat of corpses and fashioned in the form of
a cross ; the bowls to be of skulls, those of parricides being
of greatest virtue ; the fires must be fed with cypress
branches. with the wood of desecrated crucifixes and blood-
stained gibbets ; the magic fork fashioned of hazel or
almond, severed at one blow ; the ceremonial cloth to be
woven by a prostitute, whilst round about the mystic
circle must be traced \dth the ember~ of a polluted cross.
Another potent instrument of magic w.:s the mandragore
to be unearthed from beneath gallows where corpses are
suspended, by a dog tied to the plant. The dog is killed
by a mortal blow after which its soul will pass into the
fantastic root, attracting also that of the hanged man.
The history of the :lliddle Ages is shot through with the
shadows cast by this terrible belief in Black 111a~ic. Mach-
inations and counter-machinations in which church and
state, rich and poor, learned and igoor:~ont wete alike in-
volved ; persecutions and prosecutions where the persecutor
and judge often met the fate they dealt to the victim and
condemned-a dreadful phantasmagoria and procession
where we may fiDd the haughty Templars, the blood-stained
Gilles de Laval, the original of Bluebeard ; Catherine de
Medici and Marshals of France ; pope~. princes and priests.
In literature also we find its trace, in weird legends and
monstrous tales ; in stories of spells and enchantments;
in the tale of Dr. Fau!tus and hi~ pact with the De,;!, his
pleasures and their penalty when his soul must needs pass
down to Hell in forfeit ; we may find its traces in lewd
verses and songs. Art, too, yields her testimony to the
infernal influence in pictures, sculptures and carvings,
decorating palace and cathedral ; where we may find the
Devil's likeness peeping out from carven screen and stall,

grinning and leering f~om niche and corner, and clustering

mancy, etc.)
Black Mass : It is known from the confessions of witches
sorcerers that the devil also has mass said at his Sabbath.
Pierre Aupetit, an apostate priest of the village of Fossas,
in Limousine, was burned for having celebrated the my~­
terics of the Devi!'s mass. Instead of speaking the holy
words of consecration the frequenters of the Sabbath !aid :
" Beelzebub, Beelzebub, Beelzebub." The devil in the
shape of a butterfly, flew round those who were celebrating
the mass, and who ate a black host, wrjch they were obliged
to chew before swallowing.
Black Pullet, The : A French magical publication supposedly
printed in 1740, purporting to be a narrative of an officer
who was employed in Egypt. While in Egypt the narrator
fell in with a magician to whom he rendered considerable
servicE>, and who \Vhen he expired left· him the secret of
manufacturing a blacl!. pullet which had much skill in go!d-
fmdin~. In it we :find much plagiarism from the Comt.e
de Gabalis (See Elementary Spirits,) and the whole work
if intere~ting, is distinctly derivative. It contains many
illustrations of talismans and magical ringf. The receipt
for bringing the black pullet into existences describes that
a black hen should be ~et to hatch one of its own eggs, and
that during the process a hood should be drawn over its
eyes so that it cannot sec. It is also to be- placed in a box
lined with black. material. The chick thus hatched will
have a particular instinct for detecting the place~ wherein
gold is hidden.

Blake, WiUlam : (1757-1827) Poet, Mystic, Painter and
Et:gravcr, is one of the most curious and significant 1igures
in the whole history of English literature, and a man who
has likev.-ise exerted a wide influence on the graphic a.rts.
He was born in London on the 28th of November, 1757.
It would seem that his parents and other relatives were
humble folk, but little is known definitely about the family
while their ancestry is a matter of discussion. Mr. W. B.
Yeats, who is ari ardent devotee of Bltrke, and has edited
his writings, would have it that the poet was of Irish descent
but though it is true that the name Blake is common in
Ireland to this day, especially in Galway, Mr. Yeat's con·
1:ention is not supported by much trustworthy evidence,
and it is contradicted by Mr. Martin J. Blake in his gene-
alogical work, Blake Family Records.
William manifested a:sthetic predilections at a very early
age, and his father and mother did not discourage him
bereiu, but offered to place him in !he st~~~~ of a painter.
The young man demurred however, pomting out that
the apprenticeship was a costly one, and saying gen·
erous!y that his numerous brothers and sisters should be
considered, and that it was not fair that the family's ex-
<hcquer should be impoverished on his behalf. Thereafter
engraving was suggested to him as. a profession, not just
because it necessitated a less expensive training than
painting, but also as being more likely than the latter to
yield a speedy financial return ; and accepting this offer,
Blake went at the age of fourteen to study under James
:Basire, an engraver whose plates are but little esteemed
1:0·day, yet who enjoyed considerable reputation while
alive, and was employed offici:.lly by the Society of An-
tiquaries. Previous to this a more noted manipulator
Blake
of the burin, William Ryland, a protege of George III, had
been suggested as one who would probably give a capital
training to the boy : but the latter, on being taken to see
Ryland, evinced a strong dislike for him, and refused stoutly
to accept his teaching, declaring that the man looked as
thoJJgh born to be hanged. And it is interesting to note
that the -iuture artist of the Prophetic Books was right,
for only a few years later Ryland was convicted of forgery,
and forfeited his life in consequence.
Blake worked under :Basirc for 9evcn years, and during
the greater part of his time the pupil was engaged mainly
in doing dra·wings of Westminster Abbey, these being
destined to illustr)lte a hu9c book then in progress, tlie
Sepulchral Monuments of R1chard Gough. It is said that
Blake was chosen by his master to go and do the!'e drawings
not so much because he showed particular aptitude for
draughtmanship, as because he was eternally quarrelling
with his fellow-apprentices : and one may well believe,
indeed, that the young artist was convinced of his superi-
ority to his confreres,. and maCie enemies by failing to con-
ceal this conviction. Whilst at the Abbey, Blake as~erted
that he saw many visions. In 1778, he entered the Royal
Academy School. then recently founded : and here he
continued his studies under George Moser. a chastl and
enameller who engraved the first great seal of George III.
Yet it was not to· Moser that the budding visionary really
looked for instruction, he was far more occupied with study-
ing prints after the old masters, especially Michael Angelo
and Raphael; and one day Rosa found him engaged thus,
reproved him kindly but firmly, and told him he would be
acting more wisely if he took Charles lc Brun as his exem-
plar. He even hastened to show the pupil a volume of
engravings after that painter, so redolent always of the
worst tendencies of le grand siicle ; and, with this incident
in mind, it may be assumed that Blallc was deeply E(rateful
when, a little later he had shaken off the futile shackles
of the Royal Academy, and began to ,;·ork on his own
account. He had to work hard, however, for meanwhile
his affections had been en:;aged by a young woman, Cath-
erine Boucher, and funds were of course necessary ere it
was possible for the pair to marr>.'· Dut Blake slaved
manfully with his burin, engraving illustrations for maga-
zines and the like; and in 1782 he had his reward, his
marriage pcing solemnized in that year. His wife's name
i~:dicates that she was of French origin, and it would be
interesting to knO)\' if she was related to Franl)ois Boucher.
or to the fine engraver of the French Empire, Boucher-
Desnoyers ; but waiving these sreculations, it is p!casant
to rt>call that the marriage proved a singularly hal'PY one,
Blake's spocse clinging to him lovingly throughout all his
troubles and privations, and ever showing a keen appre-
ciation of l1is genius. As regards Catherine's appearance
there still exists a small pencil-drawing by Blalle, commonly
supposed to be a portratt of his wife ; and it shows a slim,
graceful woman, just the type of woman predominating
in Blake'.• other pictures; so it may be prescmed that she
frequently acted as his model, or-for Blalle had no fond-
ness for drawing from nature- that her appearance
gradually crystallised itself in his brain, and thus trans-
pired in the bulk of his works.
After his marriage Blake took lodgings in Green Street,
Leicester Fields ; and feeling, no doubt, that engraving
was but a poor staff for a married man to lean upon, he
opened a print shop in Broad Street. He made many
friends at this period, the most favoured among them
being Flaxman, the sculptor; and the lat1:er introduced
him to Mr. Matthew, a clergyman of artistic tastes, wno,
manifesting keen interest in the few poems which Blake
had alre2.dy written, generously offered to defray the cost
of printing .them. The writer gladly accepted the offer
Blake 72
and the resu twas a tiny volume, Potlical Sketches by W. B.
Thus encouraged, Blake gave up his printsel.ling business,
while simultaneously he went to live in Poland Street, and
soon after this removal he published bis So11gs ofInnocence,
the letterpress enriched by designs from his own hand.
Nor was this the only remarkable thing about the book,
fo• the whole thing was printed by the author himself,
and by a new -method of his own invention- a method
which can scarcely be detailed here owing to lack of space,
but which the <eader will find described adequately in
Mr. Arthur Hind's monumental History of Engravi11g and
Etchi11g. Blake lived in Poland Street for five years, and
during this time he achieved and issued The Book of Thel,
The Marriage of Heaven afld Hell, and the first book .of
The French Revolution. In 1792 he removed to Hercules
Buildings, Lambeth ; and while staying here he war forced
by dire poverty to do much commercial work, notably a
series of illustrations to You\\g•s Night Thoughts, yet he
found leisure for original t:lrawing and writing also, and
to this J?edod of his life belong the Gates of Paradise and
Songs of Experience. In a while he tired of London how-
ever, and so he went to Felpham, near Bognor, in Sussex,
taking a cottage there hard by where Aubrey Bea<dsley was
to live at a late< date, and here he composed Millon, 1em-
salem, and a la<ge part of the Prophetic Books, while
he made a new friend, William Hayley, who tepeatedly
aided him with handsome presents of money. The Sussex
scenery, besides- afterwards to inspire Whistler and Con-
der- appealed kee.nly to the poet, and in one of his lyrics
he exclaims :-
"Away to sweet Felpham, for Heaven is there," while
to Flaxman he wrote :-
" Felpham is a sweet place for study, because it is more
spiritual than London. Heaven opens here on all sides
her golden gates; her windows are not obstructed by
vapours, voices of celestial inhabitants a<e mo<e distinctly
heard, and their forms more distinctly seen, and my
cottage is also a shadow of their houses."
Yet Blake tired of Sussex as he had tired of his former
home, and in 1803 he retumed to London, taking a house
in South Bolton Street. Hc<e again he endured much
poverty, and' was then forced into doing illustrations to
Virgil, and also a series of designs for Blair's Grave ; but
later his financial horizon was brightened by help from
John Linnell, the landscape painter, and shortly after-
·wards the artist did some of his finest things, for instance
his Spiritual Portraits, and his drawings for The Book of
1ob, while after completing theso he commenced illustrating
the Divine Comedy of Dante. In 1821 he again changed
his home, taking up his abode now in Fountain Court,
Strand, and here he continued to work at the Dante draw-
ings ; but only seven of them we<e ever published, for
Blake's health was beginning to fail, his energies were
slackening, and he died in 1827.
Sixteen years before his death Blake held a public ex-
hibition of his drawings, engravings, illustrations and the
like ; and the ail.air was treated with haughty disdain,
the only pape< whtch saw fit to print a criticism being The
Examiner, edited by Leigh Hunt. It is customary for
Blake's idolators of to-day to attempt to heap scorn on
those who thus expressed callousness towards his work
and to yituperate mo~e particularly the many peopl~
a~ong h1s ~ontempora~es ~vho sho:Ved him frank antag-
O~Ism, but ~s. not all th1s n?1
sy blamtng of his bygone ene-
mtes and entics unnecessanly severe? For it muH be borne
in mind that the artist came as a complete novelty, the
mysticisf!l pern:eating_ his pic~ures h~ving virtually no
parallel m English patntmg pnor to hts advent. And it
should be remembered, too, that Blake as a technician has
many grave limitations; and limitations which must have
Blake
been exasperating to people accustomed to the art of that
amazing century .which begot masters like Ramsay, Gains-
borough and Romney, Watteau and Fragonard, De Ia
Tour and Clodion, all of them producing works eminently
graceful and p<e-emenently decorative. Now comparing
him to any of the~e men, Blake's modelling appears sadly
timid and amateurish, as witness his drawing of himself,
or his copy of Laurence's portrait of Cowper ; while passing
to his draughtsmanship, this is frequently inaccurate, and
nowhere embodies the fluency and charming rhythm re-
flected by nearly all the artists afo<esaid.. His colour again
is often thin and tawdry ; while as to his composition,
he is admirable. only on very rare occasions, the incon-
testable truth being that, in the bulk of his pictures, the
differ~nt parts have little or no relation to one another.
This is true especially of those of his works which include
a vast assembly of figures, yet even in various others of
simpler cast this lack of anything like arrangement is
equally paramount, and to choose an example, one need
only look at "The Door of Death" in America. This is
two pictures rather than one, and the spectator's gaze
wanders from side to side, fretted and bewildered.
rt were injustice to Blake himself, to omit noting these
technical flaws in his workmanship, yet it were· no less
unjust, if not actually ridiculous, to write at any length
contrasting him with the other masters of his century;
for his outlook and intention we<e wholly difie<ent from
theirs, and, lacking their charm and decorative value, he
transcends these men withal in divers respects. He is a
prince among mystics, his finest drawings are flushed with
weirdness and mystery, and he reincarnates visions and
phantasies as no one else has done id line and colour, not
even Rosetti. For Blake contrived to remain a child
throughout the whole of his life, and so, fo< bim, dreams
we<e an actuality, the things he saw in his trances were
real and living, and he perpetuated all these things with
just that obvious ancl definite symbolism which a child
would naturally use. When he wants to express " Vain
Desire ·• he draws a man trying to reach the sta<s with the
aid of an enormous ladder : in the " Resurrection of the
Dead " he delineates actual bodies soaring heavenwards,
and when his topic is moming, he shows a nude fo<m shining
hom the dusky mountain tops ; while for Bla]Je " The
Door of Death" is an actual stone portal. and when illus-
trating the text in Job, "'\'ith dream, upon my bed Thou
licarest me," he is not content to depict a sleeper with a
frighte11ed expression on his face, but draws all around
the sleeper the imaginary hor<ors which tormented him-
serpents. chains, and distorted human creatures. No\v
in the hands of most men all this sort of thing would yield
nothing but the laughable, yet somehow Blake's drawings,
even those which are weakest technically, invariably
possess just that curious air of distinction which is the
dominant characteristic of all truly g.eat rictu<es. I n
tine, he exp<essed the outlook of a child with a sublime
mastery never vouchsafed to chiid<en.
If Blake the draughtsman and illustrator was a fierce
iconoclast, turning his back resolutely on the styles current
in his time, most assuredly Blake the poet, enaC'ted a kin-
dred role, evincing a sublime contempt for the trammels
of Augustanism, and thus making straight the way for
Burns, for Wordsworth, and for the divine Shelley. Yet
just as Burns was tinged slightly by the typical failings
of the pasto<al century, so also Blake would seem to have
found it dii.Iicult originally to break his shackles: for oc-
casionally one finds him employing expletives, and this
suggests that at first he thought with Pope and his school
that verse is futile unless preci.>e ; while some of bis pic-
tures of child life in S<mgs of Innocence arc unduly pretty
and idyllic, almost as idyllic as the scenes in Goldsmith's
Blake 73 Bodin
Deserted Village. Unlike Lowry and Mr. Kenneth Grahame
those exquisite adepts in the delineation of children, Blake
show; only one side of childlife : for his children are nearly
all out for a holiday, they are seldom vexed, or cross, or
angry, and their eyes ate hardly ever dim with tears. At
least, however, they are prone to dream dreams and see
visions: and it is significant that, in one poem, the writer
describes a child unto whom arc revealed things hidden
from his father's eyes:-
" Father, 0 father I what do we here,
In this land of unbelief and fear ?
The land of dreams is better far
Above the light of the morning star."
That verse and many others besides, charm at once by
a fusion of complete naturalness with rare beauty : and
the genius of Blake in his earlier P.oems is really this, that
with the ~imple language of childhood, and out of the
simple events of childlife, he makes a noble and enduring
art-an art, char$cd as surely as his own drawings v;ith
an air of distinction.
Had Blake contented himself with writing his Poettcal
Sketches, his Sot:gs of Innocence and the subsequent Songs
of Experience, the charge of madness could not well have
been levelled at him by his contemporaries. It was his
later writings like The Book of Thel and the Prophetic Books
which begot this imputation, for in these later poems the
writer casts his mantle of ~implicity to the winds, he sets
himself to give literary form to visions, and he is so purely
spiritual and ethereal, so far beyond the realm of normal
h\tmao speech, that mysticism frequently devolves into
crypticism. His rhythm, too, is often so subtle that it
hardly seems rhythm at all; yet even in his weirdest flights
Blake is still the master, he still embodies that curious
something which differentiates great art from the rank and
file of ::esthetic products. And if, as ob~crved before, the
colouring in many of his water-colour dra\\ings is sadly
thin and poor, the very reverse is true, and true abundantly
of the poems written towards the close of his life. Glowing
and gorgeous tones are omnipresent in these. they have the
barbaric pomp of Gautier's finest prose, the glitter and
opulence of Berlio?:' or \Vagner's orchestration, nay the
richness and splendour of a sunset among towering
mountains.
No account of Blake would be complete without some
account of the literature which has grown up around his
name, a literature whereof many items are more than
worthy of the topic they celebrate. The earliest systematic
biography of the master is that by Alexander Gilchrist,
1863, a book, the more valuable inasmuch as it contains
many reproduction~ of Blake's drawings, notably the whole
of the job set: and since Gilchrist's day the artist's life
bas been rewritten by Alfred I. Story, 1893, and by Edwin
J. Ellis, 1907, while his letters have been collected and
annotated by Frederick Tatham, 1906. Much interesting
and important matter concerning Blake is contained in
T he Life atld Letters of Samuel Palmer, by A. W. Palmer,
1892 in A Memoir of Edward Calvert by Samuel Calvert,
1893. and in The Life of fohtl Limtell by A. T. Story. 1892,
while as regard~ critical studies of the master, perhaps the
best is Swinburne's eloquent tribute. 1868, and further
works of note arc those of Richard Garnett, Mr. Arthur
Symons and l\1. Basil de Selincourt. The student should
also consult Ideas of Good and Evil by W. B. Yeat~. 1903,
and The Rosetti Papers by W. M. Rossetti, 1903, while be
will find it advisable to look also at an edition of the fob
illustrations containing an able introduction by :Mr. Laur-
ence Binyon, 1906. To speak finally of edition~ of Blake's
own writings these are of course numerous, but the only
one which is really complete is that edited by E. J. Ellis,
1906. W. G. B-M.

Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna : wa! born at Ekaterinoslav
Russia, on the 31st of july, 1831, She was the daughter
of Colonel Peter Hahn, a member of a )1eck!enburg family
settled in Russia. She married, at the age of seventeen
Nicephore Blavatsky, a Rus..<>iao official in Caucasia, a man
very much older than herself. Her married life was of!hort
duration as she separated from her husband in a few months.
The next yeac or so she occupied chiefly in travelling, Texas
Mexico, Canada and India, were each in turn the scene
of her wanderings, and she twice attempted to enter Tibet.
on one occasion she managed to cross itt frontier in disguise
but lost her way. and after various adventures was found
by a body of horsemen and escorted homewards. The
period between 1848 and 18,58, she described as the" veiled"
time of her life, refusing to divulge anything that happened
to her in these ten years, save stray allusions to a seven
years' stay in Little and Great Tibet, or in a " Himalayan
Retreat." In 18.58 she returned to Russia, where she soon
achieved distinction as a spiritualistic medium. Later on
she went to the United States where she remained for six
years, and became a naturalised citizen. She became
prominent in spiritualistic·circlc~ in America about 1870.
It was there that she founded her school of Theosophy.
The idea occurred to her of combining her spiritualirtic
"control" with Buddhistic legends about Tibetan sages,
and she professed to have direct " astral " communication
with two Tibetan mahatmas.
With the aid of Col. Henry Olcott, she founded in :S:ew
York, in 187.5. the Theosophical Society with a threefold
aim: (I) to form a universal brotherhood of man; (2) to
study and make known the ancient religions, philosophies
and sciences ; (3) to investigate the laws of nature and
develop the divine powers latent in man. In order to gain
converts to Theosophy she was obliged to appear to perform
miracles. This she did with a large measure of success, but
her" methods" were on several occ~ion~ detected as fraudu-
lent. Nevertheless her commanding personality ·secured
for her a large following, and when she died, in 1891, she
was at the head of a large body of believers in her teaching,
numbering about Ioo,ooo persons. (See Theosophy.)

Bodin, Jean : a jurisconsult and student of demonology, who
died of the plague in 1596. An Angevin by birth, he
studied law in youth and published his Republique, which
La Harpe calls " the rerm of the spirit of law," but it is
his Demonomanie des Sorciers by which he is known to
occultists. I n this work he defended sorcery, but propa-
gated numerous errors. By his Colloquium heptaplomeron
de abdi~s rerum sublimium varcanus he arou!'cd very un-
favourable opinions regarding his religious vie.....-s. In it
Bodin 74
he discusses in the form of dialogue the theological opinions
of Jews, Mussulmans, and deists to the disadvantage of
the Christian faith, and although he died a Catholic be
professed in his time the tenets of Protestantism, Judaism,
sorcery, atheism and deism. The Dem01£Ql1!1
mie was pub-
lished in Pa.ris, in 1581, and again under the title of FUait d~s
demo11s el des sorciers at \Viort, in 1616. In its first aud
second books Bodin demonstrates tb:1.t spirits have com-
munication "'ith mankind, and traces the various charac-
teristics and forms which distinguish good spirits from
evil. He unfolds the methods of dia!x>!ic prophecy and
communication, and those of evocatio~ of e·.·il existences
of pacts with the Devil, of journeys through the air to the
sorcerers' Sabbath, of infernal ecstasies. of spells by which
one may change himself into a werewolf, and of carnal.
communion with incubi. and succubi. The third book
speaks of the manner of preventing the work of sorcerer.s
and obviating their charms and enchantments, and the
fourtlt of the manner in which sorcerers may· be !mown.
He concludes his study by refuting the work of John Wier
or \Vierius (q.v.) wh6, he asserts, was in error in believing
sorcerers to be fools and people of unsound mind, and states
that the books of that author should be burned ·• for the
honour of God."
Sir Walter Scott says : " Bodi11, a lively Frenchman,
explained the zeal of Wierius to protect the trib~ of
sorcerers from punishment, by stating that he himself
was a conjurer and the scholar of Cornelius Agrippa, and
might therefore well desire to save the lives of those accused
of the same league with Satan. Hence they threw on their
antagonists the offen§ive names of witch-patrons and
witch-advocates, as if it were impossible for any to hold
the opinion of Nauda!us, \Vierius, Scot, etc., without patron-
izing the devil and the witches against their brethren of
mortality. Assailed by such hea,•y charges, the philoso-
phers themselves lost patience, and retorted abuse in their
turn, calling Bodi11, Delrio, and others who used their
argument~. witch-advocates, and the like. as the affirming
and defending the existence of the crime seemed to increase
the number of witches, and assuredly augmented the list
of executions. But for a certain time the preponder-
ance of the argument lay on the side of the Demonolo-
gists.
Boehme, Jakob: (1575-1624) : German :\Iystic. The name o
this illustrious mystic and philosopher, who has excited
so wide and lasting an inftuerx:e, is sometimes spelt Bum
or Behm, Belzmou or Belmzont, while commoner s;;ill is the
form used at the bead of this article ; but it h probable
that Jakob's name was really B6hm:!, for that spelling
savours far more of bygone Germany than any of the
multifarious others do. Born in 1575, at Altrteidenberg,
in Upper Lusatia, the philosopher came of humble peasant
stock. and accordin!{!v his education consisted in but a
brief sojourn at the·village school of Seidenberg, about a
mile from his own home, while the greater part of his
childhood was spent in tending his father's flocks on t he
grassy sides of a mountain, known as the Landskrone.
This prnfeesion doubtles.l apperued to a boy or speculative
and introspective temperament, but betimes it transpired
that Jakob was not strong enough physically to make a
good shepherd, and consequently he leh home at the age
of thirteen, going to seek his fortune at Gorlitz, the neare~t
town of any sizP..
To this day GOrlitz is famous for its shoemakers, while
in Bcehme's time it was a very centre and stronghold of
the cobbling industry; so it was to a cobbler that the boy
went first in search of employment, and very soon he had
found what he wanted. Unfortunatelv. the few authentic
reconts of his career offer little in formation concerning his
early years, but apparen•ly he prospered tolerably well,
Boehme
it being recorded that in 1599 he became a master-shoe-
maker, and that soon a1terwards he was married to Kathar-
ina. daughter of Hans Kantzscbmann, a butcher. The
young couple took a house near the bridge in Keiss Voistadt
-their dwelling is etill pointed out to the tourist-and
some years L-lter Boehm~ sought to improve his business
by adding gloves to hi~ stock in trade, a departure which
scot him periodically to Prague to ::.cquire consignments
of the goods in question.
It is likely that Boehm~ began to write soon after be-
coming a ma<:ter-cobbler, if not even at an earlier period,
but it was not till he was approaching forty that his gifts
became known and appreciated. About the year r6tz, he
composed a philosophical treatise, Aurora, oder die }.[or-
gwr5te 1:11 Aufgaug, and, though thls was not printed till
much hter, manuscript copies were pa~sed from hand to
hand, the result being that the writer soon found himself
the centre of a local circle of thinkers aud scholars, many
of them people far above him in the social scale. These
did not say that the cobbler should ~lick to his last, but
realised that his intellect was an exceptionally keen one ;
and Boehme would no doubt have proceeded to print and
publish his work but for an unfortunate occurrence, just
that occurrence which has always been liable to harars
the man of bold and original -mind. In short, a charge of
heresy was brought against him by the Lutheran Church ;
he was loudly denounced from the pulpit by Gregorius
Richter, pastor primarius of Garlitz, and anon, the· town
council, fearing to contend with the omnipotent eccles-
iastical authorities, took po se~!:lion of the original manu-
script of Boehme's work, and bade the unfortunate author
desist from writing in the meantime. So far as can be
ascertained, he obeyc:l instructions for a little while, per-
haps fearing the persecution which would await him if he
did otherwise, but by t6r8 he was busy again, compilina
polemical and expository treatises; while in 1622, he wrot:
certain short pieces on repentance, resignation, and the
like. These last were the only things from his pen which
were published in book form during his lifetime, and with
his consent, nor were they of a nature likely to excite
clerical hostility; but a little later Boehme circulated a
less cautious theological work, Der Weg :·t Christa, and this
wa~ the signal for a fre3h outbur~t of hatred on the part
of the church, Richter storming from his pulpit once again.
The philosopher, however, contrived to go unscathed, and,
during a brief sojourn at Dresdtm, he had the pleasure of
listening to sundry orations made in Ius praise by some
of his admirers, whose number was now greatly increased.
But Boehme was not destined to survive this triumph long,
for, struck down by fever at Dresden, he was carried with
great difficulty to his home at Garlitz, and there be died in
1624, his wife being absent at the time
Boehme·s literary output divides itself easily and natur-
ally into three distinct sections, and indeed he himself
observed this, and drew up a sort of specification wherein
he virtually indicated his successive aims. At first he
was concerned simply with the study of tllO deity, and to
this period belongs his Aurora; next he grew interested
in the manifestation of the divine in the structure of the
world and of man, a predilection which resulted in four
great works, Die Drei Principien Golllichens IVes IVescus,
Vom Dreifachen Lebe~a der J
1lenscilen, Von der J'.fensch-
werdomg Christi, and Vo11 der Gebarl and Be:lichnung A lleY
Wesc11; while finally, he devoted himself to advanced
theological speculations and researches, the main outcome
being his Von Christi Testa•nenlen and his Vo,. der Chaden-
walzl: ,,fyslerirun ,,[agmmr. Other notable work• from
his hand, are his seven Que!lgeister, and likewi~e his study
of the three first properties of eternal nature, a treatise
in which some of his ardent devotees have found Sir Adam

have stipulated as one of the conditions, that he should
allow of the proceedings against Boniface, which were to
make his memory infamous. Preparations were again
made to carry on the trial of Boniface, but the king's ne-
cessities compelled him to seek other boons of the supre:ne
pontiff, in consideration of which he agreed to drop the
prO!'ecution, and at last, in 1312, Boniface was declared
in the council of Vienne, innocent of all the offences \~ith
which he had been charged.
If we may place any faith at all in the \~itn~ses who
were adduced against him, Boniface was at bottom
a freethinker, who concealed under the mitre the spirit
of mockery which afterwards shone forth ~n his country-
man Rabelais, and that in moments of relaxation, especially
among those with whom he was familiar, he was in the
habit of speaking in bold-even in cynical-language, of
things which the church regarded as sacred. Persons were
brought forward who deposed to having heard expre~sions
from the lips of the pope, which, if not invented or exag-
gerated, ~avour of infidelity, and even of atheism. Other
persons rleposed that it was commonly reported in Italy,
that Boniface had communication with demons, to whom
he offered his worship, whom he bound to his service by
necromancy, and by whoso agency he acted. They said
further, that he had bten heard to hold conversation with
spirits in the night; that he had a certain" idol," in which
a "diabolical spirit" was enclosed, whom he was in the
habit of consulting ; while others said he had a demon
enclosed in a ring which he wore on his finger. The ,~it­
nesses in general spoke of these reports only as things which
they had heard ; but one a friar, brother Bernard de
Sorano, deposed, that when Bolliface was a cardinal, and
held the office of notary to Nicholas III., he lay with the
papal army before the castle of Puriano, and he (brother
Bernard) was sent to receive the surrender of the castle.
lie returned with the cardinal to Viterbo, where he was
lodged in the palace Late one night, as he and the car-
dinal':; chamberlain were lookins out of the window of the
room he occupied, they saw Benedict of Gaeta (which was
Bon1ja(l~ s name before b~ was made pope) enter a garden
adjoinin~ the palace, alone, and in a mystedous manner.
He made a circle on tfle ground ,~;th a sword, and placEd
himself in the middle, having with him a cock, and a fire
in an earthen pot (in q14adam olla tenea}. Having seated
himself in the middle of the circle, be killed the cock
and threw its blood in the fire, from which smoke
immediately issued, while Benedict read in a certain book
to conjure demons. Presently brother Bernard heard a
great noise (rumorem magm•m) and was much terrified.
Then he could distinguish the voice of some one saying,
•· Give us the share," upon which Benedict took the cock
threw it out of the garden, and walked away v,;thout ut-
tering a word. Though he met several persons on his
way, he spoke to nobody, but proceeded immediately to
a chamber near that of brother Bernard, and shut him::elf
up. Bernard declared that, though he knew there was
nobody in the room with the cardinal, he not only heard
him talking all night, but be could distinctly perceive a
strange voice answering him.
Bonnevault, Pierre : A sorcerer of Poitou in the seventeenth
century, who was arrested as he was on his way to the
Devil's Sabbath. He confessed that on the first occasion
be had been present at that unholy meeting he bad been
taken thither by his parents and dedicated to the Devil,
to whom he had promised to leave his bones after death,
but that he had not bargained to leave his infernal majesty
his immortal soul. He admitted that he called Satan
master, that the Enemy of Man had assisted him in various
magical acts; and that he, Bonnel!au/1, had slain various
persons through Satanic agency. In the end he \\"aS con-
de:.nned to death. His brother Jean, accused of sorcery
at the same time, prayed to the Devil for assistance, and
was raised some four or five feet from the ground and
dashed back thereon, his skin turning at the same time to a
blue-black hue. He confessed that he had met at the
Sabbath a young man through whom he had promised
one of his fingers to Satan after his death. He also told
how he had been transported through the air to the Sabbath
how he had received powders to slay certain people whom
he named, and for these crimes he received the punishment
of death.
Bonnevault, Maturln de : Father of the preceding also
accused of sorcery, visited by experts who found upon
his right shoulder a mark resembling a small rose, and

cerer, indeed, he confessed that he had espoused BerthomC>e
de Ia Bedouche, who with her father and mother practised
!'>Orccry, and how he had gone to seek serpents and toads
for the purposes of their sorceries. He said that the Sab-
bath was held four times yearly, at the feasts of Saint
John the Baptist, Christmas, Mardi gras and Paques.
He had slain seven persons by sorcery, and avowed that
he had been a sorcerer since he was seven yeaTS of age.
He met a like fate with his sons.

Book or the Dead : An arbitrary title given to an Egyptian
funerary work called pert em hru, the proper translation
of which is: "coming forth by day," or •· manifested in
the light." There arc several versions or recensions of
this work, namely .those of Heliopolis, Thebes and Sais,
these editions differing only inasmuch as they were edited
by the colleges of priests founded at these centres. Many
papyri of the work have been discovered, and passages
from it have been inscribed upon the walls of tombs and
pyramids. and on sarcophagi and mummy-wrappings.
It is undoubtedly of extremely early date: how early it
would. indeed be difficult to say with any exactness, but
in the course of centuries it was greatly added to and modi-
fied. In all about 200 chapters exist, but no papyrus has.
been found containing all these. The chapters are quite
independent of one another, and were probably all com·
posed at different times. The main subject of the wh<;>le
is the beatification of tho dead, who were supposed to reClte
the chapters in order that they might gain power and enjoy
the privileges of the new life.
The work abounds in magical references, and it is its
magical side alone which w._ can consider here. The whole
trend of the Book of the Dead is thaumatmagic, as its
purpose is to guard the dead against the dangers which
they have to face in reaching the other world. As in most
mythologies, the dead Egyptian had to encounter malig-
nant spirits, and was threatened by many dangers before
reaching his haven of rest. He had also to undergo judg-
ment by Oriris, and to justify himself before being per-
mitted to enter the realms of bliss. This he imagined he
could in great part accomplish by the recitation of various
magical formula:, and spe~ls, which. would ward off !he
evil infiuences opposed to him. To this end every Egyptian
of means had buried with him a papyrus of the Book of
the Dead, in which was contained at least all the chapters
necessary to his encounter with such formidable adversaries
as he would moct at the- gates of Amenti (q.v.). the Egyptian
Hades. and which would assist him in making replies during
Book of the Dead 77 Borrl
his ceremony of justification. First amongst these spells
were the "words of power" (See " Egypt"). The Egyp-
tians believed that to discover the " secret " name of a god
was to gain camplctc ascendancy over him. Sympathetic
magic wa~ in vogue in Egyptian burial practice, {or we
find in Egyptian tombs of the better sort, paintings of
tables laden with viands of several descriptions, the in-
scriptions attached to which convey the idea of boundl~s
liberality. Inscripticns like the following are extremely
common-" To the )(a or soul of so-and-so, 5,ooo loaves
of bread, 500 gec3e, and s.ooo jug~ of beer." Those dcdit:a·
tions CO!:t the generous don<'rs little, as they merely had
the objects named painted upon the wall of the tomb,
imagining that their kas or astral counterparts would be
eatable and drinhble by the deceased. This of course
is merely an extension ol the neolithic savage conception
that articles buried with a m:.tn had their astral counter-
parts and would be of use to him in another world.
Pictorial representation played a con~iderable part in
the magical ritual of the Book of the Dead: One of the
pleasures of the dead was to sail over Heaven· in the boat
of Ra, and to secure this for the deceased one must paint
cert.'1.in pictures and mutter over them words of power.
On thi!l. Budge in his Egyptian Ma~ic say~: '.'On a piece
of clean papyrus a boat is to be drawn w1th mk made of
green abut mixed with anti water, and in it are to be figures
of Isis, Thoth, Shu, and Khepera, and tho deceased; when
this had been done the papyrus must be fastened to the
breast of the deceased. care being taken that it does not
actually touch his body. Then shall his spirit enter into
the boat of Ra each day, and the god Thoth shall take
heed to him, and he shall sail about with him into any
place that he wisheth. Elsewhere it is ordered that the
boat of Ra be painted ' in a pure place,' and in the bows
is to be painted a figure of the deceased ; but Ra was
~upposed to travel in one boat (called Atet) until noon,
and another (called Sektet) until sunset, and provision
had to be made for the deceased in both boats. How
wa:: this to be done ? On one side of the picture of the
boat a figure of the morning boat of Ra was to be drawn,
and on the other a figure of the afternoon boat ; thus the
one picture was capable of becoming two boats. And,
provided the proper offcrin~s were made for the deceased
on the birthday of Osiris, has soul would live for ever, and
be would not die a second time. According to the rubric
to the chapter in which these directions are given, the
text of it is as old, at least, as the time of Besepti, the fifth
-
king of the rst. dynasty, who reigned about B.C. 4350,
and the custom of ;-'tinting the boat upon papyrus is prob-
ably contemporaneous. The two following rubrics from
Chapters CXXXIII. and CXXXIV., respectively, ·will
explain slill further the importance of such picture:::-
" 1. • This chapter shall be recited over, a boat four
cubits in length. and made of green porcelain (on which
have been painted) the divine sovereign chiefs of the cities ;
and a figure of heaven with its stars shall be made also,
and this thou shalt have made ceremonially pure by means
{)f natron and incense. And behold, thou shalt make an
image of Ra In yellow colour upon a new plaque and set
it at the bows of the boat. And lx:hold, thou shalt make
an image of the spirit which thou dost wish to make per-
fect (and place it) in this boat, and thou shalt make it to
travel about in the boat (which shall be made in the form
of the boat) of Ra; and he shall see the form of the god
Ra himself therein. Let not the eye of any man what-
soever look upon it, with the exception of thine own self,
or thy father, or thy son, and guard (this) with great care.
Then shall the spirit be perfect in the heart of Ra, and
it shall give unto him power with the company of the gods ;
and the gods shall look upon him as a divine being like
unto themselves ; and mankind and the dead shall fall
down.upon their faces. and he shall be seen in the under-
world in the form of tl1e radiance of Ra.'
"z. 'This chapter shall be recited over a hawk standing
and having the white crown upon his head, (and over
figures of) the gods Tem, Shu, Tefnut, Seb, Nut. Osiris,
Isis. Suti. and Nephthys, painted in yellow cclour upon
a new pl:tque, which shall be placed in (a model of) the
boat (of Ral, along with a figure of the spirit whom thou
wouldst make perfect. These thou shalt anoint with
cedar oil, and incetlse shall be offered up to them on the
fire, and feathered fowl shall be roasted. It is an act of
praise to Ra as he journeyeth, and it shall cause a man to
have his being along with Ra day by day, whithersoever
the god vayageth ; and it shall destroy the enemies of Ra
in very truth regularly and continually.' "
It was understood that the words of power wer:~ not to
be spoken until after death. They were "a great mys-
tery " but " the eye of no man whatsoever must see it,
for it is a thing of abomination for every man to know
it. Hide it, therefore: the Book of the,Lady of the Hidden
Temple is its name.'' This would seem to refer to some
spell uttered by Isis-Hathor which delivered the god Ra
or Horus from trouble, or was of benefit to him, and it is
concluded that it may be equally eflicaciou~ in the case
of the deceased.
Many spells were included in the Book of the Dead for
the purpose of preserving the mummy against mouldering,
for assisting the owner of the papyrus to become as a god
and to be able to transform himself into any shape he
desired. Painted offerings were also provided for him
in order that he might give gifts to the god~. Thus we
sec that the Rook of the Dead was undoubtedly magical
in its character, consisting as it did of a series of spells or
words of power, which enabled the speaker to have perfect
control over all the powers of Amcnti. The only moment
in which the dead man is not ma~ter of his fate is when
his heart is weighed by Thoth before Osiris. If it does
not conform to the standard required for justification, he
is cast out ; but this excepted, an absolute knowledge
of the Book of the Dead safeguarded the deceased in every
way from the danger of damnation. So numerous are
the spells and charms for the use of the deceased, that to
merely enumerate them would be to take up a good deal
of space. A number of the chapters consist of prayers
and hymns to the gods, but the directions as to the magical
uses of the book are equally numerou~. and the conception
of supplication is mingled with the idea of circumvention
by sorcery in the most extraordinary manner.

seventeenth century, born at :Milan, in 1627. In youth
his conduct was so wayward that at last he was compelled
to seek refuge in a church in dread of the vengeance of
those whom he had wronged. However, he speedily
cloaked his delinquencies under the cloak of imposture
and hypocrisy, and he pretended that God bad chosen
him to reform mankind and to re-establish His reign below.
He also claimed to be the champion of the Papal power
against all heretics and Protestants, and wore a wondrous
sword which he alleged Saint Michael had presented him
with. He said that he had beheld in heaven a luminous
palm-branch which was reserved for him. He held that
the Virgin was divine in nature, that she had conceived

Bottle Imps : A class of German spirits, similar in many
v.'3.ys to Familiars. The following is the prescription of
an old alchymist, given by the Bishop of Dromore in his
Relic~ of Ancient Poetry, Cor the purpose of securing one of
these fairies. First, take a broad square crystal or Vene-
tian glass. about hree inches in breadth and length. Lay
it in the blood of a white hen on three 'Vednesdays or
three Fridays. Then take it and wash it with holy water
and fumigate it. Then lake three hazel sticks a year old ;
take the bark orr them ; make them long eno~;gb to write
on them the name of the fairy or spirit whom you may
desire three times on each stick, which must be flat on
one side. Bury them under some hill haunted by fairies
on the Wednesday before you call her ; and on the Friday
following dig them out, and call her at eight, or three, or
ten o'clock, which are good times {or this purpose. In
order to do so successfully one must be pure, aod face to-
ward the East. When you get her, tie her to the glass.

Brahan Seer, The : Coinneach Odhar (Kenneth Ore). Al-
though Coinneach Odhar is still spoken of and believed
in as a seer throughout the Highlands, and especially in
the county of Ross and Cromarty, his reputation i.~ of
comparatively recent growth. The first literary reference
to him was made by Hugh l\Iil!er in his Scs1:es and Lege11ds
of the.Nortl> of Scotland (1835). About half a century
later a collection of the Seer's predictions was published by
the late Mr. Alexander Maclcenzie, Im·erness, the author
ofseveral clan histories. Many of these alleged foretellings
are of a trivial charactEr. The most important prophecies
attributed to Coinneach (Kenneth) are those which refer
to the house of Seafotth Mackenzie3. One, which is sup-
posed to have been uttered in the middle of the se~·en­
teenth century, foretold that tl:e last of the Scafortbs
would be deaf. It was uttered at llrahan Castle, the chief
scat of the Seaforths, near Dingwall, after the seer had
been condemned to death by burning, by Lady Seaforth
for some offensive remark. lie declared to her ladyship
that he would go to heaven, but she would ne,·er reach
it. A~ a sign o£ this he declared that when he was burned-
a raven and a dove would hasten towards hit ashes. If
the dove was the first to arrive it would be proved his hope
was well founded. The same legend is attached to the
memory of Michael Scott-a rather suggestive fact. Ac-
cording to tradition, Kenneth was burned on Chanonry
Point, near Fortrose. No record survives of this event.
The first authentic evidence regarding the alleged seer,
was unearthed by Mr. "William l\1. l\lackenzie, editor of
Barbour's Bmce, who found among the Scottish Parlia-
mentary records of the sixteenth century an order, which
was sent to tho Ross-shire authorities, to prosecute several
wizards, including Coinneach Odhar. This was many years
before there was a Seaforth. It is quite probable that
Kenneth was burned, but the legendary cause of the tale
must have been a " tilling in " of late tradition. Kenneth's
memory apparently had attached to it many floating
prohcc1es and sayings including those attributed to Thomas
and :IHchael Scott. The sayings of "True Thomas " were
hawked through the Highlands in Gaelic chap books, and
so strongly did the bard appeal to the imaginations of the
eighteenth century folks of Inverness, that they associate
him with the Fairies and Fingalians {Fians) of the local
fairy mound. Tom-na-hurich. A Gaelic saying runs,
" \Vhen the horn is blown, True Thomas will come forth."
Brahan 79 Bridge of Soul~
Thomas took the place of Fingal (Finn or Fionn) as chief
of the " Seven Sleepers " in Tom-ua-hurich, Inverness.
At Cromarty, whiclt waJ once destroyed by the sea,
Thomas is alleged to havt foretold that it would be
thrice destroyed. Of course, the Rhymer was never in
Cromarty and probably knew nothing about it. As he
supplanted Fingal at Invemess, so at Cromarty he appear.-
to have supplanted .-orne other le~endary indh-idual. The
only authentic historical fact whtch remai>,s i~ that Coin-
neach Odhar wa.~ a notoriou~ wizard, and of mature years,
in the middle of the sixteenth c.,ntury. Wizards wer~ not
necess:uily see•s. 1t is significant that no reference is
made to Kenneth in the letters received by Peprs from
Lord Reay, regarding second-si~tht in the seventeenth
century, or in the account of Dr. Johnson's Highland
tour, although the le-trned doctor investigated the pro-
blem sympathetically.
In the Scottish H ighlands no higher complim~;nt could
be paid to the memorr of any J?Opular man than to attribute
to him the gift of" second stght." Hev. John Morrison,
minister of Petty, near Inverness, who was a bard, was one
of the reputed seers of this order. Many of his " wonderful
sayings" were collected long after his death. Rev. Dr.
I<:ennedy, a Dingwall Free Church minister, and a man
of strong personality and pronounced piety, is reputed to
have had not only the ·· gift of prophecy" but also the
"gift of healing." He was himself a believer in "second
sight "and stated that his father was able to foretell events.
In his The Days of tlte Fathers in Ross-shire (186r), he
makes reference to several individul:,ls who were similarly
·'gifted " with what he believed to be a G<>d-given power.
One of his seers was reputed to have foretold the ·' Dis-
ruption " of the Church of Scotland about sixteen years
before the event took place. B}' this time the seers had
acquired the piety of the people who believed in them.
Even the notorious Kenneth, the Brol:an seer a Pagan and
a wizard, became glorified by doubtful tradition, like the
notorious Michael Scott, one of his prototype~ .
References to second sight in the Highlands arc made
in tlte following publications : Kirk'? Secret Commonwealth
of Elves, Fazms a.!d Fairies; Martin'~ Western Isles of
Scotland; Deuterosophin (Seco11d J(11owledge) or a Brief
Discourse concer11iug Second Sight by Hev. John F razer
(Edinburgh, Ruddiman, Ancd and Co, 1763), Miscellanies
by John Aubrey, F.R.S (London, 1696). That there is
sufficient evidence to justify the serious investigation of
" Second sight" phenomena in the Scothsh Highlands,
no doubt can remain. But th:~.t is no reason why the
"Bralta11 Seer" le~ends should be accepted as genuine,
especially when it 1s found that Kenneth died before the
Seaforth branch of the l\lackenzies came into existence.
Whoever foretold the fall of that house. it was certainly
not the " notorious wizar<.l " of the Scottish Parliamentary
records. No doubl, Kenneth made himself notorious
by tyrannizing over a superstitious people in the sixteenth
century, and was remembered on that arcount. During
his lifetime he must have been credited with many hap-
penings supposed to have been caused by his spells. · Aftt>r
his death he ~athered an undeserved· reputation for
prophecy and ptety by tho snowball process-a not un-
famlliar happening in the past of the ;:,cottish H ighlands,
where Sir William Wall<~.ce, St. Patrick, St. B ean, and
others were reputed to bavt- been giants who flung glaciated
boulders from hill-top to hill-top across wide glens and
over lochs of respectable dimensions.

Breathings, The : One of the methods of yoga practice.
There are three varieties of breathing amongstyogis : (1) by
quite emptying the lungs. and holding them so as long
as possible; (2) by filling the lungs as full as may be; and
(3) by merely retaining whatever breath happens to b<! in
them. It is thus possible to suppress thought, thereby
saving up much vit~l force.

Bria1ie World : (Su Kabala.)
Briccriu surnamed '·of the Poisoned Tongue": an Ulster
chieltain mentioned in the myth of Cuchulain, a medi~~·a!
Iri~h romance. It is said that upon one occasion he asked
certain waniors to a feast, and started the question of
which of them was the greatest. Conall, Laery, and Cu-
ch~!ain, were selected. an~ a demon called "Tht- Terrible "
was requested to decide the point. He suggested who·
ever could cut off his, The Terrible's, head to-day, and
allow his own head to be cut off on the morrow, would be
the most courageous, and therefore most deserve the title
of champion. Cuchulain s ucceeded in beheading the
devil, who immediately picked up his head and vanished.
The next da}' he reappeared in his usual form in order to
cut off Cuchulain's head. On his placing his head on
the block, the demon told him to rise, and ::~cknowledged
that he was champion of Ireland.
Bridge Qf Souls: The superstition that the souls of the dead
sought the other world by means of a bridge is pretty
widely disseminated. The Rov. S. Baring Gould in his
Book of Folklore says : " As reoples became more civilised
and thought more d eeply o the mystery of death, they
conceived of a place where the souls lived on, and being
puz1led to account for the rainbow, came to the conclusion
that it was a bridge by means of which spirits mounted to
their abode above the clouds. The Milky Way was called
variously the Road of the Gods or the Road o.f Souls.
Among the Xorscmen, after Odin had constructed his
heavenly palace, aided by the dwarfs, he reared the bridge
Bifrost. which men call the rainbov:, by which it co1.:ld
be reached. It is of three colours ; that in the middle
is red, a nd is of fire, to consume any unworthy souls that
would ventcre up the bridge. In connection with this
idea of a bridge uniting heaven and earth, up which souls
ascended, arose the custom of persons constructing bridges
for the good souls of their kinsfolk. On runic grave-stones
in Denmark and Sweden we find such inscriptions as these:
'Xageilfr had this bridge built for Anuod, his good son.'
' The mother built the bridge for her only son.' ' Hold-
fast bad the bridge constructed for Harne, his father, who
lived in Viby.' ' Holdfast had the road made for Igul
and for Ura, his dear wife.' At Sundbystein, in the Up-
lands, is an inscription showing that three brothers and
sisters erected a bn dge ov<>r a ford for their !ather.
The bridge as a means of passage for the soul from this
earth to eternity must have been known also to the Ancients
for in the cult o f Demeter, the soddess of Death,
at Eleusis, where her mysteries were gone through, in
order to pass at once aiter death into Elyi!'ium, there was
an order of Bridge priestesses ; and the goddess bore the
name of the Lady of tbe Bridge. In Rome also the priett
was a brid2:e-builder pontife,.., as be undertook the ch~rge
of souls. In Austria and pa.rts of Germany it is still sup-
posed that children'ssouls are led up the rainbow to heaven.
Both in England and among the Chinese it is regarded as
a sin to point with the finger a t the bow. \Vitb us no
trace of the idea that it is a Bl'idgeofSouls remains. Prob-
ably this was thought to be a heathen belief and was ac-
cordingly forbidden, for children in the ~orth of England
Brig or Dread 80 Buer
to this day when a rainbow appears, make a cross on the
ground with a couple of twigs or straws, " to cross out the
bow." The \Vest Riding recipe for driving away a rain-
bow is : " Make a cross of two sticks and lay four pebbles
on it, one at each end."
Brig or Dread, The : There is an old belief, alluded t9 by
Sir Walter Scott, that the soul, on leaving the body, has
to pass over the Brie of Dread, a bridge as narrow as a
thread, crossing a great gulf. If the soul succeed in passing
it he shall enter heaven, if he fall off he is lost.

British National Association ot Spiritualists : A society
forme:! in 1873, m:~inly through the instrumentality of
i\1r. Dawson Rogers, to promote the interests ofspiritualism
in Great Britain. It numbered among its original vice-
presidents and members of council the most prominent
spiritualists of the day-Benjamin Coleman, Mrs. Mak-
dongall Gregory, Sir Charles lsham, Messrs. Jacken, Dawson
Rogers, and MoreLl Theobald, Drs. Wyld, Stanhope Speer.
and many others-while many eminent people of other
land<> joined the association as corresponding members.
The B.N.A.S. in x88z decided to change its name to" The
Central Association of Spiritualists." Among its com-
mittees was one for systematic rese~rch into the pheno-
mena of spiritualism, in which connection some interesting
scientific experiments were made in 1878. Early in t88-z
conferences were held at the Association's rooms, presided
over by Professor Barrett, which resulted in the formation
of the Society for Psychical Research. Many members
of the latter society wore recruited from the council of
the B.N.A.S., such as the Rev. Stainton ~loses, Dr. George
Wyld, ~1essrs. Dawson Rogers, and Morell Theobald. The
B.•
V.A .S. was at first associated with the Spiritualist,
edited by W. H. Harrison, but in 1879 the reports of its
proceedings were transferred to Spiritual .Voles, a paper
which, founded in the previous year, came to an end in
x881, as did also the Spiritualist. In the latter year
Dawson Rogers founded Light, with which the society
was henceforth associate:!. From the beginning of its
career, the B.N.A .S. h"s held itself apart from religious
and philosophical dogmatism, and has included among
its members spiritualists of a.!l sects and opinion~.

Britten, Mrs. Emma Hardlng9 : l11rs. Emma Hardinge, after-
wards M"rs. Hardi•:ge Britte11, was a. distinguished "in-
spirational" speaker, a. native of London, but whose first
championship of spiritualism was carried out in America.
In 1865 she came to Britain with the intention of retiring
from active service, but was persuaded by the spiritualists
there to continue her labours. Her eloquent extempore
lectures, delivered presumedly under spirit control, dealt
often with subjects chosen by the audience, and were of a
lofty and erudite character. She was the author of a
History of Modem American Spiritualism, and a careful,
if biased resume of spiritualism in all parts of the world,
entitled Nineteenth Century ,lfiracles.
Brocellande : A magic forest in Brittany, which figures in
the Arthurian legend. It was in this place that Merlin
was enchanted by Nimue or Viviana, Lady of the Lake,
and imprisoned beneath a huge stone. J;'he name Bro-
celifmde is often employed as symbolic of the dim un-
reality of legendary scenery.
Brohou, Jean : A physician of Coutarces, in the seventeenth
century. He was the author of an Almanack or ]oumal
of Astrology, with prognostications for the year 1572,
(Rouen, 1571), and a Descriptio" d'llne Merveilleuse et
Prodiigel4Se Comete, with a treatise on comets, and the
events they prognosticate (Paris, 1568}.

Brotherhood or the Trowel : An esoteric society which sprang
up at Florence towards the end of the fifteenth century,
which was composed of eminent architects, sculptors and
painters ; and continued in existente for over four hcndred
years. Their patron was St. Andrew, whose festival was
commemorated annually by ceremonies allied to the old
Mysteries.
Brothers or Purity : An association of Arab philosophers
founded at Bosra in the tenth century. They had forms
of initiation, and they wrote many works which were
aftcriYards much studied by the Jews of Spain.

Browne, Sir Thomas : A learned English medical man who
died in 1682 at an advanced age. Besides his famous
Religio Medici and Urn Burial, he was chiefly celebrated
by the manner in which he combatted popular errors in
a work entitled Pse"dodo.da Epadinium. an essay on popu-
lar errors,-an examination of many circum&tances in his
time received as veritable facts, and which he proved to
be false or doubtful. But frequently the learned author
replaces one error by anot1ter, 1f on the whole his book is
wonderfully accurate considering the date of its composi-
tion. The work is divided into seven books, the first of
which deals with those errors which spring from man's
love of the marvellous ; the !:CCond, errors arising from
popular beliefs concerning plants and metals, the third,
absurd beliefs connected wtth animals; the fourth book
treats of errors relative to man ; the fifth, errors recorded
by pictures ; the sixth deals with cosmogra.phical and
historical errors ; and the seventh, with certain commonly
accepted absurdities concerning the wonders of the world.
For the publication of this work he was charged with
atheism, which drew from·him his famous Religio A1edici..
Bruhesen, Peter Van : A Dutch doctor and astrologer who
died at Bruges, in 1571. He published in that town in
1550 a Grand and Perpetual Almamuk in which he scrupu-
lously indicated by the tenets of judicial astrology the
correct days for bathing, shaving, hair-cutting and so
forth. The work caused offence to a certain magistrate
of Bruges who plied the tonsorial trade, with the result
that there appeared against Brllliesetl's volume another
Grand and Perpetual Almanack, with the flippant !\Ub-
title a scourge for empirics a11d charlatans. This squib
was published by a rival medico, Fran~ois Ra.paert, but
Peter Ha.scha.erts, a surgeon, and a protagonist of astro-
logical science, warmly defended Bruhesen in his Astro-
logical BuciJler.
Bruillant : One of the actors mentioned in the Grat1d Saint
Graal. He it was who discovered the Grail Sword in
Solomon's ship, and with it slew La.mbor. For this u~e
of the holy sword, however, the whole of Britain suffered,
for no wheat grew, the fruit trees bare no fruit, and there
was no fish in the scl.. DruiUant lumself was pu'lished
with death.
Buckingham, Duke or : (See England.)

Buer : According to \Vierius, a demon of the second class.
He has naturally the form of a star, and is gifted with a
Buguet 81
knowledge of philosophy and of the virtues of medicinal
herbs. He gives domestic feliticy and health to the sick.
He has charge over fifteen legions.
Buguet : A French photographer who carne to London in
1874 and there produced spirit (>hotographs with consid-
erable skill. Many persons claun&d to recognise their
friends in the ~pirit pictures, and even after Buguet had
been arrested, and had confessed that he had resorted to
trickery, there were yet a number of persons who refused
to believe that he was a fraud, and thought that he had
been bribed to confess trickery of which he was ir.r-oocent.
(See Spirit Photography.)
Bune : According to 'Wierius a most powerful demon, and
one of the Grand Dukes of the Infernal Regions. His form
is that of a man. He docs flot speak s:LVe by signs only,
He removes corpses, haunts cemeteries, and marshals the
demons around tombs and the places of the dead. He
enriches and renders eloquent those who scr~·e him.
Thirty legions of the infernal army obey his call. The
demons who own his sway called Bunis, arc regarded by
the Tartars as exceedingly evil. Their power is great and
their number immense. But their ~orcerers arc ever in
communication with these demons by means of whom
they carry on their dark practices.
Burgot, Pierre : A werewolf, burned at Besan~on in 1521 with
Michel Verdun (q.v.).
Burial with Feet to the East : It was formerly the custom
among Christians to bury their dead with the feet towards
th{' east and head towards the west. Various reasons
are given for this practice, some authorities stating that
the corpse was placed thus in preparation for the reser-
rection, when the dead will rise with their faces towards
the cast. Others think this mode of burial is practised
in imitation of the posture of prayer.
Burma : A country cast of India and south of China, and
a province of British India, inhabited by an indigenous
stock of Indo-Chinese type which originally migrated
from Western China, at different periods, and which is
now represented by three principal divisions, the Talaings,
the Sbans, and the Barna, or Burmese proper, although
groups of several other allied races are found in the more
remote portions of the country. The civilisrd part of the
community, which, roughly speaking. is perhaps one half
of the population, rccogruzes a religion the constituents
of which are animism (q.v.) and Indian Brahmanic demon-
olatry, modified to some extent by Buddhistic influences,
and this cult iE steadily making f..rogres<> in the less en-
li~;htened and outlying tribes. V\ c have here to do only
wtth that portion of the popular be!ief which dt:als with
the more directly occult and with superstitiou, and we
shall refrain from any description of Burmese religion
proper which presents similar features to those cults from
which it takes its origin, and which are fully described
elsewhere.
The Burmese believe the soul immaterial and indepen-
dent of the body, to which it is only bound by special
attraction. It can quit and return to the body at will,
but can also be captured and kept from returning to it.
After death the soul hovers near the corpse as an invisible
butterfly, known as leippya. A witch or demon may
captUte the leippya while it wanders during the hours of
sleep, when sickness is sure to result. Offerings are made
to the ma~ician or devil to induce him to release the soul.
The Kach1ns of the Northern Hills of Burma believe that
persons having the evil eye posse-ss two souls, the secondary
soul being the cause of the malign influence.
Belief in Spirits.-Bclief in spirits, mostly malign,
is very general in Bt4rma, and takes a prominent place in
the religious belief of the people. The spirits of rain, wind
Burma.
and the heavenly bodies are in that condition of evolution
which usually result3 in their becoming full-fledged
deities, with whom placation gives place to worship.
But the spirits of the forest are true demons with
well·marked animistic characteristics. Thus the nat
or seiktha dwells in every tree or grove. His nature
is usually malign, but occasionally we find him the tutelar
or guardian of a village. In any case he rossesses a shrine
where he may be prvpiatiated by gifts o food and drink.
Several of these demoniac figures have almost achieved
godhead, so widespread have their cults become, and Hrnin
Nat, Chiton, and Wannein Nat, may be in!'tanced as fiends
of power the dread of which has spread across extensive
di«trict<'. The 1zats are probably of Indian origin, and
although now quite animistic in character may at one time
have been members of the Hindu pantheon. Many spirit
families such as the Seil1kaso, Akathaso, and Bommaso,
who inhabit various parts of the jun~le trees, are oi Indian
origin. The fulfilment of every wzsh depends upon the
nats or spirits, who are all powerful as far as man is con-
cerned. They arc innumerable. Every house has its
complement, who swarm in its several rooms and take up
their abode in its hearth, door-posts, verandahs, and
corners. The mus also inhabit or inspire \vild beasts, and
all misfortune is supposed to emanate from them. The
Burmans believe that the more materialistic dead haunt
the living with a malign purpose. The people have a
great dread of their newly deceased ancestors, whom they
imagine to haunt the vicinity of their dwellings for the
purpose of ambushing them. No dead body may be carried
to a cemetery except by the shortest route, even should
this necessitate the cutting a hole in the wall of the house.
The spirits of those who have died a violent death haunt
the scene of their fatality. Like the ancient Mexicans
(See Ciupipiltln', the Burmans have a great dread of the
ghosts of women who have died in childbed. The Kachins
believe such women to tum into vampires (swawm.t') who
are accompanied by their children when these die with
them. The spirits of children are often supposed to in-
habit the bodies of cats and dogs. The Burmans are
extremely circumspect as to how they speak and act to-
wards the inhabitants of the spirit-world, as they believe
that di.srespect or mockery will at once bring down upon
them misfortune or disease. An infinite number of
guardian spirits is included in the Burman demonological
system, and these are chiefly supposed to be Brahmanic
importations. These dwell in the houses like the evil
nats, and arc the tutelar~ of village communities, and even
of clans. They arc duly propitiated, at which ceremonies
rice, beer, and tea-salad are offered to them. 'Nomen
are employed as exorcists in a case of driving out the evil
1zats, but at the festivals connected with the guardian nats
they are not permitted to officiate.
Necromancy Mzd Occult Medicine.-Necromancy is of
general occurrence among the Burmese. The weza or
wizards are of two kinds, good and evil, and these are again
each subdivided into four classes, according to the materials
which they employ, as, for example, magic squares, mercury
or iron. The native doctors profess to cure the diseases
caused by witchcraft, and often specialise in various ail-
ments. Besides being necromantic, medicine is largely
astrological. There is said to be in Lower Burma a town
of wizards at Kale Thaungtot on the Chindwin River, and
many journey thence to have the effect:; of bewitchment
neutralised by its chief. Sympathetic magic is employed
to render an enemy sick. Indian and native alchemy
and cheiromancy are exceedingly rife. Noise is the uni-
versal method of exorcism, and in case~ of illness the patient
is often severely beaten, the idea being that the fiend which
possesses him is the sufferer.

female mediums profess to be the spouses of certain nats,
and can only retain their supernatural connection with a
certain spirit so long as they are wed to him. With the
exorcists training _
is voluntary and oven perfunctory. But
with the mediums it is severe and prolonged. Among the
ci:-llis~d Burmans a much more exhaustive apprentice-
ship IS demanded. Indeed a thorough and intricate
knowledge of some departments of magical and astrological
practice is necessary to recognition by the brotherhood,
the ~ntire art ~f wh~c.h is medico-magical: consisting of the
eorc1sm of evil spmts from human bemgs and animals.
The ~ethods employ~ ~r~ .sl!ch as usually accompany
exorciSm among all semi-CIVIlised peoples, that is, dancing,
flagellation of the affiicted person, induction of ectasy
oblation to the fiend in possession, and noise. '
Prophecy and Divitzation.-These are purely popular
in l1111•ma, and not hierophantic, and in some measure are
controlled bv the use of the Deitton, an astroloS~;tcal book
of Indian origin. The direction in which the blood of a
sacrificed animal flows, the knots in tom leaves, the length
of a split bamboo pole, and the whiteness or otherwise of
a hard-boiled egg, serve among others as methods of au-
gury. But by far the most important mode of divination
in use in Burma is that by means of the bones of fowls.
It is indeed univers:1l as deciding all the difficulties of
Burmese existence. Those wing or thigh bones in which
the bolos exhibit regularity are chosen. Pie::es of bamboo
ar~ inserted into these holes, and th~ resulting slant of the
suck defines the augury. If the sttck slants outward~ it
decides in favour of the measure under test. If it slants
inwards, the omen is unfavourable. Other methods of
divination are by the entrails of animals and b}' the con-
tent.'> of blown eggs.
Astrology.-Burmcs~ astrology derives both from Indian
and Chinese sources, and powerfully affects the entire
people. Every Burman is fully aware from his private
astrologer, of the trend of his horoscope regarding the near
future, and while active and enterpristng on his lucky days,
nothing wil! induce him to undertake any form of work
should the day be pyatthadane or ommous. The Beditz-
saya, or astrologers proper, practise a fully developed
Hindu astrology, but they are few in number, and are
practically neglected for the rural soothsayers, who fo11ow
the Chinese system .known as llpewan, almost identical
with the Taoist astrological tables of Chinese diviner~.
Fro~ this system are derived hNoscopes, fortunes, happ}'
roan·~ages, a~d prognosticati?ns regarding business afiairs.
But 10 practice the system IS often confounded with the
Buddhist calendar and much confusion results. The
Buddhist calendar is in popular use, whilst the Hpcwan
is purely astrological. Therefore the Burman who is ig-
noran_t of the latter must perforce consult an astrologer
who IS able to collate the two regarding his lucky and
unlucky days. The chief horoscopic influences are day
of birth, day of the week, which is represented by the
srmbol of a certain animal, and the p'>sition of th'.l dragon's
mouth to the terminal syllables of the day-names.
Magic.-Burmese magic consists in the making of chariTIS
the manufacture of occult medicine which will cause hallu-
cination, second sight, the prophetic state, invisibility,
or invulnerability. It is frequently " sympathetic."
(See 1\lagic) and overlaps into necromancy and astrology.
It does not appear to be at all ceremonial, and is to a great
extent unsophisticated, save where it has been influenced
by Indian and Buddhi'lt monks, who also draw on
native sources to enlarge their own knowledge.

Busardier : An alchemist of whom few particulars are on
record. Ho lived at Prague with a noble Courtier. Fall-
ing sick and feeling the approach of death, he sent a letter
to his friend Richtauson, at Vienna, asking him to come and
stay with him during his last moments. Richtausen set
out at once hut on arriving at Prague found that BHsardier
was dead. On inquiring if the adept had left anythin/
behind him the steward of the nobleman with whom he
had lived stated that only some powder had been left
which the nobleman desired to preserve. Richtausen by
some means got possession of the powder and took his
departure. On discovering this the nobleman threatened
to han~ hL~ steward if he did not recover the powder. The
steward sunnising that no one but Richtausen could have
taken the powder. armed himself and set out in puuuit.
Overtaking him on the road he at the point of the pistol,
made Richtausen hand over the powder. Richtausen
however contrived to abstract a considerable quantity.
Richtausen knowing the value of the powder presented
himself to the Emperor Ferdinand, himself an alchemist,
and gave him a quantity of the powder. The Emperor
assisted by ltis :-.'line Master, Count Russe, succeeded in
converting three pounds of mercury into ~old by means
of one grain of the powder: The Emperor ts said to have
commemorated the event by having a medal struck. bear-
ing the effi~y of Apollo with the caduceus of ;\-lercury and
an approprnte motto.
Richtausen was ennobled under the title of Baron Chaos.
::\lr. A. E. Waite in his LitJes of the Alchemists states
that " Among many transformations performed by the
same powder was one by the Elector of Mayence, in 1651.
He made projections with all the precautions possible to
a learned and skilful philosopher. Tho powder enclosed
in gum tragacanth to retain it effectually, was put into the
wax of a taper, which '"'as lighted, the wax being then
placed at the bottom of a crucet. These preparations
were undertaken by the Elector himself. He poured four
ounces of quicksilver on the wax, and put the whole into
a fire covered with charcoal above, below and around.
Then they began blowing to the utmost, and in about half
an hour on removing the coals, they saw that the melted
gold was over red, the proper colour being green. The
baron said the matter was yet too high and it was necessary
to put some silver into it. The Elector took some coins
out of his pocket, put them into the melting pot, combined
the liquefied silver with the matter in the crucet, and
having poured out the whole when in perfect fusion into
a !ingot, he found after cooling, that it was very fine gold,
but rather hard, which was attributed to the !ingot. On
again melting, it became exceedingly soft and the Master
of the J.\Iint declared to His Highness that it was more than
twenty-four carars and that he had never seen so fine a
quality of the precious metal."
Butter, Witches' : The devil gives to the witches of Sweden
cats which ate called carriers, because they are sent by
their mistresses to steal in the neighbourhood. The greedy
animals on such occasions cannot forbear to satisfy their
own appetites. Sometimes they eat to repletion and are
obliged to diSgorge their stolen meal. Their vomit is
always found in kitchen gardens,.is of a yellow colour, and
is called witches' butter.

figured in the shape of a god with the wings of a griffon.
He is supposed to mspire knowlt!dge of the liberal arts,
and to incite homicides. It is this fiend who can render
man invisible. He commands thirty-six legions.
Cablri, or more proper!)' Cabelri : A group of minor deities
of Greek origin, of the nature and worship of whom very
little is known. The name appears to be of Semitic c..ngin,
signifying the " ~reat gods," and the Cabiri seem to have
been connected m some manner with the sea, protecting
sailors and vessels. The chief seats of their worship were
Lemnos, Samothract>, Thessalia and Breotia. They were
originally only two in number -the elder idtnliiied with
Dionysus, and the younger identified ·with Hermes, who
was also known as Cadmilus. Their worship was at an
early date amalgamated with that of Demeter and Ceres,
with the result that two sets of Cabiri came into being-
Dionysus and Demeter, and Cadmilus and Ceres. A Greek
writer of the second century B.C. states that thoy were
four in number-Axisros, Ax.iokersa, Ax.iokersos, and C.as-
milus, corresponding, he states to Demeter, Persephone,
Had<'s and Hermes. The Romans identified the CabiYi
with thE' Penates. In Lemnos a festival of these deities
was held annually and lasted nine days, during which ;;.11
dome~tic and other fires were extinguished, and sacred
fire was brot:ght from Delos. From this fact it has been
judged that the Cabiri may have been volcanic demons ;
but this view has latterly been abandoned. It was in
Sarr.othracia that the cult of the Cabiri attained its widest
significance, and in this island as early as the fifU1 century
B.C. their mysteries were held with great eclat, and at-
tracted almost universal attention. Initiation into these
was regarded as a safeguard against misfortune of all kinds,
and persons of distinction exerted all their influence to
become initiates. In r888 interesting details as to the
bacchanal cult of the Cabiri were obtained by the excava-
tion of their temple near Thebes. Statues of a deity called
Cabeiros were found, attended by a boy cup-bearer. His
attributes appear to be bacchic.
The Cabiri are often mentioned as powerful magicians,
and Herodotus and other writers speak of the Cabiri as
sons of Vulcan. Cicero, however, regards them as the
chi!dren of Proserpine; and Jupiter is often named as
their father. Strabo, on the other hand, regards them
as the minil;ters of Hecate and Bochart recognises in them
the three principal infernal deities, Pluto, Proserpine, and
Mercury. It is more than likely that they were originally
of Semitic or Egyptian origin-more probably thE' former ;
but we find a temple of Memphis consecrated to them in
Egypt. It is not unlikely, as Herodotu~ supposes, that
the cult is Pt-lasgian in origin, as it is known that the Pe-
lasgians occupied the islan(l of Samothraoe, and established
there certain mysteries, which they afterwards carried
to Athens. There are also traditions that the worsh1p
of the Cabiri originally came from the Troad, a Semitic
centre. Kenrick in his Egypt before Herodol~ts brings
forward the following conclusions concerning the Cabiri :-
" r. The existence of the worship of the Cabiri at Mem-
phis under a pigmy form, and its connection with the
worship of Vulcan. The coins of Thessalonica also es-
tablish this connection ; those which bear the legend
' Kabeiros ' having a figure with a hammer in his hand,
the pileus and apron of Vulcan, and sometimes an anvil
.near the feet.
·• 2. The Cabiri belonged also to the Phrenician the-
ology. The proofs are drawn from the statements of
Herodotus. Also the coins of Cossyra, a Phrenician settle-
C
ablrl
ment, exhibit a dwarfish figure with the hammer and short
apron, and S()metimes a radiated head, apparently allusive
to the elemeat of fire, like the star of the Dios::uri.
•• 3· The is!e of Lcmnos was another remarkable s~t
of the worship of the Cabiri and of Vulcan, as representing
the element of tire. i\Iystic rites were celebrated here
over which they rresided. and th!l coins of.the islan~ ex-
hibit the head o Vulcan or a Cab1rus, w1th the p1leus,
hammer and forceps. It' was this connection with tire,
metallurgy. and the most remarkable l!r~uct o~ t.he _art,
weapons of war, which ~aused the _Cab•n t? be 1denblicd
with the Cureks of Eto!Ja, the ld;el Dactyli of Crete, the
Corybantes of Phrygia, and the Te~c~ines <?f _Rhodes. Th~y
were the same probably in Phccn1C1an ongin. the sam(. m
mystical and orgiastic rites, but different in number, gene-
alogy, and local circumstances, and by the ~ixture of
other mvthical traditions, accotding to the vanous coun-
tries in· which their worship prevailed. The fable that
one Cabirus had been killed by his brother or brothers
was probably a moral mythus representing the result of
the invention of armour, and analogous to the story of
the mutua! destruction of the men in brazen armour, who
sprang from the dragon's teeth sown by Cadmus a~?~ Jas~n.
It is remarkable that the name of the first fratnc1de Sig-
nifies a ' lance,' and in Arabic a • smith.'
"4· The worship of the Cabiri prevailed <~:lso in lmbr~.
near the entrance of --the He!Jespont. which makes 1t
probable that the great gods in the neighbouring i~land
of Samothracc were of the same origin. The Cabiri, Cu-
retes, and Corybantes appear to ha-:re represented _air as
well as fire. This island was inhab1ted by Pelasg1, who
may have derived from the neighbour~1g count~y of Thrace
and Phrygia, and with the old Pelasgtc mystenes of Ceres.
Hence the various explanations given of the Samothracan
deities, and the number of them so differently stated, some
makir.g them two. some four, some eight, the latter agree-
ing \\ith the number of early Egyptian gods !llent~o!led
by Herodotus. It is still probable that therr ongmal
number was two from their identif1cation with the Dios-
curi and Tyndarida:, and from t~e. number of the Pat;c~i
on Pha:nician vessels. The add1hon of Vulcan as tberr
father or brother made them three, and a fourth may have
been their mother Cabira.
" 5· The Samothracian divinities continued to be held
in high veneration in !ate times, but are com_mon~y spoken
of in connection with navigation, as the twm D10scun or
Tyndarid;e · on the other hand the Dioscuri are spoken of
as the Curetcs or Corybantes. ThecoinsofTripolis exhibit
the spears and star of the Dioscuri," ith lhe legend' Cabiri.'
" 6. The Roman Pc.nates have been identified with
the Dioscuri, and Dionysius states that he bad seen two
figures of ancient workmanship, r~pres~nti~g :l:'ouths armed
with spears, which, from an antique mscnptlon on them,
he knew to be meant for Penates. So, the 'Lares ' of
Etruria and Rome.
" 7· The worship of the Cabiri furnishes the key to
the wanderin!rS of }Eneas, the foundation of Rome, and
the War of Tr~y itself, as well as the Argonautie expeditio!l.
Samothrace and the Troad were so closely connected m
this worship, that it is difficult to judge in which of the
two it originated and the gods of Lavinium, the supposed
colony from Tr~y. were Samothracian. Also ~he Palla-
dium, a pigmy image, was connected at once w1th JEneas
and the Troad with Rome, Vesta, and the Penates, and
the religious b~lief and traditions of several towns in lhe
south of Italy. l\'lr. Kenrick also recognises a mythical
personage in .Eneas, whose attribute~ were d~ved fr~m
those of the Cabiri, and continues w•th some mteresbng
Cablrl 84 Cretulum
observations on the HomPric fables. He concludes that
the essential part of the \\"ar of Troy originated in the
desire to connect together and exphin the traces of an
ancient religion. It fine, he. no.tcs o~e other remarka_ble
circumstance, that the countne~ m wh1ch theSam~thrac1an
and Cabiriac worship prevailed were peopled etther by
the Pelas~ti. or by the ~olians, who of all the tribes com-
prehended under the general name Hellenes, approac~
the most nearly in antii)Uitv and language to the Pela.sgt
''Ve seem warranted, the, (our author obsen-es), in two
conclusions ; first that the Pc1:1.sgian tribes in Italy, Greece
and Asia were united in times re:1ching high above the
commencement of history, by community of religious ide~
and rites, as well as letters, arts, and language ; and,
secondly, that large portion~ of what is calle~ the he.roic
history of Greece, arc nothmg else than ficttons densed
to account for the trnces of this affinity, when time and
the ascendancy of other nations had destroyed t~e .Pri.m-
itive connection, and rendered the cause of the Simtlanty
obscure. The original derivation of the Cabiriac system
from Phrenicia and Egypt is a less certain, though still
highly probable conclusion.
" 8. The name Cabiri has been very generally deduced
the Phrenician 'mighty ' and this etymology is in accor-
dance with the fact that the gods of Samothrace were
called • Divi potes.' l\Ir. Kenrick believes, however, that
the Phccnicians used some other name which the Greeks
translated' Kabeiros,' and that it denoted the two elements
of fire and wind_"
Pococke in his India in Greece will have it that the Cabi;i
are the 'Khyberi" or people of the " Kh}•ber," or a Bud-
dhist tribe-a totally unltkoly origin for them_
the elder of whom are next introduced in the' Generations.'
Finally, Sancnniathon settles Poseidon (Neptune) and
the Cal>i~i at B<'rytus ; but not till circumsision, the sac-
rifice of human beings, and the portrayal of the gods had
been introduced. In recording this event, the Cabiri are
cal.!ed husbandmen and fishermen, which leads to the
presumption that the pl'ople who worshipped those ancient
gods were at length called by their name.
But little is known restarding the method~ of initiation:-
" The C.'\ndidate for imtiation was crowned with a garland
of olive, and wore a purple band round his loins. Thus
attired, and prepared by secret ceremonies (probably mes-
meric\, he was seated on a throne brilliantly lighted, and
the other initiatos then danced round him in hierogl}'phic
measures. It may be imagined that solemnities of this
nature would easily de:1:encrate into orgies of the most
itnmoral tendency, as the ancient faith and reverence for
sacred things perished, and such was really thr case. Still,
the primitive in~titution was ~ure in form and beautiful
in its mystic signification, wluch passed from one ritual
to another, till its last ~tlimmer expired in the freema-
sonry of a very recent period. The :;eneral idea represented
was the passage through death to a higher life. and while
the outwMd senses were held in the thrall of magnetism,
it is probabll' that revelations, good or evil, were made
to the high priests of these ceremonies."
It is extremely difficult to arrive at any scientific coo-
elusion regarding the origin of the Cabiri, but, to summarise,
they were prob;1bly of Semitic origin, arriving in Greece
through Phrenician influence ; and that they approximated
in character to the gods with whom the Greeks identified them
is extremelylikl'ly. (SeeStrabo,L. JO; Varro, DeLinguaLatina,
L. 4; Herodotus, L. J, c. 37; Eusebius, Praep Evang;
Pausanius, L. 9; Bryant, Antimt Mytho!ogy. Vol. liT.)
Cacodaemons : Deities of inferior rank, one of whom it was
believed by many was attached to each mortal from his
birth as a constant companion, and were capable of giving
intpulses, and acting c\s a sort of messeng£'r betv.-een the
gods and men. The cacodai!»JOIIS were of a hostile nature,
as opposed to the agathodaemons who were friendly. It
is said that one of the cacodaemons who appeared to Cassius
was a man of huge stature, and of a black hue. The belief
in these daemons is probably traditional, and it is said
that they arc the rebellious angels who were expelled from
heaven for their crimes. They tried, but in vain, to obtain
a settlement in various parts of the universe; and their
final abode is believed to bo all the space between the
earth and the stars. There they abide, hated by all the
elements, and finding their p!easure in revenge and injury.
Their king was called Hades by the Creeks, Typhon by the
Egyptians, and Ahrimanes by the Persians and Chaldreans.
Cacodemon : The name given by the anctents to an evil
spirit. He changed his shape so frequently that no one
could tell in what guise he most generally appeared to
mao. Each person was also supposed to have a good and
bad genius, the evil being the cacodemo,t. Tho astrologers
also called the twelfth house of the sun, which is regarded
as evil, that of cacod~mo11.
Caetomlte : A marvellous stone, said to possess occult prop-
erties, which was known to the ancients, and which was
probably the carnelian. Any one wearing it was supposed
to be assured of victory in battle.
In the Generations of Sanconiathon, the Cabiri are
claimed for the Phreoicians, though we understand the
whole mystically. The myth proceeds thus. Of the Wind
and the Night were born two mortal men, iEon and Proto-
gonus- The immediate descendants of these were, ·Genus '
and •Genea,•man and woman To Genus were born three
mortal children, Phos, Pur, and Phlox, who disco,·ered
fire, and these again begat " sons of vast bulk and lteight,
w_hose names were given to the .nountains in which they
dwelt, Cassiul, Libanus, Antilibanus, and Brathu. The
issue of these giant men by their own mothers were :1!cin-
rumus, Hypsuranius, and Usous. Hypsuranius inhabited
Tyre ; and Usous becoming a huntsman, consecrated two
pillars to fire and the wind, with the blood of the wild
beasts that h~: captured. In times long subsequent to
these, the race of Hypsuranius gave being to Agreus and
Halieus, inventors, it is said, of the arts of hunting and
fishing. From these descended two brothers, one of whom
was Chrysor or Hepha:stus; in words, charms and
divinations ; he also invented boats, and was the first
that sailed. His brother first built walls with bricks, and
their descendants in the second generation seem to have
completed the invention of houses, by the addition of
courts, porticos, and crypts. They are called Aletre and
Titans, and in their time began husbandry and hunting
with dogs. From the Titans descendedAmynus, a builder,
and Magus, who taught men to construct villages
and tend flocks; and of these two were begotten l\lisor
(perhaps )1izraim), whose name signifies Well-freed ; and
Sydic, whose name denotes the Just ; these found the
use of salt. We now come to the important point in this
line of wonders. From Misor descended Taautus (Thoth,
Athothis, or Hermes Trismegistus), who invented letters;
and from Sydic descended the Dioscuri, or Cabiri, or Cory-
bantes, or Samothraces. These, according to Sanconia-
thon, first built a complete ship, and others descended
irom them who discovered medicine and charms. All
this dates prior to Babylon and the gods of Paganism,
Caer : The daughter of Ethal Anubal, Prince of the Danaans
of Connaught, and mentioned in Irish myths. It was
said that she lived year about in the form of a maiden and
of a swan. She was beloved by Angus Og, who also found
himself transformed into a swan ; and all who heard the
rapturous son& of the swan-lovers were plunged into a
deep sleep, lastmg for three days and nights.

Cagliostro 85
Cagllostro : one o! the greatest occult figures of all time. It
was the fashion during the latter hal! of the XIXth century
to regard Cagliostro as a charlatan and impostor, and this
point of view was greatly aided by the savage attack per-
petrated on his memory by Carlyle, who alluded to him
as the " Prince of Quacks." Recent researches. however,
and especially those made by Mr. W. R. H. Trowbridge
in his Cagliostro: the Splendour a11d i\fisery of a Master
of Magic (1910), go to 3how that if Cagliostro was not a man
of unimpeachable honour, he was by no means the quack
and scoundrel that so many have made him out to be. In
the first place it will be well to give a brief outline of his
life as known to us before :'llr. Trowbridge's exam-
ination of the whole question placed Cagliostro's circum-
stances in a different light, and then to check the details
ofhis career in view of what may be termed lllr. Trowbndge's
discoveries.
We find that Carlyle possessed a strong prejudice in
regard to Cagliostro, and that he made no allowance for
the flagrant mendacity of the documentary evidence re-
garding the so-called magician ; and this leads up to the
fact that although documents and books relating to Cag-
liostro abound, they possess little or no value. An account
compiled from all these sources would present the following
features:
Cagliostro's father whose name is alleged to have been
Peter Balsamo, a person of humble origin, died young, and
his mother, unable to support him, was glad to receive
assistance for this purpose from one of her brothers ; but
from infancy he showed himself averse to proper courses,
and when placed in an religious seminary at Palermo, he
more than once ran away from it, usually to be recaptured
in undesirable company. Sent next to a Benedictine con-
vent, where he was under the care of a Father Superior,
who quickly discovered his natural aptitude, he became
the assistant of an apothecary attached to the convent,
from whom he learned the principles of chemistry and
medicine ; but even then his desire was more to discover
surprising and astonishing chemical combinations than
to gain more useful knowledge. Tiring of the life at last,
he succeeded in escaping from the convent, and betook
himself to Palermo where he associated with rascals and
vagabonds. He was constantly in the hands of the police,
and his kind uncle who tried to assist him was rewarded
by being robbed of a considerable sum. Engaged in every
description of rascal\ty. he was even said to have assisted
in the assassination o! a wealthy canon. At this time it is
asserted that he was only fourteen years of age, but, later,
becoming tired of lesser villainies he resolved upon a grand
stroke, upon which to lay the foundations of his fortunes.
At Palermo resided an avaricious goldsmith named
:Marano, a stupid, superstitious roan who believed devout-
edly in the efficacy of magic. He became attracted to
Cagliostro, who at the age of seventeen posed as being
deeJ?lY versed in occultism, and had been seen evoking
spints. Marano made his acquaintance and confided to
him that he had spent a great deal of money upon quack
alchemists ; but that he was conviDced that in meeting
him (Cagliostro) he had at last chanced upon a real master
of magic. Caglioslro willingly ministered to the man's
superstitions, and told him as a profound secret that in a
field at no great distance from Palermo lay a buried treasure
which, by the aid of magic ceremonies he could absolutely
locate. But the operation necessitated some expensive
preliminaries-at least 6o oz. of gold would be required
in connection with it. To this very considerable sum
Marano demurred, and Cagliostro cooly asserted that he
would enjoy the vast treasure alone. But the credulity
of Marano was too strong for his better sense, and at length
he agreed to furnish the necessary funds.
CagUostro
At midnight they sought the field where it was supposed
the treasure was hid. Cagliostyo proceeded with hts in-
cantations and Marano, terrified at their dreadful nature,
fell prostrate on his face, in which position he was un-
mercifully belaboured by a number of scoundrels whom
Cagliostro had collected for that purpose. Palermo rang
v.-ith the affair, but Cagliostro managed to escape to :\Iessina,
where he adopted the titlo of " Count."
It was in thiS town that he first met with the mysterious.
Althotas. He was "'alking one day in the vicinity of the
harbour when he encountered a person of singular dress
and countenance. This man, apparently about fifty years
of age, was dressed as an oriental, with caftan and robes,
and was accompanied by an Albanian greyhound. At-
tracted by his appearance Cl1gliostro saluted him, and after
some conversation the stranger offered to tell the pseudo-
count the story of his past, and ~o reveal what was actua~y
passing in his mind at that moment. Cagliostro was m-
terested and made arrangements for visiting the stranger,
who pointed out to him the house in which he resided,
requesting him to call a little before midnight, and to rap
twice on the knocker, then three times more slowly, when
he would be admitted. At the time appointed Cagliostro
duly appeared and was conducted along a narrow passage
lit by a single lamp in a niche of the wall. At the end of
this was a spacious apartment illuminated by wax candl~s.
and furnished with everyt11ing necessary for the practtce
of alchemy. Althotas expressed him~elf as a b~liever. in
the mutability of physical law rather than of magtc, which
he regarded as a science having fixed laws discoverable
and reducible to reason. IIe proposed to depart for EgYJ>t.
and to carry Cagliostro thither with him-a prop?Sal whi.ch
the latter joyfully accepted. Althotas acquamted htm
with the fact that he possessed no funds, and upon Cag-
liostro's expressing some annoyance at this circumstance
laughed at him, telling him that it was an easy matt~r
for him to make sufficient gold to pay the expenses of theu
voyage. Authorities differ greatly regarding the per-
sonality of Althotas; but we will leave this part of the
Cagliostro mystery for the moment.
Embarking upon a Genoesc ship they duly came to
Alexandria where Althotas told his comrade that he was
absolute!}' ignorant regarding his birth and parentage,
and said that he was much older than he appeared to be,
but that he was in possession of certain se~ret~ fo;, the
preservation of strength and health. " Nothing he
said " astonishes me ; nothing grieves me, save the evils
which I am powerless to prevent ; and I trust t~ reach
in peace the term of my protracted existence." lhs early
years had been passed ncar Tunis on the coast of Barbary.
where he had been the slave of a wealthy Mussulman
pirate. At twelve years of age be spoke Arabic fiucntly,
studied botany, and read the Koran to his master. who
died when Althotas was sixteen. Althotas now found
himself free, and master of a very considerable sum which
bad been bequeathed him by his late owner.. .
Accompanied by Cagliostro he penetrated .tnto Afnca
and the heart of Egypt, visiting tho Pyramtds, makmg
the acquaintance of the priests of dilierent temples, and
receiving from them much hidden knowledge. (The
slightest acquaintance with Egyptian history would have
saved the author of this statement from making such an
absurd anachronism). Following upon their Egyptian
tour, however, they vi!ited the pnncipal kin~doms of
Africa and A5ia, and they are subsequently dtSCovercd
at Rhodes pursuing alchemical. operations. .At Malta
they assisted the Grand-master Pinto, who was mfatuated
with alchemical expetiment:s,and from tbat momentAlthotas
completely disappears-the memoir ofCagliostro merely sta-
ting that during their residence in Malta he passed away.
Cagllostro 86
Cagli{)stro on the death of his comrade repaired to ~aples.
He was in !un.ds, for Pinto had well provide(j. him before
he left Malta. In ~aples he met with a Sicilian prince,
who conceived a stron~ predilection for rus society, and
invited him to his castle near Palermo. This was dan-
gerous ground but Caglio~tro was not~~ng if not courageou~.
and besides he was cunous to revtslt the haunts of his
youth. He had not been long in Palermo when one day
he travelled to Messina where he encountered by chance
one of his confederates in the affair of Marano the gold-
smith. This man warned rum strongly not to enter the
town of Palermo, and finally persuaded rum to return
to Naples to open a gambling-ho~.:se for the plucking of
wealthy foreigners. Tlus scheme the pair carried out,
but the Xeapo!itan authorities regarded them with such
grave suspicion that they betook themseh·es to the Papal
States. Here they parted company, and regarding this
time the alleged memoir of Caglinstro is not very clear.
It however leads us to belie\'e that the so-called Count
had no lack of dupes, and ·from this obscurity he emerge~
at Rome where we find him established as an empiric,
retailing specifics for all the diseas~::~ that flesh is h<'ir to.
Money flowed in upon him, and he lived in considerable
luxury.
It was at this time that he met the young and beautiful
Lorenza Feliciani, to whom Tte proposed marriage ; her
father dazzled by Caglioslro's apparent wealth and im-
portance consented, and the marriage took place with
some ceremony. All biographers of Cagliostro agree in
stating that Lorenza was a thoroughly gvod woman, honest,
devoted and modest. The most dreadful accusations
have been made concerning the manner in which Cagliostro
treated his wife, and it has been alleged that he thoroughly
ruined her character and corrupted her mind. But we
shall discover later that this account has been coloured
by the unscrupulous imagination of the Jesuitical writers
of the Roman Inquisition. All biographers agree that
Ca~>liostro hastened his wife's ruin, but it is difficult to
kn~w how they came by their data ; and m any case they
disagree substantially in their details. Cagliostro's resi-
dence now became the resort of card-sharpers and other
undesirables, and it is s:~oid that he himse!f assumed the
title and uniform of a Prussian colonel ; but he and his
confederates quarrel!ed and with his wife he was forced
to quit Rome with a so-caltcd :\Iarquis D'Agriata. They
took tl:e road to Venice, and re:~ochcd Bergamo, wruch
through their rogueries they had spv:1d.ily to leave. They
then made the best of their way through Sardinia and
Genoa, and indeed spent several years in wandering through
Southern Europe. At !aft they arrived in Spain by way of
Barcelona, where they tarried for six months. proceeding
afterwards to Madrid and Lisbon. From Lisbon they
sailed to England, where Caglioslro lived upon his wits,
duping certain foreigner~. An English life of Cagliostro
gives an account of his adveulures in London, and tel!s
how he was robbed of a large sum in plate, jewels and
money ; how he hired apartments in Whitcomb Street,
where he spent most of his time in studying chemistry
and physics, giving away much money and comporting
himself generously and decently on all sides.
In I 772 he returned to France with his wife and a certain
Duplaisir. At this time it is said that Duplaisir eloped
with Lorenza, and that Cagliostro obtaining an order for
her arrest, she was imprisoned in a penitentiary, where
she was detained for several months. On her release, it
is alleged, an immediate reconciliation occurred between
husband and wife. At this time Caglioslro had attracted
much attention in Paris by his alchemical successes. It
was the period of myHic enthusiasm in Europe, when
princes, bishops, and the nobility generally were keen to
Cagliostro
probe the secrets o! nature, and when alchemy and the
allied sciences were the pursuits and hobbies of the great.
But according to his Italian biographer Cagliostro went
too far ann ra1sed such hopes in th~:: breasts of his dupes
that at last they entertained suspicions of his honesty, so
that he w~ forced to flee to Drussels, whence he made rus
way to his native town of Palermo, where he was speedily
arrested by the goldsmith :Marano. A ccrt::.in nobleman,
however, interested himself on his behalf, and procured
his release, and he embarked with his wife who bad accom-
panied him, for Malta. From that island they soon retired
to Naples, and from there to Marseilles and Barcelona.
Their progress was marked by considerable state, and
having cheated a certain alchemist of roo,ooo crowns under
the pretence of achieving some alchemical secret, they
hurried to England.
It was during his second visit to London that the Count
was initiated into Masonry. and conceived his great idea
of employing that system for his own behoof. With this
grand object in view be incessantly visited the various
London Lod"CS, and ingrati:~oted himself with their prin-
cipals and officials. At this period he is said to have picked
up in an obscure London bookstall a curious manuscript
which is said to have belonged to a certain George Gaston,
concerning whom nothing is known. Tbis document dealt
with the mysteries of Egyptian Masonry, and abounded
in magical and mystical references. It was from this, it
is alleged, that Cagliostro gathered his occult inspirations.
He studied it close!y and laid his plans carefully. After
another and somewhat harassed tour through Holland,
Italy and Germany, he paid a visit to the celebrated Count
de St. Germain. In his usual eccentric manner, St. Ger-
main arranged their meeting for tho hour of two in the
morning, at which time Cagliostro and his wife, robed in
white garments, and tinctured by girdles of rose colour,
presented themselves before the Count's temple of mystery.
The drawbridge was lowered, and a man of exceptional
height led them into a dimly lighted apartment where
folded doors sprang suddenly open, and they beheld a
temple illuminated by hundreds of wax lights. The Count
of St. Germain sat upon the altar, and at his feet two aco-
lytes swung golden censers. In the Lives of the Alchemys-
tical Philosophers this interview is thus detailed. " The
divinity bore upon his breast a diamond pentagram of
almost intolerable radiance. A majestic statue, white
and diaphanous, upheld on the steps of the altar a vase
inscribed, · Elixir of Immortality,' wrule a vast mirror
was on the wall, a;'ld before it a living being, majestic as
the statue, walked to and fro. Above the mirror were
these singular words-' Store House of \Vandering Souls.'
The most solemn silence prevailed in this sacred retreat,
but at length a voice, winch seemed hardly a voice, pro-
nounced these words- ' \Vho are you ? Whence come you ?
What would you ?' Then the Count and Countess Cag-
liostro prostrated them~elves, and the former answered
after a long pause, • I come to invoke the God of the faith-
ful, the Son of Nature, the Sire of Truth. I come to de-
mand of him one of the fourteen thousand seven hundred
secrets which are tre:~osured in his breast, I come to proclaim
myself his slave, his apostle his martyr.'
·• The divinity did not respond, but after a long ~ilence,
the same voice asked :-' What does the partner of thy
long wande~ings intend ?'
"·To obey and to serve,' answered Lorenza.
" Simultaneously with her words, profound darkness
succeeded the glare of light, uproar fo!lo\\ed on tranquillity,
terror on trust, and a sharp and menacing voice cried
loudly :-' Woe to those who cannot staud the tests .'
·• Husband and wife were immediately separated to
undergo their respective trials, which they endured with
Cagliostro 87
exemplary fortitude. and which are detailed in the text
of their memoirs. When the romantic mummery '"as
over, the two postulants were led back into the
temple with the promise of admission to the divine
mysteries. There a man mysteriously draped in a long
mantle cried out to them :-' Know ye that the arcanum
of our great art is the government of mankind, and that
the one means to rule them is never to tel! them the truth.
Do not foolishly regulate your actions according to the
rules of common sense ; rather outrage reason and cour-
ageously maintain every unbelievable absurdity. Re-
member that reproduction is the pa!mary active power in
nature, politics and society alike ; that it is a mania with
mortals to be immortal, to know the future without under-
standing the present, and to be spiritual while all that
surrounds them is mntcrial.'
" After this harangue the orator genuflected devoutly
before the divinity of the temple and re~ired. At the
same moment a man of gigantic stature led the countess
to the feet of the immortal Count de St. Germain who thus
spoke:-
.. ' Elected from my tenderest youth to the things of
greatness, I employed myself in ascertaining the nature
of veritable glory. Politics appeared to me nothing but
the science of deception, tactics the art of assassination,
philosophy the ambitious imbecility of complete irration-
ality ; physics line fancies about Nature and the continual
mistakes of persons suddenly transplanted into a country
which is utterly unknown to them ; theology the science
of the misery which results from human pride ; history
the melancholy spectacle of perpetual perfidy and blun-
dering. Thence I concluded that the statesman was a
skilful liar, the hero an il!ustrious idiot, the philosopher
an eccentric creature, the physician a pitiable and blind
man, the theologian an anatica! ped:~gogue, and the his-
torian a word-monger. Then did I he:tr of the divinity
of this temple. I cast my cares upon him, with my in-
certitudes and aspirations. When he took possession of
my soul he caused me to perceive all objects in a new light;
I began to read futurity. This universe so limited, so
narrow, so desert, was now enlarged. I abode not only
with those who are, but with those who were. He united
me to the loveliest women of antiquity. I found it em-
inently delectable to know all without studying anything,
to dispose of the tre:LSures of the earth without the so-
licitations of monarchs, to rule the e.:e:nents rather than
men. Heaven made me liberal; I have sufficient to
satisfy my taste ; all that surrounds me is rich, loving,
predestinated.
•· \Vhen the service was finished the costume of ordinary
life was resumed. A superb repast terminated the cere-
mony. During the course of the banquet the two guests
were informed that the Elixir of Immortality was merely
Tokay coloured green or red according to the necessities
of the case. Several essential precepts were enjoined upon
them, among others that they must detest, avoid, and
calumni:lte men of understanding, but flatter, foster, and
blind fools, that they must spread abroad with much
mystery the intelligence that the Count de St. Germain
was five hundred years old, and that they must make
~old, but dupes bc.fore all."
There is no good authority for this singular interview,
but if it really occurred it only probably served to confirm
Cagliostro in the projects he had mapped out for himself.
Travel!ing into Courland, he aud his wife succeeded
in establishing several l\lasonic Lodges according to the
rite of what he called Egyptian Freemasonry. Persons
of high rank flocked around the couple, and it is even said
~at he plotted for the sovereignty of the Grand Duchy.
:Be this as it may, it is alleged that he collected a very large
Cagliostro
treasure of presents and money, and ret out for St. Peters-
burg, where he established himself as a phydcian.
A large number of cures have been credited to Cagliostro
throughout his career, and his methods have been the
subject of considerable controversy. But there is little
doubt that the basis of them was a species of mesmeric
influence. It has been said that he trusted simply to the
laying on of hands ; that he charged nothing for hi~ ser-
vice~ ; that most of his time was occupied in treating the
poor, among whom he distributed vast amounts of money.
The source of this "ealth was said to have been derived
from the :\lasonic Lodges, with whose :LSsistance and Coun-
tenance he had undertaken this work.
Returning to Germany he was received in most of the
towns through which he passed as a benefactor of the
human race. Some regarded his cures as miracles, other:
as sorceries, while he himself assl'rted that they were
effected-by celestial aid.
For three years Cagliostro remained at Strasburg, fHed
and lauded by all. 1Ie formed a stron~ friendship with
the famous Cardinal-archbishop, the Prince de Rohan
who was fired by the idea of achieving alchemical successes.
Rohan was extremely credulous, and leaned greatly to
the marvellous. Cagtiostro accomplished supposed trans-
mutations under his eyes, and the Prince delighted with
the seeming successes lavished immense sume upon the
Count. He even believed that the elixir of life was known
to Cagtiostro and built a small house in which he was to
undergo a physical regeneration. V'.'h<"n he had sucked
the Prince almost dry, Cagliostro repaired to Bordeaux,
proceeding afterwards to Lyons, where he occupied him-
self with the foundation of headquarters for his Egyptian
:Masonic rite. IIe now betook himself to Paris. where he
assumed the role of a master of practical magic, and where
it is said he evoked phantoms which he caused to appear
at the wish of the enquirer in a vase of clear water, or
mirror. :\Ir. Waite thmks in this connection that fraud
wa~ an impossibility, and appears to lean to the theory
that the visions evoked by Ca1,liostro were such as occur
in crystal-gazing, and that no one was more astonished
than the Count himself at the results he obtained. Paris
rang with his name and he won the appellation of the
•· Divine Caglioslro." Introduced to the Court of Louis
XVI. he succeeded in evoking apparitions in mirrors be-
fore many spectators-these including many deceased
persons specialty selected by those prest.nt. His residence
was isolated and surrounded by gardens, and here he es-
tablished a laboratory. His wife afiected great privacy,
and only appeared in a diaphanous costume at certain
hours, before a very select company. This hEightened
the mystery surrounding them, and the elite of Parisian
society vied with one another to be present at their magic
suppers, at which the evocation of the i!lustriou~ dead
was the principal amusement. It is even stated that
deceased statesmen, authors and nobles took their seats
at Cagliostro's supper-table.
But the grand objEct of Caglioslro appears to have been
the spread of his Egyptian Masonic rite. The lodges which
he founded were androgynal, that is they admitted both
men and women ; the ladies being instructed by the Mas-
ter's wife. who figured as the Grand Mistress of the Order
-her husband adopting the title of Grand Copt. There
is little doubt that a good deal of money was subscribed
by the neophytes of the various lodges : the ladies who
joined, each sacrificing on the altar of mysticism no less
than JOO louis; and Cagliostro's immense wealth, which
has never been doubted by any authority on his life, in
the strictest probability found its source in the numerous
gifts which showered in upon him from the powerful and
wealthy for the purpose of furthering his masonic schemes.
Cagliostro 88
But although he lived in considerable magnificence, Cag-
liostro by no means led a life of abandoned luxury ; for
there is the best evidence that he gave away vast sums
to the poor and needy, that he attended the sick hand and
foot, and in short played the part of healer and reformer
at one and the same time.
A great deal of mystery surrounded the doings of the
Egyptian Masonry in its headquarters in the Faubourg
Saint Honore, and the seances for initiation took place
at midnight. Figuier and the .Marquis de Luchet have
both given striking accounts of what occurred during the
female initiations :
" On entering the first apartment," says Figuier, "the
ladies were obliged to disrobe and assume a white garment,
with a girdle of various colours. They were divided into
six groups, distinguished by the tint of their cinctures.
A large veil was also provided, and they were caused to
enter a temple lighted from the roof, and furnished with
thirty-~ix arm-chairs covered with black satin Lorenza
clothed in white, was seated on a species of throne, sup-
ported by two tall figures, so habited that their sex could
not he determined. The light was lowered by degrees
till surrounding objects could scarcely be distinguished,
when the Grand Mistress commanded the ladies to uncover
their left legs as far as thr thigh, and raising the right arm
to rest it on a neighbouring pillar. Two young women
then entered sword in hand, and with ~ilk ropes baund
all the ladies together by the arms and legs. Then after
a period of impressive silence, Lorenza pronounced an
oration, which is given at length, but on doubtful authority,
by several biographers, and which preached fervidly the
emancipation of womankind from the shameful bonds
imposed on them by the lords of creation.
" These bonds were symbolised by the silken ropes from
which the fair initiates were released at the end of the
harangue, when they were conducted into separate apart-
ments, each opening on the Garden, where they had the
most unheard-of experiences. Some were pursued by
men who unmercifully persecuted them with barbarous
solicitations ; others encountered less dreadful admirers,
who sighed in the most languishing postures at their feet.
More than one discovered the counterpart of her own love
but the oath they had all taken nece~sitated the most in-
exorable inhumanity, and all faithfully fulfilled what was
required of them. The new spirit infused into regenerated
woman triumphed along the whole line of the six and
thirty initiates, who with intact and immaculate symbols
re-entered triumphant and palpitating, the twiliaht of
the vaulted temple to receive the congratulations
0
of the
sovereign priestess.
" When they had breathed a little after their trials,
the vaulted roof opened suddenly, and, on a vast sphere
of gold, there descended a man, naked as the unfallen
Adam, holding a serpent in his hand, and having a burning
star upon his head.
" The Grand Mistress announced that this was the genius
of Truth, the immortal, the divine Cagliostro, issued with-
out procreation from the bosom of our father Abraham,
and the depositary of all that hath been, i'>, or shall be
known on the untversal earth. He was there to initiate
them into the secrets of which they had been fraudently
deprived. The Grand Copt thereupon commanded them
to dispen.'le with the profanity of clothing, for if they would
receive truth they mu!t be as naked as itself. ThE sov-
ereign priestess setting the example unbound her girdle
and permitted her drapery to fall to the ground, and the
fair mitiates following her example expored. themselves
in all the n~dity of their charms to the magnetic glance,o;
of the celestial genius, who then commenced his revelations.
" He informed his daughters that the much abused
C
agliostro
magical art was the secret of doing good to humanity.
It was initiation into the mysteries of Nature, and the
power to make use of her occult force~. The visions wbich
they had beheld in the Garden wher<" so many had Feen
and recognised those who were dearest to their hearts,
proved the reality of hermetic operations. They had
shewn themselves worthy to know the truth ; he under-
took to instruct them by gradations therein. It was enough
at the outset to inform them that the sublime end of that
Egyptian Freemasonry which he had brought from the
very heart of the Orient was the happiness of mankind.
This happiness was illimitable in its nature, including
material enjoyments as much as spiritual peace, and the
pleasures of the understanding.
The Grand Copt at the end of this harangue once more
seated himself upon the sphere of gold and was borne away
through the roof; and the proceedings ended, rather ab-
surdly in a ball. This sort of thing was of co~e as the
breath of his nostrils to Cagliostro, who could not have
existed without the atmosphere of theatrical mysticism,
in which he perfectly revelled.
It was at this period that Cagliostro became implicated
in the extraordinary affair of the Diamond Necklac('. He
had been on terms of great intimacy with the Cardinal
de Rohan. A certain Countess de Lamotte had petitioned
that prince for a pension on account of tong arL<>tocratic
descent. De Rohan was greatly ambitious to become
First Minister of the Throne, but Marie Antoinette, the
Queen, disliked him and stood in the way ofsuch an honour.
Mm Lamotte soon discovered this, and for purposes of
her own told the Cardinal that the Queen favoured hi~ am·
bitions, and either forged, or procured someone els: to
forge, letters to the Cardinal purporting to come from the
Queen, some of which begged for money for a poor family
in which her Majl'~ty was intere~ted. The letters con·
tinued of the be~ing description, and Rohan, .who was
himseU heavily m debt, and had misappropnated the
funds of various institutions, was driven into the hands
of money-lenders. The wretched Countess de Lamotte
met by chance a ~r woman whose resemblance to the
Queen was exceedingly marked. This person she t~ained
to represent Marie Antoinette, ~d a;rranged .rug~tly
meetings between her and Rohan, 10 which the dtsgmsed
woman made all sorts of promises to the Cardinal. Be-
tween them the adventuresses mulcted the unfortunate
prelate in immense sums. Meanwhile a certain Bahmer,
a jeweller, was very desirous of felling a wonderful diamond
necklace in which, for over ten years he had locked up
his whole fortune. Hearing that Mme. de Lamotte had
great infiuence with the Que~n. he app~oachcd. her for
the purpose of getting her to mduce Mane Antomette to
purchase it. She at once corresponded with De Rohan
on the matter, who came post haste to J?aris, t? be told
by Mme. de Lamotte that the Queen wiShed him to be
security for the purchase of the necklace, for which she
had agreed to pay t,6oo,ooo livres, or £64,000, in four
half-yearly instalments. He was naturally staggered
at the suggestion but however, affixed his signature to
the agreement, and Mme. de Lamotte became the possessor
of the necklace. She speedily broke it up, picking the
jewels from their setting with an ordinary penknife. Mat-
ters went smoothly enough until the date when the first
instalment of 400,000 livres became due. Do Rohan,
never dreaming that the Queen would not meet it, could
not lay his hands on such a sum, and Bahmer noting his
anxiety mentioned the matter to one of the Queen's ladies-
in-waiting, who retorted that he must be mad, as the Queen
had never purchased the necklace at all He went at
once to Mme. de Lamotte who laughed at him, said he
was being fooled, that it bad nothing to do with her, and
Cagliostro 89
told him to go to the Cardinal. The terrified jeweller did
not however take her advice, but went to the King.
The amazed Louis XVI. listened to the story quietly
enough, and then turned to the Queen who was present,
who at once broke forth in a tempest of indignation. As
a matter of fact B!hmer had for years pestered her to buy
the necklace, but the cro,ming indignity was that De
Rohan, whom she cordially detested, should have been
made the medium for such a scandalous disgrace in con·
nection with her name, and she at once gave directions
that the Cardinal should be arrested. The King acquiesced
in this, and shortly afterwards the Countess de Lamotte,
Cagliostro and his wife, and others, followed him to the
Bastille.
The trial which followed was one of the mos1: sensational
and stirring in the annals of French history. The King
was greatly blamed for allowing the affair to become pub·
lie at all, and there is little doubt that such conduct as
the evidence displayed as that of aristocrats assisted to
hasten the French Revolution.
It .vas Mme. de Lamotte who charged Cagliostro with
the robbery of the necklace, and she did not hesitate to
invent for him a terrible past, designating him an empiric,
alchemist, false prophet, and Jew. This is not the place
to deal with the trial at length, and it wiJJ suffice to state
that Cagliostro easily proved his complete innocence. But
the Parisian public looked to Cagliostro to supply the
comedy in this great drama, and assuredly they were not
disappointed, for he provided them with what must be
described as one of the most romantic and fanciful, if
manifestly absurd, life stories in the history of autobi·
ography. His account of himself which is worth quoting
at length is as follows :-
"I cannot," he says, "speak positively as to the place
of my nativity, nor to the parents ..who gave me birth.
All my inquiries have ended only in giving me some great
notions, it is true, but altogether vague and uncertain,
concerning roy family.
" I spent the years of my childhood in the city of Medina
in Arabia. There I was brought up under the name of
Acharat, which 1 preserved during my progress through
Africa and Asia. I had my apartments in the palace of
tbe Muphti Salahaym. It is needless to add that the
Muphti is the chief of the Mahometan religion, and that
his constant residence is at Medina.
" I recollect perfectly that 1 had then four persons at·
tached to my service : a governor, between forty-five
and sixty years of age, whose name was Althotas, and
three servants, a white one who attended me as valet de
chambre and two blacks, one of whom was constantlyabout
me night and day.
" My governor always told me that I had been left an
orphan when only about three months old, that my parents
were Christians and nobly born ; but be left me absolutely
in the dark about their names and the place of my nativity.
Scime words, however, which he let fall by chance have
induced ms to suspect that I was born at Malta. AlthOta$,
whose name 1 cannot speak without the tenderest emotion,
t reated me with great care and all the attention of a father.
He thought to develope the talent I displayed for the sci·
ences. I may truly say that he knew them all, from the
most abstruse down to those of mere amusement. My
greatest aptitude was for the study of botany and
chemistry.
" By him I was taught to worship God, to love and
assist my neighbours, and to respect everywhere religion
and the laws. We both dressed like Mahometans and
conformed outwardly to the worship of Islam : but the
true religion was imprinted in our hearts.
" The Muphti, who often visited me, always treated me
Cagllostro
with great goodness and seemed to entertain the highest
regard for my governor. The latter instructed me in most
of the Eastern languages. He would often converse with
me on the pyramids of Egypt, on those vast subterraneous
caves dug out by the ancient Egyptians, to be the repository
of human knowledge and to shelter the precious trust
from the injur:es of time.
"The desire of travelling and of beholding the wonders
of which he spoke grew so strong upon me, that Medina
and my youthful sports there lost all the allurements I
Lad found in them before. At least, when l was in my
twelfth year, Althotas informed me one day that we were
going to commence our travels. A caravan was prepared
and we set out, after having taken our leave of the Muphti
who was pleased to express his concern at our departure
in the most obliging manner.
"On our arrival at Mecca we alighted at the palace of
the Cherif. Here Althotas provided me with sumptuous
apparel and presented me to the Cherif, who honoured me
with the most endearing caresses. At sight of this prince
my senses experienced a sudden emotion, which it is not
in the power of words to oxp~s. and my eyes dropped
the most deliciou~ tears I have ever shed in my life. His,
I perceived, he could hardly contain.
" I remained in Mecca for the space of three years; not
a day passed without my being admitted to the sovereign's
presencC', and every hour increased his attachment and
added to my gratitude. I sometimes surprised his gaze
riveted upon me, and turned to heaven with every ex-
expression of pity and commiseration. Thoughtful, I
would go from him a prey to an ever-fruitless curiosity.
I dared not question Althotas, who always rebuked me
with great severity, as if it had been a crime in me to
wish for some information concerning my parents and the
place where I was born. I attempted in vain to g<t the
secret from the negro who slept in my apartment. If I
chanced to talk of my parents he would tum a deaf ear
to my questions. But one night when I was more pressing
than usual, he told me that if ever I should leave :\fecca
l was threatened with the greatest misfortunes, and bid
me. above all, beware of the city of Tref>Uond.
" My inclination, however, ~ot the better of his fore-
bodings-! was tired of the umformity of life T led at the
Cherif's court. One day when I was alone the prince en·
tered my apartment; he strained me to his bosom with
more than usual tenderness. bid me never cease to adore
the Almighty, and added, bedewing my cheeks with his
tears: 'Nature's ""fortunate child, adieu!'
"This was our last intf.'rview. The caravan waited
only for me and 1 set off, leaving ?l!ecca never to re-enter
it more
" I directed my course first to Egypt, where I inspected
these celebrated p·yramids which to the eye of the super·
ficial observeF only appear an enormous mass of marble
and granite. I also got acquainted with the priests of
the various temples, who had the complacence to introduce
me into such places as no ordinary traveller ever entered
before. The next three years of my progress were spent
in the principal kingdoms of Africa and Asia. Accompanied
by Althotas, and the three attendants who continued in
my service, I arrived in 1766 at the ioland of Rhodes, and
there embarked on a French ship bound to Malta.
"Notwithstanding the general rule by which all vessels
coming from the Levant are obliged to enter quaran~ne,
I obtained on the second day leave to go ashore. Pmto,
the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, gave us apart·
ments in his palace, and 1 perfectly recollect that mine
wore near the laboratory.
" Tho first thing the Grand Master was pleased to do
was to request the Chevalier d'Aquino, of the princely
Cagliostro 90
house of Caramanica, to bear me company and do me the
honours of the island. It was here that I firet assumed;
European dress and with it the name of Count Cagliostro,
nor was it a small matter of surprise to me to see Althotas
appear in a clerical dress with the insignia of the Order
of ~lalta.
" I have every reason to believe that the Grand Ma~ter
Pinto was acquainted with my real origin. He often spoke
to me of the Cherif and mentioned the city of Trebizond,
but never would consent to enter into further particulars
on the subject. Meanwhile he treated me with the utmost
distinction, and assured me of very rapid preferment if I
would consent to take the cross. But my taste for trav-
elling and the predominant desire of practising medicine,
induced me to decline an offer that was as generous as
it was honourable.
" It was in the island of :\Ialta that I had the misfortune
of losing my best friend and master, the wisest as well as
the most !earned of men. the venerable Althotas. Some
minutes before he expired, pressing my hand, he said in
a feeble voice, ' My son, keep for ever before your eyes
the fear of Cod and the love of your fellow-creatures; you
will soon be convinced by experience of what you have
been taught by me.'
" The spot where I had parted for ever from the friend
who had been as a father to me, soon became odious. I
begged leave of the Grand :Master to quit the island in
order to travel over Europe ; he consented reluctantly,
and the Chevalier d'Aquino was so obliging as to accom-
pany me. Our first trip was to Sicily, from thence we
went to the different islands of the Greek Archipelago,
and returning, arrived at .Naples, the birthplace of my
companion.
" The Chevalier. owing to his privateaffairs, being obliged
to undertake a private journey, I proceeded alone to Rome,
provided with a letter of credit on the banking house of
Signor Bellone. In the capital of the Christian world I
resolved upon keeping the strictest i11cogm'to. One morn-
ing, as I was shut up in my apartment, endea....·ouring to
impro'l.·e myself in the Italian language, my 11alet de chambre
introduced to my presence the secretary of Cardinal Orsini,
who requested me to wait on his Eminence. I repaired
at once to his palace and was received with the most Bat-
tering civility. The Cardinal often invited me to his table
and procured me the acquaintance of several cardinals
and Roman princes, amongst others, Cardinals York and
Ganganelli, who was afterv.·ards Pope Clement XIV. Pope
Rezzonico, who then filled the papal chair, having ex-
pressed a desire of seeing me, I had the honour of frequent
interviews with his Holiness.
" I was then (1770) in my twenty-second ye<j.r, when
by chance I met a young lady.of quality, Seraphina Feli-
ciani, whose budding charms kindled in my bosom a flame
which sixteen years of marriage have only sen·ed to
strengthen. It is that unfortunate woman, whom neither
her virtues, her innocence, nor her quality of stranger
could save from the hardships of a captivity as cruel as
it is unmerited."
Cagliostro is reticent regarding his life between the period
last dealt with, and the date of his coming to Paris. But
although proved innocent he had through his ver) inno-
cence offended so many persons in high places that he was
banished. amidst shouts of laughter from everyone in the
(;Ourt. Even the judges were convulsed, but on his return
from the court-house the mob cheered him heartily. If
he bad accomplished nothing else he had at least won
the hearts of the populace by his kindness and the many
acts of faithlul service he had lavished upon them, and
it was partly to his popularity, and partly to the violent
.hatred of the Court, that he owed the reception accorded
Cagliostro
to him. He was re-united to his wife. and shortly after-
wards took his departure for London where he ·was received
with considerable eclat. Here he addressed a letter to
the people of France, which obtained wide circulation and
predicted the French Revolution, the demolishment of
the Bastille, and the downfall of the monarchy. Following
upon this the Courier de l'Europe a French paper published
in London, printed a so-called exposure of the real life of
Cagliostro from beginning to end. From that moment,
howevH, his descent was headlong; his reputation had
Switzerland and Austria, he could find no rest for the sole
of hi!' foot. At last he carne to Rome, whither Lorenza,
his wife accompanied him. At first he was well received
there, and even entertained by several cardinals, privately
~tudying medicine, and living very quietly: but he made
the grand mistake of attempting to further his masonic
ideas within the bounds of the Papal States. Masonry
was of course anathema to the Roman Church, and upon
his attempting to found a Lodge in the Eternal City itself,
be was arrested on the 27th September, 1789. by order of
the Holy Inquisition, and imprisoned in th~ Castle of Saint
Angelo. Iiis examination occupied his inquisitors for
no less tban eighteen months, and he was sentenced to
death on the 7th April, I 791. He was, however, recom-
mended to mercy, and the Pope commuted his sentence
to perpetual imprisonment in the Castle of Saint Angelo.
On one occasion he made a desperate attempt to escape :
requesting the- services of a confessor he attempted to
strangle the Brother sent to him, but the burly priest,
whose habit he had intended to disguise himself in proved
too strong for him, and he was quickly overpowered.
After this he was imprisoned in the solitary Castle of San
Leo near Montefeltro, the situation of which stronghold
is one of the most singular in Europe, where he died and
was interred in I 795· The manner of his death is abso-
lutely unknown, but an official commissioned by Napoleon
to visit the Ita!ian prisons gives some account of Cagliostro's
quarters there. .
•· The ~;allcries," he re,P<?rt!>, " which have been cut out
of the solid rock, were d1vided into cells, and old dried-up
cisterns had been converted into dungeons for the worst
criminals, and further surrounded by high walls, so that
the only possiule egress, if escape was attempted, would
be by a staircase cut in the rock ;:.nd guarded night and
day by sentinels.
•· It was in one of these ci~terns that the ce~ebrated
Cagliostro was interred in I 79I. In recommending the Pope
to commute the sentence of death, which the Inquisition
had passed upon him, into perpetual imprisonment, the
Holy Tribunal took care that the commutation should
be equivalent to the death penalty. His only communi-
cation with mankind was when hi~ jailers rai!ed the trap
to tet food down to him. Here be languished for three
years without air, movement, or intercourse with his fellow-
creatures. During the last month~ of his life his coudition
excited the pity of the governor, who had him removed
from this dungeon to a cell on the level with the ground,
where the curious, who obtain permission to visit the prison,
may read on the walls various imcriptions and sentences
traced there by the unhappy alchemist. The la•t bears
the date of the 6th of March 1795."
The Countess Cagliostro was also sentenced by the In-
quisition to imprisonment for life. She was confined in
tile Convent of St. Appolonia, a penitentiary for women
in Rome, where it was rumoured that she died in 1794.
Cagliostro's manuscript volume entitled " Egyptian
Freemasonry " fell with his other papers into the hands
of the Inquisition, and was solemnly condemned by it as
subversive to the interests of Chrirtianity. It was pub-
licly burned, but oddly enough the Inquisition set apart

the exercise of his functions, and from which those regu-
Jations and instructions were copied, wherewith he enriche'tl
many mother lodges. ln this treatise, which is written
in French, he promise~ to conduct his dio;ciples to perfection
by means of physical and moral regeneration, to confer
perpetual youth and beauty on them, and restore them
to that state of innocence which they were deprived of
by means of original sin. He asserts that Egyptian Ma-
sonry was first propagated by Enoch and Elias, but that
since that time it has lost much of its purity and splendour.
Common masonry, according to him, has degenerated
into mere buffoonery, and women have of late been entirely
excluded from its mysteries; but the time was now ar-
rived when the Grand Copt was about to restore the glory
of masonry, and allow its benefits to be participated by
both sexes.
" The statutes of the order then follow in rotation, the
division of the members into three distinct classes, the
various signs by which t hey might discover each other,
the officers who are to preside over and regulate the society,
the stated times when the members are to assemble, the
erection of a tribunal for deciding all differences that may
arise between the several lodges or the particular members
of each, and the various ceremonies which ought to take
place at the admission of the candidates. In every part
of this book the pious reader is disgusted with the sacrilege,
the profanity, the superstition, and the idolatry with which
it abounds-the invocations in the name of God, the pros-
trations, the adorations paid to tile Grand Master, the
fumigations, the incense, the exorcisms, the emblems of
the Divine Triad, of the moon, of the sun, of the compass,
of the square; and a thuusand other scandalous particulars,
with which the world is at present acquainted.
·· The Grand Copt, or chief of the lodge, is compared
to God the Father. He is invoked upon every occasion ;
he regulates all the actions of the members and all the
ceremonies of the lodge, and he is even supposed to have
communication with angels and with the Divinity. In
the exercise of many of the rites they arc desired to repeat
the Veni and the Te Dewn-nay, to such an excess of im-
piety arc they enjoined. that in reciting the psalm .i\Jet1te11to
Domine David, the name of the Grand 1\Iastc.:r is always
to be substituted for that of the King of Israel.
.. People of all religions Mc admitted into the society
oJ Egyptian Masonry- the Jew, the Calvinist, the Lutheran
are to be rcceiYed into it as well as the Catholic-provided
they believe in the existence of God and the immortality
of the soul, and have been previously allowed to participate
jn the mysteries of the common masonry. When men
.are admitted, they receive a pair of garters from the Grand
<:opt, as is usual in all lodges, for their mistresses ; and
when women are received into the society, they are pre-
:Sented by the Grand Mistress with a cockade, which they
are desired to give to that man to whom they are most
attached.
.. We shall here recount the ceremonies made use of
on admitting a female.
" The candidate having presented herself, the Grand
Mistress (Madame Cagliostro generally presided in that
capacity) breathed upon her face from the forehead to the
chin, and thtn said, 1 breathe upon you on purpose to
inspire you with virtues which we possess, so that they
Cagliostro
may take root and fiourish in your heart, I thus fortify
your soul, I thus confirm you in the faith of your brethren
and sisters, according to the engagements which you have
contracted with them. We now admit you as a daughter
of the Egyptian lodge. We order that you be acknow-
ledged in that capacity by all the brethren and sisters of
the Egyptian lodges, and that you enjoy with them the
s:1me prerogatives as with ourselves.'
" The Grand :\laster thus addresses the male candidate:
' In virtue of the power which I have received from the
Grand Copt, the founder of our order, and by the particular
grace of Cod, I hereby confer upon you the honour of being
admitted into our lodge in the name of Hellos, Mene, Tetra·
grammaton.'
"In a book said to be printed at Paris in 1789, it is
asserted that the last words were suggested to Caglfostro
as sacred and caba!istical expressions by a pretended con-
juror, who said that he was assisto!d by a spirit, and that
this spirit was no other than a cabalistical Jew, who by
means of the magical art had murdered his own father
before the incarnation of Jesus Christ.
"Common masons have been accustomed to regard St.
John as their patron, and to celebrate tlu: festival of that
s:1int. Cagliostro also adopted him as his protector, and
it is not a little remarkable that he was imprisoned at Rome
on the very festival of his patron. The reason for his
veneration of this great prophet was, if we are to believe
himself, the great similarity between the Apocalypse and
the rites of his institution.
" We must here observe that when any of his disciples
were admitted into tl1e highest class, the following exec-
rable ceremony took place. A young boy or girl, in the
state of virgin innocence and purity, was procured, who
was called the pupil, and to whom power was given over
the seven spirits that surround the throne of their divinity
and preside over tile seven planets. Their names according
to CagliosiYo's book are Anael, Michael, Raphael, Gabriel,
Uriel, Zobiache!, and Anachiel. The pupil is then made
use of as an intermediate agent between the spiritual and
physical worlds, and being clothed in a long white robe,
adorned with a red ribbon, and blue silk festoons, he is
shut cp in a little closet. From that place he gives re-
sponses to the Grand Master, and tells whether the spirits
and ~loses have agreed to receive the candidates into the
highest class of Egyptian masons....
·' In his instructions to obtain the moral and physical
regeneration which he had promised to his disciples, he
is exceedingly careful to give a minute description of the
operations to which they bave to submit. Those who are
desirous of experiencing the moral rcgene.ration .-re to
retire from the world for the space of forty days, and to
distribute their time into certain proportions. Six hours
are to be employed in reflection, three in prayer to the
Deity, nine in the boly operations of Egyptian .Masonry,
while the re:naining period is to be dedicated to repose.
At the end of the tlmty-three days a visible communica-
tion is to take place between the patient and the seven
primitive spirits, and on the morning o! the fortieth day
his soul will be inspired with divine knowledge, at~d his
body be as pure as that of a new-born infant.
" To procure a physical regeneration, the patient is to
retire into the country in the month oJ. May, aud during
forty days is to live according to the most strict and austere
rules, eating very little, and then only laxative and sana-
tive herbs, and making use of no other drink tban distilled
water, or rain that has fallen in the course of.tho month.
On the seventeenth day, after having let blood certain
white drops are to be taken, six at night and six in the
morning, increasing them two a day in progression. In
three days more a small quantity of blood is again to be
cagliostro 92 Cala
let from the arm before sunrise, and the patient is to retire
to bed till the operation is completed. A grain of the
panact" is tllen to be taken ; this panacea is the same as
that of which God created man when He first made him
immortal. When this is swallowed the candidate loses
his speech and his reflection for three entire days, and be
i~ subject to frequent convulsiOnS, struggles, and perspira-
tions. Having recovered from this state, ill which how-
ever, he experiences no pain whatever, on that
day, he takes the third and last grain of the panacea, which
causes him to fall into a profound and tranquil sleep; it
is then that he loses his hair, his skin, and his teeth. These
again are all reproduced in a few hours, and having become
a new man, on the morning of the fortieth day he leaves
his room, enjoying a complete rejuvenescencP, by which
he is enabled to live 5557 years, or to such time as he, of
his own accord, may be desirous of going to the world ol
spirits."
To revert to the question of the researches of :Olr. Trow-
bridge, it will appear to any unbiassed reader of his work
that he has proved that Caglioslro was not the same as
Joseph Balsamo with whom !lis detractor> have identified
him. Balsamo was a Sicilian va~abond adventurer, and
the statement that he and Cagltostro were one and the
~arne person originally rcHs on the word of the editor of
the CouYier de l' Europe, a person of the lowest and most
profligate habits, and upon an anonymous Jetter from
Palermo to "the Chief o{ the Paris police. :\Jr. Trowbridge
sees in the circumstance that the names of the Countess
Caglioslro aud the wife of nalsamo were identical nothing
but a mere coincidence, as the name Lorenza Feliciani is
a very common one in Italy. He also proves that the
testimony of the handw~ting experts as to the remarkable
similarity between the writing of Balsamo and Cagliostro
is '"orthlcss, and states that nobody who had known Bal-
samo eversaw Caglioslro. He also points out that Balsamo,
who bad been in England in 1771, was •· \\anted" by the
London police : how was it then that six years afterward
they did not recognise him in Count Cagliostro who spent
four months in a debtors' prison there, for no fault of his
own ? The whole evidence against Cagliostro's character
rests with the editor of the Courier de l'Ettrope and his
Inquisition biographer, neither of whom can be credited
for various good reasons. Again, it must be recollected
that the narrative of the Inquisition biographer is supposed
to be based upon the confessions of Cogliostro under torture
in the Castle of St. Angelo. Neither was the damaging
disclosure of the editor of the Cot<rier de l'Europe at all
topical, as he raked up matter which was at leaH fourteen
years old, and of which he had no personal h"Dowledge
whatsoever. :.\lr. Trowbridge also proves that the dossier
discovered in the French archives in 1783, which was sup-
posed to embody the Countess Cagliostro's confessions
regarding the career of her husband when she was im-
pnsoned in the SalpetriGre prison, is palpably a for~ery,
and be further disposes of the statements that Coglsostro
lived on the immoral earnings of his wife.
It is distinctly no easy matter to get at the bed-rock
truth regarding Cagliostro or to form any just estimate
of his true character. That he was vain, naturally pom-
pous, fond of theatrical mystery, and of the J?Opular side
of occultism, is most probable. Another c1rcumstance
which stands out in relation to his personality is that be
was vastly desirous of gaining cheap popularity. He was
probably a little mad. On the other hand he was benefi-
cent, and felt it his mission in the then king-ridden state
of Europe to found Egyptian Masonry 1or the protection
of society in general, and the middle a nd lower classes in
particular. A born adventurer, he was by no means a
rogue, as his lack of shrewdness has been proved on many
occasions. There is small question either that the various
Masonic lodges which he founded and which were patron-
ised by persons of ample means, provided him ";th extc;n-
sive funds, and it is a known fact that he was subsidised
by several extremely wealthy men, who, themselves
dissatisfied ";th the state of affairs in Europe, did not
hesitate to place their riches at his disposal for the purpose
of undermining the tyrannic powers which then wielded
sway. There is reason to believe that he bad in some way
and at some period of his life acquired a certain working
knowledge of practical occultism, and that he possessed
certain elementary psychic ·powers of hypnotism and
telepathy. His absurd account of his childhood is almost
undoubtedly a plagiarism of that stated in the first mani-
festo to the public of the mysterious Rosicrucian Brother-
hood, (<}_.v) as containing an account of the childhood of
their Ch1ef. But on the whole he is a mystery, and in all
likelihood the clouds which surround his origin and earlier
years will never be dispersed. It is prob!!bly better that
this should be so, as although Cagliostro was by.no mean~
an exalted character, he was yet one of the most p1cturesque
figures in the later history of Europe; and assuredly not
the least aid to his picturesqueness is the obscurity in which
his origin is involved. Consult-Cagliostro. W. R. H.

Cahagnets' work is notable in many ways. His own good

of his order, who died in 1757 at his abbey of Sesones. He
was the author of a Dictiom:aire de Ia Bible and of many
well-known commentaries on the scriptures. But he is
chiefly famous among occultists for his Dissertation sur

et de SiUsie. (Paris 1746, and I 751-the latter being the
best edition). It was translated into English in 1759,
and is alluded to in the article " Vampire." The greatest
faith in the supernatmal (some might perhaps stigmatise
it as credulity) marks the work. But he notices unfavour-
able theories equally \\oith those which suil his hypotheses,
and if he places too much credence in the classical authors,
he is never dull. He became the butt of Voltaire, who
wrote beneath his portrait in verse of questionable quality:

posed child before him on his ltorse. But he was so heavy
that the animal sank under the weight. Some time after-
wards the mendicant was taken and admitted that the

had trained so carefully that uo one refused him alms

Cambodia : The Cambodia of to-day is bounded by French
Cochin-China, Annam, Siam and the Gulf of Siam. Of
its population of 1,500,000 inhabitants, the main part is
composed of the I<hm~r people, and Chinese, Annamese
Malays and aboriginal elements are also represented.
Magic.-Magic is mixed up to a surprising degree \vith
the daily life of this people. They consult sorcerers upon
the most trivial matters, and are con.~tantly at great pains
to discover whether any small venture is likely to prove
lucky or unlucky. There are two kinds of sorcerers (or
sorceresses), the soothsayers (ap thmop) and the medicine-
sorcerers (kru). Of these the latter enjoy the highest
reputation as healers and exorcists, while the former are
less respected, dealing, as they do in charms and philtres

indulge their spite and hatred. The outcast kru, however,
can be ministers of destruction as well as of healing. One
of the means used to take the life of an enemr is the old
devief? f~vour~d by witches. They make a wax figure of
the vtctim, _pnck 1t at the spot where they wish to harm
hlm, and thus bring disease and death upon him. Another
plan is to take two skulls from which the tops have been
removed, place them against each other, and convey them
secretly under the bed of a healthy man where they have
very evil results. Sometimes by means of spells they
transform wood-shavings or grains of rice into a large
beetle, or into worms, wluch enter the body of their victim
and cause his illness, and, perhaps his death. If the man
thus attacked happens to possess the friendship of a
more powerful sorcerer, however, the latter may afford
him his protection, and thus undo the mischlef,. The
more harmless occupations of the wizards consist in making
philtres and amulets to insure the admiration of women,
the favour of the king, and success at play.
Evil Spirits.-The evil spirits, to whom they ascribe
the most malicious intent, are called pray. Of thes~ the
most felrsome variety is the " wicked dead·· (hhmoc pray),
which includes the spirits of women who have died in
childbed. From their hiding-place in the trees these
spirits torment inoffensive passers-by with their hideous
laughter, and shower down stones upon them. These
practices are, of course, calculated either to kill or to drive
the unfortunate recipients of their attentions insane.
Among the trees there are. also concealed mischievous
demons who inflict terrible and incurable diseases upon
mankind.
Those who have suffered a violent death are also greatly
to be feared. From the nethermost regions they return,
wan and terrible, to demand food from human beings,
who dare not deny it to them. Their name beisac signi-
fies" goblin," and they have the power to inflict all manner
of evil on those who refuse their request. So the good
Cambodian, to avert such happenings, puts his offering of
rice or other food in the brushwood to appease the goblins.
The pray, it may be said, require to have th<.ir offerings
laid on the winnowing fan that enters so largely into
Cambodian superstition.
\\'ere-wolves, both male and female, strike terror into
the hearts of the natives. By the use of certain magical

then, the Cambodians say, she shall recover her reason and
may return home. If, on t he other hand, no such drastic
remedy is to be found, at the end of seven days the woman
shall turn into a tigress. In order to cure men who have
the powers of a were-wolf, one must strike them on the
shoulder with a hook.

of sensation and volition. and the partial suspension of
the vital functions. The body assum<'s a rigid and statues-
que appearance, sometimes mistaken for death, and the
patient remains unconscious throughout· the attack. On
occasion, the cataleptic state may be marked by symptoms
of intense mental excitement, and by apparently volitional
speech and action. Sometimes the symptoms are hardly
distinguishable from thos~ of hysteria. The period
covered by the attack may vary from a few minutes to
several days, though the latter only in. exceptional cases ;
it may, however, recur on trifling provocation in the absence
of resistence from the will-power of the patient. The
affection is caused by a pathological condition of the
nervous system, generally produced by severe or prolonged
mental emotion, and it must not be confused with the
hyj>notic trance. The belief that it may occur in a per·
fectly healthy person is, on the whole, fallacious. There is
some reason to suppose that catalepsy, like ecstacy and
mediumistic faculties, may at times prove contagious.
Dr. Petetin. in his Electricite A nimale (18o8) makes mention
of as many as eight t."lSCS met with in a restricted area,
although catalepsy is in ordinary circumstances of rare
occurrence. Pctetin also mentions certain strange pheno-
mena ·witnessed by him in connection with the state of
spontaneous catalepsy (see Stomach, Seeing with). which
would seem to sho'~ that persons in this condition are
amenable to suggestion in a high degree. The true physical
re~oos for catalepsy arc still practically unknown toscience.
But there seem to be good reasons for believing that it can
be self-induced in certain cases. Many Eastern fakirs have
been known to castthemselvesintoacatalepticslecplasting
for months and cases havc even been known where they per-
mitted themselves to be buried. being exhumed when the
grass had grown over their graves. (See Dendy, Philosophy

Catoptromancy, or Enoptromancy is a spcctes of divination
by the mirror, which Pausanius describes : " Before the
Temple of Ceres at Patras. there was a fountain, separated
from the ter.tplc by a wall, and there was an oracle. very
truthful, not for all events, but for the sick only. The sick
person let down a mirror, suspended by a thread. till its
base touched the surface of the water, having first prayed
to the goddess and offered incense. Then looking in the
mirror. he saw the presage of death or recovery, according
as the face appeared fresh and healthy, or of a ghastly
aspect." Another method of using the mitror was to place
it at the back of a boy's or girl's head, whose eyes were
bandaged. In Thessaly, the response appe:ucd in char-
acters of blood on the face of the moon, probably repre·
sented in the mirror. The Thessalian sorcer&ses deri>-ed.
their art from the Persians, who atways endeavoured to
plant their religion and mystic rite~ in the countries they
invaded.
Cats, Elfin : These arc to be found in the Scottish High!an~.
and a~e S3id to be of a wild breed, as large as dogs. black
in co!our, with a white SJ?Ot on the breast, and to have
arched backs and erect bnstles. By some. these cats ar~
said to l:e ,,;tches in disguise.
Cauldron Devils : An abyss at the summit of the Peak of
Teneriffc. A stone cast into the gulf resounds as though.
a copper vessel were being struck by a huge hammer, and
on this account its name has been bestowed on it by the
Spaniards. The natives of the Island are persuaded that
the infernal regions are there, where dwell for ever the
-souls of the wicked.
Causimomaney : Divination by tire. It is a happy presage
when combustible objects cast into the fire do not burn.
Cazotte, J acques (t72o-r792): A French romance w-riter,
and the reputect author of the famous Prophetic de Cazotte,
concerning the Revolution. His sympathies were not with
the revolutionary party. Hi5 letters were seized, and he·
and his daughter Elizabeth thrown into prisou. During
the September massacres, Elizabeth saved his life by
flinging herself between him and the cut-throats who·
sought to kill him. He escaped, but was re-arreeted,
condemned, and beheaded. He was the author of the
cclcbr::.ted occult romance Le Diable A moureux.
Celestial Light : The S:\cred light of all the ages, which is
" as the lightnin~ which shineth from the west to the east."
It is the halo which surrounds certain visions of a my~tical
character, but can only be seen by those who have lived
ascetically, when respiration is feeble, and life has almost
left the body.
Cellini, Benvenuto : This celebrated Italian artist ana crafts·
man had several most interesting adventures w1th demons
and professors of the black art. In his Life be writes a~
follows.
" It happened, through a variety of odd accidents, that
I made acquainta:tce \\;th a Sicilian priest, who was a man
of genius. and well versed in the Latin and ~reek ~uth<?rr·
Happening one day to have some conversat:ton wtth htm,
when the subject turned on the subject of necromancy,
I, who had a gre"at desire to know something of the matter.
told him. that I had all my life felt a curiosity to be ac·
quainted with the mysteries of this art. The priest made
answer, • That the man must be of a resolute and steady
temper who enters upon that study.' I replied, • That
I had fortitude and resolution enough, if I could but find
an opportunity.' The priest .subjoined, • If you tl~ink ~ou
have the heart to venture, I will gtve you all the sabsfact•on
you can desire.' Thus we agreed to enter upon a plan of
necromancy. The priest one evening prepared to satisfy
me, and desired me to look out for a companion or two.
I invited one Vincenzio Romoli, who was my iutirnate
acquaintance : he brought with ~im a native of ~istoia,
who cultivated the black art htmself. We repatred to
the Colloseo, and the priest, according to the custom. of
necromancers, began to draw circles upon the ground wtth
the most impressive ceremonies imaginable : he likewise
brought hither assaf<eti_d~, several pr~ciou~ perfume~ and
fire with some composttlons also whtch dtffused notsome
od;urs. As soon as he was in readiness, he made an open·
ing to the circle, and having taken us by the hand, ordered
the other necromancer, his partner, to throw the perfumes
into the fire at the proper time, intrusting the care of the
fire and the perfumes to the rest ; and then he began his
incantations. This ceremony lasted above an hour and
Cellini 96 Celts
a half, when there ap.Pe...red several legions of devils inso-
much that the amphitheatre was quite filled with them.
I was busy about the perfumes, wh"n tl•e p11cst, perceiving
there was a considerable number of infernal spirits, turned
to me and said, ' Benvenuto, ask them something.' I
answered, 'Let them bring me into the company of my
Sicilian mistress, Angelica.' That night we obtained no
answer of any sort; but I had received great satisfaction
in having my curiosity so far indulged. The necromancer
told me, it was requisite we should go a second time, assur-
ing me, that I should be satisfied in whatever I asked ;
but that I must bring with me a pure immacu!ate boy.
" I took with me a youth who was in my service, of
about twelve years of age, together with the same Vin-
cenrio Romo!i, who had been my comp:1nion the first time
and one Agnolino Gaddi. an intimate acquaintance, whom
I likewise prevailed on to assist at the ceremony. \\'hen
we came to the pln.cc appointed, the priest having made
his preparations as before, with the same and eYen more
striking ceremonies, placed us within the circle, which he
had likewise drawn with a more wonderful art, and in a
more solemn manner, than at our former meeting. Thus
having committed the care of the perfume and the fire to
my friend Vincenzio, who was assisted by Agnolino Gaddi,
he put into my hand a pintacula or magical chart, and bid
me turn it towards the places that he should direct me;
and under the pintacu!a I held the boy. The necromancer
having begun to make his tremendou~ invocations, called
bv their names a multitude of demons, who were the leaders
of the several legions, and questioned them by the power
of the eternal uncreated God, who lives for ever, in the
Hebrew language, as like·.vise in Latin and Greek; inso-
much that the amphitheatre was almost in an instant
filled with demons more numerous than at the former
conjuration. Vincenzio Romoli was busied in making
a fire, with the assistance of Agnolino, and burning a great
quantity of precious perfumes. I. by the direction of the
necromancer, again desired to be in the company of my
Angelica. The former thereupon turning to me, said,
• Know, they have declared, that in the space of a month
vou shall be in her company.'
• " He then requested me to stand resolutely by him,
because the legions were now above a thousand more in
number than he had designed ; and, besides these were
the most dangerous ; so that, after they had answered
my question, it behoved him to be civil to them, and dis-
m1SS them quietly. At tlte same time the boy under the
pintacula was in a terrible fright, saying, that there were
in that place a million of fierce me!l, who threatened to
destroy us ; and that, moreover, four armed giants of
an enormous stature were endeavouring to break into our
circle. During this time, whilst the necromancer, trem-
blin~ with fear. endeavoured by mild and gentle methods
to dtsmiss them in the best way he could, Vincenzio Romoli,
who quivered like an aspen lelf, took care of the perfumes.
Though I was as much terrified as any of them, I did my
utmost to conceal the terror I felt; so that I greatly con-
tributed to inspire the rest with resolution ; but the truth
is, I gave myself over for a dead man, seeing the horrid
fright the necromancer was in. The boy placed his bead
between his knees, and said, ' In this posture I will die ;
for we shall all surely perish.' I told him that all these
demons were under us, and what be saw was smoke and
shadow; so I bid him hold up his head and take courage.
No sooner did he look up, but be cried out, ' The whole
amphitheatre is burning, and the fire is just falling upon
us;' so covering his eyes with his hands, he again exclaimed
that destruction was inevitable, and he desired to see no
more. Thenecromancerentreated me to have a good heart,
and take care to to bum the proper perfumes ; upon which
I turned to Romoli, and bid him burn all the most precious
perfumes he had. At the same time I cast my eye upon
Agnolino Gaddi, who was terrified to such a degree that
he could scarce distinguish objects, and seemed to be half-
dead. Seeing him in this condition, I said, • Agnolino,
upon these occasions a man should not yield to fear, but
should stir about and give his assistance ; so come directly
and put on some more of these perfumes.' Poor Agnolino,
upon a.ttemptin~ to move, was so violently terrified that
the effects of h1s fear overpowered all the perfumes we
were burning. The boy, hearing a crepitation, ventured
once more to raise his bead, when, seeing me laugh, he
began to take courage, and said, · That the devils were
flying away with a vengeance.'
" In this condition we stayed til! the bell rang for morn-
ing prayer. The boy again told us, that there remained
but few de"ils, and these were at a great distance, \Vhen
the magician had performed the rest of his ceremonies.
he stripped off his gown and took up a wallet full of books
which he had brought with him. \\'e all went out of the
circle together, k·~eping as close to each other as we possibly
cou!d, especially the boy, who had placed himself in the
middle, holding the necromancer by the coat, and me by
the c!oak. As we were going to our houses in the quarter
of Banchi, the boy told us that two of the demons whom
we had seen at the amphitheatre, went on before us leaping
and skipping, sometimes running upon the roofs of the
houses, and sometimes upon the ground. The priest de-
cbrcd, that though he had often entered magic circles,
nothing so extraordinary had ever happened to him. As
we went along, he would fain pers\\ade me to assist with
liin1 at consecrating a book, from which, be said, we should
derive immense riches : we should then ask the demons
to discover to us the various treasures with which the earth
abounds, which would raise us to opulence and power ;
but that those love-affairs were mere follies, from whence
no good could be expected. I answered, ' That I would
readily have accepted his proposal if I understood Latin : '
he redoubled his persuasions, assuring me, that the know-
ledge of the Latin language was by no means material.
He added, that he could have Latin scholars enough, if
he had thought it worth while to look out for them ; but
that he could never have met with a partner of resolution
and intrepidity equal to min~. and that I should by all
means follow his advice. Whilst we were engaged in this
conversation, we arrived at our respective homes, and
all that night drc;~.mt of nothing but devils.''
Celonitis or Celontes : This wonderful stone is found in the
tortoise, and its property is to resist fire. Its healing
virtues are two-fo!d, similar to those of the Asinius.
Carried under the tongue on the day of the new moon,
and for the fifteen days following, during the lunar ascen-
sion, it inspires its fortunate possessor to foretell future
events every day from sunrising to six o'clock; and in
the decrease during the intervening hours.
Celts : l\fagic among the Celtic peoples in ancient times was
so closely identified with Druidism that its origin may be
said to have been Drnidic. That Druidism was of Celtic
origin, however, is a question upon which much discussion
has been lavished, some authorities, among them Rhys,
believing it to have been of non-Celtic and even non-Aryan
origin. This is to say that the earliest non-Aryan or so-
called " Iberian " or Megalithic people of Britain intro-
duced the immigrant Celts to the Druidic religion. An
argument in favour of this theory is that the continental
Celts sent their neophyte Druid priests to Britain to undergo
a special training at the hands of the Druids there, and
there is little doubt that this island was regarded as the
headquarters of the cult. The people of Cisalpine Gaul,
for instance, had no Druidic priesthood. (See Rice Holmes'
Celts 97 Ceremonial Magic
Ca:sar's Conquest, pp. 532·536). C<esar has told us that
in Caul Druidic seminaries were very numerous , and that
in them severe study and discipline were entailed upon
the neophytes, the principal business of whom was to
commit to memory countless verses enshrining Druidic
knowledge and tradition. That this instruction was astro-
logical and magical we have tht> fullest proof, and it is with
these aspects of the Celtic religion alor.e that we have to
deal in this place.
The Druids were magi as t!ley were hierophants in the
same sense that the American-Indian medicine-rna~ is
both magus and priest. That is, they were medicine-men
on a higher-scale, and possessed a larger share of trans-
cendental knowledge than the shamans of more barbarous
races. Thus they may be said to be a link between the
shaman and the magus of meclireva! times. ::IIany oi their
practices were purely shamanistic, whilst others were
more closely connected with medireva! magical rite. But
they were not the only magicians among the ·Celts, for W::!
find that magic power is frequently the possession of wo-
men and the poetic craft. The art magic of Druidism
had many points of comparison with most magical systems,
and may be said to have approximated more to that black
magic which desires power for the S:lke of power alone,
than to any more transcendental type. Thus it included
the power to render oneself invisibl~. to change the bodily
shape. to produce an enchanted s!cep, to induce lun?.cy,
and the uttnance of spells and charms which caused death.
Power over the clements W<lS also claimed, ~s in the case
of Broichan, a Caledonian Druid who opposed Saint Co-
lumbia, as we read in Adamnan's Life of that •:Unt
as follows:
" Droichan, speaking one day to the holy man, says :
' Tell me, Columba, at what time dost thou propose to
sJ.il forth ? "On the third day,' says the Saint, • Cod
willing and life rcmainin~. we propose to begin our voya~e.'
'Thou wilt not be able to do so.' says Broichan in reply,
• for I can make the wind contrary for thee, and bring
dark clouds upon thee.' The Saint says: ' The omnipo-
tence of Cod rules over 01!1 things, in \Vhosc )<arne all ou:
movements, He Himself governing them, a~e directed.'
What more need be said ? On the same day as be had
purposed in his heart the Saint came to the long lake of the
river Xcss, a ~rcat crowd following. But the Druids then
began to rcjo:ce whe:1 they saw a gre:!.t darkness coming
over, and a contrary wind with a tempest. Xor should
it be wondered at that these things can be done by the art
of demons. Cod permitting it, so that even winds and
waters are roused to fury.
" For it was thus that legions of devils once met the
holy bishop Germanus in mid-ocean, what time he was
sailing from the Callican Gulf (the British Channel) to
Britain in the cause of man's salvation, and stirred up
dangerous storms and spread darkness over the sky and
obscured daylight. A!l which storms, however, were
stilled at the prayer of S~. Cermanus, and, quicker than
said, ceased, and the darkness was swept away.
" Our Columba, therefore, seeing the furious clements
stirred up against him, calls upon Christ t!te Lord, and
entering the boat while the sailors arc hc5itating, he with
all the more confidenc.;, orders the sail to be rigged aga:nst
the wind. Which being done, the who~c crowd looking
on meanwhile, the boat is borne along ag<".inst the contrary
winds with amazing vc!ocity. And after no gre.1t interval,
the adverse winds veer round to the advantage of the
voyage amid the astonishment of al!. And thus, through-
out that whole day, the blessed man's boat was driven
along by gentle favouring breezes, and reached the desired
haven. Let the reader, therefore, consider how great
and saintly was that venerable man thro-agh whom A!-
mighty Cod manifested His glorious Name by such miracu·
lous powers as have just been described in the presence
of a heathen people."
The art of rain-making, bringing down fire from the sky,
and causing mists, snow-storms and floods was also claimed
by the Druids. ~fany of the spells probably in usc among
the Druids survived until a comparatively late period,
and arc stil! in use in some remote Celtic localities-the
names or Saints being substituted for those of Celtic deities,
-as in Wc!l-wo:ship (q.v.) a possibly Druidic cultus, and
certai:l riba! practices which are sti!! carried out in the
vicinity of megalithic structures. In pronouncing incan-
tations, the usual method employed was to stand upon
one leg, to point to the person or object on which the spell
was to be laid with the fore-finger, at the same time closing
an eye, as if to concentrate the force of the entire person-
ality upo:1 that which was to be placed under ban. A
manuscript preserved in the Monastery of St. Call and
dating from the eighth or ninth centl.iry, has preserved
magical formulre for the preservation of butter and the
healing of certain diseases in the name of the Irish god
Diancecht. These and others bear a close resemblance
to Babylonian and Etruscan spells, and this goes to
strengthen the hypothesis often put forward with more
or !ess ability that Druidism had an eastern origin. All
magical rites wore accompanied by spells. Druids often
accompanied an army to assist by their magical art in
confounding the enemy.
There is little doubt that the conception of a Druidic
priesthood has descended down to our own time in a more
or less debased condition in British Celtic areas. Thus
the existence of guardians and keopers of wells said to
possess magical properties, and the fact that certain
famili~r magical spells and formula! are handed down from
one gen ra.tiCin to ano!her, is a proof of the survival of
Druidic tradition, however feeble. Females are generally
the conservators of these mysteries, but that there were
Druid priestesses is fairly certain.
Tber.· are at~o bd;cations that to some extent Scottish
witchcraft was a survival of Celtic rehgio-magical practice.
(See Wlteheraft, Scottish in article Scotland.)
Amulets were extensively worn by the Celts, the prin-
cipal forms in use being phallic (against the evil eye), coral,
the ·• serpent's egg "-some description of fossil. The
person who passed a number of serpents together for-ming
such an .. egg " from their collected spume had to catch
it in his c!oak ere it fell to earth, and then make a!! speed
over a running-stream where he was safe from the reptiles'
vengeance. Totemic amulets were also common. (See
Scotland and Ireland.)

likeness of the beholder.
Cerauniu;, or Cerraelus, is described as a pyramidal crystal-
line stono, tinged with saffron, and is said to fall from the

Ceremonial Magie : Ceremonial m:~.gic is chiefly occupied
Ceremonial Maglo 98 Chakras
with the art of dealing with spirits. Its rites are supposedly
religious, and the rituals which contain it partake largely
of the nature of religious observances. It is not, as gen·
erally supposed. a reversed Christianity or Judaism. nor
does it partake of the profanation of re!igious ritual. It
is in eftect an attempt to derive power from GOO for the
successful control of evil spirits. In the Grimoires and
Keys of Black Magic, the operator is constantly reminded
that he must meditate continually on the undertaking
in band, and centre every hope in the infinite goodness
of the Great Adonai. The god invoked in Black Magic
is not Satan as is so often supposed, but the Jehovah of
the Jews, and the Trinity of the Christians. 'Ihe founda-
tion of practical magic is almost certainly the belief in
the power of divine words to compel the obedience of all
spirits to those who could pronounce them. Such words
and names were supposed to invoke or dismiss the deni-
zens of the spirit world, a~d these with suitable prayers
were used in all magical ceremonies. Again it was thought
that it was easier to control evil spirits than to enlist the
sympathies of angels.
He who would gain such power over demons is exhorted
in the magical texts which exist to observe continence
and abstinence, to disrobe as seldom and sleep as little
as possible during the period of preparation, to meditate
continually on his undertaking and centre a!l his hopes
on the Great Adouai. The fast should be most austere,
and human society must be avoided as much as possible.
The concluding days of the fast should be additionally
strict-sustenance being reduced to bread and water.
Daily ablutions arc necessary, and these must be made
in water which has been previously exorcised according
to the ritual : especially must this be observed immediately
before the ceremony. Certain periods of the day and
night are ruled by certain planeh and these are to be
found in the book known as the Key of Solomon the King
(q.v). (See also Astrology.) The Book of Black i\lagic
taught that the hours of Saturn, Mars and Venus are
good for communion with spirits,-the hour of the first
named planet for invoking souls in Hell; and that of the
second those who have been slain in battle. In fact these
hours and seasons arc ruled by th: laws of astrology. In
the .Preparation of the instruments employed, the r.ere-
morues of purifying and consecrating, must be carefully
observed. An aspergillum composed of mint, marjoram,
and rosemary should be used for the first and should be
contained in a pot of glazed earth. For fumigation a
chafing dish should be used filled with freshly kindled
coal and perfumed with aloe-wood or mace, benzoin or
storax,
The experiment of holding converse with spirits should
be made in the day and hour of :\Jercury : that is the rst
or 8th, or the 15th or zznd (See Necromancy). The Grand
Grimoire says that when the night of action has arrived,
the operator shall take a rod, a goat-skin, a blood-stone,
two crowns of vervain, and two candlesticks with candles ;
also a new steel and two new dints, enough wood to make
a fire, bali a bottle of brandy, incense and camphor, and
four nails from the coffin of a dead child. Either one or
three persons must take part in the ceremony-on of whom
only n1ust address the spirit. The Kabbalistic circle is
formed with strips of kid's skin fastened to the ground
by the four nails. With the blood-stone a triangle is traced
within the circle, beginning at the eastern point. The
letters a e a j must be drawn in like manner, as also the
Name of the Saviour between two cross~s. The candles
and vervain crowns are then set in the left and right sides
of the triangle within the circle, and they with the brazier
are set alight-the fire being fed with brandy and camphor.
A prayer is then repeated. The operator must be careful
to have no alloyed metal about him except a gold or silver
coin wrapped in paper, which must be cast to the spirit
when he appears outside the circle. The spirit is then
conjured three times. Should the spirit fail to appear,
the two ends of the magic rod must be plunged into the
flames of the brazier. This ritual is kno·wn as the Rite
of Lucifuge, and is believed to invoke the demon Lucifuge
Rofocale.
For further information concerning the ceremonial of
magic, See Necromancy and the articles on the various
rituals of magic, such as Arbatel, Key of Solo mon, Grimo-
rlum Verum. etc. (See Magic.)
Ceroseopy : Divination by wax. The process was as follows.
Fine wax was melted 1n a brass vessel until it became a
liquid of uniform consistence. It was then poured slowly
into another ,·esse! filled with cold water, in such a way
that the wax congealed in tiny discs upon the surface of
the water. The . magician then interpreted the figures
thus presented as he saw fit.
Chagrin or Cagrino : An evil spirit believed in by the Con-
tinental Gypsic~. It has the form of a hedgehog, is yellow
in colour, and is a foot and a half in length and a span in
bread th. "I am certain," says Wlislocki, "that this
creat"re is none other than the equally demoniac being
called H arginn, still believed in by the inhabitants of North·
western India. Horses arc the special prey of the Chagrin,
who rides them into a state of exhaustion, as does the
Guecubu (q.v.) of Chili. The next day they appear sick
and weary, with tangled manes and bathed in sweat. When
this is observed they are tethered to a stake which has
been rubbed with garlic juice, then a red thread is laid on
the ground in the form of a cross, or el~c some of the hair
of the animal is mixed with s1lt, meal and the blood of a
bat and cooked to bread, with which the hoof of the horse
is smeared. The empty vessel which contained the mix-
ture is put in the trunk of a high tree while these words
are uttered :
" Tarry, pipkin, in this tree,
Till such tirne as full ye be."
Chain, Formin~ a : In spiritualism, a term denoting the
joining of the hands of the sitters round a table, whereby
the magnetic current is strengthened and reinforced. The
Baron de Gu!dcnstubbC gives the following directions for
forming a chain. •· ln order to form a chain, the twelve
persons each place their right hand on the table, and their
left hand on that of their neighbour, thus making a circle
round the table. Observe that the medium or mediums
if there be !'llOre than one, are entirely isolated from those
who form the chain."
D r. Lapponi, in his llypnolism and Spiritism (trans.
London, 1906), gives an account of the usual procedure
for the formation of a chain. " He (the medium) makes
those present choose a table, which they may examine as
much as they like, and may place in whatever part of the
room they choose. Ifc then invites some of the assistants
to place their hand:; on the tab!.: in the following mann('r :
l hc two thumbs of each person are to be touchi11g each
other, and each little finger is to be in communication with
the litt'lc fmger of the persons on either side. He himself
comp~etcs the clzai11 with h;s two hands. The har\dS of
aU altogether rest on the edge of the table. (See Planetary
Chains.)

Chakras : These. are, according to theosophists, the sen~e
organs of the ethcra! body (q.v.) and receive their name
from their appearance which resembles vortices. Alto-
gether there are ten chakras-visible only to clairvoyants-
but of these it is advisable to usc only seven. They are
situated, not on the denser physical body, but opposite
certain parts of it as follows : (r) the top of the head, (2}
Chalcedony 99 Charnock
between the eyebrows, (3) the throat, (4) the heart (5) the
spleen-(where vitality is indrawn from the sun).' (6) the
solar plexus, (7) the base of the spine. The remaining
three cl!akras are situated in the lower part of the pelvis
and norma!!y arc not used, but are brought into plav only
in Black :llagic. It is by means of the cha.~ras that the
trained occultist can i>ecome acquainted with the astral
world. (Sec Theosophy.)
Ch~lcedony : A sood specific against phantasy and the illu-
sions of evil spirits. It also quickens the power of the
body, and renders its possessor fortunate in law. '!'o the
htter effect it must be perforated and suspended by hairs

and clears the voice.
Chams: A r:1cc of Indo-Chinese origin, numbering about
IJO,OOo souls, settled in Annam, Siam, Cochin-China, and
Cambodia. They have some reputation among the sur-
rounding population as sorcerers, this corruption probably
arising from the mythic influence of a conquered race.
Their magicians claim to be able to slay at a distance, or
to bring ruin and disease IJy the aid of magical formuloe.
Among the Cambodian Chams, sorcerers are cordially d<:-
tested by the common people, as they arc believed to be
the source of all tho evil which befalls them, and the ma-
jority of them usually end their days by secret assassina-
t ion. They are nearly always of the female sex, and enter
the sisterhood l>y rnc:~ns of a secret initiation held in the
depths of the forest at the hour of midnight. Indeed the
actual method of initiation is known to us. The woman
who de~ires to become a sorceress procures the nest of a
termite, and sacrifices thereon a cock (See Cock), cutting
it in two from the head to the tail, and dancing in front
of it in a condition of complete nudity, until by force of
her incantations the two halves of the bird approach one
another and it becomes once more alive and gives vent
to a crow. Sorceresses are said to be known by the ten-
dency of th<'ir complexion to alter its hue, and by their
swollen and bloodshot eyes. They possess numerous rite-;
f<>r the propitiation of evil spirits, in which, in common
with the neighbouring and surrounding populations, tbey
implicitly believe. Thus in building a house numerous
propitiatory rites must be observed, accompanied by in-
vocation of the protecting deities. They believe in lucky
and unlucky day$, and are careful not to undertake any-
thing of importance unless favoured by propitious omens.
They possess many peculiar superstitions. Thus they
wi!l not disturb grain which has been l;tored during the
clay time, as they say it is then asleep, and wait until night-
fall before supplying themselves from it. They also have
many magical agricultural formul<e, st1ch as the " instruc-
tion" to, and ·· passing " of, the standing rice-stems in
the harvest field before they are cut and garnered, so that
they may be worthy to Ut! stored. The Brahmanic Chams
believe that the souls of good men betake themselves to
the sun, those of women to lhe moon, and those of the
coolie class into clouds, but these are only places of tem-
porary sojourn, until such time as all finally come...to reside
within the centre of the earth. The belief in metempsy-
chosis is also highly popular. See E. Aymonier, Les
Tchames et leur Religio;1s, Paris, 189I; Aymonier Chaton,

Changelings : The substitution of a little old mannikin of
the elf race, for a young child. There are many tales repre-
sentative of this belief in Scotland. The changelit~g grows
up peevish and misshapen, always crying, and gives many
proofs of its origin to those versed in such matters. There
are many ways of getting rid of hun, such as sticking a
knife into him, making him sit on a gridiron with a fire
below, droppihg him into a river, etc.,-which one would
imagine would prove fairly successful The changeling
sometimes gives himself away by unthinking reference
to his age.

Cbarlemagn3; or Charles the Great : The greatest of Frank-
ish kings ; was the elder son of Pe,Pin the Short, and suc-
ceeded his father in 768 A.D. He IS included in this work
chiefly bec3usc of his close connection with the supernatural
eo far as legend is concerned. Again and again in the pages
of French romance, notably in these romances dealing
with the adventures or \ri!!iam of Orange, do we find the
Emperor visited by ange!s who are the direct messengers
of the heavenly power. This of course is to symboli:e
his position as the head and front of Christendom in the
world. He was its champion and upholder, surrounded as he
was on all sides by the forces o£ paganism,-the Moors on
his southern borders, and the Prussian! and Saxons on
his flank. Charles was regarded by the Christians
of Europe as the direct representative of heaven, whose
mission it was to Chrislianisc Europe and to defend the
true faith in every way. No less do we find him and his
court connected with the rca!m of filery. Notices of the
encounters of the fairy folk by his paladins are not so nu-
merous in the original French romances which deal with
him and them; but in the hands of Boiardo, Ariosto, and
Pulci, they dwelt in an enchanted region where at any
moment they might meet with 2.11 kinds of supernatural
beings. But both in the older and later romances the
powers of magic <!.nd enchantment arc ever present. These
are chiefly instanced in magical weapons such as the Sword
Durandal of Roland which cannot be shivered ; the mag-
ical ointments of giant~ like Ferragus, which rubbed on
their bodies make them invulnerable ; the wearing of
armour which exercises a similar guardianship on the body
of its possessor, and so forth. Bul :ove find ~eroes like
Ogier, the Dane, penetrating into f;ury land 1tself, and
wedding its queen.. Thi~ was the_ fale of a great many
medioeval heroes. and Og•er finds ul the enchanted realm
King Arthur. and several other paladins. The analogous
cases of Tom-.:.-Lincolnc, Ta.Slnhauser and Thomas the
Rhymer, will readily occur to the reader. The magical
and the marvellous is everywhere in use i~ the. romances
which dtal with Cllarlem(lglle. Indeed lll this respect
they entirely put in lhe shade the later romances proper,
as distinguished from the Chansons de Geste.

Charnock, Thomas : Alchemist. (1524 ? - ~581) .. Com-
paratively l.ittl? biographi~cl matte~ c~mcernmg th1s Eng-
lish alchem1st 1s forthcommg, but tt ts recorded that ~e
was born somewhere in the Isle of Thanet, Kent ; wh1le
as to the date, this is revealed inasmuch a~ one of hil> manu-
scripts, dated 1574, is st.:.ted by the ~nter to have been
penned in ·· the fifty yeare of my age. As a }:'O'!ng man
lte travelled all over England in search of alchem•st1c know-
ledge, but eventually he f1xetl his residence at Oxford, ~nd
here he chanced to make the acquaintance of a noted sc•en-
tist. The latter, greatly i_mpress~d \v?-th tlle youth's
cleverness, straightway appomted him. hi~ con~dant a_nd
assistant in gc:teral; and, after working 10 th1s capac1ty
for a number of years, Clrar11och found hi~sel~ the sole
legatee of his patr?n's p~rap~1ernalia, and likew1se of the
various secrets wntten m hlS note-books. Armed thus,
he proceeded to devote himself more eagerly than ever to
Charnock 100
the quest of gold-production; but _in 1555. just as he im-
agined himself on the verJ);e of tnumph, h1s hopes were
frustrated by a st:ddcn explosion in !tis laboratory ; while
in 1557. when he again thought that success was imminent,
the press·g~ng arri.n-'<1 at his ho~se and lai? violent hands
on him bem~ am(lour. for recruits wherewith to swl"ll the
English army the~ fi~ht:n~ ~he F_rench. T~e al~h01uist
was bitterly chagnned on be1ng k1dnappcd m th's ""Ise,
and, lest his secrets should be disco'"ered by prying eye~.
he set himself to destroy ;d) Us precious impedime;,ta.
" With :ny workc m;-.<lt• such a furiot:s faire
That the !;Old flew forth in the aire,"-
so he writes concernin~ this iconoclasm. and, subsequent
to this event, he proceeded to France as a soldier, 0\nd
took part in the disastrous campaign which cu!minatcd
in the En,lish being worsted at Calais by the Due de Guise.
How Cha~nock fared durin~ the expedition is not known,
and it is likely that he found smal! pleasure in the rough
life; but be that as it may, he returned to England safely,
and in 1562 he was married to one Agnes Norton. There-
after he settled at Stockland, in the county of Somerset,
and here he continued to pursue scientific researches, ap-
parently unmolested by further visitations from the military
powers. Nor would it seum that the clergy molested him
either, or looked askance on his alchemistic studiP.s ; for
on his death, which occurred in 1581, his mort~! remains
were duly interred at Ottcrhampton Church, Bridgwater.
That facetious antiquary and historian, Anthony Wood,
in his Athem:u Oxoniensis, cn;dits Charnock with a consid-
erable amount of writin~. and it is possible that several
items enumerated are in ru;\lity from some other pen than
the alchemist's. However, there arc certain books which
the latter undoubtedly wrote, notably ..t;nigma ad Alchi-
miam, issued in J 572 ; while no less interesting than this
is the Breviary of Salural Philosophy, which is couched
in verse, was published origin.:.l!y in 1557, and was ~ubse­
quently reprinted in the Tl:eatrum Chemic:w1 of Elias

China : Although it can harcUy be said that any system of
magic worthy of the name ever originated in China. and
thou!lh magical practice was uncommon, yet instances
are not wanting of the employment of magical means in
the Celestial Empire, and the belief in a supernatural world
China
peopled by gods, demons and other beings is very strong
in the popular Chinese mind.
•· Although the Chinese mind possessed under such a
constitution but few e:ements in which magic could strike
root and throw out its ramifications and influence, yet
we find many traces giving evidence of the instinctive
move:nent of the mind, as well as of magical influence;
though ccrt.1.inly not i'l the manner or abundance that we
meet with it in India. The great variety of these appear-
ances is, howovcr, strikmg, :t~ in no other country arc they
so seldom met with.
" As the I<ing, as it we!e, microcosmicallr represents
the human races in fortune or misfortune before the divinity
so must his eve be con~tantly directed to those signs in
which the will of the ;\lost High is revealed ; · He must
observe dreams as much as the phenomena of nature. the
eclipses and the po itions of the stars ; and, when all else
is wanting, he must con~ult the oraclo of the tortoise, or
the Pla:lt Tsche, and direct his actioQ..S accordingly.' He
is therefore, as it were, the univ~rsal oracle of the people,
as the popul:u- mind is relieved from every flight of imag-
ination by a highly remarkable mental compulsion." ...
" lt is easy to understand from these circumstances
wherefore we find so few of these phenomena of magic and
the visionary and ecstatic state, in other parts of the East
so frequent, and therefore they arc scattered and uncertain.
Accounts are, however, not wanting to show that the
phenomena as we!l as theories of prophecy were known
in more remote times. Under the Emperor Hoei Ti, about
A.D. 304, a mystical sect arose in China calling themselves
the teachers of th·· emptiness and nothingness of all things.
They also exhibited the art of binding the power of the
senses, and producing a condition which they believed
perfection."
Demo11ism and Obsrssio11. The Chinese are implicit
believers in demons whom they imagine surround them
on every hand. Says Peebles· " English officials, Ameri-
can missionaries, mandarins and many of the Chinese
literati (Confucians, Taoist3 and Buddhist believers alike)
declare that spritism in some form, and under some name,
is the almost unive~·sal belief of Chi11a. It is generally
denominated • ancestral worship.' "
"There is no driving out of there Chinese," !ays Father
Gonzalo, ·· the cursed belief that the spirits of their an-
cestors are ever about them, availing themselves of every
opportunity to give advice and counsel."
.. The medium consulted," remarks Dr. Doolittle," takes
in the hand a stick of lighted incense to dispel aJ. defiling
influences, tht>n prayers of some kind are repeated, the
bony becomes spasmodic, the medium's eyes arc shut,
and lhe form sways about, assuming the walk and peculiar
attitude of the spirit when in the body. Then the com-
munication from the divinity begins, which may be of a
faultfinding or a flattering character. . . . Sometimes
these Chinese mediums profess to be possessed by some
specified historical god of great healing power. and in
this condition they prescribe for the sick. lt is beli..:vcd
that the ghoul or spirit invoked actually cast~ himself into
the medium, and dictates the medicine."
•• Volumes might be wrillen upon the gods, genii and
familiar ~pirits supposed to be continually in communi-
cation with thi~ people," writes Dr. John L. Nevius, in
his works, China and The Chi11ese. •· The Chinese have
a large number of books upon this subject, among the most.
noted of which is the Liau-chai-ohci ' a large work of
sixteen volumes. . . . Tu Sein signifies a spirit in the
body, and there are a class of familiar spirits supposed to
dwell in the bodies of certain Chinese who became thtl
mediums of communication with the unseen world. In-
dividuals said to be possessed by these spirits are visited
China· 101 China
by ~ultitudes, particu!arl.Y those who have lost recently
relatives by death, and w1sh to converse \\ith them....
Remarkable disclosures and revelations are believed to
be made by the .in~oluntary movements of a bamboo pencil;
and through a s1mllar method some claim to see in the dark.
Persons considering themselves endowed with sup!rior
intelligence are firm believers in those and other modes
of consulting spirits."
The pub!~c t~achcr in Che~ Sin Ling (W. J. Plumb says):
" In the d1stnct of Tu-ching, obsessions by evil spirits
or demons are very common." He further writes that
" there are very many cases also in Chang-!o." Again he
says:
" W~en a m~n is thus. afflicted, the spirit (Kwei) takes
posseSSIO~ of h1s body ,~1thout regard to his being strong
or weak m health. It IS not easy to resist the demon's
power. Though, without bodily ailments, pns~essed per-
sons appear as 1f ill. When under the entrancing spell
of the demon, they seem different from their ordinary
selves.
" In most cases the spirit takes possession of a mal\'s
body contrary to his will, and he is helpless in the matter.
The kwei has the power of driving out the man's spirit, as in
sleep or drcaiTIS. When the subject awakes to conscious·
ness, he has not the slightest knowledge of what has tran-
spired.
- " The actions of possessed persons vary exceedingly.
They leap about and toss their arms, and then the demon
tells them what particular spirit he is, often taJ..ing a false
naUJe, or deceitfully calling himself a god, or one of the
genii come down to the abodes of mortals. Or, perha.J:s.
it professes to be the spirit of a deceased husband or w1fe.
There are also kwoi of the quiet sort, who tallc and laugh
like other people, only that the voice is changed. Some
have a voice like a bird. Some speak Mandarin-the
language of Northern Chi11a-and some the local dialect ;
but though the speech proceeds from the mouth of the
man, whnt i~ said does not appear to come from him. The
outward appearance and manner is also changed.
.. In Fu-show there is a class of persons who collect in
large numbers and make usc of incl!nse, pictures, candles
and lamps to establish what are called · incense tables.'
Taoist prie~ts are engaged to attend the ceremonies. and
they a!so make use of ' mediums.' The Taoist writes a
;:harm for the medium, who, taking the inccusc etick in
his hand, stands like a graven image, thu~ signifying b;s
willingness to have the demon come and take possession
of him. Afterward, the r.harm is burned and the demon·
spirit is worshipped and invoked, the priest, in the m~;an·
while going on with his chanting. After a while the medium
begins to tremble, and then speaks and announces what
spirit has descended, and asks what is wanted of him.
Then, whoever ho:.s requests to make, takes incense sticks,
makes prostrations, and asks a response respecting some
disease, or for protection from some calamity. In winter
the same performances arc carried on to a gre~ t extent
by gambling companies. If some of the rcspon~·'S Jut
the mark, a large number of people arc attracted. They
establish a shrine and offer sacrifices, and appoint days,
calling upon people from every quarter to come and consult
the spirit respecting diseases. . . .
''There is also a class of men who establish what thev
call a 'Hall of Revelations.' At the ptesent time there
are many engaged in this practice. They are, for the most
part, literary men of great ability. The people in large
numbers apply to them for responses. The mediuiTIS
spoken of above are also numerous. All of the above
practices are not spirits seeking to possess men ; but rather
men seeking spirits to possess them, and allowing them·
selves to b<.> voluntarily uJed as their instruments.
" As to tho outward appearance of persons when pos·
sessed, of cnurse, they are'the same person~ as to outward
form as at ordinary times ; but the colour of the counte·
nancc may change. The demon may caus~ the subject
to assume a threatening air, and a fierce, violent manner,
The muscles often stand out on the face, the eyes are closed,
or they protrude with a frightful stare. These demons
sometimes prophesy.
"The \\Ords spoken cert&inly proceed from the mouths
of the persons possessed ; but what is said dorn; not appear
to come from their minds or wi!ls, but rather from some
other personality, often accompanied by a change of voice.
Of this there can be no douht. When the subject roturns
to consciousness, he invariably declares himseli ignorant
of what he bas said.
" The Chinese make usc of various methods to cast out
demons. They are so troub~cd and vexed by inflictions
afiecting bodily health, or it may l>e throwing stones,
movinf! furniture, or the moving about and destruction
of famtly utensils, that they are driven to call in the service
of some respected scholar or Taoist priest, to offer sacrifices.
or chant sacred books, and pray for protection and ex-
emption from suffering. Some make ~se of sacrifi~s and
offerings of paper c!othcs and money 1n order to 1nduce
the demon to go back to the gloomy region ofYan-chow.
As to whether these methods have any effect, I do not
know. As a rule, when demons aru r.ot very troublesome,
the families afflicted by them generally think it best to
hide their affliction, or to keep these wicked spirit6 quiet
b}' sacrifices, and burning incense to them."
An article in the Lo11d1m Daily News gives lengthy ex-
tracts from an address upon the Chinese by Mrs. Montague
Beaucham, who had spent many years in China in edu-
cational work. Speaking of their sp:ritism, she said, "The
latest Loodon craze in using the planchette has been one
of the recognized means in China of conve~ing .with evil
spirits from time immemorial.'' She had hved m one of
the particular provinces known as demon land, where the
natives are bound up in the belief and worship of spirits.
" There is a real power," sho added, •· in this necromancy.
They do healings and tell fortunes." She personally knew
of one instance that the spirits through the planchette had
foretold a great flood. The boxer rising was prophesied
by the planchette. These spirits disturbed family rela·
tions, caused fits of frothing at the mouth, and made some
of their victims insane. In closing she declared that
" Chinese spiritism was from hell," the obsession baftling
the power of both Christian .missionaries an<~: na~ive priests.
Dr. Nevius sent out a Circular commumcabon for: the
purpose or disco':'ering the actual. be!lefs of t~e Chmese
regarding clemorusm through wh1ch he obtamed much
valuable information. Wang \Vu-Fang, an educated
Chinese wrote :
•· Ca5es of demon possession abound among all classes.
They are found among persons of robust health, as well
as those who are weak and sickly. ln many unquestion-
able cases of obsession, the unwilling subjects Itave resisted,
but have been obliged to subm1t themselves to the control
of the demon....
" In the majority of cas~ of possession, th~ beginning
of the malady is a fit of gnef, anger or mournmg. Th~se
conditions seem to open the door to the demons.. ihe
outward manifestations arc apt to be fierce and v1olent.
It may be that the subject alternately talks and laughs;
be wa!ks awhile and then sits, or he rolls on the ground,
or leaps about ; or exhibits contortions of the body and
twistin"s of the neck. . . . It was common among them
to send for exorcists, who made use of written charms,
or chanted verse:!, or punctureu the body with ne~dles
These are among the Chinese r:te~hods of cur<.>.
Ohloa 102 China
" Demons are of different kinds. There are those which
clearly declare themselves; and then those who work in
secret. There are those which are cast out with difficulty,
and others with ease.
" In cases of possesion by familiar demons, what is said
by the subject certainly does not proceed from his own
will. When the demon has gone out and the subject re-
covers consciousness, he has no recollection whatever of
what he has said or done. This is true almost invariably.
" The methods by which the Chinese cast out demons
are enticing them to leave by burning charms and paper
money, or by begging and exhorting them, or by frightening
them with magic spells and incantations, or driving them
away by prickinf:with needles, or}iuchingwith the fingers,
in which case they cry out and promise to go.
" I was formerly accustomed to drive out demons by
means of needles. At that time cases of possession by
evil spirits were very common in our villages, and my
services were in very frequent demand.... "
The Rev. Timothy Richard, missionary, also writing
in response to Dr. Nevius' circular, says :
" The Chinese orthodo'> definition of spirit is, ' the soul
of the departed ;' some of the best of whom are raised to
the Tank of gods. . . There is no disease to which the
Chinese are ordinarily subject that may not b~ caused by
demons. In this case the mind is untouched. It is only
the body that suffetS; and the Chinese endeavour to ~et
rid of the demon by vows and offerings to the gods. The
subject in this case is an involuntary one....
"Persons possessed ran:;e between fifteen and fifty years
of age, quite irrespective of sex. This infliction comes
on very suddenly, sometimes in the day, and sometimes
in the night. The demoniac talks madly, smashes every-
thing near him, acquires unusual strength, tears his clothes
into rags, and rushes into the street, or to the mountains
or kills himself unless prevented. After this violent pos-
se5inn, the demoniac calms down and submits to his fate,
but under the most heart-rending protests. These mad
spells which are experienced on the demon's entrance
return at intervals, and increase in frequency, and gen-
erally also in intensity, so that death at last ensues from
their violence.
" A CheCoo boy of fifteen was going on an errand. His
path led through fields where men were working at their
crops. When he came up to the men and had exchanged
a word or two with them, he suddenly be~an to rave wildly;
his eyes rolled, then he made for a pona near by. Seeing
this, the people ran up to him, stopped him from drowning
himself and took him home to his parents. When he got
home, he sprang up from the ground to such a height as
manifested almost a superhuman strength. After a few
days he calmed down and became unusually quiet and
gentle; but his own con~ciousncss was lost. The- demon
spoke of its friends in Nan-Kin. After six months this
demon departed. He has been in the service of se-veral
foreigners in Chefoo since. In this case no worship wae
offered to the demon.
"Now we proceed to those, who involuntarily possessed,
yield to and worship the demon. The demon says he will
ccaso tormenting the demoniac if he will worship him,
and he will reward him by increasing hi~ riches. But if
not, he will punish his victim, make heavier bis torments
and rob him of his property. People find that their food
is cursed. They cannot prepare any, but filth and dirt
comes down from the air to render it uneatable. Their
wells are likewise cursed; their wardrobes are set on fire,
and their money very mystcriou~ly disappears. Hence
arose the custom of cutting off the head of a string of cash
that it might not run away. . . . When all efforts to
rid themselves of tho demon fail, they yield to it, and say
' Hold ! Cease thy tormenting and we will worship thee I •
A picture is pasted upon the wall, sometimes of a woman,
and sometimes of a man, and incense is burned, and pros-
trations are made to it twice a month. Being thus rev-
erenced, money now comes in mysteriously, m~tead of
going out. Even mill-stones are made to move at the
demon's orders, and the family becomes rich at once. But
it is said that no luck attends such families, and they will
eventually be reduced to poverty. Officials believe these
things. Palaces arc known to have been built by them
for these demon!, who, however, are obliged to be satis-
fied with humbler shrines from the poor....
" Somewhat similar to the above class i~ another small
one which has power to enter the lower regions. The3e
are the opposite of necromancers, for instead of calling
up the dead and learning of them about th:! future destiny
of the individual in whose behalf they are engaged, they
lie in a trance for two days, when their spirits are said to
have gone to the Prince of Darkness, to inquire how long
the sic'k person shall be left among the living....
" Let us now note the different m~thods adopted to
cast out the evil .~pirits from the demoniac;. Doctors
are called to do it. They use needles to puncture the tips
of the fingers, the nose, the neck. They also use a certain
pill, and apply it in the following manner: the thumbs
of the two hands arc tied tightly together, and the two
big t!>es are tied together in the same manner. Then one
pill is put on the two bi~ toes at the root of the nail, and
the other at the root 01 the thumb nails. At the same
instant the two pills arc set on fire, and they are kept until
the flesh is burned. In the application of the pills, or in
the piercing of the necxlle, the invariable cry is : ' I am
going; I am going immediately. I will never dare to
come back again. Oh, have mercy on me this once. I'll
never return ! '
" When tht> doctors fail, they call on people who practise
spiritism. They themseh·es cannot drive the demon away,
but they call another demon to do it. Both the Confu-
cianists and Taoists prartise this method. . . . Some-
times the spirits arc vl'ry ungovernable. Tables are
turncxl, chairs arc rattled, and a general noise of smashing
is heard, until the very mediums themselves tremble with
fear. If the demon is of this dreadful character, they
quickly write another charm with the name of the par-
ticular spirit whose quiet disposition is known to them.
Lu-tsu is a favourite one of this kind. After the burning
of the charm and incense, and when prostrations are made,
a uttle frame is procured, to which a Chines~ pencil is at-
tached. Two men on each side hold it on a tab)( spread
with sand or millet. Sometimes a prescription is writt~n.
the pencil moving of its own accord They buy the medi-
cine prescribed and give it to the possessed. Should
they find that burning incense and offering sacrifices fails
to liberate the poor victim, they may call in conjurors,
such as the Taoists, who sit on mats and arc carried by
invisible power from place to place. They ascend to a
height of twenty or fifty feet, and arc carri€d to a distance
of four or five li (about half a mile). 01 this class·are those
who, in ~lancburia call down fire from the sky in those
funerals where the corpse is burned....
' 1 These exorcists may belong to any of the three re-
ligions in China. The dragon procession, on the fifteenth
of the first month, is said by some to commemorate a
Buddhist priest's victory over evil spirits. . . . They
paste up charms on windows and doors, and on the body
of the demoniac, and conjure the demon never to return.
The evil spirit answers: • I'll n~ver return You need
not take the trouble of pasting all these charms upon the
doors and windows.'
" Exorcists arc specially hated by the evil spirits. Some-
'China 103 China
times they feel themselves beaten feadully ; but no hand
is seen. Brick.'> and stones may fall on them from the sky
or housetops. On the road they may without any warnmg
be plac;tered over from head to foot with mud or filth ;
or may be seized when approaching a river, and held under
the water and drowned."
In his Social Lift among the Chinest, Dr. Doolittle says :
"They have invented several ways by which they find
out the pleasure of gods and spirits. One of the most
common of their utensils is the Ka-put, a piece of bamboo
root, bean-shaped, and divided in the centre, to mdicate
the positive and the negative. The incense lighted, tbe
Ka-pue properly manipulated before the symbol god, the
pieces are tossed from the medium's hand, indicating the
will of the spirit by the way they fall."
The following manifestation is mental rather than physical:
" The professional takes in the hand a stick oflighted incense
to expel all defiling influences; prayers of some sort are
repeated, the fingers interlaced, and the medium's eyes
are shut, giving unmistakable evidence of being possessed
by some supernatural or spiritual power. The body sways
back and forward ; the incense falls, and the person begins
to step about, assunting the walk and peculiar attitude
of the spirit. This is con~idered as infallible proof that
the divinity has entered the body of the medium. Some-
times the god, using the mouth of the medium, gives the
supplicant a sound scolding for invoking his aid to obtain
unlawful or unworthy ends.
" Divi11ation," writes Sir John Burrows, "with many
strange methods of summoning the dead to instruct the
living and reveal the future, is of very ancient origin, as is
proved by Chinese manuscripts antedating the revelations
of the Jewish Scriptures."
An ancient Chinese book called Poh-slli-ching-tsung,
consisting of six volumes on the ·• Source of True Divina-
tion,'' contains the following preface :
"The secret of augury consists in the study of the mys-
teries and in communications with gods and demons. The
interpretations of the transformatioru; arc deep and mys-
t<..rious. The theory of the science ~ most intricate, the
practice of it most important. The sacred classic says :
• That which is true gives indications of the future.' To
know the condition of the dead, aud hold with them in-
telligent intercourse, as did the ancients, produces a mo~t
salutary influence upon the parties. . . . But when from
intoxication or feasting, or licentious pleasures, they pro-
ceed to invoke the gods, what infatuation to suppose that
their prayers wi!l move them Often when no response
is given, or the interpretation is not verified, they lay the
blame at the door of the augur, forgetting that their failure
is due to their want of sincerity. . . . It is the great fault
of augurs, too, that, from a desire of gain, they use the art
of divination as a trap to ensnare the people."
Pceb!l!s adds; " Naturally undemonstrative and secre-
tive, the higher classes of Chinese seck to conceal their full
knowledge of spirit intercourse from foreigners, and from
the inferior castes of their own countrymen, thinking them
not sufficiently intelligent to rightly us~ it. The lower
orders, superstitious and money-grasping, often prostitute
their magic gifts to gain and fortune-telling. These clair-
voyant fortune-tellers, surpassing wandering gypsies in
' bitting ' the past, infest the temples, streets and road-
sides, promising to find lost property, discover precious
metals and reveal the hidden future."
Ghosts.-The Chinese arc strong in the belief that they
are surrounded by the spirits of the dead. Indeed an-
cestor-worship constitutes a powerful feature in the
national faith, but as it deals with religion it doe> not come
within the scope of this article. Suffice it to say that the
Celestial has ever before him the likelihood and desirability
o! communion with the dead. On the death of a person
they make a hole in the roof to permit the soul to effect
its escape from the house. When a child is at the point
of death, its mother will go into the garden and call its
name, hoping thereby to bring back its wandering spirit.
"With the Chinese the souls of suicides arc specially
obnoxious, and they consider that the very worst penalty
that can befall a soul is the sight of its former surroundings.
This, it is supposed that, in the case of the wicked man.
' they only see their homes as if they were near them ;
they see their last wishes disregarded, everything upside
down, their substance squandered, strangers possess the
old estate; in their misery the dead man's family cur..e
him. his children become corrupt, land is gone, the wife
~ees her husband tortured, the husband sees his wife
stricken down with mortal disease ; even friends forget,
but some, perhaps, for the sake of bygone times, may stroke
the:. coffin and Jet fall a tear, departing with a cold smile.'"
"In Chit~a, the ghosts which are .animated by a sense
of duty arc frequently seen: at one bme they seek to serve
virtue in distress, and at another they aim to restore wrong-
fully held treasure. Indeed, as it has been observed, ' one
of the most powerful as well as the most widely diffused of
the people's ghost stories is that which treats of the perse-
cuted child whose mother comes out o! the grave to succour
him.'''
" The Chinese have a dread of the wandering spirits of
persons who have come to an unfortunate end. At Canton,
1817, the wife of an officer of Government had occ~ioned
the death of two female domestic slaves, !rom some Jealous
suspicion it was suppo~ed of her husband's conduct to-
wards the girls ; and, in order to screen herscl! from the
consequences, she suspended the bodies by the. n.cck, with
a view to its being construed into an act of smctde. But
the conscience of the woman tormented her to such a degree
that she became insane, and at times personated the .v~c­
tirns of her cruelty, or, as the ChineSe supposed, th:c spmts
of the murdered girls possessed her, and utilised her mouth
to declare her own guilt. In her ravings she tore her clothes
and beat her own person with all the fury of .madness;
after which she would recover her senses for a time, when
it was supposed the demons quitted her, but o~ly to rc~urn
with greater frenzy, which took place a short time prev10us
to hPr death. According to Mr. Dennys, the most common
form of Chinese ghost story is that wherein the gJ;IOSt seeks
to bring to justice the murderer who shuffled ofltts mortal
coil.''
Poltergeists (q.v.) arc not uncommon in Chit~a, and sever~
cases of their occurrence have been recorded by the Jesutt
mi~sionaries of the eighteenth century in Cochin C~na. !"fr
Denuys in hi. Folli l.oJ·~ of China, mentions a ca~e m whtch
a Chinaman was forced to take refuge in a temple by the
usual phenomena-throwing about o:f crockery, &c., after
the decease of a monkey. . . .

It has sometimes been claimed that the systems of Con-
fucius and Lao-Tzc arc magical or kabalist!c, but such
claims have been advanced by persons who d1d not appre-
ciate their proper status as philosophic systems. (See

Symbolism. There a re numerous mystenes ?f meamng
in the strangesymbols, characters, personages, bnd~. beasts,
etc. which adorn all species of Chinese art object.-;. For
example a rectangular Chinese vase is feminine, represc~ting
the creative or ultimate principle. A group of seeiillngly
miscellaneous art objects. depicted perhaps upon a brush
tray, are probably the po.-ku, ~r • hundr~d antiques,,' em-
blematic of culture and tmplymg a delicate comphment
to the recipient o:f the tray. Birds and animals occur with

frequency on Chinese porcelains, and, if one will observe
closely, it is a somewhat select menagerie, in which certain
types are emphasised by repetition. For instance, the
dragon is so familiar as ro be no longer remarked, and yet
his significance is perhaps not fully understood by aU.
There are, in fact. three kinds of dragons, the lrmg of the
skv, the li of the sea, and the kia11 of the marshes. The
l11ng is the favourite kind, however, and may be known when
met by his having • the head of a camel, the hornlt of a deer,
the eyes of a rabbit, ears of a cow, neck of a snake, belly
of a frog, scales of a carp, claw~ of a hawk, and palm of a
tiger.' His special office is to guard and support the man-
sions of the gods, and he is naturally the peculiar symbol
of the Emperor, or Son o£ Heaven.
A less familiar beast i!t the chi-li11, which resembles in
part a rhinoceros, but has head, feet, and legs like a deer,
and a tufted tail. In spite of his unprepossessing appear-
ance he is of a benevoh:nt disposition, and his image on
a v~c or other ornament is an emblem of good government
and length of days. A strange bird, having the head of a
pheasant, a long flexible neck and a plumed tail. may often
be seen flying in the midst of scroll-like clouds, or walking
in a grove of treepeonies. This is the jengbua11g, the
Chinese phoonix, emblem of immortality and appearing to
mortals only as a presage of the auspicious reign of a vir-
tuous Emperor. The tortoise (kuei), which bears upon
its back the seagirt abode o£ the Eight Immortals, is a
third supernatural creature associated with strength. lon-
gevity, and (because of the markings on its back) with a
mystic plan of numerals which is a key to the philosophy
of the unseen.
Colours have their ~ignificance, b!ue being the colour
of the heavens, yellow of the earth and the Emperor, red
of the sun, white Of Jupiter or the Year Star, while each
dynasty had its own particular hue, that of the Cho11 dy-
nasty being described as 'blue of the sky after rain where
it appears between the clouds.'
One could go on indefinitely ' reading ' the meaning of
the seemingly fantastic creations of the Chinelte artist-
devotee, but enough has been said to show that the strange
beings. the conventional arrangements, the appuentlv
haphazard conjunction ofobject! in his decorative schemeS
arc far from bemg matter of chance, but add to their decora-
tive propertie~ the intellectual charm o£significance.

The popular imagination may well be excused for sup-
posing that the spirits of the dead continue to hover over
the spot where their bodies are laid. The ancient Greeks
thought that the souls of the dead were especially powerful
near their graves or sepulchres, because of some natural
tie binding soul and body, even after death. The more
gross and earthly a soul was, the less willing was it to
leave the vicinity of its body, and in consequence. spectres
encountered in a churchyard were more to be feared than
those met with elsewhere. The apparitions \\itnessed at
the tombs of saints, however. were to be regarded rath<.r
as good angels than the souls of the saints themselves.

Circe : (Su Greece.)
Circles, Spiritualistic : A group of persons who meet at
intervals for the purpose of ho!dmg seances for spirit
communication. It is essential that at least one among
them be a medium; occasionally there are several mediums
in one circle. But indeed all the members of a circle must
be chosen with care, if the si:ances are to be productive
of phenomena. The naron de Guldcnstubbe, in his
Practical Exptri»umlal Pntumatology, or lite Reality of
Spirits and the Marvellous Phenomtnan af their Direct
IVritir..11, published early in the history of the movement,
gives directions for the forming of a circle after the Ameri-
can fashion.
"Setting aside the moral conditions.'' he says. " whir.h
are equally requisite it is known that AmE-rican Circles
arc based on the distinction of po~itive and electric or
negative magnetic currents.
"The circles consist of twelve persons, representing in
equal proportion~ the po'itivc and ne~ative or sensitive
elements. This distinction does not follow the sex of the
members, though generally women are negative and
sensitive, while men are positive and magnetic. The
mental and physical constitution of each individual must
be studied before forming the circles, for some delicate
women have nuscu!ine qualities, while s~me stro~g
men are, morally speaking, women. A table 1s placed m
a clear and ,·entilated spot; the medium is seated at
one ond and entirely isolated; by his calm and contem-
plative quietud<. he serves as a conductor for the electricity
and it may be noted that a good somnambulist is usually
an excellent medium. The six electrical or negative
dispositions, which are generally recognised by their
emotional qualities and their sensibility, are placed at the
right of the mcc.lium, the ~ost sensitive 1?£ all being !l~xt
to him. The same rule 1S followed \nth the pos1bve
perso;~alities. who are at the left of the medium, with the
most positive among them next to bim. ~n _order to
form a chain, the twelve person each place thetr n~ht hand
on the table, and their left hand on that o£ the ne1ghbour,
thus making a circle round the table. Observe that_ the
medium or medium~. if there be more than one, arc enttrely
isolated from those who form the chain.''
The formation of a circle is accomplished on similar lines
at the present day. M. C~mille Flammari?n state,s t~at
th<. alternation of the sexes 1s generally provtded to · rem-
force the fluids." That the seance may be as productive
when the circle is composed of a few investigators, following
no rules, but their own, has be"n abundantly proY<·d
in recent years. The ooe indispeo~blc feature is the
medium.
Clairaudience ("Clear Heari.t:g") : The ability .to hear. sound!;
inaudible to the normal ear, such as " sptnt " vo1ces; a
faculty analogous to clairvoyance, (q.v.). but considerably
less frequently met with. If cla.iYaudience ~e a_scrib~d
to auditory, as clairvoyance to vtsual, _hallu~oat10n, tts
comparative rareness is accounted for, smce VlSllal hallu-
cination is the more common of the two. At the same-
time there are a goodly number of instances of th~ clair-
audient faculty on record. some of them of a very ptctures-
que nature. (See Spirit Music). Perhaps the best known
Clairvoyance 105 Cock
case is that of Joan of Arc, but she was not the only martyr
who heard the. voices of saints and angels urging them to
the performance of some special task. In spiritualistic
circles the faculty is frequently claimed by mediums, but
distinction must be made between the "inner voice," in
which the latter arc supposed to receive communications
from the denizens of the other world, and an extemalised
voice comparable to an actual physical sound. Frequently
some such physical sounds form the ba;is of an auditory
hallucination, just as the points of light in a cl)'$tal are
said to form points de replre round which the ha.!!ucination
of the ~isualiscr may sha:J?e itself.
Clairvoyance (i.e., "clear viSion") : A term denoting the
suPP.osed supernormal faculty of seeing persons and events
which are distant in time or place, and of which no know-
ledge can reach the seer through the normal sense-channels.
ClairvoyancB may be roughly divided into three cla.sscs--
retrocognition and premonition, or the perception of past
and future events respectively, and the perception of
contemporary events happening at a distance, or outside
the range of the normal VISion. Clairvoya11ce may include
psychometry, second sight, and crystal-gazing, all of which
see. For the early history of clairvoyance, see Divination.
In prophecy, we have a form of clairvoyance extending back
into antiquity, and second-sight also is an ancient form.
It is notable that spiritualism in Great Britain was directly
heralded, about the third decade of the nineteenth century,
by an outbreak of clairvoyance. Among the clairvoyants
of tl)at period may be mentioned Alexis Didier (q.v.). whose
phenomena suggested that telepathy at least entered into
}!is feats, which included the reading of letters enclosed in
sealed packets, the 'Playing of icarlf. with bandaged eyes,
and others of a like nature. Clairvoyat~ce remains to the
present day a prominent feature of the spiritualistic
seance. Though there exists a quantity of evidence,
collected by the members of the Society for Psychical
Research and other scientific investigators, which ,vould
seem to support the theory of a supernormal vision. yet at
the same time it must be acknowledged that many cases
of clairvoyance lend themselves to a more mundane ex-
planation. For instance, it has been shown that it is
almost, if not quite, impossible so to bandage the eyes
of the medium that he cannot make some use of his normal
vision. The possibility of hyper.cs\hesia during trance
must also be taken into account, nor must we overlook
the hypothetical factor of telepathy, which may conceiv-
ably play a part in clairvoyant performances. A private
enquiry agency might also be suggested as a possible source
of some of the knowledge displayed by the professional
clairvoyant. The crystal is, as has been indicated, a
favourite mode of exercising the clairvoyant faculty,
presumably because the hypnotic state is favourable to the
development of the supernormal vision, though it might
also bP. suggested that the conclition thus induced favoured
the risin~ into the upper consciousne~s of kno~vledge
sub-consc10usly gleaned. The term cla~rvoyance ts also
used to cover the power to see discarnate spirits, and is
thus applied to mediumship generally.
C:lan Morna : In Irish romance one of the divisions of the
Fianna, whose treasure bag containing magic weapons
and precious jewels ·of the Danaan age was kept by Fia of
that clan.
C:lavel: Author of Histoire Pittoresque de la Francma.zonnerie.
He hints in it that when Freemasonry in Austria was sup-
pressed by Charles VI., the Order of .Mopses was estab-
lished in its place.
C:Iedonlsm, or in full, Cledonlsmantla, is the good or evil
presage of certain words uttered without premeditation
when persons come together in any way. It also regulated
the words to be used on particular occasioll!l. Cicero says
the Pythagoreans were very attentive to these presages;
and accorq.ing to Pausanius, it was a favourite methQd of
divination at Smyrna, where the oracles of Apollo were
thus interpreted.
Cleromancy was practised by throwing black and white
beans, little bones or dice, and perhaps, stones ; anything.
in short, suitable for lots. A method of practising clero-
mancy in the streets of Egypt is mentioned under the head
of Sortilegc, and the same thing was common in. Rome.
The Thria-an lots. named before. meant indifferently the
&.lme thing ascleroma11cy; it was nothing more than dicing,
only that the objects used bore particular marks o;: charac-
ters. and were consecrated to Mercury, who was regarded
as the pat;:on of this method of divination. For this rea-
son an oliv:e leaf, r.al!ed" the lot of Mercury," was generally
put in the urn in order to propitiate his favour.
Clldomancy ~.hould be exerci~ed when the sun ::>r moon is in.
Virgo. the name should be written upon a key the key
should be tied to a Bible, and both should be hung upon
the nail of the ring-finger of a virgin, who must thrice
softly repeat certain words. According as the key and
book turns or is stationary. the name is to be considered
right or wrong. Some ancients added the seven Psalms
with litanies and sacred prayers. and then more fearful
effects wt.rc produced upon the guilty; for not only the
key and the book turned, but either the impression of the
key was found upon him, or he lost an eye. Another
method of praetismg with the Bible and key, is to place
the street door key on the fiftieth-psalm, close the volume
and fasten it very tightly with the garter of a female; it
is. then suspended to a nail and will turn when the name
of the thief is mentioned. By a third method, twn persons
suspend the Bible between them ; holding the ring of the
key by their two forefingers.
Clothes, Phantom : (See Phantom Dress.)
Cloven Foot : There is an old belief, buttressed by countless
tales of apparitions, that the Devil always appears with a.
cloven foot, as a sort of distinguishing mark. I t has been
suggested that the Evil One, having fallen lower than any
man, is not permitted to take the perfect human form,
but must have some sort of deformity, i.e., the clove~~ foot.
Cock : The cock has always been connected with magicaL
practice in the various parts of the world throughout tile
ages, and is to be considered in more than one light in this
connection. He is the herald of the dawn, and many
examples might be cited of assemblies of demons and
sorcerers where his shrill cry, announcing dayspring, has
put the infernal Sabbath to rout. It is said that for the
purpose of averting such a contingency, sorcerers were
wont to smear the head and breast of the cock with olive
oil, or else to place around his neck a collar of vin~branches.
In many cases the future wa~ divined through the instru-
mentality of this bird. (See Alectryomanoy). It was
also believed that in tho stomach of the cock was found a
stone. called Lappilus Alcctorius, from the Greek name of
the bird, the vtrtilc of which was to give strength and
courage, and which is said to have inspired the gigantic
might of MHo of Crotona.
Originally a native of India, the cock arrived in Europe
in early times, via Persia, where we find him alluded to in
the Zoroastrian books as the beadle of Sraosa, the sun, and
affrighter of demons. Among the Arabs. it is said that he
crows when he ·becomes aware of the presence of jinns.
The Jews received their conception of the cock as a sc,;1.rer
of evtl spirits from the Persians, as did the Armenians, who
say that he greets with his clarion call the guardian angels,
who descend to earth with the day, and that he gives the
key-note to the angelic choirs of heaven to commence their
daily round of song. In India, too, an4 among the Pagan.
Slavs, he was supposed tc>scare away demons from dwelling
Cock 106 Coleridge
places, and was often the first living creature Lotroduced
into a newly-built house. The Jews, however, believe
that it is possible for the cock to become the victim of
demons. and they say that if he upsets a dish he should
be killed. The cock is often used directly in magical
practice. Thus, in Scotland, he is buried under the patients'
bed in cases of epilepsy. The Germans believed that if
a sorcerer throws a black cock into the air, thunder and
lightning will follow, and among the Chams of Cambodia,
a woman who wishes to become a sorceress sacrifices a live
cock on a termite's nest, cutting the bird in tv:o from the
head to the tail, and placing it on an altar, m front of which
she dances and sings, until the two halves of the bird come
t()gether again, and it comes to life and crows. His name
was often pronounced by the Greeks as a cure for the
diseases of animals, and 1t was said by the Romans that
locked doors could be opened with his tail feathers. The
bird was often pictured on amu:etl; in early tin:t·s, and
figured as the symbol of Abraxas, the principal deity of a
Gnostic sect.
The cock is often regarded as the guide of l;ouls to the
underworld, and in this respect was associated by the
Greeks witlt Persephone and Hermes, and the Slavs of
pagan times often sacrificed cocks to lhe dead, and to the
household serpents in which they believed their ancestors
to be reincarnated.. Conversely, the cock was sometimes
pictured as having an infernal connection, especially if
Iris colour be black. Indeed he is often emp~oycd in black
magic, perhaps the earliest instance of this being in the
Atharia Veda. A black cock is offered up to propitiate
the Devil in Hungary, and a black hen was used for the
same purpose in Germany. The Greek syrcns, the Shedim
of the Talmud, and the lzpuzteque, whom the dead Aztec
encounters on the road to Mictlan, the Place of the Dead,
all have cock's feet. There is a widespread folk-belief
that once in seven years the cock lays a little egg. In
Germany it is necessary to throw this over the roof, or
tempests will wreck the homestead, but should the egg
be hatched, it will produce a cockatrice or basilisk. In
Lithuania they put the cock's egg in a pot, and place it in
the oven. From this egg is hatched a I<auks, a bird
with a taillike that of a golden pheasant, which, if properly
tended, will bring its owner great good luck. Gross
mentions in a chronicle of Bale, in Switzerland, that in the
month of August, 1474, a cock of that town was accused
and convicted of laying an egg, and was condemned to
death. He was publicly burned along with his egg, at a
place called Kablenberg, in sight of a great multitude of
people.
The cock was also regarded as having a connection with
light and with the sun, probably because of the redness
of Iris comb, and the ftery sheen of his plumage, or perhaps
because he heralds the day. It is the cock who daily
wakens the heroes in the Scandinavian Asgard. (See
Alectromaney.)
Cock Lane Ghost : The supposed cause of iJ. mysterious out-
break of rappings, apparitions, and similar manifestations
which broke out at a house in Cock Lane, Smithfield,
London, in 1762. The disturbance was of the usual char-
acter of poltergeist hauntings, but for some reason or other
it attracted wide-spread attention in London. Crowds
flocked to the haunted spot, and claimed to have witnessed
the manifestations. The ghost purported to be the spirit
of a former resident in the Cock Lane house, a ?.Irs. Kent,
and stated that she had been murdered by her husband.
The tenant of the house at the time of the disturbance was
a {!lao named Parsons. and it was more than surmised that
he had :....,entcd the ghost for the purpose of blackmailing
the deceased's w()man's husband. The disturbance was
finally traced to Parson's daughter, a girl of eleven, and
Parsons himself was prosecuted and pilloried. (See
Andrew Lang's Cock Laue and Common Sense, (1894).
Coffin Nails : Tn Devonshire it is said that a ring made from
three nails or screws that have been used to fasten a coffin,
and dug up in a churchyard, will act as a charm against
convulsions and fits of every kind.

Coleridge, Samuel Taylor: E1 .~lish author and mystic (I77Z-
t834l· Samuel Taylor Coleridge, one of the greatest of
English poets and critics, was born in the year 1772 at
Ottery St. )lary, Devonshire, his !ather being John Cole-
ridge, a clergyman and schoolmaster, who enjoyed con-
siderable reputation as a theological scholar, and was
author of a Latin grammar. Samuel's childhood was
mostly spent at the native village, and !rom the first his
parents observed that his was no ordinary temperament,
for he showed a marked aversion to games, he even eschewed
the company of other children, and instead gave his time
chiefly to promiscuous reading. ·• At six years of age,"
he writes in one of his letters to his friend, Thomas Poole,
" I remember to have read Belisarius, Robi11SOil Crusoe,
and Philip Quarll, and then I found the Arabicm Nights
Entertainments," while in this same letler he tells how the
boys around him despised him for Iris eccentricity, the
result being that he soon became a confirmed dreamer,
finding in the kingdom of his mind a welcome haven of
refuge from the scorn thus levelled at him.
By the time he was nine years old. Coleridge had shown
a marked predilection for mysticism, in consequence whe~­
of his father decided to make him a clergyman ; and 1n
1782 the boy left home to go to Christ's Hospital, London.
Here he found among his fellow pupils at least one who
shared Iris literary tastes, ::::harles Lamb, and a war.m
friendship quicldy sprang up between the two; while
a little later Coleridge conceived an affection for a you~g
girl called )iary Evans, but the progress of the love affau
was soon arrested, the poet leaving London m J ;90togo to
Cambridge. Bcginnmg his university career as l:.. s.izar
at Jesus College, he soon became known as a brilliant
conversationalist, yet he made enemies by his ex~eme
views on politics and religion, and in 1793, findmg lumself
in various difficulti~. he went back to London where he
enlisted in the t:;th Dragoons. Dought out soon after-
wards by his relations, he returned to Cambridge, a~d in
1794, he published his drama, Tlte Fall of Robesplerre,
while in the following year he was married to Sarah .Fricker,
and in 1796 he issued a volume of Poems. He now began
to preach occasionally in Unitarian chapels, while in 1797
he met Wordsworth, with whom he speedily became
intimate, and whom he joined in publishing Lyric;al Ballads,
this containing some of Coleridge's finest things, notably
The Ancient 11/ariner. N'or was this the only masterp1ece
he wrote at this time, for scarcely was it finished, ere he
composed two other poems of like worth, Christabel and
.Kubla H.ha11; while in 1798 he was appointed Unitarian
minister at Shrewsbury, and after holding this post f~~ a
little while, he went to travel in Germany, the requtstte
funds having been given him by Josiah and Thomas
Wedgwood, both of whom were keen admirers of Cole-
ridge's philosophical powers, and were of op~niou t~at
study on the continent would be of material serv1ce to him.
Among Coleridge's first acts on returning from Germany
was to publish bis translation of Schiller's lVallenstein,
while simultaneously he took a cottage at Keswick, mtend-
ing to live there quietly for many years. But peace and
quiet are benefits usually sought m vain b)' poets. and
Coleridge was no exception herein, for early in life he had
begun to take occasional doses of laudanum, and now this
Coleridge 107 Compaots
practice developed into a habit which ruled his whale life.
In 1804 he sought relief by going to Malta, wl1ile afterwards
he visited :Rome, and though, on returning to England,
he was cheered by finding that a small annuity had been
left him by the Wedgwoods, he was quite incapable of
shaking off this deadly drug habit. As yet, howeYer, it
had not begun to vitiate his gifts altogether; and, after
staying for awhile with Wordsworth at Crasmere, he
delivered a series of lectures on poetry at Bristol and sub-
sequently in London. Especially in the l\Ietropo!is his
genius was quickly recognised, and he was made a pensioner
of the Society of Literature, this enabling him to take a
small house at Highgate; and there he mainly _
spent his
declining years, while it was in Highgate Cemetery that
his remains were interred after his death in 1834·
Everything from Coleridge's hand is penetrated by a
wealth of thought. Apatt from his purely metaphysical
works, of which the most notable are A ids to Heflection
and Co11jessions of an E11quiring Spirit, his Biographia
Literaria and other fine contributions to critical literature
are all of a mystical temper ; for Coleridg8- more, perhaps,
than any other critics, not even excepting Goethe and
Walter Pater-is never content with handling the surface
of things, but alwars rcfte~ts a strivin~; t? unde~tand and
lay bare the mystenous pomt where arbst1c creation begins.
For him, literature is a form of life, one of the most myster-
iou~ _forms of life, and. while .he is supremely quick at
nobcmg purely resthetic ment, and equally quick at
marking defect, it is really the philosophical element in
his criticism which gives it its transcendant value and
interest.
Coleridge's metaphysical predilections are not more
salient in his prose than in his verse. In a singularly
beautiful poem, To the Evening Star, he tells that he gazes
thereon,
•'Till l, myself, all spirit seem to grow."
And in most of his poems, indeed, he is'' all spirit," while
often he hypnotises the reader into feeling something ol
the author'-; spirituality. Here and there, no doubt he
attempt. toeli.'Jlre3s in words things too deep and mysterious
to be resolved into that sadly limited mode of utterance
the resu~t.being a baffling and e:-oen exasperating obscurity;
but wa1vmg altogether Coleridge's metaphysical poems,
may it not be said justly that he introduced the occult
into verse with a mastery wholly unsurpassed in En"'lish
literature? May it not be said that The Ancient Marit:er
and more especially C!.Yislabel, are the most beautiful of
all poems in which the supernatural plays an important
part?

Community of Sensation : The term applied by the early
mesmerists to a phenomenon of the hypnotic trance
wherein the somnambule seemed to share the sematwns of
the operator. Thus an hypnotic subject, insensible to pain
and utterly indifferent to any stimulus applied to his own
organism, would immediately respond to such stimuli
applied to the hypnotist. If the latter had his nose tweaked
or his hair pulled, the entranced subject, though in a
sep3;fate apartment, would rub the corresponding part
or h1s own person. with every sign of pain and indignation.
The most common sensations shared in this wise were those
of tasting and smelling, but apparent community of sight
and even hearing were not unknown. In the days of
Reichenbach such experiences were largely attributed to
fraud, but they have since been proved to be genuine trance
phenomena, probably arising from unconscious suggestion
4ud .hyper:esthesia, or, in the few cases where that hypo-
thesiS will not cover the ground, telepathic communication
between operator and subject. Community of sensation
is not, however, confined to the trance condition. .Many
instances of community of sensatio11 arising spontaneously
in the cases of persons in rapport with one another are to
be found in the ]oumal and Proceedings ol the Society
for Psychical 'He.icarch.
Compacts with the Devil : An anonymous writer has handed
down to us the agreement entered into between Louis
Caufridi and the devil :
" I, Louis, a priest, renounce each and every one of the
spiritual and corporal gifts which may accrue to me from
God, from the Virgin, and from all the saints, and especially
from my patron John the Baptist, and the apostles Peter
and Paul and St. Francis. And to you, Lucifer, now before
me, I give myse!l and all the good I may accomplish,
except the returns from the sacrament in the cases where
I may administer it; all of which I sign and attest ."
On his side Lucifer made the following agreement
with Louis Gaufridi :
" I, Lucifer, bind myself to give you, Louis Caufridi,
priest, the faculty and power of bewitching by blowing
with the mouth, all and any of the women and girls you
may desire; in proof of which I sign myself Lucifer."
Bodiu gives the following : " Magdalen of the Cross,
native of Cordova in Spain and abbess ol a convent, finding
that she was suspected by the nuns and fearing that she
wou:d be burnt if charged, desired to anticipate them,
and obtain the pardon of the pope by confessing that
from the age of twelve years, a bad spirit in the form of
a black llloor had desired her chastity, and that she had
given in, and this had gone on for thirty years or more,
she usually sleeping with him. Through his means while
in the church, she was raised up, and when the nuns took
the Sacrament after the consecration, the host came even
to her in the air, in the sight of the other nuns who re-
garded it as sacred and the priest also, who used to complain
at that time of a host."
According to Don Calmet there is to be seen at Mo:sheim
in the chapel of St. Ignatius in the church of the Jesuit
fathers a well-known inscription giving the history of a
young German nobleman named Michel Louis, of the
family of Boubenhorcn, who '"as sent when quite young
to the court of the Duke of Lorraine to learn French and
there lost a!l his money at cards. Reduced to despair.
he decided to give himself up to the devil if that spirit
of evil could or would give him good money, for he was
afraid that he would be able to supply him only with
counterfeit. While thinking this over a young man
his own age, wel:-built and well-clothco, suddenly appeared
before him and asking him the cause of his distress, put
out his hand full of money and invited him to prove its
worth, telling him to look .him up again on the morrow.
:\fiche! returned to his companions who were still playing,
won back all he had lost and all that of his companions.
Then he ca!led on his devil who asked in return three
drops of blood which he collected in an acorn shell, and
offering a pen to Michel told him to write to his dictation.
This consisted of unknown words, which were taken down
Compacts 108
on two different notes, one of which the devil retained,
and the other was put into the arm of i\Iichel in the same
places from which the blood had been taken. The devil
then said : " I undertake to serve you for seven years,
after which you be:ong to me without reserve." The
young man agreed, though with some dread, and the devil
did not fail to &ppear to him, day and night in various
forms, inspiring him to things varied, unknown and curious
and always with a tendency of evil. The fatal period of
seven years was drawing to a end, and the young man was
then about twenty years of age. He went home to his
father, where the devil to whom he bad given himself
inspired him to poison his father and mother, bum the
castle and kill himself. He tried to carry out all these
crimes, but God prevented their success-the gun with
which he would have ki!led himself missed fire twice, and
the poison failed to act on his parents. Getting more and
more uneasy he confided the unhappy condition he was
in to some of his father's s-ervants and begged them to get
help. At the same time the devil seized him, twisting
his body around and stopping very short of breaking his
bones. His mother, who fo:lowcd the teachings ofSvenfe:d
and had en:isted her son·in them, finding no he:p in her
cult against the demon who poss•.!Ssed or obsessed him,
was forced to put him in the care of some monks. But
he soon left them and escaped to lslade whence he was sent
back to Mo:sheim by his brother, cano., of Wissbourg,
who put him again into the hands of the Fathers of the
Society. It was then that the demon made the most
violent efforts against him, appearing. to him in the form
of wild anima~s. One day among others the demon, in the
form of a man, wi!d and covered with hair, threw on the
ground a note or contract different from the true one
which he had got from the young man, so as to try by this
false show to get him out of the hands of those who were
looking after him and to prevent his making a full con·
fession. Finally the 20th October, I60J, was set aside
for proof in the Chapel of St. Ignatius, and for the repro-
duction of the true contract containing the deal made
....-ith the demon. The young man made profession of the
orthodox catholic faith, renounced the demon and received
the ho:y Eucharist Then 'vith terrible cries he said that
he saw two goats of immense size standing with their fore
feet in the air and each holding between its hoofs one of
the contracts or compacts. But when the exorcism was
begun and the name of St. Ignace was invoked the
two goats disappeared and there issued from the arm or
left hand of the young mao practically without pain and
leaving no scar, the contract, which fell at the feet of
the exorcist. There still remained the contract which
had been retained by the demon. The exorcisms were
begun again, St. Ignatius was invoked and a mass was
promised in his honour, when a stork appeared, large,
deformed and ill-shapen, and dropped from its beak the
second contract, which was found on the altar."
There is frequent mention among the ancients of certain
demons who show themselves, especially towards midday,
to those with whom ther are on familiar terms. They
visit such persons in the form of men or animals or allow
themselves to be enclosed in a tetter, account or phial or
even in a ring, wide and hOllow within. " Magicians are
known," adds Le!oyer, '' who make use of them, and to
my great regret I am forced to admit that the practice
is only too common."
Housdorfin his T !Ittitre d.esexemples du Secomman.dement,"
quoted by Goulart, says: " ~ doctor of medicine forgot
himself so far as to form an alliance with the enemy of our
salvation whom he called up and enclosed in a g!ass from
which the seducer and familiar spirit answered him. The
doctor was fortunate in the cure of ailments, and amassed
Compacts
great wealth in his practice, so much so that h.e left his
children the sum of 78,ooo francs. Shortly before his
de:~.th, when his conscience began to prick him, he fell
into such a frenzy that he never spoke b;.~t to invoke the
devil or blaspheme the Holy Ghost and it was in this un-
fortunate condition that he passed away."
Goulart repeats, from Alexander o{ Alexandria, the
story of a prisoner who had in"oked the help of the devil
and had visited the lower regions :
•• The overlord of a small town in the principality of
Suimona and Kingdom of ~aples, proved very miserly and
arrogant in his rule, so much so that his subjects were too
poor to tive beside his harsh treatment of them. One
of them, honest, but poor and despised, g2.ve a sound beating
for some reason to a hunting dog of this over!ord, and the
death of the dog angered the tatter so much that he had
the poor man seized and shut up in a dungeon. After
some days the warders, who kept the gates carefully iocked
went to open them as usual to give him a crust of bread,
but he was not to be found in his cell. Having looked for
him everywhere, again and again, and finding uo trace
of him nor his method of escape, they at last reported this
wonderful affair to their master, who first ridiculed, and
then threatened them, but realising at length the truth
of it, he was no less astonished than they. Three days
after this alarming incident, and with all the doors of the
prison and dungeon closed as before, this same prisoner,
unbeknown to anyone, was found shut up in his own
dungeon. He was much distracted, and asked to be
taken without delay before the over:ord as he had a matter
of m'llch importance to communicate. \Vheu taken there
he said that he had come back fro:n the lower regions.
His e<:.Se wao; that, not being able to stand aoy longer the
rigors of prison life, overcome with despair, fearing death
and tacking any good advice, he had io,·oked the help of
the devil that he might rele:~osc him from his confinement.
That soon after, the Evil Oue, in a terribly hideous form,
had appeared in his dungeon where they made a bargain,
after which he was dragged out, not without severe injury,
and projected into subterranean passages, wonderfully
ho!lowed out, like the bottom of the earth ; there he had
seen the dungeons of the wici;:cd, their tortures and their
miseries. dark and terrible. Kings, princes and high lords
were plunged into abysses of darkness where, ";th inde-
scriba.b:e torture, they were scared with a raging fire.
That he had seen popes, cardioa!s and other prelates,
beJ.utifully dressed, and other kinds of persons in ,·arying
garb, suffering other anguish in gulfs of great depth,
where the torture was in<!essant. Proceeding, he said he
had recognised some acquaintances and especially a former
great friend of his who, recognising him in return, enquired
as to his condition. The prisoner told him that their
land was in the hands of a crud m:~ster, whereupon the
other charged him to ~ommand. this cruet mast~r. o.n
returning, to renourtce hlS tyranmcal ways, otherw1se hlS
place wOllld be one of the neighbouring seats, which was
shown to the prisoner. And (continued this shade) in
order that the said overlord may bave faith in your report
recan to him the secret counsel and ta:ks we had together
when engaged in a certain war, the chiefs in which he
named, and then he gave in detail the secret, their agree-
ment, the words and promises given on each side. The
prisoner gave them ail distinctly one by one in their order,
and the lord was much astonished at the. message, wondering
how thinas committed to himself and not revealed by him
to any~y. could be so easily and so bo!dly :uotolded
to him by a poor subject of his who told them as 1f he had
read them in a book. Further, the prisoner enquired of
his friend in the lower regions, whether it could be true
that all the magnificently dressed persons that he saw
Compacts 109 Conte Del Graal
were conscious of their torments. The other answered
<:hat they were seared with an eternal fire, overwhelmed
with torture and indescribable anguish, and that a!t this
scarlet and golden raiment was nought but the colouring
of the glowing fire. Wishing to test this he drew near to
touch this scarlet effect and the other begged him to go.
but the fierceness of the fire had scorched the whole of the
palm of his hand, which he showed all roasted and cooked
as in the embers of a great fire. The poor prisoner being
released, to those who met him on his way home he ap-
peared stupid. I le neither saw nor heard anytbinff, was
always deep in thought, spoke little and replied very
shortly to the questions put to him. His face, too, had
become so hideous, his appearance so will and il!-favoured
that his wife and chi!drcn had difficulty in recognising
him again, and when they did it was only to weep and cry
at this change in him. He Jived but a few days alter his
return and so great was his distraction that he ha<i great
difficulty in looking after his affairs."
Crespet describes the ma~Ck with which Satan brands his
own:
" It may be assumed that it is no fallacy but very evident
that Satan's mark on sorcerers is like leprosy, for the spot
is insensitive to a!l punctures, and it is in the possession
of such marks that one recognises them as true sorcerers
for they feel the puncture no more than if they were leprous,
nor docs any blood appear, and never indeed, does any
pain that may be inflicted cause them to move the part."
" They receive, with this badge, the power of injuring
and of pleasing, and. secretly or openly, their children are
made to participate in the oath and connection which the
fathers have taken with the devil. Even the mothers
with this in view, dedicate and consecrate their children
to the demons,· not only as soon as born but even when
conceived, and so it happens that, through the mini-
strations of these demons, sorcerers have been seen with
two pupils in each eye, while others had the picture of a
horse in one eye and two pupils in the other, and such
serve as marks and badges of contracts made with them,
for these demons can engrave and render \n effigy such or
similar lines and features on the bodies of the very young
embryo."
"These marks," says Jacques Fontaine, "are not en-
graved on the bodies of sorcerers by the demons for re-
cognition purposes only, as the captains of companies
of light-horse know those of their number by the colour
of their coats, but to imitate the creator of all things, to
show his power and the authority he has gained over those
miserable beings who have allowed themselves to be caught
by his cunning a:1d trickery, and by the recognition of
these marks of their master to keep them in his power.
Further, to prevent them, as far as possible, from ·with-
drawing from their promises and oaths of fidelity, beca use
though breaking fattt• with him the marks still remain
with them and serve, in an accusation, as a means of be-
traying them, with even the smallest amount of evidence
that may be brought forward."
" Louis Gaufridy, a prisoner, who had just been con-
demned to be burnt . . . . was marked in more than
thirty places over the body and on the loins especially
there was a mark of Just so large and deep, considering the
site, that a needle could be inserted for t he ·width of three
fingers across it without any feeling being shown by the
puncture."
The same author shows that the marks on sorcerers are
areas which have mortified from the touch of the devil's
finger.
" About 1591, Leonarde Chastenet, an old woman of
eighty, was taken up as a sorceress while begging in Poitou.
Brought before Mathurin Bonnevault, who deponed to
having seen her at the meeting of witches, she confessed
that she had been there with her husband, and that the
devil, a Yery disgusting beast, was there iu the form of a
g'?at. She denie<;l that sh~ would ha~e carried out any
Witchcraft, but. mnetcen \vttnesses testified to her having
caused the death of five labourers and a number of animals.
"Finding her crimes discovered and herself condemned
she confessed that she had made a compact with the devil,
given him some of her hair, and promised to do all the
harm she could. She &dded that at night in prison the
devil had appeared to her, in the form of a cat, to which
sne expressed the wish to die, whereupon this devil pre-
sented her with two pieces of wax telling her to eat them
and she would die, but she had been unwilling to do it.
She had the pieces of wax with her, but on examination
their composition could not be made out. She was then
condemned and the pieces of wax burnt with her."
Compass Brothers :-Between the years 1400 and 1790,
there existed at Lubeck a guild of this name, which met
twice a year. Their badge was a compass and sector
suspended from a crowned letter " C," over which was a
radtated triangular plate. In 1485 they adopted chains
composed of these emblems united by eagles' tails. They
appear to have been a magical or Kabbalistic society.
Conan Mac Morna :-A figure in the Ossianic cyc!e of Irish
legend, described as scoffing and deriding all that was
high and noble. One day while hunting, he and others of
the Fians, entered a magnificent palace which they found
empty and began to feast. It soon becc.me apparent,
however, that the palace was enchanted, and the walls
shrank to the size of a fox's hole. Conan seemed to be
unaware of the danger and continuer! to eat; but two of
the Fians pulled him off his chair, to which some of his
skin stuck. To soothe the pain a black sheep-skin was
placed on his back, on to which it grew, and he wore it
tiil he died.
Conary Mor :-A legendary High King of Ireland. It is
said that his great-grandfather destroyed the Fairy Mound
of Bri-Lcith, and thus brought down ill-fate upon ConaYy
MoY. When a chi!d he te{t his three foster-brothers on
the Plains of Liffey, 1\nd followed a ll.ock of beautiful
birds down to the shore. These were transformed into
armed men, who told him that Lhey belonged to his father
and were his kin. His geise (or taboo) was made known to
him. and later he was proclaimed King of Erin. His
reign was good, happy and prosperous, until the Danaan
folk Jured him to the breaking of his gei!e. It is told how
ConaYy, dying of thirst after battle, sent his warrior Mac
Cecht to bring him water. Mac Cecht had much difficulty
in obtaining this, and on his return found that Conayy
had been beheaded: the water, however, was raised to
t he mouth of the bodyless head-which, it is said, thanked
Mac Cecht for his deed.
Conferentes :-Gods of t.he ancieuts, spoken of by Arnobe,
whom Leloyes identifies with incubi.
ConJuretors :-Magicians who claim to have the power to
evoke demons and tempests
Conte Del Graal :-One of the " Quest " versions of the
legend of the Holy Grail (q.v.) compiled by various authors.
It tells how Perceval was reared to the life of a forester
by his mother ; but forsalcing her he becomes a member
of the Court of King Arthur. Thence he goes forth as a
knight-errant , and his numerous adventures are recited.
D uring these, he meets with certain mysteries, but returns
to the court. The adventures of Gauvain, another of the
Jmights are fully detailed. Perceval, himself, sets forth
again, and wanders about for five years in a very godless
state of mind. One Good Friday he meets with a band
of pilgrims, who remonstrate with him for riding armed
on a holy day ; and he turns aside to confess to a hermit
Control 110 Crollius
who turns out to be llis uncle. From him he learns tllat
only the sinless can find the Crail, and that he has sinned
in abandoning his mother, and thus causing her death.
In a continuation of the legend by a different author,

Control :-A spiritua!istic term, denoting the spirit who
co,!lto!s the physical organisation of a medium.-(See
Spiritualism.)
Convulsionarles of St. Me:lard : During the first half of the
eighteeath century there occurred in the cemetery of
St. ~edard, Paris, an extraordinary outbreak of convulsions
and re!igious extMy, whose victims were the Jansen:.Sts, at
that time suffering much persecution at the hands of the
government and the church. The outbreak commenced
with a few isolated cases of miraculous healing. One,
Mlle. :.'.Iorsaron, a llaralytic, having for her confessor an
enthusiastic Jansemst, was recommended by him to seek
the tomb of St. Francis de Paris, in the cemetery of St .
.Medard. \Vhcn she had repaired thither a few times she
recovered her health. The news spread abroad, and other
cures followed. Violent convulsions became a feature
of the crisis which preceded these cures. At length the
healing by Deacon Paris of a more than usually obstinate
case, by a crisis of more than ordinary severity, was the
signal for a violent outburst of epidemic frenzy. People
of both sexes and all ages repaired to the tomb of the holy
deacon, where the most appalling scenes were witnessed.
People from the provinces helped to swell the ranks, till
there was not a vacant foot of ground in the neighbourhood
of St. :.'.Iedard. At length, on January 27th, 1732, the
cemetery was closed by order of the king. On its closed
gate a wit inscribed the Jines:
De par lc roi defense a Dieu
De faire miracle en ee lieu.
However the Icing's ordinance did not put an end to the
epidemic, which spread from Paris to many other towns.
Ten years after its commencement-in 1741-it seemed to
have died away, but in 1759 it burst out in Paris with
renewed vigour, accompanied by scenes still more awful.
In the following year it disappeared once more, though
isolated examples persisted so late as 1787.
Cook, Florence : An English medium, the first to present
the phenomenon of matcrialisation in its complete form.
In the production of the crowning physical manifestation,
she was associated at the outset of her mediumist:c career-
at the beginning of the decade 187o-8o-with the medium
Herne, but ere long dispensed with his assistance. So that
she might not be under the necessity of taking fees for
her services, a wealthy Manchester spiritualist. Mr. Charles
Blackburn, paid her a sum of money annqally. She was
thus practically a priva~e medium, and for the most part,
her seances wore held 1n her own home. Her principal
control was the now famous spirit Katie King. 1\lr.-
now Sir William- Crookes, who investi"ated the
P!lenom~n~ produced .in ~1iss Cook's presence': declared
hts convtcbon that l(atle and the medium were two separat e
entities, and was satisfied of tile supernormal nature of
the ~ormer. Not all the sitters, however, were equally
convmced. Many persons traced a resemblance in form
and feature between medium and control, and it has been
suggested that the apparent diCferences were achieved by
a change in the mode of hair-dressing, by tip-toeing, and
other mechanical means.

and children from evil spirits, goblins, and sorceresses.
It a!so strengthens digestion, and if taken in powder as

Corbenlc : A magic castle of the Arthudan legend, in which
it is said the Holy Crail was kept. It was guarded by two
lions. Lancclot tries to enter it by his own strength, in-
instead of leaning on his Creator, and as a result is struck
dumb by a fiery wind. In this state he rem'\ins for fourteen
days without food or drink.

ca11dles.
Coscinomancy is practised with a sic\ c, and a pair of tongs
or shears, which arc supported upon the thumb nails of two
persons, who look one upon the other, or the nails of the
middle finger may be used. Potter, in his Greek .-!ttliquities,
says : ·• It was generally used to disco,·cr thieves, or others
suspected of any crime, in this manner: they tied a thread
to the sieve by wh.ich it was upheld, or e!sc placed a pair
of shears, which they held up by two ftngcrs, then prayed
to the gods to direct and assist them ; after that they
repeated the names of the persons under suspicion, and he,
at whose name the sieve whirled round or moved, was
thought guilty." In the Athenia11 Oracle it is called "the
trick of the sieve and scissors, the coskiomancy of the
ancients, as old a~ Thcocritus," he having mentioned in
his third idyll. a woman who was verySkllfulin it. Saunders,
in his Chiromaucy, and Agrippa, at the end of his works,
gives certain mystic words to be pronounced before the
sieve will turn. It \\'M used to discover love secrets
as well as unknown persons. According to Crose, a
chapter in the Bible is to be read, and the appeal made to
St. Peter or St. Paul.
Costume, Phantom : (See Phantom Dress.)
Counter Cbarm.s : Charms employed to countcmct the
effect of other charms. 'When magicians wish to dis-
enchant animals they sprinkle salt in a porringer with some
blood from one of the bewitched creatures, and repeat
certain formula! for nine days.
Counts of Hell : Demons of a superior o~der in the infernal
hierarchy, who command numerous legions. They may
be evoked at all hours of the day, provided the evocation
takes place in a wild. unfrequented spot.

Cramp.Rings, Hallowing : A ceremony which took place in
England on Good Friday. It consisted of the repetition
of certain psalms and prayers, during which the king
rubbed the rings between his hands. It was said that
rings thus consecrated on Good Friday by the kings of
England, had the power of curing cramp ; and the rings,

Crollius, Oswald : A discillle of the school of Paracelsus,
and author of the Book of Signatures-the preface to which
contains a good sketch of hermetic philosophy. The
writer seeks to demonstrate that Cod and Nature have,
so to speak, signed all their works, that every product of
a given natural force is as the sum of that force, printed
in indelible characters, so that he who is initiated in the
occult writings can read as in an open book the sympathies
and antipathies of things, the properties of substances,
and all other secrets of creation. " The characters of
different writings," says Eliphas Levi, " were borrowed
primitively from these natural signatures existing in stars

figures of crystals, the marks on minerals, were impressions
of the thought which the Creator had in their creation.
But we lack any grammar of this mysterious
langua~e of worlds. and a mathematical vocabulary of
this pnmitive and absolute speech. King Solomon alone
is credited with having accomplished the dual labour, but
the books of Solomon are lost. The enterprise of Crollitts
was not the reconstitution of these, but an attempt to
discover the fundamental principles obtaining in the
universal language of the creative world. It was recog-
nised in these principles that the original bie1oglyphics,
based on the prime elements of geometry, corresponded to
the constitutive and essential laws of forms, determined by
alternating or. combined movements, which, in their tum,
were determined by equilibratory attractions. Simples
we.-e distinguished from composites by their external
figures ; and by the correspondence between fiG"1!res and
numbers it became possible to make a mathematical
classification of a!l substances revealed by the lines of their
services. At the root of these endeavours, whioh are
reminiscences of Edenic science, there is a whole world of
discoveries awaiting the scit:nces. •Paracelsus had defined
them, Crollius indicates them, another, who shall follow,
will realise and provide the demonstration concerning them.

Cross-Correspondences : Corresl?ondcnces found in the sctipt
of two or more automatic wnters acting without collusion,
and under such conditions that the possibility of com-
munication by normal means is removed. Since the begin-
ning of the p.rcsent century efforts have been made by
members of the Society for Psychical Research to prove,
by the production of script containing cYoss-corrt'spondence,
the existence of discarnate intelligences, and their ability
to operate through the physical organism of a medium.
The first instances were of a spontaneous character, and
occurred in the trance utterances of Mrs. Thompson and
those of another medium, Miss Rawson. Thereafter the
idea was conceived of deliberately cultivating them, and
several ladies-Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Holland, and others-
who had been successful in producing automatic script,
sent it to the Society for Psychical Research, where the
writings were found to show more numerous correspond·
ences than mere coincidence would warrant. It was
arranged that experiments should be made under stricter
test conditions. Frequently the script of Mrs. Verrall
was of an allusive and enigmatical character, so that she
herself was unable to interpret it until the key had been
supp!ie<l by the writings of a second automatist. Some-
times three automatists succeeded in producing writings
having a decided connection wth each other. Two obscure
writings have been rendered intelligible by means of a
third, perhaps in itself equally obscure. In at least one
case correspondences occurred in the script of no less than
six automatists, under somewhat curious circumstances.
1\Ir. Piddington, a well known member of the Society for
Psychical Research, had written a " test " letter, which
he proposed should be opened after his death. The con-
tents, which dealt emphatically with the number seven,
he told to no one. On hearing, however, of the remarkable
cross-correspondences-all dealing with the number seven-
he opened his letter, four years after it was written, and
supplied the clue. In 19o6, Mrs. Piper was brought to
thi~ country so that the correspondences might be studied
to better advantage. The experiments were successful
to a surprising degree, and seemed to place beyond a
doubt the operation in all the writings of an intelligence
other than the automatist's. Mr. Podmore, however,
would refer the phenomena of cross-correspondenus, at
!east in part, to the operation of a complex form of tele-
pathy-a possible, but in view of the facts, not very
probable. exptanation.

Crystalomaney, or Crystal Gazing : A mode of divination
practised from ,·err early times with the aid of a crystal
globe, a pool of water, a mirror, or indeed any transparent
object. Divinations by means of water, ink, and such
substances are also known by the name of hydromaacy
(q.v.). Crystalgazing maybea verysimple ora very elaborate
performance, according to the period in which it was
practised, but in every case the obj ect is to induce in the
clairvoyant a form of hypnosis, so that he may sec visions
in the crystal. The •' crystal " most in favour among
modern crystal gazers is a spherical or oval globe, about
four inches in diameter, and preferably a genuine crystal ;
but as a crystal of this size and shape is necessarily ex·
pensive, a sphere of glass is frequently substituted, and
with very good results. It must, however, be a perfect
sphere of oval, free from speck or flaw, hi~hly polished,
and contained in a stand of polished ebony, 1vory, or box-
wood. Among the Hindus, a cup of treacle or a pool
of ink is made to serve the same purpose. Precious stones
were much used by crystallomancers in the past, the favour-
ite stone being the beryl in pale sea green or reddish tints.
By the ancients crystallomancy was practised with a view
to the invocation of spirits, and very elaborate preparations
and ceremonials were considered necessary. He who
would practise invocations in this wise must, in the first
instance, be a man of pure life and religious disposition.
For the few days immediately preceding the inspection of
the crystal, he must make fre9.uent ablutions, and s ubject
himself to strict religious disciphne, with prayer and fasting.
The crystal, a.'> well as the stand on which it rests, must be
inscribed with sacred characters, as must also the floor
of the room in which the invocation is to take place. A
quiet, retired spot is suggested for the purpose, where the
magician may be free from all disturbance. Besides these
matters of solitude and cleanliness, there is the question
of the mental attitude to be considered, and th1s is no
less important th-an the material preparations. A perfect
faith is an essential condition of success. If the magician
would be accompanied by one or two of his friends, they
also must conform to the same rules and be guided by the
same {lrinciples. The time of the invocation is chosen
accordmg to the position in the heavens of the various
planets, all preparations having been made during the
increase of the moon. All the instruments and accessories
used in the performance-the sword, rod and compasses,
the fire and the perfume to be burned ther'eon, as well as
the crystal itself-are consecrated or "charged" prior
to the actual ceremony.
During the process of invocation, the magician faces the
east and summons from the crystal the spirit he desires.

D
Dactylomancy: A term covering various forms of divination
practised with the aid of rings. One method resembles
the table-rapping of modern spiritualism. A round table
is inscribed with the letters of the alphabet, and a ring
suspended above it. The ring, it is said, will indicate
certain letters, which go to make up the message required.
It was used, according to Ammianus Marcellinus, to find
Valen's successor, and the name Theodosius was correctly
indicated. Solemn services of a religious character ac-
companied this mode of divination. Another form of
dacJylomai!Cy, of which there is no detailed account, was
practised with rings of gold, silver, copper, iron or lead,
which were placed on the finger-nails m certain conjunc-
tions of the planets. A wedding ring is, however, most
in favour for purposes of this sort. Another way is to
suspend the ring within a glass tumbler, or just outside
of it so, that the ring on being swung may easily touch
the gla%. As with table-rapping, a code may then be
arranged, the glass being struck once for an affirmative,
twice for a negative answer, and so on. Suspended above
a sovereign, the ring will indicate the person (rom whose
head hair has been tal<en, or, if requested, any other
member of the company.

Daemonologie: by King James VI. and J.: It is customary
nowadays to sneer at the writings of this royal author, ar.d
as Horace Walpole remarks, his majesty really has more
critics than readers ; while it should be borne in mind that
in his own day the king's books were greatly admired,
winning the encomiums of Bacon, Izaak' 'Walton, and nu-
merous equally eminent men of l.,ttcrs. In general, how-
ever, it was Basi/icon Doron which elicited their homage,
and compared to this last the Icing's study of demonology
is but a mediocre performance. Published in 1597, it is
couched "in forme of ane di2.logue," the speakers being
Philomathes and Epistemon; and the former, being very
incredulous as regards all kinds of magic, asks Epistemon
to enlighten him. Thereupon many famous acts of witch-
craft are adduced, but, when Philomathes requests to be
told precisely why the black art should be considered in-
iquitous, his interlocutor fails conspicuously to give a satis-
factory answer. lie merely inveighs a-gainst the practice
in question, and accordingly there is something distinctly
trite in the subsequent pages, wherein Epistcmon is
represented as being .converted to the other speaker's
point of view, and declaring loudly that all sorcerers and
the like " ought to be put to death according to the Law
of God, the civill and imperi2.ll Law, and municipall Law
of 2.11 Christian Nations."
Dalver-Logum : The dwelling place of the dai'\·ers (q.v.) a
species of Hindoo genii. BeSides the daivers, who number
three hundred and thirty millions, there dwell in the Daive-r-
Logum those heroes and p~ophets who are not yet fit for
the paradise of Shiva or of Vishnu.
Daivers and Daivergoel : Hindoo genii inhabiting the Dciver-
Logum, a world of their own. They are, it seems, related
to the Persian divs, from which it is !;uggested that the
word "devil" is derived. They possess material bodies
as well as spiritual, and have many human attributes, both
good and evil. Their king is called Daivuntren, or Indiren,
his wife Inderannee, anq his son Seedcra-hudderen. The
latter records the actions of human beings, by which they
must at last be judged. In Daivuntren's immense court
of audience there is r?<>m not only for the daivers them-
selves, but for a multitude of attendants, or companions.
These are the kuinarer, the musicians of Daiver-Logum;
D~mbarim, Nardir, the drummers ; Kimprusher, winged
bClngs of great beauty, who wait on the daiveYS · Kun<la-
gaindoorer, similar beings, the messengers ot' Vishnu ;

those bemgs who attend them in their aerial flights ; Kan-
nanad~r, or Dor~anks, the me~engers who lead devotees
of Sh1va and V1sbnu to paradtse, and the v.<icked to hell.
T~ere is yet another class of daivergoel, or genii, which com-
pnses the eigl~t keepers of the eight sides of the world,
known by their general name of Aushtatiken-Pauligaur.
These are lndiren, or Daivuntren, their king ; Augne·
Bangauven, god of fire ; Eemen, king of death and hell ;
~erudee, the earth-element personified as a giant; Vaivoo,
god of the air and winds ; Varooner, god of the clouds and
rain ; Gooberen, ~od of riches ; and Essaunien, Shiva
himself, in one of h1s r,oo8 incarnations.

Dalton, Thomas : The history of this alchemist is veiled in
obscurity, but he appears to have lived about the middle
of the fifteenth century ; and, as he is mentioned in the
0Ydinall of A/chimy by Thomas Norton, it is likely that he
was a pupil or at least n friend of the latter. Da/l.qn was
a churchman, resident at an abbey in Gloucester; and it
is reported that, on one occasion, he was brought b'efore
th~ king, Edward IV., in whose rresence he was ch2.rged
with the surreptitious practice o magic, in those days a
capital crime. His accuser was one Debois, to whom the
unfortunate alchemist had at one time been chaplain, and
this Debois affirmed upon oath that he had seen the ac-
cused create a thousand pounds of pure gold within the
space of a single day. Thereupon Dalton reminded his
accuser that he had sworn never to reveal this or any kin-
dred facts. 'Debois acknowledged his perfidy herein, yet
added that he was acting for the good of the commonwealth.
The 2.lcbemist then addressed the Icing himself, telling him
that he had been given the powder of projection by a cer-
tain Canon of Litchfield, and that since then he h2.d been
in so constant a state of trepidation that he had ultimately
destroyed the precious article. Edward accordingly
granted him his freedom, at the same time giving him
money sufficient for his journey home; but on his way
there he was seized by a certain Thomas Herbert, who had
heard of the accusation brought against the churchman,
and was naturally inquisitive. Herbert carried his victim
to the castle of Gloucester, and, incarcerating him in a cell
there, tried every means to make him disclose the secret
at issue. All was in vain, however, and at length Dalton
was condemned to death by his persecutor, and brought.
out to be beheaded in the courtyard of the castle. He
placed his head on the block, and, crying out to God to
receive his soul, he called upon the executioner to strike
speedily ; but now a strange scene was enacted, for hardly
was the axe raised ere Herbert sprang forward to avert
it, at the same time declaring that he dared not shed inno-
cent blood. In short, the projected execution was no more
than a d2.stardly ruse, the persecutor im2.gining that the
alchemist would confess all when his life was at stake;
and, as the plan had failed, Dalton was allowed to go free.
So he returned to his abbey in Gloucestershire, and there
be lived quietly and unmolested for the rest of his days.

Danaans, The : The people of the goddess Dana, often men-
tioned in Irish medieval romance. They were one of the
three ~emedian families who survived the Fomorian vic-
tory, and· returned to Ireland at a later period. By some
it was said that they came " out of heaven," and by others
that they sprang from four cities, in which they learned
science and craftsmanship, and from each of which they
brought away a magical treasure.. From Falias t hey
brought the Stone of Destiny (Lia Fail) (q.v.) ; from Gorias
an invincible sword ; from Finias a magical spear ; and
from iVIurias the Cauldron of the Dagda. They were be-
lieved to have been wafted to Ireland on a magic cloud,
carrying their treasures with them. After a victorious
battle they took possessio~ of the whole of Irel!lnd, except
Connacht which was g1ven to the vanqulShed. The
Da11aans were the representatives of power and beauty,
of science and poetry, to the writer of the myth ; to the
common people they were gods ~f earth. In t?eir battles
they were subject to death,- but 1t was by magteal powers
that they conquered their mortal foes.

Davenport Brothers (Ian and William) : Two American
mediums who gave seances for physical phenomena in
America and Britain during the decade x86o-7o. They
seem to have attained to a considerable measure of fame,
and to have won a great many people to the belief that
their ~crformances were genuine spirit manifestations.
On their coming to England in x864 they were accompanied
by a chaplain, the Rev. J . 'B. Ferguson, who helped to
inspire confidence in their good faith. The usual plan of
their seances was as follows : The Brothers Davenport took
their seats vis-a-vis in a small walnut cabinet" made very
like a wardrobe or clothes-press." Any two gentlemen
from among the audience were requested to bind them
firmly to their benches, so as to preclude any possibility
of their freeing their hands. Musical instruments were
then placed in the cabinet, apparently out of reach of the
medium, an.d the lights were lowered. Soon the musical
instruments began to play within the cabinet, dim " spirit
hands " were seen in front of it. At the conclusion of the
seance, however, the mediums were found tied as securely
as ever. They mel with a check, however, on their pro-
vincial tour, for at Liverpool there were two men among
the audience who possessed the secret of a special knot.
The" Tom Fool's knot," as it was called, baffted the spirits,
and the mediums were mobbed. Later in a seance given
before a committee of the Anthropological Society, they
shirked nearly all the conditions, and succeeded in accom-
plishing nothing which could not be done by a skilful con-
jurer. Tolmagne. Anderson, and oUter conjurers emulated
their feats, and ll!askelyne and Cooke so successfully that
mediums had no resource bubtoclass themas"fellow-adepts."

Davies, Lady : Eleanor Tuchet, daughter of George, Lord
Audley, married Sir John Davies. an eminent lawyer in
the time of James the First, and author of a poem of con-
siderable merit on the Immortality of the Soul. This lady
was a person of many talents ; but what she seems most
to have valued herself upon, was her gift of prophecy ; and
she accordingly printed a book of Strange and Wonderful
Predictions. She professed to receive her prophecies from
a spirit, who communicated to her audibly things about
to come to pass, though the voice could be heard by no
other person. Sir John Davies was nominated lord chief
justice of the king's bench in r6z6. Before he was in-
ducted into the office, lady Eleanor, sitting with him on
Sunday at dinner, suddenly burst into a passion of tears.
Sir john asked her what made her weep. To which she
replied "These are your funeral tears." Sir john turned
off the prediction with a merry answer. But in a very
few days he was seized with an apoplexy, of which he pres-
ently died. She also predicted the death of the duke of
Buckingham in the same year. For this assumption of
the gift of prophecy, she was cited before the high-com-
mission-court and c"amined in •634.
Davis, Andrew Jackson : Known as the" Poughkeepsie Seer"
from his residence in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., was a prophet,
clairvoyant, and mystic philosopher, who commenced his
mission to the world about 1844, some time before the
Rochester Rappings had inaugurated the movement known
as" modern spiritualism." In r847 he published a volume
of trance discourses, The Princ~ples of Nature, Her Diui1ze
Revelations, and A Vo~ce to Jl,fanhi,zd. In the same year
he issued the first number of the U1zivercalutn, a periodical
devoted to clain·orance and trance ~henomena generally,
which continued till 1849. Not until 1850, however, did
Davis and his followers identify themselves with the spirit-
ualists. In his Revelations the Poughkeepsie Seer pro-
pounds his Harmonia! Philosophy, afterwards to be elab-
orated in many volumes. His mission, revealed to him
by Galen and Swedenborg, wac; the prophesying of a new
dispensation, preceded by a social revolution. He was
associated, throughout Ins career, with many prominent
spiritualists.
Death-Coach : There is a widespread superstitious belief
that death goes round in a coach picking up souls. The
form of the belief varies, of course, with the locality. In
some parts of England and Wales the death-coach passes
silently at midnight, without sound of hoof or wheels.
Both coach and horse are black, and a black hound runs
in front. In some localities the horses and coachman are
headless, which doubtless adds to the effectiveness of the
apparition. The Breton peasant hears the approach at
midnight of a cart with a creaking axle. It is the Anko11
death- and when the cart stops before a dwelling some-
one within must die.
Death-watch : The ti<.king of the death-watch-a small in-
sect found in decaying wood- is thought by the super-
stitious to presage death.
Decem Viri : (See Sibylline Books.)
Deetera : A figure of frish medieval romance. She was the
daughter of Cathbad the Druid, and mother of Cuchu-

the court of Conor mac ::-Tessa. Three years later, while
pursuing a flock of birds which were spoiling the crops,
the king and courtiers cam.: upon a magnificent palace
inhabited by a youth of noble mten and a beautiful woman
and fifty maidens. These wen recognised as Dectera and
her companions. and the youth as Lugh, the sun-god.
Conor summoned Dec/era to him, but she sent him instead
her new-born son, Cuchulain.
Dee, John: Born in London 1527, this remarkable mathe-
matician and astrologer is supposed to have been d~cended,
from a noble old Welsh House, the Dee.<; of Nanty Groe$
in Radnorshirc; while he himself affirmed that among
his direct ancestors was Roderick the Great, Prince of
Wales. Dee's father appears to have been a gentleman
server at the courl of Henry VIII., and, being consequently
in tolerably affluent circumstances, he was able to give
his son a good education. So at the age of fifteen ]olin
proceeded to Cambridge, and after two years there he took
his degree as Bachelor of Arts ; while a litlle later on his
becoming intensely interested in astronomy and the like,
he decided to leave England and go and study abroad.
In 1547, accordingly, ltc went to the Low Countries, where
he consorted with numerous scholars, and whence he even-
tually brought home the ftrst astronomer's staff of brass,
and also two gloves constructed by Gerard Mercetor; but
Dee was not destined to remain in his native land for long,
and in 1548 he lived for some time at Louvain, and in 1550
he spent several months in Paris, lecturin~ there on the
principles of geometry. He wao; offered, mdeed, a per-
manent post at the Sorbonne; but he declined this. and
in 1551 he retumed to England, where. IJ.aving been recom-

mended to Edward Vl., he was granted the rectory of
Upton-upon-Severn, Worccstershire.
The astrologer was now in a delightful and enviable
position, having a comfortable home and assured income,
and being able to devote himself exclusively to the studies
he loved. But hardly had he begun to enjoy these bene-
fits ere an ugly cloud darkened his horizon, for, on the
accession of Queen Mary in 1553, he was accused of try-
ing to take the new sovereign's life by thaumaturgic
means, and was imprisoned at Hampton Court. He gained
his liberty soon afterwards, but he felt verv conscious that
many people looked on him askance on account of his
scientific predilections ; and, in a preface which he wrote
for an English translation of Euclid, he complains bitterly
of being regarded as "a companion of the helhounds, a
caller and a conjuror of wicked and damned spirits." How-
ever, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth his fortunes
began to improve again ; and after making another long
tour abroad, going on this occasion so far afield as St.
Helena, he took a house at Mortlake on the Thames, and
while staying there he rapidly became famous for his inti-
mate knowledge of astronomy. I n 1572 on the advent
of a new star, people .flocked to hear Dee descant on the
subject ; while five years later, on the appearance of a
mysterious comet, the scholar was a~ain vouchsafed ample
opportunity of displaying his learmng, Elizabeth herself
being among those who came to ask him what this addition
to the stellar bodies might portend.
The most romantic circumstances in Dee's life, however,
are those which dcal·with his experiments in crystallomancy.
Living in comparative solitude-practising astrology for
bread, but studying alchemy for pleasure-- brooding over
Talmudic mysteries and Rosicrucian theories-immersed
in constant contemplation of wonders which 11e longed
to penetrate-and dazzled by visions of the elixir of life
and the Philosopher's Stone, Dee soon attained to such
a condition of mystic exaltation that his visions became
to him as realities, and he persuaded himself that he was
the favoured of the Invisible. In his Diary he records
that he first saw in his crystal-globe--that is, saw spirits-
on the 25th of May, 1581. In another year he had at-
tained to a higher level, and one day, in November, 1582,
while on his knees and fervently praying, he became aware
of a sudden glory which filled tho: west window of his lab-
oratory, and in whose midst shone the bright angel Uriel.
It was impossible for Dee to speak. His tongue was frozen
with awe. But Uriel smiled benignly upon him, gave
him a convex piece of crystal, and told him that when he
wished to communicate with the beings of another world
he had but to examine it intently, and they would imme-
diately appear and reveal the mysteries of the future.
Then the angel vanished.
Dee, however, found from experience that it was needful
to concentrate all one's faculties upon the crystal before
the spirits would obey him. In other words, it was neces-
sary to stimulate the imagination to the highest pitch,
until the soul became a willing agent in its self-deception.
Bring the will to bear upon the imagination, and it
is possible to realize a spirit in every shadowy corner-to
hear the song of the spirits in the low crooning of the evening
wind- to read in the starry heavens the omens and por-
tents of the future. One may become with marvellous
ease the deceiver of one-seH,-the dupe of one's own de-
lusions,-and brood upon a particular subject until one
passes the mysterious border between sanity and madness
- passes from imagination into mania.
Dee could never remember what the spirits said in their
frequent conversations with him. When the excitement
was over, he forgot the fancies with which he had been
beguiled. He resolved, therefore, to discover some fellow-
worker, or neophyte. who should converse with the spirits
while he himself, in another part of the room, sat and re·
corded the interesting dialogue. He found the assistant
he sought in one Edward Kelly, who unhappily possessed
just the requisite boldness and cunning for making a dupe
of the amiable and credulous enthusiast.
Edward Kelly was a native of Lancashire, born, accord-
ing to Dee's own statement, in 1.55.5. \Ve know nothing
of his early years, but after having been convicted at Lan-
caster of coining-for which offence he lost his ears-he
remo,red to Worcester, and established himself as a druggist.
::iensual, ambitious, and luxurious, he longed for wealth,
and despairing of securing it by honest industry, began
to grope after the Philosopher's Stone, and to employ what
magical secrets he picked up in imposing upon the ignorant
and profligate. Dee sou~ht knowledge for the love of it;
Kelly as a means to grabfy his earthly pa.~sions. He con-
cealed the loss of his ears by a black skull-cap, and being
gifted with a good figure and tolerably handsome counte-
nance, looked the very incarnation of mysterious wisdom,
Before his acquaintance with Dee began, he had obtained
some repute as a necromancer and alchymist, who could
make the dead utter the secrets of the future. One night
he took a wealthy dupe with some of his servants, into
the park of Walton le Dale, ncar Preston in Lancashire,
and there alarmed him with the most terrific incantations.
He then inquired of one of the servants whose corpse had
been last buried in the neighbouring churchyard, and being
told that a poor man had been interred there within a very
few hours, exhumed the body, and pretended to draw from
it oracular utterances.
Dee appears to have had a skryer, or seer before his in-
troduction to Kelly, who was named Barnabas Saul. He
records in his Diary on the 9th of October, 1581, that the
unfortunate medium was strangely troubled by a" spiritual
creature" about midnight. On the 2nd of December he
willed his skryer to look into the " great crystalline globe"
for the apparition of the lloly angel Anael. Saul looked
and saw. But llis invention appears to have become ex-
hausted by the following March, when he confessed that
he neither saw nor heard any spiritual creature any more ;
whereat the enthusiastic Dee grew strangely dissatisfied,
and soon dismissed the unsatisfactory and unimaginative
medium. Then came Edward Kelly {who appears to have
been also called Talbot). and the conferences with the
spititl: rapidly increased in importance as well as curiosity.
A clever rogue was Kelly. Gifted with a fertile fancy
and prolific invention, he never gazed into the "great
crystalline globe" without making some· wondrous
discoveries, and by his pretended enthusiasm gained the
entire confidence of the credulous Dee. T he mathema-
tician, despite his learning and his profound intellect,
became the easy tool of the plastic, subtle Skryer. The
latter would sometimes pretend that he doubted the inno-
cent character of the work upon which he was engaged ;
would affect a holy horror of the unholy; and profess
that the spirits of the crystal were not always " sptrits of
health," but-perish the t hought t-" goblins damn'd ;''
demons whose task it was to compass their destruction.
The conferences held between Kelly and the spirits were
meanwhile, carefully recorded by Dr. Dee ; and whoe':'er
has stomach for the perusal of a great deal of absurd.tty
.illd not a little blasphemy, may consult the folio published
in 1659 by the learned Mcric Casaubon, and entitled " A
True and Faithful Relation of what passed between Dr.
john Dee and some Spirits; tending, had it succeeded,
to a General Alteration of most States and Kingdoms in
the World."
T wo such shining lights could not hide themselves under
a bushel, and their reputation extended from Mortlake

even to the Continent. DJc no .v d::cllred himself oo:>scssed
of the elixir vitae, which h2 h'ld found he said, among
the ruins of Gla~ tonbury Abbey; so that the curious were
drawn to his house bv a dollblc attraction. Gold flowt>d
into his c:~fiers in an exhaustless stream, but his experiments
in the tcan~mutation of m..:t.ds absorbed a gre::.t port!on
of his substance.
At this time the court of En!{land was visited by a Polish
nol>lem>.n named Albert L::.ski, Count Palatine of Siradz,
who was desirous to see t!:lc m.J..,;nificence uf the f:lmous
"Gloriana." Elizabeth received him with the flatt"l'ing
welcome she always accordc,l to distinguished strangers,
a!ld placed him in charge of the splendid Leicester. He
Yisited all the England of the sixteenth century worth
showing, and especially her two tJni•·crsitics, but was
sorely disappointed at not finding the famous Dr. Dee at
Oxford. "I would not h.l•·e come hither," he said to the
Earl, " had I wot that Dee wt~.s not here." Leicester un-
dertook to introduce him to the lcJ.rned philosopher on
their return to London, and ~;o soothed his discontent.
A few days afterwards the P,•le and Leicester were w~it­
ing in the ante-chamber at Whitehall lor an audieuce of
the Queen, when Dr. Dee arrived. Leicester embraced
the opportunity, and introduced him to Alb('rt La.~ki.
The interview between two geni:\1 spirits was interesting,
and led to frequent visits from Laski to Dee's bouse at
i\llorthke. Kelly soon perceived what a P<lctt•!us t-his
Pole would prove, a:-~d as he was imf:\ued with all the ex-
travagant superstitions of the age relative to the elixir
and the Philosopher's Stone, it was e.lsy e110ugh to play
upon his imagination, and entangle him in the meshes of
an inextricable deception. Dee, in want of money to
prosecute his splendid chimera~. and influenced by Kelly's
artful suggestions, lent himself in some me<J.sure to the
fraud, and speed1ly the ",~treat crystalling globe" began
to reveal hints and predictions which inflamed the ardent
hncy of the ·• noble Pl)lor.ian." But Keily imposed upon
Dec as well as upon Laski. He appears to have formed
some wild but magnificent projects for the reconstruction
of Europe, to be effcetcrl through the agency of the Pole,
and thenceforth the spirits could converse upon nothing
but hazy politics.
On a careful perusal or Dec's Diary, it is impossible to
come to a!ly other coaclusiun than that he was imposed
upon by Kelly, and accepted his re,·elations as the actual
utterances of the spirit5 ; and it seems probable that the
clever, plastic, slippery Kelly not <.nly knew something of
the optical delusions then pr::1cti~ed by the pretended necro-
m!lnccrs, b'ut possessed Cl)nsilleral..le ventrilogui~l powers,
which largely assisted in his nefarious deceptions
Kelly had undoubtedly conceived some extravagant
notions of a vast European monarchy, in which Laski was
to play the part of a floi fai~ztant and he himself of a il•laire
du Palais. To this point all the spiritual revelations now
tended, and they were managed, it must be owned, with
consummate skill. Laski was proved, by the agency of
M1.dinie, to be descended from the Anglo-Norman family
of the Lacies. Then an angel .M.med Murifrc, who was
clothed like a husbandmar:, pointed out Laski as destined
to effect the regeneration of the world.
But it did not answer Kelly's purposes to bring matters
too suddenly to a conclusion, and with the view of showing
the extreme value of his services, he ren(:wcd his complaints
upon the wickedness or dealing with spirits, and his fear
of the perilous enterprises they might enjoin. He threat-
e!led, moreover, to abandon his task, a threat which com-
pletely perturbed the equanimity of Dr. Dee. \\'here
indeed, could he hope to meet with another skryer of such
infinite ability ? Once when Kelly expressed hts desire of
riding fro;n :Vlortlake to Islington on some pretended busi-
ness. the doctor grc\1( afra!d th.tt 1t was only an excuse to
coYer his absolute evasion. ·• Whereupon," says the doctor,
" I a~l;:ed him why he so htstcd to ride thither, and I said
if it were to ride to :llr. HMry Lee I would go thither, and
to be <Lcquainted with him, seeing now I had so good leisure,
being eased of the book writin~. Then he said that one
told him the other day that the duke (Laski) did but flatter
him, and told him other tbin~s both against the dulce and
me. I a:~swered f<>r the dulce and myself, and also said
that if the forty pounds annuity which i\lr. Lee did offer
him W;tS the chief cause of his mind setting that way (con-
trary to many of his former promises to me). that then I
would assure him of f1fty po~nds yearly, ant.! would do
my best, by following of my !>uit, to bring it to pass as soon
as 1 possibly could ; and thereupon did make him promise
upon the Bible.
•· Then Edward Kelly :li\'ain upon the same Bible did
swc.!r unto rne consta:~t fnendship, and never to forsake
me ; and moreover s~id that unless this had so fallen about
he would have gune beyond the seas, taking ship at ~ew­
castle within eight days next.
·• And so we plight our !::lith each to the other, taking
each other by the hand, upon these points of b~otherly
and friendly fidelity during life, which covenant I beseech
God to turn to his honour, glory, and service, and the corn-
fort of our brethren (his children) here on earth."
Kelly now returned to his crystal and his visions, and
Laski was soon pc~suaded that he was destined by the
spirit-s to achieve great victories over the Saracens, and
win enduring glory. nut for this purpose it was needful
he should return tCI Poland, and to Poland the poor dupe
went, takin~ with him the learned Dr. Dee, the invaluable
Edward Kelly. and their wives and families. The spirits
continued to respond to their illquirics even while at sea,
and so they landed at the Brill on the 3oth of July 1583,
and traversed Holland and Friesland to the opulent free
town o! Lubeck. There they lived sumptuously for a few
weeks, and ,~; th recruited strength set out for Poland.
On Christmas Day they arrived at Stettin, where they
remcined till the middle of january 1584. They gained
La~co, the Pole's principal estate, early in February. Im-
mediately the grand work commenced for the transmu-
tation of iron into gold, bo"Jndless wealth being obv;ously
needful for so grand an enterprise as the regeneration of
Europe. Laski liberally supplied them with means, but
the alchyrnists always failed on the very threshold of suc-
cess. Day by day the prince's trees melted away iu the
deceptive crucible ; he mortgaged his estates, be sold
them, but the hungry furnace continued to cry for ·• More!
more!" It soon became apparent to the philosopher's
that Laski's fortune was nearly exhausted. l\ladinie,
Uriel, and their comrades made the same discovery at the
same time, and, moreover, began to doubt whether Laski,
after all, was the great regenerator intended to revolu-
tionize Europe. The whole party Jived at Cracow from
March 1584 until the end of July, and made daily appeals
to the spirits in reference to the Polish prince. They grew
more and more discouraging in their replies, and as Laski
began slowly to aW2.kc to the conviction that he bad been
a monstrous dupe, in order to rid himself of the burthen,
he proposed to furnish them with sufficient funds for a
journey to Prague, and letters of introduction to the Em-
peror Rudolph. At this very. moment the spirits discov-
ered th<~t it was necessary D11e should bear a d1vine message
to the Emperor, and La~ld's proposal was gladly accepted.
At Prague the two philosophers were ,~·ell received by
the Emperor. They found him very willing to believe
in the existence of the famous stone, very cou.rteous to
Dee as a man of European celebrity, but very suspicious
of the astute and plausible Kelly. They remained some
Dee, ' ohn 117
months l'.t Prague, lidng llpon the funds which Laski had
supplied, and cherishing hopes of being attached to the
imperial service. At lao;t the Papal Nuncio complained
to the countenance afforded to heretical magicians, and
the Emperor ordered them to quit his dominions within
four-and-twenty hours. They precipitately complied,
and by so doing escaped a prison or the stake, to which
the Nuncio had received orders from Rome to consign
them (~lay 1586). ·
They now proceeded to Erfurdt, ar.d from thel!ce to
Cassel, but meeting with a cold reception, made thei:- way
once more to Cracow. Here they e:~rned a scanty living
by telling fortunes and casting nativities; enduring the
pl!.ngs of penury with an almost heroic composure, for they,
the pretended possessors of the Philosopher's Stone, durst
not reveal their indigence to the world, if they would not
expose themselves to universal ridicule. After a while,
they found a new dupe in Stephen, king of Poland, to whom
Kelly's spirits predicted that the Emperor Rudolph would
shortly be assassinated, and that the Germans would elect
him to the Imperial throne. But he in his turn grew weary
of the ceaseless demands for pecuniary supplies. Then
arose a new disciple in the person of Count Rosenberg, a
nobleman of large estates at Trebona, in Bohe~a. At
his castle they remained for upwards of two years, eagerly
pursuing their alchemical studies, but never approaching
any nearer to the desired result.
Dee's enthusiasm and credulity had degraded him into
the tool and slave of Kelly; but the latter was neverthe-
less very wroth at the superior respect which Dee, as really
a man of surprising scholarship and considerable ability,
enjoyed. Frequent quarrels broke out between them,
aggravated by the crimin::~l passion which Kelly had con-
ceived for the doctor's young and handsome wife, and
which he had determined to gratify. He matured l'.t
length an artful plan to obtain the fulfilment of his wishes.
Knowing Dee's entire dependence upon him as a skf'yer,
he Sljddenly announced hls intention of resigning that
honoured nnd honourable office, and only consented to
remain on the doctor's urgent entreaties. That day (April
18, 1587) they consulted the spirits. Kelly profes~ed to
be shocked at the revelation they ml'.de, and refused to
repeat it. Dee's curiosity was aroused, and he ir.si<;ted
upon hearil!g it, but was exceedingly discomposed when
he found that the spirits enjoined the two philosophers
to have their wives in common. Kelly expressed his own
abhorre:'lce of the doctrine, and when the spirits repeated
it, with a mixture of socialistic extravagance to the effect
that sin was only relative, fl.nd could not be sinful if ordered
by God, protested they must bespirits of evil, not of good,-
once more resigned Ius post as skryer,-ar.d left the Castle.
Dee now attempted to convert his son Arthur into a
medium, but the lad had neither the invention, the faith,
nor the deceptive powers for such an office, :md the phil-
osopher, deprived of those conferences with the other world
which he had so long enjoyed, began to lament the abser.ce
of his old confederate. At this juncture Kelly suddenly
returned. Again he consulted the crystal, and again was
ordered to practise the socialistic rule of all things in com-
mon. Dee was too delighted at his return to oppose any
longer the will of the spirits. The two wh·es resisted the
arrangement for some time, but finally yielded to what
was represented to be the will of Heaven, and Dee notes
in hi~ Diary that ·• on Sunday the 3rd of May, anno 1587
(by the new account), I, john Dee, Edward Kelly, and
our two wives covenanted with God, and subscribed the
same for indissoluble and inviolable unities, ch:uity, and
friendship keeping, betwee:1 us four, and all things between
us to be commO:'l, as God by sundry means willed us to
do."
Dee, John
The akhymists now resumed their pursuits with eager-
ness; but di~j:ord soon crept into this happy family of
four. The wives, never very well content with the social-
istic theory, quarrelled violently; the husbands began
to be pinched for want of mc::\n'l ; and Dee turned his eyes
towards England as a pl~santer asylum than the castle
of Trebona was likely to prove for his old age. He obtained
permission from Queen Elizabeth to return, and separated
finally from Kelly. The latter, who had been knighted
at Prague, took with him an elixir found at Glastonbury
Abbey, and ventured to proceed to the Bohemian capitl'.l.
lie wa~ immediately arre!'ted by order of the Emperor,
and flung into prison. Obtaining his release after some
months' imprisonment, be wandered over Germany, tell-
ing fortunes, and angling for d~pes v.itl1 the customary
magical baits, but never getting a whit nearer that enjoy-
ment of boundless resources which the possession of the
Philosopher's Stone should haYe ensured him. Arrested
a second time as a heretic and a sorcerer, and apprehending
perpetual imprisonment, he endeavoured to escape, but
fell from the dungeon-wall, and broke two of his ribs and
both of his legs. He expued of the injuries he had received
in February T593·
Dr. Dee set out from Trcbona v.ith a splendid train, the
expenses of his journey ?..pparently being defrayed by the
generous Bohemian noble. Three waggons carried his
baggage ; three coaches co11veyed himself, his family,
and servants. A guard of twenty-four soldiers escorted
him; each Cl'.rri?.ge was drawn by four horses. In Eng-
land he was well received by the Queen, as far as courteous
phrases went, and settling him~elf 2-t Mortlake, he re-
sumed his chemical studies, l'.nd his pursuit of the Phil-
osopher's Stone. But nothing prospered with the un-
fortunate enthusiast. He employed two shryers-at first
a rogue, named Bartholomew, ?..l!d aften,·ards a charlatan
named Heckman-but neither could discover anything
satisfactory in the "great crystalline globe." He grew
poorer and poorer ; he sank into absolute indigence; he
wearied the Queen w1tlt ceaseless importunities; and at
length obtained a small appointment as Chancellor of St.
Paul's Cathedral, which in 1595 he exchanged for the war-
denship of :0.1a!:!chester College. He performed the duties
of this position ur.til age and a failing intellect compelled
him to resign it about r6o2 or 16o3.
He then retired to his old house at Mortlake, where he
practised as a common fortune·teller, gaining little in
return but the unenviable reputation of a wizard, "a con-
juror, a caller, or invocator of devils." On the 5th of June
1604, he presented a.petition to James the First, imploring
his protection against such injurious calumnies, an<i de-
claring that nor.e of all the great number pi •· the very
strarrge and frivolous fables or histories reported and told
of him las to have been of his doing) were true."
Dee is an exceptionally interesting figure, l'.nd he must
have been a man of rare intellectual activity. He made
calcul?.tions to facilitate the adoption in En~land of the
Gregorian calendar ; and he VIrtually anticipated the
Historical 1\'ia.nuscripts Commission, addressing to the
crown a petition wherein he wrote on the desirability of
carefully preserving the old, unpllblished records of Eng-
land's p?.st, many of which documents were at this period
domiciled in the archives of monasteries. Moreover he
was a voluminous writer on science, and, though lack cf
space makes it impossible to give a full list of his works
here, it certainly b~hoYes to mention the following: Mo11as

De Lisle~ (circa. 1710). French Alchemist. A considerable
amount of m:.tter concerning this French alchemist is
contained in Langlct de Fresnoy's invaluable book, His-
toire de Ia Philosophie Hermetique, while Figuier \\Tites at
some length on the subject; but neither of these writers
furnishes de Lisle's Christian name, and neither gives the
exact date of his birth. The place where the event oc-
curred is likewise unknown, although it is commonly held
that the alchemist was a Provenyal; while his J?Osition
in the social hierarchy is likewise a matter of conJecture.
the tradition that he sprang- from humble pe~sant stock
being practically vitiated by the particrtle in his name.
True that this is usually spclt Delisle, but one may be
fairly cert."\in that that is a mere perversion, and that
originally the two syllables were wntten separately.
De Lisle is known to have been active during the first
decade of the eighteenth century, so it may be assume<.!
that he was born towards the close of le grand siecle ; while
it would seem that, at an e:uly age. he entered the service
of a scientist whose name is unrecorded, but who is sup-
posed to have been a pupil of Lasearis. This nameless
scientist. it appears, got into trouble of some sort, the
likelihood being that he wJ.s persecuted on account of his
hermetic predilections ; and accordmgly be left Provence
and set out for Switzerland, taking \dth him his young
henchman, de Lisle. Eu route the latter murdered his
patron aml employer, thereafter appropriating all his al-
chemistic property, notably some precious transmuting
powdc: ; and then, about the ye:\-;- 1708, he returned to
his native France, where he soon attracted attention by
changing masses of lead and iron into sih·er and gold.
~oble and influential people now be~an to court his society
and his scientific services, and l>ebmes he found himself
safely and comfortably housed in the castle of La Palud,
where he received many visitors from day to day, <!emon-
strating his skill before them. Anon, however, he grew
weary of this life; and, having contracted a liaison \\ith
a :'-fadame Aloys, he commenced wandering with her from
place to place. a son being eventually born to the pair. At
this time Madame Alnys' husband was still living, but that
did not prevent de Lisle from continuing to elicit patronage
and favour from the rich and great, and in 17 ro, at the
Chateau de St. Auban, he performed a curious experiment
in the presence of one St. }.Iaurice, then president of the
royal mint. Going into the grounds of the chdteaa one
evening, de Lisle showed St..i\Iaurice a basket sunk in the
ground, and bade him !>ring it into the salte-d-manger
where it was duly opened, its contents transpiring to be
merely some earth of a blackish hue. ~o very precious
material ! thought St. :Maurice, accustomed to handling
ingots and nuggets ; but de Lisle, after distilling a yellow
liquid from the earth, projected this ou hot quicksilver,
and speedily produced in fusion three ounces of gold, while
subsequently he succeeded in concocting a tolerable quan-
tity of silver. Some of the gold was afterwards sent to
Paris, where it was put through a refining process, and
three. me<!al~ were struck from it, one of which. bea..ring
the mscoption Aurum Arte Factum, \'laS deposited in
the cabinet of his most Christian majesty. Thereupon
de Lisle was invited to come to Paris himself, and visit the
conrt: but be declined the offer, giving as his reason that
the southern climate he chieRy lived in was necessary to
the success of his experiments, the preparations he worked
with being purely vegetable. The probability is that,
having been signally triumphant in duping his clientele
so far, he felt the advisability of refraining from endeavours
which might prove futile, and vitiate his reputation.
\'\'c hear nothing of de Lisle later than 1760, so presum-
ably he died about that time; but his son by Madame
Aloys seems to have inherited some part of his father's
predilections, together with a fair quota of his skill. Wan-
dering for many y~ars through Italy and Germany, he
affected transmutatiOns successfully before various petty
nobles; while at Vienna he succeeded in bringing himself
under the notice of the Due de Richelieu, who was acting
then as French ambassador to the Viennese court, and
Richelieu afterwards assured the Abbe Langlet that be
not only saw the operation of gold-making performed, but
did it himself by carrying out instructions given him by
Aloys. The latter gradually acquired great wealth, but,
falling under suspicion, he was imprisoned for a space at
1\Iarseilles, whence he ultimately escaped to Brussels.
Here he continued, not altogether unsuccessfully, t.o en-
gage in alchemy; while here too he became acquainted
\'lith Percell, the brother of Langlet du Fresnoy, to whom
he is supposed to have confided some valuable scientific
secrets. Eventually, however, the mysterious death of
one Grefier, known to have been working in Aloys' lab-
oratory, made the Brussels authorities suspicious about
the latter's character, so he left the town stealthily, never
to be heard of again.

subject-such as \Vierus, Delancrc, Lcloyer-arc some-
times called demonographers.
Demonology : That branch of magic which deals with male-
volent spirits. In religio11s science it has come to indicate
knowledge regardin~ supernaturnI beings who are not
deities. But, it is 10 regard to its magical significance
onJv that it falls to be de<l.ll wilh here. The Greek term
Dafmon, ori~inally indicated "genius" or ·• spirit," but
in England 1t has come to mean a being actively male-
volent. Ancient DtiiiO/IOiogy will be found dealt with in
the articles Egypt, Semites. Genius and Devil-Worship.
and savage demouolOKY under the heacis of the various
countries and races where it had its origin. According to
1\lichael Psellus, demons are divided into six great bodies.
First, the demons of fire. Second, those of the air. Third,
those of the earth. The fourth inhabit the waters and
rivers, and cause tempests and floods; the fifth are sub-
terranean, who prepare earthquakes and excite volcanic
eruptions. The sixth, are shadows, something of the
nature of ghosts. St. Augu~tine comprehends all demons
under the l:1.st ca.tegory. This classification of Psellus is
not unlike that system of the middle ages, which divined
all spirits into those belonging to the four elements, fire,
air, earth, and water, or salamanders, sylphs, undines,
and gnomes.
The medi.eval idea of demons was, of course, in a direct
Demonology 119
line from the ancient Christian and Gnostic supposition.
The Gnostics, of early Christian times, in imitation of a
classification o£ the different orders of spirits by Plato,
had attempted a similar arrangement with•respect to an
hierarchy of angels, the gradation of which stood as fol-
lows :-The first and highest order was named seraphim, the
second cherubim, the third was the order of thrones, the
fourth of dominions, the fifth of virtues, the sixth of powers,
the seventh of principalities, the eighth of archangels,
the ninth, and lowest, of angels. This classification was,
in a pointed manner, censured by the apostles, yet still,
strange to say, it almost outlived the pneumatologists
of the middle ages. These schoolmen, in refeTence to the
account that Lucifer rebelled against heaven, and that
Michael, the archangel, warred against him, long agitated
the momentous question : " What orders of angels fell
on this occasion ? " At length, it became the prevailing
opinion that Lucifer was of the order of Seraplum. It
was also proved after infinite research, that Agares, Belial,
and Barbatos, each of them deposed angels of great rank,
bad been of the order of virtues; that Bileth, Focalor,
and Pha::nix, had been of the order of thrones : that
Goap had been of the order of powers, and that Purson
had been both of t he order of virtues and of thrones : and
Murmur, of thrones and of angels. The pretensions of
many other noble devils were likewise canvassed, and, in
-equally satisfactory manner, determined. Afterwards, it
became an object of enquiry to learn : " How many fallen
angels had been engaged 10 the contest ? '· This was a
question of vital importance, which gave ri-;e to the most
laborious research, and to a variety of discordant opinions.
It was next agitated : " Where the battle was fought-
in the inferior heaven, in the highest region of t he air, in
the firmament, or in Paradise? " " How lor.g it lasted ?-
whether during one second, or moment of time (punctum
lcmporis), two, three, or four seconds ? " These are queries
of \'cry difficult solution, but the notion which ultimately
prevailed was, that the engagement was concluded in
exactly three seconds from the date of its commencement ;
and that while Lucifer, with a number of his followers,
fell into hell, the rest were left in the air to tempt man. A
-still ncv.•er question rose out of all these investigations:
·• Whether more angels fell with Lucifer, or remain in
beaven v.<ith Michael ? " Learned clerks, however, were
inclinEi'd to think that the rebel chief had been beaten by a
~uperior force, and that, consequently, devil!> of darkness
were feweT in number than angels of light.
These discussions which, during the number of succ~sive
centuries interested the whole of Christendom, too fre-
quently exercised the talents of the most erudite persons
in Europe. The last object of demonologists was to
collect, in some degree of order, Lucifer's routed forces,
and to reorganise them under a decided form of subordina-
tion or government. Hence, extensiYe districts were
given to certain chiefs who fought under t his general.
There was Zimimar, •· the lordly monarch of the north,"
a s Shakespeare styles him, who had his distinct province
of devilS ; there was Corson, the King of the South ;
Amaymon, the King of the East ; and Goap, the Prince
of the West. These sovereigns had many noble spirits
subordinate to them, whose various ranks were settled
wit h aU the preciseness of heraldic distinction : there were
Devil Dukes, Devil i\larquises, Devil Counts,· Devil Earls,
Devil Knights, Devil Presidents, and Devil Prelates. The
a rmed force under Lucifer seems to have comprised nearly
·twenty-four hundred legions, of which each demon of rank
~omrnanded a certain number. Thus, Beleth, whom· Scott
has described as " a great king and terrible, riding on a
pale horse, before whom go trumpets and all melodious
music," commanded eighty-five legions: Agares, the first
Demonology
duke under the power of the East, commanded thirty-one
legions ; Leraie, a great marquis, thirty legions ; Morax,
a great earl and a president, thirty-six legions: Furcas, a'.
knight, twenty legions ; and, after the same manner, the
forces of the other devil chieftains were enumerated.
Such were the notions once entertained regarding the
history, nature, and ranks of devils. Our next object "''ill
be to show that, with respect to their strange and hideous
forms the apparitions connected \\<itb the popular belief
on this subject, \~eTe derived from the descriptive writings
of such demonologists, as either maintained that demons
poss~sed a decided corporeal form, and were mortal, or
that, like :'vlilton's spirits, they could assume any sex, and
take any shape they chose.
When, in the middle ages, conjuration was regularly
practised in Europe, devils of rank were supposed to appear
ur.der decided forms, by which they were as well recognised·
as the head of any ancient family would be by his crest
and armorial bearings. Along with their names and
characters were registered such shapes as they were
accustomed to adopt. A devil would appear, either like
an angel seated in a fiery chariot, or riding on an infernal
dragon, and carrying in his right hand a viper; or assum-
ing a lion's head, a goose's feet, and a bare's tail; or putting
on a raven's head, and mounted on a strong wolf. Other
forms made usc of by demons were those of a fierce warrior,
or of an old man riding upon a crocodile with a hawk in
his hand. A human figure would arise having the wings
of a griffin; or sporting three heads, two of t hem being
like those of a toad and of a cat : or defended with huge
teeth and horns, and armed with a sword ; or displaying
a dog's teeth and a lar~e raven's head: or mounted upon
a pale horse, and exhib1ting a serpent's tail ; or gloriously
crowned, and riding Upon a dromedary ; or presenting the
face of a lion ; or bestriding a bear, and grasping a viper.
There are also such shapes as those of an archer, or of a
Zenophilus. A demoniacal king would ride upon a pale
horse : or would assume a leopard's face and griffin's
'1\'ings; or put on the three heads of a bull, of a man, and
a ram, with a serpent's tail, and the feet of a goose : and,
in this attire, bestride a dragon, and bear in his hand a
lance and a flag : or, instead of being thus employed, goad
the flanks of a furious bear, ar.d carry in his fist a hawk.
Other forms were those of a goodly knight ; or of one who
bore lance, ensigns, and even a sceptre; or of a soldier ,
either riding on a black horse, and surrounded by a flame
of fire, or wearing on his head a duke's crown, and mounted
on a crocodile or assuming a lion's face, and, with fiery eyes,
spurring on a gigantic charger: or, with the same frightful
aspect, appearing in all the pomp of family distinction, on
a pale horse ; or clad from head to foot in crimson raiment,
wearing on his bold front a crown, and sallying along on a
red steed. Some infernal duke would appear in his proper
character, quietly seated on :\ griffin; another spirit of a
similar rank would display the three heads of a serpent,
a man, and a cat; he would also bestride a viper, and
carry in his hand a firebrand. Another of the same type
would appear like a duchess, encircled with a fiery :zone,
and mounted on a camel ; a fourth, would wear the aspect
of a boy, and amuse himself on the back of a two-headed
dragon. A few spirits, however, would be content with
t he simple garbs of a horse, a leopard, a lion, an unicorn, a
night raven, a stork, a peacock, or a dromedary, the latter
animal speaking fluently the Egyptian language. Others
would assume the more complex forms of a lion or of a
dog, with a griffin's wings attached to each of their shoulders,
or of a bull equally well gifted : or of the same animal,
distinguished by the singular feature of a · man's face;
or of a crow clothed with human flesh ; or of a hart \\-'ith
a fiery tail. To certain other noble devils were assigned
Demonology 120 Deoca
such !'hapes as those o~ ?. dragon "·ith ti1rce heads, one of
these being human; of a wolf v;ith a serpent's tail, breath-
ing forth flames of tire ; o! a she-wol! exhibiting the same
caudal appendage together with griffin's wings, and
ejecting from her mouth hidcou~ matter. A lion would
appear, either with the head of a branded thief, or astride
upon a black horse, and pla};ng with a viper, or adorned
with the tail of a snake, and grasping in his pa"-s two
hissing serpents.
These were the \'aried shapes assumed by devils of rank.
" It would, therefore," says Hibbert, " betray too much
of the aristocratical spirit to omit noticing the forms which
the lower orders of such beings displayed. In an ancient
Latin poem, describing the lament.'\ble vision of a de,·oted
hermit, and supposed to have been written by St. Bernard
in the year rzJ8, those spirits, who had no more important
business upon earth than to carry away condemned souls,
were described as blacker than pitch; as having teeth
bke lions, nails on thcir fingers like those of a wild-boar,
on their fore-head horns, through the extremities of which
poison was emitted, having wide cars flowing with cor-
ruption, and discharging serpents from their nostrils.
The devout writer of thr.se verses has even accompanied
them from drawings, in which the addition of the cloven
feet is not omitted. But this appcnda~e. as Sir Thomas
Brown has learnedly proved, is a mistake, which has arisen
from the devil frequently appearing to the Je,•:s in the
shape of a rough and hairy goat, this animal being the
emblem of sin-offcrin~."
It is worthy of further remark, thi\t the form of the
demons described by St. Bernard difiers little from that
which is no less carefully pourtrayed by Heginald Scot,
three hundred and fifty years later, and, pcrh:J.ps, by the
dernonologists of the present day. .. In our chilC:hood,"
says he, .. our mother's maids h::.ve so terrified u~ with an
ouglie divell ha\;ng horns on his he.'ld, tier in his mouth,
and a tail on his breech, eics like a bason, fangs like a dog,
clawes like a beare, a o;kin hke a ni~er, and a vo!ce like a
roaring Lion-whereby we start and arc afraid when we
hear o"e cry bough."
Wit the view of illustr.:.tin,:: other accounts or appari-
tions, we must advert to the doctrines o! dcmo;ro/,·gy which
were once taught. Although the leadin~ tenets of this
occu It science may be tracerl to the Jews and early Christ-
ians, yet they were matured by our early communication
with the :\Ioors of Spain, who were the chief philosophers of
the dark ages, and between whom and the natives of France
and Italy much communication. subsisted. Toledo,
Se.,;ne, and Salamanca, became the great schools of magic.
At the latter city, prelections on the black art were, from
a consistent regard to the solemnity of the subject,
delivered within the walls of a vast and gloomy cavern.
The schoolmen taught that all knowledge and power might
be obtained from the assistance of the fallen angels. They
were skilled i.n the abstract sciences, in the knowledge of
precious stones, in alchemy, in the various languages of
mankind and of the lower animals, in the belles lettres, in
moral philosophy, pneumatology, divinity, magic, history,
and prophecy. 'fhcy could control the winds, the waters,
and the influence of the stars ; they could raise earth·
quakes, induce diseases, or cure them, accomplish all vaster
mechanical undertakings, anet release souls out of purgatory.
They could influence the passions of the mind, procure the
reconcilation of friends or foes, engender mutual discords,
induce mania and melancholy, or direct the force and
objects of the sexual affections. According to Wierus,
demons are divided into a great many cla~es. and into
regular kingdoms and principalities, n<>bles and com-
moners. Satan is by no means the great sovereign of this
monarchy, but his place is taken by Beelzebub. Satan is
allude<! to by Wierus as a dethr011Cd monarch, and Chief
of the Opposition ; Moloch, Chief of the Army ; and Pluto,
Prince of Fire ; and Leonard, Grand ~laster of the Sphere.
The ma~ters of these infernal courts are, Adramelcch,
Grand Chancellor ; Astaroth, Grand Trea~urer; and
Nergal, Chief of the Secret Police ; and Baal, Chief of the
Satanic Army. Acc<>rding to this authority, each state
in Europe has also its infernal ambassadors. Belphegor
is thus acc~edited to Fr:\nce, ::\Iammon to England, Belial
to Turkey, Himmon to Russia, Thamuz to Spain, Hutjin
to Italy, and ::\Iartinct to Switzerland. Berbignicr, writing
in 18:!1, has given a sketch of the Infernal Court. He says:
" This court hM representatives on earth. These manda-
tories are innumerable. I give nomenclature and degree
of power of each : Moreau, magician and sorcerer of Paris,
represents Beelzebub; Pinel, a doctor of Salpetriere,
represents Satan ; Bougt>, represents Pluto ; ~ichola.o;, a
doctor of Avigum, represents Moloch; and so on. ·· Al-
together," says Wierns, " there are in the infernal rerrions
6666 legions, each composed o! the same number of devils."
Demonology and Witchcraft by Sir Walter Scott : This work
occupies a curious and pathetic place in Sir Walter Scott's
vast literary output. Four years subsequent to his finan-
cial debacle, in r826, the author sustained a mild apopl~­
tic shock, and it was shmtly after this that John l\lurray,
who wa.~ then issuing a series known as ·· The Family
Librarv," a~ked Sir \\'alter to contribute thereto a volume
on de,;wnology. Consent was given readily, but, as an
entry in Scott's journal makes manifest, he did not care
greatly for the work, and rt>.ally eng0\ge1l in it just because
he was still i11 the throes of writing off his debts, and had
to accept evl.'ry commi~siou which was offered him. In
!.hort, the hook was begun from a purely commercial
motive, and was compu;;ed when the writer's mental
faculties were perforce sluggish, the nMural re!.ult being
that it is infiHitcly inferior to his other writings. But
despite its inferiority herein, Sir \\'alter's volume has its
interest for students of occultism. The \\Titer is lame
enoilgh in what might be called the speculative paT'ts of his
book-those pat;es, for instance, in which he tries labor-
iously to acco:mt !or the prevalence in the middle-ages of
belief in witchcr.!.ft and the hke-but his wonderful and
well-stored m<'mory stood him in ~ood stead \\~hen writing
those passages concerned p;ucly wtth facts, and thus there
is considerable VO\luc in his account of demonolo;:y in France
and in Sweden, and in all that he says about joan of Arc.
i\Ioreo,·er, his intimate knowledge of early Scottish litera-
ture gives a singular importance to all those of his clJ.apters
which are concerned v:ith his native land, while it is interest-
'ing to find that here and there, he offers something of a
sidelight on his own immortal novels, i\S for example, when
he treats of those spectres which he had dealt with prev-
iou!;ly in Woodstock.
Demonomancy: Divination by means of demons. This
divination takes place by the oracles they make, or by the
answers they gh·c to those who evoke them.
DemonomanJa : The mania of those who believe all that
is told concerning demons and sorcerers, such as Bodin,
Delancre, Lelover, and others. Bodin's work is entitled
DemoiiOHIQ11ia of the Sor,crers, but in this case it signifies
devilry.
De Morgan, Mrs. : The author of a mystico·spiritual work
entitled From ll-laller to SpiYit, pubhshed in r86J. 1\frs.
de Morgan, whose interest in spirih>alism was awakened
at the seances o! Mrs. Hayden, was the wife of Professor
de :'llorgan, who himself offered emphatic testimony to
the genuineness of Mrs. Harden's mediumship.
Deoca, or The Woman of the South: A Princess of
:'llun.ster, who is mentioned in Irish medieval legend. It
is said that she was betrothed to Lairgnan, and asked of
Dermot 121 Devas
him as a marria)!e gift the children of Lir, who had been
magically changPd by their stepmother into four wonderful
singing swans. The hermit who lool;ed after them refused
to give them to Lairgnan, who then sei:ted them. When
brought into the presence of Deoca they were transformed
into their human form-\\;thered, white-haired, miserable
beings. The hermit baptised them before they died,
and sorrowed for them so much that he himself was laid
in tht"ir g-rave.
Dermot of the Love-spot : The typical lover of Irish legend,
and the hero of the myth of Dermot and Crania. It ·,o.•as
in thls wise that he got the love-spot. One night he and
three comnanions entered a hut for a night's shelter, in
which dwelt an old man, a young girl (Youth), a wether
(the World) and a cat (De;.th). During the night the
girl put the love-spot on Dermot's forehead, :mel hence-
forth, it is said, no woman could sec him without loving
him. He came to be loved by Crania, the betrothed of
Finn, who forced him to run away with her. They were
pursued all over Ireland, but after sixteen years of out-
lawry, Dermot wa~ allowed to return to his patrimony. He
was killed by the Doar of Uen, Bulben, (q.v.) an enchanted
animal, who had been his step-brother. His body was
borne away on a gilded bier by the People of Dana, and
was given a soul by Angus Og, the Irish God of Love, that
he might return each day and talk with him. Dermot
was of the type of sol.\r hero; and the bier on which his
body was borne away is, of course, the sunset.
Dervishes : A sect of ;llohammedan priests. In some cases
they exercise a semi-esoteric doctrine. Their various
"paths" or systems are of great antiquity, and probably
are derived from the ancient rites of Persia and Egypt,
bearing also a strong resemblance to Magism. Taking
the Bektash as typical of all, we find tbat in the fifteenth
century Bektas/; of Bokhara received his mantle from
Ahmed Yesevee, who claimed descent from the father-
in-law of )lohammed. He established a " path," con-
sisting r.ominally of seven degrees, only four of which,
however, are essential. These aim at the establishment
of an affinity between the aspirant and the Sheik, from
whom he is led through the spirit of the founder, and that of
the Prophet to All~h. The initiatory ceremony provides
a severe test. The aspirant i~ tried for a year with
false secrets, and his time of probation ha,·ing expired,
a lamb is slain, from the carcass of which a cord is made
for his neck and a girdle of initiation for his loins. Two
armed attendants then lead him into a square chamber,
where he is presented to the Sheik as " a slave who desires
to know truth." He is then placed before a stone altar,
on which are twelve escallops. The Sheik, who is at-
tended by eleven others, grips the hand of the aspirant
in a. peculiar way, and administers the oath of the Order,
in which the neophyte promises to be poor, chaste and
obedient. J Ie is then informed that the penalty of be-
traying the Order is death. He then says : ''Mohammed
is my guide, Ali is my director," and is asked by the Sheik,
" Do you accept me as your guide ? " The reply being
made in the affirmative, the Sheik says: " Then I accept
you as my son." He is then invested with a girdle on
which are three knots, and receives an alabaster stone
as a token. The sign of recognition is the same as that
in the first degree of masonry. Amongst their important
symbols are the double triangles and two triangles joined
at the apex. One of their maxims is that •• the man must
die that the saint must be born." As a jewel they make
u~e of a small marble cube with red spots, to typify the
blood of the martyred Ali. These dervish sects are by
no means popular with the orthodox Mussulmans, as they
d evote themselves entirely to the well-being of their order
rather than to Mohammedanism.
. A notable exercise indulged in by se,·eral Dervish sects,
IS that of gyr?..tion in circles for extended periocls of time,
or prolonged dancing. The object of this is obscure, some
authorities contending that it is engaged in to bring about
a condition of ecstasy, whilst others see in it a planetary
or astronomic significance.
D'Eslon: (See Hypnotism.\
Desmond, Gerald, sixteenth earl of Desmo11d, who was k11lt'd
in 1583, had some repute :IS a magician, and was known
as the " Great Earl." 1\lany curious stories are current
cohcerning him. He dwelt in his castle on a small island
in Lough Cur, and there, in time, he brought his young
bride, to whom he was so passionately attached that he
could deny her nothing. Seeking him one l'!ay in the
chamber where he worked his magic spells, she dcmr.nded
to know the secret of the Black Cat. In vain he told her
of the terrible things she must w1tncss ; she wot:ld not be
dissuaded. So he warned her solemnly th<>.t if she uttered
a word the castle would sink to the bottom of Lough Cur,
and set to work. Ter~ible indeed were the sights she
beheld, but she stood firm and uttered neither word nor
cry, until her husbanrl lav down on the floor and stretched
till he reached almcst fro·m end to end of the room. T hen
she utter.ed a wild shriek, and the castle sank instantly to
t11e bottom of Lough Cur, where it still remains. Once
in every seven y<!ars Desmond, mounted on a white horse,
rises from the water and rides round the Lough. His
horse is shod with silver shoes, and when these wear out
the spell \\;ll be broken, Desmond will return, and his vast
estates shall once more be restored to him.
D'Espagnet, Jean : A Hermetic philosopher who left h\'O
treatises Enchiridion Physic0 Reslitulm and Arcom!11l
Plzilosophia HernritacQJ which have also been claimed
as the works of one calling himself the "Chevalier Im-
perial." "The Secret of Hermetic Philosophy " em-
braces the practical side of the Maguum Opus and the
" Er.ch.iridion" trc.'\ts of the physical possibility of trans-
mutation. D'E.spagttet also \\Tote the preface to the
Tabfeaz-. de l' Jncor.slnnce des Demotrs by Pierre Delancre.
The .. Arcanum" is better known as the " Canons of Es-
pagnet " and has been claimed as a treatise on mystical
Alchemy. The Author states, however, that ·• the science
of producing N'ature's grand Secret is a perfect knowledge
of nature unh·ersallr and of Art, concerning the realm of
Metals ; the practice whereof i~ conversant in finding the
principles of Metals by analysis."
The authorities cited by Espagnct are those who like
Trevisan are known to l1ave de\'oted their lives to practical
Alchemy. Nevertheless, it may be granted that while
m uch of the matter treats of a pby!.ical object it may be
extended to the psychic side of Hermetic Art.
"Deuce Take You " : A vulgar saying which had its origin
in antiquity. The de11ce is practically synonymous with
the dev1l, the word being denved from Dusins, the ancient
name given by the Gauls to a sort of demon or devil.
Devas : In Theosophy, constitute one of the ranks or orders
of spirits who compose the hierarchy whkh rules the uni-
verse under the Deity. Their numbers are vast and their
functions are not all known to mankind, though generally
these functions may be said to be connected with the evo-
lution of systems and of life. Of Devas there are three
kinds-Bodiless Dcvas, Form Deva~ and Passion Devas.
Bodiless Dcvas belong to the higher mental world, their
bodies are composed of mental Elemental Essence, and
they belong to the first Elemental kingdom. Form Devas
belong to the lower mental world, and while their bodies
are composed also of mental Elemental Essence, they
belong to the second Elemental kingdom. Passion Devas
belong to the astral world and their bodies are composed
Devil 122
of a~tral Elemental Essence. Devas are creatures super-
latively great and superlatively glorious, of vast knowledge
and power, calm yet irresistible, and in appearance alto-
gether magnificent.
Devil: A name derived from the Greek Diabolos, "slanderer."
The name for the supreme spirit of evil, the enemy of God
and mJ.n. In primitive religious systems there is no con-
ception of evil, and the gods are neither good nor bad, as
we conceive thc~c terms, but may possess ·• good " and
" bad " attributes at one and the same time. Thus we
have very few traces of beings which are absolutely evil
in the older religions, and it may be broadly stated that
the conception of Satan as we have it to-day is 2lmost
purely Hebrew and Christian. In Egypt and Babylon,
figures like Apepi and Tiawatb, although clearly in the line
of evolution of a Satanic personality, arc by no means
rulers of the infernal regions. Again the Hades of the
Greeks is merell a ruler of the shades of the dead, and
not an enemy o Olympus or mankind. It is strange that
in Mexico, 1\·Iictlantecutli, lord of hell, is a much more
directly Satanic figure than any European or Asiatic ruler
of the re.'\lms of the dead. But in some mythologies, there
are frequent allusion<; to monsters who may quite easily
have coloured our conception of Satan. Such is the
Hindu serpent Ahi, and the Hebrew Leviathan, the prin-
ciple of Chaos. In the Teutonic mythology we have the
menacing ahape of Loki, originally a god of fire, but after-
wards the personification of evil. The conception of
Satan, too, appears to have some deeply-rooted connection
with the ancient serpent-worship, which seems to have
penetrated most oriental countries. Thus we find the
Tempter m the Old Testament in the guise of a serpent.
The serpent or dragon is being generally regarded as the
personification of night who swallows the sun and enve-
lopes the world in darkness.
The Hebrew conception of Satan it is thought, arose
in the post-exilic period, and exhibits traces of Babylonian
or Assyrian influence. It is not likely that before the
captivity any specific doctrine respecting evil spirits was
held by the Hebrews. Writing on this subject, J\'lr. F. T.
Hall in his book The Pedigree of the Devil says :-
"The term ·Satan' and 'Satans' which occur in the
Old Testament, arc certainly not applicable to the modern
conception of Satan as a spirit of evil ; although it is not
difficult to detect in the Old Hebrew mind a fruitful soil,
in which the idea, afterwards evolved, would readily take
root. The original ide<\ of a 'Satan ' is that of an 'adver-
sary,' or agent of 'opposition.' The angel which is said
to have withstood Balaam is in the same breath spoken
of as 'The angel of the Lord,' and a ' Satan.' \Vhen the
Philistines under Achish their king were about to commence
hostilities against the lsraelities under Saul and David
and his men were about to march with the Philistines;
the latter objected, lest, in the day of battle, David should
become a · Satan ' to them. by deserting to the enemy.
When David, in later life, was returning to Jerusalem, after
Absalom's rebellion and death; and his lately disaffected
subjects were, in turn, making their submission; amongst
them came the truculent Shimei: Abishai, David's nephew,
one of the fierce son.<> of Zeruiah, advised that Shimei
should be put to death: this grated upon David's feelings,
at a time when he was filled with exuberant joy at his own
restoration; and he rebuked Abishai as a 'Satan.' Again
Satan is said to have provoked David to number Israel,
.and at the same time, that ' the Lord moved David to
number Israel; ' a course strenuously opposed by joab,
another of the SOM of Zeruiah. Solomon in his message
to Hiram, king of Tyre, congratulated himself on having
no · Satans ' and that this peaceful immunity from dis-
~ord enabled him to build the Temple, which bad been
Devil
forbidden to his warlike father, David. This immunity
wao; not, however, lasting; for Hadad, the Edomite, and
Regon, of Zobah, became • Satans ' to Solomon, after his
profuse luxury had opened the way for curruption and
disaffection. In all these cases, the idea is simply identical
with the plain meaning of the word: a Satan is an opponent,
an adversary. In the elaborate curac embodied in the
109th Psalm, the writer speaks of his enemies as his' Satans'
and prays that the object of his anathema may have ' Satan'
standing at his right band. The Psalmist himself, in the
sequel, birly assumes the office of his enemy's ' Satan,'
by enumerating his crimes and failings, and exposing
them in their worst light. In the 7ISt Psalm, enemies
(v. zo) are identified with' Satans' or adversaries (v. 13).
·• The only other places in the Old Testament where the
word occurs, are in the Book of Job, and the prophecy
of Zechariah. In the Book of Job, Satan appears with
a distinct personality, and is associated v.-ith the sons of
God, and m attendance with them before the throne of
Jehovah. He is the cynical critic of Job's actions, and
in that character he accuses him of insincerity and instabi-
lity; and receives permission from Jehovah to test the
justice of this accusation, by afflicting Job in everything
he holds deaT. We have here the spy, the informer, the
public prosecutor, the executioner; all embodied in Satan,
the adversary: these attributes are not amiable ones,
but the writer does not suggest the absolute antagonism
between Jehovah and Satan, which is a fundamental dogma
of modern Christianity.
"In the prophecy of Zechariah, Satan again, with an
apparent personality, is represented as standing at the
right hand of Joshua, the high-priest, to resist him : he
seems to be claiming strict justice against one open to
accusation : for Joshua is clothed in filthy garments-the
type of sin and pollution. Jehovah relents, and mercy
triumphs over justice: the filthy garments are taken away,
and fair raiment substituted. Even here, the character
of Satan, although hard, is not devoid of virtue, for it
evinces a sense of ju~tice.''
The Babylonians, among whom the Hebrews dwelt during
the Captivity, believed in the existence of vast multitudes
of spirits, both good and bad, but there is nothing to show
that the Hebrews took over from them any extensive
pantheon, either good or evil. Indeed the Hebrew and
Babylonian religions possessed many things in common,
and there was no necessity that the captive Jews should
borrow an animism which they probably already possessed.
At the same time it is likely that they adopted the idea
of an evil a!:ency from their captors, and as the genius
of their relig10n was averse to polytheism, the probabilities
are that they welded the numerous evil forces of Baby-
lonian into one central figure. Again, it must have occurred
to them that if the world contained an evil principle, it
could not possibly emanate £rom God, whom they regarded
as all-good, and it was probably with the intention of
separating all evil from God that the personality of Satan
(having regard to the amount of evil 111 the universe) was
invested with such importance.
In later Judaism we find the concel?tion of Satan strongly
coloured by Persian dualism, and it has been supposed
that Asmodeus of the Book of Tobit is the same as Aeshara
Daewa of the Ancient Persians. Both ·· Satan" and
" Satans" were mentioned in the Book of Enoch, and in
Ecclesiasticus he was identified with the serpent of Genesis,
and in the·' Bookof the Secrets of Enoch "hlS revolt against
God and expulsion from Heaven are described. In the
Jewish Targinn, Samael, highest of the angels, merges
with Satan into a single personality.
The Satan of the New Testament is merely a reproduc-
tion of these later jewish form.:;. In ;\latthew he is
Devil 123
alluded to as the ·• Princeof Demons," and in Ephesians is
spoken of as ruling over a world of evil beings who dwell
in the lower heavens. Thus he is prince of the powers
of the air. In Revelation the war in Heaven between
God and Satan is described, and his imprisonment is
foreshadowed after the overthrow of the Beast and the
Kings of the earth, when he will be chained in the bottom-
less pit for one thousand years. After another period of
freedom he is fin:1lly cast into the lake of brimstone for ever.
According to the orthodox Christian belief of the present
day. Satan has been endowed with great powers fo:- the
purpose of tempting man to prove his fortitude. In the
middle ages, the belief in Satan and Satanic agencies was
overwhelming, and was inherited by Protestantism from
Roman Catholicism. This is not the place to enter into a
discussion ~s to the likelihood of the existence of an evil
being, but the great consensus of theological opinion is in
favour of such a theory.
Devil Worship : (1). The worship of Satan or Lucifer.
(2). The worship by semi-civilised or barbarous people;
of deities having a demoniac form.
The Worship of Sata11 or diabolism is spasmodic and oc-
casionallyepidemic. It dates from the early days of dualism
(q.v.) and perhaps originated in the Persian dual system
when the opposing deities Ormuzd and Ahriman symbo-
lised the good and bad princivles respectively. Instances
of pure Satanism arc comparatively rare, and it must not be
confounded with the Sabbatic orgit!s of witchcraft which
partake mort! of the 11ature of (2), or with the
evocation of the Evil One, for the pur~;~ost! of making a
pact with him. :Modern groups practismg Satanism are
small and obscure, and, unorganised as they are, details
concerning them nrc conspicuous by their absence.
Plentiful details, however, are forthcoming concerning
the cultus of Lucifer, but much discrimination is required
in dealing with these. the bulk of the literature on the
subject being manifestly imaginative and wilfully mis-
leading. The members of the church of Lucifer are of
two groups. those who regard the deity they adore as the
evil principle, thus approximating to the standpoint of the
Satanists, and those who look upon him as the true god in
opposition to A(lonai or Jehovah, whom they regard as an
evil deity who has with fiendish ingenuity miscreated the
world of man to the detriment of humanity.
Modern diabolic literature is written from the point of
view of the Homan Catholic Church, and much may be
said for the theory thM it was composed to subserve the
necessities of that institution. But this cannot be wholly
true, as it is a substantial fact that hosts are frequently
abstracted f1·om C~tholic churches for the puTIJOSe of Satanic
rite which requires the destruction of the consecrated wafer
as a ritual act. In 1894 a hundred consecrated ho~ts were
stolen from .t>:otre name by an old woman under circum-
stances that clearly proved that the vesst!ls which contained
them were not the objects of the theft, and an extra-
ordinary number of such larcencies occurred in all parts
of France about the end of last century, no less than
thirteen churchcs in the diocese of Orleans being thus
despoiled. In the diocese of Lyons measures were taken
to transform the tabernacles into strong-boxes, and in
eleven of the dioceses similar acts wert! recorded. In Italy,
Rome, Liguria and Solcrus suffered, and evt!n in the Island
of ~fauritius an outrage of peculiar atrocity occurred in
1 895. lt ha~ been asserted by rnany writers such as
Archbishop Meurin and Dr. Bataillt! that Freemasonry
is merely a mask for Satanism, that is, that in recent years

change is indignantly denied by masons, but it must be
remembered that the persons who bring it arc Catholics,
who have a direct interest in humiliating the fraternity.
Bataille and ~largiotta have it that the order of the Palla-
dium or Sovereign Council of Wisdom, was constituted in
France in 1737. and this, they infer, is one and the same
as the legendary Palladium of the Templars, better known
by the name of Baphomet (q.v.) In t8ot one Isaac Long, a
Jew, carried the "Original image" of Baphomet to Charleston
1n the United States, and it is alleged that the iodge he
fonoded then became the chief in the Ancient and Accepted
Scotch Ritt!. He was succeeded in due course by Albert
Pike, who, it i~ alleged, extended the Scotch Rite, and
shared the Anti-Catholic ~lasonic chieftainship with the
Italian patriot Mazzini. This new directory was estab-
lished, it is asserted. as the new Reformed Palladium Rite
or the Reformed Palladium. Assisted by Gallatin i\1ackey,
one Longfellow, Holbrook and a Swiss. Phileas Walder by
name, Pike erected the new rite into an occult fraternity
with world-wide powers. and practised the occult arts so
well that we are asked to believe that the head lodge
at Chuleston was in constant communication with Lucifer I
Dr. Bataille in a wholly ludicrous work Le Diable a!! XIX
Siecle, states among other things that in 1881 his hero
"Dr. Hacks" in whom his own personn.lity is but thinly
disguised, visited Charleston in ~larch 1881, where he
met Albert Pike, Gallatin Mackey and other Satanists.
Mackey showed him his Arcula My$tica in appearance like
a liqueur stand, but in reality a diabolical telephone,
worked like the Urim and Thummim. Miss Diana
Vaughan, once a Palladist, Grand Mistress of the Temple,
and Grand lns{lectress of the Palladium, was converted to
Roman Cathohcism, and in MemoiYS of an ex-Pallndist,
(1895) she has ~ven an exhaustive account of her dealings
with the Satamsts of Charleston. She claims to be des-
cended from the alchemist Thom'l.s Vaughan, and re-
counts her adventures with Lucifer. These are so wholly
absurd that we must request freedom from the necessity
of recounting them. There is little doubt that :\!iss
Vaughan was either the victim of hallucination or else the
instrument of the Roman Catholic Church in its attempts
to brand Masonry as a vehicle of Satanism. The publi-
cations of Margiotta and Gabriel Pages are equally
puerile, and we may conclude that, if Satanismand the wor-
ship of Lucifer exists, that the rites of their churches are
carried on in such a secret manner, that few, even mystics
of eJ~:periencc. can be aware of them.
When applied to the ceremonies of barbarous races,
devil-worship is a misnomer, as the "devils" adored by
them are deities in their eye~. and onJy partake of the
diabolic nature in the view of missionaries and others.
But inasmuch as the gods possess a demoniac form they
may be classed as diabolic. Among these may be
enumerated many South American and African tribes.
The UaFes of Brazil worship Jurupari, a fiend·\ike
deity, to whom they consecrate their young men. His cult
is invested with the utmost seCrt!CV. The myth ol his
birth state~ that he was born of a virgin who conceived after
drinkin~ a draught of chahiri, or native! beer. She pos-
sessed no sexual parts, and could not give birth to the
god until bitten by a fish whilst bathing. When arrived
at man's e'ltate Jurupan invited the men of the tribe to a
drinking-bout, but the women refused to provtde the
liquor, and thus gained his illwill. He devoured the
children of the tribe because they had eaten of the uacu
tree which was sacred to him. The men, enraged at the
loss of their offspring. fell upon him. and cast him into a
fire, from the ashes of which grew the paxiuba tree, which
the Uaplls say is the bones o! Jurupari. \Yhilst .it .was
night the men cut down the tree and fashtoned It rnto
Devil Worship 124 Dladoehus
sacred instruments which must never be seen by the women,
on account of the dislike Jurupari conceived for them.
Should a woman chance to sec the sacred symbols per-
taining to the worship of Jurupari, she is at once poisoned.
On hearing the " Jurupari music" of the priests on the
occasion of one of his festivals the women of the tribe
wildly rush into concealment, nor dare to emerge from it
until all chance of danger is past. In all probability this
custom proceeds from the ancient usage common to most
American tribes that the rites of initiation of the men of
the tribe must not be ";tncssed by the women thereof,
probably on account of some more or less obscure totemic
reason or sex-jealousy analagous to the exclusion of women
fr<>m the rites of freemasonry, to which, strange to say,
the worship of Jurupari bears a ~trong resemblance.
This is a good example of the ·• de11il worship" of ~avage
races. The Chinese also placate devils (see China} as do the
people of Bur01a and C'\mbodia (q. v.} but in no sense can
their oblations to evil spirits be clas~ed as ·• worship," any
more than the gods of classic times may be regarded as
devils, simply because they were so labelled by early
Christianity. (See Gnostics, Obeah, Ju-ju, Devll, Demono-
logy, etc.)

Devil's Bridge : A bridge fbrown across the Afon 1\lynach,
near Abcrystwyth. The sto•y goes that an old woman
who had lost her cow saw it on the opposite side of the
chasm to that on which she stood, but knew not how
to reach it. At that junctu:-e the Evil One appeared to her
in the shape o! a monk, and promised to throw a bridge
across, if she would give him the first living thing that
would pass over it. The old lady agreed, the bridge "·as
cOm,Pleted, and the crafty fiend begged that she would
try 1t. But the old woman had observed his cloven hoof,
and knee bent bacJ..;vards, so she took a crust from her
pocket and flung it across the ravine, biddir::g her little
doggo fetch it. The Evil One was outwitted, as hegenerally
is in such tales.
Devil's Chain : There is a tradition in Switzerland that St.
Bernard has the de,·il chained in some mountains in the
neighbourhood of the Abbey of Clairvanx. From this
comes the custom, observed by the farmers of the country,
of striking three blows with tbc hammer on the anvil e,·err
).!onday morning before setting to work. By this means
the devil's chain is strengthened, so that he may not esC'ape.
Devil's Girdle, The: vVitches in mediaeval times were often
accused of we;1ring the Devil's Girdle, probably as a mark
of a11egiance to the Evil One. }.Iagical girdles were com-
monlyw<)rn, and a modern writersuggests that the magnetic
belts advertised at the present day had their origin in this
practice.
Devll's Pillar : There are ~reserved at Prague three stones
of a pillar which the devil brought from Rome to crush a
priest, with whom he had made a compact, and to kill
him while he said mass. But St. Peter, says the legend,
threw the de\'il and his pillar into the sea three times in
snccession, which diversion gave the priest time for
repentance. The devil was so chagrined that he broke
the pillar and saved himself.
Devil's Sonata : (See Visions.)
Devils, Afraid of Bells : It was an old snpcrstition th. t e,·il
spirits were afraid of bells and fled from the sound of them.
Devon, Witchcraft in : The belief in witchcraft is not yet
dead in Devonshire, as was shown in a curious case heard
in Crediton County Court not many year3 a~o, when a
young woman alleged that she was given a potion in a
grocer's shop, and that as a result, either of the draught
or of the incantation delivered while she w?.s in the shop,
she was gettin~ thinner every day. Only those who have
lived long in Devon can realise the widespread belief that
still exists in remote corners of the county of the power of
" the evil eye," and of the credence given to all kinds of
weird superstitions. " Witches " are believed to be able
to exercise a malig n influence even after death unless they
are buried with their toes downwards. Kot very long
ago, a woman suspected of bein:r a witch, was buried in
this way within twenty miles of Tiverton. In no part of
the country~,; witchcraft more believed in than in the Culm
Valley. There is a local sayin~~; that there are enough
witches in the '·alley to roll a ho~shcad of cider \tp the
Beacon Hill, at Culmstock, anti old people living in the
locality are not ash'\med to say that they believe in witch·
c.raft. The witches are of t" o kind~-" black " and
" white.'' The former profess to have the power to con-
demn those on whom they arc asked to cast a spell, to all
kinds o! misfortunes: the latter impose on credulous
clients by makin.~ them believe th?.t t)ley can remove
evil spells and bring good fortune--for a consideration, of
course. For obvious reasons visits to " "itches" are
generally kept dark, but every now and again particulars
leak out. In the Culmstock district, not so very long ago,
a young girl went with her mother to a witch, in order to
get a spell cast over an erra:1t SW:!.In, who was suspected of
bestowir.g his affections on another young lady. The
witch professed to be able to bring the young man back
to his first love, or to condemn him to nil kinds of torture,
but her price was prohibitive, and so the young man was
left to marry whom he would. Farmers are the \\;tches'
most prof1table clients, and it is a notewortl:y fact that they
generally contri,·e to visit the ·• wise woman " when they
are awav from home, "at market." A few years ago,
farmers ·used to go to Exeter for many miles round to
consnlt a witch whenever they had any mis!ortune, and it
is commonly reported that they can get the same sort of
advice in the city at the present dny. At manr farmhouses
Bibles are kept in the dairies to prevent witches from
retarding the butter-making operation~. " I'm '"itched,"
or ·• I must have been 'witched," are er.pre~ion~ heard in
Devon e\·ery day in the week. Generally speaking, it is
animals that arc supposed to sustain the most harm from
being " overlooked." The loss of cc-.ttlc that have died
has been put down to the power of evil spirit$, and accord-
ing to many superstitious people, ";tch~ have a peculiar
power over pigs. A man who believed his pigs had been
bewitched was told, not so long ago, to take the heart of
a pig, stick it full of pins and needles, and roast it at the
fire. He did this believing this would check the mortality
among his swine.
Diadocbus : According to l\[arbodaeus, this gem resembles
the beryl in its properties, and w...s most valuable in divina-
tion. It serves for the invocation of spirits, and oracular
responses could be discovered in it. Albertus Magnus
writes it Diacodos, and it is possibly to t his stone that
Braithwaite alludes in his Eu.t:lish Gentleman; ''For as
the precious stone Diacletes, though it have many rare
and excellent sovereignties in it, yet loseth them all if put
in a dead roan's mouth." Marbodacus mentions this in
his verses as a property of the d1adochus. The words o£
Leonardus are too curious to omit: " It disturbs devils
beyond all other stones, for, if it be thrown in water, with
the words of its charm sung, it shows various images of
devils, and gives answer to those that question it. Being
held in the mouth, <1 man may call any devil out of hell,
and receive satisfaction to such questions as he may ask."
He namas it Diacodas or Diacodus.

or augur. It is practised in all grades of barbarism and
civilisation. The methods of divination are manyand various,
and strangely enough in their variety are confined to no
one portion of the globe. Crystal-gazing has been relegated
to a separate articll:. Shell-hearing and similar methods
are allied to crystal-gazing and ~y be cla:.sed with it, as
that method of divination which arises from the personal
consciousness of the augur. Of the same class are divi-
t~ation by dreams, automatic writing, and so forth. What
might be called divination by " luck" is represented by
the use of cards, the casting of lots, the use of knuckle-bones
as iu Africa and elsewhere, cocoanuts as in Polynesia.
Haruspication, or the inspection of entrails, divination
by foot-print in ashes, by the flight of birds, by meeting
with ominous animals, represents the third class of augury.
The art of divit1atio11 is usually practised among savages
by the shaman ca~te ; among les~ barbarous people by the
augur, a~ in Rome and ancient Mexico ; and even amongst
civilised people by persons who pretend to divinatio11, such
as the spiritualistic medium or the witch. The art is un-
doubtedly of great antiquity. It was employed in ancient
Egypt side by side with astrology, and divination by dream
was constantly resorted to,-a class of priests being kept
apart, whose office it was to interpret drt>ams and visions.
We find instances of dreams recorded in the Egyptian
texts: as f01 example those of Thothmes lV. king of Egypt
in 1450 'R.C., and Nut-Amen, king of the Eastern Soudan
and Egypt about 670 B.C. The Egyptian magician
usually set himself to procure dreams for his clients by
such devices as the drawing of magical pictures and the
reciting of magical words; and some of these are still
extant, such as that in the British ~Iuseum papyrus No.rzz.
\Ve find, however, that in Egypt augury was usually ef-
fected by astrological methods.
In ancient China the principal method of divination
was by means of the oracles; but we find such forms as
the examination of the marks on the shell of a tortoise.
which reminds us of the examination of the back of a pec-
cary by the :\laya. of Central America. We find a Chinese
monarch consulting the fates in this manner in n46 B.C.
and finding them unfavourable; but as in Egypt, most
soothsaying was accomplishetl by means of astrology.
Omens, however, were by no means ignored, and were
given great prominence, as many tales in the ancient books
testify.
In ancient Rome a distinct caste or college of priests
called Augurs was set apart to interpret the signs of ap-
proval or disapproval sent by tht! gods in reference to any
coming event. This college probably consisted originally
of but three members, of whom the king himself was one;
and it was not until the time of Cccsar that the members
were increased to sixteen. The college remained in ex-
istence as late as the fourth century, and its members held
office for life. The tenets of the Roman augurs were, that
for signs of the gods one must look towards the sky and
glean knowledge of the behests of the divine beings from
such omens as the lightning-flash, and the flight of birds.
On a windless night, the augur took up his position on a
hill which afforded an e:ottcnsivc view. Marking out a
space for himself, he pitched a tent within it, and seating
himself therein with covered head requested the gods for
a sign, and waited for an answ~r. He faced southwards,
thus having the east, or lucky quarter, on his left, and the
west, or unfavourable portion of the sky, on his right. He
carefully observed every sign which carne within the pur-
view of his vision: such as lightning, the appearance of
birds, and so forth. The song or utterance of birds was
also carefully hearkened to; and these were divided into
birds of good omen and evil omen : while others referred
to definite persons and events. The reading of omens
Divination
wa~ also effected by the feeding of birds and observing
the manner in which they ate. The course of animals
and the sounds uttered by them were also closely watched,
and all unusual phenomena were regarded as omens or
warnings. Sortilege or the ca~ting of lots was often re-
sorted to by the caste of augurs. The election of magis·
trates \'·as nearly always referred to the Auspices or College
of Diviners, a~ were the setting out of an army for war,
and the passing of laws.
In the East generally, dit•inotiou appears to have been
effected by crystal-gazing, dreams and similar methods
of self-hallucination, or self-hypnotism. Divination
flourished in Chaldca and Assyria among the Babylonians
and Ethiopians, and appears to ha' e been very much the
same as in Egypt. In the Jewish 1 a/mud we notice that
witches are srud to divine by means of bread-crumbs.
Among the Arabs, the future is often foretold by means
of the shapes seen in sand. The Burmese and Siamese
pierce an egg at each end, and having blown the contents
on the ground, trace within them the outline of things
to be. (Su Burma.) Divination by astrology toe. is very
common in oriental countries, ami prophetic utterance
is likewise in great favour.
It is remarkable that among the native races of America
the same arts of divination as are known to the peoples
of the Old World were and arc in vogue. These arts, as
a rule, arc the preserve of the medicine-man and rriestly
class. In ancient l\Iexico there was a college of augurs
corresponding in purpose to the Auspices of ancient Rome,
the members of which occupied themsch·cs with observing
the flight and listening to the songs of birds, from which
they drew their conclusions. In llle:xico, the Colmecac
or college of priests had a department where divination
was taught in all its branches, but there were many ex
officio prophets and augurs, and the reader is referred to
the article on Mexico for an account of the <:strological
methods of casting nativities, and so forth. Oracles were
common, and in this connection an amusing Peruvian
story may be recalled. A certain huo(a or oracle was
reported to be of evil influence; orders were gh·en to
destrov it; and upon its being broken up a parrot found
means· to escape from within it,-thus g1ving us a pretty
shrewd idea of the means employed by the rriesthood to
effect oracular utterance. In Peru, still othtr classes of
diviners predicted by means of the lean•s of tobacco, or
the grains or juice of coca, the shapes of grains of maize,
taken at random, the forms assumed by the smoke rising
from burning victim~. the viscera of animals, the course
taken by spiders, and the direction in which fruits might
fall. The professors of these sc,·eral methods were dis-
tinguished by different ranks and titles, and their training
was a long and arduous one. The American tribes as a
whole were very keen observers of bird life. Strangely
enough the bird and serpent are combined in their sym-
bolism, and indeed in the names of several of their prin-
cipal deities. The bird appeared to the American savage
as a spirit, in all probability under the spell of some potent
enchanter-a spell which might be broken by some great
sorcerer or rncdicint! man alone. As among the ancient
Romans, the birds of America were divided into those of
good and evil omen ; and inde<'d certain Brazilian tribe:;
appear to think that. the souls of departed lnd1a_ns e~ter
into the bodies of b1rds. The shamans of certam tnbes
of Paraguay act as go-'?etweens bet,~een _the mem_bers of
their tribes and such blfdS as they 1magmc enshnne the
souls f'f their departed rdatives. This usage would appear
to combine the acts of augury and necromancy.
The t:riesthood of Peru p~actised oracular mcth~s by
" making idols speak," and th1s they probablyaccomplished
by ventriloquial arts. The piages or priests of the Uap~
Divination 127
of Brazil have a contrivance known to them as the paxiuba,
which consists of a tree-stem about the height of a man,
on which the branches and leaves have been left. Holes
are bored in the trunk beneath the foliage, and by speaking
through these the leaves are made to tremble, and the
sound so caused is interpreted as a message from Jurupari
one of their principal deities. But all over the American
continent from the Eskimos to the Patagonians, the methods
of oracular divinatio11 are practically identical. The sha-
man or medicine-man raises a tent or hut which he enters
carefully closing the aperture after him. He then proceeds
to make his incantations, and in a little while the entire
lodge trembles and rocks, the poles bend to breaking point,
as if a dozen strong men were straining at them, and the
most violent noise comes from within, seemingly now em·
anating from the depths of the earth, now from the air
above, and now from the vicinity of the hut itself. The
reason for this disturbance has never been properly ac-
counted for; and medicine-men who have been converted
to Christianity have assured scientific workers amongst
Indian tribes that they have not the least idea of what
occurred during the time they occupied these enchanted
lodges, for the simplo reason that they were plunged
in a deep sleep. After lhe supernatural sounds have to
some extent faded away, the medicine-man proceeds to
question the spirit he has evoked,-the answers of whom
for sheer ambiguity arc equal to those of the Pythonesses
of ancient Greece. There is little doubt that the shamans
who practise this method of oracular utterance are the
victims of hallucination, and many cases are on record
in which they have excited themselves into a condition
of permanent lunacy.
America is the touchstone of the science of anthropology,
and since we have adopted it as the continent from which
to draw the majority of our illustrations, it will be as well
if we conclude the article on American lines for the sake
of comparison. We find then that divinatum by hypnosis
is well-known in the western continent. Jonathan Carver,
"':ho travelled among the Sioux about the latter end of the
etghtcenth century, mentions it as in use amongst them.
The ·• Ghost Dance " religion of the Indians of Nevada
had for one of its tenets the belief in hypnotic communion
with the dead. Divi11atio11 by means of dreams and visions
is extremely common in both sub-continents of the western
hemisphere, as is exemplified by the derivation of the word
"priest" in the native languages·: by the Algonquians they
are called "dreamers of the gods," by the Maya " listen·
ers," and so forth. The ability to see visions was usually
quickened b7 the use of drugs or the swallowing or inhala·
tion of cerebral intoxicants, such as tob?cco, maguey, coca,
the snake-plant, and so forth. Indeed many Indian tribes,
such as the Creeks, possessed numerous plants which they
cultivated for this purpose. A large number of instances
are on record in which Indian medicine-men are said to
have divined the future in a most striking manner, and
perhaps the following will serve to illustrate this :
In his autobiography, Black Hawk, a celebrated Sac
chief, relates that his grandfather had a strong belief that
in four years' time • he should sec a white man, who would
be to him as a father.' Supernaturally directed, as he
said, he travelled eastward to a certain spot, and there,
as he had been informed in dreams, met with a Frenchman
who concluded an alliance on behalf of his country with
the Sac nation. Coincidence is certainly possible here,
but it can hardly exist in the circumstances of Jonathan
Carver. V.'hilc he was dwelling with the Killistenoes,
they were threatened with a famine, and on the arrival
of certain traders, who brought them food in exchange
for skin~ and other goods, their very existence depended.
The dtvtners of the tribe were consequently consulted by
Divination:
the chief, and announced that the next day, at high noon
exactly, a canoe would make its appearance with news
of the anxiously looked-for expedition. The entire popu-
lation came down to the beach in order to witness its
arrival, accompanied by the incredulous trader, and, to his
intense surprise, at the very moment forecasted by the
shamans, a eanoc rounded a distant headland, and, paddling
speedily shorewards, brought the patient Killistenoes news
of the expedition t hey expected.
John wlason Brown has put on record an equally singu·
lar instance of the prophetic gift on the part of an American
medicine-man. (See Atlantic .McmJhly, July, 1866.) He
was engaged several years previously in searching for a
band of Indians in the neighbourhood of the .Mackenzie
and Copperminc rivers ; but the difficulties of the search
induced the majority of his band to return, until out of
ten men who originally set out only three remained. They
had all but concluded to abandon their search when they
stumbled upon a party of braves of the very tribe of which
they were in search. These men had been sent out by
their medicine-men to find three whites, of whose horses,
accoutrements, and general appearance the shaman had
given them an exhaustive account ere they set out, and
this the warriors related to Brown before they saw his
companions. Brown very naturally inquired closely of
the medicine-man how he had been ablu to foretell their
corning. But the latter, who appeared to be 'a frank
and simple-minded man,' could only explain that • he saw
them corning, and heard them talk on their journey.'
Crystal-gazing is in common use amongst many Indian
tribes. The Aztecs of Mexico were wont to gaze into small
polished pieces of sandstone, and a case is on record where
a Cherokee Indian kept a divining crystal wrapped up in
buckskin in a cave, occasionally " fcc<ling " it by rubbing
over it the blood o{ a deer. At a village in Guatemala,
Stephens saw a remarkable stone which had been placed
on the altar of the church there, but which had previously
been used as a divining-stone by the Indians of the district.
Divination by arrow was a!so commonly resorted to.
According to Fuentes, the chronicler of Guatemala
the reigning king of Kichc, Kicah Tanub, when informed
by the arnbassadot of Montezuma II. that a race of irre-
sistible white men had conquered Mexico and were pro-
ceeding to Guatemala, sent for four diviners, whQm he
commanded to teJJ him what would be the result of tbis
invasion. They asked for time to discover the future fate
of his kingdom, and taking their bows discharged some
arrows against a rock. They returned to inform their
master that, as no impression had been made upon the
rock by the arrowheads, they must prognosticate the worst
and predicted the ultimate triumph of the white man-
a circumstance which shows that the class to which they
belonged stood in no fear of royalty. Kicah Tanub, dis-
satisfied, sent for the ' priests,' obviously a different class
from the diviners, and requested their opinions. From
the ominous circumstance of an ancient stone-which had
been brought from afar by their forefathers-having been
broken, they also augured the fall of the Kiche empire.
Many objects such as small clay birds, boats or boat-
shaped vessels, etc., have been discovered in sepulchral
mounds. in North America, and it is conjectured that these
may have been used for purposes of divination. As any
object might become a fetish, it is probable that any object
might become a means of augury. The method employed
appears to have been so to treat the object that the prob·
able chances for or against the happening of a certain event
would be discovered-much, indeed, as some persons ·wilt
toss coins to " find out " whether an expected event will
come to pass or not. Portents, too, were implicitly be-
lieved in by the American races, and this branch of augury
Divine 128
was, we find, one of the accomplishments of Nezahualpilli,
king of Tezcuco, ne:u Mexico, whom Montezuma consulted
concernin"' the terrible prodigies which startled his people
prior to the advance of the Spaniards upon his kin:;dom,
and which were supposed to predict the return of Quet-
zacloatl, the legendary culture-hero of Anahuac, to his
own again. Thes:: included earthquakes, tempests, floods,
the appea~anccs of comet:s and s.trangc lights•. ":'hil~t mys-
terious vo1ces were heard m the a~r-such prodtg1es, mdeed,
as tradition u~ually insists upon as the precursors of the
downfall of a mighty empire.
The various methods of divination have each been ac-
corded a separate article: thus the reader is referred to
Axinomancy, BelomaM~, Capnomancy, _and so f~rth ;
and in the articles deahng w1th the vn=•ou3 countnes a
goodly number of i:'lstances of divinatory practice \\~ll
be dic;covered.
Divine Name, Th$ : In Jewish mysticism !!reat stress is laid
upon the importance of tl1e Divine Name. It consists
of forty-two letters ; not, as .?\loses Maimonider. points
out, comprised in o:te word, but in. a phrase of several
words, which conveyed an exact notton of the essence of
God. With the priestly decadence in the last days of the
Temple, a name of twelve letters was substit_uted for the
Divine Name, and as time went on even thiS secondary
name was not divulged to every priest, but only to a few.
The longer name was sometimes said to contain forty-five
or seventy-two lettt>rs. The ten Sefiroth are also supposed,
in a mystic:1l sense, to l>e the nlme~ of the Deity. The
Divin.e Name Jalweh is greater than •· I am that I am,
since the latter signifies God as Tie wa~ before the creation,
the Absolute, the 'Unknowable, the Hidden One; but the
former denote~ the Supreme Manifestation, the immanence
of God in the Cosmos.
Divine World: Formerly known as the Adi Plane-is in
the theosophic scheme of things, tb.e first or highest world,
(in Theosophy) the world .first formed by the divine im-
pulse in the creative process. It io; unattainable by man
in his present state. (Stll Theosophy and Solar System.)
Divining Rod : A forked rod, or branch of tree, which in tbe
hands of certain people is said to indicate, by means of
spasmodic movements of varying intensity, the presence
of water and min:.-rals underground. Traces of the rod
used for purposes of divination are to be found in the records
of Ancient Egypt. Cicero and Tacitus both wrote of the
rod "virgula divina." This ancient divining rod was a
form of rhabdomancy (c;.v.) or divination by means of
little pieces of stick. In Germany it was known as the
" wishing-rod " and was used just as fortune-tellers use
cards, coffee or tea-grounds at the present d:l.y. Agricola's
De Re Metallica published at Basle, at the beginning of
the sixteenth century, makes reference to another rod ·which
he calls the virgula furcata," the forked, rod to distinguish
it from the " virgula divina." This rod, he said, was used
by miners to discover mineral lodes; rhabdomancy having
nothing to do with this use of the divi11i11g rod. Melanc-
thon mentions tins use of the rod and ascribed the
behaviour of t~e" instrument" in the discovery of metallic
ores to the law o! sympathy, according to the belief then
obtaining that metals, trees and other natural objects
had certain subtle relationships with eac:h other; and
believers in this theory pointed to the fact that trees which
g•cw above mineral lodes droop as though attracted down-
wards; the modern scientific explao:~tion of this natural
phenomenon being that it is due to the poverty of the soil.
In Sebastian )1inister's Cosmography, afso of the sixteenth
century, may be found engraving-; of these "mineral
divinero;" at work. The priests of that time persecuted
them as demons in disguise; they were also included in
the witchcraft persecutions, suffering tortures and burning
Divining Rod
to death. Among miners on the Continent the use of the
" virgula furcata" became universal, especially in the
Harz Mountains and throughout Saxony. In Germany
it was called the Schlag-Ruthe, "striking-rod " from the
fact of 1ts appearing to strike when held over mineral ores.
Robert Boyle, the " father of chemistry" is the first
to make mention of the divi1zing rod in England. In an
essay of his published in r663 m~y be found the following
" A forked hazel twig is held by its horns, one in each hand,
the holder wal~ing w:th tt over places where mineral lodes
m3.y ba suspected, and it is said that the fork by dipping
down w~ll discover the place where the ore is to be found.
1\tany eminent authors, among,;t others our distinguished
countryman Gabriel .Plat, ascribe much to this detecting
wand, and others, far from credulous or ignorant, have
as eye-vlitnesses spoken of its value. When visiting the
lead-mines of Somersetshire 1 saw its use, and one gentle-
man who employed it declared that it moved without his
will, and I saw it bend so strongly a~ to break in his hand.
It will only succeed in some men's hands, and those who
have seen it may much more reatlily believe than those
who have not." Some authorities on the subject state
that it was first brought into England in the time of Queen
Elizabeth. In the State papers of that reign may be found
recorded the fact that commissioners were sent to Germany
to study the best methods of mininJS and brought back
with them German miners !rom the Harz Mountains; and
that these ·• foreigners " introduccd the diuining rnd into
Eo~l:\n<l o;eem~ hi~hly prob:lble. Itw<'.'l first U5t'd for water
findin~, howe,·er, in Southern Fr.'\n.:c, and not until a cen-
tury later wao; it used in England for this purpose. It
bec:une the ·• dowsing rod " in England and Somers<'tshire
mi,t:ht be calle.i the home of the .. dowser." Locke the
philosopher, a Somersetshire m~.n referred in 169l to the
•• dO\\ Sing rod" and De Quinccy, also belonging to the
county, tells of singul:l.r cases of " jousers " as he calls
them. Down to the present day Uti.~ means of finding
water is used, farmers and owners of large estates sending
for a ·• dowser •· when they wish to find a spring of water.
These men arc not geologists, who might have a scientific
knowledge of the locality, they are often merely labourers.
The rods arc moo;tly cut from the hazel, but all kinds of
nut and fruit trees have been usecl, white and black thorn
and privet also being favourites. Pieces of watch-spring
and copper-wire arc also used ; and in some cases the
forked rod is dispensed with, the peculiar sensation felt
in the arms, hands and body being sufficient to indicate
the w~ter. These dowsers wander 0\'Cr the ground with
the ends of the fork gr:1.sped in the palm~ of the hands and
the rod downwards and when this moves, turning suddenly
in his hand, upw~rds, it is said !or water, downwards for
minerals, at that spot will be found the desired object,
absolute correctness frequently bc·ing achieved. In
later years attempts have been made to scientifically in-
vestigate the question and amongst amateur "dowsers"
we find the names of Lord Farrer and the late Mr. Andrew
Lang. As to the theory for these movements the electrical
or magnetic theory wa~ exploded by Father Kircher in
1654 who balanced the rod on a frictionless support like
a delicate pair of scales and found that in this position
nothing would induce it to move over hidden water or
metal. It must be held by some human being before the
movements take place. Chevreul, the French savant,
in 1 R54 put forward the theory of involuntary muscular
action. A modern scientist gives his opinion that very
possibly it is due to a f::.culty in the ''dowser" akin to
that possessed by a medium: " some transcendental per-
ceptive power unconsciously possessed by certain persons,
a faculty analogous to what is called clairvoyance. Not
exactly to be described as ' clear-seeing ' but rather, a.
Divs 129 D'Ourches
dim, obscure impression not reaching the brain through
the organ of vision, seldom ever rising to the level of a con-
scious impression, but one able to start the nervous retl.ex
action which caused the muscles to twitch and the rod or
other ' autoscope' to move. Doubtless. changes of blood
pressureand pulse rate also occur in the dowser ; and ifthis
be so, quite possiblr modern instrumental appliances for
recording these wil ultimately supersede the primitive
forked twig." He goes on to say that : " The • dowser '
in fact, 'feel<; for' and subconsciously discerns the bidden
object, whether it be water, bidden treasUre or even a
malefactor concealing himself from justice, who was pur-
sued and discovered by the agency of the famous dowser
Jacques Aymar, using his supernormal powers in 1692."

Divs : The diu of ancient Persia, pronounced deo, deu, or
dive, is supposed to be the same as the Euro;>ean devil of
the middle ages. In the romances of Persia they are repre-
sented as male and female, but the male divs are considered
the more dangerous, and it is !rom their character, per-
sonified in a supposed chief, that the devil is painted with
his well-known attributes. The male divs, according to
the legends of Persia, were entrusted with the government
of the world for seven thousand years anterior to the crea-
tion of Adam, and they were succeeded by the femal.e divs
or peris, who under their chief, Gian ben Gian, ruled other
two t housand years. The dominion of the peris was ter-
minated by Eblis (the devil of the Kor:ln) who had been
~reated from the elements of fire, and whose abode was
previously with the angels. Eblis or Haris, as he is also
called, became the leader of the rebellious angels when
they were commanded to do homage to the first created
m~n. and be'ing joined by the whole race of genii, the male
and female divs, whom he had formerly subjugated, he
was like them deprived of grace. Eblis and his imme-
diate followers were condemned to suffer for a long peried
in the infernal regions, but the remainder were allowed
to wander over the earth, a constant source of misery to
themselves and to the human race, whose obedience is
put to the test by their devices, and secured by the example
of their degradation and sufferings. They are supposed
to assume various forms, especially that of the serpent,
and in the drawings annexed to the Persian ror.:1ances they
arc represented much as our own devils, ogres, and giants,
in the tales of the middle ages. The writers of the later
ages, both Arabian and Persian, have localised the abode
of these evil genii in the mountain Kaf; their capital is
Aherman-abad, the abode of Aherman their chief, who
is identified with the Ahremanes of the Manicheans, that
remarkable sect being said to have borrowed their doc-
trines from Zoroaster. The distinction of sex is a remark-
able characteristic of the divs, and its evil results in a system
of diabolic superstition may be read in the stories of the
Ephialtae and Hyphialtae, or nightmare.
Evidently tl\c same in origin as the Persian dit•s, are
the daivers of the Hindoos, who inhabit a world which is
called, after them, Daiver-Logum. \Ve may borrow a
brief account of them from Kindersley's Specimens of
Hindco Literature. "The daivers," he says, " per-
petually recur in-their romances, and other literary works,
and are represented as possessing not only material bodies,
but as being subject to human frailties. Those saints
and heroes who may not as yet be considered worthy of
the paradises of Shivven or of Veeshnoo, are represented
as inhabiting the Daiver-Logum (or Sorgum). These
daivers are in number no less than three hundred and thirty
millions. The principal are.-I. ' Daivuntren ' or' Indiren '
their king ; to whom report is ma.de of all that happens
among them. His court "( audience is so capacious as to
contain not only the numerous daivcrs, but also the
prophets, attendants, etc. They are represented in the
mythologit:ll romances of the Hindoos, as having been
engaged in bloody wars, and with various success against
the giants (Assoores). The family of Daivuntren consists
of his wife · Indcrauncc,' and his son • Seedera-budderen '
(born from a cow), who records the actions of men, by
which they are finally to be judged. 11. The attendants
or companions of these daivers are.-r. The 'Kinnarer,'
who sing and play on musical instruments. 2. ' Dum-
barim Nardir,' who also perform on a species of drum.
3· · Kimprushcr,' who wait on· the daivers and are repre-
sented with the wings and fair countenances of angels.
4· ' Kunda-gaindoorcr,' similar win~ed beings who execute
the mandates of Veeshnoo. 5· • .l-'aunner' a species of
jugglers, who amuse the daivcrs with snake dancing, etc.
6. · Viddiaser,' their bards, who are acquainted with all
arts and sciences, and entertain them 'IIIith their histories
and discourses. 7· • Tsettee,' who attend them in their
aerial journeys. 8. • Kanuanadcr.' or • Dovdanks.' mes-
sengers, who conduct the votaries of Veeshnoo and Shivven
to their respective paradises, and the wicked to hell
(Narekah), o! which 'Eemen' is sovereign. I ll. The
t hird class of daivergocl, daivers, or genii, arc the eight
keepers of the eight sides of the world, literally signified
by their general name of • Aushtatikcu-Pauligaur ; they
are-r. ' l ndiren,' who is no other than Daivuntren, named
above. 2 . ' Augne-Baugauven,' the god offire. 3. ' Eemen'
king of death and the infernal regions. 4· ' Nerudee,' the
element of earth represented under the figure of a giant.
5· ' Vaivoo,' god of air and winds. 6. • Varoonen,' god
of clouds 4nd rain. 7· 'Gooberen,' god of riches. 8. •Es-
saunien,' or Sbivvcn himself, in one of his r,oo8 appear-
ances on earth." To these principal daivers, Kindersley
adds without sufficient reason tflc • Reeshees ' of the Hin-
<!oos, and their tutelary god of virtue, " Derma-Daive."
For the true oriental doctrine of these evil genii the
Zet!d-Avesta may be consulted, which associates the idea
of evil more especially with the peris or female divs. con-
trary to the later rom:lnces of Islamism. This anomaly
reappears in our own fairy-tales, the same characters, which
at times, are iuvested with the most malignant attributes,
being often described under forms of sylph-like grace and
beauty.
Djemsebeed, The Cup of : A divination cup, which has been
the subject of many of the poems and myths of ancient
Persia. It was believed to have been found while digging
the foundations of Persepolis, filled with the .elixir of im-
mortality. In this magical cup wa's mirrored the whole
world, and everything, good and evil, was revealed therein.
The Persians had great faith in these revelations ; and
attributed the prosperity of their empire to the possession
of this famous cup.

Donn : Son of 1\Iidir the Proud ; .an Irish hero of medieval
legend. In the Colloquy of the Ancients we are told how
Finn and Kelta and five other champions were out hunting
one day, and followed a beautiful faun until it vanished
under ground. Seeking shelter in a noble mansion, they
were entertained by Donn mac Midir and his brother;
and their aid was asked against the rest of the Danaan
folk. It seems that thrice in the year they had to fight
their fairy foes, and all their followers had been killed ex·-
cepting the eight-and-twenty warriors themselves. The
faun which they ha<l followed had been an enchanted
maiden sent to entice them. After a year of successful
fighting, the Danaans were obliged to make peace.

Draconites: otherwise dentrites, draconius, or obsianus, is
descnbed by Alb!:rtus :.\Ia;nus as a shining black stone of
pyramidal figure. It is not very easy to obtain, as it must
be taken out of the head of a draJ;on, cut off while the
beast is still panting. It subdues all sorts of poison, and
endows it'! possessor with invincible courage. The kings
of the East esteemed it a great treasure.
Dragon : A purely fabulous monster of enormous size, com-
mon to almost all countries. Descriptions of its appearance
vary; but it appears to have been of a reptilian nature.
often of a red or green colour, sometimes with several heads
which vomited forth fire and vapours, and a large and
clumsy tail. It was of enormous strength; but the an-
cients believed that it could be charmed by music, and
the dragon which guarded the golden lleece was soothed
by the voice of Medea. ln India at the time of Alexander
the Great, a drago11 was worshipped as a god ; and in occult
history it is the manifestation of hell. The drago,1, how-
ever, is best known in legendary history as the terrible
monster, whose duty it was to provide the hero with op-
portunities of valour, and in this capacity it has figured
in many a tale. The legend of St. George and the Dragon
is familiar to everyone, and also the dYago" that was slain
by Sir Lancelot, one of the knights of King Arthur's Round
Table. In Revelation the drago11, a representation of the
Evil One, is overcome by the Archangel :\Iichael. On one
side of the coin given to thO'le who were cured of possession,
about the time of Henry VII., there was portrayed an
angel standing with both feet on a dragon. The :dea of the
dragon is perhaps evolved from the conception of the
earth, as a living being. a notion which would gain currency
from Earthquake and related phenomena.

Dreams : The vccult significance of dreams was a matter of
speculation arriong the wise at an early period in the history
of civilisation. In the articles upon Babylonia and Egypt
we have to some extent outlined the methods by w~ich the
wise men of thor.e countries divined the future from visions
seen in sleep, and to these we must refer the reader, as well
as to the articles dealing with other countries, sava<{e and
civilised, where he will discover a good de;~.l of data relating
to dreams and dream-lore. In this place we can only indi-
cate some of the more outstanding theories of antiquity
regarding the nature and causes of dreams and the manner
in which the ancient diviners generally interpreted them.
Dreams were regarded as of two kinds-false and true, in
either case emanating from a supernatural intelligence,
evil or good. By the ancients sleep was regarded as a
second life, in which the soul was freed from the body and
therefore much more active than during the waldng state.
The acts it observed and the scenes through which it
passed were thought to have a bearing on the future life of
the dreamer, but it is possible that the dream-life was
regarded as supernatural and "inverted," and that the
events which the bodiless spirit beheld were the opposites
of those which would later occur on the earth-plane. The
idea thus originated that " dreams go by contraries," as
both popular belief t.nd the many treatises upon the sub-
Dreams
ject of nightly visions assure us is the case.
However t~c belief in the divinatory character of dreams
arose, there 1s every proof that the1r causes and nature
exercised some of the greatest minds of antiquity. Aris-
totle believed them to arise solely from natural causes.
Posidonius the Stoic was of t!le opinion that they were of
three ~inds, the fir5t automatic, and coming from the
clear s1ght of the soul, the second from spirits and the
third from. God. Cratippus, Democritus, and Pythagoras
held doctnnes almost identical or differing only in detail,
Later, l.\lacrobius divided dreams into five kinds : the
dream. the vision. the ocular dream, the insomnium and
the phanta.'lm. The first i~ a figurati\·e and mysterious
repres::ntabon which requires an interpretation ; the
second was "'n exact representation of a future event in
sleep ; the third was a dream representing some priest or
divinity, who declared to the sleeper things to come;
the fourth was an ordinary dream not deserving of atten-
tion, and the fifth was a disturbed half-awake dream, a
species of nightmare. Other writers divide dreams into
accidental dreams and those which were induced for the
purposes of divination. We arc told by Herodotus that
in the temple of Bel in Babylon a priestess lay on a bed
ready to dream '·isions of the second class, and that the
beds of such soothsayers were often made of the skin of a
ram is well known. The ancient Hebrev;s obtained such
dreams by slc'!ping among tombs, and this especial gate-
way to the supernatural world seems to have been, and
still is known to the majority of nations, barbarous and the
reverse, as intim1.tcly as hypnotic and other methods of
reaching its plane~ and hearing its pronouncements.
Sleep was, of course, often induced by drugs. whether the
soma of the Hindi)()S, the pey<)llotl of the ancient Mexicans,
the haschish of the Arabs, or the opium of the 2\Ialays or
Chinese, and these narcotics which have the property of
inducing speedy sleep and of heightening inward vision
were and are greatly prized by professional dreamers all over
the world, e3pccially ao; they rendered dreaming almost
immediately po>
sible.
'\Vith the nature of ecstatic vision we have dealt under
the headin~ of Hypnotism and now that we have outlined
the older theories regarding the cause and nature of dreams
(for with the modern and purely ph)--siological theories on
the subject we have no concern m this place), we may pass
on to consider the methods by which dreams were read or
divined. As has been remarked, this was generally under-
taken by a special class of diviners, who in ancient Greece
were known as One10critikoi, or interpreters of dreams.
The first treatise on the subject is that of Artemidorus, who
lived in the time of Antoninus Pius. He differentiates
between the dreams of IGngs and those of commoners, as
he believes that the visions of royalty must have reference
to the commonwealth and not to the individual. Dreams
which represent something a~ happening to the individual
who dreams them, show that they have a persona! signifi-
cance, wherea<~ if the dYeam relates to another it will concern
him alone. He details the numerous species of dreams
throughout five books, and then adduces numerous exam-
ples. Neither for rule nor mustration have we any space
here, and indeed, the literature, popular and otherwise,
which treats of oneiromancy is so extensive and so readily
accessible that no necessity arises for so doing. Suffice
it to say that the rules of Artemidorus are far from clear,
and according to them, any dream might signify any event,
and any interpretation of the same m1ght be conr.idered
justifiable. The method of testing dreams according to
Amyraldus is his Discours su' les So11ges divins (Saumur,
1625)' is whether the instructions and advice that they
contain make for good or ill-a test it is impossible to
· Dreams 131
apply until after the result is known. But amyraldus
surmo~nts t!:lis difficulty by J?r?posing to test dreams by
the evtd.ence they show of dwme knowledge-by asking
oneself m short, whether the dream it was desired to
examine gave any evidence ofsuch things as God alone could
know. It would seem from an examination of such
dreams as were submitted to the diviners of antiquity that
the symbolism they exhibited was of a character so pro-
found that it could only be unriddled by an interpreter who
received divine aid, such as was afforded in the case of
Moses or Daniel. It is plain, however, that the most far-
fetched interpretations were given to many of the· most
e~ch-makinr dreams of antiquity, and indeed, the oneio-
cntlcal system is one of the weakest spots in the armour
of occult science, and was the fust of its departments to
fall into disrepute and become the prey of the charlatan.
There are not wanting serious students of the occult who
doubt entirely the occult significance of dream~. and it
mast be grant~d that no good reason exists for classing
them generally with the vision, or a condition of second
sight or ecstasy. See H. Hutchinson, Dreams and their
Meani~tgs, London, 190r; ]. C. Corquohoun, Magic,
Witchcraft and A11imal Magnetism, London, r8sr; H.
Christmas, The Cradle of the Twin Giants; London, 1849,
and many other popular ar1d more advanced handbooks
on the subject.
Dreams of Animals : It was believed by many that animals
dreamed. Pliny says : " Evident it IS, that horses, dogs,
kine, oxen, shecpe and goats, doe dreame. Whereupon
it is credibly also thought that all creatures that bring
forth their young quicke and living, doe the same. As
for those that lay egges, i.tis not so certian that they dreame;
but resolved it is that they doe sleepe:·
Dress, Phantom: The question of the apparel worn by ap-
paritions bas of late years aroused considerable controversy.
Says :Mr. Podmore: "The apparition commonly consists
simply of a figure, clothed as the percipient was accustomed
to see the agent clothed ; whereas to be true to life the
phantasm would as a rule have to appear in bed. In cases
where the vision gives no information as to the agent's
clothing and surroundings generally-and, as already said,
such cases form the great majority of the well attested
narratives-we may suppo~e that what is transmitted is
not any part of the superficial content of the agent's con-
sciousness. but an impression from the underlying massive
and permanent elements which represent his perr.onal
identity. The percipient's imagination is clearly com-
petent to clothe such an impress1on with appropriate im-
agery, must indeed so clothe 1t if tt is to rise into conscious-
ness at all." "The gho~ts, it will have been observed,
always appear clothed. Have clothes also ethereal coun-
terparts ? Such was and is the belief of many early races
of mankind, who leave clothes, food, and weapons in the
graves of the dead, or burn them on the funeral pile, that
their friends may have all they require in the spirit world.
But are we prepared to accept this view ? And again, these
ghosts commonly appear, not in the clothes which they
were wearing at cleath-for most deaths take place in bed-
but in some others, as will be seen :!rom an examination
of the stories alrC'ady cited. Are we to suppose the ethereal
body going to its wardrobe to clothe its nakedness withal?
or that, as in the case of Ensign Cavalcante's appearance
to Frau Reiken, the ghost will actually take off the ethereal
clothes it wore at death and replace them with others ?
It is scarcely nece~sary to pursue the subject. The diffi-
culties and contradicbons involved in adapting it to ex-
plain the clothes must prove fatal to the ghost theory."
Mr. Thistleton Dyer !>ays on the subject :
" It is the familiar dress worn in lifetime that is, in most
Dress
cases, one of the distinguishing features of the ghostf and
when Sir George Villicrs wanted to give a warning to his
son, the Duke of Buckingham, his spirit appeared to one
of the Duke's servants · in the very clothes he useli to
wear.' Mrs. Crowe, in her Night Side of Nature gave an
account of an apiJarition which appeared at a house in
Sarratt, Hertfordshire. lt was that of a well-dressed
gi:mtleman, in a blue coat and bright gilt buttons, but
without a head. It seems that this was reported to be
the ghost of a poor man of that neighbourhood who had
been murdered, and whose head had been ·cut off. He
could, therefore, only be recognised by his • blue coat and
bright gilt buttons.' Indeed, many ghosts have been
nicknamed from the kinds of dress in which they have
been in the habit of appearing. Thus the ghost at Allan-
bank v.-as known as ' Pearlin Jean,' from a species of lace
made of thread which she wore; and the 'White
Lady' at Ashley Hall-like other ghosts who have borne
the same name-from the white drapery in· which she
presented herself. Some lady ghosts have been styled
' Silky,' from the rustling of their silken costume, in the
wearing of which they have maintained the phantom
grandeur of their earthly life. The1e was the ' Silky ' at
Black Heddon who used to appear in silken attire, often-
times ' rattling in her silks'; and the spirit of Denton
Hall--also termed ' Silky '- walks about in a white silk
dress of antique fashion. This las.t • Silky' was thought
to be the ghost of a lady who was mistress to the profligate
Duke of Argyll in the reign of William Ill., and died sud-
denly, not without suspicion of murder, at Chirton, near
Shields-one of his residences. The ' Banshee of Loch
Nigdal, too, was arrayed in a silk dress, green in colour.
These traditions date from a period when silk was not in
common usc, and therefore attracted notice in country
places. Some years ago a ghost appeared at Hampton
Court, habited in a black satin dress with white kid gloves.
The White ' Lady of Sklpsea' makes her midnight sere-
nades clothed in long, white drapery. Lady Bothwell,
who haunted the mansion of Woodhouselee, always ap-
peared in white ; and the apparition of the mansion of
Hound"·ood, in BeTWickshire--bearing the name of
' Chappie '-is clad in silk attire.
" One of the ghosts seen at the celebrated \'lillington
Mill waS that of a female in greyish garments. Sometimes
she was said to be wrapped in a mantle, with her head
depressed and her hands crossed on her' lap. 'Walton
Abbey had its headless lady who used to haunt a certain
wainscotted chamber, dressed in blood-stained garments,
with her infant in her arms; and, in short, most of the
ghosts that have tenanted our country houses have been
noted for their distinctive dress.
" Daniel Defoe, in his Essay on the llislory atld Reality
of Apparitions, bas given many minute details as to the
dress of a ghost. He tells a laughable and highly amusing
story of some robbers who broke into a mansion in the
country, and, wbile ransacking one of the rooms, they
saw, in a chair, 'a grave, ancient man, with a long full-
bottomed wig, and a rich, brocaded gown,' etc. One of
the robbers threatened lo tear off his' rich brocaded gown,'
another hit at bim with a firclock, and was alarmed at
seeing it pass through the ai1 ; and then the old man
' changed into the most horrible monster that ever was
seen, with eyes like two fiery daggers red hot.' The same
apparition encountered them in different rooms, and at
last the servants, who were at the top of the house. throw-
ing some ' hand grenades ' down the chimneys of these
rooms, the thieves were dispersed. Without adding fur-
ther stories of this kind, which may be taken for what they
are worth, it is a generally received belief in ghost lore
Druidic 132 Dupuis
that spirits are accustomed to appear in the aresses which
they wore in their lifetime-a notion credited from the
days of Pliny the Younger to the present day.
" But the fact of ghosts appearing in earthly raiment
has excited the ridicule of many philosophers, who, even
admitting the possibility of a sp1ritual manifestation, deny
that there can be the gho~t or a suit of clothes. George
Cruikshank, too, who wa~ no believer in ghosts, sums up
the matter thus : • As it is clearly impossible for spirits
to wear dresses made o! t!!.e materials of earth, we should
like to know if there are spiritual outfitting shops for the
clothing of ghosts who pay visits on earth.' \Vhatever
the objections may be to the appearance of ghosts in human
attire, they have not hitherto overthrown the belief in
their being seen thus clothed, and Byron, describing the
• Black Friar' who haunted the cloisters and other parts
of Newstead Abbey, tells u~ that he was always
arrayed
Iu cowl, and beads, aqd dusky garb.
Indeed, as Dr. Tylor remarks, • It is an habitual feature
of the ghost stories of the civilised, as of the savage world,
that the ghost comes dressed, and even dressed in well-
known clothing worn in life.' And he adds that the doc-
trine of object-souls is held by the Algonguin tribes. the
islanders of the Fijian group. and the Karens of Burmah
-it being supposed that not only men aud beasts have
souls, but inorganic things. Thus, Mariner, describing
the Fijian belief, writes : • If a stone or any other sup-
stance is broken, imtnortality is equally its reward ; nay,
artificial bodies have equal good luck with men, and hogs,
and yams. If an axe or a chisel is worn out or broken up,
away flies its soul for the service of thP gods. The Fijians
can further show you a sort of natural well, or deep hole
in the ground, at one of their islands. ac•oss the bottom
of which runs a stream of water, in which you may clearly
see the souls of men and wome-n, beasts and plants, stocks
and stones, canoes and horses, and of all the broken utensils
of this frail world, swimming, or rather tumbling along,
one over the other, pPII-mell, into the regions of immor-
tality.' As it has been observed, animistic conceptions
of this kind are no more irrational than the popular idea
prevalent in civilised communities as to spirits appearing
in all kinds of garments."

Drum, l)tagic: (See Laplnnd.)
Drummer of Tedwortb : A poltergeist who haunted the
house of sir. John Mompesson, of Tedworth, Wilts, about
the year r66I and onwards. In March of that year ~.fom­
pesson had had a vagrant drummer brought before a
justice of the peace, whereby his drum was confiscated.
The instrument was taken to the house of l.\lompesson,
during the latter's absence, and itnmediately a violent
poltergeist disturbance broke out. Apparitions we.e
seen by members of the household, pieces of furniture
were seen to move of themselves, small objects were flung
about by invisible hands, the younger children were levi-
tated as they lay in thei• beds, and there was a continual
sound of drumming every night. The drummer, under-
stood to be the cause of the trouble, was transported,
when peace once more reigned in lhe affiicted household ;
but ere long he managed to return, when the disturbances
b•oke out with renewed vigour. There is no .first-hand
account of this poltergeist, save thnt of Jo~eph GJanvil-
Sadducismus TYiumplzatus, r668-and though Glanvil
is our authority for the whole story, that part of it which
he himself declares to have witnessed is ce•tainly not the
most marvellous, but describes scratchings and pantings
heard in the vicinity of the childrens' beds.
Du Potet : One of the original founders of spiritualism in
France, and oae of the first experimentalists in table-
turning, either in that country or elsewhere. (See France).
Du-Sitb (Black Elf.) : A little man. believed to be of fairy
ofigin, who killert Sir Lachlan Mor lll'Ciean at the battle
of Trai-Gruiuard, in Islay, Scotland, in the rear 1598.
The story runs that this little man offered his services to
Sir James Macdonald, the opponent of Sir Lachlan; and
that the latter's death was caused by an arrow which
struck him on the head, aud was afterwards found to be
an Elf-bolt. In reply to a question of :\IacJonald's the
little man replied : " I am called Du-sith, and you were
better to have me with rou than against you."

Dual Personality : In every form of cerebral dissociation
there is a disturbance of consciousness. Sometimes, and
especially in the trance, there occurs what is known as
" split consciousness," and the split may be so pronounced
that the subject seems to have two or more disbnct person-
alities. The secondary personality may differ from the
primary in many ways, and possess entirely distinct intel·
lectual and moral characteristics. The ent•anced sub-
ject may allude to his normal consciousness in the third
person, may criticise its opinions and attitude, or even
express direct antagoaism towards it. The secondary
personality sometimes alternates with the pdmary in
such a way as to suggest that two spirits are struggling to
possess the same physical organisation. Anothe. peculiar-
ity of this state is that whereas the normal consciousness
generally knows nothing of the others, the secondary
personalities have full knowledge of each other and of the
normal conciousness. Dual p:r.~o11ality is not confined
to the trance state, but may adse spontaneously. R. L.
Stevenson makes effective use of it in his Stra11ge Case
of DY. Jekyll and MY. llyde.
Dugilid, David : A Glasgow painting medium who achieved
considerable success in his line. He was a cabinet-make•.
who in 1866 found himself possessed of mediumistic facul-
ties. At fi.st an o•dinaty rapping medium, he speedily
developed the powe• of painting in trance, even in the
dark. A still higher stage of mediumship was reached
when direct drawings were produced in his presence. These
drawings. generally copies of Dutch masters, purporting
to be done by the original artists, are said not to have
been without some merit, apart from the fact that they
were done in complete darkness. The two principal con-
trols were Ruysdael and Steen. In 1869 control o! the
medium's organism was ta;.eu by Hafed, prince of Persia
at the beginning of the Christian era, and Archmagus.
Hafed related his many adventures through Duguid's
mediumship in a series of sittings exteuding over some
year3. A Persian of p•incely birth, he had borne arms
in his country's defence. Afte• extensive travels, he was
admitted to the magi, and ultimately became Archmagus.
He was of those who bore rich gifts to Bethlehem at the
birth of Christ. Finally Itt! met his death in the arena
at Rome. Hafed, Prince of Persia, was afterwards pub-
lished in book form. (See Spiritualism}.

age of twenty-four he was mlde professor of rhetoric
at Lisieux; but his inclination led him into the field of

Earth laid upon a Corpse: It is related in Pennant's Tour
that it was the custom in the Highlands of Scotland to
lay on the breast or the deceased a wooden platter con-
taining a little earth and a little salt-the former to sym·
bolizc the corruptibility of the body, the latter the incor-
ruptibility of the soul.

Eblis, or Haris as he is also called: the" Satan" of the Mo-
hammedans. It is said that he was an inmate of Azazil,
the heaven nearest God; and when the angels were com-
manded to bow down to the first man, Eblis was the chief
of those who rebelled. They were cast out of Azazil,
and Eblis and his followers were sentenced to suffer in
hell for a long time. It is supposed that he was composed
of the elements of fire; and that he succeeded the peris
in the government of the world.
Ech-Ulsque: A Gaelic word meaning water-horse. The
Ech-utSque was a goblin of Highl::lnd folk-lore, understood
to be a favourite form assumed b): the Kelpie, in order to
lure souls- to his master the Devtl. In the disguise of a
fine steed, beautifully a:ccoutred, the I<elpie grazed inno-
cently by the wayside. The weary traveller, passir.g by,
and believing this splendid animal to have strayed from
his master, was tempted to make use of him to help him
Oil his way; and the deceitful Kelpie, remaining quiet as
a lamb until the traveller was fairly mounted, would then
with a fiendish yell of triumph plunge headlong into an
adjacent pool. .It was l.lelieved that the soul of the un-
fortunate man, who had had no time to P.repare for death,
would thus be safely secured to the Evtl One ; while the
Kelpie received the body in payment for his trouble.
Echo D'Outre Tombe (Journal) : (See France.)
Eekartshausen, K. Von: Author of The Cloud on the Sanc-
t:Jary (1800). Eckarts!lausen, by birth and education an
intensely religious man, at first wrote several little books
of devotion that had great vogue in France and Germany.
He later. turned his attention to larger works of a more
profound character, such as that mentioned above. Ac-
cording to Eckartshausetl the requisite faculty of true com·
munio11 with the church is the inward conce.piion of things
spiritual and with this sense present, is posstblc the begin-
ning of Regeneration understood as the process of gradually
eliminating original sin. His work on the Interior Church
is in two rarts : first. cl ucidation of his doctrine ; second';
a series o dogmas or assertions derived therefrom.
Ectenle Foree : A supposed physical force emanating from
the person of the medium, and directed by his will, by
means of which objects may be moved without contact
in apparent defiance of natural laws. The exist~nce of
such a force was first postu.Jated by Count Agenor de Gas-
parin, to explain the phenomena of table-turning and
rapping, and the name Ectenic Force was bestowed upon
the supposed agency by de Gaspadn's colleague, M. Thury.
The experiments of Thury and de Gasparin are declared
to offer some of the most convincing evidence that spirit-
ualism can produce, and have influenced more than one
eminent student of psychic research. If it be true that
tables were moved without contact, then such a theory
is indeerl necessary. but the evidence for this type of phe-
nomena is not abundant.

Eel : The eel is credited wtth the possession of many mar-
vellous virtues. If he is left to ctic out of the water, his
body steeped in strong vinegar and the blood of a vulture,
and the whole placed under t>. dunghill, the composition
will raise from the de:::d anylh!ng brought to it, and will
giYe it life as before. It is al~o said that he who eats
the still warm heart of an eel wlll be seized vlith the spirit
of prophecy, and will pred!ct things to come. The
Egyptians worshipped the Bel, which their priests alone
hl'.d the right to cat. Magic eels were made in the
eighteenth century of flour and the juice of mutton.
There may be added a little anecdote told by William of
Malmesbury. A dean of the church of Elgin, in the county
of Moray in Scotland, haviug refused to cede his church
to some pious monks, was ch:mged, with all his canons,
into eels, which the brother cook made into a
stew.
Egbo, The: or Esik, is a secret society of Calabar, near the
Niger delta. The name means ·• t!ger," and the society is
divided into eleven grades, of which the first three are not
open to slaves. :Member~. as a rule, buy themselves into
the higher grades in their turn, and the money thus obtained
is shared among~t the Nycmrpa who form the inner circle.
The king is presidentof the !'Ocietyunder the title of Cyamba.
Each ~rade h:ls its special festival day, on which their Idem
or sp1rit-master exercises complete control. 'Whenever
an Egbo. day is announced, slaves, women, and children
take flight in all directions, as the nmbass:J.dor of the Idem,
armed with a heavy whip, goe:; through the village and
lashes everyone whom he may encounter. The Idem is
usually a hermit who Jives in the distant bush-land, and
when he appears it is in a fantastic guise of mats
·and l.lranches, which covers him from head to foot, and
with a black mask on his face. The principals of the order
themselves arc linked together by a garb of leaves so gath-
ered up that they seem to move in a connected mass.
"The Order of Free Egbos, (says Froebenius) is said to
have originated l:.t the fairs which were held at a great
palm-oil market in the interior, m!d....-ay between Calabar
al)d the Kamerun. As the pl:Lce became the scene of much
disorder, while the European trade made it necessary for
the maintenance of pubt:c credit that all engagements
should be strictly c:uricd out, this institution was formed
as a sort of Hanseatic Union under the most influential
traders, for the mutual safeguarding of their interests.
Later it acquired the politicl:.l character of a Vehmgericht
or secret tribunal, by bringing within its sphere of action
the whole police of the Calabars and the Kamerun. The
kings always sought to secure for themselves the Grand-
mastership of the Order, since otherwise their authority
would sink to a mere shadow. European skippers have
frequently found it to their advantage to be enrolled in
the lower grades, in order thereby the more easily to recover
their debts. A member of the Egbo bas the right to claim
as his own _property the sla\'C of his debtor, wherever he
may find him, merely by fastening a yellow strip to his
d.ress or loincloth. Even in the interior of the continent
the standing of an Egbo is still respected and feared, and
affords one a certain immunity from molestation, such as
Egg 134 Egypt
i9 absolutely needed for the extensive commercial specu-
lations in Africa.
" In the Kamerun, as a preliminary to their acceptance
into the Free Ekbos, the young mel?- ar~ sent f?r a P.rotrac~ed
period to the Mokokos, a bush tnbe 1n the mtenor : Wltb
these they live naked in the fields, and only now and then
dart out, clad in green leaves, to have a bath in the river.
All women, and especially slaves, are prohibited, under
heavy penalties, from apl?r~aching the forest where. th~y
reside. In the Kame.run, 1t 1s customary to pay particular
honour to a visitor, above all if he be a European, by in-
troducing the Egbo go:1t, which the people are othenvise
seldom allowed to set eyes upon.
" Holman reports that the whole of the Old Calabar
district is subject to the rule of the so-called Egbo laws.
These are promulgated at a secret Council, the Egbo As-
sembly, which is held in the • Palaver-house • erected for
this special purpose. In virtue of his sovereign rights,
the bead-chief presides, under the title of Cyamab, over
this assembly. Amongst the members of the Egbo there
are different ranks, which must be acquired in their due
order, one after the other. Holman quotes Englishmen
who state that Europeans have bought themselves into
the Egbo, and even into the Yampai, in order to be thus
better able to get in their money. He gives the following
as the names and prices of the different grades of Egbo :
I Abungo 125 bars
2 1\boko 75 bars
3 Makairo 400 copper bars
4 Bak.imboko 100 bars
5 Yampaic . • Sso copper bars
" To these must be added rum, clothes, membo, etc.
The Yampai is the only grade whose members are allowed
to sit in Council. The sums paid for the various titles of
the Egbo are distributed exclusively amongst the Yampai,
who, however, are not limited to a single share, since every
Yampai can multiply his title as often as he can purchase
shares, and these give him a claim to the receipt of the
corresponding quotas from the profits of the whole
institution."
Egg, Orphean : The cosmic doctrine of the Greek sage
Orpheus. He says~ "God, the uncreatcd and incom-
prehensible Being, created all things: the ether proceeded
from him ; from this the unshapely chaos and the dark
night arose, which at first covered all thlngs. The un-
shapen mass was formed into the shape of an egg, from
which all things have proceeded." The whole universe
has the form of an egg, and everything in it strives to attain
the same form. The Orphean theory has something in
common with the doctrines of the magnetic philosophers.
Eglamour of Artoys, Sir : A magical English legend- of
French origin. The poem tells of the winning of Christa-
bell by EglamOt<Y. Christabell's father will agree to the
union if Eglamot<r·will fulfil three tasks. He must conquer
the giant, Sir 1>-Iaroke; bring from a distant land the head
of an enormous boar, and lcill a powerful dragon which
has been devastating the country round Rome. In these
adventures he is successful, but is kept in Rome by illness.
Meantime, Christabell has given birth to a son, and is
banished by her angry father. Her son is stolen from her
by a griffin, and taken to Israel, where he is adopted by
the king and harned Degrabell. Many years afterwards,
Sir Eglamour and Degramour meet in a tournament for
the hand of Christabell. The former is successful, and
eventually their identities are revealed. EglamouY and
Christabell are married, and return to their native country
with their son.
Egllnton, William : A well known English medium, who in
1876 succeeded Slade as the principal exponent of slate-
writing (q.v.) Tbat Eglinlor~'s performances in this
direction were very skilfully carried out ther!l is abundant
evidence, for several practised conjurers, as well as many
other investigators, were entirely at a loss to explain the
modus opeYandi. Yet on one occasion, at least, Eglinton
wasseen-by Professor Lewis Cargill-to write the" spirit "
messages himself. This was in t886, when his slate-writing
was attracting attention. Some ten years earlier, when
he was giving materialisation seances, there were dis-
covered in his portmanteau a false beard and some muslin
draperies, which were found to correspond with fragmenu
cut from the hair and garments of the materialised spirit.
)Tor were these the only occasions on which he made use of
fraudulent means of producing mediumistic phenomena.
It may be oblected that Eglitllon was "controlled" to
procure drapenes and fake hair, but it necessarily casts a
dark shadow on his mediumshlp.
Egypt: To the peoples of antiquity as well as to those of the
modern world, Egypt appeared as the very mother of magic.
The reason for this widespread belief is not far to seek.
In Egypt the peoples of the ancient world found a magical
system much more highly developed than anything within
their native knowledge, and aga.in the cult of the dead with
which Egyptian religion was so deeply imbued, appeared
to the stranger to savour strongly of magical practice. It
must be borne in mind that, if the matter of the magical
papyri be omitted, the notices which we possess of Egyptian
magic are almost wholly fon:ign, so that it is wiser for a
proper understanding of Egyptian occultism to derive our
facts concerning it from the original native sources as far
as is possible. Like all other systems, the magic of the
Egyptians was of two kinds, that which was supposed to
benefit either the living or the dead, and that which bas
been known throughout the ages as " black" magic or
necromancy.
The contents of the 'Vestcar Papyrus show that as early
as the fo11rth dynasty, the working of magic was a recog-
nised art in Egypt, but in reality we must place the begin-
nings of Egyptian magical practice in neolithic times.
Throughout the centuries magical practice varied con·
siderably, but the principal means for its working remained
the same. That is to say, the Egyptians relied for magical
effect upon amulets, magic01l figures, pictures, and formul<e,
magical names and ceremonies, and the general apparatus
of the occult sciences.
The objects for which magic was exercised were numerous.
It exorcised storms, protected against wild beasts, poison,
disease, wounds, and the ghosts of the dead. One of the
most potent methods of guarding against misfortune of any
kind was the use of Amulets. It must not be assumed that
all ornaments or objects discovered on the mummy are of
magical potency. These are frequently the possession of
the J(a or double (q.v.), necessary to its comfort in a future
existence. The small crowns, sceptres, and emblems of
Osiris, usually executed in faie>Jtt, are placed beside the
dead person in order thAt he may wear them when he
becomes one ·with Osiris, and therefore a king. The
scarab, fashioned in the likeness of a scarabreus beetle,
symbolised resurrection. The dad symbolised the human
skeleton, and, therefore, perhaps, the dead and dismem-
bered Osiris. It has an influence on the restoration of the
deceased. The uza, or eye, signifies the health necessary
to the dead man's soul. The so-called "palettes" at one
time supposed to have been employed for the mixing of
paint, are now kno\'m to have been amulets inscribed with
words of power placed on the breasts of the dead in neo-
lithic times. The amulet of the menat was worn, or held,
with the sistrum by gods, kings, and priests, and was
supposed to bring joy and health to the wearer. It repre-
sented the vigour of the two sexes.
Spells.-The simplest type of spdl in use in Egypt, was
Egypt 135
that in which the exorcist threatens the evil principle, or
assures it that he can injure it. Generally, however, the
magician requests the assistance of the gods, or he may
pretend to that which he desires to exorcise that he iS a
god. Invocations, when written, were usually accom-
panied by a note to the effect that the formula had once
been employed successfully by a god-perhaps by a deified
priest. An incomprehensible and mysterious jargon was
employed, wh1ch was f.upposed to conceal the name of a
certain deity who was thus compelled to do the will of the
sorcerer. These gods were almost alway; those of foreign
nations, and the invocations themselves appear to· be
attempts at variou9 foreign idioms, employed, perhaps,
as sounding more mysterious than the native speech.
Great stress was laid upon the proper pronunciation of
these names, and failure in all cnses was held to lie at the
door of mis-pronunciation. The Book of the Dead (q.v.)
contains many such " words of power," and these were
intended to assist the journey of the dead in the under-
world of Amenti. It was believed that all supernatural
beings, good and evil, possessed hidden names, which if a
mari knew, he could compel them to do his will. The name,
indeed, was as much j:>art of a man as his body or soul.
The traveller through Amenti must tell not only the divine
gods their names, but must prove tb:>t he knew the names
of a number of the supposedly inanimate objects in the
dreary Egyptian Hades, if he desired to make any progress.
(See Gnostics and Names Magical.)
Magical Books.-l\lany magicnl books existed in Egypt
which contained spells and other formul<e for exorcism
and necromantic practice. Thus Medical Papyri in the
Leipsic collection contain formul<e spoken whilst preparing
drugs ; the Ebers Papyrus contains such spells ; the
Harris lllagical Papyrus, datiug from the New Kingdom,
and edited by Chabas, contains spells against crocodiles. The
priestly caste, who compiled those necromantic works, was
known as Kerlleb, or " scribes of the divine writings," and
even the sons of Pharaohs did notdisdain to enter their ranks.
Tile Rit11al of Egyptian Magic. I n many instances the
ritual of Egyptian magic possesses strong similarities to
the ceremonial of other systems and countries. \Vax
:figures were employed in lieu of the bodies of persons to
be bewitched or harmed and models of all kinds were
utilised in order that the physical force directed age.inst
them might react upon the persons or animals it was de-
sired to injute. But the principa.l rite in which ceremonial
magic was employed was the very elaborate one of mum-
mification. As each bandage was laid ifl its exact position
(;ertain words of power were uttered which were supposed
to be efficacious m the preservation of the part swathed .
After evisceration, the priest uttered an invocation to the
deceased, and then took a vase of liquid containing ten
perfumes, with which he smeared the body twice from
head to foot, taking especial care to anoint the head
thoroughly. The internal organs were then placed on
the body, and the backbone immersed in holy oil, supposed
to be an emanation from the gods Shu and Seb. Certain
precious stones were then laid on the mummy, each of
which had its magical .;ignificance. Thus crystal lightened
his face, and carnelian strengthened his steps. A priest
who personified the jackal·headed god, Anubis, then ad-
vanced, performed certain symbolical ceremonies on the
head of the mummy, and laid certain bandages upon it.
After a further anointing with oil the deoca.scd was declared
to have .. received his head." The mummy's left hand
was filled with thirty-six substances used in embalming,
symbolic of the thirty-six forms of tile god Osiris. The
body was then rubbed with holy oil, the toes wrapped
in linen, and after an appropriate address the ceremony
was completed.
Egypt
Dreams. The art of procuring dreams and their inter-
pretation was much practised in Egypt. As instances of
dreams recorded in Egyptian texts may be quoted those
of Thothmes IV. (B.C. 1450) and Nut-Amen, King of Egypt
(B.C. 670). The Egyptian magician procured dreams
for his clients by drawing magical pictures and the recita-
tion of magical words. The following formul<e for pro-
ducing a dream is taken from British :\iuseum Papyrus,
No. 122, lines 64 ff. and 359 ff.
" To obtain a vision from the god Bes: llfake a drawing
of 'Besa, as shewn below, on your left hand, and envelope
your hand in a strip of black cloth that has been consecrated
to Isis and lie down to sleep without speaking a word, even
in answer to a question. Wind the remainder of the cloth
round your neck. The ink with which you write must
be composed of the blood of a cow, the blood of a white
dove. fresh frankincense, myrrh, black writing ink, cin-
nabar, mulberry juice, rain-water, and the juice of worm-
wood and vetch. With this write your petition before
the setting sun, saying, • Send the truthful seer out of the
holy shrine, I beseech thee, Lampsuer, Sumarta, Baribas,
Dardalam, Iorlex: 0 Lord send the sacred deity Anuth,
Anuth, Salbana, Chambre, Breith, now, now, quickly,
quickly. Come in this very night.'"
" To procure dreams : Take a clean linen bag and write
upon it the names given below. Fold it up and make it
into a lamp-wick, and set it alight, pouring pure oil over
it. The word to be written is this : ' Armiuth, Lailam-
chouch, Anicnophrcphren, Phtha, Arcbentechtha.' Then
in the evening, when you arc going to bed, which you must
do without tou~hing food (or, pure from all defi.lement),
do thus: Approach the lamp and repeat seven t1mes the
formula given below : then extinguish it and lie down to
sleep. The formula is this : ' Sachmu .... epaema
Ligotereench: the Aeon, the Thunderer, Thou that hast
swallowed the snake and dost exhaust the moon, and dost
raise up the orb of the sun in his season, Chthetho is the
name ; I require, 0 lords of the gods, Seth, Chreps, give
me the information that I desire.' "
Medical Magic. Magic played a great part in Egyptian
medicine. On this point \1/eidemann says : " The Egyp-
tians were not great physicians : their methods were purely
empirical and their remedies of very doubtful value, but
the riskiness of their practice arose chiefly from their utter
inability to diagnose because of their ignorance of anatomy.
That the popular respect for the human body was great
we may gather from the fact that the Paraskhistai who
opened the body for embalmment were persecuted and
stoned as having committed a sinful although necessary
deed. The prescribed operations in preparing a body for
embalmment were never departed from, and taught but
little anatomy, so that until Greek times the Egyptians
had only the most imperfect and inaccurate ideas of the
human organism. They understood nothing about most
internal diseases, and especia lly nothing about diseases
of the brain, never suspecting them to be the result of
organic changes, but assuming them to be caused by
demons who had entered into the sick. Under these
circumstances medicines might be used to cause the
disapp~arance of the symptoms, but the ~urc was. !he
expuls10n of the demon. Hence the Egyptian phystctan
must also practise magic.
" According to late accounts, his functions were com-
paratively simple, for the human body had been divided
into thirty-s1x par~. each presided over by a certain demon,
and it sufficed to invoke the demon of the part affected
in order to bring about its cure-a view of matters funda-
mentally Egyptian. In the Book of the Dead v..c ~d
that different divinities were responsible for the well-bemg
of the bodies of the blessed; thus Nu had charge of the
Egypt 136
hair, Ra of the face. Hathor of the eyes, Apuat of the ears,
Anubis of the lips, while Thoth was guardian of all parts
of the body together. This doctrine was subsequently
applied to the living body, with the difference that for
the great gods named in the Book of the Dead there were
substituted as gods of healing the presiding deities of the
thirty-six decani, the thirty-six divisions of the Egyptian
zodiac, as we learn from the names given to them by Celsus
and preserved by Origen. In earlier times it was not so
easy to be determined which god \Vas to be invoked, for
the selection depended not only on the part affected but
also on the illness and symptoms and remedies to be
used. etc.
" Several Egyptian medical papyri which have come
down to us contain formulas to be spoken against the
demons of disease as well as prescriptions for the remedies
to be used in specified cases of illness. In papyri of older
date these conjurations arc comparatively rare. but the
further the art of medicine advanced, or rather receded,
the more numerous they became."
" It was not always enough to speak the formulas once ;
even their repeated recitation might not be successful,
and in that case recourse must be had to other expedients :
secret passes were made. various rites were performed,
the formulas were written upon papyrus, which the sick
person had to swallow, etc., etc. But amulets were in
general found to be most efficacious, and the personal
intervention of a god called up, if necessary, by prayers
or sorcery."
Magical Figures. As has been said the Egyptians be-
lieved that it was possible to transmit to the figure of any
person or animal the soul of the being which it r-epresented.
In the Westcar Papyrus we read how a soldier who had
fallen in love with a governor's wife was swallowed by a
crocodile when bathing, the saurian being a magical re-
plica of a waxen one made by the lady's husband. In
the official account of a conspiracy against Rameses III.
(ca B.C. 1200) the con~irators obtained access to a magical
papyrus in the royal hbrary and employed its instructions
against the king with disastrous effects to themselves.
These, too, made waxen figUTes of gods and of the king
for the purpose of slaying the latter.
Astrology: The Egyptians were fatalists, and believed
that a man's destiny was decided before he was born. The
people therefore had recourse to astrologers. Says Budge :
" In magical papyri we are often told not to perform cer-
tain magical ceremonies on such and such days, the idea
being that on these days hostile powers will make them
to be powerless, an<J that gods mightier than those to which
the petitioner would appeal will be in the ascendant. There
have come down to us fortunately, papyri containing copies
of the Egyptian calendar, in which each third of every
day for three hundred and sixty days of the year is marked
lucky or unlucky, and we !mow from other papyri why
certain days were lucky or unlucky, and why others were
only partly so." "From the life of Alexander the Great
by Pseud~Callisthenes we learn that the Egyptians were
skilled in the art of casting nativities, and that knowing
the exact moment of the birth of a man they proceeded
to construct his horoscope. Ncctanebus employed for
the purpose a tablet made of gold and silver and acacia
wood, to which were fitted three belts. Upon the outer
belt was Zeus with the thirty-six decatzi surrounding him ;
upon the second the twelve signs of the Zodiac were repre-
sented ; and upon the third the sun and moon. He set
the tablet upon a tripod, and then emptied out of a small
box upon it models of tho seven stars that were in the belts,
and put into the middle belt ei~ht precious stones ; these
he arranged in the places wherem he supposed the planets
which they represented would be at the time of the birth
Egypt
of Olympias, and then told her fortune from them. But
the use of the horoscope is much older than the time of
Alexander the Great, for to a Greek horoscope in the British
Museum is attached • an introductory letter from some
master of the art of astrology to his pupil, named Hermon,
urging him to be very exact and careful ih his application
of the laws which the ancient Egyptians, with their labori·
ous devotion to the art, had discovered and handed
down to posterity.' Thus we have good reason for as·
signing the birthplace of the horoscope to Eg}'l)t. In
connection with the horoscope must be mentioned the
" sphere "or " table " of Democritus as a means of making-
predictions as to life and death. In a magical papyrus
we are told to • ascertain in what month the sick man took
to his bed, and the name he received at hL'I birth. ·Calcu-
late the course of the moon, and see how many periods
of thirty days have elapsed ; then note in the table the
number of days left over, and if the number comes in the
upper part of the.table, he will live, but if in the lo\ver
part be will die.' "
Ghosts. The conception that the ka or double of man
\vandered about after death, greatly assisted the Eg}'l>tian
belief in ghosts.
" According to them a man consisted of a physical body,
a shadow, a double, a sou l, a heart, a spirit called the khu.
a power, a name, and a spiritual body. When the body
died the shadow departed from it, and could only be brought
back to it by the performance of a mystical ceremony ;
the double lived in the tomb with the body, and was ther6'
visited by the soul whose habitation was in heaven. The
soul was, from one aspect, a material thing, and like the
ka, or double, was believed to partake of the funeral offer-
ings which were brought to the tomb ; one of the chief
objects of sepulchral offerings of meat and drink was t~
keep the double in the tomb and to do away with the ne-
cessity of its wandering about outside the tomb in search
of food. It is clear from many texts that, unless the double
was supplied with sufficient food, it would wander forth
from the tomb and cat any kind of offal a11d drink any
kind of dirty water which it might find in its path. But
besides the shadow, and the double, and the souJ, the spirit
of the deceased, which usually had its abode in heaven,
was sometimes to bo found in the tomb. There is, how·
ever, good reason for stating that the immortal part of
man which Lived in the tomb and had its special abode
in the statue of the deceased was the • double.' This is
proved by the fact that a special part of the tomb was
reserved for the Ira, or double, which was called the' house
of the ka,' and that a priest, called the • priest of the ka,'
was specially appointed to minister therem."
Esoteric Knowledge ofthe Priesthood, The esoteric know-
ledge of the Egyptian priesthood is now believed to have
been of the description with which the Indian medicine
man is credited plus a philosophy akin to that of ancient
India. Says Davenport Adams :
" To impose upon the common peoyle, the priesthood
professed to lead lives of peculiar sanctity. They despised
the outer senses, as sources of evil and temptation. They
kept themselves apart from the profanium v"lgus, • and,'
.says Iamblicus, ' occupied themselves only with the know·
ledge of God, of themselves, and of wisdom ; they desired
no vain honours in their sacred practice, and never yielded
to the influence of the imagination.' Therefore they formed
a world within a world, fenced round by a singular awe
and wonder, apparently abstracted from the things of
earth, and devoted to the constant contemplation of divine
mysteries. They admitted few strangers into their order,
and wrapt up their doctrines in a hieroglyphieal language,
which was only intelligible to the initiated. To those
various precautions was added tnc solemnity of ~ terrible
Egyptian Masonry 137 Eleetrle Girls-
oath, whose breach was invariably punished with death."
" The Egyptian priests preserved the remaining relics
of the former wisdom of nature. These were not imparted
as the sciences are, in our age, but to all appearances they
were neither learned nor taught; but as a reflection of
the old revelations o( nature, the ~erception must arise
like an inspiration in the scholar's nund. From this cause
appear to have arisen those numerous preparations and
purifications the se\•erity of which deterred many from
initiation into the Egyptian priesthood ; in fact, not in-
frequently resl!lted in the scholar's death. Long fasting,
and the greatest abstinence, appear to have been particu-
larly necessary : besides this, the body was rendered in-
sensible through great exertions, and even through
voluntarily infiicted pain, and therefore open to the in-
fluence of the mind. Tile imagination was excited by
representations of the mysteries ; and the inner sense
was more impressed by the whole than-as is the case
with us-instructed by an explanation of simple facts.
In this manner the dead body of science was not given
over to the initiated, and left to chance whether it would
become animated or not. but the living soul of wisdom
was breathed into them.
" From this fact, that the contents of the mysteries
were rather revealed than taught-were received more
from inward inspiration and mental intoxication, than
outwardly through endless teaching, tt was necessary to
conceal them from the mass of the people.
So says Schubert, dealing with the same subject: " The
way to every innovation was closed, and outward know-
ledge and sc1ence could certainly not rise to a high degree
of external perfection ; but that rude sensuality, inclina-
tion for change and variety. was suppressed as the chief
source of all bodily and spiritual vices, is clear, as well as
that here, as in India, an ascetic and contemplative life
was recommended.
" They imparted their secret and divine sciences to no
one who did not belong to their caste, and it was long im-
possible for foreigners to le."\rn anything; it was only in
later times that a few strangers were permitted to enter
the initiation after many severe preparations and trials.
Besides this, their functions were hereditary, and the son
followed the footsteps of his father."
" Concerning that which passed within the temples,
and of the manner in which the sick were treated, we have
but fragmentary accounts; for to the uninitiated the
entrance was forbidden, and the initiated kept their vows.
Even the Greeks, who were admitted to the temples, have
been silent concerning the secrets, and have only here and
there betrayed portions. Jablonski says, • that but few
chosen priests were admitted into the sanctum, and that
admission was scarcely ever permitted to strangers even
under the ;;everest regulations.'"
Dealing with the subject of hypnotism in Egypt, M:ont-
f:\us;on says : " Magnetism was daily practised in the
temples of Isis, of Osiris, and Serapis. In these temples
the priests treated the sick and cured them, either by mag-
netic manipulation, or by other means producing som-
nambulism." Presenting a painting of a mesmeric scene,
he says : " Before a bed or table, on which lie the sick,
stands a person in a brown ~arment, and with open eyes, and
the dog's head of Anub1s. His countenance is turned
towards the sick person ; his left hand is placed on the
breast, and the right is raised over the heaa of his patient,
quite in the position of a magnctiser.

little pieces, and sew it in a knot, in a piece of a man's

Elder Tree : The elder had wonderful influence as n protect;on
against evil. Wherever it grew, witches were powerless_
In this country, gardens were protected by having eldeY
trees plan.ted at the entrance, and sometimes hedges of
this plant were trained round the garden. There arc very
few old gardens in country places in which are not still
seen remains of the protecting eldct' tree. " In my boy-
hood" says Napier," I remember that my brothers, sisters,
and myself were warned against breaking a twig or branch
from the eldet' hcuge which surrounded my grandfather's
garden. We were told at the time as a reasou for this
prohibition, that it was poisonous; but we discovered
afterwards that there was another reMon, viz., that it was
unluck]' to brea.k off even a small twig from a bourtree
bush." In some parts of the Continent this superstition
feeling is so strong that, before pruning it, the gardener
says : " Elder, elder, may I cut thy branches ? " lf no
response be heard, it is considered that assent has been
given and then, after spitting three times, the pruner be-
gins his cutting. According to Montanus, etdet' wood
formed a portion of the fuel used in the burning of human
bodies as a protection against evil influences ; and, the
drivers of hearses had their whip handles made of elder
wood for a similar reason. In some parts of Scotland,
peopb would not put a piece of elder wood into the fire,
and ~apier says " Pieces of this wood lying about unused
when the neighbourhood was in great straits for firewood;
but none would use it, and when asked why ? the answer
was: '· We don't know, but folks say it is not lucky to
burn the bourtrce." It \vas believed that children laid
in a cradle made wholly or in part of elcierwood, would
not sleep well, and were in dn.nger of falling out of the
cradle. Elder berries gathered' on St. John's Eve, would
prevent the possessor suffering from witchcraft, and often
bestowed upon him magical powers. li the elder were
planted in the form of a cross upon a new-made grave, and
if it bloomed, it was a sure sign that the soul of the dead
person was happy.

Electric Girls : Girls in whose presence certain phenomena
occurred, similar in nature to the time-honoured phenomena
of the poltergeist (q.v.), but ascribed to the action of some
new physical force, probably electricity. The best known
of these electd(; git'ls was perhaps Angelique Cottin, a Nor-
mandy peasant girl, whose phenomena were first observed
about 1846. Finally she was taken to Paris and placed
under the observation of Dr. Tanchon and others, who
testified to the actuality of the phenomena. These in-
cluded the movement of objects without contact, or at
a mere touch from Angeliq~·s petticoats, the agitation
in her presence of the magnetic needle, and the blowing
of a cold wind. Sht: was also able to distinguish between
the poles of a magnet at a touch. A commission appointed
by the Academy of Sciences, however, could observe no-
thing but the violent movements of her chair, which were
Electrobiolo~y 138
probably caused by muscular force. Other electric girls
practised about the same time, and even after the begin-
ding of the spiritualistic movement in America they were
occasionally heard of. They are worthy of note as a link
between the poltergeist and the spiritualistic mediuin.
Electrobiology : A mode of producing hypnotism by looking

Electrum : Amber is the subject of so:ne curious legends
under this name, but there is also a metallic electrum, known
to the French in modern times as Orbas. A cup of this

poison, by exh1biting certain semi-c1rcles like rainbows
in the liquor, which it also keeps sparkling and hissing as
if on the fire. A black species of electrum or amber is the
proper gal'gates of Pliny, and the jet of the present day.
The occult virtues of electrnm arc of the tell-tale character.
Elementary Spirits : The unseen intelligences who inhabit
the four elements, of the finest essence of which they are
composed. The creatures o£ the air are called sylphs ;
of the earth gnomes; of fire salamanders ; and of water,
nymphs or undincs. The best authority on the subject
is the Abbe de Villars, who published earlyin the eighteenth
century a short treatise entitled Comte de Gabalis, from
which a good deal of what follows is drawn. According
to this work the creatures of the clements were before the
Fall subject to Adam in all things, and we are led to under-
stand that by means of certain performances this ancient
communication may be restored, and that man may once
more have at his beck and call the elmuntary spi,its. The
Abbe gives a brief sketch of the nature of these peoples.
The air, be says, is .filled with a great number of beings
of human form, somewhat fierce in appearance, but really
of a docile nature. They are much interested in the
sciences, and are subtle, officious towards the sages, hostile
towards the foolish and the ignorant. Their wives ;:.nd
daughters are of a masculine type of beauty, such as is
depicted in the Amazons. The seas and nvers are in-
habited as well as the air, beings dwelling therein whom
the sages designated undines, or nymphs. Tho female
population much exceeds the male, the women being ex-
ceedingly beautiful, so that among the daughters of men
there is none to equal them. The earth is filled almost
to the centre with gnomes, people of small stature, the
guardians of subterrane:1n treasure, minerals and precious
stone~. They are ingenious, friendly towards men, and
easy to command. They provide tho children of the sages
with all the money they require, asking no other reward
for their services th:ln the glory of performing them. The
gnomides, their wives, are small of stature but very good·
looking, and they dress very curiously. As for the sala-
manders, the inhabitants of the region of fire, they set;ve
the philosophers, but are not over-anxious for their com-
pany, while their daughters and wives are rarely seen.
The1r women are very beautiful, beyond all the other
elementals, since they dwell in a purer element. Their
habits, mode of life, manners and laws are admirable,
and the attractions of their minds are greater even than
that of their persons. The Supreme Being they know
and religiously adore, but have no hope of eternal enjoyment
of Him, since their souls are mortal. True it is that, being
composed of the purest parts of the elements wherein they
dwell, and having no contrary qualities, they can live for
several centuries; yet are they much troubled because
of their mortal nature. It was, however, revealed to the
philosophers that an elenu11lary spirit could attain to im-
mortality by being united in marriage with a human being.
The children born of such unions are more noble and heroic
ihan the children of human men and women, and some
Elementary Spirits
of the greatest figures of antiquity- Zoroaster, Alexander,
Hercules, :VIerlin, to mention a few-are declared to have
been the children of elementary spirits.
The salamanders, the Comte de Gabalis goes on to say,
are composed of the most subtle particles of the sphere
of fire, con~lobatcd and organised by the action of the
Universal F1re, so called because it is the principle of all
the motions of nature. The sylphs are composed of the
purest atoms of the air; the nymphs, of the most delicate
particles of water; and the gnomes, of the finest essence
of earth. Adam was in complete accord with these crea-
tures because, being composed of that which was purest
in the four elements, be contained in himself the perfections
of these four peoples, and was their natural Icing. But
since by reason of his sin he had been cast into the excre-
ments of the elements, there no longer existed the harmony
between him, so impure and gross, and these fine and
ethereal substances. The Abtxl then gives a recipe whereby
the resultant state o£ things may be remedied and the
ancient correspondence restored. To attain this end we
must purify and exalt the element of tire which is within
us. All that is necessary is to concentrate the fire of the
world by means of concave mirrors, in a globe of glass.
There will then be formed within the globe a solary powder,
which, having purified itself !rom the admixture of"()ther
elements, becomes in a. very short time a sovereign means
of exalting the fire which is in us, and makes us, so to speak,
of an igneous nature. Thenceforward these creatures of
the fire become our inferiors, and, delighted at the restora-
tion of mutual harmony between themselves and the human
race, they will show towards man all the good·will theyhave
!or their own kind. Sylphs, gnomt:S, and nymphs are more
familiar with man than arc the salamanders, on account
of their shorter term of life, and it is therefore easier to
get into touch with them. To accomplish the restoration
of our empire over the sylphs, gnomes, or nymphs, we
must close a glass full of air, earth, or water, and expose
it to the sun for a month, at the end of which period its
various elements must be separated according to science.
This process is most easy in the case of water and earth.
" Thus," says the Comte, " without characters, without
ceremonies, without barbarous words, it is possible to rule
absolutely over these peoples." Other authorities pre-
scribe other means of obtamin$ dominion over the spirits
of the clements. Eliphas Lev1, for instance, states that
anyone desirous of subjugating the elcmentals must first
perform the four trials of antique initiation ; but as the
original trials are no longer known similar ones must be
substituted. Thus he who would control the sylphs must
walk fearlessly on the edge of a precipice, he who would
win the service of the salamanders must take his stand
in a burning building, and so on, the point of the ordeals
being that the man should show himself unafraid of the
elements whose inhabitants he desires to rule~ In medi.e-
val times the evocation and exorcism of elenzmtary spirits
was much practised, the crystal being a favourite means
of evoking them. The exorcism of earth is performed
by means of breathing, sprinkling of water, and burning
of incense, and the repetition o£ a formula of prayer to the
gnomes. Air is exorcised by breathing towards the four
cardinal points, and by the recital of prayers to the air-
spirits (sylphs). The casting of salt, incense, sulphur,
camphoJ', and white resin into a fire is declared efficacious
in the exorcism of that element. 'in the case of water,
breathing and laying on of bands, repetition of formul.e,
mixing of salt and ashes of incense, and other ceremonials
are to be observed. In every instance a special consecra-
tion of the four elements is a primary and essential part
of the proceedings.
As has been said, it is possible for a human being to
Elementary Spirits 139 Ell.Ii.r ot Life
confer immortality on an elementary spirit by the ceremony
of marriage. But this does not always occur ; sometimes
the reverse is the case, and the elementals share their mor-
tality with their human mate. In literature, at all events,
countless stories relate how men have risked and lost their
immortality by marrying a sylph or an undine. According
to the Comte de Gabalis, however, it would seem to be a
matter of choice whether a man cohfers his immortality
on his ethereal partner, or whether he partakes of her
mortal nature ; for it is ttlerein suggested that those who
have not been predestined to eternal happiness would do
well to marry with an elemental, and spare themselves
an eternity of woe.
Not every authority bas painted so attractive a picture
of the creatures of the elements as has the Abbe de Villars.
By some it is believed that there are numberless degrees
among these beings, the highest resembling the lowest
angels, while the lowest may often be mistaken for demons,
which, of course, they are not. Not only do multitudinous
variations of form and disposition characterise the elemen-
tals of our own planet; the other planets and the stars
are the abode of countless hosts of elementary spirits, dif-
fering from those of our world perhaps more than the
latter differ from one another. All the forms of beasts,
insects, and reptiles may be taken by the lower elementals,
as well as strange·combinations of the shapes of different
animals. The inhabitants of each element have their
peculiar virtues and vices ~vhich serve to distinguish them.
The sylphs are capricious and inconstant, but agile and
active; the undines, jealous and cold, but observant ;
the salamanders, hot and hasty, but energetic and strong ;
and the gnomes, greedy of gold and treasures; but never-
theless hard-working, good-tempered and patient. One
who would seck dominion over any of these must practise
their virtues ; but carefully avoid their faults, thus con-
quering them, as it were, on their own ground. Each
species can only dwell in its own proper element. Thus
a sylph may not invade the sphere of a salamander, or
vU:e versa, while both would be deci{!edly out of their ele-
ment in the regions of the nymphs or the gnomes. Four
rulers have been set over the four species-Gob, ruler of
the gnomes ; Paralda, of the sylphs ; Djin, of the sala-
manders ; and ~ecksa, of the nymphs. To the dwellers
in each element is assigned a point of the compass, where
lies their special kingdom. To the gnomes is given the
north ; to the salamanders, the south ; to the sylphs, the
east ; and to the undines, the west. The gnomes infiuence
those of a melancholic disposition, because they dwell in
the gloom of subterranean caverns. The salamanders
have an effect on those of sanguine temperament, because
their home is in the lire. The influence of the undines
is upon the phlegmatic, and of the sylphs upon those of
a bilious tempc.rament. Though as a rule they are invisible
to human eyes, they may on occasion become visible to
those who invoke them, to the sages and philosophers,
or even to the multitude. In the reign of king Pepin,
Zedekias suggested to the sylphs that they should appear
to men, whereupon the air was seen to be full of them,
sometimes ranged in battle, or in an aerial navy. It was
said by the people that they were sorcerers- an opinion
to which Charlemagne and Louis the Debonnairsubscribed,
the latter at least imposing heavy penalties on the supposed
sorcerers. So that they might behold their admirable in-
stitutions, certain men were raised up in the air, and while
descending were seen by their fellowmen on earth. The
latter regarded them as stragglers of the aerial army of
sorcerer$, and thought that they had come to poison the
fruits and fountains. These unfortunate persons were
thereupon put to death, along with many others suspected
of connection with the sorcerers.
To return to the consideration of the nature of these spirits,
we lind them collated in the Comic tk Gabalis with the
oracles of antiquity, and even with th-e classic pantheons
of Greece and Rome. Pan, for example, was the first
and oldest of the nymphs, and the news of his death, com-
municated by the people of the air to the inhabitants of
the waters, vtas proclaimed by them in a voice that "-as
heard sounding over all the rivers of Italy-" The great
Pan is dead ! " ).tr. A. E. Waite considers that the" angels"
evoked in medireval magic, as well as the " devils " of the
Sal-bath, were higher or lower elementals. Others may
see in the brownies and domestic spirits of folk-lore some
resemblance to the subjugated eleme>tlary spirit. Even
the familiar poltergeist, where- he docs not clearly establish
his identity as the spirit of a deceased person, may be re-
garded with propriety as an elemental. The Theosophists
use the word .. elemental " in a diaerent sense, to denote
the ·• astral remains " (See Shell) of one who has lived
an evil life on earth, and who is loath to leave the scene
of his pleasures. \Vith some occultists, again, " ele-
mental" really signifies a sub-human being, probably
identical with an eleme>tlary spirit, but of a mental and
moral status considerably lower than that of a human
bt>ing.

Elf Arrows: The superstitious riame given to triangular
flints, Belemnites, which are found in many countries, but
notably in ~cotland. It was be~eved that these stones
were arrows shot by the elves, which prove fatal tp cattle,
-the cure being to touch them with the arrow with which
they have been hit, and give them to drink of water in
which the arrow has been dipped. It is even on record
that an Irish bishop was thus shot at by an evil spirit;
and it is said that they are manufactured by the Devil
with the help of attendant imps who roughhew them, while
the Archfiend finishes the work. Cases are on record
where they have been known to be made and used by the
witches of Scotland within historic times. Similar super-
stitions regarding these remnants of the stone age prevail
in Italy, Africa, and Turkey.
Elf-Fire : The lg>tis fatuus, or " foolish lire." This is the
name given to fire obtained by rubbing two pieces of wood
together, and which is used in superstitious ways.
Amongst the Russian peasantry it is believed that these
wandering lights are the souls of still-born children, who
do not desire to lure people from the path, but who get
no rest until they lind their bodies.
Elixir of Life : No doubt exists that the medireval alchemists
and mystics believed that they were perfectly justified
in their search for the Elixir of Lif~. the universal medicine,
and the renewal of youth. This, with the quest for
gold, became the grand aim of alchemy, and although this
search may have had a psychical and mystical side, it most
certainly had a physical one. But there does not seem
to have been any standard method of accomplishing the
manufacture of the elixir. Thus in Petit Albert one is in-
structed to take Sibs. of sugar of mercury as the founda-
tion of such a mixture; while llernartl Trevisan believes
that the precipitation of the philosopher's stone into mer-
curial water results in the manufacture of the elixir. This
he states, will when elaborated to the Red, transmute
copper and other metals into pure gold, and if elaborated
to the White, will produce unalloyed silver.
But t he applicatiOn of the ~lixir to the prolongation of
life was undoubtedly the chief reason for its continued
search. The retired alchemist in his later years, wearied
with his quest for gold, craved the boon of youth and de-
sired renewed health and strength to assist him to carry
out his great purpose. As an illustration of the alchemical
Elixir of Life 140 Ellide
conception of the elixir of life, we quote the following from
a work dealing with the secret of rejuvenescence, originally
supposed to have been "Titten by Arnold de Villanova,
and published by Longueville-Harcourt at Paris in
1716:-
.. To renew youth is to enter once more into that felic-
itous season whlch imparts to the human frame the
pleasures and strength of the morning. Here it is to no
purpose that we should speak of that problem so much
discussed by the Wise, whether the art can be carried to
such a pitch of excellence that old age should itself be made
young. We koo'v that Paracelsus has vaunted the meta-
morphic resources of his Mercury of Life whlch not merely
rejuvenates men but converts metals into gold; He who
promised unto others the years of the sybils, or at least
the 300 winters of Nestor, himself perished at the a:ge Qf
thirty-seven. Let us turn rather to Nature, so admirable
in her achievements, and deem her not capable alone of
destroying what she bas produced at the moment she has
.begotten them. Is it possible that she will refuse unto
man, for whom all was created, what she accords to the
stags, the eagles, and the serpents, who do annually cast
aside the mournful concomitants of senility, and do assume
the most brilliant, the most gracious amenities of the most
joyous youth? Art, it is true, has not as yet arrived at
that apex of perfection wherefrom it can reilew our youth;
but that which was unachieved in the past may be accom-
plished in the future, a prodigy whlch may be more con-
fidently expected from the fact that in isolated cases it
has actually already taken place, as the facts of history
make evident. By observing and following the manner
in which nature performs such wonders, we may o.ssuredly
hope to execute this desirable transformation, and the
first condition is an amiable temperament, such as that
which was possessed by 1\Ioscs, of whom it is written t hat
for one hundred and twenty years his sight never failed
him.
" The stag. eagle, a11d sparrow-hawk renew their youth.
Aldrovandus has written on the rejuvenescence of the
eagle. Among the birds of the air, we are told by Pliny
that the raven and the phreoix live, each of them six hun-
dred years. ~o one denies that the stag is renewed by
feeding on vipers and serpents, while the apes of Caucasus,
whose diet is pepper, prove a sovereign remedy for the
lion, who grows young by devouring their 6esh. Those
who have written of the elephant maintain that his normal
li!e is extended through three centuries, while the horse,
which alone in creation participates in the natures of man,
of the lion, of the ox, the sheep, the mule, the stag, the
wolf, the fox, the serpent, and the hare, from each deriving
three of its qualities, has occasionally survived with un-
diminished Vlgour the lapse of a hundred years. The
serpent, who is instrumental in the rejuvenescence of the
stag, himself renews his youth at the shedding of his scales,
from all which considerations, it follows that it is not be-
yond belief that a like prodigy may be found in the su-
perior ordet of the same productions whence man has been
himself derived, for man is assuredly not in a worse con-
dition than the beasts whom he rules."
Trithemius (q.v.) on his death-bed dictated a receipt
which he said would preserve mind, health and memory
"'-ith perfect sight and hearing. for those who ma-de use
of it. It consists of among other things, calomel, gentian,
cinnamon, aniseed, nard, coral, tartar, mace, and five
grammes of it \vere to be taken night and morning in wine
or brodium during the whole of the first month, during
the second month, in the morning only; during the third
month thrice in the week, and so continuing through life.
This is a more understandable receipt than that of En-
genius Philalethes, who says: " Ten parts of ccelestiall
slime; separate the male from the female, and each after-
wards from its own earth, physically, mark you, and with
no violence. Conjoin after separation in due, harmonic
vitall proportion; and straightwa}•. the Soul descending
from lh,e. pyroplastic sphere, shall restore, by a mirific
e:nbrace, 1ts dead and deserted body. Proceed according
to the Volcanico magica theory, till they are el{alted into
the Fifth :\letaphysical Rota. This is that world-renowned
medicine, whereof so many have scribbled, which, not-
withstanding, so few ha,·e known."
In his Hi$lory of Magic Eli(>has Levi gives Cagliostro's.
great secret of rejuvenescence m the following terms:
" Let us now turn to the secret of r·hysical regeneration
to attain which--according to the occult prescription
of the Grand Copht-a retreat of forty days. after the
manner of a jubilee, must be made once in every fiftyyears,
beginning during the full moon of .May in the company
of one faithful person only. It must be also a fast of forty
days, drinking !llay-de\\~collected from sprouting corn
with a cloth of pure white linen-and eating new and ten-
der herbs. The repast should begin \l-ith a large glass of
dew and end '~-ith a biscuit or crust of bread. There should
be slight bleeding on the seventeenth <!ay. Balm of Azoth
should then be taken morning and C\'Cning, beginning
with a dose of six drops and increasing by two drops daily
till the end of the thirty-second day. At the dawn which
follows thereafter rene~ the slight bleeding ; then take
to your bed and remain in it till the er.d of the fortieth
day.
·· On the first awakening after the bleeding, take the
first grain of Universal Medicine. A swoon of three hours
\vill be followed by convulsions, sweats ar.d much purging,
necessitating a change both of bed and linen. At this
stage a broth of lean beef must be taken, seasoned \l-ith
rice, sage, valerian, vervain and balm. On the day follow-
ing take the second grain of Universal Medicine, whlch is
Astral Mercury combined with Sulphur of Gold. On the
next day have a warm ooth. On the thirtr-sixth day
drink a glass of Egyptian wine, and on the thirty-seventh
take the third and last grain of Universal ~ledicine. A
profound sleep will follow, during which the hair, teeth,
nails and skin will be renewed. The prescription for the
thirty-eighth day is another warm bc.th, steeping aromatic
herbs in the water, of the same kind as those specified for
the broth. On the thirty-ninth day drink ten drops of
Elixir of Acharat in two spoonsful of red \l-ine. The work
will be finished on the fortieth day, and the aged man will
be renewed in youth.
.. By means of this jubilary regimen, Cagliostro claimed
to have lived for many centuritl>. It ''-ill be seen that it
is a'. variation of the famous Bath of Immortality in use
among the Menandrian Gnostics."
Aristeus is stated to have left to hi.s disciples a secret
which rendered all metals diaphanous, and man immortal.
The process would appear to consist in a mystic treatment
of the atmosphere, which is to be congealed and distilled
until it develops the divine sparkle, and subsequently
becomes liquified. It is then subjected to heat and under-
goes several other processes. when the elixir emerges.
There is surprisingly little literature upon the subject
of the Elixir of Life. But a more prolonged notice on the
subject will be found under the article ·• Philosopher's
stone" (q.v.).

When its wings were outspread, it could skim the calmest

Eloge de l' Enfer : A critical, historical, and moral work,
an edition of which was published at The Hague in 1759.
It is very satirical, very heavy, and somewhat lacking in
wit..
Elongation : The phenomenon of elongaJitm is a fairly common
one at spiritualiscc st:ances. It may be described as a
stretching out of the medium's body, till his height is in-
creased by from three inches to nearly a foot. The feat
is ascribed to spirit agencies. There are accounts hy
witnesses of standing in the social and scientific world of
elongaJions of Herne, Home, Morse. and other well-known
mediums. These manifestations usually made their ap-
pearance only when the light was low, but there were
several exceptions. In describing an elongation of Home,
Lord Lindsay says: " Home looked as if he was pulled
up by the neck, the muscles seemed in a state of te:lSion.
He stood firmly upright in the middle of the room, and
before the elo11gation commenced I placed my foot on his
instep." The same witness also declares that the increase
in Home's height on this occasion was eleven inches. Most
accounts describe a violent swaying motion on the part
of the medium as preceding the elongation, which some
critics have regarded as a convenient mode of covering
the usc of mech:~onism, which might be concealed in the
medium's boots.
Elymas, the Soreerer : A magician of Paphos, in Cyprus,
who openly defied the apostle Paul before the Ro=n
governor. The latter, who did not know whether to credit
Paul or Elymas, summoned them both before him, wi:J.t:.n
the apostle suffered the indignity referred to. " Oh, full
of all subtlety and mischief," said Paul, in righteous anger,
" child of the devil, enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou
not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord ? And,
now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou
Sh'llt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season." It is not
relate.! in what m:mner Elymas exercised his talents, or
what were the characteristics of his sorceries, but we are
told that the sentence of Paul immediately took effect,
and " there fell on him a mist and a darkness ; and he
went about, seeking some to lead him by the hand."
E manations: Variously defined as subtle fluid, astral in-
flue::~ce, psychic force, physical effluence, magnetism, ra-
diations and vibrations. They are said to proceed from
and surround all bodies and objects in nature, and when
brought into contact through this medium, influencing
and re-acting on each other, the result being either inter-
penetration or repulsion. The attractive properties of
the magnet were known to the ancients, some authorities
claiming that it was used in their religious rites and mysteries,
in Egypt, Greece and Rome. They adduced as evidence the
iron rings and wings used in the Samothracian mysteries,
the iron wings worn by the priests of Jupiter to increase
their m:1.gical power, and in the various symbols ascribed
to the pagan gods. It is said too that meteoric stones,
because of their supposed radiation of force, were also
made use of in the religious rites, either being worshipped,
or employed for purposes of divination and soothsayina.
Small ones were worn by the priests and Pliny tells of the
temple of Arsinoe wttich was vaulted with magnetic stone
i~ order to receive a hoveringstatueof its patron. Cedrenus
g1ves an account of an ancient image in the Serapium at
Alexandria being suspended by magnetic force.
The most ancient writing extant in wttich this theory
of emanations may be traced is ascribed to Timreus of Locris
in which he ascribes the creation of the universe to the
divine emanatio11s of God, an imparting of His being to
unformed matter. By this union a world-soul was created
which vitalises and regulates all things. Claudian in his
.Emanations
Idyl of the Mag11et uses it as a symbol of the informative
spirit of things. the laws of nature, creative and existent.
The mysticism of the seventeenth and ei~hteenth cen-
turies mainly depends on these ideas of rad1ations eman-
ating from all things but especially the stars, magnets
and human beings. of a force which would act on all things
and was controlled by the indwelling spirit. The writings
of Paracelsus abound with instances of the theory. He
asserts that every substance in itself contains something
of the nature of the loadstone ; that the astral light, which
is one of the finer media of nature, finer than the lumin-
iferous ether, exists throughout planetary space especially
around the brain and spinal cords of human beings ; (See
article Aura) that we are all but organised magnets having
each our poles which attract and repel ; that our thoughts
are magnetic emanations escaping frotu our brains. His
theory of the universe was that it emanated from a great
first Being and there wa.
~ a reciprocity in all things. In
man too there exists an a.~tral quality, emanating from
the stars, which, whether physical or not, when compared
\vith the physical body may be considered a spirit. This
life stands in connexion with the stars from which it sprang
and draws to it their power like a magnet. He calls
this Sidereal life the magncs microcosmi and makes use of
it to explain the manifestations of nature-it glows in
the fiower, glides in the stream, moves in the ocean and
shines in the sky. Van Helmont speak"S of an ethereal
spirit, pure and living, which pervades all things. Robert
Fludd explained sympathy and antipathy by the action
of the emanatory spheres surrounding man-in sympathy
the emanations proceeding from the centre, in antipathy
the opposite movement taking place. He maintained
that these sensitive emanatio1:s arc to be found also amongst
animals and plants, drawing an argument from the fact
that if dead and inert substances, such as the earth and
ma!(net seem to be, should have their ema11ations and their
poles, their living forms must needs have them Likev.>ise.
In the writings of Maxwell, a Scotch physician, is to be
found the statement: " There is a hoking together of
spirits, an incessant outpouring of the rays of our body
into another." Athanasius Kircher elaborated the theory
deriving all natural phenomena from the action of magnetic
radiation ; the arts and sciences being also emanations.
\Virdig, Bartholin and many more pursued and developed
their philosophical investigations along these lines.
Descartesasserted that allspaceis filled with a tluid matter
which he held to be elementary, the foundation and fountain
of all life, enclosing all globes and keepin~ them in motion.
In Newton's doctrine of attraction, which he called the
Di·.rine Sensorium, the idea of emanation and magnetism
is found. The following quotation is from his Ftmdamen-
tal Principles of Natural Philosophy: " Here the question
is of a very subtle spirit which penetrates through all, even
the hardest bodies and which is concealed in their substance.
Through the strength and activity of this spirit, bodies
attract each other and adhere together when brought into
conta{;t. Through it electrical bodies operate at the re-
motest distances as well as near at hand, attracting and
repelling ; through this spirit the light also .flows and is
refracted and reflected and warms bodies." Mesmer
enunciated the following propositions: " Between the
heavenly bodies, the earth and human beings, there exists
a mutual or interchangeable influence. The medium of
this influence is an universally distributed fluid which
suffers no vacuum, is of a rarity with which nothing can
compare and has the property of receiving and tro>.nsmit·
ting all impressions of movement. Animal bodies ex-
perience the mutual effect of this agent, because it
penetrates the nerves and affects them directly. In the
human body particularly are observed properties analagous
Emanations 142 Emanations
to those of the magnet. It is shown by experiment that
a matter flows out so line that it penetrates all bodies
without apparently losing any of its activity. This may
be communicated to other bodies, animate or inanimate,
such as mirrors; it is communicated, propagated, aug-
mented by sound. Its virtues may be accumulated,' con-
centrated and transported." On this theory he based
his famous " Animal Magnetism" (q.v.) and its practice
for the cure of disease, in fact all human ailments. Baron
von Reichenbach, a mao ofscientific attainments, a chemist
and metallurgist of some repute, conducted a series of
experiments to investigate this theory. He procured
the aid of a large number of sensitives, clairvoyants and
mediums. These persons he placed in dark rooms, and
then submitted to their spiritual sight magnets, shells,
crystals, minerals, animals, human bands and a great
variety of animate and inanimate objects, known only
to himself but detected by the sensitives through the lu-
minous emanations given fOJ;th by each substance. These
emattalions or flames differed in colour, size ar.d intensity
according to the nature of the obj cct examined. The
sensations experienced seemed mainly of two kinds-
temperature and perceptions of light and colour. The
poles of the magnet emitted flames, reddish yellow from
the south pole, bluish green from the north ; a similar
polarity was observed in the luminous emanations from
crystals. The human tin~ers radiated light. Element.:rry
substances each had the1r distinctive light and colour.
the metals giving the most vivid impressions. Iron, cop·
per, bismuth, mercury and others gave off a red glow,
each differing from the others ; the fiames emitted by
lead, cobalt and palladium were blue; those of silver,
gold, cadmium, d1amond were white. The clairvoyants
also perceived the luminous matter over the bodies of the
sick in hospitals; and a column of misty vapour hovering
over a newly made grave. This radiance emitted by the
various substances, was capable of illuminating other
objects. It could be concentrated by a lens, reflected
by a mirror but produced no effect on a thermometer and
was liable to be absorbed by the glass of the percipient's
spectacles. A large number of the sensitives fully cor-
roborated each other's statements and observations, two
artists amongst them sketching their clairvoyant '-isions.
These experiments of the Baron's were conducted for years
with the most perse,·ering attention and he arrived at the
conclusion that from every object in the human, animal,
vegetable and mineral I..-ingdom there emanated a force
which could be detected under favourable conditions as
flames l'r luminous radiations. Some obsen·ers defined
these as the uni,·crsal life of things. Reichenbach in his
writings and descriptions of the experiments called them
the " Od Force" or " Odyle." Modern Spiritualism
claims that all physical phenomena such as materialisa-
tions, (q.v.) levitllhOn, (q.v.) apports, (q.v.) table-rapping
etc. arc produced by the spirits' manipulations of the
medium's more phys1cal emanations in such a way as to
give them power to manifest materially and control matter.
The finer phases of mcdiumship are traced to a similar
use of the psychic aura or force emitted from the medium's
personality. Theosophy has elaborated the theory of
cma11utions into grandiose conceptions of astral light, in-
fluenccs,auras, etc. In Paris, in 1901, a peculiar phenom-
enon produced through the agency of a young Roumanian
gentleman was investigated by Dr. Rozier. Broussay
could occasion a gaseous bubbling of water when this was
enclosed in a bottle and over this ebullition he had more
or less control. In Dr. Rozier's presence this was carried
out by the following process. A white glass bottle was
taken, a quarter filled with water, and the neck of this
was firmly closed up by Broussay's hand. It was then
turned upside down and held ti~htly so that no moisture-
could possibly escape. On watchmg the water thus brought.
into touch with the band minute air bubbles formed rap-
idly and rose in threadlike lines to the surface. After
lapse of a minute or two the appear;'lnce intensified and
the hubb!es rose in greater number until the effect resembled
soda water in effervescncc. When the experiment was.
at its height the bubbles seemed to fly from every part
of the hand which was exposed to the water and gathered
round the neck of the bottle while a crackling sound was
audible. Light had no effect on the experiment and the
temperature of M. Brouss11y was normal, 3ideg. to 38deg.
at most. This experiment is similar to a favourite per-
formllnce given by Indian jugglers, who will boil an egg
in from live to ten minutes at most without tire to heat
the water. An explanation of this phenomenon is given
as being due to the electric vibration~ passing along the
surface of the skin and raising the temperature of the water
above boiling point-the definition of electricity in this
case being that as it is neither matter nor energy, though
energy may be expended in moving or creating it, it·is
quite probably generated by the brain cells, a manifestation
of cerebral force and will vibrations. Later investigations
in the suhject of emanations were set in motion by certain
results detected in connection with a study of the famous
" X " r;~.ys, when it was round that a new species of radia-
tions was emitted by the focus tube, which traversed al-
uminium, black paper, wood, etc. These new rays were
plane-polarized from the moment of their cmissicn ; were
susceptible of rotatory and elliptic pol,..rization and could
be refracted, reflected and diffused. The wave-lengths of
the " N" rays arc much smaller thu.n thosl' of light and
they also appear to be without beat. They can be obtained
from various sources other than the Rontgen tube, and
certain bodies seem to have the property of retaining or
storing the rays for a considerable time. The human
body is said to emit them unceasingly. Though non-
luminous in thcm~elves the rays will, if allowed to fall upon
a phosphorescent body, increase its glow. A small spark
or flame is similarly influenced. In photography the
ex-istence of the •· N " rays is well demonstrate-d, those
pictures taken without the rays being very faint while
those obtained while the •· ~" ra\S were in action were
much !>tronger. Pebbles exposed to sunlight spontar.cously
emit •· N " rays and bodies such as Rupert's drops, hard-
ened steel, hammered brass, etc, are permanent sources
of the rays. These rays were named after the initial letter
of the town of Nancy where the rl'Scarches were made that
led to their discovery by Professor Hlondlot. Further
experiments prcved that all matter posse!:seS' the power
of radiation and tbosr. potentialities can be seen and regis-
tered by a fluorescent screen just as tho~e of the animal
and human organism. \Vhenever muscular and nerve
energies are manifesting rays are emitted, and it was found
that they would pass through certain S\tbstances whereas
others would intercept and store them. For example,
they passed through an oak board three or four centimetres
thick, black paper, aluminium, etc, but water stopped
them or even a cigarette paper if wet. Fresh water inter-
cepted them but if the liquid were salt the rays passed
through. Dr. Baraduc for many years pursued his studies
in the emission of human fluidic forces and used the bio-
metre for registering vibrations emitted from human bodies.
This instrument consists of a needle suspended by a line
thread and covered v:ith a glass shade. When the band
appro11ches this shade, without touching it the needle is
defiected. As the result of ion!:" observation he formed
the opinion that the variations 1n the movements of the
needle were caused by various conditions, physical, mental
and moral in the persons who approached it and that by
Emerald 143 England
these means he was able to estimate those conditions.
Dr. Baraduc also experimented in photography on these
lines. He took photographs of thl' emanations given off from
the hands of persons in \':tried, mental, moral and physical
states. In these the lines of radi:\tion varied considerably.
In one, described by him as a psychic hand, the luminosity
seemed to radiate from the lower base of the palm; an-
other, where all the lines were confusG~, was a photograph
taken from the hand of a man in mental distress. Dr.
Baraduc also photo~raphed some stones which were said
to have been used Ill the initiation rites of pre-Chri:tian
religions and the stream of rays emanating from these
stones was distinctly visible on the plates; also some holy
water at Lourdes just after a miraculous cure had been
effected, and there again the influence was strong. He
photographed with similar result the sacred wafer during
the moment of elevation in a Roman Catholic Church.
He also photographed both hi~ son and his wife, the one
four minutes after death and the other twenty-four hours
after death, and in each instance there was seen stretching
from the lifeless body a ~reat stream of force which ex-
tended right up to the ceiling of the room and then turned
down again. In the one case .the face of the son could be
recognised by anyone who ha<l known him and could be
seen close to the body. In the other case the profile of
Dr. Baraduc's wife was to be seen halfway up the room.

Enchiridioo of Pope Leo, The: Is a collection of charms.
cast in the form of prayers, which have nothing in common
with those of the Church. It is concerned chiefly with
worldly, rather than spiritual advantages. It was per-
haps printed at Rome in 1523, and again in 1606. Its
magical virtue rests on a supposed letter from Charlemagne
to Pope Leo, in which he states that since receiving the En-
chiridiotl he has never ceased to be fortunate. The charms
it contains arc supposed to be effectual against all the
dangers to which human flesh is heir-poison, fire, wild
beasts and tempests. When a copy of the book has been
secured, it must be placed in a small bag of leather, carried
on the person, and one page at least read daily. The
reading must be done upon the knees with the face turned
to the east, and works of piety must be performed in honour
of the celestial spirits, whose inftuence it is desired to at-
tract. The first chapter of the Gospel according to St.
John is declared to be the most potent in the book. As
for the symbols, they are mostly of oriental origin. It
also includes the mysterious prayers of Pope Leo, and
certain conjurations of a semi-magical character, including
the seven mysterious orisons, which arc merely clumsy
imitations of the Roman ritual.

Endless Cord, Tying Knots In : About the years r877-88
Professor Zollner of Leipsic investigated the phenomena
of the medium Slade, and particularly anyth.ing wh.ich
might prove a fourth dimension of space, in which hypoth-
esis Professor Zollner was at that time greatly interested.
The tying in an endless cord of such knots as could or-
dinarily only be made if the ends of the cord were free
provided such a test. In December, 1877, Zollner visited
Slade with two pieces of hempen cord, the free ends of each
being scaled to a piece o( cardboard. To ensure the cord
always being in sight Zollner hung it round his neck, and
kept Slade's hands continually in view. Under these cir-
cumstances four knots were produced, apparently on the
original scaled cord.
England : (For the pre-S:~.xon inhabitants of England, See
Celts.) The An~lo-Saxon system of magic was of course
Teutonic. Their pretenders to witchcraft were called
wicca, sci>z·lrteca, .t:aldoY·craeftig, wiglaer, and llWYihwyrtha.
Wiglaer is a combination from wig, an idol or a temple,
and laer, learning. He was the wizard, as wicca was
the witch. Scinlaeca was a species of phantom or
apparition, and was :1.lso used as a name of the
person who had the power of producing such things: it
IS, literally, .. a shining dead bo<ly." GaldoY-craeftig im-
plies one skilled in incantations ; and mortlt-wyYlha is,
literally, ·· a worshipper of the dead."
Another general appell:1.tion for such personages was
dry, a magician.
The laws visited these practices with penal severity.
The best account that can be given of them will be found
in the passages proscribing them.
'· If any wicca, or wiglaer, or false swearer, or mortll-
wyrtfta, or any foul, contaminated, manifest horcwenaJZ
(whore, quean or strumpet), be any where in the land,
man shall drive them out." .. We teach that every priest
shall extinguish all heathendom, and forbid wilwcorthunga
(fountain-worship), and licwigtunga (incantations of the
dead), and ltwaia (omens), and galdra (magic), and man-
worship, and the abominations that men exercise in various
sorts of witchcraft, and in frithspottum, and ·with elms and
other trees, and with stones. and with many phantoms."
From subsequent regulations, we find that these prac-
tices were made the instruments of the most fatal mis-
chief; for penitentiary penalties are enjoined if any one
should destroy another by wicc;e craefte ; or if any should
"drive sickness on a man"; or if death should follow
from the attempt.
They seem to have used philtres; for it is also made
punishable if any should use witchcraft for another's love,
or should give him to cat or to drink with magic. They
were also forbid to wiglian (or to divine) by the moon.
Canute renewed the prohibitions. He enjoined them not
to worship the sun or the moon, fire or floods, wells or
stones, or any sort of tree ; uot to love wiccecrae{t. or frame
death-spells, either by lot or by torch ; nor to effect any
thing by phantoms. From the Poenitentiate of Theodore
we also learn, that the po,,.er of letting loose tempests was
also pretended to.
Another name for magical arts amohg the Anglo-Saxons
was unlybban wyrce, ··destructive of life." The penitence is
prescribed for a woman who kills a man by unlybban. One
instance of philtre using is detailed to us. A woman re-
solving on the death of her step-son, or to alienate from
him his father's affection, sought a witch, who knew how
to change minds by arts and enchantments. Addressing
such a one ....oith promises and rewards, she enquired how
the mind of the father might be turned from the child,
and be fixed on herself. The magical medicament was
immediately made, and mixed with the husband's meat
and drinlc. The catastrophe of the whole was the murder
of the child and the discovery of the crime by the as-
sistant, to revenge the step-mother's ill-treatment.
The charms used by the Anglo-Saxons were innumerable.
They trusted in their magical incantations for the cure
of disease, for the success of their tillage, for the discovery
of lost property. and for the prevention of casualties. ·
Specimens of their charms for these purposes still remain
to us. Bede tells us. that " many, iu times of disease
(neglecting the sacraments) went to the erring medicaments
England 144 England
of idolatry, as if to restrain God's chastisements by incan-
tations, phylacteries, or any other secret of the demoniacal
arts."
Their prognostications, from the sun, from thunder,
and from dreams, were so numerous, as to display and to
perpetuate superstition. Every day of every month was
ea.talog\Jed as a propitious or unpropitious season for cer-
tain transa'Ctions. \Ve have Anglo-Saxon treatises which
contain rules for discovering the future and disposition
of a child, from the day of its nativity. One day was
useful for all things ; another, though good to tame animals
was baleful to sow seeds. One day was favourable to the
commencement of business ; another to let blood ; and
{)thers wore a forbidding aspect to these and other things.
On this day one must buv, on a second sell, on a third
hunt, on a fourth do nothing. If a child was born on
such a day, it would li~e; if on another, its life would be
sickly; if on another, he would perish early. In a word,
the most alarming fears, and the most extravagant hopes,
were perpetually raised by these foolish superstitions,
which tended to keep the mind in the dreary bondage of
ignorance and absurdity, which prevented the growth of
knowledge, by the incessant war of prejudice, and the
slavish effects of the most imbecile apprehensions.
The same anticipations of futurity were made by no-
ticing on what day of the week or month it first thundered,
<>r the new moon appeared. or the new-year's day occurred.
Dreams likewise had regular interpretations and applica-
tions ; and thus life, inatead of being governed by counsels
of wisdom, was directed by those solemn lessons of gross
superstition, which the most ignorant peasant of our days
would be ashamed to avow.
Althou~h witchcraft was of early origin in E11gland, we
do not find many notices of it in the literature of the coun-
try, nor does it seem to have been systematically punished
until past Reformation times. That is not to say, that
no prosecution ever took ~lace against witchcraft in Plan-
tagenet and early Tudor times, but that in all probability
the vogue of sorcery was so widespread, and so powerful
was su;>posed to be the protection of a Church that nothing
like a crusade was directed against it. Again it was re-
garded a~ a political offence to employ sorcery against
the ruling powers, and "·~ such it was punished severely
enoU!;h, a<; is witnessed by the execution of the Duchess
of Gloucester in Henry Vl.'s rci~n. and the Duke of Buck-
ingham in 1521. In Heary Vl.'s time Lord Hungerford
was beheaded for consulting certain soothsayers concerning
the duration of the King's life.
L. S.
According to Sir William Blackstone, " To deny the
possibility, nay, the actual existence of witchcraft and
sorcery is at once fiatly to contradict the revealed ''lord
of God in various passages of the Old and New Testaments,
and the thing itself is a truth to which every nation in the
world hath in its turn borne testimony.''
At very early periods the Church fulminated against
those who practised it. In 696 a Canon of Council held
at Berl<hampstead condemned to corporal punishment
those who made sacrifices to evil spirits; and at subsequent
dates Statutes against \Vitchcraft were enacted by the
Parliaments of Henry Vlll., Elizabeth and James I. Mr.
Inderwick says, "For centuries in this country strange
as it may now appear, a denial of the existence of such
demoniacal agency was deemed equal to a confession of
Atheism and to a disbelief in the Holy Scriptures them-
selves. But not only did Lord Chancellors, Lord Keepers,
benches of Bishops and Parliament attest the truth and
the existence of witchcraft, but Addison writing as late
ao; 171r, in the pages of the Spectator, after describing him-
self as hardly pressed by the arguments on both sides of
this question expresses his own belief that there is and has
been, witchcraft in the land."
. It is in the twelfth Century that a first distinct glimpse
IS obtained of the bond between the Evil Otte and his vic-
tim. The tale of the old woman of Berkeley' which
S<>uthey•s Ballad has familiarised, is related by William
of Mal.mesbury on the authority of a professed eye-witness.
When the devil informed the witch of the near expiry of
her contract, she summoned the neighbouring monks and
her children, and after confessing h<:1: criminal compact
displayed great anxiety lest Satan should secure her body
as well as her soul. She gave directions to be sewn in a
stag's hide and placed in a stone coffin, shut in with lead
and iron, to be loaded with heavy stones and the whole
fastened down with three iron chains. In order to bafile
the power of the demons, she further directed fifty psalms
to be sung by night, and fifty masses to be sung by day,
and that at the end of three nights, if her body was still
secure, she said that it might be buried with safety. All
these precautions however, pro,•ed of no avail. The monks
bravely resisted the efforts of the fiends on the first and
second nights, but on the third night in the middle of a ter-
rific uproar an immense 4emon burst into the monastery
and in a voice of thunder commanded the dead witch to
rise. She replie<l that she was bound with chains, which
however the demon snapped like thread, the coffin lid fell
aside, and on the witch arising the demon bore her off on
a huge black horse and galloped into the darkness. while
her shrieks resounded through the air. The nrst trial for
witchcraft in England occurred during the tenth year of
the reign of King John, when according to tbe A bbreviato-
Plar.iloYum, the wife of Ado the merchant, accused one
Gideon of the crime. He proved his innocence however,
by the ordeal of the red-hot iron. A trial was reported
with more detail in the year 1324. Certain citizens of
Coventry had suffered at the bands of•the prior whose
extortions were ap~roved of and supported by two of
Edward H.'s favountes. By way of revenge they plotted
the death of the prior, the favourites, and the King.
In order to carry this into effect they consulted John
of Nottingham, a famous Magician of the time. and his
servant Robert.:.\'larshall of Leicester. Marshall however,
betrayed the plot and stated that together with his master
they fashioned images of wax to represent the King, his
two favourites, the prior, his caterer and steward, and one
Richard de Lowe-the latter being brought in merely as
an experimental lay-figure in which to test the effect of
the charm. At an old ruined house near Coventry. on
the Friday following Holy Cross Day, John gave his man
a sharp pointed leaden branch and commanded him to
plunge it into the forehead of the figure representing Rich-
ard de Lowe. This being done John dispatched his servant
to Lowe's house to fmd out the result of the experiment.
Lowe it seems had lost his senses and went about screaming
" Harrow." On the Sunday before Ascension john with-
drew the branch from the image's forehead, and thrust
it into the heart, where it remained till the follo-.ving Wed-
nesday when the unfortunate victim died. Such was the
evidence of Marshall, but t he judges gave it little belief,
and after several adjournments the trial was aban-
doned.
The first enactment against witchcraft in England was
by the Parliament of 1541. I n 1551 furth~r enactments
were levelled at it, but it was not until 1562 that Parlia-
ment defined witchcraft as a Capital Crime. T henceforth
followed the regular persecutionn of Witches. Many
burnings occurred during the latter years of Elizabeth's
reign.
At the village of Worboise, (q.v.) in the County of Hunt-
ingdon in 1589 dwelt two country gentlemen, Robert
·England 145
Throgmorton and Sir Samuel Cromwell. Mr. Throg-
morton's family consisted of his wife and fiv.e daughters
of whom the eldest Joan, a girl of fifteen was po~sessed
with a mind and imagination well stocked with ghost-
and witch-lore. On one occasion she had to pass the cot-
tage of a labouring family of the name of Samuel. This
family consisted of a man, his wife, and their grown-up
daughter. Mother Samuel was sitting at the door wearing
a black cap, and busily engaged in knittin~. Jo3n declared
that she was a witch, ran home and fell 1nto strange con-
vulsive fits, stating that Mother Samuel had bewitched
her. In due course t.he other daughters respectively were
attacked with similar fits, and attributed the blame to
Mother Samuel. The parents now began to suspect that
their children were really bewitched and reported the
matter to Lady Cromwell. who, as an intimate friend of
the family took the matter up and along with Sir Samuel
Jrdered that the alleged witch should be put to !lrdeal.
Meanwhile the children let loose their imagination and
invented all sorts of weird and grotesque tales about the
old woman. Eventually Throgmorton had the poor old
woman dragged to his grounds where she W:lS subjected
to torture, pins be1ng thrust into her body to see if blood
could be drawn. Lady Cromwell tore out a handful of
the old crone's hair which she gave to l\:lrs. Throgmorton
requesting her to burn it as an antidote against witchcraft.
Suffering under these injuries the old woman invoked a
curse against her torturers which w~ afterwards remem-
bered, though shew~~ allowed her liberty. She thereafter
suffered much persecution at the hands of the two families,
all ills and misfortunes occurring amongst their cattle and
stock being laid to her charge. Eventually Lady Crom-
well was seized with an illness that caused her death, and
upon old Mother Samuel wa.'l laid the responsibility. Re-
peated efforts were made to persuade her to co:tfess and
amend what she had done. At last, tormented beyond
endurance, she let herself be persuaded to pronounce an
exorcism against the spirits and confessed that her husband
and daughter were also associates with her and had sold
themselves to the devil. On the strength of this confession
the whole family were imprisoned in Huntingdon Gaol.
At the following Sessio:l the three Samuels were put upon
trial indicted w1th various offences and " bewitching unto
d'!ath" the Lady Cromwell. In the agony of torture the
old woman confes~ed all that was req•Jirecl, but her husband
aotl daughter strongly asserted their innocence. All were
sentenced to be hanged and burned. The executions were
carried out in April 1595.
It is related that in 1594 the Earl of Derby attributed
the cause of his death to witchery, though he hacl no idea
of the person who had bewitched him.
The Accession of James I. himself a great expert in
witchcraft and the author of the famous treatise on de-
monology (q.v.) gave a great impetus to the persecution
of witches in E1zgland. " Poor old women and girls of
tender age were walked, sworn, shaved, and tortured, the
gallows creaked and the fires blazed."
In 1606 there were tried at King's Lr.nn the wife of one
Henry Smith a grocer, for cun:.ing a satlor who had struck
a boy, and for cursing her neighbours bec~use they were
more prosperous in their trades than she was.
After hl'
.aring the most absurd evidence she was con-
victed and sentenced to death. Upon the scaffold she
confessed to various acts of witchcraft.
In 1633 arose the famous case of the Lancashire \Vitches
(q.v.). On the assertion of a boy called Robinson, that
he had been carried o:fl and witnessed a witches' Sabbath
at the Hoare Stones, some eighteen women were brought
to trial at Lancaster Assizes.
As the result of the sevl're legislation against Ylitchcraft,
England
there arose a class of self-constituted impugners ot witch-
finders who to their personal advantage were the means
of the sacrifice of many innocent lives.
The most famous of these witch-finders was Matthew
Hoplcins of Manningtree, in Essex. He assumed the title
of " ''~~itch-finder General," a11d with an assistant, and a
woman whose duty was to examine female suspects for
devil's marks, be travelled about the Counties of Essex,
Sussex, Huntingdon, and Norfolk. In one year this mur-
derer- for want of a better name-caused the death of
sixty people. His general test was that of swimming.
T ne hands and feet of accused were tied together crosswise.
She was V.Tapped in a sheet and thrown into a pond. If
she sank as frequently happened, she was deemed inno-
cent. but at the cost of her life, if she floated she was pro-
nounced guilty and forthwith executed. Another test
was to repeat the Lord's Prayt:r without a single falter or
stumble, a thing accredited impossible of a witch. On
one occasion she was weighed against the Church Bible,
obtaining her freedom if she outweighed it. It is alleged
but without certainty. that on his impostures being found
out an angry crowd subjected him to his own test by swim-
ming, but whether he was drowned or executed authorities
fail to agree.
In his Witcll, Warlock and Magiciatl Mr. Adams says,
" I think there can be little doubt that many evil-disposed
persons availed themselves to the prevalent belief in witch-
craft as a cover for their depredations on the property of
their neighbours, diverting suspicion from themselves to
the poor witches, who through accidental circumstances
had acquired notoriety as the dev1l's accomplices. It
would also seem probable that not a few of the reputed
witches similarly turned to account their bad reputa-
tion.''
It was not till the close of the sevt>nteenth Century that
convictions began to be discouraged by the Courts. But
an old superstition dies hard, and in the early part of the
eighteenth Century witchcraft was generally believed in,
in England, even among the educated classes.
Probably the revolu~on of opinion was effected between
the Restoration and the Revolution. According to Dr.
Parr, the last e.'Cecution of witches in England took place
at Northampton where two were hung in 1705, and at the
same place five others sufft'Ted a like fate in 1712. Hutch-
ison commenting on this in his Historical Essay says. •· This
is the more shameful as 1 shall hereafter prove from the
literature of that time, a disbelief in the existence of witches
had become almost universal among educated men, though
the old superstition was still defended in the J~dgment
Seat, and in the pulpit." Wesley who had .more m.flue~ce
than all the Bishops put together says, " It IS true hkew1se
that the English in general, and, indeed, most of th~ men
of learning in Europe, have given up all accounts of w1tches
and apparitions as mere old wives' fables. I am sorry
for it. T he giving up of witchcraft, is in effect g~ving up
the Bible. But I cannot !:ive up to all the Deists 1n Gr~t
Britain the existence of wttchcraft, till I give up the cred1t
of all history sacred and profane." .
Every year however, diminished the old belief, ~n.d m
1736. a generation before Wesley stated the above opu:'_lons,
the laws against witchcraft were repeated, but a_s. lllu_s-
trative of the long lived prevalence of t~e supersf;ition m
1759 Susannah Hannaker of Wengrove, 1n ''11'1ltsh1re, was
put to the ·ordeal of weighing, but she fortunatel:y: out-
weighed the Bible. Cases of ducking supposed -..ontches
occurred in 176o at Leicester, in 1785 at Northampton,
and in 1829 at :Monmouth, while as recently as 1863 .a
Frenchman died as the result of an illness caused by his
having been duckea as a 'Vizard, at Castle Hedingham
in Essex, and on September 17th, 1875, an old woman
England 146
named Ann Turner a reputed witch, was killed by a feeble-
minded man at Long Compton in Warwickshire.

Magic. Magic in England in early times is of course
one v.ith witchcraft, and it is only when we discern the
stupendous figure of Roger Bacon (q.v.~ that we find any
thing like separation between the two. Of course, the
popular traditions concerning Bacon are merely legendary.
but they assist to crystallise for us the idea of an English
magician of medieval times. The Eli~bctban History
of Friar Bacon was probably the first which placed these
traditions on record. Here we have no concern with the
Bacon of science, for the Bacon of magic is a magician
who cheated the Devil, who made a brazen head that spoke,
and who engaged in all manner of black magic.
In England the popular belief in magic was strengthened
by the extraordinary ef!ects of natural processes then
known only to a small number of individuals who concealed
their knowledge with the most profound secrecy. In
England, as we approach the age of the Reformation, we
find that the study of magic and alchemy have b~ome
extremely common among Lhe Romish clergy. The rapid
rise to power of men like Wolsey and Cromwell led people
to think that they ha<l gained their high positions through
diabolical assistance. The number of Magicians in the
reign of Henry VIII. was exceedingly great, as is witnessed
by documents in the Record Office. At the height of
Wolsey's greatness. a magician who is described as " one
Wood, gent." was dragged before the Privy-council,charged
with some misdemeanour which was connected with the
intrigues of the day. In a paper addressed to the lords
of the council, Wood states that William Nevill had sent
for him to his house at Oxford, it being the first commu-
nication he bad ever had with that .. person." After he
had been at Wekc a short time, Xe,,j,Uc took him by the
arm and led him privately into the garden, and, to use
the quaint language of the original, ·• ther demawndyd
of me many questyons, amowng all other askyd (if it)
were not possible to have a rynge made that should brynge
man in favor with hys prynce, saying my lord cardinale
had suche a rynge that whatsomevere he askyd of the
kynges grace that be hadd yt, ' and master Cromwell, w·hen
he and I were servauntys in my lord cardynales hO!lSSe,
dyd hawnt to the company of one that was seync in your
faculte, and shortly after no man so grett with my lord
cardynale as master Cromwell was.'" Keville added,
that he had spoken " \vitb all those who haye any name
in this realm, •· who had assured him that in the same way
he might become " great with his prince," and he ended
by asking of the reputed mat,<ician what books he had
studied on the subject. The latter continued, " and I,
at the harte desire of hym showyd that I had rede many
hokes, and specyally the boke of Salamon, and ho\': his
rynges be made and what mellell, and what Yertues they
had after the canon of Salamon." H<l added, that he had
also studied the magical work oi Hermes. William
Neville then requested him to undertake the making of
a ring. wh.ich he says that he declined, and so went away
for that time. But Neville ~en t for him again, and entered
into further communication wit1' him on the old subject,
telling him that he had with him another conjurer, named
\:Vade, who could show him more than he should ; and,
among other things. had showed him that '· he should be
a great lord," This was an effective attempt to move
Wood's jealousy; and it appears that Neville now pre-
vailed upon him to make " moldes," probably images,
" to the entent that be showld wed mastres Elezcbeth
Gare," on whom he seemed to have set his love. Perhaps
England
she was a rich heiress. Wood then enters into excuses
for himself, declaring that, although at the desire of" some
of his friends." .he had "called to a stone for things stolen,"
he had not undertaken to find treasures, and he concluded
with the naive boast, " but to make the pbylosofer's stone,
I will chebard (i.e, jeopard) my lytic lo do hyt, yf hyt plesse
the kynges good grace to command me do byt." This
was the pride of science above the low practitioner's. He
even offered to remain in prison until he had performed
his boast, and only asked " twelve months upon silver,
and twelve and a half upon gold."
The search for treasures, which the conjurer Wood so
earnestly disclaims, was, howe,•er, one of the most usual
occupations of our magicians of this period. The frequent
discoveries of Roman or Saxon, or medieval deposits, in
the course ol accidental digging-then probably more
common than at present-was enough to whet the appetite
of the needy or the miserly, and the belief that the sepul-
chral barrow, or the long deserted ruin, or even the wild
and haunted glen. concealed treasures of gold and silver
of great all\ount has been carried down to our owu days
in a variety of local legends. Hidden treasures were under
the particular charge of some of the spirits who obeyed
the magician's call, and we still lrace his operations in
many a barrow that has been disturbed, and ruined floor
that has been broken up. That these searches were not
always successful will be evident from the following
narrative:-
In the reign of Henry VIII. a priest named William
StaJ?leton was placed under arrest as a conjurer, and o.s
hav1og been mixed up in some court intrigues, and at the
request of Cardinal vVolsey he wrote an account of his
adventures, still preserved in the Roll's House r~ords
~for it is certainly addressed to Wolsey, and not, as has
oeen supposed, lo Cromwell). Stapleton says that he
had been a monk of the mitred abbey of St. Benet in the
Holm, in Norfolk, where he was resident in the nineteenth
year of Henry VIII. i.e. in 1527 or 1528, at which time
he borrowed of one Dcrinys, of Ho!ton, who had procured
them of the vicar of Walton, a book called Thesaurus
Spirituum, and after that another, called SecretaSeCYetormn,
a little ring, a plate, a circle, and also a sword for the art of
digging, in studying the usc of which he spent six months.
Now it appears that Stapleton had small taste for early
rising. and after having been frequently punished for being
absent from matins and negligent of his duty in church
he obtained a licence ,,f six months from the abbot to go
into the world, and try and raise money to buy a dispensa-
tion from an order which seemed so little agreeable to his
taste. The first person he consulted with v:as his friend
Dennys, who r~ommended him to try his s.b."ill in finding
treasure, and introduced him to two " knowing men,"
who bad " placards " or licences from the king to search
for treasure trove, which were not unfrequently bought
from tile crown at this period. These men lent him other
books and instruments belonging to the " art of digging,''
and they went together to a place named Sidestrand in
Norfolk, to search anu mark out the ground where they
thought treasure should lie. It happened, however, that
the lady Tyrry, to whom the estate belonged, received
intelligence of tbeir movements, and after sending for
them and subjecting them to a close examination. ordered
them to leave her grounds.
After this rebuff, the treasure-seekers went to Norwich.
where they became acquainted with another conjurer
named Godfrey, who had a "shower " of spirit, " which
spirit," Stapleton says, '· I had after myself," and they
went together to Felmingham, and there Godfrey's boy
did " scry " unto the spirit, but after opening the ground
they found nothing there. There are Roman barro\Ys
England 147
at Felmingham, which, when examined recently, appeared
to have been opened at a former period insearch of treasure.
The disappointed conjurers returned to Norv;-ich, and
there met with a stranger, who brought them to a house
in which it was supposed that treasure lay concealed, and
Stapleton again applied himself to his incantations, and
called the spirit of the treasure to appear, but he turned
a deaf ear to their charms. ' ' for I suppose of a truth," is
the pithy observation of the operator, " that there was
r.one."
Disappointed and d:sgusted, Stapleton now gave up
the pursuit. In Norfolk, however, he soon met with some
of his old treasure-seeking acquaintances, who uq~ed him
to go to work apin, which he refused to do unless hts books
were better. They told him of a man of the name of Leech,
who had a book, to which the parson of Lesingham had
bound a spirit called ·• Andrea Malchus ;"and to this man
he went. Leech let him have all his instruments, and
told him further that the parson of Lesingham and Sir
John of Leiston {another ecclesiastic) with others, had
called up of late by the means of the book in question
three spirits, Andrea Malchus (before mentioned). Oberion
and Inchubus. " When these spirits," he said, •· were
all raised, Oberion would in nowise speak. And then the
parson of Lesingham did demand of Andrea :ii'Ialchus, and
so did Sir John of Ldston also, why Oberion would not
speak to them. And Andrea :tvlalchus made answer, " For
because he v.'1ls bound unto the lord cardinal." And that
also they did entreat the said parson of Lcsingham, and
the said Sir John of Leiston, that they migl1t depart as
at that time; and whensoever it might please t11em to
call them up again, they would gladly do them any service
they could."
When Stapleton had made this important acquisition,
he repaired again to Non\-ich, where he had not long been,
when he was found by a messenger from the personage
whom he calls the lord Leonard Marquees, who lived at
" Calkett Hall," and who wanted a person expert in the
art of di~ging. He met lord Leonard at Walsingham,
who promtsed b.im that if he would take pains in exercising
the said art he would sue out a dispensation for him to be
a secular priest, and to make him his chaplain. The lord
Leonard proceeded rather shrewdly to make trial of the
searcher's talents ; for he directed one of his servants to
hide a sum of money in the garden, and Stapleton ·• hewed"
for it, and one, Jackson "scryed," but he was unable to
find the money. Yet, without being d:runted at this slip
Stapleton went directly with two other ~ricsts, Sir John
Shcpe and Sir Robert Porter, to a place bestde Creke Abbey.
where treasure was supposed to be, and Sir John Shepe
called the spirit of the treasure, and I shewed to him, but
all came to no purpose."
Stapleton now went to hide his disappointment in Lon-
don, and remained there some weeks, till the lord Leonard,
who had sued out his dispensation as he promised, sent
for him to ·pass the winter with him in LeicestershiTc, and
towards spr~ng he returned to Norfolk. And there he
wa.s inform~d that there was '· much money" hidden in
the neighbourhood of Calkett Hall, and especially in the
Bell Hill (probably an ancient tumulus or barrow), and
after some delay, he obtained his instruments, and went
to work with the parish priest of Gorleston, but ·• of truth
we could bring nothing to etfect." On this he again re-
paired to London, carrying his instruments with him, and
on his arrival he was thrown into prison at the suit of the
lord Leonard, who accused him of leaving his service with-
out permission, and all his instruments were seized. These
he never recovered, but be was soon liberated from prison,
and obtained temporary employment in the church.
But his conjuring propensities seem still to have lingered
England
about him, and we find this ex-monk and hermit, and now
secular priest, soon afterwards engaged in an intrigue
which led him eventually into a much more serious danger.
It appears by Stapleton's stat<'ments, that one Wright,
a servant of the Duke of Norfolk, came to him, and "at
a certain seasonshewed me that the duke's grac~. his master
was soore vexed with a spyrytt by the enchantment of
your grace" {he is addre.c;stng Wolsey). Stapleton says,
that he refused to interfere, but that Wright went to the
duke and told him that he, Stapleton, knew of his being
enchanted by Cardinal Wolsey, and that he could help
him ; upon which the duke sent for Stapleton, and had
an interview ";th him. lt bad pre,·iously been arranged
by Wright and Stapleton (who says that be had been urged
into the plot by the persuasion of Wright, and by the hope
of gain and prospect of obtaining the duke's favour) that
he should say he knew that the duke was persecuted by
a spirit, and that he had " forged" an image of wax in
his similitude, which he had enchanted, in order to relieve
him. The Duke of Norfolk appears at first to have placed
implicit belief in all that Stapleton told him; he inquired
of him if he had certain knowledge that the Lord Cardinal
had 3: spirit at his command, to which he replied in .the
negative. He then questioned him as to his having heard
anyone assert that the cardinal had a spirit ; on whi.;;h
Stapleton told him of the raising of Obcrion by the parson
of Lesingham and Sir John. of Leiston, and how Oberion
refused to speak, because he wz.s tlu~ lord cardinal's spirit.
The duke, howeYcr. soon after this, became either sus-
picious or fearful. and he e\·entually sent Stapleton to
the cardinal himself, who appears to have committed him
to ~rison, and at whose order he drew up the account here
abndged.
The foregoing is the history of a man who, after having
been a victim to his implicit belief in the efficiency of mag-
ical operations was himseH driven at last to have recourse
to intentional deception. The number of such treasure-
hunters appears to have been far greater among his con-
temporaries, of almost all the clas.c;cs of society, than ..._,.e
should at first glance be led to suppose. A few years before
the date of these e\·ents, in the 12th year of Henry VIII.,
or A.D. rszr, the king had gTanted to Robert, Lord Curzon,
the monopoly of treasure-seeking in the counties of Norfclk
and Suffolk, and Lord Curzor. immediately delegated to
a man, named William Smith, of Clopton, and a servant
or retainer f)f his O\vn, named Amylyon, not only the right
of search thus given to him, but the power to arrest and
proceed against any other person they found 'iecl..oing
treasures within the two counties. It appears that Smith
and Amylyon had in some cases used this delegated au-
thority for purposes of extortion ; and in the summer
of the same year, Smith was brou~ht up before the court
of the city of Norwich, at the sutt o! William Goodred,
of Great l\1elton, the minutes of the proceedings against
him still remaining on the records. \Ve here again find
priests concerned in these singular operations.
It appears that the treasure-diggers, who had received
their" placard " of Lord Curzon in March, went to Norwich
about Easter, and paid a visit to the schoolmaster, named
George Dowsing, dwelling in the parish of St. Faith, who,
they had beard, was ·• seen in astronymyc." They shewed
him their license for treasure-seeking, which authorised
him to press into their service any persons they might
find who had skill in the science; so that it would appeat
that they were not capable of raising spirits themselves
without the a-;sistance of " scholars." The schoolmaster
entered willingly into their project, and they went, about
two or three o'clock in the morning. with one or two othet
persons who were admitted into their confidence, and dug
in ground beside " Butter Hilles." within the walls of the
England 148 Enoch, Book of
city, but "found nothin~ there." These "billes," also,
were probably tumull. They next proceeded to a place
called "Seynt \Villiam in the Wood by Norwich," where
they excavated hvo days (or rather two nights), but with
no better success.
They now held a meeting at the house of one Saunders,
in the market of Norwich, and called to their assistance
two eeclcsia.stics, one named Sir William, the other Sir
Robert Cromer, the !on~er being the parish priest of St.
Gregory's. At. tilis mcctin;, George Do\~'Sing r~ised "a
spirit or two," 10 a glass ; but one of the pnests, Str Robert
Cromer, "began and raised a spirit first." This spirit,
according to the depositions, was seen by two f?r three
persons. Amylyon deposeu that " be was at Saunders's
where Sir Robert Cromer held up a stone, but he could
not perceive anything in it; but that George Dowsing
caused to rise in a glass a littla thing of the length of an
inch or thereabout, but whether it was a spirit or a shadow
he cannot tell, but the said George said it was a spirit."
However, spirit or no spirit, they seem to have had as
little success as ever in disc'overing the treasure.
Unable after so many attempts, to find the treasure
themselves, they seem now to have resolved on laying a
general contribution on everybody who followed the same
equivocal calling. They went first and accused a person
of the name of Wikman, of Morley Swanton, in the county
of Norfolk, of " digging of hilles,'' and, by threatening
to take him before Lord Curzon, they obtained from him
ten shillings. Under the same pretext, they took from
a lime-burner of Norwich, named White, a " christ<il-
stone," and twelvepence in n1oney in order thg.t he" should
not beput to further troublt>." They took both books (prob-
ably conjuring books) and money from John Wellys, of
Huoworth, near Holt Market, whom, similarly, they ac-
cused of "digging of hilles." And of another person,
labouring under the same charge, they took " a cbristal
stone and certain moner."
With the era of Dr. Dee (q.v.) Edward Kelly, (q.v.)
their school, a much more definite system ol magico-
astrology \Vas evolved on English soil. Although Dee was
credulous and Kelly was a rogue of the first water, there
is little doubt that the former possessed psychic gifts of
no mean character. His most celebrated fellowers were
William Lilly (q.v) and Elias Ashmole (q.v) not to speak
of Simon Forman (q.v.) and Evans (q.v.). Lilly gathered
about him quite a band of magicians, Ramsey, Scott,
Hodges, and others, not to speak .oi his ·• slayers" Sarah
Skclhonn and Ellen Evans. But these may be said to
be the last of the practical magicians of Et~gland. Their
methods were those of divination by crystal-gazing and
evocation of spirits, combined with p:actical astrol-
ogy.
Spiritual-ism. For the beginnings of spiritualism in
E·11gland we must go back to the middle of the seventeenth
century when Maxwell and Robert ;Fludd (q.v.) ftourished
and wrote concerning the secrets of mysticism and mag-
netism. Fludd was a Paracelsian pure and simple and
regarded man as the microcosm of the universe in minh-
ture. He was an ardent defender of the Rosicrucians,
concerning whom he wrote hvo spirited works, as well
a~ his great Tt'a&latus Apologeticus and many other alchemi-
cal and philoso?hical treatises. The part of the Tractalus
which deals with natural magic is one of the most authori-
tative ever penned on the subject, and divides the subject
most minutely into its several parts. Thomas Vaughan
(q.v.) is likewise ,a figure of intense interest about this
period. He was a supreme adept of spiritual alchemy
and his many works written under the Pseudonym of
Eugenius Philalethcs show him to have possessed an ex-
alted mind. It is to men of this type, magi, perhaps, but
none the less spiritualists, that the whole superstructure
of English spiritualism is ir.debted.

Enoch : Seventh m:1ster of the world after Adam, a.nd author
of the K!lbala and Book of the Tarot. He is identical with
the Thoth of the Egyptians, the Cadmus of the Phrenicians,
and the Palamedcs of the Greeks. According to tradition
be did not die, but was carried up to heaven, whence he
will return at the end of time.
Enoch, Book or : An Apochryphal book of the Old Testa-
ment, written in Hebrew about a centurv before Christ.
The original version was lost about the e~id of the fourth
century, and only fragments remained, but Bruce the trav-
eller brought ba;:k a copy from Abyssinia, in 1773
in Ethiopia, probably made from the version known to
the early Greek fathers. In this work the spiritual world
is minutely described, as is the region of Sheol (q.v.) the
phce of the wicked. The book also deals with the history
of the fallen angels, their relations with the human species
and the foundations of magic. The book says: " that
there were angels who consented to fall from heaven, that
they might have intercourse with the daughters of earth.
For in those days the sons of men having multiplied, there
were born to them daughters of great beauty. And when
the an~els, or sons of heaven, beheld them, they were
filled wtth desire; wherefore they said to one another: Come
let us choose wives from among the race of mao, and let us
beget children'. Their leader Samyasa, answered there-
upon and said : ' Perchance you will be wanting in the
courage needed to fulfil this resolution, and then I alone
shall be answerable for your fall.' But they swore that
they woul<l in no wise repent and that they would achieve
their whole design. ~ow there were two hundred who de-
scended on Mount Armon, and it was from this time that
the mountain received its designation, which signifies
Mou:tt of the Oath. Hereinafter follow the names of
those an~clic leaders who descended with this object: Sam-
ya'3a, chief among all, Urakabarameel, Azibeel, Tamiel,
Ramuel, D:lnel, Azkeel, Sarakuyal, Asael, Armers, Batraal,
An3.ne, Z9.vebe, Samevccl, Ertraei. Turel, Jomiael, Arizial.
They took wives with whom they had intercourse, to
whom also they taught Magic, the art of enchantment
and the diverse properties of roots and trees. Amazarac
gave instruction in all secreh of sorcerers; Barkaial was
the master of those who study the stars ; Alcibeel mani-
fested sign~; and Azaradel taught tbe motions of the
moon." In th:s account we sec a description of the pro-
fanation of mysteries. The fallen angels exposed their
occultand he.wen-born wisdom to earthly womert, whereby
it was profaned, and brute force taking advantage of the
profanation of divine law, reigned supreme. Only a deluge
could wipe out the stain of the enormity, and pave the
way for a restitution of the balance between the human
and the divine, which had been disturbed by these unlawful
revelations. A translation of the Book of Enoch was pub-
lished by Archb~hop Lawrence in 182I, the Etbeopie text
in 1838, and there is a good edition by Dillman (1851).

Epworth 149
Epworth, Poltergeist, The: In December, 1716, a disturbance
of a poltergestic character broke out in the Parsonage of
Epworth, the home of John Wesley. The evidence con-
sists in contctnporary letters written to Samuel Wesley
by his mother and two of his sisters ; letters written nine
years after the events to John Wesley by his mother and
four of his sisters, and a copy of an account by Samuel
\Vesley the elder. The disturbances, consisting of rappings,
loud and varied noises, were heard by every member of
the household. l\Irs, Wesley says in a letter, "Just as
we (Mr. and Mrs. Wesley) came to the bottom of the broad
stairs, having hold of each other, on mr side there seemed
as ii somebody had emptied a bag of money at my feet,
and on his as if all the bottles under the st<1.irs (which were
many) had been dashed in a thousand pieces." The dis-
turbances lasted for about two months, though occasional
manifestations were heard after that period. Hetty, one
of the five daughters of the Wesley household, is the only
one who has not left a record of her experiences, although
it would seem that the poltergeist was most active in her
neighbqurhood.
Equilibrium: Magical harmony depends upon equilibrium.
In occult operations if the will of the operator be always
at the same tension ar.d directed along the same line,
morji.l impotence will ensue. (See Levi- Ceremonial

Erie of tho Windy Hat : According Hector of Bo&;e,
the king of Sweden, Eric or Henry, surnamed the Windy
Rat, could change the wind merely by turning his hat or
cap on his head, to show the demon with whom he was
in league which war he wished the wind to blow. The
demon obeyed the s1gnal so promptly that the king's hat
might have served the people for a weather-cock.
Eromanty : One of six kinds of divination practised among
the Persians by means o£ air. They enveloped their heads

garded as a happy prognostication.
Esdaile : (See Hypnotism.)
Eskimos : The religion o£ the Eskimos is still to a great extent
in the magical stage. Theil ~hatn;>.ns or medicine-men,
whom they call Angekok partake more of the character
of magicians than th;>.t of priests and they invariably con-
sult them before starting on a hunting expedition, or when
prostrated by illness. The nature of the ceremonies em-
ployed on those occasions may be inferred from the account
of Captain Lyon, who on one occasion employed an angekok
named Toolemak, to summon a Tomga or familiar spirit
in the cabin of a ship.
All light having been carefully excluded from the scene
of operations, the sorcerer began by vehemently chanting
to his wife, who, in her turn, responded with the A nma-aya,
the favourite song of the Eskimo. This lasted throughout
the ceremony. Afterwards•. Toolemak began to turn him-
self round very rapidly, vociferating for Tomga, in a loud
powerful voice and with great impi!.tience, at the same
time blowing and snortinj; like a walrus. HW; noise,
agitation, ar.d impatience mcreased every moment, and
at length he seated himself on the deck, varying his tones,
and making a rustling with his clothes.
Suddenly the voice seemed smothered, and was so man-
aged as to give the idea that it was retreating beneath the
deck, each moment becoming more distant, and ultimately
sounding as if it were many feet below the cabin, when it
ceased entirely. In answer to Captain Lyon's queries,
t he sorcerer's wife seriously declared that he had dived
and would send up Tomga.
And, in about half a minute, a distant blo~~oing was heard
& klmos
approaching very slowly, and a voice differing from that
which had first been a.udiblc was mixed with the blo·wing,
until eventually both sounds became distinct, and the
old beldame said that Tomga had come to answer the
stranger's questions. Captain Lyon thereupon put several
queries to the sagacious spirit, receiving what was under-
stood to be an affirmative or a favourable answer by two
loud slaps on the deck.
A very hollow yet powerful voice, certainly differing
greatly from that of Toolemak, then chanted for some
titn<;l, and a singular me<lley of hisses, ~roans, and shouts,
and gobbliogs like a turkey's followed 1n swift succession.
The old v:o~n sang with increased energy, and as Captain
Lyon conjectured that the exbiuition was intended lo
astonish '· the Kabloona," he said repeatedly that he was
greatly terrified. A5 l:e expected, this admission added
fuel to the flame, until the form immortal, exhausted by
its own might, asked leave to retire. The voice gradually
died away out of heariu~. as at first, and a very indistinct
hissing succeeded. In 1ts advance it sounded like the
tone produced by the wind upon the bass cord of an lEolian
harp ; this was soon changed to a rapid hiss, like thal of
a rocket, and Toolcmak with a yell, announced the spirit's
return.
At the first distant sibilation Captain Lyon held his
breath, and twice exhausted h!Jrulclf; but the Eskimo
conjurer did not-once respire, and even his returning and
powerful yell was ulterell without p1·cvious pause or in-
spiration of air.
When light was admitlcd, the wizard, as might be ex-
pected, was in a state of profuse perspiration, and greatly
exhausted by his exertions. which bad continued for at
least half an hour. Captain Lyon then observed a couple
of bunches, each consisting of two s.trips of white deerskin
and a long piece of sinew, a~ched to the back of his coat.
These he had not seen before, ;>.nd he was gravely told that
they had been sewn on by Tomga while he was below.
The angekoks profess to visit the dwelling-place of the
spirits they invoke and give circumstantial descriptions
of these habitat:ons. They have a firm belief in their
own powers.
Dr. Kane considers it a fact of psychological interest,
as it shows that civilised or savage wonder-workers form
a single family, that the angckoks have a firm belief in
their own powers. " I have known," he says, " several
of them personally, and can speak with confidence on this
polnt. I could not detect them in any resort to jugglery
or natural magic ; their deceptions are simply vocal, a
change of voice, and perhaps a limited profession of ven-
triloquism, made more imposing by the darkness." They
have, however, like the members of the learned professions
everywhere else, a certain language or jargon of their own,
in which they communicate with each other.
" While the angekoks are the dispensers of good, the iss-
iJ•tok, or evil men, arc the workers of injurious spells, en-
chantments, and metamorphoses. Like the witches of
both Englands, the Old Md the New, these malignant
creatures are rarely submitted to trial until they have
suffered punishment-the old ·• Jeddart justice "-castigat
audifqtte. Two of them, in 1818, suffered the penalty of
their crime on the same day, one at Kannono.k, the other
at Upernavik. The latter w;o.s laudably killed in accor-
dance with the "old custom" .... custom being every-
where the apology for any act revolting to moral sense.
He was first harpooned, then disembowelled ; a flap let
down from his forehead to co,·er his eyes and prevent his
seeing again-he had, it appears, the repute of an evil eye;
-and then small fOrtions of his heart were eaten, to
ensw e that he should not come back to earth un-
changed."
Esoteric Languages 150 Etheric Double
Esoteric Languages : Artificial languages invented by certain
castes for the better preservation of secrets, or for the
purpose of impressing the vu:gar with the mysteries and
superior nature of those who employed the tongues in
question. "They conversed with one another in eager
undertones in a language I did not understand." This
is one of the stock phrases of the m}"tery novel of the
nineteenth century, and has probably given rise to a great
deal of misconception as to the true character and multi-
pliticy of esotenc tongues. As a matter of fact, these
are particularly rare. lt is stated by several ancient au·
thors that the Egyptian priests possessed a secret language
of their own ; but what its nature was we are unable to
state, as no fragments of it are now extant,-probably
because it was not reduced to writing. At the same time
many Egyptian magical formul<e are in existence (See
Egypt) which teem with word~ and expressions of secret
meaning; but examination of these snows that they are
merely foreign, usually Syrian, words slightly changed.
We know, for example, that the secret dialects of the
medicine-men among the North-American Indians are
chiefly composed either of archaic expressions or the
idioms of other tribes. But there are examples of the de-
liberate manufacture of a secret tongue, such as the Shelta
Thari (q.v) or language of the ancient caste of bronze-
workers, still spoken by the tinkler classes of Great Britain,
and the secret language of the .Vdembo caste (q.v.) of the
Lower Congo. It is probable that the Jewish priesthood
cast a veil of secrecy over the sacred names of the Deity,
and the higher ranks of their heavenly hierarchy, by sub·
stituting other names for them, such as " Adonai " for
"Jahveh." This of course arose from the Egyptian con-
ception that the name of the god must be concealed from
the vulgar, as to know it 'vas to possess magical power
over the deity. The spells and incantations of medi.eval
magic are full of oriental names and idioms, but much
jargon also found its way into these. It was considered
in the middle ages that the primitive language of the world
was lost to man, and it was thought that this might only
be recovered through magical ageccy. or the reversion to
a state of complete innocence. Others believed it to be
Hebrew; and it is on record that James IV. of Scotland
isolated two infants on the island of Inchkeith, in the Firth
of Forth along with a dumb woman who cared for them;
and that in course of time they " spak gude Ebrew." A
similar tradition.acquaints us with the circumstance that
a certain Egyptian king isolated two children in a like
manner, who en coming to the period of speech met the
first persons th~y beheld after their time of solitude with
the word beccos, the Greek for bread. But these instances,
it is unnecessary to say, are purely legendary. In many
savage tribes, secret jar~ons or dialects are in use among
the priesthood or the irutiated of secret societies; and in
several brotherhoods of modem origin, symbolic words
are constantly in use for the purpose of veiling veritable
meaning. The Rosicrucians {q.v.) are said to have con-
stituted and employed an arcane tongue.
Esplanadian : A medi.eval Spanish legend. It tells how Ama-
dis of Gaul and his wife Oriana of the Firm Island had the
wicked enchanter Archelous in their keeping, but set him
free in answer to his wife's entreaties. Certain calamities
happen which are attributed to Archelous, and Amadis'
son Esplandian is carried off by the enchantress Urganda.
The legend goes on to relate Esplandian's adventures, how
he is given a magic sword, and kills a dragon. With this
sword he succeeds in killing Archelous himself, and his
nephew, and he then sets free a kinsman. His next oppo-
nent is J\latrocd, son of Arcobone, whom he also van~tuishes ;
and finally the stronghold of Arcbelous is utterly destroyed,
and the land freed from the pagan influence of Matroed.

Essenes, The : A mystical Jewish sect, the tenets of which
are only partly known. They Jirst appeared in history
about 150 years B.C. They were very exclusive and pos-
sessed an organisation peculiar to themselves. They ex-
ercised strict asceticism, and sreat benevolence. They
had Jixed rules for initiation, and a succession of strictly
separate grades. Their system of thought deviated greatly
from the normal development of Judaism, and was more
in sympathy with Greek philosophy and oriental ideas.
The tendency of the society was practical, and they re-
g~rded speculation on the ~:niverse as too lofty for the
human intellect. So far as can be judged there was
nothing occult in their beliefs.
Etain : The second wife of Midir the Proud, of Irish fame.
Fuamnach, l't1idir's first wife, became jealous of her beauty
and turned her into a butterfly, and she was blown out of
the palace by a magic storm. For seven years she was
tossed hither and thither through Ireland. but then was
blown into the fairy palace of Angus on the Boyne. He
could not release her from the spell, but during the day sh<'
fed on honey-Laden flowers, and by night in her natural
form gave Angus her love. Fuamnach discovered her
hiding-place, and sent a tlreadful tempest which blew Etain
into the drinking-cup of Etar, wife of an Ulster chief. Etar
swallowed her, but she was born her daughter, and as such
married Eochy, High King of Ireland.
Etbilr sometimes spoken of as koilo'fl is in theosophic as in
scientific teaching, all pervading. filling all space and inter-
penetrating all matter. Despite this, it is of very great
density. 10,000 times more dense than water and with a
pressure of 7so tons per squarc inch. It is capable of being
known only by clairvoyants of the most highly developed
powers. Th:s ether is filled with an infinitude of small
bubbles pretty much like the air-bubbles in treacle or some
such viscid substance, and these were formed at some vastly
remote period by the infusion of the breath of the Logos
into the elfler, or, as Madame Blav~tsky phrased it, they
are the holes which Fohat. the Logos. dug in space. Of
these bubbles-not of the ethe1'-matter is built up in its
degree of density varying with the n'!lmber of bubbles com-
bined together to form each degree. (See Solar System,
Theosophy.)
Etberle Double is, in Theosophy, the invisible part of the
ordinary, visible, physical body which it interpenetrates
and beyond which it extends for a little, forming with other
finer bodies the "aura" (q.v.) The term etheric is used
because it is composed of that tenuous matter by the vi-
brations of which the sensation of light is conveyed to the
eye. This matter, it must however be noted IS not the
omnipresent ether of space, but is composed of physical
matter known as etheric, super-ctheric, sub-atomic, and
atomic. The term double is used because it is an exact
replica of the denser physical body. The sense organs of
the elheric double are the chahsams (q.v.) and it is through
these chahsams (q.v.) that the physical body is supplifd
with the vitality necessary for its existence and its well-
being during life. The etheric double thus plays the part
ofa conductor, and it also plays the part of a bridge between
the physical and astral bodies, for without it man could
have no communication with the astral world and hence
neither thoughts nor feelings. An<esthetics for instance
drive out the greater part of the double, and the subject
is then impervious to pain. During sleep it does not leave
the physical body, and, indeed, in dreams the etheric part
of the brain is extremely active, especially when, as is often
the case, the dreams are caused by attendant physical
Etheric Vision 151 Exoroism
circumstances, such as noise. Shortly after death, the
elheYic double finally quits the physical body though it does
not move far away from that body, but is composed of the
four subdivisions of physical matter above alluded to.
With the decay of the latter, the double also decays and
thus to a clairvoyant, a burying ground presents a most
unpleasant si~ht. (See also Vitality, Etberic Vision, The-
osophy, Shell.)
Etherlc Vision is in Theosophy, the power of sight peculiar
to the Etheric Double (q.v.). It is of considerably greater
power than obysical vision, and by its aid many of the
phenomena of the physical world may be examined as
may also many creatures of a non-human nature which
are ordinarily 'just outside the range of physical vision.
It responds readily to stimuli of various kinds and be-
comes active under their influence.
Ethllnn : Daughter of Bator, King of the Fomorians of Irish
magical legend. She was Bator's only child, and as he
had been informed by a druid that he would be killed by
his grandson, he had Ethlinn imprisoned m a tower and
guarded by twelve women, who were forbidden to tell her
that such beings as men existed. Bator stole a ma.gic cow
from I<ian, who in revenge obtained acces.~ to Ethlin"
n dis-
guised as a woman. They had three children whom Bator
-ordered to be drowned, but one of them fell from the nap-
kin in which they were bein{;_ taken to their doom. and was
carried off by the Druidess uirog to its father J<ian. Thi!>
child became Lugh, the ~rcat sun-god, who eventually
fulfilled the prophecy ant! killed his grandfather, Balor.
Ettellla : An eighteenth century student of the Tarot. By
profession he was a barber, his true name being:"A!Lette;
but on enteringupon his occult labours he read it backw<:.rds,
after the Hebrew fashion-Eteilla. lie had but little
education, and was ill acquainted with the philosophy of
the initiates. Nevertheless he possessed a profound in-
tuition, and, if we believe Eliphas Levi, came very near
to unveiling the secrets of the Tarot. Of his writings Levi
says that they arc " obscure, wearisome, and in style bar·
barous." He claimed to have revised the Book of T/JQt,
but in reality he spoilt it, regarding as blunders certain
<ards whose meaning be had failed to grasp. It is com-
monly admitted tllat he failed in' his attempt to elucidate
the Tarot, and ended by transposing the keys, thus destroy-
ing the correspondence between the numbers and the signs.
It has also been said of him that he had degrcded the science
of the Tarot into the cartomancy, or fortune-telling by
cards, of the vulgar.
E vergreens : The custom of decorating houses at Christmas-
tide with eveygrew plants-holly, ivy, box, laurel, mistletoe
- is sometime> said to have originated when Christianity
wJ.S introduced into tltis country, to typify the first British
church, built of evcrgnm boughs. lllore prohably it elC-
tends b:~.ck into antiquity. In Druiclic times people dec-
orated their hou~es with evergree11 plantsso that the sylvan
spirits· might repair thither to shelter from the severity
of winter, till their leafy bowl!rS should be renewed.
Everitt, Mrs. : An English medium who gave private seances
so early as rSss. To these sessions were admitted her
private friends, and enquirers introduced by them. \Vhen
a prayer had been said and the lights turned out the spirits
manifested themselves by raps, table-tiltings, lights and
spirit voices. Mr. Morell Theobald, a prominent spiritu-
alist, was neighbour and friend to :.ir. and 1\hs. EveYitt,
and was first attracted to the subject through their in-
strumentality.
Evocations : (See Necromancy).
.Evolution of Life, acording to theosophists·, began when
the Logos, in his second aspect, sent forth the second ijfe
wave. Th!s life wave descends from above through the
variou-; worlds causing an increasing .heterogeneity and
thereafter ascends, causing a return to its original homo-
geneity. Our present state of knowledge of life in these
worlds extends no farther than the mental world. In the
higher division of that world it has ensouled the relatively
fine matter appropriate thereto- if that matter is atomic
it is known as •· monadic essence" if non-atomic, as " ele-
mental essence," and this is known as the first elemental
kingdom. What we may call the inhabitants of.this king·
dom are the higher order of angels. The life wave having
functioned sufficiently long in the higher mental world,
now presses down to the lower level of that world, where
it appears as the second elemental kingdom, the inhab-
itants of which are some of the lower orders of angels, the
Form Devas. Again pressing down, the life wave manifests
itself in the astral world, forming the third elemental king-
dom, the inhabitants of which are the lowest orders of
angels, the Passion Deva<;. It now enters the physical
world and, in the fourth elemental kingdom, ensouls the
etheric part of minerals with the elementary type of life
which these possess. The middle of this kingdom repre·
sents the farthest descent of the life wave, and thereafter
its course is reversed and it commences to ascend. The
next kingdom into which it passes is the fifth elemental
kingdom. the vegetable world, whence it passes to the
sixth elemental kingdom, the animal world, and lastly
to the seventh elemental kingdom, man. During its stay
in each kingdom. the life wave progresses gradually from
elementary to highly specialised types and when it bas
attained these latter, it passes to the next kingdom. This,
of course, of nece~sity means that successive currents of
this great second life wave have come forth from the
Logos, since, if it were otherwise, there would be only one
kingdom in existence at a time. In each kingdom, also,
the so:.~ls of the bodies which inhabit it differ from those
or the other kmgdoms. Thus, in the seventh kingdom,
that of m'ln, each individual has a soul. In the animal
kingdom on the contrary, one soul is distributed among diff-
erent bodies, the number of which varies with the state of
evolution. To one soul may be allotted countless bodies
of a low type of development, but, as the development
incr~.ses, the soul comes to have fewer bodies allotted to
it until in the kingdom of man there is but one.
Exorcism : To exorcise, according to the received definitions,
says Smedley, !s to bind upon oath, to charge ujA)n oath,
and thus, by the use of certain words, and performance
of certain ceremonies, to subject the devil and other evil
spirit<; to command and exact obedience. :Minshew calls
an "exorcist" a "conjuror;" and it is so used by
Shakespe:lre ; and exoYcism, " conjuration." It is in the
general sense of casting out evil spirits, however, that the
word is now understood.
The trade of exorcism has probably existed at all times
In Greece, Epicurus and JEschines, were sons of women
who lived by thi~ art, and each was bitterly reproached,
the one by the Stoics, theother by Demo<>thenes, for having
assisted his parent in her dishonourable practices.
We read in the Acts of the Apostles (XIX. 13) ofthefailure
and disgrace of ·• certain of the vagabond Jew<>, exorcists,"
who, like the Apostles, " took upon them to call over them
tllat bad evil spirits the Name of the Lord Jesus.'' "God,"
sr.ys Josephus," enabled Solomon to learn that skill which
expels demons, which is a science useful and sanative to
men. He composed such incantations also, by which
distempers are alleviated, and he left behind him the man-
ner of using exorcisms, by which they drive away demons,
so that they never return. And this method of cure is of
great force unto this day; for I have seen a certain man
of my own country, whose name wa'> Eleazar, releasing
people that were demoniacal, in the presence of Vespasian
and hi~ sons, and his captains, and the whole multitude
Etorelsm 152
of his soldiers. The manner of the cure was this. He
put a ring that had a root of one of those sorts mentioned
by Solomon to the nostrils of the demoniac, after which
he drew out the demon through his nostrils ; and -n-hen
the man fell down immediately, be adjured him to return
unto him no more, making still mention of Solomon, and
reciting the incantation which he- composed. And when
Eleazar would persuade and demonstrate to the spectators
that he had such a power, he set, a little way off, a cup
or basin full of water, and commanded the demon as he
went out of the man to overturn it, and thereby to let the
spectators know that he had left the man." Some pre-
tended fragments of these conjuring books of Solomon
are noticed in the Codex Pseudepigraphus of Fabricus;
and Josephus himself has described one of the antidemo-
niacal roots, in a measure reminiscent of the perils
attendant on gathering the "mandrake." Another frag-
ment of antiquity bearing on this subject is the exorcism
practised by Tobit, upon which it is by no means easy to
pronounce judgment. Grotius, in a note on that history,
states that the Hebrews attributed all diseases arising from
natural causes to the inftuence of demons; and this opinion
it is well known, has been pushed much farther than Grotius
intended, by Hugh Farmer and others of his school. These
facts are derived in great measure from Dekker's most
ingenious, though forgotten volumes I.e Monde Enchanli,
to which the reader may be referred for almost all that
can be written on the necessity of exorcism.
Bekker relates an instance of exorcism practised by the
modern Jews, to avert the evil influence of the demon Lilis,
whom the Rabbis esteem to be the wife of Satan. During
the hundred and thirty years, says Rabbi Elias, in his Thisbi
which elapsed before Adam was married to Eve, he was
visited by certain she devils, of whom the four principal
were Lilis, Naome, O~~re, and Machalas ; these, from
their commerce with him, produced a fruitful progeny of
spirits. Lilis still continues to visit the chambers of woruen
recently delivered, and endeavours to kill their babes, i!
boys on the eighth day, if girls, on the twcnty-fust, after
their birth. In order to chase her away, the attendants
describes circles on the walls of the chamber, with charcoal,
and v.ithin each they v.Tite, " Adam, Eve, Lilis, avaunt ! "
On the door also o! the chamber they write the names of
the three angels who preside over medicine, Senoi, San-
senoi, and Sanmangelof,-a secret which it appears was
taught them, somewhat unwittingly, by Lilis herself.
A particular ecclesiastical order of exorcists docs not
appear to have existed in the Christian church till the close
of the third century; and Mosheim attributes its intro-
duction to the prevalent fancies of the Gnostics. In the
Xth. Canon of the Council of Antioch, held A.D. 341 ex-
orcists are expressly mentioned in conjunction with
subdeacons and readers, and their llrdination is described
by the IVth. Council of Carthage, 7· It consisted, without
any imposition of hands, in the delivery, by the Bishop of
a book containing forms of Jxorcism, and directions that
they should exercise the office upon " Energumens,"
whether baptized or only catechumens. The fire of uor·
cism, as St. Augustine terms it, always preceded baptism.
Catechumens '"ere exorcised for twenty days previous to
the administration of this sacrament. It should be ex-
pressly remarked, however, that in the case of such cate-
chumens as were not at the same time energumens, these
exorcisms were not directed against any supposed demoni-
acal possession. They were, as Cyril describes them, no
more than prayers collected and composed out of the words
of Holy Writ, to beseech God to break the dominion and
power of Satan in new converts, and to deliver them from
his slavery by expelling the spirit of wickedness and
error.
Exorcism
Thus in the Greek Church. as Rycaut mentions, before
baptism, the priest blows three times upon the child to
dispossess the devil of his seat; and this may be nuder-
stood as symbolical of the power of sin over the unba~
tized, not as an assertion of their real or absolute
possession.
The exorcists form one of the minor orders of the Rom!sh
Church. At their ordination the bishop addresses them
as to their duties, and concludes with these words :-Take
now the power of laying hands upon the energumens, and
by the imposition of your bands, by the grace of the Holy
Spirit, and the words of exorcism, the unclean spirits are
driven from obsessed bodies. One of the completest man-
uals for a Romish exorcist which ever 't\'as compiled, is a.
volume of nearly 1300 pages, entitled, Thesaurus Exor-
cismorum et Conjurationum terribllium, potentissimorum,
efficacissimortlmque, c11m Practica probatissima, quibus,
SpiriltlS maligni, Damones, malecifiaque omnia de corpori·
bus humanis tanq11am F/agellis Fustigusqttt jugantur, ex-
pelluntur. Doctrinis rejerlissimus atque uberrimus ; ad
maximam Exorcistamm commodi-Tatem in lttcem editus
et recusus, Colonia, 16o8. It contains the following Tracts :
F. Valerii Polydori Patavi.ni, Ordinis :Minor, etc. " Practica
Exorcistarum," two parts; F. Hieronymi l\Iengi Vitel-
lianensis, " Flagellum Dremonum ;" Ejusdem " Fustis
Dremonium ;" F. Zachari<e Vicecomitis, " Complementum
Artis Exorcisti<e ; " Petri Antonii Stampre, " Fuga
Satan<e."
From the first of these treatises, it appears that the en-
ergumens were subjected to a very severe corporal as well
as sptritual discipline. They were first exercised in Prre·
xorcirationes " which consist of confessions, postulations,
protestations, concitations, and interrogations. The e.1:·
otcisms themselves are nine in number : 1. " ex Sanctis
nominibus Dei," which are thus enumerated, " Schem-
hamphoras, Eloha, Ab, Bar, Ruachaccocies Jehovah,
Tetragrammaton, Heheje, Ha~a hove vejbege, El Sabaoth,
Agla, Adonai, Cados, Sciada1, Alpha and Omega, Agios
and Yschiros, 0 Theos and Ath:10atos ; 2. ex omnium
Sanctorum ordine: 3· ex pr<ecipuis animadversione
digds Sanctorum Angelorum ; 4· ex actibus vit<e glor-
ios<e Virg. Maria! : 5· ex gestis, Domini Nostri Jesu Christi;
6. ex institutis venerabilium Sacramentorum ; 7· ex
prrecipuis S. Ecclcsi<e Dogmatibus ; 8. Apocacalypsis
(Afocalypsewsl Beati Joannis Apostoli." All these are
accompanied with appropriate psalms, lessons, litanies,
prayers, and adjurations. Then follow eight " Postexor·
cizationes." The three first are to be used according as
the demon is more or less obstinately bent on retaining
possession. If he is very sturdy, a picture of him is to be
drawn, " effigie borribili ac turpi," with his name inscribed
under it, and to be thrown into the 1lames, after having
been signed with the cross, sprinkled with holy water and
fumigated. The fourth and fifth are forms of thanksgiving
and benediction after liberation. The sixth refers to " In·
cubi" and "Succubi." The seventh is for a haunted
bouse, in which the service varies during every day of the
week. The eighth is to drive away demoniacal storms
and tempests--for which purpose are to be thrown into
a huge fire large quantities of Sabin::e, Hupericonis, Palmre
Christi, Artbcmesize, Verbenre, Aristolochi<e rotund<e,
Rut<e, Aster, Att:ici, Sulphuris et Assre fetid::e. The second
part of the treatise " Dispersio Dremonum " contains many
recipes for charms and: am_ulets against .Possession.. ~e­
sides these, there are dtrections for the dtet and medicme
of the possessed, as bread provided " contra Diaboli ne-
quitiam et maleficiorum turbinem." Mutton "pro obsess!
nutrimento atque )laleficu et Dremonis detrimento." 'Wine
" pro maleficiatis nutriendis et maleficiis Diabolicisque
quibuscunque infestatio:tibus destruendis." Holy water
Exorcism 153 Exorcism
!or the same purpose, whenever wine is forbidden. A
draught "ad omne malcficium indiffcrcnter solvcndum
et Diabolum conterendum." Four separate lavements and
a night draught for the delirious ; two emetics " pro ma-
tcrialibus instrumentis maleficialibus ernittendis." And
finally, there is a conserve " virtuosius corroborativa ven-
triculi a maleficialium instrumentorum materialium
vomitione fessi."
In the " Flagellum Dremonum " are contained numerous
cautions to the e;r.orcist himself, not to be deceived by
the arts of the demon, particularly w.hen be is empltlyed
with possessed women. If the devil refuses to tell his name,
the demoniac is to be fumigated. If 1t be necessary to
break off the exorcism before the evil spirits be wholly ex-
pelled, they arc to be adjured to quit the head, heart, and
stomach of the energumen, and to abscond themselves
in the lower parts of his body, "puta in ungues mortuos
pedum."·
In the " Fustis Dremonum " the exorcist is directed,
whenever the evil spirit persists in staying, to load him
with vituperative addresses. After this railing latinity,
redoubled precaution is necessary, and if the demons stiU
refuse to tell their names, the knowledge of which is always
great gain, the worst names that can be thought of are to
be attributed to them, and fumigations resorted to. The
seventh exorcism in this treatise is " mirabilis cfficacire pro
his qui in matrimonis a Dremonibus vel maleficis diabolica
arte impediuntur seu maleficiantur." Among other things,
they arc to be.largely anointed with holy oil ; and if all
adjurations fail, they arc to be strenuously exhorted to
patiettce. In the last form, dumbness is attacked, and a
very effectual r.emcdy against this infirmity is a draught
oi holy water with three drops of holy wax, swallowed on
an empty stomach.
Father Vicccomcs, in his Complemenium Artis E:f'or-
cistice, explains the several signs of possession or bev.<itch-
ment; also, in how many separate ways the evil spirit
notifies his departure, sometimes by putting out the light,
now and then by issuing like a flame, or a very cold blast,
through the mouth, nose, or ears. He then writes many
prescriptions for emetics, perfumes, and fumigations, cal-
culated to promote these results. The writer concludes
with a catalogue of the names of some of the devils of com-
monest occurrence, which is of very narrow dimensions :
Astaroth, Baal, Cozbi, Dagon, Aseroth, Baalimm, Chamo,
Beelphegor, Astarte. Bethage, Phogor, Moloch, Asmodreus,
Bele, Ncrgcl, :Mclchon, Asima, Bel, Kcxroth, Tartach,
Acharon, Belial, Neabaz, Merodach, Adonides, Beremot,
Jerobaal, Socothbenoth, Beelzebub, Leviathan, Lucifer,
Satan, Mahomet.
The Fuga Satance of Stampa is very brief, and does not
contain any matter which deserves to be added to the much
fuller instructions given by Mengs and Vicecomes. Several
of the forms used by Mengs arc translated and satirized,
in the coarse ridicule which characterized those times, in
a little tract entitled A WJ.ip for the Devil, or the Romatl
Conjuror, 1683. A century and a half before this, Erasmus
had directed his more polished and delicate wit to the ~me
object; and his pleasant dialogue E:rorcismus seu Spectrum
is an agreeable and assuredly an unexaggerated picture
of these practices.

cism should consult the Histoire admirable de la possession

The possessed in this case, M.agdelaine de Palha, was
exorcised during four months ; sbc was under the power of
five princes of the devils, Beelzebub, Leviathan, Baalberith,
Asmodeus and Astaroth, " avec plusieurs autres inferieurs."
Beelzebub abode in her forehead, Leviathan in the middle
of her head, Astaroth in the hinder part of it; " Ia partie
de Ia tete ou its estoient faisoit, contre nature, un perpetual
mouvemcnt ct battcment ; estans sortis Ia partie ne bouge-
oit point."
A second sister of the same convent, Loyse, was also
possessed by three devils of the highest degree, Verin,
Gresil, and Soneillon ; and of these, Verin, through the
proceedings of the exorcists, appears to have turned king's
evidence, as it were; for, in spite of the remonstrances and
rage of Beelzebub," qui commen~a a rugir eta jetterdes cris
comme fcroit un taurcau 6chauff6," he gave important
information and instruction to his enemies, and appeared
grievously to repent that he was a devil. The daily Acts
and Examinations, from the 27th of November to the
following 23rd of April, arc specially recorded by the
exorcist himself, and all the conversations of the devils are
noted down verbatim. The whole business ended in a
tragedy, and Louis Gaufridi, a priest of Marseilles, who was
accused of witchcraft on the occasion was burned alive
at Aix.
Michaelis is eminently distinguished in his line. We
find him three years afterwards engaged in exorcising three
nuns in the convent of St. Brigette, at Lisle. Whether
the two unhappy women, Marie de Sains and her accom-
plice, Simone Dourlet, who were supposed to have been the
causes of this possession, were put to death or not, does
not appear. The proceedings may be found in a Histoire
Veritable et memoYable de ce qui c'est passe SOliS l'Exorcisme
de trois filles possedees all pats tk Flandre, Paris 16"23; and
they arc in some respects an appendix to those against
Louis Gaufridi, whose imputed enormities arc again related
in a second volume of this work.
This transaction appears to have been the work o! super-
stition alone ; but one of far deeper dye, and of almost
unparalleled atrocity, occurred at l.oudun (q.v.) in 1634,
when Grandier (q.v.), cure and canon of that town, was
mercilessly brought to tbc stake partly by the jealousy
of some monks, partly to gratify the personal vengeance
of Richelieu, who bad been persuaded that this ecclcsiast
had lampooned him, an offence which he never forgave.
Some Ursline nuns were tortured to feign themselves pos-
sessed, and Grandier was the person accused of having
tenanted them with devils. Tranquille, one of the exor-
cists, published a Verilable relatio1l des j uste procEdures
observees a11 fait de Ia possession des Ursuli11es de Louduu,
el au procls de Grand1er, Paris 1634 ; and by a singular
fatality, this reverend personage himself died within four
years of the iniquitous execution of his victim, in a state
of reputed possession, probably distracted by the self-
accusations of remorse.
The la.~t acknowledgment of exorcism in the Anglican
Church, during the progress of the Reformation, occurs
in the :first Liturgy of Edward VI. in which is given the
following form at baptism; "Then let the priest, looking
upon the children, say, ' I command thee, unclean spirit,
in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost, that thou come out and depart from these infants,
whom our Lord Jesus Christ has vouchsafed to call to His
holy baptism. to be made members of His Body and of His
Holy congregation. Therefore, thou cursed spirit, re-
member thy senteuce, remember thy judgment, remember
the day to be at hand wherein thou shalt burn in fire ever-
lasting prepared for tbee and thy angels. And presume
not hereafter to exercise any tyranny towards these infants
whom Christ hath bought with His precious blood, and
by this His holy baptism calletb to be of His fiock.' " On.

of the Saone, into which he plun;;ed headlong, and was
never afterwards seen. Le Loyer says:-" With regard
to the demons whom they imprisoned rn rings and charms,
the magicians of the school of Salamanca and Toledo, and
their master Picatrix, together with those in Italy who
made traffic of this kind of ware, knew better than t9 say
whether or not they had appeared to those who had been
in possession or bought them. And truly I cannot speak
without horror of those who pretend to such vulgar famili-
arity with them, even to speaking of the nature of each
particular demon shut up in a ring; whether he be a Mer-
curial, jovial, Saturnine, Martial, or Aphrodisiac spirit;
in what form he is wont to appear when required; how
many times in the night he awakes his possessor; whether
benign or cruel in disposition ; whether he can be trans-
ferred to another ; and if, once possessed, he can alter the
natural temperament, so as to render men of Saturnine
complexion jovial, or the Jovials Saturnine, and so on.
There is no end of the stories which might be collected under
this head, to which if I gave faith, as some of the learned
Qf our time have done, it would be filling my paper to little
purpose. I will not speak therefore of the crystal ring
mentioned by Joalium of Cambray, in which a young child
could sec all that they demanded of him, and which eventu-
ally was broken by the possessor, as the occasion by which
the devil too much tormented him. Still less will l stay
my pen to tell of the sorcerer of Courtray, whose ring had
a demon enclosed in it, to whom it behoved him to speak
every five days. In fine, the briefest allusion must suffice
to what they relate of a gentleman of Poitou, who had
playfully taken from·the bosom of a young lady a certain
charm in which a devil was shut up. " Having thrown
it into the fire," the story goes, "he was incessa:ntly tor-
mented with visions of the devil till the latter granted him
another charm, similar to the one he had destroyed, for the
purpose of returning to the lady and renewing her interest
in him." Heywood writes, if not much more fully on the
subject than Le Loyer does, and evidently attaches a far
greater degree of credibility to the narratives which he
brings forward. ·• Grillandus is of opinion, that everie
Magition and Witch, after they have done their homage
to the dcvell, have a familiar spirit given to attend them,
whom they call ' Magistellus,' ' Magister,' ' Martinettus '
or ' Martinellus' " and these are sometimes visible to men
in the shape of a dog, a rat, an aethiope, etc. So it is re-
ported of one Magdalena Crucia, that she had one of these
paredrii to attend her like a blackemore. Glycas tells us,
that Simon Magus had a great black dog tyed in a chaine,
who, if any man came to speak with him whom he bad no
desire to see was ready to devoure him. Ills shadow like-
wise he caused still to go before him ; making the people
beleeve that it was the soule of a dead man who still at-
tended him.
" These kindes of familiar spirits are such as they include
or kecpe in rings hallowed, in viols, boxes, and caskets;
not that spirits, having no bodies, can be imprisoned there
against their wills, but that they seem to be confined of
their own free-will and voluntaric action.
" Johannes Leo writetb. that such are frequentin Africke,

latrices, by which the Magitions raise great summes of
money, by predicting by them of things future. For being
demanded of any difficulty, they bring an answer written
in a small scroll of paper, and deliver it to the magition in
their bills. :\fartinus Anthonius Delrius, of the Society
of J~us, a man of profound learning and judgment, writeth,
that ID Burdegell there was an advocate who in a viol kept
one of these Paradrii inclosed. Hee dying, his heires know-

affumeth, that he received them of Jarcha, the great prince
of the Gymnosophists, which he took of him as a rich pres-
ent, for by them he could be e.cquainted with any deep
secret whatsoever. Such a ring had johannes Jodocus
Rosa, a citizen of Cortaccnsia, who every fifth day had
conference with the spirit enclosed using it as a counsellor
and director in 11-ll his affairs and interprises whatsoever.
By it he was not onely acquainted with all newes as well
forrein as domesticke, but learned the cure and remedy
for all griefs and diseases; insomuch that he had the repu-
tation of a learned and excellent physition. At length,
being accused of sortilege or enchantment, at Arnham,
in Guelderland, he was proscribed, and in the year 1548
the chancellor caused his ring, in the public market. to be
layd upon an anvil, and with an iron hammer beaten to
pieces.
" Mcngius reportelh from the relation of a deare friend of
his (a man of approved fame and honestie) this historic.
In a certain town under the jurisdiction of the Venetians,
one of their pro:estigious artists (whom some call Python-
ickes), having one of these rings, in which he had two fa-
miliar spirits exorcised and bound, came to a predicant
or preaching friar, a man of sincere life and conversation;
and confessed unto him that hee was possessed of such an
enchanted ring, with such spirits charmed, with whom he
had conference at his pleasure. But since he considered
v.-ith himselfe, that it was a thing dangerous to his soule,
and abhominable both to God and man, he desired to be
cleanly acquit of it, and to that purpose he came to receive
of him some godly counsell. But by no persuasion would
the religious man be induced to have any speech at all with
these evil spirits (to which motion the other had before
earnestly solicited him), but jl.dmonished him to cause the
magicke ring to be broken, and that to be done with all
speed possible. At which words the familiars were heard
(as it were) to mourne and lament in the ring, and to desire
that no such violence might be offered unto them; but
rather than so, that it would please him to accept the ring,
and keepe it, promising to do him all service-and vassallage :
of which, if he pleased to accept, they would in a short time
make him to be the most famous and admired predicant
in all Italy. But he perceiving the devils cunning, under
this colour of courtesie, made absolute rcfusall of their offer ;
and withall conjured them to know the reason why they
would so willin9ly submit themselves to his patronage ?
After many evas1ve lies and deceptious answers, they plainly
confessed unto him, that they had of purpose persuaded
the magition to heare him preach; that by that sermon,
his conscience being pricked and galled, he might be weary
of the ring, and being refused of the one, be accepted of
the other; by which they hoped in short time so to have
puft him up with pride and heresie, to have percipitated
his soule into certaine and never ending destruction. At
which the churchman being ~ealously inraged, with a great
hammer broke the ring almost to dust, and in the name of
God sent them thence to their own habitation of darkness,
or whither it pleased the highest powers. to dispose them.
" Of this kinde doubtlesse was the rmg of Ggyes (of
whom Herodotus doth make mention), by vertue of which

he had power to walkc invisible; who, by the murder of
his sovereign Candaules, married his queene, and so became
King of Lydia. Such, likewise, had the Phoccnsian tyrant,
who, as Clemens Stromaeus speaketh, by a sound which
came of itselfc, was warned of all times, s;::asonable and
unseasonable, in which to manage his affairs; who. not-
withstanding, could not be forewarned of his pretended
death. but his familiar left him in the end, su11cring him to
be slain, by the conspirators. Such a ring, likewise, had
one Hieronimus. Chancellor of Mediolanum, which after-
wards proved to be his untimely :uine." (Hiuarchie of the
Blessed Angels. t1ii.; The Principats, p. 475, etc.)
Sometimes the familiar annexed himself voluntarily to a
master, without any exercise of magic skill or invocation
on his part, nor could such a spirit be disposed of without
exorcism, as we learn from the following story cited by
Delrio (vi., c. ii., s. 3., q. 3.) ;-" A certain man (pater
familias-head of a family). lived at Trapani, in Sicily, in
whose house it is said, in the year 1585. mysterious voices
bad been heard for a period of some months. This familiar
was a dremon, who, in various ways, endeavoured to annoy
man. He had cast huge stones. though as yet he had
broken no mortal head ; and he had even thrown the
domestic vessels about. but without fracturing any of them.
When a young man in the house played and sung, the
demon, hearing all. accompanied the sound of the lute
with lascivious songs, and this distinctly. He vaunted
himself to be a da::mon ; and when the master of the house,
together with his wife, went away on business to a certain
town, the da::rnon volunteered his company. When he
returned, however, soaked through with rain, the spirit
went forward in advance, crying aloud as he came, and
warning the servants to make up a good fire," etc. In
spite of these essential services. the paterfamilias called in
the aid of a priest and expelled the familiar, though not
without some difficulty.
A learned German physician has given an instance in
which the devil of his own accord enclosed himself in a ring
as a familiar, thereby proving how dangerous it is to trifle
with him.
Paracelsus was believed to carry about with him a
familiar in the hilt of his sword. Naude assures us, that
he never laid this weapon aside even when he went to bed,
that he often got up in the night and struck it violently
against the fioor, and that frequently when overnight he
was without a penny, he would show a purseful of gold in
the morning. (Apologi4 pottr les Grands Hommes soup-
~nnu lk Magie, xiv., p. z8x.) After this, we are not a
little disconcerted with the ignoble explanation which he
gives of this reputed demon, namely, that although the
alchemists maintain that it was no other than the philo-
sopher's stone. he (Naudc) thinks it more rational to
believe, if indeed there was anything at all in it, that it
was two or three doses of laudanum, which Paracelsus
never went without, and with which he effected many
strange cures.
The feats of Kelly, " Speculator" to Dr. Dee, may be
read in the life of the last-named writer. Of Dr. Dee him-
self and the spirits Ash, II, Po, Va, and many others, who
used to <).ppear to him, by Kelly's ministry, in a beryl,
much may be found in Merie Casaubon's Relation of what
passed for many years between Dr. john Dee and some
spirits. This narrative comprises the transactions of
four-and-twenty years, from 1583 to 1607. Familiars

Fascination : From Latin fascinare, to enchant. The word
in its general acceptation signifies charm, enchant, to
bewitch, by the eyes, the looks ; generally, to charm or
enchant ; to bold or keep in thraldom by charms. by
powers of pleasing.
A belief in Fascittatiou (strictly so called) appears to have
been very generally prevalent in most -.gcs and countries.
For its existence in Greece and Rome we may q\\ote the
wish of Theocritus that an old woman mi~ht be with him
to avert this ill by spitting, or the complamt of !\Ienalcas.
in Virgil, that some evil eye has fascinated his lambs. The
Romans, indeed, with the1r usual passion for increasing the
host of heaven, deified this power of ill, and enrolled a god
" fascinus " among their objects of worship. Although
he was a" numen," the celebration of his rites was intrusted
by a singular incongruity, to the care of the vestal virgins;
and his phallic attribute was suspended round the necks
of children and from the .triumphal chariots. Lucretius,
writing Of Natural WitchcYaft joY Love, etc., says : " But
as there is jascinatio11 and witchcraft by malicious and
angry eyes unto displeasure. so are there witching aspects
tending contrariwise to love, or, at the least, to the procur-
ing of good will and liking. For if thcjasci11ation or witch-
r,raft be brought to pass or provoked by the desire. by the
wishing or coveting any beautiful shape or favour, the
venom is strained through the eyes, though it be from afar,
and the imagination of a beautiful form resteth in the heart
of the lover, and kindlcth the fire where it is afflicted.
And because the most delicate, sweet and tender blood of
the beloved doth there wander, his countenance is there
represented, shining in his OV.'ll blood, and cannot there
be quiet, and is so haled from thence, that the blood of him
that is wounded, reboundetb, and slippeth into the
wounder."
Varius, Prior of the Benedictine Convent of Sta. Sophia
in Benevento, published a Treatise, De Fascino, in r589.
He firstpointstowhole nations which have been reported to
possess the power offascination. Thus theidolatrous" Biar-
bi" and "Hamaxobii," on the authority of Olaus Magnus,
are represented to be " most deeply versed in the art of
fascinating men, so that by witchcraft of the eyes, or words,
or of aught else (a very useful latitude of expression) they
so compel men that they are no longer free, nor of sane
understanding, and often are reduced to extreme emaci-
ation, and perish by a wasting disease." He then proceeds
to similar marvels concerning animals. Wolves, if they
see a man first, deprive him of all power of speech ; a fact
yet earlier from Theocritus. The shadow of the hyama.
produces the same caect upon a dog ; and this sagacious
wild beast is so well acqua1nted with its own virtue, that
whenever it finds dog or man sleeping. its first care is to
stretch its length by the side of the slumberer, and thus
ascertain his comparative ma~nitude with its ov.'ll. Ifitself
be larger of the two, then it 1S able to afflict its prey with
madness, apd it fearlessly begins to nibble his hands or
paws (whichever they may be) to prevent resistance; if
it be smaller, it quietly runs away. It may be as well to
know, (though ·not immediatelr bearing on fascinatUJ?J),
that an attack from an hyrena, i it approaches on the right
hand, is peculiarly dangerous ; if from the left, it may be
beaten o11 without much trouble. Lastly, tortoises lay
Fascination 157
their eggs and afterwards hatch them, as is very credibly
affirmed, by virtue of their eyes alone.
The tenth chapter of the First Book of Vairus inquires:
" An aliqui se fascinare possint ? " a question which is
decided in the affirmative, by the example of the Basilisk
of Narcissus, and of one less known, though equally un-
fortunate. Eutelis. In the twelfth chapter be a.ffi.rms, that
the more wicked any person is, the better is he adapted
to exercise evil fascinc.tion. From this book we may
extract two useful cautions: " Let no servant ever hire
himself to a squinting master, and let jewellers be cautious
to whose hands, or rather eyes, they intrust their choicest
wares." A friend of Vairus told him, that he bad seen a
person who was gifted with an eye ofsuch fascinating power,
that once while he was looking attentively on a precious
stone of fine water, exquisite cutting, and admirable polish,
in the hands of a lapidary, the jewel of its own accord split
into two parts.
In his Second Book, after disputing against " natural "
fascination, which he treats as visionary, Vairus determines
that all fascination is an evil power, attained by tacit or
open compact with the devil.
A second writer on this matter is John Lazarus Gutierrez,
a Spanish physician, who may be believed to be equally
well qualified for the consideration of mys~ery. His
Opusculum de Fasci110 appeared in 1653. On his own
experience he does not state much, but in his Dubilcm (III.)
be cites Mendoza for an account of a servant of a Tyrolese
nobleman, who could bring down a falcon from her very
highe~t flight by steadily looking at her. From Antonius
Carthaginensis, also, he produces two other wonders.
The first. of a man in Guadalazara, who was in the habit of
breaking mirrors into minute fragments solely by looking
at them ; the second. of another in Ocana, who used to
kill his own children, as well as those of other folks, by the
contagion of his eyes ; nay. still more, occasionally, in like
manner, to be the cause of death to many valuable horses.
From Cardan, Gutierrez extracts the following symptoms
by wltich a physician may determine that his patient is
fascino.ted :-Loss of colour, heavy and melancholy eyes,
either overflowing with tears or unnaturally dry, frequent
sighs. and lowness of spirits, watchfulness, bad dreams,
falling away of llesh. Also, if a coral or jacinth worn by
him loses its colour, or i1 a ring, made of the hoof of an ass,
put on his finger, grows too big for him after a few days'
wearing. According to the same writer, tl:ie Persians used
to determine the sort otfascinatiolt under which the patient
laboured, by binding a clean linen cloth round his head,
letting it dry there, and remarking whether any and what
spots arose on it.
But the most curious fact which we learn from Gut-
ierrez is that the Spanish children in his time wore amulets
against fascination, somewhat resembling those in use
among the Romans. The son of Gutierrez himself wore
one of these ; it was a cross of jet, (" agavache ") and it
was believed that it would split if regarded by evil eyes,
thus transferring their venom from the child upon itself.
In point of fact, the amulet worn by young Gutierrez did
so split one day, while a person was steadfastly looking at
him; and, in justice to the learned physician, we must add,
that he attributes the occurrence to some accidental cause.
and expresses his conviction that the same thing would
have happened under any other circumstances. Through-
out his volume, indeed, all his reasoning is brought forward
to explode the superstition.
A third similar work is that of John Christian Fromman,
a physician of Saxe-Coburg, who published his Tractattts
de Fascinatiot~e in 1675.
We have already learned from Vairus, that all those who
are immoderately praised, especially behind their backs,
Fascination
persons of fair complexion, and of handsome face or figure,
particularly children, are most exposed to fascination, and
this notion probably arose from such children attracting
from strangers more attention than others less indebted
to nature. It was an impression of his own personal beauty
which induced Polyphemus to put in practice the spitting
charm which Cotattaris had taught him. So we read in The-
ocritus, Frommann adds, that children in unwashed baby
linen are easily subject to fascination, and so also is any
fair one who employs two lady's maids to dress her hair ;
moreover, that aU those who lie in bed very late in the
morning, especially if they wear nightcaps, all who break
their fast on cheese or peas, and all children who, having
been once weaned. are brought back to the breast, will,
even against their inclination, be gifted with the power of
fascinating both men and beasts.
In order to ascertain whether a child be fascinated, three
oak apples may be dropped into a basin of water under its
cradle, the person who drops them observing the strictest
silence ; if they swim the child is free, if they sink it is
affected; or a slice of bread may be cut with a knife marked
with three c:rosses. and both the bread and the knife left
on th~> child's pillow for a night; if marks of rust appear
in the morning the child is fascinated. If on licking the
child's forehead with your tongue a. salt taste is perceived,
this also is an infallible proof of fascinatioll.
The following remedies against fascinatiou rest upon
the authorities either of Vairus or Frommann, or both of
them ; several of them may be traced to Pliny :-An invo-
cation of Nemesis ; the root of the " Satyrios Orchis ;"
the skin of a br.rena's forehead ; the kernel of the fruit of
a palm tree; ' Alyssum " (m~dwort) hung up anywhere
in the house; the stone " Catochites ;" spitting on the
right shoe before it be put on ; hyssop ; lilies ; fumiga-
tions ; sprinklin~ ; necklaces of jacinth, sapphire, or
carbuncle; washings in river water, provided silence be
kept ; licking a child's forehead, first upward, next across,
and lastly up again, and then spitting behind its back ;
sweeping its face with the bough of a pine tree ; laying it
on the ground, covered up in a linen cloth, and then sprink-
ling it in the form of a cross, with three handfuls of earth,
dug where the eaves drop, and brought thence at three
separate times within an hour : laying turf from a boy's
grave under a boy's pillow, from a girl's under a girl's ;
silently placing near a child the clothes in which it was
baptized ; if, as is sometimes the case, a child appears to
derive no benefit from washing, taking three scrapings
from the plaster of each of the four walls of its bedroom,
and sprinkling them on its linen; three "lavements" of
three spoonfuls of milk : giving in a drink the ashes of a
rope in which a man has been hanged ; drawing water
silently, and throwing a lighted candie into it in the name
of the Holy Trinity, then washing the patient's legs in this
water, and throwing the remainder behind its back in the
form of a cross; hanging up the key of the house over the
child's cradle; laying on it crumbs of bread, a lock with
the bolt shut, a looking-glass, or some coral washed in the
font in which it was baptized; hanging round its neck
fennel seeds, or bread and cheese.
Vairus states, that huntsmen, as a protection against
fascination, were used to split an oak plant, and pass them-
selves and their dogs between it. As amulets against love
fascination, be recommends sprinkling with the dust in
which a mule has rolled itself ; a bone which may be found
in the right side of a toad ; or the liver of a chameleon.
Vida has given a highly elaborate description of one who
possessed this destructive power in his eye, after enjoining
especial caution respecting those who are permitted to look
at the silkworms. Some instances of yet more modern

After gazing on the apparition for a few seconds, she bent
her eyes upon her husband to ascertain if his looks were
turned in the direction of the window, but his eyes were
closed. She turned round again, although now dreading
the sight of what she believed to be her husband's fetch,
but it was no longer there. She remained sleepless through-
out the remainder of the night, but still bravely refrained
.from disturbin~ her partner.
"Kext morrung, Mr. B., seeing signs of disquiet on his
wife's countenance while at breakfast, made some affec-
tionate inquiries, but she concealed her -trouble, and at his
ordinary hour he sallied forth to make his calls. Meeting
Dr. C, in the street, and falling into conversation with him,
he asked his opinion on the subject of fetches. ' I think,'
was the answer, • and so I am sure do you, that they are
mere illusions produced by a disturbed stomach acting
UJ?<>D the excited brain of a highly imaginative or super-
stitious person.' • Tben,' said Mr. B., • I am highly im-
aginative or superstitious, for I distinctly saw my own
outward man last night standing at the table in the bed-
room, and clearly distinguishable in the -moonlight. Jam
afraid my wife saw it too, but I have been afraid to speak
to her on the subject.'
" About the same hour on the ensuing mght the poor lady
was again roused, but by a more painful circumstance.
She felt her husband moving convulsively, and immediately
afterwards he cried to her in low, interrupted accents,
• Elleo, my dear, I am suffocating; send for Dr. C.' She
sprang up, huddled on some clothes, and ran to his house.
He came with all speed, 'but his efforts for his friend were
useless. He had burst a large blood-vessel in the lungs,
and was soon beyond human aid. In her lamentations
the bereaved wife frequently cried out, ' Oh I the fetch,
the fetch I' and at a later period told the doctor of the
appearance the mght before her husband's death.
Fetishism : The term fetishism is employed in more than
one sense. Thus it may mean in some cases pure)dolatry
oa the worship of inanimate objects. ~ain in older works
of travel, it is even used to signify Afncan religion. But
taken in its general and more modem sense, it signifies any
inanimate object which appears to the savage as the resi-
dence of a spu:it. Thus a carved doll, a necklace of teeth,
a flint stone into which a shaman or medicine-man bas
succeeded in coaxing a spirit to reside, is regarded by the
savage as a fetish. Dut larger objects are occasionally
adopted as fetishes, and in the adoption of these in contra-
distinction to the smaller fetishes we can trace the evolution
of the idol. As a general rule the fetish is an object peculiar
in shape or material, for such is considered by the shaman
as being more likely to attract a wandering spirit than any
more ordinary substance. Thus we find as fetishes pecu-
liarly shaped stones, tufts of human hair and bones, parts
of animals and birds, and so forth. Fossils are not
uncommonly employed as fetishes, possibly because of
their freakish formation.
The origin of fetishism is undoubtedly animistic (See
Animism). The savage intelligence regards everything that
surrounds it. as possessing the property of life-water, the
earth, trees, stones and so forth. But this is modified by
the idea that many of these objects are under the power
of some spell or potent enchantment. Thus the rocks and
trees are the living tombs of imprisoned spirits. resembling
the dryads of folk-lore; so that it is not at all strange to
the savage mind to perceive an imprisoned intelligence
more or less powerful, in any object, no matter how un-
co~mon its form. ln fact, according to the savage mind,
somt was dependent to a great extent upon material body.
Tbe wandering spirit, according to the barbarian, could
not fare much better, materially speaking, than a wander-
ing savage : it would suffer the rigours of hunger and cold,
Fetishism
and would be only too agreeable to be at rest for a while
where it would be treated with every deference and properly
attended to. For this purpose a shaman will either manu-
facture or search for a fitting residence for this spirit, and
he will proceed by various rites to attempt to coax some
wandering intelligence to take up its home therein.
There is of course a point at which the fetish commences
to develop into a god. This happens when fetishes survive
the test of experience and achieve a more than personal
or tribal popularity. Thus amongst the Zulli Indians a
fetish called " The Knife·feathered Monster" bas prac-
tically become the tribal god of war, and a pony and sheep
fetish are at present in course of evolving as deities in the
pantheon of this people. Amongst the Zulli there appears
to have been the conception that their fetishes were
totemistic. Fetishism and totemism arc not imcompatible
with one another, but often flourish side by side ; but the
basic difference between a fetish and a totem is that the
fetish spirit is the bond slave of the person who owns its
abode, whereas the totem is his patron spirit, personal or
tribal. Nevertheless the fetish partakes more of the nature
of those spirits which are subservient to man, as for example
the Arabian Jinn, than of those which subsequently develop
into gods. They are more of the race of f&cry, of the little
folk who dwelt in the crevices of rocks and trees, the smaller
swarm of the supernatural, than of the strain of Olympus.
A capital example of a fetish, which will be familiar to all,
is that which occurs in the story of Aladdin and his lamp.
Here we have the subservient nature-spirit-the original
conception of which must have been that it dwelt in the
lamp or the ring, and was only freed therefrom on the sum-
mons of its temporary master to perform some special
piece of work. Dut a fetish is not necessarily a piece of
personal property : it may belong collectively to an entire
community or family, and it is usually an heirloom.
The sava!?e naturally attaches great import~nce to those
fetishes wh1ch assist him in the chase. Thus the Zuili
Indians, wlto possess perhaps the most complete fetishistic
system of any barbarous people, have. a special temple-
house set apart for their tribal fetishes of the hunt, which
they call the Prey-gods. On setting out for the hunt, the
Zwii. Indian will visit the fetish-bouse, and sprinkle a little
maize meal on a platter placed before that fetish which
he wishes to employ in h1s expedition. In this office be
is usually assisted by a medicine-man set aside for the
purpose, whose special duty it is to sec that the fetishes
are properly placated and returned when their services
are no more required. Let us suppose that be selects the
fetish of the mountain-lion. This is a stone object, shaped
in the likeness of that animal. Once in the open country,
the hunter places the mouth of the fetish to his own and
suspires deeply, imagining that by so doing he is breathing
in the hunting instinct of the mountain-lion. He then
forcibly emits his breath. The Indian idea is that beasts
of prey are able by the emission of breath to render the
game helpless over a wide area, and this the hunter believes
he has successfully and ma~;ically imitated. When he
meets with his game, after slaymg it, his first act is to excise
the liver, which he smears upon the lips of the fetish, which
is then duly returned to t he fetish-house. Most of the
objects belonging to a medicine-man or shaman are believed
to be fetishes,- that is, they possess a certain quality of
life that other, and more ordinary, objects do not have.
The word fetish is derived from the Portuguese feitifO
which implies "something made," and was applied by
early voyagers in West Africa to the wooden figures, stones
and so forth, regarded as the residence ofspirits. Fetishism
in Africa appears to be generally confined to the coasts,
but in America it is prevalent more or less over the whole
hemisphere. That it was once prevalent in Europe is
Fey 160 FigUier
practically certain from the nature of many objects found
in prehistoric and early historic graves, and in certain parts
of Asia, ii is by no means extinct. The material conception
of fetishism survives in the charm, amulet or mascot, which
is regarded as a luck-bringer, although the spiritual sig-
nificance connected with it has quite vanished. (See
Charms and Amulets, Famillar).

to-day, really begins with the Elizabethan age ; for the

elicit comparatively little interest nowadays save among
experts. And, by the time of Elilabeth's advent. the old
•· miracle plays " had gone out of fao;hion; yet tales about
the miraculous doings of mythical heroes continued to
find favour, and many new things of this kind were
written.
A few of the Restoration dramatists dealt in magic and
the like, but throughout the ~oq~ian age people were
mos~ly too prosaic, too matter-of-fact, to care for things
of that sort, and they were eschewed by the majority of
prominent writers of the day. However, after the great
artistic movement commonly styled the Renaissance of
Wonder, the old interest in the occult began to revive apace,
and, ere the nineteenth century was very far advanced, a
literature suitable to this budding taste was being purveyed
on a voluminous scale. Among the first to enter the lists,
soi disant, was William Godwin, with his novel of
St. Truyne the Rosicrucian ; while Godwin's daughter,
Mary, chiefly remembered nowadays as the second wife
of Shelley, merits notice as·a mystical writer by virtue of
her story of Frankenstein. A little before the advent of
this authoress, numerous occult tales had been written
by Matthew Lewis, notably Tales of Terror and the drama
of Castle Spectre, staged successfully at Drur}' L:ln~ in 1798;
while not long after Lewis a further novelist came to swelt
the muster-roll. Bulwer Lytton, whose taste !or the mystic
is seen especially in Zanoni, A Strange Story, and Haunters
atld the Hatmted. His essays of this kind, nevertheless,
were never very satisfactory in the real literary sense ;
and as Leslie Stephen once discovered. they too often
smacked of the theatrical. But Sir Walter Scott, on
the other hand, writing just before Lytton's time. not
only showed a keen fondness for occult m3tter, but
frequently utilised it to genuine artistic purpose. In The
Monastery a mysterious sylph rises from a fountain; as-
trology is introduced into Guy j\[amaering, The Fortunes
of Nigel, and Quentin Durward; while a splendid ghost
story is told in J?edgauntlet, and ghosts figure also in Wood-
stock. In The Dride of l.ammermoor, besides, the author
deals incidentally with that firm belief in prophecy which
was _Ion~ a prominent part of Scottish life ; while in Waver-
ley, agam, he depicts a Highland chief as awestruck and
unmanned by tbe sight of a peculiar omen. Highland
superstitions, indeed, appealed with particular potency
to Sir Walter's romantic temper; while he was not the
only writer of his time who de:1lt ably with this branch of
the occult, another being Susan Ferrier in her novels of
Destiny and The Chief's Daughter. Nor should we fail ere
leaving this period, to mention Ann Radcliffe, for in
almost all her novels the supernatural figures promi-
nently.
While the last-named trio were at work thus in Britain,
some good stories in which magic occurs were being written
in America by Washington Irving ; and, not very long
after his day, a second American arose to treat brilliantly
of weirdness and wizardry, Edgar Allan Poe. Then, re-
verting to England, ghosts appear in a few of Dickens'
novels, and Charles Reade manifests here and there a love
of the occult; while coming to slightly later times, a writer
who manifested this predilection abundantly is Robert
Louis Stevenson. His Dr. jekyll attd Mr. Hyde is among
the best of all modern novels in which the supernatural
plays a salient role, and m:Lny of his short stories pertain
also to the category of occult, for example, the tale of the
magic bottle in Tsla"d Nights Entertainments; while, about
the date these were being cot;nposed, Oscar Wilde was
writing what is one of the most beautiful things de31ing
wjth invisible powers, Th1 Piaure of Dorian' Gray. Much
inferior to this masterpiece, yet possessing considerable
excellence, are Gcvrge d u :'>faurier's Peter Ibbetson, Trilby
and The Martian, in each of which the supernatural is
prominent ; while a further work which should certainly
be cite9 is Lafcadio Hearn's Dead Love, a tiny tale of magic
which the author thought lightly of, but which future
generations are almost sure lo prize on account of its lovely
wordin~. at some places worthy of Th6ophile Gautier him-
self, who was Hearn's acknowleJged m:lster.
These recent authors do not by any me:1ns conclude the
list, for a wealth of occult fiction has been written since
their day. Among its most remarkable item• is The Ghost
Ship of Richard Middleton, a singularly promising story-
teller and poet who died by his own hand lately at the early
age of twenty-nine; while many contemporary novelists
have introduced m:lgic into their. books, for instance, Mr.
Rider Haggud in She, the late Mr. Bram Stoker in Dracula,
and Mr. F. A. Anstey in Vice VeYsa and The Brass Bottle. In
fact, were one to cite all the living wont to trade in the
occult, an article of formidable size would be the result, and
accordingly the attempt must be eschewed ; but at 'least
it is essential to mention Mr. Theodore W~tts-Dunton's
Aylwin. this refiecting re:tlly fine treatment of mystic m:lt·
ter, and being couched thro:~ghout in a style of exceptional
beauty. :'>fr. Arthur Symon~ is another great writer of
to-day who loves the borderland between dreams and
realities, as witness many p:Lges in his Spirituai Adventures;
\ll'hilc the invisible world has always appealed powerfully
to 1\fr. W. B. Yeats, and is employed to good purpose here
and there in his stories of the Irish peas:1ntry. It is les!.
the ghost than the fairy which he delights in, true Celt that
he is; and his predjlection herein sets one dreaming of
fairy-tales in general, and summons a curio.us medley of
n:Lmes. William :'>!orris wrote a host of beautiful biry-
stories, some of them concerned with the promulgation
of socialistic idea~. but others innocent of anything of that
sort; while the voluminous works of Ruskin include what
can only be defined as a fairy talc, The Ki111: ofthe Golden
River. Numerous contemporary \vtitcrs have likewise
done good work in this Jicl<l-Lord Duns.·my. llir. J. M.
Barrie, and more especially i\:lr. L:~.urcncc Housroan-while
a remarkable fairy play has been written lately by Mr.
Graham Robertson, and has been staged with surprising
triumph. Then, reverting for a moment to defunct authors,
fairies occur in that channing volume by H. D. Lowry,
Maka Believe, and in Richard Middleton's book, Tl1e Day
Before Yesterday; while no account of this particular
domain of literature would be complete without mention of
the work of Lewis Carrol, and also of Jean Ingelow's lovely
story, ]"fopsa tile Fairy. This last is possibly the best of
all fairy stories, and one which has been most widely and
wisely cherished ; and it stands out very clearly in the
memory of nearly every man of imagin11.tive temperament,
reminding him of his own childhood.

exchanged this post for a similar one in the Schoolof Phar-
macy of Paris. Thereafter many honorary degrees in science
and medicine were conferred upon him by various faculties.
In 1857 he finally left off teaching and devoted himself to
the popularising of science, mainly physiology and medical
<:hemistry. He published from time to time many notable
works, and was not more distinguished for his prodigious
output than for its literary quality. Of those works having
a bearing on occult matters the principal are: le Lentkmain
tk Ia morl ou La Vie future selon Ia scunu (187:2) dealing
with the transmigration of souls; l' Alchimie et les Al-
chimistes (1854) ; Ilistoire du mervei/leux dans les temps
motkrnes (r 859-6o ); les Bonheurs d' outre lombe (1892.)
He tried to popularize science by introducing on the stage
plays whose heroes were savants and inventors. His at-
tempt however, met \nth but a cold reception. In r889

att Theatre. He died at Paris in 1894.
Fingitas : The tradition concerning this stone is remarkable.
It fs described as quite transparent and hard like marble.
It is related that a certain king built a temple of it which
needed no windows, the light being admitted into it as if
it had been all open to the day.
F!nlas : One of the four great cities whence the Irish mythical
Danaans "'ere said to have sprung.
Flnn Mae Cumrnal : In Irish romance, Captain of the Fianna
and the centre of the Ossianic tales. His father Cumhal,
chief of the clan Basena, was slain at Castle Knock by the
rival clan Morna, but his mother ·succeeded in saving him
from the enemy. He was brought up in hiding and given
the name of Fitm from the clearness of his skin. He
learned science and poetry from the druid Finegas who
d welt on 'the river Boyne. The d.ruid had been unable
to catch the salmon of knowledge until Fintz became his
pupil, and when he did succeed in catching it, he told Fin11
to watch it while it was cooking but not to partake of it.
Finn, however, burned his fingers as he turned the spit
and put one of them in his mouth. Seeing this, Finegas
bade him eat the salmon and he became filled with the
wisdom of all ages. Afterwards he took service with King
Cormac to whom he revealed his name and lineage. Cor-
mac promised him the leadership of the Fianna if he suc-
ceeded in killing the fire-blowing demon that came year!y
to set Tara in fiamcs. Fitm slew the demon and bore his
head back to Tara. The Fianna were therefore ordered
to swear allegiance to Fir.n as their captain, which, led
by Goll mac Morna, their former captain, they all did.
Under Finn, the Fianna rose to great eminence, an eminence
which at length became tyrannical and from which they
were thrown at the battle of Bowra. Finn's end is
shrouded in mystery. According to popular tradition he
and hls great companions lie sleeping in an enchanted cave
whence they shall arise in the hour of their country's need,
like Arthur, Barbarossa and Charlemagne.
Fioravanti, Leonardi : An Italian alchemist doctor a nd
surgeon of the sixteenth century. He was a voluminous
writer ~~ose best known work is a S~1mmary of the Arcana
of Med,c•ne, Surgery and Alchemy, published in Venice in
t57r. It embraces an application of the principles and
met hods of Hermes to the Science of Medicine. The au-
tho~'s account of the petra philosophorum shews its desig-
n~tion to be pur«:lY arb~trary: It is a mixture of mercury,

Fire : Many nations have adored this element. In Persia
~ chinineyless enclosure was made, and into it fire was
mtroduced. Essences and perfumes were cast into the
fire by the great persons of the nation. When a Persian
Iring was at the point of death all t he fires in the principal
towns of the kingdom were extinguished, and were not
rekindled until the crowning of his successor. Certain
Tartars never accost foreigners who have not purified them-
selves by passing between two fires ; they are also careful
to drink with their faces turned to the south, in honour
of the element of fire. In some paris of Siberia it is be-
lieved that fire is inhabited by a being who dispenses good
and evil ; they offer him perpetual sacrifices. According
to the kabalists, this was the element of the Salamanders.
(See also Fire Ordeal.)
Fire, Magical : (See Magic.)

Fire-ordeal : The fire-ordeal is of gTeat antiquity, and prob-
ably arose from the conception of the purifying ioftuence
of fire. Among the Hindoos, from the earliest times until
comparatively recently, those who were suspected of wrong-
doing were required to prove their guilt or innocence by
walking over red-hot iron. If they escaped unharmed
their innocence was placed beyond a doubt. The
priestesses of a Cappodocian goddess, Diana Parasya,
walked barefooted on red-hot coals, attributing their in-
vulnerability to the powers of the divinity. In Europe
trial by :fire was of two kinds-traversing the fiames, or
undergoing the ordeal of hot iron. The latter form com-
prised the carrying in the hand of red-hot irons, the walking
over iron bars or glowing ploughshares, and the thrusting
of the hand into a red-hot gauntlet. An early instance
of the former mode in European history is that of Pierre
Barthelemy, who in 1097 declared to the Crusaders that
heaven had revealed to him the place where was concealed
the spear that had pierced the Saviour's body. To prove
his assertion he offered to undergo the ordeal by fire, and
was d uly required to walk a path about a foot in width
and some fourteen feet in length, on either side of which
were piled blazing olive-branches. The judgment of the
fire was unfavourable, and twelve days later the rash ad-
venturer expired in agony. Books also were sometimes
submitted to the trial by fire. This method was adopted
to decide the claims of the Roman and ~lo:z:aratian liturgies,
the former emerging victorious from the flames. Among
savage people the fire-ordeal is also to be met with. and
especially in New Zealand, India, Fiji, and Japan. It may be
suspected that the issue of these ordeals was not always left
on the knees of the gods. There is no doubt that the an-
cient Egyptians were acquainted with substances which
rendered the body partly immune. Albertus Magnus
gives a recipe for this purpose. It is made up of powdered
lime, made into a paste with the white of an egg. the juice
of the radish, the juice of the marsh mallow, and the seeds
of the fleabane. A first coat of this mixture is applied to
the body and allowed to dry, when a second coat is applied.
If the feet be constantly oiled, or moistened with sulphuric
acid, they may be rendered impervious. Possibly the
ancients were not unaware of the fire-resisting propertie3
of asbestos. The fire-ordeal has remained to this day as
one of the phenomena of spiritualism. D. D. Home fre-
quently handled live coals, and laid them on a handkerchief
without damaging the material in the least. On one occa-
sion he enclosed a glowing coal in his hands and blew upon
it until it became white hot. A weU known instance is
that related by Mrs. S. C. Hall. when Home placed a burn-
ing coal on the head of Mr. Hall, whose white hair was then
drawn over the still glowing coal. In an account given
by :Mrs. Homewood and Lord Lindsay of a seance with
the same medium we are told that Home took a chimney
from a lighted lamp and thrust it into the fire, making it
so hot that a match applied to it ignited inst;mtly, and
then thrust it into his moutq, touching it'with his tongue.
without any apparent ill effects. Another account states
FlameI 162 Fludd
that Home placed his face right in the fire among the burn-
ing coals !' moving it about as though bathing it in water."
Other mediums, both in England and America, emulated
tbis feat with some measure of success. It has been
suggested that the state of trance generally accompanying
such exploits, and corresponding to the ecstasy of the
shaman performing a similar feat, may produce ancesthesia,
or insensibility to the pain of burning. But how it comes
that the skin is not scorched, nor the material of the hand-
herc.hief marked by the burning coal, it is not easy to say.
Flame!, Nicholas, was born at Pontoise, of a poor but respect-
able family, about the beginning of the fourteenth century.
He received a good education, of which his natural abilities
enabled him to make the best use. Repairing to Paris,
he obtained employment as a public scrivener,-sitting
at the corner of the Rue de Marivaux, copying or inditing
letters and other documents. The occupation brought
\Vith it little profit, and Flame/ tried in succession poetry
and painting with an equally unsatisfactory result. His
quick wits sug~ested that as he could make no money by
teaching mankind, it might be more profitable to cheat
them, and be took up the pursuit of Astrology, casting
horoscopes and telling fortunes. He was right in his con-
jectures, and soon throve so vigorously that he was enabled
to take unto himseU a wile named Petronella. But those
who begin to study the magic art for profit or amusement
generally finish by addicting themselves to it with a blindly
passionate love. Nicholas devoted himself both day and
night to his fascinating but deceptive pursuits; and soon
acquired a thorough knowledge of all that previous adepts
had written upon the eliKir vitee, the universal Alkahest,
and the Philosopher's Stone. In 1297 he lighted upon a
manual of the ll.rt which would have been invaluable if it
bad been intelligible. He bought it for two florins. It
contained three times seven leaves written with a steel
instrument upon the bark of trees. The caligraphy was
as admirable as the Latin was cryptical. Each seventh
leaf was free from writing, but t!mblatoned with a picture ;
the first, representing a serpent swallo"'ing rods; tlte
second, a serpent crucified on a cross ; and the third, the
arid expanse of a treeless desert, in whose depths a fountain
bubbled, with serpents trailing their slimy folds from side
to side. The author of this mysterious book purported
to be "Abraham, the patriarch, Jew, prince, philosopher,
Levite, priest, and astrologer," (q.v.) who added to his
other claims upon the wonder of mankind a knowledge
of I..atin. He had included within these precious pages
a complete exposition of the art of transmuting metals;
describing every process, explaining the different vessels,
and pointing out the proper s~asons for making experiments.
In fact, the book would have been perfect, but for one
deficiency ; it was addressed not so much to the tyro as
to an adept, and took it for granted that its student was
already in possession of the Philosopher's Stone. This
was a terrible obstacle to the inquiring Flamcl. The more
he studied the book the less be understood it. He studied
the letterpre~s. and he studied the illustrations ; he invited
the wise men of France to come and study them, but no
light was thrown upon the darkness. For thrice seven
years he pored over these perplexing pages, until at length
his wife suggested tha t a Jewish Rabbi might be able to
interpret them. As the chiefs of the JP.ws were principally
located in Spain, to Spain went Flame/, and there he re-
mained for two y~ars. From one of the Hebrew sages he
obtained some hints which afforded a key to the patriarchal
mysteries, and returning to Paris be recommenced his
studies· with a new vigour. They were rewarded ,~ith
success. On the 13th of February, 1382, o.s., Flame/ made
a projection on l.i<-rcury, and produced some virgin silver.
On the 25th of the following April be converted some Mer-
cury into gold, and found himseH the fortunate possessor
of an inexhaustible treasure. But Ius good fortune did
not end here. Flame/, continuing IUs researcltes discovered
the elixir of life, wbicb enabled him to prolong his life-
and accumulate gold- to the venerable age of r r6. He
further administered the life-giving potion to his "·ife,
who reached nearly as great a longevity as himself, d}'ing
in the year preceding h:s own death, A.D. qq. As they
had no children, ther spent their wealth upon churches
and hospital5, and several of the religious and charitable
institutions of Fmnce still attest their well-directed bene,·o-
lence. There is no doubt that Fl.:mzc/ practised alchemy,
and· one of hi~ works on the fas.:inating science-a poem
entitled The Pitilosopllic Summary-was printed as late
as I735· ln Salmon's valuable and very curious Bibllo-
theque des Philosophes Cizimiques are preserved same speci-
mens of the dnnvin~s in Abrah~m· s treatise on metallurgy
and of his own handwriting. But Flame! was neither an
enthusiast nor a duoe. His alchemical studies were but
the disguises of his- usurious practices. To account for
the immense wealth he acquired by money-lending to the
young French nobles,. and by transacting business between
the Jews of France and those of Spain, he invented the
fiction of his discovery of the Philosopher's Stone. He
nevertheless obtai ned great repute as a magician, and his
followers believed that he was still alive though retired
from the world, and would live for six centuries.

Fludd, or Flud, Robert : This Rosicrucian and alchemist
was born in 1574 at .lltilgate House, in the parish of Bear-
sted, Kent, Ius father being one Sir Thomas Fludd, a knight
who enjoyed the patronage of Queen Eli?.abcth, and served
her for several years as ·• Treasurer of \Yar in the Low·
Countries." At the age of seventeen Robert entered St.
John's College, Oxford, and five rears la~er he took his
degree as Bachelor of Arts ; while shortly afterwards, on
bis deciding to take up medical science, he left England
and went to prosecute his st~:dies on the Continent. Going
first to Spain, be travelled thence to Italy, and subsequently
stayed ior some time in Germany, where he is said to have
supported himself by acting as pedagogue in various noble
households; but soon he was home again, and in 1605 his
alma maier of Oxford conferred on him the degrees of Bach-
elor of Medicine and Doctor of ~Iedicine, while five years
later he became a Fellow of the College of Physicians.
Having thus equipped himself thoroughly for the medical
profession, Fludd went to London and took a house in
Fenel1urch Street, a quiet place in those days, though now
a noisy centre of commerce; and here he soon gained an
extensive practice, his success being due not merely to his
genuine skill, but to his ha,'ing an attractive and even
magnetic personality. But busy though he was in this
way, he found leisure to write at length on medicine ; while
anon he became an important and influential member of
the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross, and at the same time
be commenced alchemistlc experiments. lie preached
the great efficacy of the magnet, of sympathetic cures, of
the weapon-salve : he declared Ills belief in the Philoso-
pher's Stone, the universal alkahest or solvent, the elixir
vita ; he maintained that all things were animated by two
principles- condensation, the Boreal, or northern virtue ;
and rarefaction, the Austral, or southern virtue. He
asserted that the human body was controlled by a number
of demons, that each disease had its peculiar demon, each
demon his particular place in the frame of humanity, and
that to conquer a disease-say in the right leg-you must
call in the aid of the demon who ruled the left, always
Flute 163 Fonteoettes
proceeding by this rule of contraries. As soon as the doc-
trines of the Rosy Cross Brotherhood were promulgated
Fludd embraced them with aU the eagerness of which his
dreamy intellect was capable; and several German writers
having made an attack upon them, he published a defence
in 1616, under the title of Apologia Compendiaria Ft'a~rn­
itaiem de Rosea-Cruce Suspicionis et Infamia Maculis Asper-
sam Abluens, which procured him a wide-spread reputation
as one of the apostles of the new fraternity. He met with
the usual fate of prophets, and was lustily belaboured by
a l:ost of enemies--by Merscnne, Gasscndi, and Kepler.
Flutld v:as by no means discomfited, and retorted upon
his opponents in an elaborate treatise, Summum Bonum,
quod est Magia, Cabalt8, Alchimia, Fralrmn Roset8-Crucis
Vuortlm, et advet'sus Mtt'senium Calumn·iatorcm. H~ made
at a later period and aventurous attempt to identify the
doctrines of the Rosicrucians with what he was pleased
to call the Philosophy of Moses (Philosophia .Mosaica, in
qua sapientia et scietllia Creationis explicantur), published at
Ghent, 1638, and wrote numerous treatises on alchemy and
medical scir.nce. He founded an English schooJ of Rosi-
crucians. Fludd is one of the high priests of the Magnetic
Philosophy, and learnedly expounds the laws of ostral
medicine, the doctrines of sympathies, and the fine powers
and marvellous effects of the magnet. When two men
approach each other-such was his theory-their mag-
netism is either active or passive; that is, positive or
negative. If the emanations which they send out are
broken or thrown back, there arises antipathy, or Mag-
netismus mgativus : but when tile emanations pass through
each oilier, the positive magnetism is produced, for the
magnetic rays proceed from the centre to the cil'cum!erence.
Man, like the earth, has his poles, or two main streams of
magnetic influence. Like a little world, he is endowed
witll a magnetic virtue which, however, is' subjected to
the same laws as, on a larger scale, the magnetic power
of the universe. How these principles may be developed
in tllc cure or prevention of disease, the reader must learn
from the mystic pages of Robertus aFluctibus himself.
Flttdd died in 1637 at a house in Coleman Street, to which
he had removed a few years before ; but ere his demise
he had won alairly wide reputation by his chymical ability,
and had also issued a considerable number of books, promi-
nent among them being Traclalus .ApologeJicus integrita-
lcm Societatis de Rusae Cruce dtfendans, Leyden 1617, Veri-
tatis Proscenium, Frankfort 16:u, Mtdir.it1a Catholica,

Flute, Charm or the : The flute is often mentioned in history
as being used for the purpose of charming animals. and
the serpent seems to have been peculiarly delighted with
its music. It is said that adders will swell at the sound
of the :flute, raising themselves up, twisting about and
keeping proper time. A Spanish writer says that in India
he had often seen tile Gentiles leading about enchanted
serpents, making them dance to the sound of a flute, put-
ting them round their necks, and touching them ·without
harm; and to this day a musical instrument of this nature
is used by tile snake-charmers of that country. In oppo-
sition to this, Hippocrates mentions a man, Nicanor, who
fainted whenever he heard the sound of a flute.
Flying Dutchman, The : Sailors in Holland long believed
that a certain Dutch skipper, van Straaten by name, was
condemned as a penalty for his sins to sail for year after
year through the seas beating around the Cape of Storms,
this being the old name for the Cape of Good Hope ; and
crews returning to tile Zudyer Zee after voyaging in the
region aforesaid, usc to declared that they had seen van
Straaten's mysterious craft, and had fled from it in terror.
This legend is probably a very old one, albeit the exact
date at which it became current is indeterminate; and
it should be added that the story is found in the folklore
of various countries ~ic:!es Holland, notably Germany.
Several Germa.n versions call the ill-starred seaman von
Falkenberg, and maintain that it was not near South Africa,
but in the North Sea that his spectral barque commonly
hovered ; while some of them contend further that the
devil was wont to payperiodic visits to the captain on board
his ship, and that frequently the two were seen playing
dice on deck, the stakes at issue being von Falkenberg's
soul. The tale soon found its way from folk-lore into
actual literature, among tile greatest of those writers util-
ising it being Heinrich Heine, and in his rencering tile
sailor has a chance of salvation. That is to say, the fates
allow him to put foot on terra fi,.ma once every seven years ;
and if, during his brief period of respite, he contrives to
win the afiC<'tion oi an unsullied maiden, liberation !rom
perennial sea-wanc:lcring 'll.ill be granted him as reward.
Heine's form o the story appealed keenly to Wagner, who
was always prone to regard woman cevoutly as before all
else a regenerating force ; and accordingly the great com-
poser wrote a music-drama on the subject of The Flying
Dutchman, or as he calls it in German, Der Fliegende Hol-
l<indet', in which the scene is mostly laid in the North Sea,
while the sailor himscU is called van DerC:ecken, and the
maiden to whom he makes advances is Senta. This opera
was first staged at Dresden in 1843, and, though it can
h?-rdly be said that it won speedy appreciation, at least.
it did not elicit quite the scorn meted out originally to the
majority of Wagner's works. Marryat has also a novel
on the subject. .

Fong-Cbur : A mysterious operation practised in China, in
the disposition of buildings, and l?articularly of tombs.
If someone should chance to build Jn a position contrary
to his neighbours, so that the corner of his house !aced the
side of a house bclongin~ to someone else, the latter believes
that the worst oi m1sfortune will befall him. Long-
standing feuds may result from the unfortunate action.
The remedy consists in placing in a chamber a C::ragon or
other monster in terra-cotta, facing the corner of the fatal
edifice. The terrible gaze of the monster will repulse the
evil influence. Incense is bu.rned before the cragon, and
he is treated with much respect.

Fontaine, J ohn : This Flemish alchemist and poet appears
to have lived at Valenciennes towarcs the close of the
thirteenth century. Two books ate ascribed to him, La
Fontaitze des Amout'eux de Science and La Fontaitze Peril-
leuse, both of which arc written in French and were pub-
lished at Paris, the 1irst-named in 1561 and the second
eleven years later. His claims to tile authorship of tile
latter work have frequently been cisputed, but the former
is almost certainly his, and a curious production it is. At
the outset the author professes himself an adept in hermetic
philosoyhy, and thereafter he proceeos, in poetry of an
allegoncal style which recalls The Romaunt of the Rose, to
describe the different processes to be gone through ere
achieving a transmutation. There is little in this metrical
treatise which indicates that the writer was an alchemist
of any great ability, but he certainly possessed a distinct
gift for making pleasant ii hardly powerful verses.

Fortune-telling : Fortun~-telling i~ Britain. v.'as formerly
included under the cr1me of Witchcraft, and was made
punishable by death under the Statute of 1563.C. 73· ';l'his
Act was repealed by 9 George II. C. 5, which ordained
that no prosecution should thereafter be made on charge
of Witchcraft, also bv the said Act all persons professing
to occult skill or undertaking to tell fortunes Inight be sen-
tenced to imprisonment tor one year, and to stand pillory
and find surety for their future good behaviour.
Punishment by pillory is now abolisheJ. By Act 5
George IV. c. 83 fortune-tellers were included along with
other vagrants under the general category of rogues and
vagabonds, and were liable to imprisonment for three
months. This Act was made applicable to Scotland
by 34 and 35 Viet. C. 24. . . .
No prosecution occurred under 1t until the case of Sm1th
(23 R (I.C.) 77). The oH Act extended to ~tland as afo.re-
said enacted that " every person pretendmg or professmg
to tell fortunes or using any subtle craft, means, or device,
by palmistry or otherwise to deceive, and impose on any
of His Majesty's Subjects " shall be C:eemed a vagabond
and rogue within the meaning of the Act and shall b6 plm·
ishable as therein provided. In the case above referred
to the complainer, a woman named Jonc Lee or Sinith,
was charged in the Police Court at Glasgow. with a contra-
vention of the above enactment in respect that at a time
and place specified, did ~;>retencl to tell the fortunes of " a
person named " who was thereby induced to pay the ac-
cused the sum of sixpence. The accused was convicted
of the contravention •· as libelled" and brought a suspen-
sion. The Court quashed the conviction, holding that
the complaint was irrelevant in that it did not set forth
that the accused had pretended to tell fortunes with intent
to deceive an:i impose on any one. Lord Young, one of
the judges, in the course of his opinion says " It has never
been imagined, so far as I have ever heard, or thought,
that writing. publishing, or selling books on the lines of
the hand, or even on astrology-the position of the stars
at birth and the rules upon which astrologers proceed in
telling fortunes therefrom. I say that I have never heard
of publishing, or selling such books is an offence, or that
reading such books, and telling fortunes therefrom is an
offence. Roguery and knavery might be cominitted that
way, but it would be a SP.Ccial cc::sc. I am not in any way
suggesting that a spae wtfc o( anyone else may not through
that means commit knavery and deception, and so be
liable to punishment."
It would thus appear that fortune-telling is of itself no
offence, unless it is accompanied by fraud, impositions,
or intent to deceive. While it might be an offence for the
palmist or fortune-teller knowingly to accept payment
from a half witted or obviously apparent ignorant person,
it can hardly be pretended that the ordinary person who
consults a professional fortune teller or chrystal gazer and
tenders payment in return for their skill at delineations
of character or forecasting of the future, feels that he bas
been imposed upon should the delineations be at fault, or
the forecast turn out inaccurate. A.J.13.G.
Fo untain Spirits of Behmen : According to Jacob Behmen,
there were in nature seven active principles, the " Fountain
Spirits, or "Mothers of Existence." These were-the
astringent quality ; the sweet quality ; the bitter quality ;
the quality of fire; the quality of Jove; the quality of
sound ; and the quality of essential substance. The re-
ciprocal action of these antipathetic qualities resulted in
Supreme Unity. Each is at once the parent and the child
of all the rest, for they generate and are generated by each
other. They are typified by the seven golden candlesticks
of the Apocalypse.
Fourth Dimension of Space : There are three known dimen~
sions in space typified in the three geometric figures--a
line, having length, a surface, length and breadth, a cube,
length, breadth and thickness. It has been conjectured
that a fourth dimensi<nr may exist in addition to length,
breadth, and thickness. Spiritualists have claimed to
find proof of a fourth dimension in certain of the physical
phenomena of the stance-room such as the tying of knots
1n endless cords, and the passage of matter through matter.

Fox, Sisters : Two American girls who in 1847 practically
commenced the practice of spirit-rapping in Arcadia. New

Fragaraeh (The Answerer) : In Irish legend a sword that

France : lllagical practice in pre-Roman Fra11ce was vested
in the druidic cast, and was practically identical with that
of the same body in Britain, from which, indeed, it drew
its inspiration. It is not likely that Roman magic gained
any footing in Gaul, but we have little evidence to show
whether this was or was not the case. In the early
Frankish period of the Merovingian dynasty, we find the
baleful personality of Fredcgonda, wife of Hilperic, king
of Soissons, " a woman whose glance was witchcraft."
She destroyed many people on the pretext of sorcery, but
there is no doubt that she herself experimented in black
magic, and protected many practitioners of the art. Thus
she saved a sorceress who had been arrested by Ageric,
bishop of Verdun, by hiding her in the palace. (See Frede-
gonda.) The practice of magic was not punished under
the rule of the early French kings, except in those in high
places, with whom it was regarded as a political offence,
as in the case of the military leader Mummol, who was
tortured by command of Hilperic for sorcery. One of
the Salic laws attributed to Pharamond by Sigebcrt states
that; " If any one shall testify that another has acted
as hereburge or strioport-titles applied to those who carry
the copper vessel to the spot where the vampires perforrn
their enchantments-and if be fail to convict him, he shall
be condemned hereby to a forfeit of 7,500 de11iers, being
xSo+ sous. . . . If a vampire shall devour a man and
be found guilty, she shall forfeit 8,ooo deniers, being 200
sous."
The Church legislated also against sorcerers and vam-
pires, and the Council of Agde, in Languedoc, held in A.D.
506. pronounced excommunication against them. The
first Council of Orleans, convened in 541, condemned divi-
nation and au~ury, and that of Narbonne, in 589, besides
excommunicating all sorcerers, ordained that they should
be sold as slaves for the benefit of the poor. Those who
had dealings with the Devil were also condemned to be
whipped by the same Council. Some extraordinary
phenomena are alleged to have occurred in France during
the reign of Pepin Ic Brcf. The air seemed to be alive with
human shapes, mirages filled the heavens, and sorcerers
were seen among the clouds, scattering unwholesome po\V·
dcrs and poisons with open hands ; crops failed, cattle
died, and many human beings perished. It is perhaps
possible that such visions were stimulated by the teachings
of the famous Kabalist, Zedekias, who presided over a
school of occult science, where he refrained indeed from
unveiling the hidden secrets of his art, and contented him-
self by spreading the theory of elemental spirits, who, he
stated, had before the fall of man been subservient to him.
France 165
It was thought that the visions alluded to above signified
the descent of sylphs and salamanders tn search of their
former masters. Says Eliphas Levi :
" Voyages to the land of sylphs were talked of on all
sides as we talk at the present day of animated tables and
fiuidic manifestatioru;. The folly took possession even
of strong minds, and it was time for an intervention on
the part of the Church, which does not relish the super-
natural being hawked in the public streets, seeing that
such disclosures, by imperilling the respect due to au-
thority and to the hierarchic chain of instruction, cannot
be attributed to the spirit of order and light. The cloud-
phantoms were therefore arraigned and accused of being
hell-born illusions, while the people--anxious to get
something into their hands--began a crusade against
sorcerers. The public folly turned into a paroxysm of
mania : strangers in country places were accuzed of
descending from heaven and were killed without mercy;
imbeciles confessed that they had been abducted by sylphs
or demons ; others who bad boasted like this previously
either would not or could not unsay it : they were burned
or drowned, and, according to Garinet, the number who
perished throughout the kingdom almost exceeds belief.
It is the common catastrophe of dramas in which the first
parts are played by ignorance or fear.
•· Such visionary epidemics recurred in the reigns fol-
lowing, and all the power of Charlemagne was put in action
to calm the public agitation. An edict, afterwards re-
newed by Lou1s the Pious, forbade sylphs to manifest under
the heaviest penalties. It will be understood that in the
absence of the aerial beings the judgments fell upon those
who had made a boast of having seen them, and hence
they ceased to be seen. The ships in air sailed back to
the port of oblivion, and no one claimed any longer to have
journeyed through the blue distance. Other popular
frenzies replaced the previous mania, while the romantic
splendours of the great reign of Charlemagne furnished
the makers of l11gends with new prodigies to believe and
new marvels to relate."
Around the figure of Charlemagne (q.v.) clusters such
an immense amount of the matter of faery that it is re-
served for treatment in a special article, and it v.ill suffice
to state here that it almost partakes of the nature of true
myth. I~ is st:"ted that the E11chiridiou (q.v.) (which may
well be stigmatised as an early text-book of occult absurdity
having no claim to figure in the true genealogy of occult
literature) was presented to Charlemagne by Pope
Leo III.
. Eliph
,as Levi presents a pi~uresque condition of affairs
m the Franca of Charlemagne 10 the follov.oing passage :
" We kn~~ that superstiti~ns die bard and that degen-
erated DrU1d1sm had struck 1ts roots deeply in the savage
lands of the North. The recurring insurrections of Saxons
testified to a fanaticism which was (a) always turbulent,
and (b) incapable of repression by moral force alone. All
~efeated for"!"s of worship-~oman pagan~srn,. Germa~ic
1dolatry, Jew1sh rancour consp1red aga1nst v1ctonous Chns-
tianity. Nocturnal assemblies took place; thereat the
consp1rators cemented their alliance with the blood of
hi!-rnan victims : and a pantheistic idol of monstrous form,
Wlth the horns of a goat, presided over festivals which
might be called agapl% of hatred. In a word the Sabbath
was still celebrated in every forest and wild if yet unre-
claimed provinces. The ad~pts who attended them were
m~ked. and ot~erwise unrecognisable; the assemblies
cxting1!'1Shed thetr lights and broke up before daybreak,
the gu1lty were to be found everywhere, and they could
be brought to book nowhere. It came about therefore
that Charlemagne determined to fight them with their own
weapons.
France
" In those days, moreover, feudal tyrants were in league
with sectarians against lawful authonty ; female sorcerers
were attached to castles as courtesans; bandits who fre-
quented the Sabbaths divided with nobles the blood-stained
loot of rapine ; feudal courts were at the command of the
highest bidder ; and the public burdens weighed with all
their force only on the weak and poor. The evil ·was at its
height in Westphalia, and faithful ag~nts were desJ>a:tc.hed
thither by Charlemagne entrusted with a secret ID.lSSlOD.
Whatsoever energy remained among the oppressed, who-
soever still loved justice, whether among the people or
among the nobility, were drawn by these emissaries to-
gether, bound by pledges and vigilance in common. To
tpe initiates thus incot'J.'Orated they made known the full
powers which they earned from the emperor himself, and
they proceeded to institute the Tribunal of Free Judges.
A great deal of this, of -course, is only what might be
expected from the French magus. It is not likely that the
Sabbath was yet celebrated in such an ,extreme manner
as in later times, nor was the Vehmgencht founded by
Charlemagne, or indeed, founded at all, for four and a half
centuries after his day.
From the reign of Robert the Pious t? that ~f St.. Lo~is,
there is not much to relate that can stnke the 1magmatlon
of the student of occult history. In the time of the latter
monarch flourished the famou~ Rabbi Jachiel, the cele-
brated Kabalist. There is some reason to believe that
he had glimrnerings of the uses of electrici~y. ~or on .the
approach of night a radiant star appeared 10 hiS lodg1ng,
the light being so brilliant that no eye could gaze thereon
without being dazzled, while it darted rainbow colours.
It appeared to be inexhaustible, and was never replenishe~
with oil or other combustible substance. When the Rabb1
was annoyed by intruders at his door he struck a nail fixed
in his cabinet, producing simultaneously a blue spa:rk o~
the head of the nail and the door-knocker, to which, lf
the intruder clung, be received a severe shock. AJbertus
Magnus (q.v.) lived ilt the s2.me period.
The next tircurnstance of interest which falls to be noted
is the prosecutions of the Templars (q.v.) who were brought
to trial by Philip the Fair. Other prosecutions for sorcery
were those of Joan of Arc, Gilles de Laval (q.v.). lord of
Raiz, the prototype of Bluebc<i!d• a r.enowned .sorcer~r,
who with two ass1stants, Prelati and S1llc, practised dia-
bolical rites at his castle of Machecoul, celebrating the
black mass in the roost revolting manner. He had been
in the habit of slaughtering children to assist him in .his
search for the philosopher's stone. 'Ne now ncar the penod
of those astounding prosecutions for sorcery which are
fully noted under the article '' Witchcraft " and elsewhere.
As early as the thirteenth century the charge of sorcery
had been made as one of the means of branding with in-
famy the heretical Waldenses. (q.v.), who :were accu;;ed
of selling themselves to the DeVIl, and of holding sabbat;ical
orgies where they did homage to the enemy of mankind.
About the middle of the fifteenth century Frat~ce became
the theatre of wholesale oppression against suspected sor-
cerers, but one finds leading up to this a series of events
which prove that the outburst in question was by no means
a novelty in that country. In 13'5 Enguerraud de
Marigny. who had conducted the execution of the Tex;nplars
a minister of Philip the Fair, was hanged along With an
adventurer named Paviot, for attempting to compass the
deaths of the Counts of Valois and St. Paul. In 1334 the
Countess of Artois and her sou were thrown into prison
on a suspicion of sorcery. In 1393, in the reign of Charles
VI., it was considered that his sister-in-law, the Duchess
of Orleans. who was a viscomte and the daughter of the
Duke of Milan, had rendered the King mad by sorcery.
The ministers of the court resolved to pit a magician against

her, and one Arn&ud Guillaume (q.v.) was brought from
Guienne as a suitable adversary to the noble lady. He
possessed a book to which he gave the strange title of
Smagcwad, the original of which, he said, was given by God
to Adam, to console him for the lpss of his son Abel, and
be asserted that the possessor of this volume could hold
the stars in subjection, and command the four elements.
He assured the King's advisers that Charles was suffering
from the malignity of a sorcerer, but in the meantime the
young monarch recovered, and the possessor of the patri-
archal volume fell back into his original obscurity. Five
years later the King had another attack, and two Augus-
tine friars were sent from Guienne for the purpose of effect-
ing a cure. But their conduct was so outrageous that
they were executed. A third attack in 1403 was combated
by two sorcerers of Dijon, Poinson and Briquet. For this
purpose they established themselves in a thick wood not
far from the gates of Dijon, where they made a magic circle
of iron of immense we1ght, which was supported by iron
columns of the height of a middle-sized man, and to which
twelve chains of iron were attached. So great was the
popular anxiety for the IGng's recovery, that the two
sorcerers succeeded in persuading twelve of the principal
persons of the town to enter the circle, and allow them-
selves to be fastened by the chains. The sorcerers then
proceeded with their incantations, but they were altogether
without result. The bailiff of Dijon, who was one of'the
twelve, and had averred his incredulity from the first,
caused the sorcerers to be arrested, and they were burnt
for their pretences.
The Duke of Orleans appears to have fallen under the
same suspicion of sorcery as his Italian consort. After
his murder by order of the Duke of Burgundy-the com-
mencement of those troubles which led to the desolation
of France-the latter drew up various heads of accusation
against his victim as justifications of the c1ime, and one
of these was, that the Duke of Orleans had attempted to
compass his death by means of sorcery. According to
this statement, he had received a magician-another apos-
tate friar- into his castle of ~Iountjoie, where he was
employed in these sinister designs. He performed his
magical ceremonies before sunrise on a neighbouring
mountain, where two demons, named Herman and Astra-
moo, appeared to him; and these became his active in-
struments in the prosecution of his design.
About the year 1400 the belief in the nightly meetings
of the ·witches' Sabbath had become almost universal. It
would indeed be difficult to attempt to trace the origin
of this practice, which does not seem altogether referable
to the survival of pagan belief. (See Witchcraft.) The
wholesale nature of the prosecutions agaim.~ sorcerers and
witches prove that there must have been an extraordinary
number of them in the country. In Paris alone, in the
time of Charles IX. there were no less than thirty thousand
sorcerers, and it is computed that France contained more
than three times that number in the reign of Henry I II.,
not a town or village being exempt from their presence.
They belonged to all classes, and generally met the same
fate, regardless of rank, age or sex. Children of the ten-
derest years and nonagenarians were alike committed to
the flames, and the terror of being publicly accused as a
sorcerer hung like a black cloud over the life of every
successful man, as the charge w?.s one which envy readily
seized upon for the destruction of its object. No elaborate
or perfect creed regarding witchcraft had at this epoch
been cvoh·ed in England, but in Frauce and other conti-
nental countries it had been assuming a form systematic
and complete. There were probably two reasons for this,
the decrees of ecclesiastical councils and the numerous
treatises of scholars who professed to illustrate their various
theories regarding sorcery by alleged statements from the
mouths of its innumerable victims. Indeed the writings
of these men served to standardise the sorcery creed of all
continental countries. During the earlier part of the six-
teenth century, trials for witchcraft in France are of rare
occurrence, and there are no cases of great importance
recorded till after the year 1560. In 1561 a number of
persons were brought to trial at Vernon, accused of having
held their Sabbath as witches in an old ruined castle in
the shape of cats ; and witnesses deposed to having seen
the asselllbly, and to having suffered from the attacks of
the pseudo-feline conspirators. But the court threw out
the charge, as worthy only of ridicule. In 1564. three men
and a woman were executed at Poitiers, after having been
made to confess to various acts of sorcery; among other
things, they said that they had regularly attended the
witches' Sabbath, which was held three times a year, and
that the demon who presided at it enued by burning him-
self to make powder for the use of his agents in mischief.
In 1571, a mere conjurer, who played tricks upon cards,
was thrown into prison in Paris, forced to confess that be
was an attendant on the Sabbath, and then executed. In
1573, a man was burnt at Drolc, on the charge of having
changed himself into a wolf, and in that form devoured
several children. Several ·witches, who all confessed to
having been at the Sabbaths, were in the same year con·
demned to be burnt in different parts of France. In 1578,
another man was tried and condemned in Paris for changing
himself into a wolf ; and a man was condemned at Orleans
for the same supposed crime.in 1583. As France was'often
infested by these rapacious ar.imals, it is not difficult to
conceive how popular credulity was led to connect their
ravages with the crime of witchcraft. The belief in what
were in England called wer-wolves (men-wolves), and in
France loups-garous, was a very ancient superstition
throughout Ecrope. It is asserted by a serious and in-
telligent writer of the time that, in 1588, a gentleman,
looking out of the window of his chateau in a village two
leagues from Apchon, in the mountains of Auvergne, saw
one of his acquaintances going a-bunting, and begged he
would bring him home some game. The hunter, while
occupied in the chase, was attacked by a fierce she-wolf, and
after having fired at it without effect, strucJ.:: it with his
hunting-knife, al'd cut off the paw O( his ri~l:t fore-leg, on
which it immediately took to flight. The hunter took up
the paw, threw it into his bag with the rest of his game,
and soon afterwards returned to his friend's chateau, and
told him of his adventure, at the same time putting his
hand into the bag to bring forth the wolf's paw in confirma-
tion of his story. What was his surprise at drawing out
a lady's hand, ~;th a gold ring on one finger ! His friend's
astonishment was still greater when he recognised the ring
as one which he had given to his own wife ; and, descending
hastily into the kitchen, he found the lady warming herself
by the fire, with her right arm wrapped in her apron. This
he at once seized, and found to his horror that the hanu
was cut off. The lady confessed that it was she who, in
the form of a wolf, had attackeu the hunter; she was. in
due -course of time, brought to her trial and condemned,
and was immediately a.fterwards burnt at ruonlS.
In 1578, a witch was burnt at Compi~gne; she confessed
that she had given herself to the devil, who appeared to
her as a great black man. on horseback, booted and spurred.
Another avowed witch was burnt the same year, who also
stated that the evil one came to her in the shape of a black
man. In 1582 and 1583, several witches were burnt, all
frequenters of the Sabbaths. Several local councils at
this date passed severe laws against witchcraft, and from
that time to the end of the century, the number of miser-
able persons put to death in Frauce under the accusation
Frc..nt:e 167
was very great. In the course only of fifteen years, from
158o to 1595, and only in one province, that of Lorraine,
the president Rentigius bumt nine hundred witches, and
as many more fled out of the country to save their lives ;
and about the close of the century, one of the French judges
tells us that the crime of witchcraft bad become so common
that there were not jails enough to bold the prisoners, or
judges to hear their causes. A trial which he had wit-
nessed in 1568, induced Jean Bodin, a learned physician,
to compose his book De la Demcmomauie des Sorciers, which
was ever afterwards the text-book on this subject.
Among the English witches, lhe evil one generally came
in person to seduce his victims. but in France and other
countries, this seems to have been unnecessary, as each
person, when once initiated, became seized with an uncon-
trollable desire of making converts, whom he or she carried
to the Sabbath to be duly eurollcd. Bodin says, that one
'ritch was enough to cOTTupt five hundred honest persons.
The infection quickly ran through a family, and was gen-
erally carried down from generation to generation, which
explained satisfactorily, according to the learned commen-
tator on demonology just mentioned, the extent to which
the evil had spread itself in his days. The novice, at his
or her reception, after having performed the preliminaries,
and in general received a new and burlesque rite of baptism,
was marked with the sign of the demon in some part of
the body least exposed to observation, and performed the
first criminal act of compliance which was afterwards to
be so frequently repe:!.ted, the evil one presenting himself
on these occasions in the form of either sex, the reverse
to that of the victim.
Towards the end of the sixteenth century, the witchcraft
infatuation had risen to its greatest height in Fra11ce, and
not only the lower classes, but persons of the highest rank
in society were liable to suspicions of dealing in sorcery.
We need only menlion that such charges were publicly
made against IGng Henry Ill. and Queen Catherine de
hledicis, and that, early in the following century, they
became the ground of state trials which had a fatal con-
clusion.
In 16ro, during the reign of Louis XIII., occurred the
.;ause ciUbre of the marechale d' Ancre. Among the ser-
vants attached to the tr~:.in of Marie de l\Iedici was a certain
Eleanora Dori, who married one, Concini, a prodigal spend-
thrift. Marie de Medici, as guardian to her son, was
virtually ruler of France, and considerable power was
exercised by these favourites of hers. The result was that
the peers of France leagued themselves together against
the upstarts, but with litlle result at first, as Concini was
created 1\larechal of Prance, with the title of Marquis
d'Ancre. His wife, who was very superstitious, fell sick,
and attributed her ill-health to tho effects of sorcery. The
upshot was that d'Ancre was assassinated by the nobles
during a hunting expedition. The mob dragged the corpse
of d'Ancre from its grave and hanged it oJl the Pont Neuf.
His wretched widow was accused of sorcery, and of having
bewitched the Queen Mother. The exorcists who had
assisted her to free herself from illness had advised the
sacrifice of a cock, and this was now represented as a sacri-
fice to the infernal powers. Added to this, the astrological
nativities of the royal family were found in her possession,
as were, it is said, a quantity of magical books, and a great
number of magical characters. After being tortured ,vith-
out result she was bel}eaded and burnt, and strangely
enough the anger of the Parisian mob turned to general
commiseration. :1-Iany other interesting cases occurred
in France in the seventeenth century, among others that
o.f-the Ursulines at Aix (q.v.), for the enchantment of whom
Louis Gaufridi was burnt, the Xuns of Louviais, and the
nuns of Assonne. The case of the Ursulines of Loudon
France
(q.v.), is fully deait with elsewhere. (See Urban Grandier).
The eighteenth century in Fran« was fairly prolific in
occult history. At a time when Europe was credulous
about nothing but magic, Frat~ce did not escape the pre-
vailing craze. Perhaps the most striking personality of
this age in the occult connection was tbe Comte de Saint
Germain (q.v.), who was credited with possessing the secrets
of alchemy and magic. His family connections were un-
known, and his conversation suggested that he had lived
for many centuries. Another mysterious adept was an
alchemist calling himself Lascaris (q.v.) who literally sowed
his path through Europe with gold. Then followed Cag-
liostro (q.v.), who attained a fame unrivalled in the history
of French occultism. He founded many masonic lodges
throughout the country, and assisted in many ways to
bring about lhe French Revolution. A school of initiates
was founded by Martines de Pasqually, which appears in
some measure to have incorporated the teachings of the
later European adepts. One of the most important figures
at this time is Louis Claude de Saint-lVIartin, known as
" Le Philosophe Inconnu " who came under the influence
of Pasqually (q.v.), and later, under that of the writings
of Boehme, whose works he translated. Cazotte (q.v.)
was the first of these names who were associated with both
ma~ic and the Revolution, which, indeed, owed much in
its mception to those mysterious brotherhoods of France
and Germany, wh!> during the ei~hteenth century sowed
the seeds of equality and Jllumimsm throughout Europe.
Another was Loiseaut (q.v.), who formed a mystical society,
which met in great secrecy, awaiting a vision of john the
Baptist, who came to them to foretell t~ Revolution.
The spiritual director of this circle was a monk named
Dom Gerle (q.v.) one of the first mesmerists in Paris, who
is said to have foretold the dreadful fame of Robespierre
by means of Catherine Thcot, his medium. He was ex-
pelled by the members of the circle, acting on the advice
of one of their number, Sister Fran~oise Andre, who cher-
ished a notion to preserve the crown for the future reign
of Louis XVII., and thus gave rise to that multitude of
storiesconnected with theso-called "5aviours" of the youth-
ful'' Capet." This sect,or a portionof it, became notorious
under the leadership of Vintras (q.v.), when its meetings
degenerated into the most dreadful debauchery. The
appearance of ?.'Die. Lenormand as a prophetess at the
end of the eighteenth century may be said to close the
oecuJt history of that age. With the beginning of the
nineteenth century we find the craze for magnetism ram-
pant. In his works The Reform of Plnlosoplay and Yes
or No, 'Wronski pretended to have discovered the first
theorems of the Kabala, and later beguiled rich persons
of weak intellect into paying him large sums in return for
knowledge of the Absolute. The Saviours of Louis XVII.
were formally condemned in J853 by the Pope as prac-
titioners of black magic, but they in turn condemned the
Pope, and thcir leader, Vinlras, constituted himself
Sovereign Pontiff, but he was arrested on the charge of
roguery and after :live years' imprisonment, found an asy-
lum in England.
The Baron du Potet <lid much to advance the science
of :Mesmer and by this time was being seriously followed
by Cahagnet and others (See Mesmerism}. In the middle
of the nineteenth century all sorts of absurdities swayed
occult Paris. The tale of Alphonse Esquiros (q.v.) entitled
The Magicialf founded a school of magic phantasy, which
was assiduously nursed by Henri Pelaage (q.v.), who was
said to have the gift of ubiquity, and who made a collection
of processes from the old magicians for acquiring physical
beauty.
Spiritualism. The Comte d'Ourehes was the first to
introduce into F~a11ce autoo1atic writing and table-writing_
France 168
Baron Guldenstubbe, in his Practical Experimental Pnea-
matology; or, the Reality of Spirits and the Martlellous
Phmomena of their Direct Writing, gives an account of his
discovery as follows :
"It was in the course of the year r8so, or about three
years prior to the epidemic of table-rapping, that the author
sought to introduce into Fra>1ce the circles of American
spiritualism. the mysterious Rochester knockings and the
purely a~tomatic writings of .mediums. Unfortunately
be met w1th many obstacles ra1sed by other mesmerists.
Those who were committed to the hypothesis ot a magnetic
fluid, and even those who styled themselves Spiritual Mes-
merists, but who were really inferior inducers of somnam-
bulism, treated the mysterious knockings of American
spiritualism as visionary follies. It was therefore only
after more than six months that the author was able to
form his first circle on the American plan, and then thanks
to the r.ealous concurrence of M. Rousaan, a former mem-
ber of the Soci~te des M ag11etiseurs SpiritttaHstes, a simple
man who \Vas full of enthusiasm for the holy cause ofspirit-
ualism. We were joined by a number of other persons,
amongst whom was the Abbe Chatel, founder of the .Eglise
Fran\aise, who, despite his rationalistic tendencies, ended
by admitting the reality of objective and supernatural
revelation, as an indispensable coAdition of spiritualism and
all practical religions. Setting aside the moral conditions
which are equally requisite, it is known that American
circles a1e based on the distinction of positive and electric
or negative magnetic currents.
" The circles consist of twelve persons, representing in
equal proportions the positive and negative or sensitive
elements. This distinction does not follow the sex of the
members, though generally women are negative and sensi-
tive, while men are positive and magnetic. The mental
and physical constitution of each individual must bestudied
before forming the circles, for some delicate women have
masculine qualities, while some strong men are, morally
speaking. ''~'omen. A table is placed in a clear and ven-
tilated spot; the medium is seated at one end and entirely
isolated; by his calm and contemplative quietude he serves
as a CO}lductor for the electricity, and it ma'y be noted that
a good somnambulist is usually an excellent medium. The
six electrical or negative dispositions, which are generally
recognised by thei:r emotional qualiti~ and their sensibility,
are placed at the right of the medium. the most sensitive
of all being next him. The same rule is followed with the
positive personalities, who are at the left of the medium,
with the most positive next to him. In order to form a
chain, the twelve persons each place their right hand on
the table. Observe that the medium or mediums, if there
be more than one, are entirely isolated from those who
form the chain.
"After a number of seances, certain remarkable phen-
omena have been obtained, such as simultaneous shocks,
felt by all present at the moment of mental evocation on
the part of the most intelligent persons. It is the same
with mysterious knockings and other strange sounds ;
many people, including those least sensitive, have had
simultaneous visions, though remaining in the ordinary
waking state. Sensitive persons have acquired that most
wonderful gift of mediumship, namely, automatic writing,
as the result of an invisible attraction which uses the non-
intelligent instrument of a human arm to express its ideas.
For the rest, non-sensitive persons experience the mys-
terious influence of an external wind, but the effect is not
strong enough to put their limbs in motion. All these
phenomena, obtained according to the mode of American
spiritualism, have the defect of being more or less indirect,
because it is impo5sible in these experiments to dispense
with the mediat:on of a human being or medium. It is
France
the s~me with the table-turning which invaded Europe in
the middle of the year r853·
"The author has had many table experiences with his
honourable friend, the Comte d'Ourches, one of the most
instructed persons in Magic and the Occult Sciences. We
attained by degrees the point when tables moved, apart
from any co:thct whatever, while the Comte d'Omches
has caused them to rise. also without contact. The author
has made tables rush across a room with g1eat rapidity,
and not only without contact but without the magnetic
aid of a circle of sitters. The vibrations of piano-chords
~nder similar circumstances took placeon january zo, 1856.
lll the presence of the Comte de Szapary and Comte
d'Ourches. Now all such phenomena are proof positive
of certain occult forces, but they do not demonstrate ade-
quately the real and substantial existence of unseen intel·
ligences, independent of our will and imagination, though
the limits of these have been vastly extended in respect of
their possibilities. Hence the reproach made against
American spiritualists, because their communications with
the world of spirits are so insignificant in character, being
confined to mysterious knockings and other sound vibra-
tions. As a fact, there is no direct phenomenon at once
intelligent and m:J.terial, independent of our will and im-
agination, to compare with the direct writing of spirits,
who have neither been invoked or evoked, and it is this
only which offers irrefutable proof as to the reality of the
supernatural world.
'' The author, being always in search of such proof, at
once intelligent and palpable, concerning the substantial
reality of the supernatmal world, in order to demonstrate
by certain facts the immortality of the soul, has never
wearied of addressing fervent prayers to the Eternal, that
He might vouchsafe to indicate an infallible means for
strengthening th;~.t f;~ith in immortality which is the eternal
basis of religion. The Eterna,l, Whose mercy is infinite,
has abundantly answered this feeble prayer. On August
rst, 1856, the idea Ca.me to the author of trying whether
spirits could write di1ectly, that is, apart from the presence
of a medium. Remembering the marvellous direct \vriting
of the Dec;~logue, communicated to Moses, and that other
writing, equnlly direct and mysterious, at the feast of
Belshazzar, recorded by Daniel: having further heard
about those modern mysteries of Stratford in America,
where certain strange and illegible characters were found
upon strips of paper, apparently apart from mediumship,
the author sought to establish the actuality of such im-
portant phenomena, if indeed within the limits of possi-
bilitv.
" He therefore placed a sheet of blank letter paper and
a sharplv pointed pencil in a box, which he then locked,
and carried the key about him, imparting his design t()
no one. Twelve days he waited in vain, but what was his
astonishment on August 13th, 1856, when he found certain
mysterious characters traced on the paper. He repeated
the experiment ten times on that day, placing a new sheet
of paper each time in the box, with the same result invari-
ably. On the following day he made twenty experiments
but left the box open, without losing sight of it- He wit-
nessed the formation of characters and words in the Es-
thonian language with no motion of the pencil. The latter
being obviously useless he decided to dispense with it and
placed blank paper sometimes on a table of his own, some-
times on the pedestals of old statues, on sarcophagi, on
urns. etc., in the Louvre, at St. Denis, at the Church of
St. Etienne du l\font, etc., Similar experiments were mad~t
in different cemetries of Paris, but the author has no liking
for cemetries, while most saints prefer the localities where
they have lived on earth to those in which their mortal
remains are laid to rest."
France 169
·we are now launched upon the sea of modern spiritualism
in Fra11c;e, which occupied the entire activities of occultists
in that country for several decades, and which it will be
better to trace from the period of its importation into the
country.
Very soon after public attention had been drawn to the
subject of m'lgnetism in Praucc by Mesmer and d'Eslon,
several men distinguished for learning and scientific at-
tainments, followed un their experiments with great success.
Amongst these was the Baron Dupotet, whose deep interest
in the subject of mal(netism induced him to publish a peri-
odical which, under the title of ]ounral de i\fagnetisme-
still forms a complete treasury of well collated facts, and
curious experiments in occult force. From this work we
learn that the Baron's investigations commenced in the
year 1836, since which oeriod up to 1848, he chronicled
the production of the following remarkable phases of phen-
omena, the occurrence of which is testified to by numerous
scientific and eminent witnesses. Through the Baron's
magnetized subjects was evolved, clairvoyance, trance-
spea'king, and healing : stigmata or raised letters and figures
on the subject's body; elevation of somnambulists into
the air; insensibility to fire, injury or touch. In the
presence of the magnetized objects also, heavy bodies.were
moved without human contact, and objects were brought
from distant places through walls and closed doors. Some-
times the " Lucides" descl"ibed set~nes in the spirit world,
found lost property, prophesied and spoke in foreign
languages.
In 1840, Baron Dupotet writes that he had" rediscovered
in magnetism the magic of antiquity." " Let the savants,"
he says, " reject the doctrine of spiritual appearances :
the enquirer of to·day is compelled to believe it; from an
examination of undeniable facts." . . . " If the know-
ledge of ancient magic is lost, all the facts remain on which
to reconstruct it.''
But of all the revealer!> to whom French Spiritualism
is indebted for indubitable proof of super-mundane inter-
course, none stands more prominent in truthfulness and
worth, than M. Cah1.gnet, the well-known author of " The
Celestial Telegraph," a work translated into English in
1848.
M. Cahagnet was an unlearned mechanic, a man of the
people and though a sensible and intere;;ting writer, was
neither well read, nor highly educated. He affirms that
he was a " materialist" when first his attention was at-
tracted to the subject of animal magnetism, but being of
a thoughtful nature, he determined to devote all the leisure
he could spare to a thorough examination of its possibilities.
When he found that he possessed the power to induce the
magnetic sleep in others, he proceeded on the plan then
generally adopted by mesmerists, nam-ely, to try how far
be could, succee~ in biologizing his subjects, that is to say,
to substitute lus own senses, mind, and will, for those of
the sleeper.
In the course of these experiments :M. Cahagnet dis-
covered that he could effect remarkable cures oi disease
a~d being natnrally of a benevolent disposition, he deter:
mmed to bend all his energies in this desirable direction.
He soon found, however, that he was destined to realize
the aphorism, ·• he builded wiser than be knew." A new
and most perplexing obstacle arose to confound hi~ phil-
osophy and scatter his theories to t;he winds; this was the
f?-ct, that sof!le of his subj~ts,_
inste?-d of representing what
Slrnply he w!lleci, or rn1.mfesbng-ln accordance with his
views of biology-m~rely the_
inliuence of his mind, began
to trar:tsccnd both w~ll an~ IUllld, and wander off in space,
to regtons t~cy pers&sted m calling the " land of spirits,"
and to descnbe people, whom they emphaticaUy affirmed
to be the souls of those whom the world called dead.
France
For a long time M. Cahagnet strove vehemently to c0m·
bat what he termed these •· wild hallucin:ltions," but when
he found them constantly rccurrinp:, and vast numbers of
those who had come to witness the experiments in mag-
netism recognising in the descriptions given by the somnam·
bulists the spirits of those whom they had known on earth,
and mourned as dead, conviction became inevitable, and
the magnetizer, like his visitors, was compelled to admit
a new and wonderful phase of lucidity, and one which
carried the vision of the clairvoyant from earth to heaven,
and pierced the veil which separated the mortal fro:n the
realms of immortality. It was after a long series of care-
fully conducted experiments of the above description, that
1\f. Cahagnet was finally persuaded to give the results of
his wonderful s6anccs to the world, under the name and
style of The Celestial Telegraph, or, Secrets of the Life to
Come.
The author of Art 111agic says: "The narrow conser·
vatism of the age, and the pitiful jealousy of the Medical
F3culty, rendered it difficult and harc:.ssing to conduct
magnetic experiments openly in Europe within several
years of Mesmer's decease. Still such experiments were
not wanting, and to show ~heir results, we give a few
excerpts from the correspondence between the famous
French Magnetists, M~i. Deleuze and Billot, from the years
1829 to r84o. By these letters, published in 1836, it ap-
pears that i.\L Billot commenced his experiments in mag-
netizing as early as 1789, and that during forty years, he
had an opportunity of witnessing facts in clairvoyance,
ecstasy, and somnambulism, which at the time of their
publication transcended the bt:lief of the gener;~.l mass of
readers. On many occasions in the presence of entranced
subjects, spirits recognised as having once lived on earth
in mortal form-would come in bodily presence before the
eyes of an assembled multitude and at request bring flowers,
fruits, and objects, removed by distance from the scene
of the experiments.
" M. Deleuze franklyadmits that his experience was more
limited to those phases of somnambulism in which his
subjects submitted to amputations and severe surgical
operations without experiencing the slightest pain....
In a letter dated 183r ~I. Billot writing to Delenze
says:- .
·• • I repea.t, 1 have seen and known all that is permitted
to man. I have seen the stigmata arise on magnetized
subjects ; I have dispelled obsessions of evil spirits with
a single word. I have seen spirits bring those material
objects I told you of, and when requested, make them so
light that they would float, and, again, a small boitea:.~. de
bonbons was rendered so heavy that I failed to move it an
inch until the power was removed.
·• ' To those who enjoyed the unspeakable privilege of
listening to the " somnambulcs" of Billot, Dcleuze, and
Cahagnet, another and yet 11\0re striking feature ol unani-
JUO;JS revelation was poured forth. Spirits of those who-
had passed away from earth strong in the faith of Romau
Catholicism-often priests and dignitaries of that conser-
vative Church, addressing prejudiced believers in their
former dochine, asserted that there was no creed in Heaven
-no sectarian worship, or ecclesiastical dogmatism there
prevailing.
"• They taught that God was a grand Spiritual Sun-
life on earth a probation-the spheres, different degrees
of comprehensive happiness or states of retributive suffer-
ing-each appropriate to the good or evil deeds done on
earth. They described the ascending changes open to
every soul in proportion to his own efforts to impro\'e.
"·They·all insisted that man was his own judge, in-
curred a penalty or reward for which there was no sub-
stitution. They taught nothing of Christ, absolutely
France 170
denied the idea of vicarious atonement-and represented
man as his own Saviour or destroyer.
" ' They spoke of arts, sciences, and continued activities,
as if the life beyond was but an extension of the present
on a greatly improved scale. Descriptions of the radiant
beauty, supernal happiness, and ecstatic sublimity mani-
fested by the blest spirit$ who had risen to the spheres of
Paradise, Heaven, and the glory of angelic companionships
melts the heart, and fills the soul with irresistible yearning,
to lay down life's weary burdens and be at rest with them.' "
Having shown that Spiritualism arose in France as in
Germany from the awakening of psychic powers evolved
by magnetism, and traced the footprints of the great
temple builders who have laid the foundation stones of the
spiritual edifice in the human system and steadily worked
upwards from matter to force, and from thence to spirit
in every gradation of sphere, life and progress, we recall
the pithy words of the Baron de Potet, who, in addressing
the would-be leaders of public opinion in his essay on the
"Philosophical Teaching of Magnetism," says:
" You savants of our country; you have not shown
yourselves better informed than the Siamese.
" For these si.xty years it bas been shouted in your ears :
The J
l-lagnetizers march to the discovery of a moral world;
all the phenomena they produce indisputably proves its
existence.
" You have declared that they were impo~tors, imbeciles,
and the most illustrious amongst you have only pronounced
a verdict which will attest to future ages your ignorance
or your insincerity.
•· Before the soul is disengaged from matter, it can, and
~oes, converse with pure spirits. Already it can gaze
prophetically on its own future destiny, by regarding the
condition of those who have gone before--but a step-
yet one which the eye of spirit alone can measure, and.if
men are spirits already, who can stay the eagle glance of the
soul into the land of its own inhe1itance ? "
In following up the history of Spiritualism in France,
although we find it has gained an immense foothold, and
exerted a wide-spread induence upon the popular mind, it
is nevertheless evident, that one of the chief obstacles
to its general acceptance has been its lack of internal unity,
and the antagonistic sentiments which have prevailed
amongst its acknowledged leaders.
Two of those who have figured most prominently in the
grand drama of French Spiritualism, and in all probability
exerted more influence upon public opinion than any other
members of its dramatis persona, were MM. Allan Kardec
and Pierart, the respective editors of the two leading
Spiritual journals, entitled La Revue Spirite and La Revue
Spiritualiste:. These may also be regarded as the repre-
sentatives of the two opposing factious known as Spiritual-
ists and Spiritists, the former teaching that the soul of man
undergoes b:Jt one mortal birth, and continues its progress
through eternity in spiritual states, the latter affirming the
<loctrine of Re-i::\carnation, and alleging that the one spirit
in man can and does undergo many incarnations in different
mortal forms.
l\1. Kardec and his followers represented the "Spiritists"
or Re-incarnationists-M. Pierart le::.ding the ranks of the
opposing faction most commonly called Spiritualists.
In respect to the question of testimony, it must be re-
membered that M. Kardec derived his communications
chiefly from those writing and trance mediums who might
have proved the most susceptible to his influence, and is
said to have persistently banished from his circles, not
only Mr. Home, :M. Bredif, and other physical mediums,
but all those who dirl not endorse his favourite dogma
through tht-ir communications.
Says the author of Nineteenth Century Miracles: It
France
must not be supposed that the schism which divided the
two leaders of French Spiritualism was confined to the
immediate sphere of action in which they moved. Scat·
tered sympathisers with the writings of Allan Kardec.
may be found all over the Continent of Europe, and in
small numbers in America also. Few people who read
works put forward vtith authoritative pretentious have the
faculty of thoroughly digesting what they read, hence,
when M. Kardeo's books were translated into the English
language, and it became the publisher's interest to aid in
their circulation, they found more readers than thinkers,
and their plausible style attracted more admiration than
sincere conviction. In France, no doubt M. Kardec's
personal influence, and strong phychological power, admir-
ably fitted him for a propagandist, and when we remember
how readily any doctrines eloquently advocated will
command adherents, especiallyamong restless and excitable
natures, we need be at no loss to discover why M. Kardec's
writings have become so popular and his opinions so
generally accepted by his readers. Little or no spiritual
literature was disseminated in the French language when
Allan Kardec's works were first published. He possessed
that indomitable energy and psychological inftuence in
which his much harassed rival Picrart was wanting. Thus
in a measure, the field of Continental spiritual propagandism
was his own, nor did he fail to make use of his great op-
portunities.
'• The successes achieved by Kardec's journal, La Ret•ue
Spirite, communicated a wave of influence also, which
propagated journals of a similar character all over the
country. Thus in 1864, there were no less than ten spirit-
ualistic periodicals published in France, under fhe following
titles: La Rer;ue Spirite, La Revue Spiritualiste, and L'Ave-
nir, Paris; four Spiritist journals published in Bordeaux,
which, in x865, became merged into L' Union Spirite Borde-
lalse; La Medium Evangelique, Toulouse ; L'Echo d'outre
Tombe. Marseilles ; . and La Virite, Lyons. The editors of
these journals are said to have been all followers of Allan
Karrlec, with the exception of M. Pierart, editor of La
Revue Spiritualiste."
It must be remarked that the doctrines of the Re-incar-
nationists, although defended with great ability by their
propagandists, who included many of the most capable
minds of France, were not suffered to pass without seYere
castigation on the part of their English neighhours; .and
it becomes necessary to note how the French spmtual
schism was received on the other side of the Channel. In
the London Spiritual111a~azim of 1865, the editor, in com-
menting on the ominous silence of the Spirite journals
concerning Dr. ~!aldigny's opera of Swedenborg says:-
.. It is worthy of note that the journals of the Kardec
school, so far as we have seen them, do not take the least
notice of this opera. The Avenir of Paris, which appears
weekly, but greatly wants facts, has not a word to say about
it. . . . . It is greatly to be regretted that the main object
of the Kardecian journals seems to be, not the demon-
stration of the constantly recurring facts of Spiritualism,
but the deification of Kardec's doctrine of Re-incarnation.
" To this doctrine--which has nothing to do with Spirit-
ualism, even if it had a leg of rea.son or fact to stand on-
all the strength, and almost all the space of these journals
is devoted.
" These arc the things which give the enemies of Spirit-
ualism a real handle against it, and·bring it into contempt
with sober minds. Re-incarnation is a doctrine which
cuts up by the roots all individual identity in the future
existence. It desolates utterly that dearest yearning of
the human heart for reunion with its loved ones in a per·
manent world. If some are to go back into fresh physical
bodies, and bear new names, and new natures, if they are
France 171
to become respectively Tom Styles, Ned Snooks, and a
score of other people, who shall ever hope to meet again
v.'itb his friends, wife, children, brothers and sisters ? Wbcn
he enters the spirit-world and enquires for them, he will
have to learn that they arc already gone back to earth,
and are somebody else, the sons and daughters of other
people, and will have to become over and over the kindred
of a dozen othe~ families in succession! Surely, no such
most cheerless crochet could bewitch the intellects of any
people, except under the most especial bedevilment of the
most sarcastic and mischievous of devils."
In the Janu:lry number for 1866, a still &tronger article
on this subject appe'\rs from the pen of Wm. Howitt, who
writes the following fearless words of protest against the
doctrine of Re-incunation :
.. In the Avenir of November 2nd, M. .Pczzani thinks he
has silenced M. Pierart, by asserting that without Re-
incarnation all is chaos and injustice in God's creation :
' In this world there are rich and poor, oppressed and
oppressors, and without Re-incarnation, God's justice
could not be vindicated.' That is to say, in M. Pezzani's
conception, God has not room in the infinite future to
punish and 1edress every wrong, without sending back
souls again and again into the flesh. M. Pczzani's idea,
and that of his brother Re-incarnationists is, that the best
way to get from Paris to London is to travel any number of
times from Paris to Calais and back again. We English,
that the only v;a.y is to go on to London at once. . . . As
to )1. Pezzani's notions Of God's injustice without Re-
incarnation, if souls were re-incarnated a score of times,
injustice between man and man, riches and poverty,
oppression ancl. wrong, all the enigmas of social inequality
would remain just then as now.
" In noticing these movements in the Spiritist camp in
France, we should be doing a great injustice i! we did not
refer to the zealous, eloquent, and unremitting exertions
of M. Pieratt in the Reuuc Spiritttalists, to expose and tesist
the errors o£ the Spirite to which we have alluded. The
d<><:trine of Re·incarnat.ion, M. Picrart has persistently
reststed and denounced as at once false, unfounded on any
evidence, and mrut pernicious to tbe character o£ Spirit-
udlism.''
Allan Kardec diecl on March 3rst, 1869.
Notwithstanding the !act that. the experimental method
of receiving communications tltrough physical mediurnship
was not in favour with M. Allan Kardec and his followers
there is an abundant amount of phenomena of all kin~
recorded in f';l. Pierart's excellent journal, La Reuue Spirit-
ualiste, also in many otlter European journals devoted to
the subject. From this we are about to select such facts
of a representative character as will give a general view
of French Spiritnalism in the nineteenth century.
The celebrated ·• Cure D'Ars," the founder of the D'Ar.;
" Providence," and many ot!Jer noble works of cilarity,
j ean Baptiste Vi:mney, was born in the vicinity of Lyons,
in 1786, in a humble sphere of life. His natural capacity
was by no means remlrkable, and at school he was only
remembered as a somewhat dull scholar. Circumstances
having opened up the w~y for his becoming a priest, al-
though he had only Latm enough to say mass, and no
lea~mog beyond the routine of his profession, yet his
am1able nature and unaffected piety won him friends
wherever he went. After some changes of fortune and the
rejection of two good offers of rich positions, which in his
extreme humility he did not deem himselffit for, he accepted
the p:lStoral Cll.1rge of the httle agricultural villa"e of
D' Ars, now in the arrondisement of Trevoux. <>
Very soon his reputation for beneficence drew round him
a much l.1rger circle of poor dependents than he could
provide for, and then it w45 that he commenced h1s extra-
France
ordinary life o£ faith, supplicating in fervent prayer for
whatever means were necessary to carry out his divine
mission of blessing to his unfortunate fellow creatures.
In this way the sphere of his benevolence, and the wonder-
ful results of the me::\ns he employed to maintain it, reached
proportions that could scarcely be credited.
But now a still more wonderful thing was tc happen in
the enchanted region of D'Ars. Persons afflicted with
disease began to experience sudden cures whilst· praying
before the altar, or making confessions to the Cure. The
fame of this new miracle soon spread abroad, until the
Abbe Monnin declares thi\t upwards Qf 2o,ooo persons an-
nually came from Germ'\ny, Italy, Bel~ium, and ~ll parts
of Frauce, and even from Engl:md, and that in less than
six years this number increased to an average o£ 8o,ooo.
Diseases of every kind that bad been pronounced incurable,
were dissipated at once. The indefatibagle Cure gave
himself up to the work, heart and soul. His church stood
open day and night, and the immense crowds that sur-
rounded it, were o\>liged to ""ait for hours and sometimes
days, to reach the good healer. No one was allowed to
take precedence of the rest, except in cases of extreme
poverty or extreme suffering. Princes, nobles, and-great
ladies, often drove up as near as they could to the church
in grand carriages, and manifc.sted the utmost astonishment
when informed that notwithstanding their rank, they could
not be admitted except in turn. The Cur6 only permitted
himself to take four hours sleep, namely from eleven to
three, and when he came to the confessional again, the
church and all the approaches to it were crowded with
those who had w.\ited all night to secure their places.
Omnibuses were established t<> convey patients from
Lyons to D'Ars, and the Saone was covered with boats full
of anxious pilgrims.
There can be no doubt thM the first well marl...ed impulse
which experimental spiritualism received through the
invocatory proces~es of the circle, in France, as in many
other countries of Europe, was due to the visits of :\1r.
D. D. Home, the celebrated non-professional physical
medium, and subsequently to tbe large influx of profes-
sional mediums. who found in France an excellent field for
the demonstration of their peculiar gfts.
Of Mr. Home's seances it would be superfluous to write,
he himself having related them in two volumes published
at different periods of his career, and his many admiring
friends having sufficiently described the marvels of which
they were witnesses in numerous magazines an<i newspaper
articles.
Mr. Home's mani1cstations were given in Fra11ce almost
exclusively to personages of rank, or those distinguished
by literary fame. He was a guest of royalty, the nobility,
and persons of the highest position. During his residence
in Paris, unde1 the Imperial regime, he was a frequent and
ever-welcome visitor at the court of the late Emperor
Louis Napoleon. A record of the manifestations produced
through his meiiumship was kept by command of the
E mpress, and frequently read to her favoured friends.
Amongst these memoranda is one which went the round
of the papers at the time of its occuncnce, hence there can
be no impropriety in alluding to it now. H stated that
on one occasion a seance was held at the Tuileries, when
none were present save the Emperor, the Empress, the
Duchess de Montebello, and Mr. D. D. Home.
On the ta.blc were placed pen, ink, aud paper, and
presently a spirit hand was seen, which dipped tile pen in
the ink anJ Jehberately wrote the name o£ the first ~apol­
eon, in a pcrlect fdt:Sim.ile of that monarch's handwriting.

quently p.15s:ng to those of the Empress, and ~Ir. Home.
Francis 172 Fraud
The Emperor carefully preserved this precious autograph,
and inscribed with it a memorandum to the effect that the
hand was warm. soft, and resembled exactly that of his
great predecessor and uncle.
As an evidence of the wide popularity to which the
subject of Spiritualism had attained in x86g, M, Pierart
quotes in one of his numbers of that year, an article from
the Sikle. a leading paper, but one which has hitherto
contaihed many notices inimical to Spiritualism. The
writer, M. Eug~ne Bonnem~re, says:
" Although somnambulism has been a hundred times
annihilated by the Academy of Medicine. it is more alive
than ever in Paris; in the midst of all the lights of the age,
it continues, right or wrong, to excite the multitude.
Protean in its forms, in1initc in its manifestations, if you
put it out o! the door. it knocks at the window; if that
be not opened, it knocks on the ceiling, on the walls; it
raps on the table at which you innocently seat yourselves
to dine or for a game of whist. If you close your ears to
its sounds, it grows excited, strikes the table, whirls it about
in a giddy ma~c, lifts up its feet, and proceeds to talk
through mcdiumship. as the dumb talk with their
6nl(ers.
·'You have all kno,vn the rage for table-turning. At
one time we ceased to ask after each other's health, but
asked how your table was. ' Thank you, mine turns
beautifully ; and bow goes yours on ? • Everything turned;
hats and the heads in them. One was led almost to believe
that a circle of passengers being formed round the main-
mast o! a ship of great tonnage, and a magnetic chain thus
established, they might make the vessel spin round till it
disappeared in the depth of the ocean, as a gimlet dis-
appl'ars in a deal board. The Church interfered; it
caused its thunders to roar, declaring that it was Satan
himsel! who thus raised the devil in the tables, and having
formally forbade the world to turn, it now forbade the
faithful to turn tables, hats, brains, or ships of huge sne.
But Satan held his own. The sovereign o! the nether world
passed into a new one, and that is the reason that America
sends us mediums, beginning so gloriously with the famous
Home, and ending with the Brothers Davenport. One
remembers with what a fren~y everyone precipitated him-
self in pursuit of mediums. Everyone wished to have one
of his own ; and when you introduced a young man into
society, you did not say, • He is a good waltzer,' but,' He
is a medium.' Official science has killed and buried this
Somnambulism a score of times; but it must have done it.

badly, for there it is as alive :lS cv,~r. only cbristi'ned

Am•Jn~st the many disti!lgnished adherents of Spiritual-
ism in tbe department of French literature, none have more
bravely asserted and defended their belief than Camille
Flammarion, the celebrated astronomer; Victor Hugo.
Alexandre Dumas, and Victorien Sardou, the renowned
writer o! French comedy. M. Sardou was himself a medium
of singularly happy endowments. He executed a number
of curious drawmgs, pur11orting to represent scenes in the
spirit world, amongst wb1ch was an exquisite and complex
work of art entitled, •· The House o! Mozart."

Fraud : A very large part is played b}' fraud in spiritualistic
practices. both in the physical and psychical, or automatic,
phenomena, but especially in the former. The frequency
with which mediums have been convicted of fraud has,
indeed, induced many people to abandon the study of psy-
chical research, judging the whole bulk of the phenomena
to be iraudulently produced. Yet the question of fraud is
itself an interesting and complicated one, not unworthy of
the attention o! the student. for we find in connection with
spiritualism not onlysimple deception practised with a view
to gaining pecuniary advantages, but also many instances
ofsystematic and apparently deliberate trickery where there
is no evident reward to be obtained. and even cases where
the medium is, so far as can bc,judged, entirely innocent
and ignorant of the fraud be obviously practises. And it
may be added that after all precautions have been taken
which science and commonsense can suggest, there remains
a portion of the phenomena which still continues to be
inexplicable, and which justifies the interest now so widely
shown in psychic scicnc.,.
In considering the important factor of frattll, we must
distinguish between conscious and unconscious fraud.
though, as will be shown hereafter, it is at times possible
!or the one to shade imperceptibly into the other. Con-
scious fraud most often appears in connection with the
physical phenomena. Almost at the outset of the spirit-
ualistic movement, i.e., in xSsx. three doctors. professors
of the University of Buffalo, N.Y., demons~ted that the
rappings which attended the Sisters Fox were produced by
the manipulation of the knee and toe joints, a fact which
was shortly afterwards corroborated by Mrs. Cluver, a
relative of the Fox !arnily. Since that time many
mediums have at one time or another been convicted of
fraud, and every phase of physical mediumship been dis-
credited. Slate-writing, spirit photography. materiali-
sation, have all in turn been exposed, though the latter,
at least, seems able to survive any number of exposures.
Time and again, sitters have beheld the form and features
of the medium in the materialised spirit; shadowy figures
in filmy draperies, have been shown to be mannikins
wrapped in muslin, and false beards and white draperies
have been found about the person of the medium. Apports
have been smuggled into the seance-room-jewels, flowers,
perfumes, objets d'art-in order to be showered upon the
sitters by generously·disposed ·• spirits." Threads and
human hairs have been used to move furniture and other
objects. Sometimes more elaborate and complicated
machinery is provided, but more often the medium depends
upon sleight o! hand and skilful suggestion to accomplish
his ends. Conjurers have frequently been admitted to
seances, and have !ailed to discover the modus operandi of
the various feats, but this fact, though a great deal has been
made of it by spiritualists, cannot be taken to have any
significance. since conjurers are often quite mystified by
each other's performances.
Another phase o! fraud is that illustrated by many
instances of soi-disanJ clairvO}'ance, where the medium
acquires !Jer information by muscle-reading, 01 by judicious
enquiry previous to the seance. Fraud of this Jcind may be
either conscious or unconscious.
Under the heading o! unconscious fraud must be classed
a large group of automatic phenomena. In many of the
more pronounced cases af automa~sm, the .normal con-
sciousness of the agent is not responstble for h•s acts, while,
on the other hand, there is:\ slighter degree o! automatism.
Fredegonda 173
where the agent may be partly conscious of, and respon-
sible for, his p~oductions . This latter state, if it be fre-
quently induced, anJ if the will !?ower of the automatist
be somewhat relaxed, may pass tnto the more profound
stage; so thatfraud which is at firstconscious and voluntary
may in time become unconscious and spontaneous. And
thus it is extremely difficult to know just when an accusa-
tion offraud may with justice be brought against a medium.
There is evidence that m..·my trance mediums reproduce in
their discourses information subconsciously acquired at
some more or less remote period ; the trance utterances of
:\Irs. Piper, :\Irs. Thomson. and others. reveal this peculiar-
ity. It is true that extensive and apparently fraudulent
arrangements are sometimes made before a seance, but
may it not be {1ossible thll.t, previous to a " physical" or
" psychical " s6ance, such preparations may 1>c made
automatic:tUy in a state approximating to the mediumistic
trance? If the hypnoti<; subject is not responsible-or is
only partly so-for the fulfilment of a post-hypnotic
promise, would it not be within reason to suppose th~t the
medium, in g:tining inf•lrmation concerning possible sitters,
in secreting apports about the person, is the victim of a
similar di~ociation of consciousness? There are facts not
a few which would support such a conclusion.
Spititualists themselves arc, from time to time, called
upon to face exposure~ of undoubted. f1'aud, and on these
occasions various apologies of a more or less ingenious
nature, are offered for the errin;; medium. Sometimes it
is said that the medium is controlled by mischievous spirits
(diakb), who m"\ke use of his physical organism to perform
tricks and deceptions. Ag.,in, it is stated that the medium
feels an irresistible tmpulse to perform the action which he
knows is in the mi:ld o£ the control. Thus E~,~sapia Palla-
dino would extend her hand involunbrily in the direction
in wluch movement of furniture was to take place, though
without actuJ.I contact-that tS, perceiving thilt the spirits
desired to move the object, she herself was impelled to
attempt a physical (and fraudulent) forestalling of the
action. Certain of the investigators who examined the
phenomena in connection with the latter medium have also
declared ttut their production costs Eusapia a great deal
of pain and fatigue, and that she therefore seizes re:<dily
upon an opportunity of producing them easily and without
trouole. Such an opportunity, they held, only presented
itself when their rigorous precautions wete relaxed. The
same has also be-enstated in connection with other mediums.
In tbe case of a m.uerhlisation seance, when the spirit form
is grasped and found to be the medium herself, these
apologists offer an explanation, as follows: A certain
amount of tbe medium's physical energy is imparted to the
spirit. If the latter he roughly handled.. spirit anrl medium
will unite for their joint benefit, either within or without
the cabinet-if the medium possesses most energy. she will
draw the spirit to her, if the most of the energy is with the
materialised spirit, it is the medium who will instantly be
attracted to the spirit. That it is the latter alternative
which invariably takes place is a fact which has no signifi-
cance for good spiritualists. Or they may insist, as did
Sergeant Cox, on one occasion, that the medium is con-
trolled to impersonate a spirit. But whatever be the reason
for fYaud, it is clear that not the most ingenuous medium
is to be trusted for a moment, thou~h his character in
normal life be blameless, and no object in committing
fraud be apparent ; and that investigators must rely only
on the strictest vigilance and the most up-to-date scientific
methods and apparatus.

Freemasonry-History and Origin: Though it would not
be exactly correct to say that the history of Fl'eemasonry
was lost in the mists of antiquity, it is competent to remark
Freemasonry
that althuogh to a certain degree traceable, its records are
of a scanty nature, and so crossed by the trails of otber
mystical brotherhoods, that disentanglement is an ex-
tremely difficult process. The ancient legend of its founda-
tion at the time of the building of the Temple at Jerusalem
is manifestly traditional. If one might hazard an opinion,
it would seem that at a very early epoch in the history of
civilization, a caste of builders in stone arose, who jealously
guarded the secret of their craft. In all probability this
caste was prehistoric. It is not unreasonable to assume
this when we j)osscss plenty of proof that an ancient caste
of bronze-workers flourished in every country in Europe
and Asia; and if this be admitted, and it cannot well be
refuted in the light of recent researches,-(see journal of
the Gypsy Lore Society for 19t3)-there is nothing absurd
or impos;ible in the contention that a simil?.r school of
workers in stone should have arisen at a like early period.
We know that it is probable that the old caste of bronze-
workers had an esoteric language of their own, which has
c~me do_wn to us as the Shclta T~ari (q.v.) spoken generally
by the tmkler people of Great Bntain and Ireland. Ifsuch
a caste can elaborate a secret language anc.l cling jealously
to the " mysteries" of metal-working. there is no reason
to doubt the existence of a similar caste of masons. We
tender this theory for what it is worth, as it is unsupported
by any great authority on the subject. Where such a
caste of operative masons rtrose is altogether a separate
question, and cannot be dealt with here; but it must ob-
viously have been in a country where working in stone was
one of tbe principal arts. It is also almost cert-<~.in that
this e:lrly brotherhood must have been hierophantic. Its
principal work to begin with would undoubtedly consist
in the raising of temples and similar structures, and as such
it would come into very close contact with the priesthood,
if indeed it was not wholly directed by it. In early civil-
ization but two classes of dwelling receive the attention of
the architcct,-the temple and the palace. For example,
among the ruins of Egypt and Babylon, remains of the
private bouse are rare, but the temple and the royal resi-
dence are everywhere conspicuous, and we know that among
the ruins of Central America temples and palaces alone
rennin-the huts of the surrounding dwellers having loug
ago disappeared. The temple is the nucleus of the early
city. Around the worsl1ip of the ~:ods cryst."\llises com-
merce, agriculture, and all the affa:rs of life. AU roa<ls
lead to the temple. Striding for a moment over t!le gap
of years between early Babylon and Egypt and medireval
Britain, we find the priesthood in close touch with the
masons. A medireval cathedral took more than one gen-
eration to erect, and in that time many m:J.Sons came and
went around the fane. The lodge was invariably founded
hard by the rising cathedral or abbey, and ap,Prentices and
others were entered as opportunity offered : mdeed a man
might serve his apprenticeship and labour all through his
life upon the one building. without everseeing any work else-
where. The evidence as to whether the master-masons
were also architects is very conflicting. and it has been held
that the priests were the architects of the British cathe-
drals,-the master-masons and operatives merely carrying
out their designs. There is good evidem:e however that
this is not wholly true. Authorities arc at one in declaring
that of all arts architecture is by far the most intricate.
It is undoubtedly the one which requires a long and specific
training. Questions of stress and strain of the most
difficult description arise, and it seems incredible that
anyone with the most superficial knowledge of the subject
should believe that ecclesiastics, who bad not undergone
any special training should be qualified to compose plans
of the most perfect and intricate description for the most
noble and remarkable edifices ever raised in this country..
Freemasonry 114 Freemasolll'J
We know that professional architects existed at a very
early period; and why the priei~hood should be credited
with their w~k. it is difficult to understand ; but instances
are on record where the priests of a certain locality have
taken to themselves the credit of planning the cathedral
of the diocese. Be this as it may, the " mystery" o£ build-
ing was sufficiently deep to require extensive knowledge
and experience and to a great extent this justifies the
jealousy ""ith wbit:b the early masons regarded its secrets.
Again, this jealousy with wbich it was keptfrom the vulgar
gaze may have bee11 racial in its origin, and may have
arisen from such considerations as the !ollowin~ . " Let
no stranger understand this craft of ours. Why should
we make it free to the heathen and the foreir;:ner? " This
also smacks of priestcraft, but if masonry originated hiero-
phantically, it certainly did not continue a. preserve uf any
religion, and is nowadays probably the chiefest abomination
of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, which has not hesitated
to publish and disseminate the grossest libels regarding
it. It is to Dritain tilat we must look for evi<ience as to the
evolutionary line of masonry. Before the founding of the
Grand Lodge, we .find that York and the North of England
in gener<>l was reg<!.rdcd as the most ancient seat of t.he
fratt-rnity in this island. Indeed without stretching prob-
abilities too far, the line ot evolution so fur as York 'is con-
~l'rned is quite remarkable. We know for example that
m the early days of that city a temple of Serapis existed
there, which was afterwards a monastery of the Beggiug
Friars, and the mysteries of this god existed beside
the Roman Collef;ia or Craftsmen's Society. It is also
considered that the crypt of York l\liuster a1iords e,·idence
of the progress of masonry from Roman to Sa:ocon time<;.
It is stnted that it ha<; a mosaic pavement of blue and
white tiles laid in the form employ<'d in the first deg:-ee
of masonry, and is said to show the sites of three seats used
by the master and his wardens during the constrnction of
tbe 'building. It is also an undoubted fact that the craft
occasionally met in this crypt during last century. There
is thus reason to belieYe even though the evidence be of a
scanty nature (but the foregoing does not eml.>r<.<:e all of
it) tbr.t the early masons of Britain were probably influ-
enced by Romano-Egyptian mystical societies, and that
their own craft societies drew some of their practices r..nd
constitutions from these alien schools. Masonic tr:>.ditic>n
goes to show that even in the beginning of the fourteenth
century masonry in Britain was then regarded as a tl'ing
of great antiquity. Lodge records for the most p<:.rt oaly
date back to the sixteenth century in the oldest instances,
but ancient manuscripts are extant which un1oubtedly
relate to masonry. Thus the old charges embodied in the
Regius ~IS. which was unearthed in 1839 by :\Jr, Halliwell
Phillips are dated at 1390, and contr.in a curions legend of
the craft, which tells how the necessity of finding '~·ork of
some description drove men to consult Euclid, who recom-
mended masonry as a craft to them. It goes on to tell
how masonry was founded in Egypt, and how it entered
England in the time of Athelstan. The necessity for keep-
ing c:lose counsel as regards the secrets of the craft i~ insisted
upon in rude verse. The Cooke J\TS. dates from the first
part of the fifteenth century, and likewise contains versions
of the old charges. Egypt is also regarded here as the
mother-land of masonry, and,Athelstan is the medium for
the introduction of the craft into the island of Britain. But
that this manuscript was used among masons at a later
date was proved by the discovery of a more modern version
dated about 1687, in 1890, and known as the \Villiam \Yat-
son 115. In all about seventy of these old charges and
pseudo-histories have been discovered since 186o. They
have all much in common and are of English origin.
A great deal has been written to attempt to prove that
British freemasonry borrowed extensively from continental
secr~t ~ieties, such as tb~ !?teinmetzin of Germany. the
Rostcruc1ans (q.v.) and smular feUowshlps. The truth
probablv lies however in the circumstance that the coming
and goinJl' of students of occultism throughout Europe was
so constant, and so frequent were their communications
that practically all those societies were in touch ~ith one
another. Agam many persons belonged to several of them
at once, and imported the rules and constitution of one
body into another. No student of occultism can fail to
be struck with the close resemblance of the cor.stitutions
of nearly all the mystical fel!ow~h.!ps of the middle ages,
and the resemblance o£ the verbiage employed by their
founders and prot1:1gonists. It must also be insisted that
the speculative or mystic part of masonry was in the middle
ages merely a tradition with the brotherhood, JVhatever it
may have been in earlier times, and whatever clo~e con-
nection the craft may have had with hierophantic or mystic
philosophy. The speculative element, we repeat, was
merely traditional and symbolical as at present, and not
practical ; bnt this tr,;.dition was to serve to keep alight
the flame of speculative mysticism which was to be aroused
ag3in at the end of the medi:eval period. When political
freedom awoke iu Europe, the necessity for the existence
?f secret societies vanished, but the persons who delighted
m their formation and mana.gement still remained. The
raison d'itre of these fellowships bad disappeared, but the
love of mysticism, not to say the mysterious, was per-
ha_PS stronger than ever. What then occurred? Simply
th1s: that all those persons who found the occupation of
floating ;~nd managing real secret societies gone, cc.st about
Cor anything in the shape of a mystical fellowship that they
could find. They soon discovered the craft of masonry
wbich although operative possessed mystical traditions.
The attraction was mutual, and astrologers, alchemists
and others soon crowdro t.he lodges, to such pnrpose that
at the lodge held in 1646 in London, there was not an oper-
ative mason present, apd at that l:eld in 1682, the spccu-
latin branch was overwhelming in its numbers. Harking
back a little, it is noteworthy thAt the freema.sons in me-
di:cval times formed a fellowship or guHd closely resembling
in its con!;titution that ofsimilar trade guilds both in.Britain
and the continent; such as the \\"cavers, Tailors, Fish-
mongers, anrl. so forth. B ut although these guilds preserved
their ·· mysteri(;S," where t.hey possessed them, with con-
siderable jealousy, they do not appear to have embedded
in their constitutions the same ::nc:ent practices and ritual
which fl'O to show so strongiy thc.t masonry is undoubtedly
an institution of great antiquity.
It h:1s also been suggested that freemasonry \loaS mbo-
duced into Europe by the Xnight~ Templar. It would be
difficult to discover a similar institution which in the opinion
of some authorities had uot·been founded bv that order;
and it is rlifficult to believe that the haushty chivalry of
l\otman .times would have claimed any connection what-
soever with an operative craft. There arc, however, many
connections between alchemy and masonry.. For example
in the Ordit~all of Alchymy compiled by Thomas Norton,
(q.v.), the freemasons are alluded to as workers in it. In
1630, we find Fludd (q.v.) using language which smacks
strongly of freemasonry. His society wa.s divided into
degrees, and the :\!asons' Company of London had a copy
of the masonic charges presented by him. \"aughan also
appears to have been a freemason, and many masons of the
middle of the seventeenth century, such as Robert :\foray
and Elias Ashmole, were diligent students of occult science.
and Sir Christopher \Vren was a student of hermetic art.
It has often been put fon"ard that Scotland was the
original home of freemasonry in these islands, but although
the craft was undoubtedly ancient in that country, there
Freemasonry 175 Fritzlar
docs not appear to be any adequate proof that it was older
than in England. Some of the Scottish lodges, such as No. I
Edinburgh. Kilwinning, and Aberdeen, possess very ancient
records, and it is probable that this has led to the assump-
tion that the brotherhood was of 1-(re:-~ter antiquity in North
Britain than in Eng-hnd. But the circumstance tlu>.t the
craft was probably introduced into England in Roman
times, where it has in all likelihood flourished ever since,
tends to dispose of such a theory. The history of modern
freemasonry begins with the formation of the Grand Lodge
of England, which was inaugurated on St. John the Bap-
tist's Day 1717 by several old lodges. This represented the
first central governing body of the fraternity, and before
this time e.!.Ch lodge had been self-governing. Many lodges
speedily came under its ;:egis, and Ireland formed a Grand
lodge of her own in 1725 but Scotland did not follow till
1736, and even then many lodges held aloof from the cen-
tral body, only 33 o~t of too falling into line. FTom one
or other of these three governing bodies all the regular lodges
throughout the world have :1-riscn, so that modern masonry
may truthfully be said to be of entirely flritish origia.
This is not thQ place to enter into an elaborate discussion
of the history and affairs of modern masonry, and we are
chiefly exercised regarcling its mysticnl position and ten-
dencies. Regarding these we must be brief. As regards
the lower ranks of the craft, it consists almost entirely in
these islands at least of persons who have in great measure
treated it as a mere friendly society, and it is only in the
higher ranks that any re.\1 idea of the true significance of
the mystical tenets preserved nnd taught is retained. The
ordinary mason, who preserves a cryptic and mysterious
silence when the affairs of his craft arc alluded to, merely
serve~ as a laughing-stock to the motlern well-equippej
mystic. Certain signs and handgrips are in usc amongst
masons, and the possession of tltes2, and of a ritual
the significance of which he rarely comprehends,
the :wcrage brother fondly imagines, renders him
somewhat superior to the layman. It is extremely doubt-
ful if among even the higher r.mks of m:1sonry, the deepest
~ignif.cance of the tmdttlon of the craft is thoroughly re;~.l­
ISed, and if the absurd works which everv now and then
emanate from eminent ma'>ons rc~t.~rding the history of
their craft be accept-ed as criteria of their higher knowledge,
it l!iust indeed be of slight propo::tions. Res.\nling tlte
grar.d secret, or secrets, of m1sonry. the layman mi\y rest
..:o:nfoftably assured th:J.t if he h'l.'> hiled to join the brothe!'-
hood, he has missed no fact o( supreme importnnce by so
doing. There is no" secret" at all. The original secrets in
conuection with the cr<lft were those of operative masons,
who were jealous of their position as workmen, and who
nghtly enough did not believe in givin~ a woJ.y business
secrets to all <lnd sundry ; but lhe so-called " secrets " of
moderu speculati·,re m:~sonry arc merely such as have
orousht alchemy, astrology, ancl the kindred sciences into
unthin~ng. disrep~te n.mo.ng those who do not recognise
the1r s1gmncance m the htsiory of human thought. This
is not to say that masonry as a whole consists of mere clap-
trap. The trend of its entire constitution is nowadan
frankly mystical, but it is a mysticism which is only half
understood by the lower ranks of the craft, and which is
imperfectly recognised hy its higher officers. Its tenetE
are unquestionably mystic and lofty, but masonic
transcendentalism has scarcely kept in line with the more
modern forms of mysticism. From time to time new de-
grees have been formed which have in some me~ure recti·
lied this, but the nuntber of masons qualified to understand
~he nature of the vast and mighty truths conveyed in th<!Se,
1S naturally extremely small. and it is as a friendly society
that the brotherhood effects its greatest good.
As has been said, continental masonry is undoubtedly
the offspring of British sy$tcms. This is not to say that
in France and Germnny there were no masonic lodges in
existence before the formation of the English Grand Lodge;
but all modern lodges in these countries undoubtedly date
from the inception or the English central body. French
masonry possessed and possesses many rites which differ
entirely from those accepted by the Blitish craft. We
find the beginnings of modern French masonry in the labours
of Martinez Pasqu:~lly (q.v.), St..Martin (q.v.), and perhaps
to a gre'\t extent in those of Cagliostro (q.v .) who toiled
greatly to found his Egyptian rite in France. It is notice-
able, however, that he had become a member of a London
lodge before attempting this. In France, masonry has
always h2.d more or less a political complexion, and uow-
adays the extreme enmity existing between it c.nd the
Roman C:1tholic church in that country favours the inclu·
sion in its ranl..s of persons possessing ideals by no means
in consonance with the very upright standard of British
masonry. In Germany, it has been said that the Stein-
metzin app~oxim:-~ted very strongly in mcdi;cval times
to the British m:>.sons, if tl1ey were not origioall)' one
and the s:1mc; but the later lodges in Germany all date
from that founded i:l 1733·
The entrance of masons into the various degrees involves
an chborate system of symbolic ritual, of which the essence
is uniform throughout all lodges. The members arc classi·
ficd in numerous degrees, of which the first three ;tre entered
apprentice, fellow-craft, and master-mason. Each lodge
po3~es5cs its own byelaw~. s•tbject to the Book of (;(mstitu-
tion of the Grand Lodge.
'Wild stories have been circulated, chiefly by the Roman
Catholic enemies of masonry, regnrding the practice of
diabolic occultism in the higher ranks of the craft. To
begin with, it is extremely unlikely that more than three
or four persons connected with it possess the requisite
knowledge to thus offend against the Christian proprieties,
and the childish asseverations of French writers on the
subject may be dismissed with a smile. The " occultism"
anrl ·' transcendentalism" of the majority of zealous breth-
ren are usu.'llly of the mildt'st character possible, and are
in some me:lsure related to the filysterious attitude of the
ave;-age masoa, when dark hints as to lodge doings :1-re
whls;::ered of among his admiring relatives.

Fritzlar, Martin Von : German alchemist. (Circa, 1750.)
fhe dates of the blrth and death of thi3 alchemist have
never been ascertaiued, but he is known to have lived in
the first half of the eighteenth ccutury, while he appears to
have been a HessiJ.n, resident chiefly at Ute village of
Firtzlar. \Vhile a young man, he studied pharmacy,
mtending to make it his profession; but he soon ~trewinter­
ested in the quest of gold-making, and, when the celebrated
alchemist, Lascaris, came to Germany, }lartin hastened to
his presence with a view to gleaning his secrets. Along
Fumigation 176 Gastromaocy
'\lith several other young men, the Hessian was allowed to
witness numerous experiments, and while he w.1tched them,
it seemed to him that the great secret lay open before him;
but afterwards, when he made attempts on his own account,
he found that Lascaris had duped him sham~lully. and had
even taken advantage of his ignorance. Tnereupon, in
contradistinction to the m'ljority of thwarted alchemists,
he renounced the futile se'\rch altogether, vo,ved fealty
to bis ori~n:ll c'\lling, and devoted the rc>t of his life thereto.

GaleottL, Martlus : Italian Astrologer. (t442-1494). Born
in 1-142, this lt:J.li:J.n .asCrolo~er and theolo6ian, ap~ars to
have been a native ,,f ~hrni, in Umbria; but it would seem
that be left Italy while a young man, ani settled for a while
at Boulogne. Here, he gave grave offence to the Church
of Rome by promulgating th~.doctrine that good works are
not the road to s.t.lvation, and that this is only to be ob-
tained by f:J.ith in Christ; and, finding the priests around
him growing daily more :\nd more hostile, Gale]tti saw fit
to leave France for Hunpry, where he became se!:retary
to the king, Matthias Covirnus, and also tutor to the latter's
son, Prince John. llis secret::~rial and tutorial duties.
however, did not occupy the whole of his time; and,
besides m'lking himself an expert astrolo~er, he wrote a
book caUed, De jncose Dietis et Factis Regis Matthitz Covirr.i.
Some of the tenets cont.'\ined therein were the means of his
incurring fresh ill-will from the clergy; and eventually,
thei.r rancour became so great, indeed, that the writer was
seized and taken to Venice, where he was imprisoned for a
while. He was relc;lsed anon, chieflyowing to the influence
of the Pope. Sixtus IV, whose tutor he is said to have been
at an earlier and indeterminate date; and, thereupon,
Galeotti returned to Franc~. where he came under the notice
of the king, Louis XI., who appointed him his state-astrol-
oger. Thenceforth, for many years, the Italian acted in
this onerous capacity, sometimes living within the precincts
of the royal castle of Plessis-les-Tours. sometimes at the
town of Lyons; and oace, in t478, while staying at the
latte1 place, and being informed that Louis was approaching.
he rode out to meet him, fell from his hor:.e. and died
shortly afterward~as a rt'sult of injuriessustained in the fall.
An especial interest att:~.ches tl) Gale111i in th'lt he a?pe::~rs
in Sir Walter Scott's inimitable story of medireval France,
QuentiJJ' Drtrward. Early in the talc, soon after Quentin
has entered the Scots Guard of Louis XI., the I:J.tter and his
new guardsman are depicted as visiting the a~trologer, the
King being anxious for a prophecy regJ.rding Quentin's
immediate future. The sc~ne is a very memorable and
graphic one, among the best in the whole book ; and it is
histodcally valuable, moreover, containing, as it does,
what is probably a fairly accurate description of the kind
ofstudy used generally by an astrologer in the middle ages.
Galeotti is represented, ·• curiously examining a specimen,
just issued from the Frankfort Ptess, of the newly invented
art of printing " ; and the King questions him about this
novel process, whereupon the seerspeaks of the vast changes
it is destined to bring about throughout the whole world.
Now, it was by no means thoughtlessly or carelessly, that
Sir Walter introduced this passage, for, though the novelist
himself does not re1er to the matter in his notes, and though
Andrew Lang says nothing thereon in those annotations
which be furnished for the " Border ·waverley," it is a fact
that Louis was keenly interested in printing ; and, soon
af~e~ the craft first made its appearance, the King com-
mtsSloneJ t!le director of his mint, one Nicholas Janson or
Jenson, to ~ive up his presont post in !.t.vour of studying
typography, with a view to its l>ein~ c~uricd on in France.

Gastromaocy, or D1vioation from the Belly, is now generally
explained by ventriloquism, the voice in both cases sound-
ing IO\v and hollow, as if issuing from the ground. Salverte
enforces this opinion, and adds : " The name of En-
gastrimythes, given by the Gree'.c.s to the Pythia! (priestesses
Gaudillon 177 Genius
of Apollo) ind1cates that they made qse of this artifice."
The explanation is only partial, and the text of Isaiah:
" Thy voice shall die as one that hath a f.,miliar spirit,"
is inapplicable in such an argument. Those who are
experienced in clairvoyance are aware that the voice is
often reduced very low, in consequence of a change in the
respiration. This \vas the case with some of the ancient
Pythonesses, though instances may have occurred when
ventriloquism was resorted- to, as by the wizards of Green-
land in our own time.
Another method of practising the ancient gastromancy
connects it with crystal-seeing, a« vessels of gla..o;s, round,
and full of clear water, were used. which were placed before
several lighted candles. In this case, a young boy or girl
was generally the seer, and the demon was summoned in a
low voice by the magician. Replies were then obtained from
the magical appearances seen in the illuminatedglass vessels.

Gaufrldl, Louis : A French ecclesiastic, b:.~rned as a sorcerer
at Aix, in t6II. He was a cure at :llhrscillcs, where his
attractive person and manners gained for him a footing in
high ~ociety, but for all his priestly garb, he led an evil life.
A girl whom he had seduced was sent by her parents to a
convent of Ursulines, and here Gaufridi followed her. mak-
ing the credulous nuns believe that a legion of demons
possessed the convent. At the instance 'Of the exorcist,
who relieved the "possessed" nuns Gaufridi was tried at
Aix, and condemned .to be burned alive.
Gauber-Abad : Meaning the Abode of Jewels. This was
the name given to one of the capitals of the peris of Persian
romance. These were beings of an angelic or well-disposed
nature, who inhabited the earth, along with the divs or
evil-disposed, before the creation of man. After this event,
the peris became inhabitants of the ::erial regions, and had
three capitals: Shad-u-kam (pleasure and desire}, Gauher-
abad, and Amber-abad (city of Ambergris).
Gauthier, Jean : An alchemist. Charles IX. of France,
deceived by his promises, had him provided with a hundred
and twenty thousand pounds, with which to m ~ke gold,
and the adept set to work. But after he had worked for a
week, he ran away with the lGng's money. He was pur-
sued, captured, and hanged.
Gauthier of Bruges : It is related that a Franciscan monk,
made a bishop by Pope !'icholas III., and deposed by
Clement V., appealed to God against his deposition, and
asked that he should be buried with his act of appeal in his
hand. Some time after his death, Pope Clement V., visited
Poitiers, and, finding himself one day in a Franciscan
monastery, asked to see the remains of him whom he had
deposed. He caused the tomb to be opened, and was
horrified to secGauthierofBYuges presenting hisact of appeal,

Geber, otherwise Abou Moussah Djafar al Sofi, was a native of
Haman, in 1\Iesopotamia, or, according to ot her accounts,
a Spanish Moor, born at Savilc, somewhere about the end
of the eighth century, though all dates concerning him arc
e_xtremely doubtful. Practically nothing is known of his
hfe. He undertook wide experiments in metallurgy and
chemistry, with the object of discovering the constituent
elements of metals, in the course of which he stumbled upon
nitric acid and red oxide of mercury. It is, indeed, upon
actual discoveries that his reputation is based, and not upon
the many spurious treatises which have been attributed to
him, and which embrace the entire gamut of the sciences.
His alleged extant works, which arc iu Latin, cannot but
be regarded with suspicion, especially as several medi.eval
writers adopted his name. It is believed, however, that
the library at Leyden, and the Imperial Library at Paris,
contain Arabic manuscript!>, which might be referred to his
authorship. His Sum of Perfcctioll, and his iflvestigation
i11to the Perfectioll of .\letaJs are his most important works,
a complete edition of which was pubished at Dantzic,
in 1682, and again in the B'ibliotheca Chemica Curiosa, of
Mangetus, published at Cologne, in 1702. The Sum of
Perfeaio~ professes to draw its inspiration.from alchemical
authors, who lived previous to Geber, but as alchemy was
then not very far advanced, the derivation is an un-
likely one. We arc told in its pages that success in the
great art is only to be achieved by rigid adherence to
natural law. A spirit of grcal strength and a dry water
are spoken of as the elements of the natural principle.
The philosophic.."\I furnace and its arrangeiUcnt is dealt with
in detail, as is the philosopher's vessel, a vase of glass with
several intricate details difficult of comprehension. There
is no dubiety, however, regarding the absolutely physical
ba..<sis of metallurgy, upon which the work is composed,
and it contains no hint of allegory or the achievement of
success through supernatural agency.
Gehenna (otherwise Hell) : The word is derived from the
Hebrew gc and fli>mom, the Valley of Hinnom-originally
a valley in Palestine where the Jews passed their children
through the fire to .Moloch, the god of the Ammonites.
Gehenna is popularly regarded as a place of to1ment to
which the wicked are consigned when they leave this earth:
it is pictured as a bottomless pit, lit only by the fire which
is never quenched. In Dante and l'vlilton, we have diverse
descriptions of Hell-the one of unutterable anguish, horror
and despair; the other more sublimely imaginative, and
pierced with rays of faith and love. The locality of Hell,
and the duration of its torments, have for centuries been
the subject of much questioning. By some, it is believed,
that there is a purgatorial region-a kind of upper Gehenna,
"in which the souls of just men are cleansed by a tem-
porary punishment" before they are admitted to Heaven.
It WclS believed th:l.t during this period the soul could re-
visit the places and persons whom it had loved. By the
Persians, Gehemra was understood as the place inhabited
by the divs, or rebellious angels, and to which they had
been confined when they refused to bow down before the
first man. Gehe•ma is used in the New Testament for Hell,
and is practically synonymous with the Greek" Hades."
Gematria : along with temurah, was the science of the dual
interpretation of the Kabalistic alphabet, which composed
the notary art, which is fundamentally the complete science
of the tarot (q.v.) signs and their complex and varied appli-
cation to the definition of all secrets.
Genealum Dierum : (See Avicenna.)
Genius : Is generally used as the name of a superior class
of rerial beings, holding an intermediate rank between
mortals and immortals. That, at least, appears to be the
signification of "Daemon," the corresponding term in
Greek. It is probable, that the whole system of Demono-
logy W.lS invented by the Platonic philosophers, and
engrafted by degrees on the popular mythology. The
Platon.ists professed, however, to derive their doctrines
from the " theology of the ancients," so that this system
may have come originally from the East, where it formed
a part of the tenets of Zoroaster. This sage ascribed all
the operations of nature to the agency of celestial beings,
the ministers of one supreme first cause, to whose most
visible and brilliant image, Fire, homage was paid as his
representative. Some Roman writers speak of "the
Genius" as ·• the God of Nature," or " Nature " itself,
but their notions seem to have been modified by, if not
formed from, etymological considerations, more likely to
mislead than to afford a certain clue to the real meaning
of the term. At a later period, they supposed almost every
Germany 178
created thing, animate or inanimate, to be protected by its
guardian genius, a sort of demi-god, who presided over its
birth, and was its constant companion tiU its death. Thus,
Censorinus, who lived a9out the middle of the third cen-
tury, wrote as follows: "The genius is a god supposed to
be attendant on everyone ft'om the time of his birth....
Many think the ;!nius to be the same as the Iars of the
ancients. . . . Vve may well believe that its power over
us is great, yea, absolute. . . . Some ascribe two genii
at lea.~t to those who live in the houses of married persons."
Euclid, the Socratic philosopher, gives two to every one,
a point on which Lucilius, in his " Satires," insists we can-
not be informed. To the genitcs, therefore, so powerful
through the whole course of one's life, they offered yearly
sacrifices. As the birth of every mortal was a peculiar
object of his guardian genitu's solicitude, the marriage-
bed was called the genial bed, " lectus genialis " ; the
same invisible patron was supposed also to be the author
of joy and hilarity, whence a joyous was caUed a genial
life, " genialis vita." There is a curious passage relating
to the functions of the Greek demons in the Symposium
of Plato, in which he says: (Speech of Socrates) "from it
(i.e., the agency of genii) proceed all the arts of divination,
and all the science of priests, with respect to sacriiices,
initiations, incantations, and everything, in short, which
relates to oracles and enchantments. The deity holds no
direct intercourse with man; but, by this means, all the
converse and communications between the gods and men,
whether asleep or aw·.1ke, take place; and he who is wise
1n these things is a man peculiarly guidoo by his genius."
'Ve here see the origin of the connection between demono-
logy and magic ; an association perpetually occurring in
the romances of the East, if the Jinns oftheMussulmans can
be identified with the g~nii of the Platonists. (See also Jinn,)
Germany : For early German magic, see Teutons,
Magic as formulated and believed in by the Germans
in the Middle Ages, bears, along with traces of its u!lmis-
takable derivation from the ancieat Teutonic religion, the
~mpress of the influence wrought by the natural character-
istics of the country upon the mind of its inhabitants
Deep forests, gloomy mountains, limitless morasses.
caverned rocks, mysterious springs, all these helped to
shape the weird and terrible imagination which may be
traced in Teutonic mythology, and later in the darker and
more repulsive aspects of magic and witchcraft, which
first arose in Germany, and there obtained ready credence.
As the clash and strife of Teuton and Roman, of Christian
and Heathen have left indelible records in folk-lore and
history, so we may find them as surely in the m·.1gical
belief of the Middle Ages. The earlier monkish legends
are replete with accounts of magic and sorcery. indicating
plainly the process by which the ancient deities had become
evil and degraded upon the introduction of the newer
religion. Miracles are recounted, where these evil ones
are robbed of all power at the name of Christ, or before
some blessed relic, then chained and prisoued beneath
mountain, river and sea in eternal darkness, whilst it was
told how misfortune and death were the unvarying rewards
for those who still might follow the outcast gods.
Again, the sites and periods of the great religious festivals
of the Teutons are perpetuated in those said to be the
place and time of the Witches' Sabbath and other myster-
ious meetings and conclaves. Mountains esfo~cially
retained this character-as the Venusb~g. the Horselberg,
and Blocksberg, now become the Devil's realm and abode
of the damned. Chapels and cathedrals were fuU of relics,
\vhose chief virtue was to exorcise the spirjts of evil, while
the bells must be blessed, as ordained by the Council of
Cologne, in order that " demons might be affrighted by
their sound, calling Christians to prayers; and when they
lied, the persons of the faithful would be secure; that the
destruction of lightnings and whirlwinds.would be averted,
and the spirits of the storm defeated."
Storms were always held to be the work of the Devil,
or the conjuration of his followers. I n their fury might be-
heard the trampling of his infernal train above the tossing-
forests or holy spires, and here is seen the transformation
Odin and his hosts had undergone. Another instance of
this is found when the Valkyries, the Choosersof the Slain,
riding to places of battle, have become the medi<evaT
witches riding astride broom-sticks,on their missions of evil.
Castles of dames, where the Devil holds wild revel ; con-
claves of corpses revivified by evil knowledge; unearthly
growths, vitalized by hangect men's souls, springing to life
beneath gallows and gibbets; little men of the hills,
malicious spirits, with their caps of mist and cloaks of
invisibility; in these may be seen the meeting of the
Heathen and Christian stories, and the origins of that
terrible belief in magic, and its train of terror and death,
which is one of the darkest mysteries of the Jl.fiddle Ages.
Witchcraft \V".lS at fin;t derided as a delusion by men of
sense and education, and belief in it wa.s actually forbidden
by some of the earlier council~. It was in the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries that it attained prominence,
helped greatly thereto by the fact that magic, sorcery and
witchcraft had now becomea crimein the eyes of the Church
-a crime punishable by confiscation and death. It may
be truly said that the Holy Fathers and Inquisitors first
systematised and formulated Black Magic. Under such
authority, belief in it ftourished, filling the people with
either an abject fear or unholy curiosity.
The motives for laying the charge of sorcery and witch-
craft at a person's door were, of course, many besides that
of care for the soul; for personal feuds, political emmties,
religious differences and treasury needs found in this an
uniailing and sure means of achieving their infamous ends.
However tr.is might be, the charges were hurled at high
and low, and death thereby reaped a plentiful harvest.
The famous Council of Constance began the years of
terror with its proscription of the doctrines of Wyclif and
the burni:1g of John Huss and Jerome of Prague. At tbis
time, too, a work was published by one of the Inquisitors,
called the Formicarium, a comprehensive list of the sins
against religion and in the fifth volume an exhaustive ac-
count was gi·1en of that of sorcery. The list of crimes
accomplished by witches is detailed, such as second sight,
ability to :read secrets and foretell events; power t:; cause
diseases, death by lightning and destructive storms; to
transform themselves into beasts and birds ; to bring
about illicit love, barrenness of living beings and crops ;
theiremnity against children and practice ofdevouring them.
Papal bulls appeared for the appointment of Inquisitors,
who must not be interfered with by the civil authorities, and
the Emperor and reigning princes took such under their
protection. The persecutions rose to a ferocity unparal-
lelled in other couutrics. till the following ~entury, and
hundreds were burned in the ~pace of a few years. Two
Inquisitors of this time. Jacob Sprenger, and Henricus
· Institor, compiled the famou~ Mal/Bus Malejicarum, a
complete system of witchcraft, also a perfect method of
proving the innocent capable and guilty of any and every
crime. Yet it was meant partly as an apology- a pointing
out of the necessity for the extermination of such a horde
of evil-doers. At this time, too, appeared the bull of
Pope Innocent VIII., another comprehensive method and
process for trials and tortures.
These persecutions were intermittent throughout the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, breaking out again with
renewed vigour in the seventeenth.century. It was stimu-
lated in this by the increasing strife between Catholics
·Germany 179
and Protestants and the condition of the country, devasta-
ted by wars, plague and famine, was an ever-ready and
fruitful source of charges that might be brought against
sorcery. Two cities, Bamberg and \Viirzbur~t attained a.n
unenviable fame for sanguinary trials and numberof victims.
In the first-named city, Prince-Dishop George II., and
his suffrag.ln, Frederic Forner, prosecuted the holy in-
quisition witb such energy that between the years 1625
and 1630 nine hundred trials tOok place, six hundred people
being burned. Confessions o£ whatever the holy fathers
wished, were wrung from the victims under extreme and
merciless torture. Rich and poor, learned and ignorant.
were gathered into the tc.ils, the number often bdng so
great that n:1mes were never taken and written down, the
prisoners being cited as No. I, 2, 3, and so on.
At Wfirzburg. Lutheranism wa~ gaining ground, and
here again the charge of sorcery was brought against its
followers. The bishop, Philip Adolph, who came to the
see in 1623, did not dare to openly prosecute them, so
took this me~nsof punishing tlrose unfaithful to the Church.
In Hauber's 'Biblioll:eca Magica may be found :-. list o£
twenty-nine burnings, covering a short period prior to
1629. Each burning consisted of several victims, the
numbers ranging from two up to ten or more. It is a
strange procession we see here. winding their way to death
through the flames and bitter smoke, a procession pathetic
and terrible. Old men and women, little girls and boys
and infants, all emissaries of the Evil One; noble ladies
and washerwomen; vicars. canons, singer3 and minstrels ;
Bannach, a senator, " the fMtest citizen in Wurzburg";
a very rich man, a keepe1 of the P<)t-hl>use, the bishop's
own nephew and page, "th'e most beautiful girl in Wiirz-
burg," a huckster, a blind girl, living beings be->ide the
decapitated dead-the procession is enclless as theconditions
were various.
Strangely, it was at Wiirzburg, in 1749, that the last trial
for witchcr<.ft took place, that of Matia Renata, of the
Convent of Unterzell. She was condemned on all the old
charges, of consorting with the Devil, bewitchments and
other infernal practices, and burned there in the mor.th of
June, the last victim of cruel superstition.
Towards the end of the seventeenth century, disbelief
in the trut~ of w:tchcra!t :1nd criticism of the wholesale
burnings began to be heard, though earlier than this, so:ne
had dared to lift their voices against the injustice and
ignorance of it all. Corneliu3 Sans, a priest in Mainz, bad,
before 1593. stated his doubt of the whole proceedings,
but suffered for his temerity. Johannes Wier, physician
to the Duke of Cleves, Thomas Erast, another physician,
Adam Tanner, a Davarian Jesuit, and last, but not least,
Frederick Spree, also a Jesuit, who, more than all helped
to end the reign of terror and superstition.
Alchemy, the forerunner of modern chemistry, belonged
in those days to the realm of magic, and was therefore
Satanic in its derivation, and its followers liable to the
charge of sorceryand the penalty of deatb. In this fratern·
ity we lind emperors and princes, often devoted to the
study themselves, or taking into their service well-known
practisers of the art, as when Joachim I. had Johannes
Trithemius as teacher of astrology and .. defender of
magic," and the Emperor Rudolph employing :Michael
Maier as his physician.
Germany supplies a long roll o£ names famous for their
discoveries made in the name oi magic, men who by their
sea1ch for knowledge and truth laid themselves open to
much terrible suspicion. Here we find Paracelsus,-that
inexplicable figure who in his search !or the Elixir of Life
discovered laudanum, perhaps in some magical distillation
of black poppies at midnight hout ; the great Cornelius
Agrippa; Basil Valentine, prior and chemist; Henry
Germany
Kiihiirath, physician and philosopher, and a train of stu-
dents, all tirelessly se<.rchin;; for the elusive mysteries of
life, the innermost secrets o[ nature.
These men were awesome figures to the igilorant mind.
Popular imagination was ever busy weaving strange tales
about their doing:;, such a-; i nfem ~l dealings and pacts with
the De~l. Such knowledgr) as the alchemists gained could
only be acquired by infernal means, and the soul of the
magician was often the price promised anrl inexorably
demanded by the Evil One. These myths and imaginings
centred themselves about one magician especially, and in
the Faust legend we m'ly find embalmed the general attitude
and belief of the Middle Ages towards learning and any
attempt to extend the rc::\lm of knowledge.
The Alchemists were also mystics as their writings abun-
dantly testify, but most notable of all in tllis department
of occultism was Jacob Bohmc, the son of peasants, the
in:;pired shoemaker.
During the Thirty Years' War many wild preachers,
seers and fanatics appeared, exhorting and prophesying.
No doubt the condition of the country contributed towards
producing these states of hallucination and hysteria, and
in contrast to the terror, mi~>fortune a:td sorrow on all sides
we have accounts of cc:;taticr. absorbed in supernatural
visions. Anna Fte:scher of Freiuurg was such an one, as
was Christiana Poniatowit:.:sch, who journeying throughout
Bohemia and Germany related her visions and prophesied.
At the end of the seventeenth century the old tenets of
magic were undergoing a gr.~dual change. Alchemy began
to separate itself from them, and became merged in the
science of chemistry. The residue of the magical beliefs
formed their prot:~gonists in members of all kinds of ·Secret
societies, many of which were founded on those of the
Jl.liddle Ages. Freemasonry-whose beginnings are at-
tributed by some to a certai:t s;uild of masons banded to-
gether for the building of Strasburg Cathedral, but by other
authorities to Rosicrucianism- !ormed the basis and pat-
tern for mar.v other secret soc:eties.
In the e!gi~teenth centurv these flourished exceedingly.
Occultism becam~ r;:.mp.ll:t. We hear of Frederick
William wor;.ing with Steinert in a house speciaUy built
fo: evoc~tions; of Sch:oep!er, proprietor of a. cafe with his
m:lgic punch and circles for rais.n!( the spirits of the dead;
of L11.vater with tw.) spirits al h:s command; of the Mopses,
a society whos<' rites of initi?.tion were those o£ the Tem-
plars and Witches' Sabi>ath in a mild and civilized form;
and of Carl Sand, the mystical fanatic who killed
Kotzebue.
The Illuminati, who:;e t~aci•ings, spreading to France,
did so much towards bringing abou.t the many violent
changes there. were b;:.nded tl>getber as a society by Adam
Weishaupt and fostered by Baron von Knigge, a student
of occultism. Tne object of this society is said to have
originally been th:~ot of circumventing the Jesuits, but in
its development it absorbed mysticism and supernaturalism,
finally becoming 'political and revolutionary as it applied
its philosophies to civil and religious life. Though it was
disbanded and broken up in 1784 its influence was incal-
culable and widespread in its etfects for long afterwards.
i\iany other names occur, coming under the category of
mysticism: Jiing Stillir.g, seer, prophet and healer; Anton
Mesmer, the dtscoverer and apostle of animal magnetism;
the :?>farqttis de Puysegur, magnetist and spiritualist ;
Madame von Krudener, preachet of peaceandclemency to
monarchs and princes; Zscbokke the mystical seer, and
Dr. Justinus Kerner, believer in magnetism and histori!l'n
·or .tho3e two famous cases of possession and mediumship,
the ·• J\laid of Orlach " and the ·• Seeress of Prevorst."
E;uly in the nineteenth cent~:~ry occurred the re~ar~ble
cures said to be affected b¥ Prmce Hohenlohe, a dtgmtary
Gerson 180 Ghost
of the Church. He was led to believe i.n the power of heal-
ing through the infiuer\ce of a pc 1~:1t named :vhrtin ~fiche!.
:\!ost of these cures took phce at Wurzburg. the scenes of
former sanguinary witch·burnintts. and it is said that up-
wards of four hundred people, de1f, dumb, blind and para-
lytic were cure~ by the power of f~rvent prayer. .. .
About this tlme also occurred the fam~us case of .. stig-
mata" in the pe~son of th:: ecst.ltic, K:~.the:ine Emerick,
the nun of DUimen. The rem'lrka.ble fe:ltures were the
appearance of a. bloody cross encircling the head; mark;
of wounds in hand~. feet and side, and crosses on the b!"east,
with frequent bleedin~s therefrom. This persisted for
many years and the c:~.se i; m;:ntioned by several notable
men of the time.
In nineteenth century Occultism we find, as in the earlier
periods, stories of haunlings and doings of mischievous
sprites existing b::side l(lu,1ecl disquisitions by educated
men ; as that on the ·• fnurlh dimension in space" by
Zollner in his Transce11dc•:Jal Physics, and another on the
luminous emanations from m:~.tcrial objects in B:~.ron von
Reichenbach's treatise on the Od or Ody!ic Fqrce; thus
betraying an unmistako,\ble likeness to its precursor, the
magic of the 711iddle Ages. . . .
Spiritualism. The movement of modern sptntualism,
which left such a cleep impreos o"l America, France and
England, affected Cerma1ty in a much less degree. But
it would be inde1!d surprising if the country which gave so
great attention to m•gnetism, wherein somnam~ules and
clairvoyants were so plentiful, the country of seers and
mystics, did not interest itself it1 the wide-spread phenom-
ena of spiritualism. And investigators there were in Ger-
many, though we have no record of any in the period im-
mediately following the Roche>ter Rappings. Fichte
declared for the facts of sp:ritualism; Hartmann, also,
the author of the Philos<lphy <1{ the Unconsci<l~<S, deiired
to give the phenomena a definite place in philosophy. Carl
du Pre!, in hi~ Philosophy o{ .lfyslicism, points to spiritu-
alistic manifestations as evidence of a subcouscious region
in the human miud. Du Prt!l also founded a monthly
magazine, Tlu Sphime, devoted to the interests of spiritu-
alism, and Aksakoff, lhe well-known Russian spiritualist,
published the results of his rcse.1rches in Germany, and in
the German language, because he was not permitted to
publish them in Ru'lsian. Another philosophic exponent
of the spiritualistic do.:trine was B:uon Hellenbach, who
founded on its tenets a distinct hypothesis of his own-
namely, that no change or world, or ·• sphere," occurs at
birth or death, but merely a ch:1nge in the mode of p<:rcep-
tion. So much for the philosophical attitude towards the
phenomena. The popular view-point was doubtless more
influenced by the perform:1nces of the mediums who from
time to time found their w<~.y to Germany. The most im-
portant of these was Henry Slade, who sought refuge in
that country from his English persecutors. His remarkable
manifestations in GenHa11y, under the observation of Zollner
the astronomer, left nothing to be desired from a spiritu-
alistic point of view.
Gerson, Jean Charlier de : The lelrned and pious chancellor
of the University of Paris, who died in 1429. He was the
author of the ExaminatiQII qj Spirits, which contained r ules
for distinguishing true revelations from false ; and of
Astrology Rcfqrmed, which had a great success.
Gert, Berthomlne de : A sorceress of the town of Prcchac
in Gascogny, who confc~sed about the year t6o8 that when
a sorceress returning from the Sabbath was killed on the
way, the devil was in the habit of taking her shape and
making her reappear and die in ht:r own dwelling so as to
preserve her good reputation. But if he who had killed
her had a wax candle about him, and made with it the sign
of the cross on the body of the witch, the devil could not
with a ll his strength remove her, and so was forced to leave
her there.
Gervais : Archbishop of Rheims, died in 1067. His death
wa!; revealed to a ~orman knight, returning from a pil-
grima~e to Rome, by a hermit whom he met on the way,
and who told him that on the ptevious night he had been
disturbed by a vision of demons making a greJ.t noise.
They had, they said, been carrying the body of Gervais
from Rheims, but because of his good deeds he had been
taken fro:n them. On his return to Rheims the knight
found that Gervais was dead, a nd that the time of his death
corresponded exactly with the time of the hermit's vision.
Ghor-Boud-Des, Tbe : The people of "Ghor-bund-land."
Mr. PI)COCk~ in his India i11 Greece m'Untains th<:.t these
people are the same as the ·• Corybantes.'' or ministers of
the gods, otherwise known as the C.'l.biri.
Ghost Seers : Sir William IIamiliton has observed, " however
astonishing, it is now proven, beyond all rational doubt,
th:~.t in certain ab:~ormal states of the nervous organism,
perceptions arc possible through other than t he ordinary
channels of the senses." But, without entering into this
metaphysical question, folk-lore holds that persons born
at a p.1rticular time of the day h:~.ve the power of seeing
ghosts. ·• Thus it is said in Lanc.\shire," says :.\1r. Thisel-
ton Dyer, " that children born during twilight are supposed
to have this peculiarity, and to know who of t heir acquain-
tance will next die. Some say that this property belongs
also to those who h<tppen to be born exactly at twelve
o'clock at ni~ht, or, as the peasantry say in Somersetshire,
" a child born in chime-hours will have t he power to see
spirits." The s:une belief prevails in Yorkshire, where it
is commonly supposed that children born during the hour
after midnight have the privilege through life of seeing the
spirits of the departed. :.\1r. Henderson says that " a
Yorkshire lady informed him she was very near being thus
distinguished, but the clock had not struck twelve when
she was born. '\"'hcn a child she mentioned this circum-
stance to an old servant, adding that • :\Iamm3. was sure
her birthday was the 23rd, not the 2-Jth, for she had in-
quired at the time.' · Ay, Ay,' s~id the old woman, turn-
ing to the child's nurse, ·mistress would be very anxious
about that, for bairns born after mid-night see more things
than other folk.' "
This superstition prevails on the Continent, and, in
Denm:~.rk, Sunday children have prerogatives far from
enviable. Thorpe, tdls how " in Fyer there was a woman
who W.lS born on a Sunday, and, like other Sunday children
had the f,\culty ofseeing much that wa~ hidden from others.
But, because of this property, sh<l could not p:~.ss by a church
at night without seeing a hearse or a spectre. The gift
became a perfect burden to her; she therefore sought the
advice of a man skilled in such matters, who directed her,
whenever she saw a spectre to sn.y, .. Go to Heaven ! but
when she met a hearse, '' Hang on! " Happening some-
time <tfter to meet a heJ.rSe, she, through lapsu o f memory
cried out, ·• Go to IIe:~.vcn !'" and str.J.ightway the hearse
rose in the air and vanished. AflerwMds, meeting a spectre
she said to it, ·• Hang on I " when the spectre clu ng round
her neck, hung on her back, and drove her down into the
earth before it. For t hree days her shrieks were heard
before the spectre would put an end to her wretched life."
It is a popular article of faith i11 Scotland that those who
are born on Christmas Day or Good Friday have the power
of seeing !ij)irit.~. and even of commanding them, a super-
stition to which Sir \Vatter Scott alludes in his Marmion
(stanza 22). The S!J:llliards imputed the haggard and
downcast looks of their Philip II. to the disagreeable visions
to which this privilege subjected him.
Among uncultured tribes it is supposed that spirits are
visible to some persons and not to others. The " natives"
Gilles 181 Gilles
of the Antilles believed that the dead appe:1red on the road
when one went alone, but not when they went together ;
among the Finns the ghosts of the dead were to be seen by
the Shamans, and not by men generally, unless in dreams.
It is, too, a popular theory with savage races that the soul
appears in dreams to vis't the sleeper, and hence it h:c; been
customary for rude tribes to drink various intoxicating
substances, under the impression tha.t when thrown into
the state of ecstasy they would have pleasing visions. On
t.his account cert:~.in tribes on the Amuon use cert:lin nar-
cotic plants, producing an intoxication lasting twenty-four
hours. During this period they are said to be subject to
extraordin:\ry visions, in the course of which they acquire
information on any subject they may specially require.
For a simil:J.r reason the inhabitants of North Brazil, when
anxious to discover some guilty person. were in the hJ.bit
of administering narcotic drinks to seers, in whose dreams
the criminal m:~.de his appearance. The Californian In-
dians would give children certain intoxicants in order to
gain from the ensuing vision information about their ene-
mies. And the Darien Indians used the seeds of the Datura
sangui11es to produce in children prophetic delirium, during
which they revealed the whereabouts of hidden treasures.
Gilles de Laval : Lord of Raiz, and Marshal of France, the
"Blue Beard" of our nursery legends. and a famous
sorcerer, was born about the ye:~r 1420, of one of the most
famous families of Brittany. His father died when he was
in his twentieth year, and the impetuous lad found himself
possessed of unlimited power and wealth. By birth, he
was connected with the Roceys, the Craons, and the Mont-
moreneys. Throu~h his father's decease he became the
lord of fifteen pnncely dom'\ins, yielding a revenue of
three hundred thousand livres. lie was handsome, lithe,
IVcll-!imbed, but distinguished by the appendage of a
be.1rd of bluish black. His address was fascinating, his
er~dition extensive, his courage unimpe:lChable. Every-
thmg seemed to promise a splendid and illustrious career
instead of that dark and miserable history which ha~
associated the name of Blue Bc:1rd with so many traditions
of horror and legends of atrocious crimes.
At the outset he did nothing to justify an evil augurv.
He served with zeal and gallantry in the wars of Charles vt.
ag~inst the English, and bad fought under Joan of Arc in
the eve~ memorable Siege of _Orleans. His exploits pro-
c~re~ h1m from a grateful king the reward of the high
d1gntty of ~farshal of France. From this point his career
tend~ downw~rds. ~c retired to his Castle of Ch:1.mptoce
and tndulgcd 10 the dtsplay of the most luxurious state.
Two ~undr~d horsemen accompanied him on his travels,
and hts tram. when he went hunting, exceeded in magni-
ficence that of the King himself. His retainers wore the
most_sumptuous ~resses;. his horses were caparisoned with
the nchest. trappmgs ; hts castle gates were thrown open
day and mght to all comers, for whom an ox was daily
roaste~ whole, and sh~cp, a_nd pigs, and poultry, wine, mead.
and luppocras provided m sufficient quantities for five
hundred t>ersons.. He. ca.rried the same love of pomp into
h~s devotiOn. H1s pnnctpal chaplain, whom he called a
bLShop, a de.1n, a chanter, two arch-deacons, four vicars, a
schoolmaster, twelve assistant chaplains, and ei,..ht chori-
sters, composed his ecclesiastical cstablishme~t. Each
of these had his horse and his servant; all were dressed in
robes of scarlet an~ furs, and had costly appointments.
Sacred v~ls, crucdixes. all of gold and silver, were trans-
ported With them wherever their lord went, together with
~any organs, each carried by six men. He was exceed-
mg~y des•rous that all. the priests of his chapel should be
ent1tled to we~r the. IUlt~e.. and he sent many embassies to
Rome to obtatn thts pnvdege, but without success. He
maintained a choir of twenty-five young children of both
sexes, and the3e he c ~u~ed to be tnstructed in singing by
the best m'lsters of th'! day. He had also his comedians,
his morris-d:1ncers, and his jugglers, and every hour was
crowiled with some sensu·\! gratification or voluptuous
pleasure.
In r4+3, this ma~nificent young seigneur wedded Cath-
erine, the heiress of the nobl:: House of Thouars, an event
which afforded him fresh occo~.sions of displaying his insane
p~ion for luxutious pomp. He cave the most splendid
banquets; he figured in the most chivalric tournaments.
His guests, who came from all parts to share in the revels
of Champtoce, knew not which to admire the most, his
slcill in all knightly exercises. or his profound erudition.
" He had espoused a young woman of high birth," says
Eliphas f.evi, " and kept her practically shut up in his
castle at L\Iachecoul, which had a tower with the entrance
walled up." A report was spr~ad by the Marshal that it
was in a ruinous state, and no one sought to penetrate
therein. This, notwithstanding, Madame de Raiz, who
was frequently alone during the dark hours, saw red lights
moving to and fro in this tower; but she did not venture
to question her husband, whose bizarre and sombre char-
acter filled her with extreme terror.
The legal state m:~intained by the Lord of Ret:t was
ordered on so extensive a scale that it even exhausted his
apparently inexhaustible revenues, and to procure the
funds for his pleasures and his extravagance, he was com-
pelled to sell several of hli baronies. Thea the :Marshal
attempted to dispose of his scignory of Ingrande: B~t
his heirs-at-law, indisposed to sec their valuable mben-
tan-ce gradually pared away into nothing, solicited the
interference of the King, and a royal edict prohibited him
from selling his paternal estates. ln this predicament,
most men would have curtailed their profusion, and en-
deavoured to economize their tncomc, but Gilles iU Retz
was unable to live in diminis!1cJ splendour. The luJ..uries
that surrounded him were all that for him made life. To
have shorn him of his magnificence would have been to
st.rike a death-blow at his heart. :\Ioney, thetefore, became
the principal object of his desires, and to obtain money it
seeml'd to his excited imagination only necessary that he
should turn alchemist.
He sent ::.ccordingly 1nto ltaly, Spain, and Germany,
and invited the adepts in the gre;~t science to repair from
1wety land to the splcnduur.;; of Champtoce. Amongst those
who obtained the summonses, and continued attached to
him during the remainder of his career, were Prclati, an
alchemist of Padua, and a physician of Poitou, whose name
is not given. At their instigation he built a stately
laboratory, and joined by other adepts. eagerly began the
search for the Philosophers' Stone. For a twelve month
the furnaces blazed away right merrily, and a thousand
chemical combinations disposed of the Marshal's gold and
silver. Meanwhile, the alchemists feasted on the most
luxurious viands, and quaffed the rarest wines; and so
admirable were their quarters thal, as far as they were
concerned, they would h::I.Ve prosecuted the quest of the
elixir vit<e, or the Philosophers' Stone, until death cut short
their labours.
The impetuosity of the Lord of Retz could not abide
such lingering processes. He Wd.llted wealth, and he
wanted it immediately. If the grand secret could not be
diswvered by any quicker method, he would have none
of it, nor, indeed, as his 1c.;ou:ccs were fast melting away.
would it avail him much if the search occupiedseveral years.
At this junction the Poitousa11 physician and the Paduan
alchemist whispered to him of quicker and bolder methods
of attaining tile desired alkchest. if he had the courage to
adopt them. Gilles lk Ret: im:nediately dismissed the
inferior adepts, and put himself i.n the hands of the two
Gilles 182
abler and subtler masters. These persuaded him that the
Evil One could at once reveal to them ti\e secret, and
offered to. summons him ex tcncbris, for the Marshal to
conclude with him whatever armngement he thought best.
As long as he saved his soul, the Lord of Retz professed
himseH willing to do anythin;; the devil might commarft!..
In this frame of mind he went to the physician at mid-
night to a solitary recess in the neighbouring wood, where
the physician drew the magic circle and made the custom-
ary conjurations. Gilles listened to the invocation with
wonder, and expectant that every moment the Spirit of
Darkness would burst upon the startled silence. After a
lapse of thirty minutes, the physician manifested signs of
the greatest alarm ; his hair seemed to stand on end, his
eyes glared with unutterable horror; he talked wildly,
his knees shook, a deadly pallor overspread hi!!<countenance,
and he sank to the ground. Gilles was a man of dauntless
bravery, and gazed upon the strange scene unmoved.
After awhile the physician pretended to recover conscious-
ness. He arose, and turnmg to his master, inquired if
he had not re:narked the wrathful countenance of the
devil. De Retz replied that he had seen no devil. Where-
upon the physician declared he had appeared in the fashion
of a 'vild leopard, and had growled at him l1orribly. " You,"
he said to his lord, "would have been the same, and heard
the same, but for your want of faith. You could not
determine to give yourself up wholly to his sen;ce, and
therefore he thrust a mist before your eyes." De Retz
ac~nowledged that his resolution h~d somewhat faltered,
but that now his choice was made, if indeed the Evil One
could be coerced into spe:lldng, and rev~ling the secret
of the universal alkahest. The physician said that there
grew certain herbs in Spain and Africa which possessed the
necessary power, and offered t:> go in search of them him-
self if the Lord of Laval would supply the funds. As no
one else would be able to detect the herbs so miraculously
gifted, De Rett thanked ti;e physician for his voluntary
self-denial, and loaded him with all the gold he could sp~re.
Tbe physician then took lc:we Clf his credulous patron, who
never saw him again.
De Retz, as soon as the physici<\n had quitted Champtoce,
was once more seized with the fe,·er of unrest. His days
and ni~bts were consumeu in ceaseless \isions of gold ;
gold, wttl1out which he mu~t ab~ndon his gilded pomp and
unholy pleasures; gold, without which he could not hope
to brave his enemies or prociJre exemption from the just
p:mishment of his crimes. Ile now turned for help to the
alchemist Prelati, who agreed to undertake the enterprise
it De Retz furnished him with the charms and talismans
necessary in so troublesome a work. He was to sign with
his blood a contract that he would obey the devil in all
things, and to offer up a sacrifice of the hands. eyes, blood,
heart and lungs of a young child. The madm::.n having
wilhngly consented to these terms, Prelati went ont alone
on the followin~ night, and after an absence of three hours,
returned to his 1mpatient lord. His talc was a monstrously
extravagant one, but De Ratz swallowed it greedily. The
devil had appeared in the shape of a comely young man of
twenty, who desired to be called Barron, and had pointed
out to him a store of ingots of pure gold, buried under an
oak in the neighbouring wood, which was to become the
property of the Lord of Laval if he fulfilled the conditions
of his contT~ct. But this bright prospect was over-clouded
by the deYil's injunction that tile gold was not to besearched
for until a period of seven times seven weeks had elapsed,
or it would turn to slates and dust. De Retz was by no
means willing to wait so many months fo1 the realisation
of his wishes, and desired Prelati to intimate to the devil
that he should decline :tny further correspondence with
him if matters could not be expedited. PnHati petsuaded
Gilles
him to wait for seven times seven days, and then, the two
tepaired with pick-axe and shovel to dig up the treasure.
After some hard work they lighted upon a load of slates
inscribed with bieroglyphical characters. Prt:lati broke
out into a fit of rage, and culuminated the Evil One as a
liar, a knave, a rogue-De Retz heartily joining iu his fierce
denunciations. He persuaded his master, however, to
give the devil a further trial, and led him on from day to
day with dark oracular hints and pretended demoniac
intimations, until he had obtained nearly all the valuables
remaining to his unhappy dupe. He was then preparing
to escape with hb plunder, \\hen a catastrophe occurred.
which involved him in his lord's ruin.
On Easter Day, in the year 1440, having communicated
solemnly in his chapel, and bade farewell to the lady of
Machecoul, telling her that be was departing to the Holy
Land, the poor creature was even then afraid to question,
so much did she tremble at his presence; she was al.!;o
several months in her pregnancy. The Marshal permitted
her sister to come on a visit as a companion during his
absence. ~Iadame de Raiz took advantage of this indul-
gence, after which C.illc.~ de Laval mounted his horse, and
departed. To her sister, :\ladame de Raiz communicated
her fears and anxieties. What went on in the castle ?
Why was her lord so gloomy ? \Vhat signified his repeated
absences? What beC.'\me of the children who disappeared
day by d<>y ? What were those nocturnal lights in the
walled-up tower ? These and the other problems excited
the c111iosity of both women to the utmost degree. What,
all the same, could be done ? The lllarshal had forbidden
thctn expressly e\·en to approach the tower, and before
lea\'ing he h:td expressed th1s injunction. It must assuredly
have a secret entrance, for which llladame de Raiz and her
sister Anne proceeded to search through the lower rooms
of the castle, corner by corner, stone after stone. At last,
in the chapel, behind the altar, they came upon 2. copper
button, hidden in a mass of sculpture. It yielded under
pressure. a stone slid back, and the two curi0$ity-seckers,
now all in a tremule. distinguished the lowermost steps of
a stairc.1.se, which led them to the condemned tower.
At the top of the f:rst flight there was a kind of chapel,
with a cross upside down and blo.ck cacdles; on the altar
stood a hideous figure, no doubt representing the demon.
On the second floor, they came up011 furnaces, retorts,
alembics, charcoal-in a word, all the app:lratu~ of alchemy.
The third flight led to a dark chamber where the heavy
and fetid atmosphere compelled the young women to
retreat. )Jadame de Raiz came into collision with a vase,
which fell over, and she was conscious thl'.t her robe 2r.d
feet were soaked by some thick and unkno"n liquid. On
returning to the light at the head of the stairs, she found
that she was bathed in blood.
Sister Anne would ha,·e lied from the place. but ic
Madame de l{aiz curiosity was even stronger than disgust
or fear. She descended the stairs, took a lamp from tJ,e
infernal chapel and returned to the third floor, where a
frightfnl spectacle awaited her. Copper vessels filled with
blood were ranged the whole length of the walls, bearing
labels with a date on each, and in tt.e middle of the room
there was a black marble table, on which lay the body of
a child, murdered quite recently. It was one of those
b~sins. which had fallen, and black blood had spread far and
wide over the grimy and worm-eatc:n wooden fioor. The
two women were now half·dead with terror. Madame de
Raiz endcavourell at all costs to efface the evidence of h<:r
indiscretion. She went in search of a sponge and water,
to wash the boards, but she only extended the stain, and
that which at first seemed black, became all scarlet in b\:e.
Suddenly a loud commotion echoed through the castle,
mixed with the cries of people calling to Madame de Raiz.
Gilles 183 Gilles
She distinguished the awe-stricken words: " Here is
:\!onseigncur come back." The two women made for the
staircase, but at the same moment they were aware of the
trampling of steps and the sound of other voices in the
devil's chapel. Sister Anne fied upw:>.r<ls to the bat~lemcnt
of the tower ; 2\ladamc de Ra.iz went down trembling, ?.nd
found ilersel! face to face with her husb~nd, in the act of
ascending, accompanied by the apostate priest and
Pr~lati.
Gilles de Lalla/ seized his wife by the <:.rT:l, ?.r.d without
speaking. dragged her into the iufern:>J chapel. It was
then that Pr~lati observed to the :\lar:;h::.l: " Jt is needs
must, as you see, and the victim has come of her own
accord.... " "Be it so," answered his m~ter. " Begin
the Black :\1ass.... " The apostate pr:est went to the
altar, while Gilles de Lalla/ opened a little cupbo~.rd fixed
therein, and drew out a large knife, after which he s::.t down
close to his spouse, who was now almost in n swoon, and
lying in a heap on a bench againsl the wall. The sanileg-
ious ccrcmoni~ began. It must be cxplai!l()u that the
i\larsho.l, so far from takin~ the road to Jeru~ak·m, had
proceeded only to )rantcs, where Prchti livcci; he attacked
this miserablE' wretch with i11e uttermost furv, ?..r.cl threat-
ened to slay him if he did not fnrnish the means of extracting
from the devil that which he had been demanding for so
long a time. With the object of obtaining delay, Prclati
declared that terrible conditions were required by the
infernal ma~ter, first among which would be the sacrifice of
the ~1arshal's unborn child, after tearing it forcibly from
the mother's womb. Gilles de Laval m:tde no reply, but
returned at once to Machecoul, the Florentine sorcerer
and his accomplice, the priest, being in his train. With
the rest we are acquainted.
2\lcanwhilc, Sister Anne, left to her own devices on the
roof of the tower, ?.nd not daring to come down, had re·
moved her veil, to m::tkc signs of distress at chance. They
were answered by two cavaliers, accompanied by a posse
of armed men, who were riding towards the castle ; they
proved to be her two brothers, who, on learning the spurious
departur.: of the :\larshal for Palestine, had come to visit
and console :\ladame de Haiz. Soon after they arrived
with a clatter in the court of the castle, whereupon Gilles
de Laval suspended the hideous ceremonY, and said to his
wife : ·• :\ladame, I forsive you, and the matter is at an
end between us if you do now as 1 tell you. Heturn to your
apartment, change your garments, and join me in the
guest-room, whither 1 am going to receive your brothers.
But if you say one word, or cause them the slightest sus·
picion, 1 will bring you hither on their deParture; we shall
proceed with the Black ~lass at the poirit where it is now
broken off, and at the consecration you will die. i\Iark
where 1 place this knife.
He rose up and ted his wife to the door of her chamber,
and subsequently received her relations and their suite
saying that this lady was prep:~.ring herSelf to come and
salute her brothers. l\Iadame de Raiz appeared almost
immediately, pale as a spectre. Gilles de I.aval never took
eyes off her, sceki11g to control her by his glance. When
her brother suggested that she was ill, she answered that it
was the fatigue of pregnancy, but added in .an undertone :
" Save me, he seeks to kill me." At the same moment,
Sister Anne ru~hed into the hall, crying: ··Take us away;
save us, my brothers, this man is an assas-;in," and she
pointed to Gilles de Laval. While the :\larshal summoned
llis people, the escort of the two visitors surrounded the
w:omen '~ith drawn sw~rds, .and the i\Iarshal's people
dtsan;ned mstcad of obeytng him. :\Iadame de Raiz, with
her stster and brothers, gained the drawbridge, and left
the castle.
Terrible rumours were now bruited through aJI the
country-side. It was noticed that many young girls and
boys ha.d disappe:\red. Some bad been traced to the
Castle of Champtoce, and not beyond. The public voice
accused him of murder. ano of crimes even worse than
murder--of lust in its foulest and most disgusting shapes.
It was true that no one dared openly accuse a baron so
powerful as the Lord of Rctz. lt was true that whenever
the circumstances of the disappearance of so many children
were alluded to in his presence, he always manifested the
greatest astonishment. But the suspicions of the people
once aroused arc not easily allayed ; and the Castle of
Cbamptoce and its lord soon acquired a fearful reputation,
and were !lurrounded with an appalling mystery.
The continued disappearance of young boys and girls
had caused so bitter a feeling in the neighbourhood that
the Church had felt constrained to intervene, and on the
eamest representations of the Bishop of Nantes, the Duke
of Brittany ordered De Retz and his accomplic'e to be ar-
rested. Their trial took place before a commission com·
posed of the Bishop of Nantes, Chancellor of Brittany,
the Vicar of the Inquisition, and Pierre I'H6pital, the
President of the Provincial Parliament. De Rctz was
accused of sorcery, sodomy, and mmder. At first he
displayed the most consummate .coolness, denounced his
judges :ts worthle~s and impure, and declared that rather
th:~.n plead before such shameless lcnaves he would be
hung like a dog, without trial. Dut the overwhelming
evidence brought against him- the terrible revelations
made by Prclati and his servants of his abandonE>d lust,
of his :mcrificcs of young children for the supposed gratifi·
cation of the devil, and the ferocious ple;~sure with which
he gloated over the throbbing limbs and glazing eyes of
those who were equally the victims of his sensuality and
his cruelty-this horrible talc, as it unfolded day by day
the black record of his enormities, shook even his imper-
turable courage, and he con!cssed everything. The blood·
stained chronicle showed that nearly one hundred children
had fallen victims to this madman and his insane greed of
the Philosophers' Stone. Both De Rctz and PrNati were
doomed to be burned alive, but in consideration of his rank
the punishmeilt of the )Jarshal w:~s somewhat mitigated.
He Wal> strangled before he was given over to the flames.
On the scaffold, he exclaimed to Prclati, with a hideous
assumption of religious confidence : " Farewell, friend
FrancJ.S. In this world we shall never meet again, but let
us rest our hopes in God-we shall see each other in Para-
dise." The sentence was executed at Nantes, on the
23rd of February, 1440. "Notwithstanding his many and
atrocious cruelties," says the old chronicler, 1\Ionstrelet,
"he made a very devout end, foil of penitence, mo:;t humbly
imploring his Creator to have. mercy on his manifold sins
and wickedness. When his body was partly burned,
some ladies and da:nsels of his family requested his remains
of the Duke of Brittany, that they might be interred in
holy ground, which was granted. The greater part of the
nobles of Brittany, more especially those of his kindred,
were in the utmost grief and confusion at his shameful
death."
The Castle of Champtocc still stands in its beautiful
valley, and many a romantic legend flowers about its gray
old WJ.Ils. " The hideous, half-burnt body of the monster
himself," says Trollope, " circled in names, pale, indeed,
and faint in colour, but more lasting than those the hang-
man kindled around !tis mortal form in the meadow under
the walls of Nantes-is seen on bright moonlight nights,
standing now on one topmost point of craggy wall, now on
another, and is beard mingling his moan with the sough
of the night·\vind. Pale, bloodless forms, too, of youthful
growth and mien, the restless, unsepulcbred ghosts of the
unfortun11tes who perished in these dungeons unassoiled,

wards in numerous groups across the space enclosed by
tbe ruined walls, with more than mortal speed, or glancing
hurriedly from window to window of the fabric, as still
seeking to escape from its hateful confinement."
Girard, Jean-Baptiste : A Jesuit born at POle in 1680, much
persecuted by the Janscnists. They accused him of having

at Plymouth, and became a Church of England clergyman
with charges at Frome Sclwood and Strcat and Walton.
In 1666 he was appointed to the Abbey Church, Bath, was
made a prebendary of Worcester Cathedral, and was chap-
lain in ordinary to Charles II. from 1672. In his scepsis
Scie11tifica (1665) his Sorcerers a11d Sorcery (1666) and his
Sadd1teismus Triumphatus (printed 1681) he undertook
the defence of the belief in the supernatural, and supplied
m.my illustrations in support of his theory.

of \yhich one could keep a dog from barking, and open a
lock, and supposed to be of special value to young men
in their courtship dar.;. About twenty yea.rs ago a well-
known character in Skye. named Archibald the Light-
headed, 'oms believed to know this incantation ; but he
repeated it so quickly that no one could understand what
he said. This poor man was insane; but the fear which
dogs had of him was ascribed to his knowledge of the Gla:;
Ghairm. It...ovas believed that this rhyme had some reference
to the safety of the Children of Israel on the night before
the Exodus : " against any of the children of Israel shall
not a dog move his tongue. against man or beast."
Glauber, Johann Rudolph : German medicincr and alchemist,
born at Carlstadt, in 16o3. No authentic records concern-
ing his life appear to exist, although he was a profuse writer
and left many treatises on medicine and alchemy. He
discovered and prepared many medicines of great value
to pharmacy, some of which arc in common use. for example
the familiar preparation known as Glauber's Salts. He
was a firm believer in the Philosophers' Stone and elixir
vit<e. Concerning the former, he states : "Let the be·
nevolent reader take with him my final judgment concerning
the great Stone of the Wise ; let every man believe what he
will and is able to comprehend. Such a work is purely the
gift of God, and cannot be learned by the most acute power
of human mind. if it be not assisted by the benign help of
a Divine Inspiration. And of thls I assure myself that
in the last times, God will raise up some to whom He will
open the Cabinet of Nature's Secrets. that they shall be
able to do wonderful things In the world to His Glory, the
which, I indeed. heartily wish to posterity tbat.they may
enjoy and use to the praise and honour of God."

Gloucester, Eleanor Cobham, Duchess or : Wife of Humphrey
of Clouccster. uncle of Henry VI.. and Lord Protector of
England during the l{ing's minority. Though Humphrey
was very popular in England, he was not without enemies,
and one of the most bitter of these was Henry Beaufort,
Cardinal of \\'inchester, great-uncle to the King. He it
was who brought a chnrge of witchcraft against the Dttchess
of Gloucestel', hoping thus to destroy her husband's power
as the actual head of the realm and heir to the throne in
the event of the King's death. It was supposed that the
D11clzess had first resorted to witchcraft in order to gain the
affections of Humphrey. whose second wife she was. Then,
when she had married him. and the death of the Duke of
Bedford had removed the last barrier but one between her
and a crown. she set about the secret removal of that
barrier, which was, of course. the unfortunate King. To
assist her in her evil designs, she sought the advice of
Margery Jourdain (the Witch of Eye). Roger Bolingbroke,
Thomas Southwel, and John Hume. or Hun. a priest. All
five were accused of summoning evil spirits, and plotting to·
destroy the King. They were also suspected of making a
waxen image. which was slowly melted before a fire, in the-
expectation that as the image was consumed, the life of
the King would also waste away. For the supposed practice
of this common device of witches, they were put upon
trial. The priest, Hun, turned informer. and Bolingbroke,
having abjured his evil works, was called upon to give·
evidence. Margery Jourdain was burned as a witch. and
the Duchess ofGloucester was sentenced to walk through the-
streets of London on three separate occasions bearing a
lighted taper in her band, and attended by the Lord :\layor,
sheriffs, and others. Afterwards, she was banished to the
Isle of Man.
Gnosticism : Under the desi~ation "Gnostics," several
widely-differing sects were 1ncluded. the term, derived
from the Greek, meaning, " to know " in opposition to-
mere theory, and sharing this significance with the words.
" wizard," " witch," which also indicate in their original
meaning: "those who know."
Simultaneously with Christianity, these sects assumed
a definite form, the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire-
being their sphere of operations at first. Their doctrines
were an admixture of Indian, Egyptian, Babylonian, and
Christian creeds. astrology and magic. with much of the
Jewish Kabbala also. From Alexandria, that centre of
mystic learning, much of their distinctive beliefs and
ritual were derived. while it seems certain that to a certain
extent they became affiliated with l'>titbraism (q.v.). to
whose sheltering kindness Occidental Christianity also
owed much. Most of the sects had a priesthood of the
mysteries, and these initiated priests practised magic arts
astrology, incantations, exorcisms. the fashioning of charms.
talismans and amulets, of which many are extant at the
present day. It is said that the Grecian mysteries. the
Eleusinian and Cabiric. for instance. were celebrated by the-
Gnostic sects down to a late date. They were looked upon
as heretics and sorcerers by the Church, and were the
victims of relentless pe1secution. In Persia also they were-
put to death. but some embraced Islamisrn, and trans-
mitted their doctrines to the Dervish sects (q.v.). Mani·
cbeism. a later sect was founded by Manes, who belonged
to the Order of the Magi. and was famous for his skill in..
Gnosticism 185 God
astrology, medlcines and magic. This sect was anathema
to the Church, and its later variants, Paulicians, Cathari,
Albigensis, Lollarcls, and later still the Carbonari, never
failed to arouse the persecuting fervour of the Church.
Apollonius of Tyana (q.v.), a Pagan, was supposed to
have some connection with the Gnostics. The first Gnostic
of eminence was Simon Magus (q.v.) contemporary with the
Christian apostles. The Simonians arc said to have inter-
preted the Creation in Genesis as symbolic of the gestation
of the fretus, the t<'mptation of Eve and the Garden of
Eden having a like charact<'r. The Carpocratians, one of
the Gnostic sects, derived their mysteries and rites from
Isis worship. They used Theurgic incantations, symbols
and signs. The Ophites also adopted Egyptian rites, and,
as their name indicates, these included much of serpent
symbolism, an actual serpent being the central object of
their mysteries. Marcos, disciple of Valentinus, and
founder of the Marcian sect, celebrated Mass 'hith twc
chalices, pouring wine from the larger into a smaller,
and on pronouncing a magical formula, the vessel was
filled with a liqu01 like blood, which swelled up seething.
Other sects practised divination and prophecy by means of
female somnambulcs. Some of the sects became dcgmdec.l
in doctrine and ritual, this often being of an orgia>tic
character.
The Gnostic talismans were mostly engraved on gems,
the colour and traditional qualities of the jewel being part
of its magical efficacy. They used spells and charms
and mystic formul.e, said to •· loose fetters, to cause blind-
ness in one's enemies, to procure dreams, to gain favour,
to encompass any desire whatsoever." In a Greek Gnostic
Papyrus is to be found the following spell of Agathocles,
for producing dreams : " Take a cat, black all over, and
which has been killed; prepare a writing tablet, and write
the following with a solution of myrrh, and the dream
which thou desirest to be sent, and put in the mouth of the
cat. The text to be transcribed runs: ' Keimi, Keimi, I
am the Great One, in whose mouth rests Mommom, Thoth,
Nauumbre, Karilcha, Kcnyro, Paarmiathon, the sacred
Ian ice ieu aeoi, who is above the heaven, Amckheumen,
Neunana, Seunana, Ablanatbanalba.' (here follow further
names, then,) •Put thyself in connection with N.N. in this
matter (as to the substance of the drt>am named,) but if
it is necessary then bring for me N.N. hither by thy power;
lord of the whole world, fiery god, put thyseU in connexion
with N.N.' Again, there follows a list of meaningless
names, the formula ending : • Hear me, for I shall speak
the great name, Thoth 1 whom each god honours. and each
demon fears, by whose command every messenger performs
his mission. Thy name answers to the seven (vowels)
a, e, e, i, o, u, o. iauoeta6 otttJ8 6ia. I named thy glorious
name, the name for all needs. Put thyself in connection
with N.N., Hidden One, God, with respect to this name,
which Apollobex also used." The repetition of apparently
meaningless syllables was always held to be of great
efficacy in magical rites, either as holding the secret name
of the powers invoked, or of actual power in themselves.
In Atanasi's Magic Papyrus, Spell VII., directs you to lay
the link of a chain upon a leaden plate, and having traced
its outline, to write thereon, round the circumference, the
common Gnostic legend in Greek characters (reading both·
ways) continuously. Within the circle was written the
nature of the thing which it was desired to prevent. The
operation was called " The Ring of Hermes." The link
was then to be folded up on the leaden plate, and thrown
into the grave of one dead before his time, or else into a
disused well. After the formula above given, was to
follow in Greek : .. Prevent thou such and such a person
from doing such and such a thing "-a proof that the long
string of epithets all referred to the same power. These
instances might be multiplied, although much of the more
valuable parts of the Gnnstic doctrines were destroyed by
every persecutor who arose, and this was easily done, for
the s~cre<l; and mysti~ teachings, the praye:s and spells
were mscnbed on penshable parchments. That much of
the. evil was i~puted to them by the Church because of
thCU' more plulosophic habit of thought in opposition to
faith and dogma, is beyond doubt.
Goat : The devil is frequently represented under the shape
of a goot, and as such presided over the witches' Sabbath.
The goat is also the " emblt'm of sinful men at the day of
judgment." (See Baphomet; Witehcraft)
Goblin : A spirit formerly supposed to lurk in houses. They
were generally of a mischievous and grotesque type. Hob-
goblins, according to Junius, were so called because they
were wont to hop on one leg.
G~d : According to the ancient magical conception of Goa
In the scheme of the universe, evil is the inevitable contrast
and complement of goo<l. God permits the existence of
t.he shadow iri order that it may .intensify the purity of the
hght. Indeed he has created both and they arc inseparable·
the one being necessary to and incomprehensible without
the other.
The very idea of goodness loses its meaning if considered
apart from that of evil- Gabriel is a foil to Satan and Satan
to Gabriel. The dual nature of tbe spiritual world pene-
trates into every department of life material and spiritual.
It is typified in light and darkness, cold and heat, truth
and error, in brief, the names of any two opposing forces
will serve to illustrate the great primary law of nature-
viz. the continual conflict between the positive or good
and the negative or evil.
For a scriptural illustration of this point, let the story
of Cain and Abel be taken. The moral superiority of his
brother is at first irksome to Cain, finally intolerable. He
murders Abel, thus bringing on his own head the wrath of
God and the self-punishment of the murdere~. For in
killing Abel he has done himself no good, but harm. He
has not done away with Abel's superiority, but has added
to himself a burden of guilt that can be expiated only by
much suffeting.
Suffering is shewn in the Scriptures to be the only means-
by which evil is overcome by good. Cain re-appears in
the story of the prodigal son, who after privation and suffer-
ing is restored to his father who forgives him fully and
freely.
The possibility of sin and error is therefore entirely con-
sistent with and even inseparable from life, and the great
sinner a more vital being than the colourless character,
because having greater capacity for evil he has alsa greater
capacity for good, and in proportion to his faults so will
his virtues be when he turns to God. "There is more joy
in heaven over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety
and 1\ine just persons.'' because more force of character,
more power for good or evil is displayed by the sinner than
by the feebly correct. And that power is the most precious-
thing in life.
This great dual law, right and wrong, two antagonistic
forces, call them what we will, is designated by the term
duad. It is the secret of life and the revelation of that
secret means death. This secret is embodied in the myth
of the Tree of Knowledge in Genesis. At death the discord
will be 1esolvcd, but not till then.
From the duad is derived the triad on which is based
the doctrine of the 'I'rinity. Two forces producing equili-
brium, the secret of nature, are designated by the duad,
and these Three, call them life, good, evil, constitute one
law. By adding the conception of unity to that of the triad
we arrive at the tetrad, the perfect number of four, tl::e
Godfrey 186
source of all numerical combinations. According to the-
ology there arc three per3ons in God, and these three form
one Deity. Three and one make four because unity is-
required to explain the Three. Hence, in almost all lang-
uages, the name of Cod consists of four letters. Again,
two affirmations make two ne~ations either possible or
necessary. According to the l<abalists the name of the
Evil one consisted of the same four letters spelled back-
W.lrd, signifying that evil is merely the reflection or shadow
of good-" The last reflection or imperfect mirage of light
in shadow."
All which exists in light or darkness, good or evil, exists
through the tetrad. The triad or trinity, then, is explained
by the duad and resolved by the tetrad.
Godfrey : A priest or Provence, who had seduced several wo-
men. One of them, a nun, to save herself, asserted that
Godfrey had bewitched her.
Arr~sted and imprisoned, he was tortured until he con-
fessed that he was a magician, and that he had, by means
of his brclthing and other encha:1tments, corrupted this
woman aad several others. He was even induced, in his
extreme agony, to speak of his presence at the Witches'
Sabbath, and to give ~. long description of it. After these
conicssions had been cruelly extorted from the anguish of
failing nature, the Parliament of Ah: condemned him, on
the 3oth of April, 16I I, to be burnt alive, as g<~ilty of magic,
sorcery, 'impiety, and abominable lust-a sentence which
was c.uried into execution without delay.
This horrible affair gave rise to an ad,·enture which has
been related by tile Abbe of Papon.
·'The process," s~.id he, "contained many depositions
upon the pow~r of the demons. Seven.! witnesses pro-
tested that after being anointed with a magic oil, Godfrey
transported himself to the Sabbath, and afterwards re-
turned to his chamber down the shaft ol the chimney. One
day, when these depositions had been read to the Parlia-
ment, and the imagmation of the judges excited by a long
recital of supernatural events, there was heard in the chim-
ney an extraordinary noise, which suddenly terminated
with the apparition of a tall black man. The judges
thought it was the devil come to the rescue of his disciple,
and fled aw;~y swiftly, with the exception of a counc.illor
Thorton, their reporter, who, finding himself entangled
in his desk, could not follow them. Terrified by what he
saw, with trembling body and staring eyes, and repeatedly
making the sign of the cross, he in his turn affrighted the
pretended demon, who was at a lo3s to understand the
magistr~te's perturbatioa. Recovering from the embar-
rassment he'made himself known, and proved to be a chim-
ney sweeper who, after having swept the chimney of the
::'.lessieurs des Comptes, whose chimneys joined those of
the Tournelle, had by mistake descended into the chamber
of the Parliament."
Goethe, Johann Wolfgang: German Author, (17-19·1832):
joha1m Woljga11g Goethe, probably the most celebrated of
all German writers, w.1s born at Frankfurt-on-the-Main
in 1749, his father being a lawyer of some eminence. At
an early age the boy showed a persistent fondness for draw-
ing, and assimilated the rudiments of learning with sur-
prising ease; while. in 1759. on a French nobleman of
;esthetic tastes coming to stay with the Goethes, a warm
friendship between him and the future author sprang up,
and proved the means of accelerating the latter's intellectual
devcl<?pment. Shortly after this a French theatre was
founded at Frankfurt, and here young Goethe became
conversant with Racine ; while simultaneously he made
some early attempts at original '\'riting, and began to leam
Italian. Latin and Greek, English and even Hebrew. Very
soon, however, a little cloud came to darken his horizon-
just the cloud which has dimmed the blue skies for so
Goethe
many youths-for at the age of fifteen he became des-
perately enamoured of a youn~t girl, and as his parents
disapproved of the match the pair were separated straight-
way. At first Goethe declared himself broken-hearted,
and being intensely virile, as all men of might arc, he sought
consolation in loose-living. But a broken heart seldom
proves a fatal malady, and the disap!'lointed lover's restora-
tion to meutal health was facWtated betimes by his removal
from his native town to Leipsic, where he entered the uni-
versity, intending to become a lawyer.
At Leipsic Goethe showed slender affection for the actual
curriculum, and instead he continued in essay writing and
drawing, while he even took lessons in etching. He also
found time for another love-affair, but this was cut short
in I76S by his undergoing a se1·ious illness; and, on his
r:::coveria;::- therefrom. he decided to leave his present alma
IIJ:lter in favour of that of Strasburg. Arrived there, he
became intimate with Jung StilFng, while his taste for letters
was strengthened, Homer and Ossian being the masters for
whom he chiefly avowed affection ; while, though he con-
tinued to show himself callous as regards law, he succeeded
in becoming an advocate in I771, whereupon he returned
to Frankfurt.
Goethe had already written a quantity of verse and prose,
and now, in his native town, he began to do critiqnes for
some of the new3p;1pers there, while simultaneously he
commenced writing Co~tz VOil Bcrlichi11t:en and Werther.
These were followed shortly by Prometheus, and in I 774
the author started working at Faust, while the following
year witnessed the production of some of his best love
poems, these being addressed to Lilli Schonemann, daugh-
ter of a Frankfurt banker. Nothing more th:m poetry,
however, was destined to result from this new devotion ;
and scarcely bad it come and gone ere Goethe's whole life
was changed, for meanwhile his writings had become fa-
mous, and now the young Duke Carl August of Weimar,
anxious for a trusty henchman, invited the rising author
to come to bis court. The invitation was accepted, Goethe
became a member of the privy-council, while subsequently
he was raised to the rank of Geheimrath and then ennobled.
Goethe's life at Weim:u was a very busy one. Trusted
implicitly by the Duke, he directed public roads and build-
ings, he attended to military and academic affairs, and
he founded a court t!leatre. But though having all these
outlets for his energy he continued to write voluminously,
am•Jng the most important works he produced during his
first year3 at the Duke's court l>eing !phigenia and Wilhelm
.l1eister; while in I787 he made a lengthy stay in Italy,
visiting ~aples, Pompei, Rome and :llilan. Returning
to Weimlr, he began writing Egmo11t; while in I795 he
m~de the acquaintance of Schiller, with whom he speedily
became very intimate, and along with whom he worked
on the Haren, a journal designed to elevate the literary
ta3tes of the m:~.sscs. About this period, too, Coetlle wrote
his play of Herm:u11: und Dorothea, and likewise did sundry
translations from Voltaire, Diderot and Benvenuto Cellini;
while the year I8o6 is a si~nificant one in his history,
marked as it is alike by his marriage and by the entry of
Napoleon into Weimar. The conquering general and tbe
Germ<Ln poet each foun<.t much in the other to admire, and
the latter was decorated with the crOS3 of the Legion of
Honour; nor did his literary activities show any signs of
fta"'ging as r.et, for in t8£I be wrote Dichtung u,.d Wahrll<!it,
in °I82I Wtlheim .lfeister's Wanderjahre, and a little later
be commenced working at a second part of Faust, During
the time he was engaged thus he had two famous visitors,
Beethoven coming from Vienna and Thackeray from
London ; and. though the composer imagined himself
coldly received, the novelist on the contrary spoke with
enthusiasm of the welcome accorded him. But Goethe was
Goetia 187 Grail
now well-stricken in years, his health was beginning to
fail, and he died early in 1832.
Few great writers, not even Disraeli or Sir \Valter Scott,
had fuller lives than Goethe. His love-affairs, besides
those cited above, were countless, and his early taste for
the graphic arts continued to the end 9£ his days, resulting
in his making a vast collection of treasures ; while his
interest in mysticism, by virtue of which he is included in
this volume, manifested itself in divers forms besides the
writing of Faust. For, something of a nympholept as he
was, Goethe's mind was essentially an aspirational and
speculative one, and during his childhood at Frankfurt
he used to do symbolical drawings of the soul's aspirations
to the deity, while subsequently he became immersed in
the study of the Christian religion. Anon he grew sceptical
on this subject, his ideas beinj! altered not only by his own
ruminations but by his readmgs in various inconoclastic
philosophers, especially Rousseau ; and it would seem
that latterly his intellect was less engaged by Christianity
than by those other and probably more ancient Eastern
faiths, his leanings in this direction being demonstrated by
sundry works from his pen, notably his West·ostliche Divatz.
One of his note·books, moreover, shows that while a young
man at Strassburg he made a close study of Giordano
Bruno and other early scientists ; while as a boy he was
a keen student of alchemy, reading deeply in Welling and
van Helmont, Basil Valentine and Paracelsus, and even
fitting up a laboratory where l1e spent long hours in arduous
experiments. No doubt it was while engaged in this way
that be first conceived the idea of writing a drama on the
subject of Dr. Faustus, but be that as it may, his alchemis·
tic and other scientific researches certainly stood him in
good stead when ultimat~ly composing this work. The
story's main outlines are so well known already-not only
by reason of Calderon's and ~iarlowe's versions, but by the
operas of Gounod, Schumann and Berlioz-that it were
superfluous if not impertinent to offer anything of the
nature of a paraphrase or synopsis here; but it should
be said, in drawing to a conclusion, that after all it is
mainly on account of Faust that Goethe takes rank as a
mystic, and a great mystic, for his rendering of the immor-
tal theme is acknowledged as among the finest things in
the whole of mystical literature.
Goetla : (See Key of Solomon the Klog.)
Golden Key : Under this title have been published many
volumes purporting to reveal an infallible method of
attaining success in a lottery. La Clef d'or, or La Veritable
tresor de la fortune, reprinted from time to time at Lille, is
based on the doctrine of sympathetic numbers, which the
author claim!> to have discovered. Each number drawn,
be declares, has five sympathetic numbers which directly
follow it. Thus the number 4 has for its sympathetic
numbers 30, 40, 50, 20, and 76. Knowing this, of course,
it is an easy matter to win fortune at a lottery.
Gormogons: A Jacobite Masonic Society, perhaps related to
the Lodges of Harodim (q.v.) They employed pseudonyms
like the latter, and had an ambassador at Rome. Their
history is sketched in a pamphlet dated 1724, entitled
•· Two Letters to a Friend," and in the work of Prichard
(1730). The Duke of Wharton and the Chevalier Ramsay
who were well-known Jacobites, were members of the
Order. They had a cipher z.nd secret reception of their
own, and used a jargon in which the names of places and
individuals were hidden and transposed. A plate of
Hogarth's is extant in which the Order is lampooned under
the title of .. The ~Iystcry of ~Iasonry brought to light by
ye Gorrno~ons."
Graal, The Lost Book of the : The orig:n of the Graallegend,
which is of course speculative. Seven ancient books are
cited as being the possible cradle of the story, but none of
them q~ite meet the case. In the Ruth Merlin, a "Book
of the Sanctuary " is referred to, but this is a book of
records, not containing any special spiritual allusion.
If, and it is very doubtful if, such a book ever existed,
it wa.o; most probably a Mass book, extant about 1 xoo.
Its contents would relate to a Mass following the Last
Supper, in ·Nhich Christ gave Himself, the Priest serving
The mystery is threefold. (I) of Origin, which is part ot
the mystery of the Incarnation. (2) of Manifestation,
which would have taken place had the world been worthy.
(3) of Removal; this world being unworthy, the Graal
was said to be removed, yet not hidden, for it is always
discernible by anyone worthy, or qualified to see it. As
has been said, it is not probable that such a Mass-book ever
existed.
Grail, Holy : A portion of the Arthurian cycle of romanc~. of
late origin embodying a number of tales dealing with the
search for a certain vessel of great sanctity, called the
"grail" or" graal." Vetsions of the story are numerous-
the most celebrated of them being the Conte del Graal, the
Grand St. Graal, Sir Percyvalle, Quete del St. Graal, and
Guyot; but there are many others. These overlap in
many respects, but the standard form of the story may
perhaps be found in the Grand St. Graal-one of the latest
versions, which dates from the thirteenth century. It
tells how Joseph of Arimathea employed a dish used at the
last supper to catch the blood of the Redeemer which
fiowed from his body before his burial. The wanderings
of Joseph are then described. He leads a band to Britain,
where he is cast into prison, but is delivered by Evelach or
Moidrains, who is instructed by Christ to assist him. This
:Mordrains builds a monastery where the Grail is housed.
Brons, Joseph's brother-in-law, has a son Alain, who is
appointed guardian of the Grail; and this Alain having
caught a great fish, with which he feeds the entire house·
hold, is callffi the Rich ;Fisher, which title becomes that of
the Gf'ail keepers in perpetuity. Alain placed the Grail
in the castle of Corbenic, and thence in due time come
various knights of King Arthur's court in quest of the holy
vessel, but only the purest of the pure can approach its
vicinity; and in due time Percival attains to sight of the
marvel.
It is probable that the Grail idea was originated by early
media:val legends ofthe quest for talismans which conferred
great i.>oons upon the finder; as for example, the Shoes of
Swiftness, the Cloak of Invisibility, the Ring of Gyges,
and so forth ; and that these stories were interpreted in
the light and spirit of me<lireval Christianity and mysticism.
They may be divided into two classes : those which are
connected with the quest for certain talismans, of which
the Grail is only one, and which deal with the personality
of the hero who achieved tl1e quest ; and second!}• those
which deal with the nature and history of the talismans.
A great deal of controversy has raged arour.d the probable
Eastern origin of the Grail Legend, and much erudition
has been employed to show that Guyot, a Proven~al poet
who flourished in the middle of the twelfth century, found
at Toledo in Spain an Arabian book by an astrologer,
Flegitanis, which contained the Gt-ail story. But the
name " Flegitanis " can by no means be an Arabian
proper name; and it might perhaps be the Persian feleke-
ddneh, a Persian combined word which signifies" astrology,"
and in this case it would be the title of an astrological work.
Professor Bergmann and others believed that the Holy
Legend originated in the mind of Guyot himself; but this
conclusion was strongly combated by the late Alfred Nutt.
There is however, good reason to believe that the story
may ha~e been brought from the East by the Knights
Templar.
The Grail Legend has often been held by certain writers
Grail 188 Graterakes
to buttress the theory that the Church of Eng1and or the
Catholic Church hJ.S existed since the found;~.tion of the
w.Jrld. From e:Lrly Christian times the genealogy of these
churches is traced b.lc!( through the patriarchs to numerous
apocryphal parsons; but we are not informed as to whether
it posse.ss<:d hieropbants in neolithic and paleolithic times,
or how it originated. This mischievous and absurd theory,
wlJ.i.ch in reality would identify Christianity with the
grossest forms of paganism, is luckily confined to a small
b.1nd of pseudo-mystics, comprising for the most part
persons of sm.1U erudition and less liberality of outlook.
The Grail Legend was readily embraced by those persons,
who sa\V in it a link between Palestine aud England and a
plea for the special and separate foundation of the Anglican
Church by direct emiMaries from the Holy L:1nd. Glaston-
bury was fixed as the headquarters of the Grail immi-
grants, and the finding of a glass dish in the vicinity of the
cathedral there not many years ago was held to be con-
firmation of tile story by many of the faithful. The
exact da.t~ of this vessel cannot successfully be gallge<l,
but there IS not the least reason to suppo$e that it is more
than a few hundred years old. {See Tradition.)
Grail Sword : A.~sociated with the Holv Grail in Arthurian
Legend. Its history begins with King David who be-
queathed it to Solomon who wa<> bidden to re-cast the
pommel. In Solomon's time it was placed in a ship built
and luxuriously furnished by Solomon's wife. Subse-
quently discovered by the Knights of the Quest, it was
assumed and worn by Galahad.
Gram : A m:1gic sword thrust into a tree by Odin and pulled
out by Sigmund. It bestowed upon its possessor excep-
tional powers and performed many miracles.
Grand Copt : (See Cagllostro.)
Grand Grlmoire, The : A work pretended to be edited by a
suppositious person, Antonia del Rabina, who, it is alleged
prepared his edition from a copy tran11cribed fr.orn th~
genuine writings of King Solomon. The work is divided
into two parts : the first containing the evocation of
Lucifuge Rocofale {See "Ceremonial Magic " in article
"Magic") ; the second being concerned with the rite of
malong pacts 'vith demons. The work is regarded as one
of the most atrocious of its type ; but there is little reason
for such heavy conl\emnation, as its childi~h and absurd.
character must be patent to everyone. Eliphas Levi says
that it pretends to confer the Powder of Protection, that
great mystery of the sages, but that in reality it confers the
Powder of Consecution-whatever that may imply. The
first portion of the Grand Grimoire in a process for the
e~ocation of evil spirits to assist the operator to discover
h1dden treasure. The second part, that which deals
with facts, suggests the surrender of the magician body
ancl soul to the demon, and it is in this that the diabolical
excellencies of the work consist. But the pact, as it
stands, is grossly unfair to the devil, for the working of it is
such, that the magician can very readily slip through his
fingers.
Grand Lodge : Foundation of. (See Freemasonry.)
Grandier, Urbain : Urbai11 Gra11dier, a canon of the French
church, and a popular preacher of the town of Loudun in
the district of Poiriers, was in the year 1634 brought to
trial upon the accusation of magic. The first cause of his
being thus called in question was the envy of his rival
preachers, whose fame W:\S eclipsed by his superior talents.
The secon<l cause was a libel falsely imputed to him upon
cardinal Richelieu. Gra11dier. besides his eloquence, was
distinguished for his courage and resolution, for the grace-
fulness of his figure, and the extraordinary attention he
piad to the ne:\tness of his dress and the decoration of his
person, .which l~st circumstance brought upon him the
Imputation of bemg so much devoted to the service of the
hir. About this time certain nnns of the convent of
Ursulines at Loudun (q.v.) were attacked with i\ disease
which manifested itself by very extraordinary symptoms,
suggesting to many the ideJ. that they were possessed with
devils. A rumour was immediately spread that Gra~tdiu,
urged by some offence he had conceived ag:linst these
nuns, was the author, by the skill he had in the arts of
sorcery, of these possessions. It unfortunately happened
thd.t the same capuchin friar who assured cardinal Richelieu
that Gra11d~r was the writer of the libel against him, also
communicated to him the story of the possessed nuns, and
the suspicion which had fallen on the prieston their account.
The cardinal, seized with avidity on this occasion of private
vengeance, wrote to the counsellor of state at Loudun, t<>
cause a strict investigation to be made into the charges,
and in such terms as plainly implied that what he aimed
at W3.S the destruction of Gra11dier. The trial took place
in the month of August, I6J<t ; and, according to the
authorised copy of the trial, Gra11dier was convicted upon
the evidence of Astarotb, a devil of the order of Seraphims,
and chief of the possessing devils, of Easas, of Celsus. of
Acaos, of Cedon, of Asmodcus of the order of thrones, of
Alex, of Zabulon, of Naphthatim, of Cham, of Uriel, and of
Achas of the order of principalities, and sentenced to be
burned alive. In other words, he was convicted upon the
evidence of twelve nuns, who, being asked who they were,
gave in these names, and professed to be devils that, com-
pelled by the order of the court, delivered a constrained tes-
timony. The sentence was accordingly executed, and
Gra11dier met his fate with heroic constancy. At his
death an enormous drone fly was seen buzzing about his
head, and a monk, who was present at the execution,
attested that, whereas the devils are accustomed to present
themselves in the article of death to tempt men to deny
God their Saviour, this was 13celzcbub (which in Hebrew
signifies the God of flies), come to c:~.rry away to hell the
soul of the victim.
Graterakes, Valentine : An Irish mesmerist born in the
county of \Vaterford in r628. In 1662, he dreamed that
he had received the gift of healing by laying on of hands.
He ignored the dream. but ~s it occ•ured. ag~in on .several
occasions, he made an expenment upon h1s w1fe wh•ch was
quite successful. He practised the laying on of hands for
practically all diseases, and in r666 went to London where
he was summoned to court. \Vhilst there he healed many
persons, but the insults of the courtiers pro,·ed too much
for him and he was forced to withdraw to a house near
London, where be continued his cures. In his Critical
HistoYy of Animal Mag11etism Pechlin says, '·Amongst the
most astonishing cures which history records, are those ot
an Irish gentleman in London, Oxford, and other cities of
England and Ireland. He himself published in London in
r666 a full account of them. · Val. Graterakes, Esq., of
Waterford, in the kingdom of Ireland, famous for curing
several diseases and distempers by the stroak of his hand
only : London, r66o.' "
Pcchlin believes that no doubt whatever can be enter-
tained of the reality of his cures, as they arc related in his
own work : and they are, therefore worthy of being trans-
lated into all lr.nguages. Pccblin caused a number of
letters and tc.>stimonials to be printed, which place the
veracity and the character of Gralerakes in the cle~rest
Uaht. In the first place. j oh. Glanville, the author of
S~psis Scielltifica, in wbich he treated all learning and
human science as open to doubt, and who was also a
chaplain to Charles I I., ~ays in a letter that Gratlrakes w!ls
a simple, amiable, and p1ous man, a stranger to all dece•t-
The same testimony was given to him by George Rust,
Bishop of Dromorc in Ireland. The bishop says that he
was three weeks at his house, where he had an opportunity
·craterakes 189
of observing bis sound morals, and the great number of his
cures of the sick. Through the simple laying on of bands
he dro,•e the pains to the extremities of the limbs. Many
times the effect was very rapid and as if by magic. If
the pains did not immediately give way, be repeated his
rubbings, and always drove tbem from the nobler parts to
the less noble, and finally into the limbs.
The Bishop relates still further :-" I can as eye-
witness assert that Gratuakes cured dizziness, very bad
diseases of the eyes and ears, old ulcers, goitre, epilepsy,
glandular swellings, scirrhouq indurations, and cancerous
swellings. I have seen swellings disperse in five days
whjcb were many years old, but I do not believe by super-
natural means; nor did his practice exhibit anything
sacred. The cure was sometimes very protracted, and the
diseases only gave way through repeated exertions; some
altogether resisted his endeavours."
It appeared to the bishop that something healing,
something balsamic flowed from bim. Graterakes himself
was persuaded that his power was an especial gift of God.
He healed even epidemic complaints by bis touch, and on
that account be believed it hiS duty to devote himseli to
the cure of diseases.
To the bishop's may be added the testimonies of two
physicians, Faireldow and Astel, who very assiduously
inquired into the reality of his cures.
·· I was struck," says Faireklow, "with his gentleness
and kindnnss to the unhappy, and by the effects which be
produced by his hand."
Astel says,-" I saw Graterakes in a moment remove
most violent pains merely by his hand. I saw him drive
a pain from the shoulder to the feet. If the pains in the
head or the intestines remained fixed, the endeavour to
remove them was frequently followed by the most dreadful
crises, which even seemed to bring the patient's life into
danger; but by degrees they disappeared into the limbs,
and then altogether. I saw a scrofulous child of twelve
years with such swellings that it could not move, and be
dissipated merely with his hand the greatest part of them.
One of the largest, however, he opened, and so healed it
with his spittle." Finally Astel says that he saw a number
of other cures, and repeats the testimonies of Rust and
Faireklow 0!'1 the character of Gra14rakes.
The celebrated Robert Boyle, President of the Royal
Society of London, sa~ :-" l\lany physicians, noblemen,
clergymen, etc., testify to the truth of Graterakes' cures,
which he published in London. The chief diseases which
he cured were blindness, deafness, paralysis, dropsy, ulcers,
swelling'>, and all kinds of fevers." Finally, it is said that
' he laid his hand on the part affected, and so moved the
disease downward.s."
Graterakes was undoubtedly one of tbe most celebrated
of the early mesmerists, and there is no question that the
science owed considerable popularity to his cures. There
was nothing of the charlatan about him, and he appears
as an unaffected and simple person, whose whole desire
was to make the best of the gift which he had received.

Greece: That magic in its widest sense was native to the
imagination and genius of the Greeks is apparent in their
theogony and mythology, essentially magical in conception
and meaning, in their literature, sculpture and history.
The natural features ot the country appealed powerfully
to the quality of their imagination. Mountains and
valleys, mysterious caves and fissures, vapours and springs
of volcanic origin; groves,-these according to their
character, were dedicated to the gods. Parnassus was the
abode of the sun-god. Apollo; the lovely vale of Aphaca
that of Adonis; the oak-groves of Dodona favoured of
Greece
Zeus. the gloomy caves with their roar of subterranean
waters the Oracle of Trophonius. Innumerable instance.<>
of ma~cal wondcr-worldng are found in the stories of their
deities and heroes. The power of transformation is shown
in a multitude of c~ses, amongst them those of Bacchus
who, by waving a spear, could change the oars of a ship
into serpents, the masts into heavy-clustered vines, tigers,
lynxes and panthers to appear amidst the waves, and the
terrified sailors leaping overboard to take the shape of
dolphins; in those wrought by Circe who by her magic
wand and enchanted philtre turned her lovers into swine.
The serpent-staff of Hermes gave, by its touch, life or
death, sleep or waldng ; Medusa's head turned its beholders
into stone ; Hermes gave Perseus wings that he might fly
and Pluto a helmet which conferred invisibility. Prome-
theus moulds a man of clay and to give it life steals celestial
fire from heaven ; Od~scus to peer into the future descends
to Hades in search of Tiresins the Soothsayer ; Achilles is
made invulnerable by the waters of the Styx.
Dedicated by immemorial belief there were places where
the visible spirits of the dead might be evoked, Hcraclea,
Acheron, piaces where men in curiosity, in longin~ or
remorse strove to call back for a fleeting moment those
who had passed beyond mortal ken. In the month of
March, when the spring blossoms broke through the earth
and ~nowed the trees with white, the Festiv;\1 of the
Flowers was held at Athens, also the Commemoration of
the Dead, when their spirits were thought to rise from
their graves and wander about the familiar streets, striving
to enter the dwellings of man and temples of the gods but
shut out therefrom by the magic of branches of whitethorn,
or by knotted ropes and pitch.
Oracles: Of great antiquity and eminently of Greekcharac-
ter and mcamng were the Oracles. For centurit>.s they
ministered to that longingdeeplyimplanted in human nature
the lon~ng to know the future, and to invoke divine
fore.c;ight and aid in the direction of human affairs, from
those of a private citizen to the multitudinous needs of a.
great state. Divination and prophecy were therefore the
great features of the oracles. This was inspired by various
means, by intoxicating fumes natural or artificial, by tbe
drinking of mineral springs, by signs and tokens, by dreams.
The most famous Oracles were those at Delphi, Dodona, Epi-
daurus, and that of Trophonius, but others of renown \\'ere
scattered over the country. Perhaps one of the earliest was
that ofAescstlapitts son of Apollo, and called the Healer, the
Dream-sender because his healing was given through the
medium of dreams that came upon the applicant while
sleeping in the temple-courts, the famous temple-sleep.
This temple, situated at Epidaurus, was surrounded by
sacred groves and whole companies of sick persons lingered
there in search of lost health and cnlightment through
divine dreams. Famous beyond all was that of Apollo,
the Delphian oracle on the Southern Slopes of Parnassus
where kings and princes, heroes and slaves of all countries
journeyed to ask the questions as to the future and what
it might hold for them. The temple was built above a
volcanic chasm, amid a wildness of nature which suggested
the presence of the unseen powers. Here the priestess,
the Pythia, so named after the serpent Pytho whom Apollo
slew. was seated on a tripod placed above the gaseous
vapours rising from the chasm. Intoxicated to a state of
frenzy. her mouth foaming, wild torrents of words fell
from her lips, and these were shaped into coherence and
meaning by the attendant priests and given to the waiting
questioner standing before the altar crowned with laurel,
the symbol of sleep and dreams and sacred to Apollo.
Priests and priestesses were also crowned with these
leaves, and they were burned as incense; before the
Pythias chamber hung a falling screen of laurel branches
Greeee 190
while at the festival of the Septerion every ninth year a
bower of laurel \Vas erected in the forecourt of the temple.
One writer has left strange details such as the rule t~at the
sacred fire within the temple must only be fed Wlth fir-
wood ; and, though a 'voman was chosen as the medium of
the prophetic utterance yet no woman might question the
oracle. The Oracle Bj the Pelasgic Zeus at Dodona, the
oldest of all, answered by signs rather than inspired speech,
the rustling of the leaves in the sacred groves, by means of
lots and the falling of water, by the wind-moved clanging
of br.lzen-bowls, two hollow columns standing side by
side. The three priestesses, Peliades, meaning doves,
were given titles ~ignifying the Diviner o~ tlle future ; the
friend of man, Virtue: the virgin-ruler of man, Chastity.
For two tllousanu years this oracle existed. from the time
when it was consulted by those heroes of the ancient myths,
struggling in the toils of Fate, Hercules, Achilles, Ulysses
and Aeneas. down to the latest vestiges of Greek national-
ity. The Oracle of Tropltonius was also of great renown.
Here there were numerous caverns filled with misty vapours
and troubled by the noise of hidden waters far beneath.
In this mysterious gloom the supplicants slept sometimes
for nights and days, coming forth in a somnambulic state
from which they were aroused and questioned. by the
attendant priests. Frightful visions were gP-nerally re-
counted accompanied by a terrible melancholy, so that it
passed iilto a proverb regarding a sorrowful man " He has
been in the cave of Trophonius." Thus it may be seen
that magic in the sense of secret revelations, mimculous
cures and prophetic gifts, of abnormal powers, had always
existed for the Greeks, the oracles were a purely natuml
human way of communing with their gods upon earth.
But magic in the lower sense of sorcery was unknown till
Asiatic and Egyptian infiuences were introduced. The
native conception of Fate as inexorable and inescapable for
gods, kings and slaves alike was inimical to the spontaneous
growth of a form of magic which had for its primaTy aim a
certain command of the' dcstinities of man. Good and
evil and the perpetual strife between these two principles,
the belief in demonology, these were foreign to-the Greek
mind, they were imported. It is said that to the Pytha-
gorean school may be traced the first mention of good and
evil demons and not till after the Persian \Var was theTe a
word in the Greek language for magic. As these foreign
beliefs were thus gradually introduced and assimilated
tiley were ascribed to the native deities, gradually becoming
incorporated with the ancient histories and rites.
After the invasion by the Persians, Thessaly, where their
stay was of lengthy duration, became famous for its sorcer·
esses and their pri\ctices which embTaced a wide tban-
maturgical field, from calling down the moon to brewing
magical herbs for love or death, so much so that Apuleius
in his romance, Tlte Goldm Ass, says, that when in Tbessaly
he was in the place " where, by common report of the
world, sorcery and enchantments were most frequent.
I viewed the situation of the place in which I was, nor was
there anything I saw that I believed to be the same thing
which it appeared to be. Insomuch that the very stones
in the street I thought were men bewitched and turned into
that figure, and the birds I heard chirping, the trees with-
out the walls, and the running waters, were changed from
human creatures into the appearances they were. I
persuaded myself that the statues and buildings could
move ; that the oxen and other brute beasts could speak
and tell strange tidings : that I should hear and see oracles
from heaven conveyed in the beams~£ the Sun."
Sorceresses.-Homer tells the tale of Circe the enchant-
ress, with her magic philtres and magic songs but m'\kes no
mention of Medea, the arch-sorceress of later times. Round
her name the later beliefs clustered, to her were attributed
Greeee
all the evil arts, she became the wit.c!t par excellence, her
infamy increasing from age to age. The same may be said
of Hecate, the moon-goddess, at first sharer with Zeus of
the heavenly powers, but later become an ominous shape
of gloom, ruler and lover of the night and darkness, of the
world of phantoms and ghouls. Like the Furies she
wielded the whip and cord ; she was followed by hell
hounds, by writhing serpents, by lami:c, stryg<eand empus<e,
figures of terror and loathing. She presider\ over the dark
mysteries of birth and death ; she was \Vorsbipped at
night in the Bare o( torches: She was the three-headed
Hecate of the cross-roads where little round cakes or a
lizard mask set about with c:;.ndles were offered to her in
propitiation, that none of the phantom mob might eros<;
the threshold of man. Love-magic and d~alh-tnagic, the
usual forms of sorcery became common iu Gt-eece as else-
where.. Love philtres and charms were eagerly sought. the
most innocent being bitten apples and enchanted garlands.
:\leans of protection against the evil eye became a necessity
for tales of bewitchment were spread abroad, and of mis-
fortune and death peing brought upon the innocent and
unwary by means of a waxen figure moulded in their
image and tortured by the sorceress. In tombs and
secret places leaden tablet'! were buried inscribed with the
names of foes and victims, pierced through with a nail in
order to bring disaster and death upon them. At this
time it became law that none who practised sorcery might
participate in the Eleusinian :Vlystcries, and at Athens. a
Samian Sorceress, Theoris. was cast to the flames.
Orphic M agic.-The introduction of Egyptian influences
were due generally to the ag&ncy of Orpheusand Pytba~oras,
who, while in Egypt, had been initiated into the mysteries.
The story of Ot"pheus shows him as pre-eminently the
wonder-worker, but one of beneficence and beauty. To
men of his time everything was enchantment and prodigy.
By the irresistible power of his music he constrained the
rocks, trees and animals to follow him, at his behest storms
arose or abated. He was the necromancer, who by his
golden music O\'ercame the powers of dar:mess. and de3cend-
ing to the world of shades, found his beloved Eurydil:e,
and but fo:- the fatal and disobedient look into her faceere
they gained the upper a.ir would have brought her back to
the living world. Jealous women tore hir:1 limb from
limb, and his bead floating down the waters of the Hebrus
was cast on the rocky shores of Lesbos where, still ret:l.ining
the power ofspeech,it uttered oracles, tllc guidance of which
people from all parts sought, even those of Babylon. He
was said to have instructed the Greeks in medicine and
magic, and for long afterwards remedies, magical formul<e,
incantations and charms were engraved upon Orphean
tablets and the power of healing was ascribed to the Orphean
Hymns. Pythagoras, Philosopher and geometrician, to the
populace a m'lgician, indefatigable in the pursuit of know-
ledge, wielded an immense influence on the thought of his
time. After his return from Egypt be founded a school
where to those who had previously undergone severe and
drastic discipline he communicated his wide and varied
knowledge. He was also credited with miraculous powers
such as bein~ visible at the same hour in places far apart as
Italy and S1cily ; of taming a bear by whispering in its
ear; of calling an eagle from its flight to alight on his
wrist.
Mysteries.-Among the greatest features of. religious life
were the mysteries held at periodic intervals in connection
with the different deities, such as the SamothracMn, the
Bacchicand most famous ofall, the Eleusiniail. Their origin
i~ to be traced mostly to a pre-historic nature-worship and
vegetation-magic. All these mysteries bad three trials or
baptisms by water, fire and air, and three specially sacred
emblems, the phallus, egg and serpent, generative emblems
· Greeee 191 Greece
sacred in all secret rites. The Samothracian centred
round four mysterious deities, Axieros the mother. her
children Axiocersos, male, Axiocersa, female, from whom
sprang Casindos the originator of the universe. The
festival probably symbolizeli the creation -of the world,
also the harvest and it<> growth. Connected with this was
the worship of Cybele, goddess of the earth, of the citiel.
and fields. Her priests, the Corybantes, dwelt in a cave
where they held their ceremonies, including a wild and
orgiastic weapon-dance, accompanied by the incessant
shaking of heads and clanging of swords upon shields.
The cult of Bacch~ts was said by some to have been carried
into Greece from EgY.{lt by Melampus. He is the god of
the vine and vegetation, and his mysteries typified the
growth of the vine and the vintage; the winter !!leep of all
plant life and its renewal in spring. Women were his chief
attendants, the Bacchantes,who, clashing cymbalsand utter-
ing wild cries in invocation of their god, became possessed
by ungovernable fury and homicidal mania. Greatest
of all in their relation to Hellenic life were the Eleusinian
Mysteries. These were the paramountmterestand function
of the state religion exPorting the widest, &trongest in-
fluence on people of all classes. The rites were secret and
their detailsare practically unknown, but they undoubtedly
svmbolised che myth of Demeter, corn-goddess, and were
tield in spring and Septt>mber. Prior to initiation a long
period of purification and·preparation was enforced. dun ng
which the higher meaning of the myth was inculcated, the
original meaning having become exalted by the genius of the
Greeks into an intimate allegory of the soul of man, its
birth, life and death, its descent into Hades and subsequent
release therefrom. After this there came the central point
of the mysteries, the viewing of certain holy ami secretsym-
bols ; next, a crowning with garlands, signifying the happi-
ness which arises from friendship with the divine. The
festival also embodied a scenic representation of the Story
of Demeter; the rape of Persephone, the sorrow of the
mother, her complaints before Zeus, the final reconciliation.
Women played a great part in this, the reason being that as
they themselves ·•produce," so by sympathetic m~gic
theti influence was conveyed to the corn, as when crying
aloud for rain they looked upward to the skies, then down
to the earth with cries of '· Conceive! " These priestesses
were crowned with poppies and corn, symbolical attributes
of the deity they implored. (See article Mysteries.)
Divinaticm.-Besidcs the priestsand priestessesattached to
the different temples there was an order of men callro
int~rpreters whose business ~t was to read futurity by
vanous means such as the 01ght of b1
rds and entrails of
victims. These men often accompanied the armies in
order to predict the success or failure of operations during
warfare and thus avert the possibility of mistakes in the
campaign: they fomented or repressed revolutions in
state and government by their predictions. The most
celebrated interpreters were those of Ells, where in two or
tbree families this peculiar gift or knowledge was handed
down from father to son for generations. But there were
others who were authorised by the state-men who traded
on the credulity of the rich and poor, women of the lowest
dregs of humanity, who professed to read the future in
natural and unnatural phenomena, in eclipses, in thunder,
in dre:1ms, in unexpected sight of certain animals, in con-
vulsive movement of eyelids, tingling of the ears, in sneez-
ing, in a few words casually dropped by a passer-by. In
the literatuYe and philosophies of Gnece magic in all its
forms is found as theme for imagination, discussion and
belief. In the bands of the tragic poets, sorceresses such
as Circe and MedC.l. become figures oi terror and death,
embodiments of evil. Pythagoras left no writings but on
his theories were founded those of Empedocles and Plato.
In the verses of Empedocles he teaches the theory of re·
incarnation, he himself remembering previous existences
wherein he was a boy, a girl, a plant, fish and bird. He
also claimed to teach the secrets -of miraculous medicine,
of th~ re-animation of old age, of bringing rain, storm, or
sunshine, of recalling the dead. Aristidcs the Greek
orator gives exhaustive accounts of the many dreams he
experienced during sleep in the temples and the cures
prescribed therein. Socrates tells of his attendant spirit
or ~eoius who warned him, and others through his agency,
of 1mpendinj; danger, also foretelling futurity.
Xenophon, treating of divination by dreams, maintains
that in sleep the human soul reveals her divine nature, and
being freed from trammels of the body gazes into futurity.
Plato, while invei~hing against sorcery, took the popular
superstitions relating to magic, demons and spirits and by
his genius purified and raised them, usin~ them as a basis
for a spiritual and magical theory of things, unsurpasS('d
for intellectual beauty. On his teaching was founded the
school of Neo-Platonists who were among the most fervid
defenders of-magic. Aristotle states that prediction is a
purely natural quality of the imagination, while Plutarch
m his writings, wherem much may be found on magic and
dreams, gives an exhaustive account or the somnambulic
states of the oracular priestess, Pythia, attributing them to
possession by the divinity. K.N.
Greece Modern : Although superstition is rife in the
Hellenic archipelago it partakes more o! the nature of
Slavonic tradition than that of the ancient inhabitants of
the country, and is more or less petty and ill-defined. But
the most notable circumstance in modern Greek superstition
is that which relates to Vampirism. The Vampire is called
BYoucolack by the modern Hellenes, and appears to date
from mediocval times. Says Calmet, "It is asserted by
the modern Greeks, in defence of their schism, and as a
proof that the gift of miracl~s. and theepiscopal power of the
keys, subsists in their church more visibly and evidently
than in the church of Rome, that, with them, the bodies
of excommunicated persons never rot, but swell up to an
uncommon size, and are stretched like drums, nor ever
corrupt or fall to dust, till they have received absolution
from some bishop or priest. And they produce many
illStanccs of carcasses which have been in their graves
uncorrupted, and which have afterwards putrefied as soon
as the excommunication was t~ken off."
" They do not, however, dcmy tbat a body'snot corruptmg
is sometimes a proof of sanctity, but in this case they
expect it to send forth an agreeable smell, to be white or
ruddy, and not black, stinking, and swelled like a drum, as
the bodies of excommunicated persons generally are. We
are told, that in the time of Manuel, or Maximus, patriarch
of Constantinople, the Turkish emperor having the mind
to know the truth of the Greek notion concerning the
incorruption of excommunicated bodies, the patriarch
ordered the grave of a woman, who had lived in a criminal
commerce with an archbishop of Constantinople, to be
opened. Her body bein~ found entire, black and much
swelled, the Turks put it 1nto a chest, under the emperor's
seal, and the patriarch having repeated a prayer, and given
absolution to the deceased, the chest was opened three days
after and the body was found reduced to ashes. It is also
a notion which prevails among the Greeks, tbat the bodies
of these excommunicated persons frequently appear to the
living, both day and night, and speak to them, call upon
them, and disturb them several other ways.
"Leo Allatius is very particular upon this head, and says,
that in the isle of Chio, the inhabitants never ans,'l'cr the
first time they are called, for fear of its being a spectre;
but if they are called twice, they arc sure it i-; not a Bronco-
lack (this is the name they give these spirits). If any one
Greece 192
appears at the first call, the spectre disappears, but the
person certainly dies.
"They have no way to get rid of these evil genii. but to
dig up the body of the person that bas appeared, and burn
it after having repeated over it certain prayers. By this
means the body being' reduced to ashes, appears no more.
And they look upon it as a clear case, that either these
mischievous and spiteful carcasses come out of their graves
of their own accord, and occasion the death of the persons
thatseeorspeakto them ; or that the devil himself makes use
of these bodies to frighten and destroy mankind. They
have hitherto discovered no remedy which more infallibly
rids them of these plagues. than to burn or mangle the
bodies which were made use of for these cursed purposes.
Sometimes the end is answered by tearing out the heart
and letting the bodie3 rot above ground before they burn
them again, or by cutting off the! bead, or driving a large
nail through the temples.
Sir Paul Rycaut, in hill History of the Present State of the
Gr11ek Church, observes, that the opinion that, excommuni-
cated bodies are preserved from putrefaction, prevails,
generally, not only among the Greeks, but also amonl; the
Turks, and he gives us a fact which he bad from a Caloyer
of Candia, who confirmed it to him upon oath. The
caloyer's name wa.~ Sopbronius, a man well known and
respected in Smyrna.
There died in the island of Milo, a man, who was ex:com-
municated for a fault which be had committed in the
Morea, and he was buried in a private place. without any
ceremonies, and in unconsecrated ~round. His relations
and friends expressed great dissatisfaction at his being
treated in this manner, and very soon after the inhabitants
of the island were tormented every night by frightful
apparitions, which they attributed to this unhappy man.
Upon opening the grave his body was found entire, and his
veins sweUed with blood, :~nd a consultation being held
upon the subject, the caloyers dismembering his body.
cutting it in pieces, and boiling it in wine, which, it seems,
is the usual manner of proceeding there in those cases.
However, the friends of the deceased prevailed upon
them, by dint of ~ntreaty, to delay the execution, and in
the meantime sent to Constantinople to get absolution for
him from the patriarch. Till the mes.o;enger could return
the body was laid in the church. and prayers and masses
were said daily for the repose of his soul. One day while
Sopbronius the caloyer above mentioned, was performing
the service, there was heard on a sudden a great noise in
the coffin, and upon ex:amination the body was -fouud
reduced to ash<'S, as ifit had been dead seven years. Partic-
ular notice was taken of the time when the noise was heard,
and it was lound to be the ver)[ morning when the absolu-
tion was signed by the patriarch. Sir Paul Rycaut, who
has recorded this event, was neither a Greek nor Roman
Catholic, but a staunch Protestant of the Church of
England.
He observes upon this occasion, that the notion among
the Greeks is, that an evil spirit enters into theexcommuni-
cated carcass and preserves it from corruption by perform-
ing the usual functions of the human soul in a living body.
They fancy, moreover, that these corpses eat by night, and
actually digest and are nourished by their food; that
several have been found of a fresh, ruddy colour, with their
veins ready to burst with blood, full forty days after their
death. and that upon being opened there has issued from
them as large a quantity of warm fresh blood as would
come from a youn9 person of the most sanguine constitu·
tion. And this op1ru0n prevails so universaily, that every
one is furnished with a story to this purpose. Father
Tbeophilus Raynard, author of a particular treatise upon
this subject, asserts that this corning again of deceased
Greeeo
persons is an undoubted truth, and supported by unquest-
ionable facts. But to pretend that these spectres are
always excommunicated persons, and that the schismatical
Church of Greeu bas a privilege of preserving from putre-
faction the bodies of those that die under her sentence, is
what cannot be maintained, since it is certain that excom-
municated bodies rot as well as others, and that several
who have died in the communion of the church. Greek as
well as Roman, have continued uncorrupted. There have
even been instances of this nature among the heathens, and
frequently among other animals. whose carcasses have been
found unputrefied in the ground, and among the ruins of
old buildings. Whoever will examine more accurately
into this matter, mav consult father Goard's Rilr1el des
Grecs, p. 687, 688. i:Iatthew Paris's History of England,
t. ii. p. 687. Adam of Bremen, c. ixx:v. Albert of Stade,
under the year 1050 ; and M. Ducange, Glossar. Latinit, at
the word " Imblocatus."
M. De Tournefort bas given, in his travels. an account of
the digging up an imaginary Broucolack in the island of
Mycone, where he was on the ISt of January, 1701. His
words are as follow:-" \Ve were present at a very differ-
ent scene in the same island, upon occasion of one of those
dead corpses. which they suppose to come to life again
after their burial. The man, whose story I am going to
relate, was a peasant in Mycone, naturally ill-natured and
quarrelsome (a circumstance of consequence in such
cases) ; he was murdered in the fields. nobody knew how,
or by whom.
"Two days lifter his being buried in a chapel in the town
it was noised about that he was seen in the night walking
about in a great burry; that he came into houses and
tumbled about their goods, griped people behind, and
played a thousand little monkey tricks. At first it was
only laughed at, but it soon grew to be a very serious
affair when the better sort of people joined in the com-
plaint. The Papas them9elve!l gave credit to it, and no
doubt had their reasons for so doing. Masses, to be sure,
we said, but the peasant was incorrigible, and continued
his old trade. After several meetings of the chief people
of the town, and of the priests and monks, it was concluded
to be necessary, in obedience to some old ceremonial, to
wait till nine days after the burial.
" On the tenth day, a mas.'l was said in the chapel where
the body lay, in order to drive out the devil, which was
imagined to have taken pos;;ession of it. \Vhen the mass
was over the body was taken up. and preparations were
made for pulling out its heart. The butcher of the town,
an old clumsy fellow, began with opening the belly instead
of the breast. He groped a long while among tile entrails
without finding what he looked for, till at last somebody
said he should cut up the diaphragm, and then the heart
was pulled out, to the adrni.ration of the spectators. In
the meantime the carcasJ; stunk ~o abominably that they
were obliged to burn frankincense but the smoke mixing
with the fumes of the corpse, increased the stink and began
to heat the poor people's brains. Their imagination,
already affected with the spectacle before them, grew full
of whimsies, and they took it into their heads that a thick
smoke came- from the body; nor d11rst we say that it was
only the smoke of the incense.
·• In the chapel and the square before it they were
incessantly bawling out Broucolack. which is the name
they give to these pretended rcdivivi. From hence the
bellowing was communicated to the streets and seemed to
be invented on purpose to split the roof of the chapel.
Several there present averred that the blood of the offender
\vas red, and the butcher swore that the body was still
warm, whence they concluded that the deceased -was
guilty of a heavy crime for not being thoroughly dead, or
Greece 193 Gregory
rather for suffering him~elf to be re-animated by the
devil, which is the notion they have of a Broucob.ck.
'fhey then roared out th1t word in a stupendous manner.
Just at this time there came in a ftocl;; of people, who
loudly protested that they plainly saw the body \\las not
grown stiff \Vhen it was carried from the fields to the church
to be buried, and that consequently it was a true Brouco·
lack, which word continued to be the burden of the song.
" I question not but they would have sworn it did not
stink if we hJ.d not been th(:re so thoroughly \Y'ere their
h~nds turned upon this occasion, and so strongly were they
infatuated with the notion of these spectres. As for us,
\ve got as close to the body as we could, th~t we might
observe what p1sscd more exactly, and werealmost poisoned
'~ith the stink. When they asked us what we thought of
the corpse we told them we believed it to be completely
dead, and having a mind lo cure, or, ;:.t least, not to exa.s-
perate their prejudices, we presented to them that it was
no wonder the butchershould feel some warmth, by grop!ng
in the entrails, which were then putrefying, that it wa':!
no extraordinary thing for it to emit fumes sinca the same
will happen upon turning up a dunghill, and that as for t he
pretended redness of the blood, it was still visible by the
butcher's hands, that it was a mere stinking n:>sty smear.
" After all our reasoning they resolved upon going to
the sea·shore, and there burning the dead man's heart.
But, notwithstanding this execution, he did not grow
more peaceable, but made more noise tha11 ever. He was
accused of beating people in the night, breaking down
doors, and even roofs of houses, shattering windows
tearing clothes, and emptying casks and bottles'. It wa5 ~
ghost of a very thrifty constitution ; nor do I believe that
he spared' any house but the consul's, where we lodged. In
the meantime nothing could be more deplorable than the
condition of this isl:!.nd. ~ot a head in it but was turned ;
the wisest among them were seized ltke the rest. In sho1t,
it was a real disorder of the brain, as d:\ngcrous as lunacy
or mad ness. Whole families quitted their· houses, and
brought their beds from the remotest parts of the town
into the great square, there to spend the night. Every
one complained of so:ne fresh insult, and !lothing could be
h:;a.rd but groans at the approach oi mght. The most
semible people among them thought proper to retire into
the country.
·· \Vhen the preposscsion wa~ so general, we thought it
our best way to hold our tongues. Had we opposed it we
should have been treated not only as fools, but a~ infidels.
Indeed, how was it possible to bring a whole nl\tion to its
senses ? Tho'le who believed in their hearts that we
d oubted the truth of the fact, ca.:ne and reproached us with
our incredulity, and endeavoured to prove that there were
such things as Broucolacks, by quotations out of the
B:~e.lder of Faith, written by father Richard, a Jesuit
missionary. Their argument was this : He was a Latin,
and therefore you ought to believe him, nor should we
have got anything by denying the consequence. We
wece entertained every morning with a recital of the new
pranks of this night-bird, who was even charged with
being guilty of the most abominable sins.
" Soma of the citizens, who were most zealous for the
public good, took it int.o their heads that there had been a
defect in the most es~ential part of the ceremony. T hey
were o( opinion th'l.t m'l.ss ought not to have been said, till
after the he"rt Iud been pulled out. With this precaution
t!ley insisted that the devil must :1e~ls have been worsted,
and would .not have ventured to come again; wherea~.
by m:1» be10g s1id first, he hl d time e:1.ough given him to
;na.ke off, and return to hi'! post wh:!n the d;!.nger wa~ over.
.. Af~r all the>e w:~e rc!lcetions, they were as much
perple:ot~d a~ at n.·3t setting out. They meet ni3ht and
morning, debate, and make processions for three days and
three nights. The Papas are obliged to fast, and run from
house to house with sprinklers on their hands. Holy
·water is plentifully scati.ered about, even to the washing of
the doors, and filling the mouth of the poor Broucolack.
"\Ve repeated it so often to the magistrates, that we
should not fail in Christendom to appoint a watch by
night upon such an occasion, in order to observe what
p::.'ised in tb.e town, that at last they apprehended some
vagabonds who bad certainly a hand in these disorders;
but either they were not the principal agents, or they were
d ismissed too soon. For two days after, to make them-
selves amends for the fast they had kept in prison, they
begun to e:npty the wine casks of such as had been silly
enough to leave their houses in the night, so that nothing
Wd.S left but to have recourse again lo prayers.
" One day, as they were repeating a certain form, after
h:~.ving stuck a number of naked swords in the grave where
the c:trcass lay (which they dug up three or four times a
day to gratify the whim of whoever came by), an AJbanian,
who happened to be at Mycone, took upon him to pro·
nounce with an air of great wisdom, that it was ndiculous
to make use of the swords of Christi?.ns in such a case as
this. " A:re you so blind," says he, " as not to see tbat
the hilt of these swords, being m!>.de in the form of a cross,
hinders the devil from coming out of the carcass ? I am
surprised that you do not take the T urkish sabres." But
t he expedient of this wise personage had no effect : the
Broucolack was still unruly ; the whole island contiaued
in a strange consternation, and they were utterly at a
loss what s::oint to invoke, when all of a sudden, as if they
bad given one another the word, they begun to bawl all
over the city that they had waited too long, that the
Broucolack should be burned to ashes, and then they
defied the devil to harbour there any longer, and that it
was better to have recourse to thi& extremity, than to
have the island totally deserted. For, in fact, several
whole families had begun to pack up in order to retire to
Syra or Tinos.
" The magistrates, therefore, gave orders to carry the
Broucolack to the point of St. George's Island, where they
got ready a great pile, with pitch and tar, for fear the wood
should not burn fast enough of itself. Theremnantofthis
miserable carcass was thrown into it and soon consumed.
It was the rst of January, 1701, and we saw the flarne as
we returned from Delos. It might properly be called a
rejoicing bonfire, as no more complaints were heard of the
Broueolack. T iley only said that the rlcvil had at last
met with his match, and some ballads were made to turn
him into ridicule.
" It is a notion which prevalls all over the Archipelago
that the devil re-animates no carcasses but those of the
Greek communion. The inhabitants of Santorini are
terribly afraid of these bug-bears: those of Mycone, after
their whims were dissipated, were equally afraid of a prose-
cution from the Turks, and from the bishop of Tinos.
Not a single Papas would venture to be at St. George's
when the body was burnt, for fear the bishop should insist
upon a fee for their taking up and burning a body without
his leave. As for the Turks, they did not fail, a t their
next visit, to make the .Myconians pay heavily for their
treatment of this poor devil, who became in every respect
an object of abomination and horror to all the country."

Gregory the Seventh : A pope of the eleventh century,
against whom a charge of necromancy was brought. He
is chiefly notable for his bitter and prolonged struggle with
Grihestha 194 Grossetete
Henry IV., Emperor of Germany. A quarrel arose between
them regarding the gift by Henry of ecclesiastical dignities,
to account for which he was summoned before Gregory.
He refused to appear, was excommunicated, and, in
return, bad the pope kidnapped by brigands. GregMy,
however, was rescued by the people of Rome, and on his
release commanded the Germans to elect a new emperor,
Rudolph, duke of Suabia. Henry, attended by a very
small retinue, thereupon repaired to Canossa, where
Gregory at that time resided, to arrange for terms of pe~ce.
He was there treated with such severity and studie<l
neglect that his desire to come to terms with the pope left
him, and on his return he elected an anti-pope, Clement
III. In the struggle which ensued Henry defeated
Rudolph in battle and GYegoYy was sentenced as a sorcerer.
He died in exile at Salerno.
As a magician he is not very conspicuous, for his fame
rests chiefly on a prophecy he made publicly that Rudolph
would be victorious, and that " before St. Peter's day,"
on the fulfilment of which saying be staked his papal
crown Tbe unfortunate Rudolph. entirely trusting to
Gregory's oracular utterance, renewed the battle six times
and finally perished without having obtained the promised
victory. Other stories credit Gregory with the power of
making lightning v:ith a motion of his hand, and causing
thunder to dart from his sleeve. It is related by Benno
that on one occasion he left his magical book behind him at
his villa. Entrusting two of his servants with the task of
returning for it, he warned them not to look into it on pain
of the most awful punishment. However, curiosity over-
came the fears of one of them, and, opening the book he
pronounced some words. Immediately a band of imps
appeared and asked what wa.c; their command. The
terrified servants begged that the demons would cast down
so much of the city wall as lay in their way, and thus they
escaped the penalty of their disobedience.
Of a lofty and severe ca~t of mind, Gregory's rrtotlve
was not so much fraud as profound enthusiasm and
strength of purpose. which sustained him through the
strug!(le with Henry to the end of his life.
Grlhestha : (See India.)
Grlmolre : A text-book of Black :\Iagic. The three best
known grimoires are the Grimori"m Vemm, the Grand
GrimoiYe, and the Grimoire of Pope Honorius. Black
magic (q.v.) is of course an ignorant and superstitious
perversion of the true science, and the grimoires well
illustrate this-their most noticeable feature being their
utter futility. The J!'rimoires, in fact, cannot be taken
seriously, and the diabolic practices contained in their
pages are more absurd than fearsome. Before entcrin"
upon them, the rites of the church are practised a'> a pn~
liminary and fasting is observed. The great object of the
grimoiYes is to invoke the infernal po\vers, and at the s:J.me
time to trick them. The ftends are tr¢?.ted as imbeciles.
In tbe grimoire, the magician is instructed how, when
selling them his soul, he may deceive them by a play upon
words. One of the clue£ desires of the sorcerer of the
middle ages was to discover hidden treasure by means of
Satanic agency, and having found it to devote himself to
good deeds and the distribution of his wealth among the
poor.
Abstinence from every species of impurity is strongly
insisted upon for the space of an entire quarter of the
moon, and the sorcerer most solemnly promises the
grand Adonai (q.v.), the :\laster of all Spirits, that he shall
not eat more than two meals per diem, and that these
shall be prefaced by prayer. The operator must change
his apparel as seldo;n as possible, and sleep only on occasion,
meditating continually on his undertaking, and eentring
all his hopes in the infinite goodness of Adonai, who is
undoubtedly the supreme dei~y. and not as might be
thought a master-fiend. But the grimoires teem with
mystifications, and it is frequently difficult to discern their
real meaning. In the three grimoires alluded to, the
infernal hierarchy is described at length-(See Demon-
ology) ; but the principal contents of these works are
evocations and spells for the gaining over of the diabolical
po,vers to the purposes of the sorcerer. That they were
employed by veritable professors of the art of black magic
is rather unlikely, as the real black magician had very
much higher aims than the mere unearthing of buried
treasure, and it is most probable that they were for the
most part in usc among amateurs of the art, who dabbled
in it merely in the hope of enriching themselves.
Grlmolre of Honorlus, The : A magical work published at
Rome in r6z9, and not, as is generally thought, cqnnected
in any way with Kabbalistic magic. The work ·is inrleed
permeated " ith Christian ideas. It is extremely unlikely
that it is the work of the Roman Bishop known as Honorius.
The work has been called " a malicious and somewhat
clever imposture," since it pretends to convey the sanction
of the Papal Chair to the operators of necromancy. [t
de?.ls with the evocation of the rebellious angels.
Grlmorium Verum, The : This magical text-book was first
published in I.St7, and purported to be translated from the
Hebrew. It is based to some extent upon the Key of
Solomon (q.v.), and is quite honest in its statement that it
proposes to invoke "devils," which it refers to the four
elements, so that these would appear to be of the type of
elementary spirits (q.v.). A part of the account it gives
regarding the hi.crarchy ofspirits i3 taken from the Le:nege-
ton (q.v.). The work is divided into three portions: the first
describing the characters and se:1ls of the demons, \nth the
forms of their evocation and dismissal ; the second gives a
dsecription of the supernatural secrets which can be
learned by the power of the demons : and the third is the
key of the work and its proper application. But these
divisions only outline what it purports to place before the
reader, as the whole work is a mass of confusion. The
plates which supply the characters do not apply to the
text. The book really consists of two parts-the GYimQrium
Verum itzelf, and a second portion, which consists of
magical secret.;. Tile first supplies directions for the
preparation of the ma!(ician based on those of the Clavicle
of Solomon. Instructions for the manuhcturc of ma~cal
instrum'::nts, and the composition of a parchment on which
tbe charoicters and seals arc to be inscribed, as well as the
proc~jcs of evocation and dismissal. The second part
contains the " admirable secrets " of the pretended
Albertus ~Iagnus, the •· Petit Albert" and so forth. The
work is only partially diabolical in character, and some of
its process"s mi~tht claim to be classed as White ~Iagic.
Grossetete, Robert : Bishop of Lincoln from n35, and
generally known a'> Robert of Lincoln. Among his many
accomptishments he is said to have numbered some pro-
ficiency in the art of magic. Born o! poor parents, be was
early compelled to earn his own living, and even at times
to beg for bread. He was at len.;th •· discovered " by
the }.la.yor of Lincoln, who was attracted by his appear-
ance and the shrewdness of his remarks, and had him
sent to school, where his rem:ukable capacity for study
so qelped his advancement that he was enabled to com-
plete his education at Oxford, Cambridge, and Paris. The
illustrioas Ro~er Bacon characterised him and hi'> friend,
Friar Adam ue ;).1arisco, as the most le:uned men of their
time. He was well skilled in the sciences of mathematics
and astronomy, and a m:1stcr of Greek and Hebrew. As
a member of the clergy he distinguished himself chiefly by
his vi2orous denunciation of tlie abuses in the court of
Rome: and !)arlic11larly of the pope, Innocent IV., whose
Grnagach 195 Gualdi
rule added but little lustre to the church. G1'ossetete did
not hesitate to point out the misdeeds of the ecclesiastical
dignitaries, many of whom had never even visited their
various sees. And he openly pronounced Innocent to be
the Antichrist.
His e'>Says in necromancy include (Gower tells us) the
P.laking of a brazen bead. wh:cb would answer questions
and foretell the future. However, tbi' would appear to
be no unique accompli~bnent, as both Pope Silvester II.,
and Roger Bacon are credited with it.
Gruagaeh: That is" long-haired one,"' fromthcGaelicg,uag,
a wig : a fairy being with protective duties. to be met
with in Scottish legends, and which apparently may be of
e:ther sex. The Gruagach appears. to have been particu-
larly associated with cattle, and milk was Ia:d aside
for him every evening-otherwise no milk would
be got at next milking. Usually this being was of c:.
beneficent nature, although occasionally it showed mis-
chievous traits by loosing the cattle in the byres so that
the herds had to get up, sometimes several times during
a night, to tie them up : this apparently caused the Grua-
gach much delight. There arc many tales m different
parts of Scotland about the Gruagach, from which one
g:1.thers that this fairy commonly had long hair ar.d was
well dressed, of whicbever sex it might happen to be. (See
Scotland).
Gualdi : Dr. Campbel, in his well-known work Hermippus
Rtdivivus or the SCige's Triumph over old age and
the grave relates that this person was probably a
Rosicrucian who lived for several hundreds of years. The
particulars concerning him arc as follows, but they cannot
be verified, and are rej(arded by Godwin as apocryphal :-
He sojourned at Venice for several months, and was known
by the name of the ·• Sober Signior" among the common
people, on account of the regulatity o! his life, the com-
posed simplicity of bis manners and the quietness of his
cos_tume: for he always '~ore dark clothes, and these of a
plain, unpretending style. Three things were remarked
of him during hisstay at Venice. The first was. that he had
a small collection of fine pictures, which he readily showed
to everybody that desired it : the next, that he was per-
fectly versed in all arts and sciences, and spoke always
with such minute particularity as astonished-nav,
silenced-all who heard him, because he seemed to ha.;;e
been present at the things which he related, m~king the
most unexpected corrections in small facts sometimes.
And it was, in the third place, obser\'ed that be neYerwrote
or received any letter, never desired any credit, but always
paid for everything in ready money, and made r.o use of
b:mkcrs, bills of exchange, or letters of credit. However-.
he always seemed to have enough. and he lived respectably,
though with no attempt at splendour or show.
Signor Gualdi met, shortly after his arrival at Venice,
one day, at the coffee-house \\hich he was in the habit of
frequenting, a Venetian nobleman of sociable manners,
who was very fond of art, and this pair used to engage in
sundry discussions, and they had many conversations
concerning the various objects and pursuits which were
interesting to both of them. Acquaintance ripened into
ftiendly esteem. and the nobleman invited Signor Gualdi
to his private house, whereat-for be was a widower-
Signor Gualdi first met the nobleman's daughter, a very
beautiful young maiden of eighteen, of much intelligenct",
and of great accomplishments. The nobleman's daughter
\Vas just introduced at her father's house from a convent, or
pension. where she had been educated by the nuns. This
youn~ lady, in short, from constantly being in his society,
and listening to his narratives, gradually fell in love with
the mysterious stranger, much for the reasons of Desde·
mona ; though SignorGwzldi was no swarthy Moor, but only
a well-educated gentleman-a thinker rathe.r than a doer.
At times. indeed. his countenance seemed to grow splendid
in expression, and he boasted certainly wondrous dis-
course, and a strang~> and weird fascination would grow up
about him, as it were, when he became more than usually
pleased and animated. Altogether, when you were set
thinking about him, he seemed a puzzling person, and of
rare gifts, though when mixing with the crowd you would
scarcely distinguish him from the crowd; nor would you
observe him unless there was something akin to him in you
excited by his talk.
The Venetian nobleman was now on a footing ofsufficient
i~timacy with Signor G~taldi to say to him one evening, at
hts own house, that he understood that he had a nne
collection of pictures, and that, if agreeable. be would pav
him a visit one day for the purpose of viewing them. The
nobleman's daughter, who wr.s present, acd who was
pensively looking down upon the table thinking deeply
of something that the Signor had just said, raised lter eyes
eagerly at this expression of wish by her father, and, as
accorded with her feelings, sho appeared, though she
spoke not, to be desirous to m&ke one of the party to see
the pictures. It was natural that she should secretly
rejoice at this opportunity of becoming more intimately
acquainted with the domestic life oi one wl:om she had
grown to regard with feelings of powerful interc&t. She
felt that t he mere fact of being his ~uest, and under the
roof which was his, would seem to bnng bcr nearer to him.
and, as common with lovers, it seemed that their being
t-hus together would, in feeling at IP<ast, appear to identify
both. Signor Gualdi was very polite, and readily invited
the nobleman to his bouse. and also extended the invitation
to the young lady, should she feel disposed to accompany
her father, since he div!t:ed from the express:on of her
face that she was wishful to that effect. The day for the
visit was then named, and the Signor took his departure
with the exprt'SSion of frier:dship on all sides which usually
ended their meetings.
It followed from this arrangement, that on tht" d&.y
appointed, the father ar:d daughter went to Signor Gualdi's
house. They were received by the Signor with warm
kindL~>.SS. r.nd were shown over his rooms with every mark
of friendliness acd distinction. The nobleman viewed
Signor Gualtii's pictm·cs with great attention, and when he
had completed his tour, he expressed his satisfaction by
telling the Signor that he had never seen a finer collection,
considering tl:e number of pictures. They were now in
Signor Gualdi's own chambcr-t.he last of his set of rooms,-
and tliey were just on the point of turning to go out, and
Gualdi w&s removing the tapestry from before the door to
widen the e~ress, when tlle nobleman, who had pau~ed to
allow him thus to clear the Wl>y, by cbance cast his eyes
upwards over the door, where there hung a picture evidently
of the stranger himself. The Venetian looked upon !t
with doubt, and after a while his face fell ; but it was soon
cleared. as if witb relief. The gazP. of tbe daughter was
also riveted upon the picture, which was very like Gv.aldi
but she regarded it witlt a blush. The Venetian looked
from the picture to Gualdi, and back again from Gualdi to
the picture. lt was some time before he spoke.
"That picn1re was intended !or you, sir," said 'he at
last, hesitating, to Signor Gualdi. A slight cold change
passed over the eyes of the strar:ger; but he only made
reply by a low bow. "You look a moderately young man,
- to be candid with you, sir, I should say about forty-ftve,
or thereabouts-and yet J kr.ow, by certain means of
which I will not now further speak, that this picture is by
the hand of Titian who has been dead nearly a couple of
hundred years. How is this possible ? " he added, with a
polite, grave smile. " Jt is not easy," said Signor Gt!aldi
Gueeulo 196 Gurney
quietly, " to know all things that arc possible, for very
frequent mistakea arc m:\de concerning such; but there is
certainly nothing strange in my being like a picture painted
by Titian." The nobleman easily perceived by his manner,
and by a momentary cloud upon his brow. that tli'e stranger
!elt offence, The daughter clung to her father's arm,
secretly afraid that this little unexj>ected demur might
pass into coolness, and end with a consummation of estrange-
ment, which she feared excessively : she dreaded the
rupture of their intim~cy with the stranger ; and, con-
tradictory as it may seem, she wanted to withdraw, even
without the point she dre:~.ded being cleared up into renewed
pleasant confidence. However, this little temporary mis-
understanding was soon put to an end by Signor Gru•Jdi
himself, who, in a moment or two, resumed his ordinary
manner, and he saw the bther and daughter down-stairs,
and forth to the entrance of his house, with his usual com-
posed politeness-though the nobleman could not help
some feeling of restrOl.int, and his daughter experienced a
considerable amount of mortification ; and she could not
look at Signor Gualdi,-or, uther, when she did, she looked
too much.
This little occurence remained in the mind oi the noble-
man. His daughter felt h)nely and d.issa.tisfied afterwuds,
eager for the restoration 1Jf the same friendly feeling with
Signor Gualdi, and revolving i., her mind numberless
~chemes to achieve it. The Venetian betook himself in
the evening to the usual coffee-house, and he could not
forbear speaking of the incident among the group of people
collected there. Their curiosity was roused, an:! one or two
resolved to ~atisfy themselves by looking at the picture
attentively the next morning. But to oi>tain an oppor-
tunity to see the picture on this next morning, it W.ls
nect>ssary to see the Signor G"aldi so:newhere, and to have
his invitation to his lodgings for the purpose. The only
likely place to meet with him.was at the coffee-house; and
thither the gentlemen went at the usual time, hoping. as it
wa!> the Signor's hab:t to present himself, that he would do
so. But he did not come-nor had he been heard of from
the time of the visit of the nobleman the day before to the
Signor's house-which absence, for a first time almost that
he had been in Venice, surprised everybody. But as they
did not meet with him at the coffee-house-as they thought
was sure-one of the persons who had the oftenest con-
versed with the Signor, and therefore was the freer in his
acquaintance, undertook to go to his lodgings and inquire
after him, which he did ; but he was answered by the
owner of the house, who came to tbe street-door to respond
to the questioner, that the Signor ltad gone, having quitted
Venice that morning early, and that he had locked up his
pictares with certan orders, and had taken the key of his
rooms ''7ith him.
Tbis affair made a great noise at the time in Venice, and
an account of it found its way into most of the newspapers
of the year in which it occurred. In these newspapers, and
elsewhere, an outline of the foregoin~ particulars may be
seen. The account of the Signor Gualdi will also be met
witli in Les M6moires historiques for the year 1687.

Guinelort : A strange story has been left on record by Father
Etienne Bourbon, a Dominican, who died in 1262. He
relates that while he was preaching in the diocese of Lyons,
many women came to h.im confessing that they had taken
their children to St. Guir.efort. Curious to know what sort
of saint it might be whose cult called for conf~ion, Father
BQurbon enquired into the matte!', and found that Guine-
fort was a dog I It was. in fact, that dog which had given
rise to the well-known fable of the dog and the serpent,
where:n a dog is killed under the unjust suspicion that it
has slain a child, which in reality it has saved from the
attack of a ~erpcnt. This dog-martyr it was to whose
'' shrine" the women brought their children.
A similar story is told of a dog named Ganclon, whose
tomb was in Auvergnc, in the neighbourhood of a fountain.
The adventure took place during the reign of Louis le
Debonnaire. Two or three centuries later it was found that
the waters of the iountain possessed medicinal virtues, but
cures were attributed to the unknown occupant of the
tomb-that is, until a cert:J.in bishop found among the
archives of the Cha.tea.u the anecdote of Ganelou.

Gurney, Edmu.nd : A distinguished psychologist and student
of psychic science. He was born at Horsham in 1847, and
educated at Blackheath and Trinity College, Cambridge,
where he obtained a fellowship. He devoted himself
there:lfter to the study o£ ntedicine and passed the second
M.B. C'l.mbridge examination in r88o. Thus equipped, he
turned to the inve.;tigation of psychical research, seeking,
in common with most psychical researchers, to find evidence
for the survival of consciousness and personality after
death. He chose for exploration the region of unconscious
0r subconscious activity-what Mr. Myers, himself a worker
in the same field, has designated the •· subliminal con-
sciousness." From 1874 to 1878 Gurney and Myers worked
with professional mediums, getting but poor rtlSults, but
on the founding of the Society for Psychical Research
experiments of a more s~ientiti.c nature were made. These
resulted in two vo!umc3 of Phantasms of tile Living, by
Messrs. .Myers, Podmore, and Gurney, which went some
way towards e.~tablishing telepathy on a sound basis. To
the same end were directed Mr. Gurney's careful hypnotic

ordered the Strasburg m~gistratcs to send the goldsmith
to him. He was accordingly a:rested and guarded with
the ~eatcst vigilance. On learning that he was to be sent
to the Emperor at Prague he disclosed the whole business
and requesting the magistrates to meet together ::sked
them to procure 11. crucet and charcoal, and without his
co:ning near them to melt some lead. On the met<tl bein~
molten he then g:we them a small quantity of a reddish
powder on which being thrown into the crucct produced a
considerable amount of pllre gold.
On being brought into the presence of the Emperor he con-
fessed that he ha<t not hims2U prepared the magical powder
and was wholly ignorant of the nature of its composition.
This the Emperor refused to believe in spite of the repeated
protestations of the goldsmith. The powder being at
length exhausted, GuM~mhover was set to the now ir:toossible
task of making more gold. He sought refuge from the
fury of the Emperor by an alchemical blasphemy accursed
by all sons of the doctrine. Convinced that the alche-
mist was concealing his secret, the Emperor had him im-
prisoned for the rest of his life.
It is believed that Hirschborgen who prese:tted Gu.~le>~­
hover with the powder was no other than Alexander Sethon
(q.v.), who at that period was tra,·clling Germ'lny in va·dous
disguises.
Guyoil, Madame (1648-17I7): Jeanne ?.Iarie Bouv~ercs de
Ia Mothe, a celebrated mystic and quietest who suffered
m:~ch persecution at the hands of the Church of Rome.
She was born at i\fo:1targis on Apr;J 13th, 1648, and early
showed a passion for martyrdom and religiO!ls exercises.
As she grew older vanity took the place of devotion, for
she was both witty and beautiful. At the age of sbcteen
she was forced into a marriage with the wealthy :VI. Guyon,
mo~e than twenty years her senior, in whose household she
was exposed to msult and cruelty. Broken in spirit she
turned once more to religion. and consulted a Frn:-tcisc:m,
who advised her to seek Go<.! in her heart rather than in
outward observances. Fro:n that time she becam~ a
mystic, aiming at the suppression of all hum:ln hopes and
fears, <".nd desires, and the attainment of a completely
disinterested love of God. She embraced every form of
suffering, physic:ll and ment~l. and even eschewed spiritual
joys. ln 16So i\l. Guyon died, and his widow w.~s released
from bond,\gc. Henceforth she embraced the <lnctrinc of
quietism. In losin~ the gifts," she said, ·' she h~-d found
the Giver, and had reached an ideal state of resignation
and self-suppression." She went to Paris, expoundP.d her
theories with earnestness and charm, and gathered an
illustrious circle about her. Here also she made friends
with Fenelon. But the pcr~ecut!ons of the Church increased
She herself rc1uestcd that a commi.<~sion be appointed to
examine her doctrint> and writings. Three commissioners
were chosen, amon~ them Bossuet, the champion of the
Church, her erstw~ile friend <lnd now her bitter enemy.
Her writings were condemned, and she herseli incarcerated
at Vincennes. For four years she lay in the dungeons of
the Bastilc, while Bossuet used every means to c-alumniate
her name and doctrine. In 1702, her health broken, she
was released and sent to Blo~s where she died in 1707. Her
last years were blCJ<~cd with oeace and resignation, and
such a subl!lission to t~i...L., as she had ever shown.
Gwion Bach : In Wel~h romance and myth, son of Gwreang.
Set by Ceridwin to stir the magic cauldron of science and
im;piration intended to be drunk by her son, Gu·ion ta.-;ted
the liquid and became gifted with supernatural sight.
He fled, pursued by Ceridwin, and the pair were changed
successively into a hare and a greyhound, a fish and an
otter, a bird and a hawk, a gr?.in of wheat and a black hen,
which ultimatelr swallowed the wheat. (Compare the
metamorphoses of Ceridwe:t ;l.nd Gu:ion IJach with that of
the Quce:1 of Beauty and the Djinn in the hYabian Nights,
T~le of the Second Calendar). Later Gwion was placed in a
bag and f!ung into the sea by Ceridwin. He was drawn
out by Elphin, son of Cwyddus, and was now called Taliesin
(Radiant Brow).
Gypsies : The name Gypsy, an abbrevi<.tion of " Egyptian,"
has been used for centuries by English-spe.'\king people to
denote a member of a certain cast~ of turbulent wanderers
who traYcil<:d Europe during the l\.lidrlle Ages, and whose
descendt.nts, in a much-decayed condition, are still found
in most European countries. Many other names, such as
•· Sarac!)n·" and " Zigcuncr," or " Cigan,'' have been
applied to these people, but " Egyptian " is the most;
widespread in time and place. It c!ors not relate to Egypt,
but to the country of" Little Egypt " or " Lesser Egypt,"
whose identity has never been clearly established. Two
Tnnsylvanian referenccn of the years 1417 and r.p8
indicate that Palestine is the country iu question, but there
is some reason to believe that "Little Egypt" included
other regions in the Levant. Cyp~ies speak ot themselves
as RomaT!c, ar.ct of thc!r language as Romani-t.:hib (tchib=:
tongue). Physically, they arc black-haired and brown-
s!..-inned, their a!'pcarancc, like their language, suggesting
affiQities with Hindustan. But. although possessing
marked rao:ial chv;!Cteristics, for the most part, they must
also be regarded as a ca~te or organization. In recent
cent uries, if not in earlier limes. many of their over-iords
were not of G}rpsy blood, but belo~ed lo the nobility and
petite noblesse of Eu~opc, and were formally appointed by
the kings and governments or their respective countries to
rule over :'111 the Gypsies resident within those countrie!S.
The title or baron, count, or regent of the Gypsies was no
proof that the official so designated was of Gypsy race.
This fact must always be bo~ne in mind in any consideration
of the Gypsy system.
The rulers thus appointed, bcin;: empowered by Christian
princes, and under Papal approval, were necessarily
Christian. l\foreover. their vassals werP. at least Christian
by profession. Although thc!r behaviour was often wildly
inconsistent with such a. proks,ion, it was in the chara<:ter
of Christia:t pilgrims that they :-.skcd and Obt<\ined hospital-
ity from the cities anrl towns of Medireval Europe. On
the other !cnnd, t!lcy s~··r.1 t•l h<~YC practised rites wJ::ch
could not b:! described a<> Clt•istbL TLi; twofold charactt'r
is i:tustrated in conacrtion with the servirel' which thev
still hold in the crypt of the church of Les Saintes Marit>·s
de l.l )fer, in the II~ de h 1.:-.margue, Bo•!Ch<s-du-Rhone.
In this church .the Festi·~;d u! lhe Holy l\1~.rys is annually
celebrated on 25th ~lay, a:1d to it the Gyps:'es come in great
numbers. The crypt is specially reserved for them,
because it cont&.hls the shrine of Saint Sara of Egypt, whom
they reg.ud as their patron ~..int. Throughout t.'1e night
of 24th-25th May they keep watch over her shrine, and on
the zsth t!1cy take their departure. Among the Grpsy
Gypsies 198
votive offerings presented 1n the crypt, some arc believed
tn d;,te back to about tt1c ye.\1 q)O. All this would appear
to indicate th:1t the Gypsies were Christi~ns. Anotbl'r
statement, however, tends to qualify such a conclusion
This is the assertion tbilt th~ s!lriue of Saint Sara rest; upon
an ancient altar dcdic:lted to ;".lithu; that the Gypsies of
that neighbourhood who a<e kutlwn as " Cah.gues," are
descended from the Iberians formerly inhabiting the
Camargue; and that their cult is really the l\1itbraic wor·
ship of fire and water, upon which the veneration of Saint
Sara is super-imposed.
Confumation of this vie'v may be obtained from the
worship of fire still existing among the Gypsies of Southern
Hungary. The ceremonies observed at child-birth, in order
to avert evil dwing the period between birth and baptism,
may be taken as evidence. Prior to the birth of the child,
the Gypsies light a fire before the mother's tent, and this
fire is not suffered to go out ~ntil the rite of baptism has
been performed. The women who light and feed the fire
croon, as they do so, the following chaut :-
Burn ye, burn ye fast, 0 Fire 1
And guard the babe from wrathful ire
Of earthy Gnome and Water-Sprite,
Whom with thy dark smoke banish quite 1
Kindly Fairies, hither fare,
And let the babe good fortune share,
Let luck attend him ever here,
Throughout his life be luck aye near !
Twigs and branches now in store,~ b.
And still of branches many more, 1 IS.
Give we to thy flame, 0 Fire !
Burn ye, burn ye, fast and high,
Hear the little baby cry I
It will be noted that the spirits of the Earth and Water
are here regarded as malevolent, and only to be overcome
by the superior aid of fire. Nevertheless, those women
who are believed to have learned their occult lore from
the unseen powers of Earth and \Vater are held to be the
greatest magicians of the tribe. 1\Ioreover, the water-
being is not invariably regarded as inimical, but is some-
times directly propititated. As when a mother, to charm
away convulsive crying in her child, goes through the
prescribed ceremonial in all its details, of which the last is
this appeal, as she casts a red thread into the stream :-
.. Take this thread, 0 Water-Spirit, and take with it the
crying of my child ! If it gets well, I will bring thee apples
and eggs I " The water-spirit appears again in a friendly
character when a man, in order to recover a stolen horse,
takes his infant to a stream, and, bending over the water,
asks the invisible genius to indicate, by means of the baby's
band, the direction in which the horse has been taken. In
these two instances we have a clear survival of the worship
of water and the watery powers. It may be questioned
whether these rites ought to be ascribed to Mithraism in
its later stages, or whether they own an earlier origin.
One definite statement with regard to Gypsy lore is
afforded by Joseph Glanvil, in a passage which inspired
Matthew Arnold's poem of" Tile Scholar-Gypsy." '' There
was lately a lad in the University of Oxford," says Glanvil
{Vanity of Dogmatising, 1661), ·• who was, by his poverty,
forced to leave his studies there, and at last to joi:n himself
to a company of vagabond Gypsies." Glanvil goes on to
say that'' after he had been a pretty while exercised in the
trade.'· thi~; scholar-gypsy chanced to meet two of his
former fellow-students, to whom he stated~-" that the
people he went with were not such impostors as they were
taken for, but that they had a traditional kind of learning
among them, and could do wonders by the powers of
imagination, their fancy binding that of others; that
him.~elf had learned much of their art, and when be had
Gypsies
compassed the whole secret, be intended," he ~;aid, "to
leave their company, and give the world an account of
what he had learned."
Here we have clear indications of the possession of a
body of esoteric learning, which included the knowted~e
and exercise of hypnotism. Even among modern Gypsus
this power is exerciesd. De Rocbas states that the Catalan
Gypsies are mesmerists and clairvoyants, and the present
\vriter has experienced an attempt on the part of a South
Hungarian Gypsy to exert this influence. The ~ame
power, under the name ofglamour, was former!y an attnbute
of the Scottish Gypsies. Glamour is defined by S1r Walter
Scott as " the power of imposing on the eyesight of the
spectators, so that the appearance of an object shall. be
totally different from the reality." And, in explanatlon
of a referencet'o "the Gypsies' glamour'd gang," in one of his
ballads, he remarks : '' Besides the prophetic .powers
ascribed to the Gypsies in most European countnes, the
Scottish peasants believe them possessed ~f the po.wer of
throwing upon bystanders a spell to .casemate thc1~ eyes
and cause them to see the thing that 1S not. Thus 1n the
old ballad of • Johnnie Faa.' the elopement of the.Cou.n~ess
of Ca~llis with a Gypsy leader is imputed to fascJnatJOn-
• Sile soon as they saw her wcel-faur'd face,
They cast the glamour o'er ber.' " .
Scott also relates an incident of a Gypsy who ·• exerctsed
his glamour over a number of people at Had~i~gton, to
whom be exhibited a common dung-hill cock, tra1hng. what
appeared to the spectators, a massy oaken truuk. A.n old
man passed with a cart of clover, he stopped and p1cked
out a four-leaved blade; the eyes of the spectators wer.~
opened, and the oaken trunk appeared to be a bulrush.
The quatrefoil, owing to its cruciform shap~. acted as a
powerful antidote to witchcraft. Moreover, 111 th~ face of
this sign of the Cross, the Gypsy was bound to desl.St from
the exercise of what was an unlawful art. As to the
possibility of hypnotizing a crowd, or m~king them " to
see the thing that is not," that feat is ach1eved to-d~y by
African witch-doctors. What is required i;; ~ do!'filn~nt
will on the on<; band and a sufficiently plastic tmagmaoon
on the other
Scott introduces these statements among his notes on
the ballad of " Christie's Wtll," in relation to the verse-
" He thought the wJ.rlocks o' the rosy cross,
Had fang'd him in their nets sae fast;
Or that the Gypsies' glamour'd gang
Had lair'd his learning at the last."
This association of Rosicrucians with Gypsies is not i~apt,
for hypnotism appears to have been considered a R;ostcr~­
cian art. Scott bas other suggestive refer~nces m th's
place. " Saxo Grammaticus mentions a parttclllar sect of
Mathematicians, as he is pleased to call t~~m, who, ' ~er
summam ludific:>.udorum oculorum penbam, propn?s
alicnosque vultus, varus rerum im:1ginibus, adumbrat.~
callebant; illicibusque formis veros obscurar<! C?nsp~ctus..
Merlin, the son of Ambrose, was particularly skillcxlm this
art, and displays it often in the old metrical romance of
Arthour and Merlin. The jongleurs were also great pro-
fessors of this mystery, which has in some degree descended,
with their name, on the modern jugglers." • . .
It will be seen that various SOCieties are cred1ted Wlth
the possession, in an eminent degree, of th~ art·o_f hy{>no-
tism, during the Middle Ages. Presumably,lt was t~hented
from one common source. How much the Gypsus w~re
associated with this power may be inferred from a Scottish
Act of Parliament of the year 1379. which was ~irected
against " the idle people calling themselves Egypttans, or
any other that fancy themselves to have knowledge of

prophecy, cluvming, or other abused SCiences." For the
term ··charming," like •· glamour" and other kindred
words (e.g." enchantment," ·• bewitched," "spellbound")
bore reference to the mesmeric influence.
The statement mlde by Glanvil's scholar-gypsy woultl
lead one to believe that the Gypsies inlt?.biting England in
the seventeenth century posses~ed other branches of learn-
ing. They ba·1e alway~ been famed for their alleged pro-
phetic power, exerci~ed through the medium of astrolocry
and chiromancy or palmistry, and also by the interpretati~n
of dreams; th:s h.o;t-named phase being distinctly specified
in Scotland in t6tt.f It doe~ not appear that any modern
Gypsies prof~s a knowledge of astrology. ::-o;evertheless, it
is inte•est:ng to note that Gmome t wa<~ shown by a Welsh
Gypsy-man the for:n of the written charm employed by his
mother in her fortune-tellin~. and that form is unquestion-
ably a survival of the bo•oscope. Both mother and son
were obviously unaware of that f.1ct, and made no pro-
fession of astrology; but they had inhented the scheme
of t!te horoscope from ancestors who were astrologers.
Tne practice of chiromancy is still a Gypsy art, ::.s it has
been for ::.ges. A curiou~ belief was current in mediawal
times to the etfect that the three Kings or :'olagi who came
to Uethlehem were Gypsies, and in more than one religious
play they are represented as telling the fortunc3 of the Holy
Family by means of palmistry. This circumstance has
evoked the following suggestive remarks from C. G. Leland.ll
'' As for the connection of the Three Kings with Gy psies,
it is plain enough. GypS!u w~:re from the East ; Rome
and the world abounded in wandering Chaldean magi-
priests, and the researches '"hich 1 am making have led
me to a firm conclusion that the Gyp.~y lore of Hungary
and South Slavonia has a very original character as oong.
firstly, thou;:h derived from India, not Arya11, but Shamanic,
t hat is, of an Altaic, or Tartar, or ' Turanian ' stock. ....
Secondly, this was the old Chaldean-Accadian · wisdom '
or sorcery. Thirdly-and this deserves serious examin-
ation-it was also the old Etruscan rebgion whose magic
formulas were tran~mitted to the Romans. . . . .
" The Venetian witchcraft, as set forth by Bemoni, is
evidently of Sclavic-Greek origin. That of the Romagna
is Etruscan, a9reeing very strangely and closely with the
Chaldean mag1c of Lenormant, and marvellously like the
Gyps~s·. It does not, when care!ullr sifted, seem to be
like that of the Aryans..... nor b 1t Semitic. To what
degree some idea of all this, and of Gypsy connection with
it, penetrated among the people and filtered down, even
into the ~Iiddle Ages, no one can say. But it is very
probable that through the centuries there came together
some report of the common origin of Gypsy and ' Eastern '
or Chaldean lore, for, since it wa.s the same, there is no
reason why a knowledge of the truth should not have been
disseminated in a time of a traditions and earnest study in
occultism."
These surmises on the part of a keen and accomplished
student of every phase of magic, written and unwritten, are
deserving of the fullest consideration. By following the
line indicated by Leland it may be possible to reach an
identific::.tion of the " traditional kind of learning"
possessed by the Gypsies in the seventeenth century.
DAVID MAcRx-rcmE.
Gyromancy : Was performed by going round continually in
a circle, the circumference of which was marked by letters.
The pres'l.ge was drawn from the words formed by the
letters on which the inquirers stumbled when they became
too giddy to stand. The object of this circumcursation
wa<; simply to exclude the interference of the will, and
reduce the selection of letters to mere chance. In some
species of enchantment, however, the act of turning round
wa.<; to produce a propaetic delirium. The religious dances,
and the rotation of certain fanatics on one foot, with their
arms stretched out, are of this nature. These ca~eo; really
indicate a magic.1.l secret, of which, however, the deluded
victims rarely possessed any knowledge. In the phenome-
non known as St. Vitus's Dance, and the movements of the
convulsionaries, manifestations of spiritual intelligence
we~e quite common. The tendancy of the spiritual force
is to act spirally, rhythmically, whether in the use of lan-
guage or of the bodily members.

Hallucination : A false perception of sensory vividness arising
witilo~t the stimu!.ls of a corresponding sense-impression.
In this it differs irom iiJusion, which is merely the misinter-
pretatio:t of an actual sense-perception. Visu?.l and
auditory hallucinalions are the mo~t common, and especially
the form:::r; b'Jt h:zlladnatio11 of the other senses may also
be experienced, though it is not so readily distinguishable.
Hum:.n figures and voices mc>St frequently form the subject
of a h-:Allucination, but in certain types other classes of
objects m<.Ly be secn-:.s, for instance, the rats and insects
or deliYium IYemens. Though hallu~illation is often
associated with various mental and physical diseases, it
may, neve~theless occur spontaneously while the agent
show; no dep.1rture from full vigour of body and mind, and
m1ybe induced--i.e., in hypnotism-in about 90 per cent.
of all subjects. The essential diHerence between sane and
insane Hallut-inalio11S is that in the former case the agent
can. by reflection, recognise the subjective nature of the
impression, even when it has every appearance of obj~:ctiv­
ity; whereas in the htter case the patient cannot be made
to understand that the vision is not real.
l.;ntil comparatively recently Halluclnattry percepts
were regarded merely as intensified memory-images. hut
as the most intense of ordinary representations do not
possess that sensory viviclness which IS yet a feature of
Ham 200 HalTis
the smallest sensation rec.eived from· the external world,
It follows that other conditions must be present besides the
excitement of the brain-elements which is the correlate of
representation. Itis true that the seat of excitement is the
same both in actual.sense-perceptionsand in memory ima~es
but in the former case the stimulas i~ peripherallyoriginated
in the sensory nerve, whereas in the latter it takes its rise
in the brain itself. Now if any neural system becomes
highly excited-a state which may be b:ought about by
emotion, ill-health, drugs, or a number of causes-it may
serve to divert from their proper paths any set of impulses
arising from the sense organs, and as any impulse ascending
through the sensory nerves produces an effect of sensory
vividness-normally, a true perception-the impulses
thus diverted give to the memory images an appearance of
actuality, not distinguishable from that produced by a
corresponding sense-impression. In hypnosis a state of
cerebal dissociation is induced. whereby any one nc~ral
system may be abnormally excited, and hallucination
thus very readily engendered. Drugs which excite the
brain also induce hallucinalions.
The question or whether there is any relation between
the hallueination and the person it represents is, and has
long been, a vexed one. Countless well-authenticated
stories of apparitions coinciding with a death or some
other crisis are on record, and would seem to establish
some causal connection between them. In former times
apparitions, were considered to be the " doubles" or
" ethereal bodies " of the originals, and modern spiritualists
believe that they are the spirits of the dead-or, mayhap,
of the living, temponi.ri!y forsaking the physical organism.
But the main theory among those who believe in such a.
causal connection between agent and kaUueination-and
in view of the statistics collected by Professor Sidgwick
and others (See" Psychic Research"), it is difficult not to
believe-is that of telepathy, or thought-transference.
That the cerebral machinery for the transmission of thought
should be specially stimulated in moments of intense
excitement, or at the approach of dissolution, is not to be
wondered at ; and thus it is sought to account for the
appearance of hallucinatory images coinciding with death
or other crises. .Moreover, the dress and appearance of the
apparition does not necessarily correspond with the actual
dress and appearance of its original. Thus a man at the
point of death, in bed and wasted by disease, may appear
to, a friend as if in his ordinary health, and wearing his
ordinarx garb. Nevertheless there are notable instances
where some remarkable detail of dress is reproduced in the
apparition. It seerns clear, however, that it is the agent's
g·eneral personality which is, as a rule, conveyed to the
percipient, and not. except in special cases, the actual
matter of his surface-consciousness.
A similar explanation has been offered for the hallucina-
tory images which many people can induce by gazing in a
crystal, or even in a pool of water, or a. drop of ink, and
which are often declared to give information, ari«i-reproduce
scenes and people of whom the agent has no knowledge.
It is suggested that those images which do ·not arise in the
subliminal consciousness of the agent may have been
telepathically received by him from other minds. (See
" Crystal•gazlng.")
Collective Hallucination is a term applied to hallucina-
tions which are shared by a number of people. There is no
evidence, however, of the operation of any other agency
than suggestion (q.v.) or at the most, telepathy.

Hand of Glory : The hand of a dead man, in which a lighted
candle has been placed. It was formerly believed in
Ireland and Mexico to be an instrument of magic. If the

the candle itself will remain invisible. To be truly effica-
cious, however, both hand and candle must be prepared in a.
special manner.
Hands of Splrt.ts : There are instances in occult history where
the hand only of a spirit has become visible to the human
eye. During the reign of James I. a vision of this kind
came to a certain clerk who was engaged in writing a will
which was to disinherit a son. It took the form of a fine
white hand, which appeared bet\\'een the candle and the
parchment, casting a shadow on the latter. It came three
times, till the clerk, becoming alarmed, threw down his
pen and refused to finish the work. In the Book of Daniel
it is related : " In the same hour came forth fingers of a.
man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon
the plaster of the wall of the Icing's palace: and the king
(Belshazzar) saw the part of the hand that wrote." There
are also many instances of writing being done without
human hands. and a Mr. Wolf, of Ohio, states that he has
shaken hands with spirits, as " substantially" as one
man shakes hands with another. After a certain vision.
it is recorded that Daniel was touched by a hand, which
set him upon his knees and upon the palms of his hands.

that people are most exposed to its attacks at that time
Its method of suffocation is to press on the breast and thus
impede the action of the lungs.

probably carried to London by the Earl of Derwentwater.
This latter may have been a Scotch rite in very early times.
Harris, T!lomas Lake, r823-1906 :- An American spiritual-
ist born in Buckinghamshire, who, with his parents,
emigrated to the United States when he was of a. tender age.
He adopted the profession of a preacher of the Universalist
Church, out afterwards became a Swedenborgia.n. He
attached himself to Davis (q.v.), but after the latter's
exposure he deserted him and established himself as a
preacher at New York, where he gathered round him a
considerable congregation. \Vhen about twenty-seven·
years of age, he began to pose as the possessor of prophetic
power, and produced a number of poems, which are not
without a certain merit 9f their own. These he was able
to improvise with such rapidity as to lead many to the
Haruspication 201 Haunted Houses
belief that be was indeed divinely inspired. Somewhere
about the year 1859 ilc visited London where in certain
circles his verse WJ.S admir~d. On rctu'rning to America,
he founded a small commumty near New York. of which he
beca~e .the head.. Its me~bers were of a heterogeneous
descnption, composmg Amencan ladies of means, Japanese,
cl~rgymen, and the author, Laurence Oliphant, with ltis
wtfe and mother. This community Harris called the
Brotherhood of the New Life, and a little later on it was
decided to change its site to the shores of Lake Erie. The
principal industry of the community was wine-maJd'ng
and for this Harris was called to account by the temperanc~
party. but he su.mmarily dismissed their objections by
stating that the WJne he made was the direct vehicle of the
Divine Breath. His theology was a curious one : he
believed that the Creator was androgyne, and he favoured
married celibacy. The mode of breathing professed by him
appears to have been imitated from that in vogue among
certain Buddhist C<lstcs, but it was to l>e the mark of the
faithful. In r88r the Oliphaots seceded from his rule, and
cha~ged him with fraud. They took legal proceedings
aga1nst him, and succeeded in recovering considerable sums
in this manner. Oliphant believed to the last that Harris
possessed psychical powers, but there is no doubt at all that
he was extremely avariciO\lS and licentious as his books of
verse, issued to a select circle, prove. In r8gr be pro·
claimed that he had renewed his youth, and that he had
discovered what amounted to the elixir of life. On his
death in 1906 his disciples would not believe that lie had
passed away, but thought he was only sleeping. He died,
in March, and it was not uti! June that his demise was
publicly acknowledged by his followers. His who!~
philosophy was directed toW<Lrds the breaking down the
established order of the relations of the sexes. His sect
had a jargon of its own, and its language was often inftated
and absurd. But with all his failings, and they were many,
Harris 'vas a man of considerable gifts, among which may
b~ noted some poetic fervour and fluency and force of
character.
Baruspication : (See Divination.)
BasJdim (" Pious Ones ") : Devotees of a mystical phase of
Judaism. They are first heard of in the pre-!.'rlaccabean
age. In the first centuries of the Christian era we again
hear of the Ha.sidim, sometimes supposed to be the descen-
dants of the earlier sect. The later Hasidim were saints
and workers of miracles, gifted with esoteric wisdom and
the prophetic faculty. Early in the eighteenth century
there arose yet another sect of the same name, having for its
aim the revival of spirituality in the Jewish religion.
Representatives of this mystic body arc still to be found in
Hungary, Poland, and Russia.
Basona : (See Magie.)
Hassan Sabab : (See Assassins.)
Bastraun : A small mystical sect of Judaism, whose mem-
bers were.to be found insome partsof Palestine and Babylon.
They practised some sort of communism, and were known
also as " fearers of sin."
Batba Yoga : The earliest and therefore most simple form
of the Yoga practice. An English translation of the
Hatha Yoga Pradipika of Swatmaram Swami was published
in 1893· This book consists of four chapters: the first
containing advice as to surroundings, conduct, postures,
etc. ; the second dealing with breathing practice, prepara-
tion, purification; the third gives ten .Mttdras which
confer miraculous powers ~ and the fourth is a sort of
supplement, and d~als ...,;th the results of Yoga practice.
The fruits of Yoga are detailed, and arc of a very omniscient
character.
Bautre, Frederfea : Better known as the " Seeress of Pro·
vost," a somnambule who came under the observation of
Dr. Jl!stinus T~emer, a well-known poet ar:d physician,
early 1n the mneteenth century. A natural trance and
convulsive patient, she came to Kerner to be magnetised,
b1_1t he endeavoured at first to treat her by medicinal means.
~mding these unavailing, however, he resorted to magnet-
Ism. . H~nceforward ~be Se;eress passed the greater part of
her hfe m trance, d1splaymg all the usual somnambulic
phenomena. (See l'ttagndlsm under article Hypnotism.)
She saw. and conversed with apparitions, developed remark-
a~le. clal.rvoyant faculties, and dealt also in mysticism, des-
cnblng mtncate symbolical circle-systems. She was also
the a1_1thor ~f a " primitive" language, constructed with
some tngen.Ulty, which purported to be that tongue, spoken
byth.epatriarcbsof old, wherein the wordsconveyedinsome
mystic manner the properties of the things they designated.
Dr. Kerner and others were sometimes able to see Fra1~
Hau!je's ghostly interlocutors, as dim grey pillars of cloud.
Phys1cal phenomena of a poltcrgeistic character were also
of common occurrence in her presence.
Haunte~ Houses : Not long ago a number of the daily papers
contained, throughout several consecutive weeks, an
a.dvertlscmcnt offering for sale " an ancient Gothic Man-
sion, known as Beckington Castle, ten miles from Bath and
two from Frome"; and the writer of this advertisement
after exp<Ltiating on the noble scenery around Beckington.
and the rare aTChitectural beauty of the house itself,
proceeded to say that the place was the more desirable
because it was reported to be haunted I No doubt there
are people ~\'ho long !or a house containing a bona fide
ghost, and 1t is sometimes said that the rich tradesman
anxious to turn himself into a squire, invariably look~
out for a haunted manor, while some waggish writers have
dec~ared: indeed, that nowadays ghosts arc to be bought at
\V:~tely.s, an~ that the demand for them among American
rmlli~n;ures IS stupendous. And, if the purchaser of
Beckington Castle had to pay an additionally high price
becau<;e the place rejoiced in a veritable ghost, in reality
anything of this sort usually makes a house almost unsalc-
able. At Lossiemouth, for example, on the east coast of
Scotland, a fine old mansion stood untenanted for years, and
was eventually l>old !or a merely nominal sum ; and the
reason. w~, simply, that according to popular tradition
the butld1ng was paraded nightly by a female figure draped
i~ white, her throat bearing an ugly scar, and her hands
tied behind her back with chains. !\or is it merely concern-
ing old Manors iu the country that stories of this nature are
current, and, even in many densely-populated towns there
exist to this day houses rt'puted to be haunted, which are
quite unsaleablc.
It would seem that royal palaces, cfosely watched and
guarded as they arc nowadays, and invariably have beeu,
are not altogether destitute of S11Cb inhabitants. For a
legend contends that Windsor Castle is frequently visited
by the ghost of Sir George Villiers, and it is said, moreover.
that once, in the reign of Charles I., this ghost appeared
to one of the king's gentlemen-in-waiting, and informed.
h.im that the Duke of Buckingham would shortly fall by
the hand of an assassin-a prophecy which was duly ful-
filled soon after, as all readers of Les 1·rois M oufquetaires-
·will doubtless remember, the incident figuring in that
immortal story. Then at Hackwood House, near Basing-
stoke, there is a room in which no one dares to sleep, all
dreading " the grey ,,·oman " ~cpposcd to appear there
nightly; while Wyccollcr Hall, r.ear Coine, toasts a spectre
horseman who 1-isits the place once a year, ar.d rides at full
speed through the garden. Very different is the legend
attached to Dilston, in Tyncside. where a bygone Lady
\Vindcrmere is said to appear frqm time lo time, and indulge
in loud lamentations !or her unfortunate husband, who was
Jlaunted Houses 202
executed for his share in the Jacobite rising of 1715 ; while
at Salmesbury Hall, Blackburn, there is a ghost of yet
another kind, the people of the neighbourhood affirming
that periodically they see a weird lady and her knight
promenading the grounds of the Hall, indulging the while
in silken dallian'Ce. Jt need hardly be said, perhaps, that
ghosts of this particular nature are remarkably common, and
bulk largely in the spirituallore of nearly every county ; but
the more gruesome apparitions predominate withal, and
among these is the ghost of Amy Robsart, which still
haunts the manor of Cumnor, in Oxfordshire. For it must
be borne in mind that Amy was a real woman, and not a
mere creation of Sir ·walter Scott's brain. She was married
iii 1550 to the Earl of Leicester, and her tragic death is
commonly laid to his charge; but a tradition exists to the
~ffect that Queen Elizabeth was really the responsible
person, and recalling an authentic portrait of Amy, which
bespeaks her a woman of charm and of no ordinary beauty,
it is easy to believe that the ill-favoured queen hated her
and took strong measures to get her o~1t of the way.
Numerous rectories rejoice in the ghost of a clergyman,
erstwhile murdered by his infuriated parishioners : and
there are several hazmled monasteries and convents, while
at Holy Trinity Church at York a phantom nun appears
<>ccasionally on winter evenings, and walks about muttering
paternosters. The story concerning her is that, on one
occasion, during a period of civil-war, a band of soldiers
were minded tosack the edifice in question, and on approach-
ing it with this intention they were confronted by an abbess,
who bade them beware of the divine wrath they would
surely incur if they committed an act of sacrilege. Thcv
laughed at her piety, and, never thinking she would offer
.any resistance, they tried to march eu masse into the
building, but, hardly bad they coml'!lcnced the assault, ere
their opponent snatched a sword from one of them, and
stood bravely on the defensive. A fierce battle ensued,
the abbess proving herself a veritable amazon, and slaying
a host of her foes ; yet she lost her life ultimately, and her
ghost it is which still frequents the church she sought to
.defend.
There are few parts of England so rich in romance as
Sherwood Forest, once the scene of Robin Hood's exploits;
and there is at least one place in this region which claims
a number of ghosts. Newstead Abbey, the seat of Lord
Byron's ancestors. A part of the garden there is popularly
known as '· the devil's wood," a name which points to the
place having been infested once by minions of the foul
fiend, while one of the rooms in the house is haunted by a
certain ··Sir John Byron, the little, of the grey beard,"
who presumably ended his days in some uncanny fashion.
His portrait hangs over the hall in the dining-room, and a
young lady, staying at Newstead about the middle of last
century, contended stoutly that once she had entered this
room to find the portrait gone, and it~ subject seated by
the fireside reading a black-letter folio ! The poet Byron
himself cherished very fondly all the ghostly traditions
which clung round his home. and it is recorded that, on his
learning that there were stone coffins underneath the
house, he straightway had one of them dug up and then
opened. He used some of its gruesome contents to "dec-
orate" his own library, while he had the coffin itself
placed in the great hall, through which thereafter the
servants were afraid to pass by night. He also utilised
the supernatural lore of Newstead in one of his poems, and
from this we learn that a spectre friar was wont to parade
the mansion whenever some important event was wont to
befall its owneTS :-
" When an heir is born he is heard to mourn,
And when ought is to befall
That ancient line, in the pale.moonshine
Haunted Houses
He \valk~ from hall to hall.
His form you may trace, but not his face,
'Tis shadowed by his cowl ;
But his eyes may be seen from the folds bet,,..een,
And thev seem of a parterl soul.

And he'll say nought to you :

Pa5Sing from England to Ireland we find many luuwted
h01Hes ; for instance, Dunseverick in Antrim, where
dwells still the soul of a bygone chief. so wicked in his
lifetime that even hell's gates are closed to him. And
passing from Ireland to Scotland we find numerous haunted
buildings too, notably Holyrood Palace and the castles of
Hcrm:ta~e and Glamis. It is the ghost of the murdered
Rizzio which frequents Holyrood, yet it should be added
that the vision is seldom seen nowadays; and mayhap the
fates, aware that the Italian minstrel was shamefully
treated, have at length accorded his so;ll a resting-place
more cosy than the dismal Edinburgh Palace. But the
ghost of Hermitage, on the contrary, is still considerably
addicted to exercise. and in truth his story marks him as
having been a man of rare activity a!l.d ;:mbition. Lord
Soulis was h.is name, and. possibly after hearing of Faustus'
exploits, he vowed that be too would exorcise the devil,
who generously made his appearance betimes. "Vast
power will be yours on earth," said the evil one to Soulis
''if you will but barter your soul therefor" ; so his lord-
ship signed the requisite compact with his life's blood, and
thenceforth his days were given over to the enjoyment of
every conceivable pleasure. Anon, however, he felt that
his end was near, and calling some of his vassals around
him he told them of the awful fate awaiting him after
death. Thunderstruck they were, but soon after Soulis
was gone it occurred to them that, could they but destroy
his mortal remains completely, they might save his soul
from the clutches of Beelzebub. So having sheathed the
corpse in lead they flung it into a burning fiery furnace,
and manifestly this cremation saved his lordship from the
nether regions, for b.ad he gone there his soul would not
have been active still at Hermitage. .
The ghost-story associated with Glamis Castle, the
family seat of the Earl of Strathmore, is quite different
from the rank and file of supernatural tales, and bears a
more naked semblance of veracity than pertains to any of
these. It is a matter of common knowledge that there is
a secret chamber at Glamis, a chamber which enshrines a
mystery known only to a few members of the Strathmore
family, and three or four generations ago a lady, staying as
a visitor at Glamis. voved she would solve the riddle.
Her first difficulty was to locate the actual room, but one
afternoon, when all the rest of the household were going
out, she feigned a headache and thus contrived to be left
completely alone. Her next move was to go from room
to room. putting a handkerchief in the window of each,
and having done this she went outside and walked round
the castle to see whether any room had evaded her search.
Very soon she observed a. window which had no handker-
chief in it, so she hastened indoors again, thinking that her
quest was about to be rewarded. But try as she might she
could not find the missing room; and while she was search-
ing the other guests returned to the house, along with them
being the then Lord Strathmore. He was fiercely incensed
on learning wbat had been going forward, and that night
shrieks were heard in a long corridor in the castle. The
Hayden 203 HeaUng
guests ran out of their rooms to find out what was wrong,
and in tlie dim light they perceived a curious creatu-~
''lith an inhum:J.n head, wrestling with an aged m n-
servant who eventu!l.lly contrived to carry the mo H:er
away. There the story ends, but as remarked bef ·~ ~ it
bears a semblance of truth, the probability bei••! that
somescion of the Glamis castle family was mad or hideously
deformed, and was accordingly incarcerated in a room to
which access was difficult and secret. And no doubt
endless other ~host-stories rest on some basis of this sort,
for, w:1ile tile diverting practice of showing freaks in public
is a comp:;~ratively new one, freaks themselves arc among
the world's most ancient institutions, perhaps almost as
ancient as spectres and visions. It is impossible in this
place to allude to the host of less famous haunted residences,
an allusion to which their owners might take strong excep-
tion. W.B.G.M.

Hazel Tree : The Hazel w.1s dedicated to the god Thor, and,
in the Roman Catholic Church, was esteemed a plant of
great virtue for the cure of fevers. When used as a divining
rod, the rod, if it were cut on St. John's Day or Good
Friday, would be certain to be a successful instrument of
divination. A hazel rod '"'as a badge of authority, and it
was probably this notion which oaused it to be made usc of
byschoolmasters. Among the Romans, a hazel rod was also
a symbol of authority.
Bead of Bapbomet : An interesting discovery was made
publie in r8r8 dealing with the history of secret societies.
There was found, among the antiquities of the imperial
museum of Vienna some of those idols named heads of
Baphomet, which the Tcmplars adored. These heads
represent the divinity of the gnostics, named Mete or
\1\/isdom. For a long time there was preserved at Mar-
seilles one of tlte3e gilded heads. seized in a retreat of the
Templar whc:1 the latter wore pursued by the law. (See
Baphomet.)
Healing by Touch: In England and Scotland, and in France
also, the idea that a touch of the royal hand was a sure
remedy for scrofula was long prevalent, and consequently
this complaint acquired betimes the now familiar name of
" king's evil." In France, so far as can be ascertained,
this interesting practice dates from the reign of Louis IX.,
and in England from that of Edward III., who is recorded
to have performed a considerable number of cures. He
was wont to wash the aC!ected part of the sufferer, but
gradually the usc of actual ablutions was discontinued, and
tnost subsequent kings cQntented themselves with mere
touching, ;>vhile at the same time prayers were offered up on
behalf of the patient. Anon the relig10us ceremony used
on such occas10ns grew more elaborate, while, during the
reign of Henry VII., a special " king's evil " petition was
drawn up by a body of divines for insertion in the Service
Book, and there it prevailed for a surprisingly long time
thereafter, being found in some editions printed as late as
the beginning of the eighteenth century.
The idea that kings ruled by divine right emanated
mainly from Scotland, and so it is natural to assume that
the early inhabitants of that land regarded their sovereigns
as capable of miracles. There is little or no evidence,
nevertheless, that the Stuarts, prior to the Union of the
Crow.1s. 1>ro~.ctised touching !or king's evil; but scarcely
was Charles I. on the British throne ere be began to demon-
strate his powers herein, and scrofulous persons flocked
from far and near accordingly. Indeed, they came in
such numbers. that early in the fifth year of his reign,
Charles found it essential to specify certain times for their
reception at court, and the proclamation which he issued
on the subject may be read 10 the Historical Collections of
John Rushworth, sometime secretary to Oliver Cromwell.
Here it is stated that, in the future, those who 'vish to
benefit from the king•s thaumaturgic gift will be welcomed
at }tichaelmas or Easter, but it is clear that his )'lajesty
saw fit to m:;~ke exceptions to this rule, for, during his visit
to Edinburgh in r633. he ministered to numerous unfortu-
nates in the month of June. It was at Holyrood that he
received them, the palace bcin~ transformed pro tempore into
a veritable Lourdes, and Sir James Balfour, the Historian,
who was knighted at this time, and created Lyon King-at-
Arms, affirms in an unpublished manuscript, still extant in
the Advocates Library, Edinburgh, that Charles success-
fully " heallit roo persons of the cruelles or kingis eivell,
yong and olde."
Reverting to the proclamation cited above, therein the
king speaks at length of the many cures wrought by his
"royal predecessors." Now this, of course, may allude
purely to the Plantagcnets or Tudors, but it is equally
possible that these references indicate touching for scrofula
on the part of the early Stuarts, and be that as it may,
Charles I. was not the only member of that dynasty who
e!l!layed the act. John Evelyn, in his Diary, writes repeat-
edly of Charles the Second's activities \n this relation.
while Samuel Pepys refers to the same thing, and in one
passage he says the sight failed to interest him in the least,
for he had seen it often before. Clearly, then, quite a
ho>.t of the :\ferry Monarch's subjects were " heatlit" by
the royal touch, nor did the practice end with the ousting
of the Stuarts in r689. The Chevalier de St. George
essayed it on several occasions. and his son Prince Charles,
when in Scotland in r745. made at least one attempt,
though whether with success or not is unrecorded.
In the infancy of the world, and during a time when these
laws of nature were but partially known and understood
by man, it was most natural that these inexplicable powers
should be directly ascribed to a divine influence. Healing
of the sick was supposed to proceed alone from God, or
through the priest and saints His servants. Faith was
therefore necessary to the cure, and the magical powers
were therefore transferred by words, prayers, and cere-
monies, and the science was transmitted among the myster-
ies. Healing by touch, by laying on of hands, and by the
breath. belonged to this secret influence; also the usc of
talismans and amulets, which were composed of organic as
well as inorganic substances,-mincrals, stones, and plants ;
the wearing of rings, of images of saints, and other symboli-
cal objects; lastly, healing the sick by words and prayers.
As regards the semblance which this science bears to
magnetism, it is certain that not only were the ancients
acquainted with an artificial method of treating disease
but also with somnambulism itself. Among others,
Agrippa von Nettesheim speaks of this plainly when he
says, in his Occulta philosopllia, p. 451 :-" There is a
science, known but to very few, of illuminating and in-
structing the mind, so that at one step it is raised from
the darkness of i~norancc to the light of wisdom. This
is produced princtpally by a species of artificial sleep, in
which a man forgets the present, and, as it were, perceives
the future through the divine inspiration. Unbelieving
wicked persons can also be deprived of this power by
secret means."
The healiug of the sick by the touch and the laying on of
hands is to be found among primitive peoples, the Indians,
Healing 204:
the Egyptians, and especially among the Jews. In Egypt
sculptures have beon found where one hand of the operator
is placed on the stomach and the other on the back. Even
the Chinese, according to the accounts of the early mission-
aries (Athan. Kircher, Chi11a Itl11straJa), healed sickness
by the laying on of hands. In the Old Testament we find
numerous examples, of which we shall extract a few.
When )foses found his end approaching, he prayed for a
worthy successor, and we find the follow·ing passage
(Numbers, xxvii., 18, 20) :-" And the Lord said unto
Moses, Take thee Joshua. the son of Nun, a man in whom
is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon h;m." ...... And
thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that
all the congregation of the children of Israel may be
obedient.''
Another instance is to be found in the healing the seem-
ingly dead child by Elisha, who stretched -himself three
times upon the child, and called upon the Lord. The
manner in which Elisha raised the dead son of the S!luna-
mite woman is still more remarkable. He caused Gehazi
to proceed before him to lay his staff upon the face of the
child. As this was of no avail, Elisha went up into the
room, and laid himself upon the child, etc., and his hands
upon the child's bauds. so that the child's body became
warr.1 again. After that the child opened his eyes. Elisha's
powe.rs even survived his death. '· And Elisb:;, died, and
they buried him; and the bands of the ~Ioabites invaded
the land in the coming of the year. And it came to pass,
as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a
band of men : and they cast the man into the sepulchre ol
Elisha ; and when the man was let down, and touched the
bones of Elisha, be revived and stood upon his feet."
(2 Kings, xili., 20, 21). Naaman the leper, when he stood
before Elisha's house with his horses and chariots, and had
been told to wash seven times in the Jordan, said,·· Behold
I thought, he will surely come out to me, and stand, and
call upon the name of the Lord his God, and strike his
band over the place, and recover the le;n:." (2 Kings,
v. 4)-
The New Testament is particularly rich in examples of
the efficacy of laying on of the hands. " Neglect not the
gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with
the laying on of the hands ofthe presbytery." (r Timothy,
iv., I<j), is the principal maxim of the Apostles, for the
practical use of tlteir powers for the good of their brethren
1n Christ. In St. Mark we find (xvi., r8) :-" Tiley sha!l
lay hands on the sick and they shall recover." St. Paul
was remarkable for his powers: ·• And it came to pass that
~he father of Publius Lay sick of a fever and of a bloody
flux; to whom Paul entered in, and prayed and laid his
hands on him and healed him." (Acts, xxviii., 8). "And
Ananias went his way, and entered into the house, and
putting his hands on him, said, Brother Saul. the Lord,
even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou
earnest, hath sent me that thou mayest receive thy sight
and be ftlled with the Holy Gtlost. A:td i:nmediately
there fell from his eyes as it had been scales, and he re-
ceived sight." (Acts, ix., 17, 18). In St. Mark we find:-
" And they brought young children to him, that he might
touch them ; and his disciples rebuked those who brought
them. But Jesus said, ' Suffer the little children to come
unto me, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.' And he
took them up in his arms, put his bands upon them, and
blessed them." ·• And they bring unto him one that was
deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they be-
sought him to pnt his hand upon him. And he took him
aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears,
and he spit and touched his tongue; and, looking up to
heaven, he sighed, and said unto him, ' Ephphatha.'-
that is, Be opened. And straightway his ears were opened,
Healing
and the :;trin~ of his tongue was loosed. and he spake
plain." (Mark, vii., 33).
Other passages may be met with in :llatth. ix., 18;
Mark v,. 23; vi., 5; viii., 2Z; x., 13; :<vi., 18; Luke v.,
13: xviii., I5: John ix., 17; Acts ix., 17, etc., etc. In
the histories of the saints, innumerable examples are
recorded, and the command ·• In my nam:: s!lall they cast
out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall
take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it
shall not hurt them; they shall lay their hand~ on the
sick and they shall recover," applies to all true followers of
Christ. Those. however, who arc w;u!tioz in the power of
the spirit and in faith cannot perform these acts Like the
s:~.ints, on whom they cast doubts becaus~ they cannot
imitate them.
The saints accomplished t!verything through faith in
Christ, and therefore were able to perform such miracles.
We shall make mention of a few o( the most remarkabie
accounts. St. Patrick, the Irish apostle, healed the blind
by laying on his hands. St. Bernard is said to have
restored eleven blind persons to s~ght, and eighteen lame
persons to the use of their limbs, in one day at Constance.
At Cologne he healed twelve lame, caused three dumb
persons to speak, ten who were dea{ to hear; and, when
he himscli was ill, St. Lawrence and St. Benedict appeared
to him, and cured him by toaching the affected part. Even
his plates and dishes are said to have cured sickness after
his decLth. The miracles of SS. l\lat'garet, Katherine.
Elinbeth, Hilde;arde, and especially the miraculous
cures of the two holy martyrs Cosmas and Damianus,
belong to this class. Among others, they fr.:ed t.'le
Emperor Justinian from an incurable sickness. St.
Odilia embraced a leper, who was shunned by all men, in
her arms. warmed him, and restored him to health.
Remarkable above all others are those cases where
per:>ons who were at the point of death have recovered by
holy bil.ptism or extreme unction. The Emperor Constan-
tine is one of the most singular examples. Pyrrhus, king
of Epirus. had the power of assuaging colic and affections

passing hi~ gre:1t toe over them. (Plutarclt. Vita Pyrrhi:

care.:! nervous affections, lameness, and blindness, solely
bythe laying on of his hands (Suelio, Vita Ve.;pas). Accord-
ing to Coelius Sps.rtianus, Hadrian cured those afflicted
w:th dropsy by touching them with the points of his
fingers, and recovered himself from a violent fever by
similar treatment. King Olaf healed Egill on the spot by
merely laying his hands upon him and singing proverbs
(Edda, p, 216). The kings of England and Fran<;e cured
disease:; of the throat by touch. l t is said that the pious
Edw.1rd the Confessor, and in Fr<~nce that Philip the rirst,
were the first who possessed this power. The formula
used on such occasions was, •· Le roi te touche, allez at
guerissez ; " so that the word was connected with the act
of touching. In England the disease was therefore called
•· King's Evil." In France tlus power wa~ retained until
the time of the Revolution, and it is said that at the corona-
tion the exact manner of touching. and the formula- " Le
roi te touche, dieu te guerisse "-were impcLrted to the
mon:uch. In the reign of Louis XHL the Duke d'Epernon
is said to have exclaimed, wb..:n Ric!lelieu wa~ made

king nothing left but the powe: of healmg W;!US ? "

merely by th') to:tch." This he remarks especially of the
IsL'\nd of Cyprus; and later travellers confirm these cures
by the toach. I:1 ilte; times, the Salmadores and Ensal-
m:ldores or S:>ain be:o.mc very celebrated, who healed
almost all diSl:aScs by prayer, laying on of hands, and by
breathin~. In Ireland, Valentine Greatrakes (q.v.) curedat
first " Icing's evil " by touch. In the seventt>enth cen-
tury, the gardener Levret and the notorious Streeper per-
formed cures in London l>y stroking with the hand. In
similar manner cures were performed by ~·fichael Medina,
and the Child of S:dam:mca ; also ~1arcellus Empiricus
(Sprengel, Ge;ch. der ~led. Part 2, p. 179). Richter, an
inn..l<eeper at Roycn, in Silicia, cured, in the years x8x7-r8,
many thousands of sick persons in the open fields, by
touching them with his hands. Under the Popes, laying on
or hands w.1s called Chirothesy. Diepenbroek wrote two
treatises oa it, and, according to Lampe, four-and-thirty
Chirothetist<> were declared to be holy. ~Icsmer (q.v.)
and his as:>i!ltants also employed manipulation~ largely.

Heart : It is s:~.id in Ecclesiates that the h~art of the wise is
at the right side, the h~art of the foolish at the left. But
this saying must be placed in the same category as that of

know their right hand from their lelt-that is, they could
not distinguish good from evil.

Heavenly Man, The : According to the Zohar, the first of the
Sephiroth, or divine emanations. Before the creation God
was without form, above and beyond all attributes. But
when He had created the H~avenly Man He used rum as a
Chariot in which to descend. And desiring to make Him-
self known by His attributes, " Ile let Himself be styled as
the God of pardon, the God of Justice, the God Omnipotent,
the God of Hosts and He who is (]ahveh)." The Iieavenly
Ma11 is to be distinguished from the" earthly man." The
creation of the earthly man was, indeed, the work of the
Heavenly IIIan.-that is, of the first emanation from God, the
Supreme ;'.lanifcstation, the Divine activity.
Hecate : Originally a Greek goddess of uncertain parentage.
She appears to have been one of the T1tans who ruled the
heaven, earth and sea; and could bestow gifts on mortals
at pleasure. Latershe was confounded with other goddesses
until she became at length a mystic goddess having all the
magic powers of nature at command. )'lagicians and
witches besought her aid, and sacrifices were offered to her
where three ways met of dogs, honey and female black
lambs. Festival:; were celebrated to her annually at
.iEgina. In appearance she w.1s frightful, and serpents
hung hissing around her shoulders.
Heckman : (See Dee.)
Hekalot : According to the Zohar, the seven halls of the world
of Yet3irah, tlle divine halls into which the seekers for the
Chariot (Merkabah) strive to enter. Here dwell the angels,
presided over by M~tatrotl; likewise the souls of men not
specially noted for their piety. (The souls of the pious
dwell in the world of Beriah).
Hela, or " Death" : One of the offspring of Loki and the
giantess Angurbodi. The gods becoming alarmed of her
and the other monsters wrueh were coming to life in }otun-
heim, it was deemed advisable by All-father that they
should be brought before him. Hcla was cast into Ni.tl-
heim, to which are sent all those who die of sickness or old
age. She governs this world, which is composed of nine
regions, into which she distributes those "'-b.o come to her;
and in which she inhabits a strongly-protected abode.
Ni.tlheim is said to be " a dark abode far from the sun " ;
its gates open to the "cutting north " : " its walls are
formed of wreathed snakes and their venom is ever falling
like rain " ; and it is surrounded by dark and poisonous
streams. " Nidhog, the great dragon, who dwells beneath
the central root of Ygdrassil, torments and gnaws the
dead." It is said that one-half of Hela's body is livi<l, and
the other half flesh-coloured. Hunger is her table;
Starvation, her knife; Delay, her man; Slowness, her
maid ; Precipice, her threshold ; Care, her bed ; and
Burning Anguish forms the hangings of her apartments.
Heliotrope : Said to render its possessor invisible if it be
rubbed over with the juice of the herb of the same name;
stops bleeding. and averts danger from poison.
Hell : The derivation of this word is probably from the root
he/an to cover, designating a subterranean or hidden place.
In Ward's Mythology we find it in the form of Hel as a
"place of the dead " alone, by no means a place of punish-
ment. The conception of such has a more or less clear
train of evolution behind it. Tlte Christian idea of a place
of punishment was directly coloured by the Jewish con-
ception of Sheol, which in turn took shape from Babylonian
sources. When exactly the idea began to form itself as a
place of punishment is not clear, as among the ancient
Semites, Egyptians and Greeks, we find the under-world
regarded as a place of the dead alone. Thus in Egypt we
find Amenti distinctly a place of the dead, in which the
tasks of life are for the most part duplicated. This is the
case also among barbarian people, who merely regard the
land of the dead as an extension of human existence, in
which man led a more or less shadowy life. The savage
does not believe in punishment after death, and conceives
that any breach of moral rule is summarily dealt with in this
life. It is only when a higher moral code emerges from
totemic or similar rule that the idea of a place of punish-
ment is invented by priest-craft. This is, however, not
always the case: in Greece, Rome and Scandinavia, we
find that Hades was merely looked upon as a place of the
dead, where, like shadowy ghosts, mankind flit to and fro,
gibbering and squeaking as phantoms arc supposed to do.
According to the Greeks, Hades was only some twelve
feet under the surface of the ground, so that Orpheus would
have had no very long journey from the subterranean
spheres to reach earth once more. Hell is generally regarded
as a sovereignty, a place definitely ruled in an ordinary
manner by a monarch set there for the purpose by the
celestial powers. Thus the Greek Hades ruled the Sad
Sphere of the Dead ; Osiris was lord and governor of Ute
Egyptian Amcnti ; in Central America, we find 1:\vin
rulers in the Riche Hades, Xibalba, whose names arc given
as Hun-came and Vukub-came. These latter are actively
malignant, unlike the :.\IIictlan of tbe lllexican, whose empire
was for the generality of the people. These could
only exist there for the space of four years, aftet
which they finally became entirely extinct. The Mexicans
represent Mictlan as a huge monster with open mouth
ready to devour his victims, and this we find paralelled in
the Babylonian Tiawith. We thus see that at a certain
stage in all mythologies, the conception of a place of the
dead was confounded with the idea of a place of punishment.
The Greeks generally bewailed the sad end of humanity
which was condemned for ever to dwell in semi-darkness
after death. The possibility of the existence of a place of
reward never seemed to ar.peal to them. To the vivid
Greek mind life was all in al , and it was left to the finer and
altogether more upright Semitic conscience to evolve in the
near East the conception of a place of punishment. Thus
Sheol, from being regarded as a place of the dead became
the home of fire, into which the wicked and unjust were
thrust for their sins. This was certainly foreshadowed by
Babylonian and Egyptian ideals, for we find the Egyptian
unable to pass the test of justification simply rejected ;
from the idea of rejection would soon spring the idea of
active punishment. The Semitic conception of Hell was
Htll 206 Belmont
probably re-inforced on the introduction of Christianity into
Europe, and coloured by the conception of the places of the
dead belonging to the other mythologies of Europe. Thus
the Scandinavian idea, which was also that of our Saxon
forefathers, undoubtedly coloured the English conception
of the place of punishment.
" · Hela.' or • Death.' in the prose Edia, is one of the
o!Ispring of Loki and the giantess Angurbodi ; their other
hvo being the wolf Fenrir and the ;\lidgard serpent. The
gods were not lo:tg i~norant that these monsters continued
to be bred up in Jotunheim, and having had recourse to
divination, bec:."\me at<:are of all the evils they would have
to su:fer from them ; their being sprung from snch a mother
was a bad presage, and from such a sire one still worse.
All-father therefore deemed it advisable to send one of the
gods to bring them to him. \Vhen they came he threw
tue serpent into that deep ocean by which the earth is
engirdled. But the monster has grown to such an enormous
size that, holding his tail in his mouth he encircles the
whole earth. • Hela' he cast into Niflheim, and gave
her power over nine worlds (regions), into which she dis-
tributes those who are sent to her, that is to say, all who die
through sickness or old age. Here she possesses a habita-
tion protected by exceedingly high walls and strongly-
barred gates. Her hall is called Elvidner; Hunger is her
table; Starvation, her knife; Delay, her man ; Slowness,
her m:.t.id ; Precipice, her threshold ; Care, her bed ; and
Burning Anguish forms the hangings of her apartmentg.
T.be one-half of her body is livid, the other half the colour
of human flesh.' A description of Niflheim itself. the abode

IS • a dar~ abode far from the sun ' ; its gates are open to
·the cutting north'; • its walls are formed of \..-rcathed
snakes, and their venom is ever falling like rain.' It is
surrounded by the dark and poisonous streams ' Elivagar.'
~idhog, the gre:lt dragon, who dwells beneath the central
root of YgdrdSSil. torments and gnaws the dead."
The probabilities are that the ideas concerning the
Celtic other-world h~d little to do in forming the British
conception of Hell. The Br}"thonic " Annwyl" was ~er­
tainly a subterranean locality, but it was by no means a
place of punishment, being merely a microcosm of the
world above, where folk hunted, ate and drank, as in early
Britain. Nor was the Irish other-world much dillerent
and after crossing the waters of oblivion the possessed
person found himself in a sphere in many ways resemhling
the earth-life.
In southern Europe again the idea of Hell appears to
have been strongly coloured by both classical and Jewi~h
conceptions. Our best picture of the medi:cval conception
of the place of punishment is undoubtedly the Inferno of
Dante, who in most things followed the teaching of con-
temporary schoolmen in describing it. Acknowledgin~
Virgil as his ma3ter, he follows him in many descriptions of
Ta<tarus; but we find the Semitic idea cropping up every
here and there, as in the beginning of one of the cantos,
where, what looks suspiciously like a Hebrew incantation,
is set down. Tbe dramatis personae are classical; thus we
have Pluto and many of the breed of Tartarus. In later
medireval times the ingenuity of the monkish mind came
to the res~ue and conceptions which in some instancesappear
to be perfectly original sprang up. Thus, Hell obtained an
annexe, Purgatory. lts inhabitants took on a form which
may distinctively be alluded to as European, in contra-
distinction to the more satyr-like shape of the earlier
hierarchy of Hades. We find grizzly forms of bird-like
shape, with exaggerated beaks and claws, and the animal
forms and faces of later medi<eval Jaargoyles give us a
capital idea of what the denizens of Hades .seemed like in
the eyes o£ the superstition of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. It was only a modified version of these ideas
which came down to our grandfathers, and one may suspect
that such superstit;ons were not altogether disbelieved by
our fathers. This is not the pl:lce to embark upon a
theological discussion as to whether the Hell of the Christians
exists, or does not exist ; but it may he interesting to
remark that a great controversy has raged ever since the
time of Origen as to the question whether or not the punish-
ments of Hell are eternal. Those who deaied that this
was so were called Universalists, and believed in the final
redemption of all. Enough has been said to show that
most Eastern mythological systems possess a Hades which
does not differ ID any fundamental respect from that of
most barbarian races, except that it IS perhaps rather
more specialised and involved. l\Iany later writers, such
as Swedenborg, Boehme, filake and others (not to forget
Milton), have given us vivid pictures of the hierarchy and
general condition of llell. For the most part these are
based on the patristic writings. In the i\Iiddle Ages
endless controversy took place a!\ to the nature and offices-
of the various inhabitants of the place of punishment (See
Demonology), and the descriptions of later visionaries are
practically mere repetitions of the conclusions then arrived
at.
The locality of llcll ha~ also been a question of endless
speculation ; l;Ome believed it to be resident in the sun,
giving as their reason for this the f~.ct the Greek name of
that luminary llclios; but such childish etymologies
appear to have been in disfavour with most writers on the
subject, and the grand popular idea that Hell iJ subterra-
nean bas had no real rival.

Bellenbaeb, Baron : (See Germany.)
Belmont, John Baptista van, must be mnked as one of the
pioneers of science br reason of his experimental researches,
his acute judgment, his penetrating attitude of mind leading
him to say ·· i\ames do not trouble me, I contemplate the
thing in itself a.s ncar as I can," and his untir;ng search for
the truth, not for personal aggrandi~ement or power, but
in the service of progress and for the good of mankind. He
was born of a noble family in the year 1557 at Bois-le-Duc
in Brabant. Studying at Louvain, be eal'ly attained dis-
tinction in the science of mathematics, lecturing on physics
jl,t the age of seventeen. Defore he was twenty-two be had
read Hippocrates and the Greek and Arabian authors and
become eminent in the doctrines of Aristotle and Galen and
the practice of medicine according to Vopiscus and Plem-
pius. In the year l599 be took his degree of doctor of
medicine. After this some years were spent in the practice
of physic, but meeting a follower of Paracelsus he beca-me
interested in his theories of chemical medicine to such a
degree that he retired to the castle of Vilvord, near Brussels,
to spend the rest of his life in the study of experimental
chemistry on which he wrote various treatises, becoming
famous throughout Europe for his scientific knowledge.
He revolutionized medicine as known in his day, turning
aside from the theories of Galen and the Arabs, and created
an epoch in the history of physiology, being the first to
recogni7.e the functions of the stomach and its relation to
the other organs of the body. His manr and varied
experiments led him to deal with aerial fluids, to which he
gave the name of gas-carbonic acid gas being his discovery
-and it is said that without him the chemistry of steel
in all probability would have been unknown to science. .
The writings of vall Helmrmt contain many truths,
foreshadowings of ideas and principles now accepted as
indispensable commonplaces, though these almost of
necessity are hidden under much of the incomprehensible
Belvet1us 207
beliefs and illusions pr<Walent in his time. Alchemy, with
its visions of the Elixir of Life and the Philosopher's Stone
represented to him another field for experiment and
research and though he uever pretended to the ar t of
making the transmuting powder, he testified his belie£ in
the tran.smutation of metals, having seen the experiment
performed many times. Among other things he became a
firm believer in :.\Iineral and Human :.\-IagnetisJtl, anticipat-
ing :Ues:ner in almost the ·:cry terms of the later exponent
of the theory and basing his argument on the well-known
facts of the sympathy or antagonism spontaneously
arising between individuals and the influence exerted by
a firm will over a weak imagination. To the last be
declined to leave his retirement, though his fame brought
him fl.attering invitations and offers from the Emperor and
Elector Palatine. Almost unknown to his neighbours he
yet attended any stricken by illness without accepting any
fees for his services. He lived to the age of sixty-seven,
dying at his castle of Vilvord in 162.1.
Helvetius, John Frederick : A physician of the Hague who
in 1667 published a work concerning a .strange adventure
of his life in which he claimed to have taken part in a
veritable act of metallic transmutation by alchemical
processes. The book was translaLed inlo English and
published at London 1670 under the title Of a Transmuta-
t·icm. As it is one of the few exact descriptions of such an
experiment, it has been thought well to append the passage
recounting it in full, as follows :-
" On the 27th December, 1666, in the afternoon, a
stranger, in a plain, rustic dress. came to my house at
the Hague. His manner of address was honest, grave
author;tative; his stature was low, with a long face and
hair black, his chin smooth. He seemed like a native of
the north of Scotland, and I guessed he was about forty-
four years old. After saluting me he requested me most
respectfully to pardon his rude intrusion, but that his love
of the pyrotechnic art made him visit me. Having read
some of my small treatises, particularly that against- the
sympathetic powder of Sir Kenelm Digby and observed
therein my doubt of the Hermetic mystery, it caused him
to request this interview. He asked me if I still thought
there wa.s no medicine in ~ature which could cure all
diseases, unless the principal parts, as the lungs, liver, etc.
were perished, or the time of death were come. To which
I replied I never met with an adept, or saw such a medicine,
though I read of much of it and often wished for it. Then
I asked if he was a physician. He said he was a founder of
brass, yet from his youth learned many rare things in
chemistry, particularly of a friend-the manner to extract
out of metals many medicinal arcana by the use of fire.
After discoursing of experiments in metals, he asked me,
would 1 know the philosophers' stone if I saw it ? I
answered, I would not, though I read much of it in Para-
celsus, Hehnont, Basil, and others, yet I dare not say I
could know the' philosophers' matter. In the interim he
drew from his breast pocket a neat ivory box, and out of
it took three ponderous lumps of the stone, each about the
size of a small walnu t. They were transparent and of a.
pale brimstone colour, whereto some scales of the cn1cible
adhered when this most noble substance was melted. The
value of it I since calculated was twenty tons weight of
gold. When l had greedily examined and handled the
stone almost a quarter of a n hour, and heard from the
owner manv rare secrets of its admirable effects in human
and metallic bodies, also its other wonderful properties, I
returned him thi:; treasure of treasures, truly with a most
sorrowful mind, like those who coaquer themselves, yet,
as was just, very thankfully and humbly. I further desired
to know why the ~lour was yellow, and not red, ruby
colour, or purple, as the philosophers write. He answered
Helvetius
that was nothing. for the matter was mature and ripe
enough. Then I humbly requested him to beslow a little
piece of the medicine on me, in perpetual memory of him,
though but of the size of a coriander or hemp seed. He
presently answered, " Oh no, this is not lawful, though thou
wouldst give me as many ducats in gold as would fill this
room, not for the value of the metal, but for some particular
consequences. Kay, if it were possible," said he, •· that
fire could be burnt by fire, I would rather at this instant
cast all this substance into the fiercest Jlames." He then
demanded if I had a more private chamber, as this was seen
from the public street. 1 presently conducted him into
the best furnished room backw:trd, not doubting l>ut be
would bestow part thereof or some great tre~ure on me.
He entered wilhout wiping hi~ shoes, although they were
full of snow and dirt. He asked me for a little piece of
gold, and, pulling off his cloak, opened his vest, under
which he had five pieces of gold. They were hanging to a
green silk ribbon, and were of the size of breakfast plates.
This gold so far excelled mine that there was no comparison
for flexibility and colour. The inscriptions engraven upon
them he granted me to write out ; they were pious thanks-
givings to God, dated 20th August, r666, with the characters
of the Sun, i\lercury, the Moon, and the signs of Leo and
Libra.
'' I was in great admiration, and desired to know where
and how he obtained them. lie answered, •· A foreigner,
who dwelt some days in my house, said he was a lover of
this science, and came to reveal it to me. He taught me
various arts-first, of ordinary stones and chrystals, to
make rubies. chrysolites. sapphires, etc., much more valu-
able than those of the mine : a1td how in a quarter of an
hour to make oxide of iron, one dose of which would
infallibly cure the pestilential dysentery, or bloody flux;
also how to make a metallic liquor to cure all kinds of
dropsies, most certainly and in four days ; as also a limpid,
clear water, sweeter than honey, by which in two hours of
itself, in hot sand, it would extract the tiucture of garnets,
coral'>, glasses, and such like." He said more, which I
Helvetius, did not observe, my mind beiug occupied to
understand bow a. noble juicecould be drawn out of minerals
to transmute :netals. lie told me his said master caused
rim to bring a glass of rain-water, and to put some silver
lea£ into it, which was c.lissolved therein within a quarter of
an houT, like ice when heated. " Presently he drank to
me the baH, and 1 pledged him the other half, which had
not so much taste :n sweet milk, but whereby, metbought.
I became very light-heauec.l. I thereupon asked if this
were a philosophical drink, and wherefore we drank this
potion : bul he replied. 1 ought not to be so curious.''
By the said master's directions, :!. piece of a leaden pipe
being melted, he took a little sulphureous powder oul of
his pocket, put a little of iLon the point of a knife into the
melted lead, and after a great blast of the bellows, in a
short time he poured it on Lhe red stones of the kitchen
chimney. It proved most excellent pure gold, which the
stranger said brought him into such trembling amuement
th'lt he could hardly speak ; but bis roaster encouraged
him saying, "Cut for Lhyself the sixleenth part of this as
a memorial aud give the rest away among the poor."
which the stranger did, distribuling this alms, as he affirmed
if my memory fail not, at the Church of Sparenda. '' At
last," said he, •· the generous foreigner taught me thor·
oughly this divine art."
.. As soon as his relation was finished, I asked my visitor
to show me the effect of transmutation and so confirm my
faith; but he declined il for that time in such a discreet
manner that I was satisfied, he promising Lo come again il}
thtee weeks, to show me some curious arts in the fire,
provided it were then lawful without prohibition. At the
Helvetius 208 Hermes
three weeks end he came, and invited me abroad for an
hour or too. In our walk we discoursed of Nature's
secrets, but be was very silent on the subject of the great
elixir gravely asserted that it was only to magnify the
sweet fame and mercy of the most glorious God ; that few
men endeavoured to serve Him, and this be expressed as
a pastor or minister of a church; but I recalled his atten-
tion, entreating him to show me the metallic mystery,
desiringalso that he would eat, drink. and lodge at my bouse,
which I pressed, but he was of so fixed a determination
that all my endeavours were frustrated. 1 could not
forbear to tell him that I had a laboratory ready for an
experiment, and that a promised favour w:ts a kind of debt.
"Yes, true," said be," but 1 promised to teach thee at my
return, with this proviso, if it were not forbidden."
" When 1 perceived that all this was in vain, 1 earnestly
requested a small crumb of his powder, sufficient to trans-
mute a few grains of lead to gold, and at last, out of his
philosophical commiseration, he gave me as much as a
turnip seed in size, saying, " Receive this small parcel of
the greatest tre.1sure of the world, which truly few kings
or princes have ever seen or known." ··But," I said,
"this perhaps will not transmute four grains of lead,"
whereupon he bid me deliver it back to him, which, in
hopes of a greater parcel, I did, but he, cutting half off
with his nail, flung it into the fire, and gave me the rest
wrapped neatly up in blue paper, saying, " lt is yet
sufficient for thee." I answered him, indeed with a most
dejected countenance, " Sir, whnt means this ? The other
being too little. you give me now less.'" He told me to
put into the crucible ha.lf an o~nce of lead, for there ought
to be no more lead put in than the medicine can transmute.
l gave him great thanks fnr my diminished treasure, con-
centril.ted truly in the superlative degree, and put it charily
up into my little box, saying 1 meant to try it the next
day. nor would I reveal it to any. ' Not so, not so,' said
be, 'for we ought to divulge all things to the children of
art which may tend alone to the honour of God, that so
they may live in the theosophica.l truth.' I now made a
confession to him, that \vhile the mass of his medicine was
in my bands, I endeavoured to scrape away a little of it
with my nail, and could not forbear; but scratched off so
very little, that, it being picked from my nail, wrapped in a
paper, and projected on melted le~d. 1 found no transmu-
tation, but almost the whole mass sublimed. while the
remainder was a ghssy e:~.rth. At this une,..-pected account
he immediately said, .. Yl)u are more dexterous to commit
theft thi\n to apply the medicine, for if you had only
wrapped up the stolen prey in yellow wax, to preserve it
from the fumes of the lead, it would have sank to the
bottom, and transmuted it to gold; but having cast it into
the fumes, the violence of the vapour, partly by its sym-
pathetic alliance, carried the medicine quite away.' I
brought him the crucible, and he perceived a most beautiful
saffron-like tincture sticking to the sides. Ilepromi~cJ to
come next morning at nine o'clock, to show me that this
tincture woulcl tra:-~smute the lead into gold. Having
taken his leave, I impatiently awaited his ret!lrn, but the
next day he c11.me not, nor eve• since. He sent an excuse
at half-past nine that morning, and promised to come at
three in the afternoon, but I never heard of him since. I
soon began to doubt the whole matter. La.te that night
my v.·ife, who was a most curious student and inquirer
after the art, came soliciting me to malce an experiment of
that little grain o( the stone, to be assured of the truth.
• Unless this be done,' said she, • I shall have no rest or
sleep this night.' She being so earnest, I commanded afire
to be made, s:lying to myself, • T fear, 1 fear indeed, this
rn:m hath deluded me.' :\Iy wife wrapped the said matter
in w01x, and 1 cut htLif an ounce of lead, and put it into a
crucible in the fire. Being melted, my wife put in the
medicine, m:\de into a sm!t.ll pill with the wax, which
presently made a hissing noise, and in a quarter of an hour
the mass of lead was totally transmuted into the best and
finest gold, which amaxed us exceedingly. We could not
sufficiently gaze upon this admirable and miraculous work
of nature, for the melted lead, after projection, showed
on the Jire the rarest and most beautiful colours imaginable,
settling in green, and when poured forth into an ingot, it
bad the lively fresh colour of blood. When cold it shined
as the purest and most splendid gold. Truly all those who
were standing about me were exceedingly startled, and I
ran with this aurified lead, being yet bot, to the goldsmith,
who wootdered at the fineness, and after a short trial by the
test, said it was the most excellent gold in the world.
" The next day a rumour of this prodigy went about the
Hague and spread abroad, so that many illustrious and
learned persons gave me their friendly visits for its sake.
Amongst the rest, the general Assay-master, examiner of
coins of this province or 1lolland, Mr. Porelius, who with
others earnestly besought me to pass some part of the
gold through all their customary trials, which 1 did, to
gratify my own curiosity. We went to Mr. Brectel, a
silversmith, who first mixed four parts of silver ·with one
part of the gold, then he filled it, put aqt<a.fortis to it,
dissolved the silver, and let the gold precipitate to the
bottom; the solution being poured off and the calx of gold
washed with water, then reduced and melted, it appeared
excellent gold, and instead of a loss in weight, we found the
gold was increased, and had ttansmuted a scruple of the
silver into gold by its abounding tincture.
•· Doubting w:1ether the silver was now sufficiently
sepamted from the gold, we mingled it with seven parts of
antimony, which w~ melted and poured out into a cone,
and blew off the regulus on a test, where we missed eight
grains of our gold ; but after we ble'v a'vay the red of the
antimony, or superfluous scoria, we found nine grains of
gold for our eight grains missing, yet it was pale and silver-
like but recovered its full colour afterwards, so that in the
best proof of fire we lost nothing at all of this gold, but
gained, as aforesaid. These tests I repeated four times
and found it still alike, and the silver remaining out of the
acqnafortis was of the very best flexible silver that could
be, so that in the total the said medicine or elixir had
transmuted six drarM and two scruples of the lead and
silver into most pure gold."

Hermes ·rrlsmegistus ( ' the thrice greatest Hermes") : The
name given by the Greeks to t.Pe Egyptian god Tboth or
Tehuti, the god of w~sdom, learning .1nd literature. Thoth
is alluded to in later Egyptian writings as " tv.-ice very
great" and e·,eot ns •· five time.~ very great" in some
demotic or popular scripts. (ca. third century B.C.) To
him was attributed as ·• scriLe of the gods" the author-
ship of n.ll s~.crcd books which were thus called" Hermetic"
by the Greeks. These, ;.ccording to Clemens Alexandrinus
w~re Iorty-two in number and were sub-divided into six
portions, of which the first dealt with pdestly education,
the second with temple ritual and the third with geographi-
cal matter. The fourth division treated of astrology, the
fifth of hymns in honour of the gods and a text-qook for
the guidance of Kings, while the sixth was med~caL . It is
unlikely that these books were all the work of one tn<hvtdual,
and it is more pro~"!.ble that they repre~entthe accumulated
wisdom of Egypt, attribatcd in the course of ages to the
great god of wisdom.
As ·· scribe of the gods" Thoth was also the author of all
strictly sacred w:itiug. Hence by a convenient fic~on
the name of Herm~s w.1s placed at the head of an extellSlve

cycle o£ mystic literature, produced in post-Christian times.
)lost of this Hermetic or Trismegistic literature has
perished, but all that rem:Uns of it has been gathered and
translated into English. It includes the " Poimandres,"
the " Perfect Sermon," or the " Asclepius," ex:cerpts by
Stobacus, and fragments from the Church Fathers and
from the philosophers, Zosimus and Fulgentius. Hitherto
these ·writings have been neglected by theologians, who
have dismissed them as the offspring of third century Nco-
Platonism. According to the generally accepted view,
they were eclectic compilations, combining Nco-Platonic
philosophy, Philonic Judaism and Kabalistic theosophy
in an attempt to supply a philosophic substitute for,
Christianity. The many Christian elements to be found in
these mystic scriptures were ascribed to plagiarism. By
an ex:amination of early mystery writings and traditions
1t has been proved with some dC~~:ree of certainty that the
main source of the Trismegistic Tractates is the wisdom of
Egypt, and that they " go back in an unbroken tradition
of type and form and context to the earliest Ptolemaic
times."
The " Poimandres," on which all later Trismegistic
literature is based, must, at least in its origin;;! form, be
placed not later than the first century. The charge of
plagiarism from Christian writings, therefore, falls to the
ground. If it can be proved that the " Poimandres"
belongs to the first centuty, we have in it a valuable docu-
ment in determining the environment and development
of Christi:\n origins.
:\lr. G. R. S. :\lead, author of" Thrice Gre.-ttest Hermes"
says in a illuminating passage:-
.. The more one studies the best o£ these mystical ser-
mons, C3Sting aside all prejudices, and trying to feel and
think with the writers, the moreoneis conscious of approach-
ing the threshold of what may well be believed to have been
the true adytum of the best in the mystery traditions of
antiquity. Innumerable are the hints of the greatnesses
and immeosities lying beyond that threshold-among
other precious things the vision of the ·key to Egypt's
wisdom, the interpretation of apoo:alypsis by the light of
the sun-clear epoptcia of the intclli~iblc cosmos."

Herne, J. : A medium who was associated with Charles Williams
(q.v.) during a part of the latter's career and who afterwards
practised on his own account. Materialisation was a
special feature of his seances. And Miss Florence Cook
held her first materialisation seance in conjunction with
Herne. He was one of the mediums present on the occasion
of Mrs. Guppy's famous transit, and was himself on one
occasion transported in liko manner.
.Heyd : A Norwegian sea-witch or storm-fiend in the shape
of a white bear, alluded to in the saga of Grettir. With the
other storm-fiend Ham, she was sent by Helgi to engulf
Frithjof as he sailed for the island of Yarl Angantyr.
Heydon, J ohn : English Astrologer (fl.-r667). In his
useful if not invaluable Lives of the Alchemystical Philoso-
phers, Waite speaks with ~eat scorn of the English Astrolo-
ger, john Heydo11, descnbing him as no better than a
charlatan, and for that reason furnishing no facts whatso-
ever concerning his career.
The astrologer appears to have been born in r629, his
father being Francis Heydon, O\'lller of a small estate
called Sidmouth, in Devonshire. It was not in that
romantic shire, however, that the astrologer first saw the
light of day, but at a house in London boasting the pleasant
name of Green Arbour ; and after some years spent here
Heydon went to \Vorccstershire, when his education was
attended to by various clergymen. Being a clever boy, his
Heydon
parents naturally desired to send him to the University,
but this was soon rendered virtually impossible by the
outbreak of the great civil war, and thereupon Heydon took
arms on behalf of the king. and fought in several battles.
He is said to have been successful as a soldier, and to have
won to the captaincy of a troop of horse under Prince
Rupert, but on the ultimate triumph of the Roundhead
party, the young man found it advisable to leave England,
and for some years he sojourned in various countries on
the Continent, notably Spain and Turkey. Indeed, if his
contemporaneous biographers are to be trusted, he pene-
trated so far afield as Zante, the island in the Levant whose
praise has been sung so beautifullyby Edgar Allan Poe; but
by r652 Heydon was back in his native England, and in
1655 we find him studying law and established in the
Temple, a place almost sacred by virtue of its m:my
literary associations. Nor was law his only study, for
soon he was deep in that craft of astrology wherewith his
name was destined to become associated, and on one
occasion, having prophesied that Cromwell would shortly
die by hanging, he was straightway imprisoned accordingly.
So, at least, says Thomas Carte in his life of the great·
Marquis of Ormonde, that storehouse of information con-
cerning England in Stuart and Cromwellian days.
Those who take an interest in the history of medicine
wiU doubtless recall Nicholas Culpeper, who, after fighting
for the Parliament in the Civil war, devoted a wealth of
energy to compiling elaborate treatises on astrology and
pharmacopreia, arts which went hand in hand in the
seventeenth century. And it was the widow of this
Culpeper whom Heydon took to wife, the year of their
marriage being 1656, while it would seem that a daughter
was born of their union, for among the astrologers' writings
is a volume entitled Advice to a Daughter (1658). 'Whether
Heydon continued living in the Temple after his marriage
is not recorded, nor do we hear that he even attended
greatly to legal business, and it is likely, on the contrary
that astrology occupied all his time, while it appears that
that imprisonment already mentioned was not the only
one he suffered. He became intimate with many of the
great scientists of the Restoration. but quarrelled with a
number of them too ; while, though he always maintained
that he was not actually affiliated with the Rosicrucians,
it is a. fact that he explained their theories publicly. Little
is known about his later years, while the date of his death
is unknown, and. before turning to the subject of his
writings, it only behoves to state that his portrait was
engraved by Thomas Cross.
Mr. Waite declares that Heydon's writings are sorry
pastiches, and it cannot be questioned that the bulk of his
work is derivative, Sir Thomas Browne being one whom
he apes varticularly. Nevertheless Heydon must be
credited wtth considerable assiduity, and his Rosicrucian
books alone are numerous, the best of them being probably
The New Method of Rosic·Crucian Physick (1658), The
Rosie-Cmcian Infallible Axiomater (I66o), The Wise Man's
Crown, or The Glory of the Rosie-Cross (1664), and The
Rosie-Cross Uncovered (t66z). In addition to them he
was author of Theomagia or The Tempk of Wisdom (r664),
and The Prophetic Trumpeter, soundit1g an Allarum to
England (1655), the latter being dedicated to Henry Crom·
well, while according to 'Wood's Athena~ Oxo11icsis, Heydon
was likewise the compiler of A Rosiecrucian Theological
Dictionary. Yet another book from his pen was Idea of
the Law, and at the end of this we find advertisements of
several works of his, probably pamphlets, none of which
is known to exist nowadays, but whose titles are worth
recordin{{ here. One is calllld The Fa1mliar Spirit, another
The Way to Co1werse with Angtls, while the others are A
New Method of Astrology, Of Scatldalous Nati1tities, and
Bharis 210
Cabballa, or tl~e Artoy whic/1 llfoses at:d Elijah did so many
Miracles. It is quite possible, of course. that these pam·
phlets were advertised while yet in course of preparation,
and that the author was prevented from bringing them to
a finish, but their titles are significant, showing how far
Heydon waded into the sea of mysticism, and suggesting
that he was really more erudite therein than Mr. Waite
imagines.

Direcl writing, though uequently produced at s~ances, IS

dames' maids were wont to set a bowl of milk for him for
his pains in grinding of malt and mustard, and sweeping the
house at midnight. This white bread, and bread and
milk, was his standard fee." He is perhaps best known in
Britain by his appellation of Puck, and hi~ qualities and
attributes are represented under this name in Shakespeare's
" l\!idsumm'er's Night's Dre."lm." By some he is believed
to be the demon wbo leads men astray during the night.

Spiritualistn.-Since the introduction of spiritualism into
Jlolland, in r857- 8, no small part of its history has been
Hollancl
enacted in that country, notwithstanding that the phleg-
matic and. by no means impressionable temperament of the
Dutchman would seem to make but an indifferent medium
of him. The first Dutch spiritualist of whom we have-
record is one]. N. T. Marthese, who, after studying psychic
phenomena in foreign countrie!., finally returned to his
native Holland, bringing with him the American medium
Home. The latter held slances at the Hague, before
several learned societies, and by command of Queen
Sophia, a slance was given in her presence. The medium
himself, in an account of the performance, tells us that the
royal lady was obliged to sit out seven slanus, on con-
secutive evenings, before any results were obtained. These
results, however, were apparently satisfactory, for the
Queen was thereafter a staunch supporter of the movement.
During Home's visit, spiritualism gained a considerable
hold on the people of Hollat~d, and the practice of giving
small private slances became fairly wide-spread. Spirit
voices were heard at these jfatherings. the touch of spirit
hands was felt, and musicalmstruments were played upon
by invisible performers. Particularly were these seances
appreciated which were held at the house of Mr. 1'. D. Van
Herwerden, in the Hague, and which were attended by
many enthusiastic stuuents o! spiritualistic phenomena.
His medium was, as a rule, a Japanese boy of his household,
about fourteeo years old, and very ignorant. The mani-
festations ranged from spirit rapping and table turning in
the earlier .~catzces to form materialisation in those of a.
later date. One of the principal spirits purported to be a
monk, Paurellus, who had been assassinated some three
hundred years previously in that city. Afterwards Mr.
Van Herwerden was induced by his friends to publish his
diary, under the title of Experie•zces a•zd Conzmtmications
on a still Mysterious Territory. For a time, as has been
said, spiritualistic siances were only conducted in family
circles, and were of a quite private nature. But as the
attention o! the intellectuals became more and more
directed to the new science, societies were fonned to pro-
mote research, and to throw light upon that which v.·as
obscure and perplexinp,- The first of these was the society
called the " Oromase, ' or Ormuzd, which was founded by
Major J . Re,•ius, a friend of Marthese, in 1859, and which
included among its numbers many people of high repute.
They met at the Hague. and the records of their transactions
were carefully preserved. Major Revius was president
and continued to act in that capacity till 187i, the year of
his death. The society's secretary, A. J. Rita, was also a
prominent worker in " the cause." The '" Oromase "
library contained a fine collection of works on spiritualism,
mesmerism, and kindrecl subjects, and included American.
French, German and English books. Another society,
the " Veritas," was founded in Amsterdam in x86g. The
studies o! this latter association were conducted in a some·
what less searching and scientific spirit than those of the
" Oromase." Its mediums specialized in trance utterances
and written communications from the spirits, and its
members inclined to a belief in re-incarnation, which was
at variance with the opinions of the older society. Rotter-
dam had, for a time, a society with similar objects known
as the " Research after Truth," but it soon c'l.me to an end,
though its members continued to devote themselves
privately to the investigation of spirit phenomena. Other
equally short-lived societies were !ormed in Haarlem and
other towns. In all of these, however, there was a dearth
of mediums able to produce form materializations, and to
supply the want a number of foreign mediums hastened to
Holland. Hitherto the comparatively private nature ot
the sea11css, and the high standing of those who took part
in them. had prevented the periodicals from making any
but the most cautious comments on the seances. But the
Holly 211 Hopkins
advent of professional mediums on tbe scene swept away
the barrier and let loose a flood of journalistic ridicule and
criticism. This in turn provoked the supporters of spirit-
ualism to retort, and soon a lively battle was in progress
between the spiritualists and the sceptics. The con-
sequence was, that .. the cause " was boomed as much by
the articles which derided it as by those which were in
favour of it. Such mediums as ;\Irs. Margaret Fox Kane,
the Davenport brothers, Rita, Home, Miss Cook, and
Henry Slade, came over to Holland. Writers arose who
were prepared to devote their abilities to the defence of
spiritualism. Such an one was Madame Elise van Calcar,
who not only wrote a novel expounding spiritualistic
principles, but also conducted a monthly journal " 0::~. the
Boundaries of Two Worlds," and held a sort of spiritualistic
salon, where enthusiasts could meet and discuss their
favourite subject. Dr. H. de Grood, Dr. ]. Van Velzen,
Dr. Van der Loef, Herr SchimmP.l, are among the other
prominent Dutch authors who wielded their pens in defence
of the same opinions. The writings of Professors Varley,
Crookes, and Wallace were translated into the Dutch Lan-
guage, and lecturers helped to spread the belief in com-
munkation with the Other World. A mesmerist, Signor
Donata, carried on the practice of " Animal Magnetism "
in Hollatzd, and endeavoured to identify the magnetic
force emanating from the operator with the substance of
which disembodied spirits are composed. ·Many exposures
were made of unscrupulous mediums, and these, naturally,
cast discredit upon the entire movement. But on the
whole the mediums, professional or otherwise, were well
received. Such phases of psychic phenomena as haunted
houses and poltergeists arc also very common, but are so
similar to these manifestations in other countries that they
require no separate treatment.
Holly : This name is probably a corruption of the word
•· holy " as this plant has been used from time immemorial
as a protection against evil influence. It was bung round,
or planted near houses, as a protection against lightning.
Its common use at Christmas is apparently the sun;val
of an ancient Roman custom, occurring during the festival
to Saturn, to which god the holly was dedicateO.. While
the Romans were holding this feast, which occurred about
the time of· the winter solstice, they decked the outsides of
their houses with /l(llly ; at the same time the Chr~tians
were quietly celebrating the birth of Christ, and to avoid
detection, they outwardly followed the custom of their
heatl~en neighbours, and decked their houses with hollyalso.
In th1s way the holly came to be connected with our Christ-
mas customs. This -plant was also regarded as a symbol of
the resurrection. Tbe use of mistletoe along with holly is
probably due to the notion that in winter the fairies took
shelter under its leaves, and that they ?rotectcd all who
sheltered the plant. The origin of k1ssing under the
mistletoe is considered to have come from our Saxon
ancestors, who regarded this plant as dedicated to Freya,
the god!lcss of love.
Holy Trinity Church, York : (See Haunted H.ouses).
Home, Daniel Dunglas (1833- 1886): One of the best known
of spiritualistic mediums, was born near Edinburgh in
1833.. At the a~e of nine he was taken by his aunt to
Amenca, where 10 1850 he became a convert to the new
doctrine of spiritualism and himself developed mediumistic
P?wers.. The next five years saw him occupied in giving
se_anccs 1n Ne~ York and elsewhere. In 1855 some of his
friends subscnbcd a sum of money to send him to Europe.
In England his sc<ances were attended by many notable
people, and on the Continent also he was admitted into the
highest society. Until 1859 be had subsisted on the
bounty of his wealthy friends-for at no time did be take
actual fees for his senoiccs-but in that year he married a
Russian lady of noble birth, young, charming, and possessed
of means. But on her death in 1862 his financial circum-
stances were altered again. Four years later he was
adopted bya wealthy widow, Mrs. Lyon, who made him large
money gifts. In a few months, however, she tired of her
adopted son and sued him in the law courts for the recovery
of her '' gifts." The charge of fraud was not proved, and
many distinguished persons filed affidavits testifying to the
actuality of Home's mediumistic powers, but the court was
not satisfied that he bad not influenced Mrs. Lyon, and
judgment was given in her favour. During all this time he
had largely exercised his faculties as a medium, and in
187o-72 he held a series of sittings with Sir William Crookes
In 1871 he married again, and for the second time his wife
was a Russian lady of means. From 1872 onwards he
lived mostly on the Continent, where he died in 1886, after
a long and painful illness. llome's mediumship presents
many remarkable features. His s£ances were productive
of both trance and physical phenomena, the latter including
raps and table-tilting, levitation and elongation, matcrialisa-
tion, t.he fire-ordeal, and practically every form of manifes-
tation. Unlike other mediums, he wa.'l nt!ver detected in
fraud, though his mcdiumship was spread over so many
years, and his phenomena arc among the best-attested in
the records of spiritualism. But a more important factor in
Home·s success was his wonderful personality. Though
of lowly birth, he early acquired an case and charm of
manner \vbich fitted him for the good society wherein he
was destined to move. Artless and spontaneous and very
affectionate, of pleasing manners and generous disposition,
he won the hearts of all with whom he came in contact,
and inspired in his sitters an emotional confidence which
seems frequently to have over-ruled their judgment. Sir
'iV. Croolces said of him that he was ·'one of the most
lovable of men,'' whose " perfect genuineness and upright-
ness were beyond suspicion." vVbetbcr a medium should
ever be " beyond suspicion" to a scientific investigator
is, of course, open to C!uestion, but the instance shows
abundantly that even setenbsts are not immune from the
influence of personal ma~tlelism.
Homuneulas: An artificial man supposed to have been made
by the alchemists, and especially by ParacP.lsus. To
manufacture one, l.tc lotatcs that the needful spagyric
substances should be taken and shut up in a glass phial,
and afterwards be placed to digest in horse-dung for the
space of forty days. At the end of this time, there will be
something which will begin to move and live in the bottle.
This something is a man, but a man who has no body and
is transparent. Nevertheless, he exists, and nothing
remains but to bring him up-which is not more difficult
to do than to make him. You may accomplish it by daily
feeding him-during forty weeks, and without extricating
him from his dung-hill-with the arcanum of human
blood. At the end of this time you shall have a veritable
living child, having every member as well-proportioned
as any infant born of a woman. He will only be much
smaller than an ordinary child, and his physical education
·will require more care and attention.
Hopedale Community : A socialistic and religious community
founded in 1842 near Milford in Massachusetts, by the
Rev. Adin BaLian. In 1850 various spirit manifestations
made their appearance in the Community, while on the
death of its founder in r 852, communications of a spiritual-
istic cast, purporting to come from him, were received
through the hand of a living member of the Commutzity.
Tbe little band at Hopedale did a good deal to help the
advance of Spiritualism.
Hopkins, Matthew: Called the witchfinder; fiourished in
1640. Of him Godwin says, "Nothing can place the
credulity of the English nation on the subject ofwitchcraft
Hopkins 212
in a more striking point of view, than the history of ,'\1/allhew
Hopkins, who, in a pamphlet published in 1647 in his own
vindication, assumes to himself the surname of the \\'itch-
finder. He feU by accident, in his native country of
Suffolk, into contact with one or two reputed witches, and,
being a man of an observing turn and an ingenious invention,
struck out for himself a trade, which brought lum such
moderate returns as sufficed to maintain him, and at the
same time gratified his ambition by making him a terror
to many, and the object of admiration and gratitude to
more, who felt themselves indebted to him for ridding them
of secret and intestine enemies, ~gainst whom, as long as
they proceeded in ways that left no footsteps behind, they
felt they had no possibility of cuarding themselves."
After hvo or three successful experiments, Hopkins en-
gaged in a regular tour of the countries of Norfolk, Suffolk,
Essex and Huntingdonshire. He united to him two con-
federates, a man named John Stern, and a woman whose
name bas not been banded down to us. They visited
every town in their route that invited them, and secured to
them the moderate remuneration of twenty shillings and
their expenses, leaving what was more than this to the
spontaneous gratitude of those who should deem themselves
indebted to the exertions of Hophi11s and his party. By
this expedient they secured to themselves a favourable
reception and a set of credulous persons who would listen
to their dictates as so many oracles. Being three of them,
they were enabled to play the game into one another's
hands, and \vere sufficiently strong to o,·erawe all timid
and irresolute opposition. In every town to which they
came, they inquired for reputed witches, and having taken
them into custody, were secure for the most part of a
certain number of zealous abettors, and took care tl:tat
they should have a clear sta~e for their experiments. They
overawed their helpless vtctims with a certain air of
a.uthority, as if they had received a commission from heaven
for the discovery of misd::eds. They assailed the poor
creatures with a multitude of questions constructed in
the most artful manner. They stripped them naked. in
search for the devil's marks 1n different parts of their
bodies, which they ascer~ined by running pins to the
head into those parts, that, if they were genuine marks,
would prove themselves such by their insensibility. They
swam their victims in rivers and ponds, it being an un-
doubted fact, that, if the persons accused were true witches
the water, which was the symbol of admission into the
Christian Church, would not rect'ive them into its bosom.
1f the persons examined continl'ed obstinate, they seated
them in constrained and uneasy attitudes, occasionally
binding them \\'ith cords, and compelling them to remain
so without food or sleep for twenty-four hours. They
walked them up and down the room, two taking them
under each arm, till they dropped down with fatigue. They
carefully swept the room in which the experiment was
made, that they might keep away spiders and flies, which
were supposed to be devils or their imps in that disguise.
The most plentiful inquisition of Hopkir.s and his con-
federates 'vas in the years 1644, 1645, and 1646. At length
there were so many persons cbmmitted to prison upon
suspicion of witchcraft, that the government was com-
pelled to take in band the affnir. The rural magistrates
before whom Hopkins and his confederates brought their
victims, were obliged, willingly or unwillingly, to comm;t
them for trial. A commission was granted to the earl of
Warwick and others to hold a sessionof jail-deliveryagainst
them for Essex at Chelmsford. Lord \~'arwick was at this
time the most popular nobleman in England. He was
apJ?ointed by the parliament lord high admiral during the
civtl war. He was much courted by the independent
clergy, was shrewd, penetrating and active, and exhibited
Horse Shoes
a singular mixture of pious demeanour with a vein of
L"lcetiousness and jocularity. With him was sent Dr.
Calamy, the most eminent divine of the period oi the
Commonwealth, to see (says Baxter) that no fraud was
committed, or wrong done to the parties accused. It may
well be doubted, however, whether the presence of this
clergy!JUn did not operate unfa.vo;;~rably to the persons
suspected. He preached before the judges. It may
readily be believed, considering the temper of the times,
that he insisted much upon the horrible nature of the sin
of witchcraft, which could expect no pardon, either in the
world or the world to come.
He sat on the bench with the judges, and participated in
their deliberations. In the result of this inquisition sixteen
persons were hanged at Yarmouth in Norfolk, fifteen at
Chelmsford, and sixty at various places in the county of
Suffolk. Whitlocke 1n his Memorials of English Affairs,
under the date of 1649, speaks of many witches being
apprehended about Newcastle, upon the information of a
person whom he calls the Witch-finder, who, as his experi-
ments were nearly the same, though he is not named, we
may reasonably suppose to be Hopkin~; and in the follow-
ing year about Boston in Lincolnslure. In 1652 and 1653
the same author speaks of women in Scotland, who were
put to incredible torture to extort from them a confession
of what tl1eir adversaries imputed to them.
The fate of Hopkins was such as might be expected in
similar cases. The multitude are at first imoressed with
horror at the monstrous charges that are adva;1ced. They
are seized, as by contagion, with terror at the mischiefs which
seem to impend over them, and from which no innocence
and no precaution appear to afford them sufficient protec-
tion. They hasten, as with an unanimous effort, to avenge
themselves upon these malignant enemies, whom God and
man alike combine to expel from society. But, after a
time, they begin to reflect, and to apprehend that they
have acted with too much precipitation, that they have
been led on with uni:ertain appearances. They see one
victim led to the gallows after another, without stint or
limitation. They see one dying with the most solemn
asseverations of innocence, and another confessing apparent-
ly she knows not what, what is put into her mouth by her
relentless persecutors. They see these victims old, crazy
and impotent, harassed beyond endurance by the ingenious
cruelties that are pract!sed against them. They were
first urged on by implacable hostility and fury, to be
satisfied with nothing but blood. But humanity and
remorse also have their tum. Dissatisfied with themselves,
they arc glad to point their resentment against another.
The man that at first they hailedas a public benefactor, they
presently come to regard with jealous eyes, and begin to
consider as a cunning imposter, dealing in cool blood with
the lives of his fellow-creatures for a paltry gain, and,
still more horrible, for the lure of a perishable and short-
lived fame. The multitude, we are told, after a few
seasons, rose upon Hopkim and resolved to subject him to
one of his own criterions. They dragged him to a pond
and threw him into the water for a witch. It seerns he
floated on the surface, as a witch ought to do. They then
pursued him with hootings and revilings, and drove him
for ever into that obscurity and ignominy which he had
amply merited.

Bors&-Whispering 213 Howitt
Horse-Whispering : A secret method by which certain persons
arc able to acquire power over refractory hCirses. As is
well known to students of gypsy lore, that interesting
people appear to be in possession of some secret by which
they are enabled to render vicious horses entirely tame;
and opinions are divided as to whether this secret consists
in the application of a certain odour or balm to the horse's
muzzle, or whispering into its ear a spell or incantation.
It is said, indeed, that the gypsy horse-charmer applies
aniseed to the nose of the animal. But besides being
practised by gypsies, llqyse-wllispering is in vogue amongst
many other peoples. Camden in his Recital of lYisll
Superstitions says :-" It is by no means allowable to
praise a horse or any other animal unless you say • God
save him.' If any mischance befalls a horse in three days
after, they find out the person who commended him, that
he may whlsper the Lord's Prayer in his right ear." It
\'las said by Con Sullivan, a famous Irish horse-whisperer
of the eighteenth century, that it is out of the power of the
professors of the art to explain the source of their influence,
-the same thing being affirmed by those.who practise it
in South America, where a couple of men will tame half a
dozen wild horses in three days. The same art is widely
practised in Hungary and Bohemia, and it was from a
Bohemian gypsy that a family in the county of Cork
claimed to hold a secret by whlch the wildest or most
vicious horse could be tamed. For generations this secret
was regularly transmitted as a parting legacy at the time
of death from the father to the eldest son.
Throughout the North of Scotland there are disseminated
members of a secret society for the breaking in of refractory
horses, which is believed to be called the Horseman's
Society, and which purports to be able to trace its origin
away back into the dark ages Those only are admitted
who gain their livelihood by the care and management of
horses, and the more affiuent and better educated are
jealously excluded. Many farmers entertain a prejudice
attainst the members of the society, but they are forced to
admit that they are always very capable in the manage-
ment of their teams, and can perform services which would
otherwise require the ~ailing in of a veterinary surgeon.
-:t:hey arc usually skilled in the knowledge of heros and
s1mples, and a great deal of the marvellous is imputed to
them. In fact it is stated that they hold their meetings
at night and in the clear moonlight, going through various
equestrian performances with horses borrowed for the
occasion from their masters' stables. There is further
said to be an inner circle in the society, where the black
art and all the spells and charms of witchcraft are the
objects of study, and the members of which can smite the
horses and cattle with mysterious sicknes>, and even cast
a glamour over human bein~s. Indeed a local writer goes
so far as to say that the mner circle of the Horsemen
employ hypnotic influence both on men and animals, as it
is said certain North-American Indians, and some of the
~ungle tribes of Hindustan, do.
The famous Con Sullivan has already been alluded to,
and his achievements were really wonderful. On one
occ'\~ion his services were requisitioned by Colonel Westenra
afterwards Earl of Rosml)re, who possessed a racehorse
called " Rainbow," of the most savage description, which
would attack any jockey courageous enough to mount him
by seizing him by the leg with his teeth, and dragging
him from the saddle. A friend of the Colonel's told him
that he knew a person who could cure Rainbow, and a
'"agcr of £I,ooo wa'l laid on the matter. Con Sullivan,
who was known throughout the countryside as " The
'~pcrer ·: was sent for, and after being shut up alone
\nth the aru~al for a quarter of an hour, he gave the signal
for the ad!IUSSion of those who had been waiting on the
result. When they entered, they found the horse extended
on his back, playing like a killen with Sullivan, who was
quietly sitting by him ; but both horse and operator
appeared exhausted, and the latter had to be revived with
brandy. The horse was perfectly tame and gentle from
that da}'· Another savage steed named " King Pippin"
took an entire night to cure, but in the morning he was
seen following Sullivan like a dog, lying down at the word
of command, and pcrmittiot; any person to put his band
into his mouth. Shortly afterwards be won a race at the
Curragh. Sullivan is described by one w~o knew him
well as an ignorant rustic of the lower class, but there
can be no question as to his extraordinary powers.
The statement of Sullivan is probably correct, that the
successful whisperer is not acquainted with the secret of
his own power. " The reason," says Rich, " is obvious.
A force proceeding immediately from the 'viii or the in-
stinctive life would be impaired by reflection in the under-
standing and broken up or at least diminished by one half.
The violent trembling of the animal under this operation is
like the creaking and shivering of the tables before they
begin to ' tip,' and indicates a moral or nervous force
acting physically, by projection perhaps from the spirit of
the operator. None of these cases are, after all, more
wonderful than the movement of our own limbs and
bodies by mental force, for how does it move them with
such ease ? And may not the same power that places its
strong but invisible little fingers on every point of our
muscular frames, stretch its myriad arms a little further
into the sphere around us, and operate by the same laws,
and with as much ease, on the stalwart frame of a horse. or
even a clothes-horse ? "

House of Wlsdom : The tarik or " path" of the Hozm of
Wisdom was founded by Moslem mystics at Cairo in the
ninth century, and had seven initiatory degrees. The
original founder appears to have been one Abdallah, a
Persian, who, believing in the Gnostic doctrine of the
Aeons or Sephircrtbs, applied the system to the successors
of Mohammed, stating that lsmael was the founder of his
tarik and one of his descendants as the seventh Imaum. He
establisbetl an active system of propaganda and sent
missionaries far and wide. He was succeeded in his office
as chief of the society by his son and grandson. After
the institution had been in existence for some time it was
transferred to Cairo, and assemblies were held twice a
week, when all the members appeared clothed in white.
They were gradually advanced through the seven degrees
of which the tarik consisted, and over wh.ich. a Dai-al-doal
or " Missionary of missionaries " presided. A later chief,
Hakem-bi-emir-Illah, increased the degrees to nine, and
in 1004 erected a stately borne for the society, which he
elaborately furnished with mathematical in.~truments. As
the institution did not meet with the approval of the
authorities, it was destroyed in I 123 by the then Grand
Vizier, but meetings continued elsewhere. The officers of
the society were :-Sheik, Dai-el-keber, or Deputy, Dai, or
Master, Refik, or Fellow, Fedavie, or Agent, Lassik, or
Aspirant, Muemini. or Believer. Tile teaching was to the
effect that there had been seven holv Imaums, that God
bad sent seven Lawgivers, who bad each seven helpers, who
in tum had each twelve aposUes. (See Assassins.\

Huet Pierre-Daniel: A celebrated bishop of Avrenches, who
we'd in I72I. One finds in his Remi..isunces many inter-
esting passages relating to the vampires by the Greek
Archipelago. " Many strange things," he says "are told
of the broucolagnes, or vam~ires of the Archipela~o. It
is said in that country that 1f one leads a wicked life, and
dies in sin, he will appear again after death as he was wont
in his lifetime, and that such a person will cause great
affright among the living." liu~t believed that the bodi~s
of such people were abandoned to the power of the devil,
who retained the soul within them for the vexation of
mankind. Father Richard, a Jemt, employed on a
mission in these islands, provided Huet with details of
many cases of vampirism. In the Island of St. Erini, the
Thera of the ancients occurred one of the greatest chapters
in the history of vampirism. He says that these people
were tormented by vampires, that they were constantly
disinterring corpses for the purpose of burning them
Httet states that this evidence is worthy of credence as
emanating from a witness of unimpeachable honesty, who
has had ocular demonstrations of what he writes about.
He furUler says that the inhabitants of these islands after
the death of a person, cut off his feet, hands, nose, and
ears, and they call this act acf'okriazein. They hang all
these round the elbow of the'dead. It is noteworthy that
the bishop appears to think that the modern Greeks may
have inherited the practice of burning bodies from their
fathers in classical times, and that they imagine that unless
the corpse is given to the flames, all cannot be well with
the soul of the deceased.

Huns : The ancient historians credited the Huns with a
monstrous origin. They were often called children of the
tkvil, because it was said that they were born of a union
between demons and hideous witches, the latter cast out of
their own county by Philimer, king of the Goths, and his
army. The olrl writers state that the Huns were of horrible
deformity, and could not be mistaken for anything but
the children of demons. Besoldus. following Servin, claims
that their name of Huns comes from a Celtic or barbaric
word signifying great ma!ficians. Many stories are told of
their magic prowess. and of their raising spectres to assist
them in battle.
Hydromaney: Divination by water, is said by Natalis Comes
to have been the invention of Ncreus, and according to
Delrio, a most respectable authority in these matters, it is
a method of divination than which nulla j(Jicundior im-
postm•is. lamblichus, he says, mentions one kind of
hydromancy to which the Emperor Andronicus Comnenus
had recourse ; not in person, for regard for his character
(a character richly demanding such caution !) forbarle this
humiliation. This worthy applied to Sethos, a diviner,
who from his youth upward !Jad been addicterl to magic,
ann on that account had been deprived of sight by the
Emperor Manuel. The question proposed by h)'dromancy
was, who was to be the successor of Androniclls, .a doubt
which grievously perplexed the superstitious tyrant, and
left him in hesitation as to the fittest victim whom his
suspicious venge?.nce might first sacrifice. The evil spirit
when summoned, showed upon the water the letters S.I., and
upon being asked at what time the person so designated
should succeed, he replied, before the Feast of the exalta-
Hydromancy
tion of the Cross. His prediction was verified, for, within
the timevnamed, Isaac Angelus had thrown Andronicus to
be torn in pieces by the infuriated populace of Constantin-
ople. It should be remembered here that the devil spells,
as he repeats the Lord's Prayer, not in the natural order, but
backwards. S.I., when inverted, would fairly enough
represent Isaac, according to all laws of ma~c.
The same story is related with great spint by Nicetas.
The arts with which the tempter cheats the ear of his
votary arc vividly displayed, and there is one very pic-
turesque touch, when the fiend is asked respecting time,
which we arc. surprised should have escaped Delrio, who
evidently borrows from this source, though he refers to
Jamblichus. The annalist bas already remarked that he
neither knows, nor indeed wishes to know, the method of
practising hydromancy, but Delrio, on the contrary,
describes several kinds. In one a ring was suspended by a
thread in a vessel of water, and this being shaken, a judg-
m.ent was formed according to the strokes of the ring
against the sides of the vessel. In a second, three pebbles
were thrown into standing water, and observations were
drawn from the circles which they formed. A third
depended upon the agitations of the sea, whence the
learned Jesuit deduces a custom prevalent among the
Oriental Christians of annually baptizing that element; at
the same time taking especial care to show that the be-
trothment of the Adriatic by the Doge of Venice has a
widely different origin. A fourth divination was taken
from the colour of water, and certain figures appearing in
it, which Varro says afforded numerous prognostics of the
event of the Mithridatic War. But this branch was of
sufficient importance to deserve a separate name, and we
read accordingly of divination by fountains, these being
the waters most frequently consulted. Among the most
celebrated fountains for this purpose were those of Palicorus
in Sicily, which invariably destroyed the criminal who
ventured to adjure them falsely in testimony of his inno-
cence. A full account of their usage and virtue is given
by Macrobius. Pausanias has described a fountain near
Epidaurus, dedicated to Ino, into which on her festival,
certain loaves were wont to be thrown. It was a favourable
omen to the applicant if these offerings were retained ; ou
the other hand, most unlucky if they were washed up
again. So, also, Tiberius cast golden dice into the fountain
of Apomus, near Padua, where they long remained as a
proof of the imperial monster's good fortune in making the
highest throw. Several other instances of divining springs
may be found collected by the diligence of Boissard ; and
to a belief in them Delrio thinks a custom of the ancient
Germans is referable, who threw their new-born children
into the Rhine, with a conviction that if they were spurious
they would sink, if legitimate they would swim. In a
fifth method, certain mysterious words were pronounced
over a cup full of water, and observations were made upon
its spontaneous ebullition. In a sixth, a drop of oil was
let fall on water in a glass vessel, and this furr:ished as it
were a mirror upon wlticlt many wonderful objects became
visible. This, says Delrio, is the Modus Fessatzus. Clemens
Alexandrinus is cited for a seventh kind, in which the
women of Germany watched the sources, whirls, and
courses of rivers, with a view to prophetic interpretation ;
the same fact is mentioned by Vives in his Commentary
upon St. Augustim. In modern Italy, continues the
learned Jesuit, diviners are still to be found who write the
names of any three persons suspected of theft upon a like
number of little balls, which they throw into the water
and some go to so profane an extent as to abuse e,·cn holy
water for this most unsanctified purpose. Boissard, as
cited above, bas explained more fully than Delrio two of
these methods of hydromancy, that by the ring suspended
Bydromaney 215 Bypermsthesla
in a vessel of water, and the method by its spontaneous
ebullition. A very similar account is given by Wierus.
In a fragment of Varro's book, de Cultu Deorum, the
practice of hydronzanq is attributed to Numa. Upon this
statement St. Augustine has commented in the passage to
which we have already referred, and he mentions that the
practice of l1ydromancy was attributed by Varro to the
Persians, and afterwards to the philosopher Pythagoras.
Strabo in like manner has ascribed the practice to the
Persians.
Hydromancy is, in principle, the same thing as divination
by the crystal or mirror, and in ancient times a natural
basin of rock kept constantly full by a running stream,
was a favourite medium. The double meaning of the
word " reflection " ought here to be considered, and how
.gazing do'vn into clear water, the mind is disposed to
self-retirement and to contemplation, deeply ti.nctured with
melancholy. Rocky pools and glomy lakes figure in all
stories of witchcraft-witness the Craic-pol-nain in the
Highland woods of Laynchork : the Devil's Glen in the
county of Wicklow, Ireland; the Swedish Blokula; the
witch mountains of Italy; and the Bibiagora, between
Hungary and Poland. Similar resorts in the glens of
Germany were marked, as Tacitus mentions, by salt springs ;
for this again there was an additional good reason, which
would carry us far from the present subject to explain.
It was really only aoother form of divination by the
gloomy \Vater pool that attracted so much public attention
at tba~ t~me, when Mr. Lane, in his work on i\llodern
Egypt testified to its suC<'ess as practised in Egypt and
1lindostan. That gentleman having rcsolv<'d to witness
the performance of this species of sorcery, the magician
commenced his oper~tions by writing forms of invocation
to his familiar spirits on six slips of paper, a chafing dish
with some live charcoal in it was then procured, and a boy
summon~ wh? had not yet reached the age of puberty.
Mr. Lane mqUired who were the persons that could see in
the fluid mirror, and was told that they were a boy not
arrived at puberty, a virgin, a black female slave, and a
pregnant woman. To prevent any collusion between the
sorcerer and the boy, Ur. Lane sent his servant to take
the first boy he met. When nII was prepared, the sorcerer
threw some incense and one of the strips of paper into the
chafing-dish ; be then took hold of the boy's right hand,
and drew a square with some mystical marks on the palm :
in the centlc of the square he poured a little ir.k, which
forml'd the magic mirror, and d~ired the boy to look
steadily into it without raising his head. In this mirror
t!Je boy declared that he saw, succeS&ively, a man sweeping,
seven men wltb flags, an army pitching its tc:-nts, and the
various officers of state attending on the Sultan. The
re'lt must be told by Mr. Lane himself.
"The sorcerer now addressed himself to me, and asked
me ii I wished the boy to see any person who was absent or
dead . I named Lord Nclsou, of whom the boy bad evi-
.dently never heard, for it was with much difficulty that he
pronounced the name after several trials. The magician
desired the boy to say to the Sultan,' My master salutes thee
and desires thee to bring Lord Nelson ; bring him before
my eyes that I may see him speedily.' The boy then said
so, and a)most immediately added, ' A messenger has gone
and brought back a man dressed in a black (or rather,
dark blue) suit of European clothes ; the man has .lost
his left arm.' He then paused for a moment or two, and
looking more inteatly and more closely into the ink, said
· No, he has not lost his left arm, but it is placed on his
breast.' This correction made his description more
striking than it had been without it; since Lord Nelson
generally had his empty sleeve attached to the breast of
his coat ; but it was the right arm that he had lost. With
out liaying that I suspected the boy had made a mistake, I
asked the magician whether the objects appeared in the
ink as if actually before the eyes, or as if in a glass, which
makes the right appear left. He answered that they
appeared as in a mirror. This rendered the boy's descrip-
tion faultless. Though completely puzzled, l was some-
what disappointed with his t'erformances, for they fell
short of what be had accomplished in many instances in
presence of ~rtain of my frien<_ls and countrym~n: On
one of these occasions an Englishman present ndiculed
the performance, and said that nothing would satisfy him
but a correct description of the appearance of his own
father, of whom he was sur~ no one of the company had
any knowledge. The boy, accordingly, having called by
name for the person alluded to, described a man in a Frank
dress, with his hand placed on his head, wearing spectacles,
and with one foot on the ground and the other raised
behind him, as if he were stepping down from a seat. The
description w·as exactly true in every respect; the peculiar
position of the hand was occasioned by an almost constant
headache, and that ol the foot or leg by a stiff koee, caused
by a fall from a horse in hunting. On another occasion
Shakespeare was described with the most minute exactness,
both as to person and dress, and I might add several other
cases in which the same magician has excited astonishm~r.t
in the sober minds of several Englishmen of my acquatn-
tance.'' So far Mt. Lane, whose account may be compared
with that given by !vir. Kinglake, the author of E_othen.
It may be worth adcllng, that in another case of hydro-
mancy known to Elihu "Rich, the boy could see better
without the medium than with it-though be could also
see reflected images in a vessel of water. Tbis fact may be
admjtted to prove that such images are reflected to the el!e
of the seer from his own mind and brain ; how the bram
beCOmes thus enclmntcd, or the eye dispo~ed for vision, is
another question; certainly it is no proof that the recollected
image in the miod of the inquirer is transferred to the seer,
as proofs can be shO\Vll to the contrary.

The phenomenon of llypertBsthesi_a, observed but. wrongly
interpreted by the early magnetists and mesmensts, was
largely responsible for the so-called clairvoyance, th?ught-
reading, community of sensation, and other kmdred
phenomena. The realisation of suggestion and hyp_era:s-
tllesia was the great achievement of Be1 trand and Bra.~d,
which brought hypnotism into the domain nf scientific fact.
The significance of llypertZslflesia in connection with every
form of psychic phenomena can hardly be over estimated.
Nor is it met with only in the t.rancc state. It enters into
t he normal existence to an extent that is but imperfectly
understood. Dreams, for instance, frequently reproduce
impressions which have been recorded in some obscure
stratum of consciousness, while much that we caU intuition
is made up of inferences subconsciously drawn from indica-
tions too subtle to reach the normal consciousness. Hyper-
tZslhesia has been defined above as " an actual or appaYe?zl
exaltation of the perceptive faculties.'' The reason for
this is that modern scientists declare that it is not known
whether the senses are actually sharpened or not. Most
Hypnosis 216
probably the hyperaslhetic perception is merely a normal
perception which by reason of the state of cerebal dissocia-
tion operates in a free field. Very slight sense-impressions
may be recorded in the brain during normal consciousness,
but such is the inhibiting effect of the excitementoccasioned
by other similar impressions, that they do not reach full
consciousness.
Hypnosis : (See Hypnotism).
Hypnotism : A peculiar state of cerebral dissociation dis-
tinguished by certain marked symptoms, the most
prominent and invariable uf which is a highly-increa-sed
suggestibility in the subject. The hypnotic state may be
induced in a very large percentage of normal individuals,
or may occur spontaneously. It is recognised as having an
affinity with normal sleep, and likewise with a variety of
abnormal conditions, among which may be mentioned
somnambulism, ecstasy, and the trances of Hindu fakirs
and savage medicine-men. In fact, in one vr other of
their forms, hypnosis and its kindred have been known in
practically all countries and all times.
Hypnotism is no longer classed with the occult sciences.
It bas gained, though only within comparatively recent
years, a definite scientific status. and no mean place in
legitimate medicine. Nevertheless its llistoryis inextricably
intenvoven with occultism, and even to-day much hypnotic
phenomena is classed as " spiritualistic " ; so that the
consideration of hypnotism in this place is very necessary
to a proper understanding of much of the occult science of
our own and former times.
The Early Mag11etists.-So far back as the x6th century
hypnotic phenomena were observed and studied by men of
science, who attributed them to mag11etism, an effluence
radiating from every object in the universe. in a greater or
less degree, ar.d tluough which all objects might exercise
a mutual influence one on another. From this doctrine
was constructed the " sympathetic " system of medicine,
by means of which the magnetic effluence of the planets, of
the actual magnet. or of the physician, was brought to
bear upon the patient. Paracelsus is generally supposed
to be the originator of the sympathetic system, as he was
its most powerful exponent. Of the magnet he says :-
"The magnet has long lain before all eyes, and no
one has ever thought whether it was of any further use, or
whether it possessed any other property, than that of
attracting iron. The sordid doctors throw it in my face
that I will not follow the ancients; but in what should I
follow them ? All that they have said of the magnet
amounts to nothing. Lay that which I have said of it in the
balance, and judge. Had I blindly followed others, and
bad I not myself made experiments, I should in like manner
know nothing more than what every peasant sees-that it
attracts iron. But a wise man must enquire for himself,
and it is thus that I have discovered that tll.e magnet,
besides this obvious and to every man visible p6wer, that
of attracting iron, possesses another and concealed power."
-That of healing the sick.
And there is no doubt that cures were actually effected
by Paracelsus with the aid of the magnet, espec:ally in
cases of epilepsy and nervous affections. Yet the word
"magnet" is most frequently used by Paracelsus and his
followers in a figurative sense, to denote the magnes
microcosmi, man himself, who was supposed to be a repro-
duction in miniature of the earth, having, like it, his poles
and magnetic properties From the stars and planets, he
taught, carne a very subtle effluence which affected man's
mind or intellect, while earthly substances radiated a
grosser emanation which affected his body. The human
mummy especially was a " magnet " well suited for
remedial purposes, since it draws to itself the diseases and
poisonous properties of other substances. The most
Hypnotism
effective mummy was that of a criminal who had been
hanged, and it was applied in the following manner. " If
a person suffer from disease, " says Paracelsus, ·' either
local or general, experiment with the following remedy.
Take a magnet impregnated with mummy, and combined
with rich earth. In this earth sow some seeds that have a
likeness to, or homogeneity with, the disease ; then let this
earth, well sifted and mixed with mummy, be laid in an
earthen vessel, and let the seeds committed to it be watered
daily with a lotion in which the diseased limb or body has
been washed. Thus will the disease be transplanted from
the human body to the seeds which are in the earth.
Having done this, transplant the seeds from the earthen
vessel to the ground, and wait till they begin to flourish
into herbs. As they increase, the disease will diminish,
and when they have reached their mature growth, will
altogether disappear." The quaint but not altogether'
illogical idea of " weapon-salve "-anointing the weapon
instead of the wound-was also used by Paracelsus,
his theory being that part of the vital spirits clung to the
weapon and exercised an ill effect on the vital spirits in the
\vound, which would not heal until the ointment had first
been applied to the weapon ; this also was an outcome of
the magnetic theory.
Towards the end of the 16th century Paracelsus was
worthily succeeded by J. B. ,·an Helmont, a scientist of
distinction and an energetic protagonist of magnetism.
" Material nature," be writes, " dra'wS her forms through
constant magnetism from above, and implores for them
the favour of heaven; and as heaven, in like manner,
draws something invisible from below, there is established
a free and mutual intercourse, and the whole is contained
in an individual." Van Helmont believed also in the
power of the will to direct the subtle fluid. There was. he
held, in all created things. a magic or celestial power
tluough which they were allied to heaven. This power or
strength is greatest in the soul of man, resides in a less
degree in his body, and to some extent is present in the
lower animals, plants, and inorganic matter. It is oy
reason of his superior endovnnent in this respect that man
is enabled to rule the other creatures, and to make use of
inanimate objects for his own purposes. The power is
strongest when one is asleep, for then the body is quiescent,
and the soul most active and dominant; and for this
reason dreams and prophetic visions are more common in
sleep. "The spirit," he says," is everywhere diffused, and·
the spirit is the medium of magnetism ; not the spirits of
heaven and of hell, but the spirit of man, which is con-
cealed in him as the fire is concealed in the tlint. The
human will makes itself master of a portion of its spirit
of life, which becomes a connecting property between the
corporeal and the incorporeal, and diffuses itself like the
light." To this ethereal spirit he ascribes the visions
seen by " the inner man " in ecstasy, and also those of
the " outer man " and the lower animals. In proof of the
mutual influence of living creatures he asserts that men
may kill animals merely by staring hard at them for a.
quarter of a:n hour. That Van Helmont was not ignora~t
of the power of imagination is evident from many of his.
writings. A common needle, he declares, may by m~ns­
o! certain manipulations, and the will-power and. 1magJna·
tions of the operator, be made to possess magneb.c proper-
ties. Herbs may become very powerful throug~ the
imagination of him who gathers them. And agam :-
"I have hitherto avoided revealing the great secret, that.
the strength lies concealed in man, merely through the sug•
gestion and power of the imagination to work outwa:rdty,
and toimpress this strength on others, which then contlnues
of itself, and operates on the remotest objects. Througl:t
this secret alone will all receive its true illuxnination-
Hypnotism 217
all that has hitlterto been brought together labor-
iously of the ideal being out of the spirit-aU that has been
said of the magnetism of all things-of the strength of the
human soul- of the magic of man, and of his dominion
over the physical world." Van IIelmont also gave special
importance to the stomach as the chief seat of the soul, and
recounts an experience of his own in which, on touching
some aconite with his tongue, he finds all his senses trans-
ferred to his stomach. In after years this was to be a
favourite accomplishment of somnambules and cataleptic
subjects. (See Stomach, Seeing wltb.)
A distinguished English magnetist was Robert Fludd,
who wrote in the first part of the 17th century. Flud:l
\vas an exponent of the microcosmic theory, and a believer
in the magnetic effluence from man. Kot only were these
emanations able to cure bodily. diseases, but they also
affected the moral sentiments; for if radiations from two
individuals were, on meeting, flung back or distorte:l,
negative magnetism, or antipathy resulted, whereas if the
radiations from each person passed freely into those from
the other, the result was positive magnetism, or sympathy.
Examples of positive and negative magnetism were also
to be lound among the lower animals and among plants.
Another magnetist of distinction was the Scottish physician,
Maxwell, who L-; said to have anticipated much ol Mesmer's
doctrine. He declares that those who are familiar with
the operation of the universal spirit can, through its agency
cure all diseases, at no matter what distance. He also
suggests that the practice of magnetism, though very
valuable in the hand of a well-disposed physician, is not
without its dangers. and is liable to many abuses.
While the theoretical branch of magnetism was thus
receiving attention at the hands of the alchemical philoso-
phers, the practical side was by no means neglected. There
were in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a number
of" divine healers," whose magic cures were without doubt
the result of hypnotic suggestion. Of these perhaps the
best known and most successful were Valentine GreatraJ:es,
an Irishman, and a Swabian priest named Gassner. Great-
rakes was born in 1628, and on reaching manhood served
for some time in the Irish army, thereafter settling down on
his estate in Waterford. In 1662 he had a dream in which
it was revealed to him that he possessed the gift of curing
Iring's evil. The dream was repeated several times ere he
paid heed to it. but at length he made the experiment,
his own wife being the first to be healed by him. Many
who came to him from the surrounding country were
cured when he laid his hands upon them. Later the
impression came upon him strong!)' that he could cure
other diseases besides king's evil. News of hL~ wonderful
powers spread far and wide, and patients came in hundreds
to seek his aid. Despite the fact that "the Bishop of the
Diocese forbade the exercise of these apparently magical
powers, Greatrakes continued to heal the afflicted people
who sought him. In 1666 he proceeded to London, and
though not invariably successful, he seems to have per-
formed there a surprising number of cures, which wert'
testified to by Robert Boyle, Sir William Smith, Andrew
Marvell, and many other eminent people. He himself
describes them in a work entitled "Val. Greatrakes. Esq.,
of Waterford. in the kingdom of Ireland, famous for curing
several diseases and distempers by the stroak of his hand
only : London, t66o." His method of healing war. to
stroke the affected part with his hand, thus driving the
disease into the limbs and so finally out of the body.
Sometimes the treatment acted as though by magic. but
if immediate relief was not obtained the rubbing was
continued. and but few cases were dis_
missed as mcurable.
Even epidemic diseases he healed by a touch. It is said
that during the treatment the patient's fingers and toes
Hypnotism
remained insensible to external stimuli, and frequently he-
himself showed every symptom of such a magnetic crisis
as was afterwards to become a special feature of mesmeric
treatment. Personally Greatrakes was a simple and pious
gentleman, persuaded that his marvellous powers were a
divinely-bestowed gift, and most anxious to make the best
use of them. The other healer mentioned, Gassner, belongs
to a somewhat later period-about the middle of the
eighteenth century. Gassner was a priest of Bludenz in
Vorarlberg. where his many cures gained for him a wide
celebrity. All diseases. according to him, were caused by
e\il spirits possessing the patient, and his mode of healing
thus consisted of exorcising the demons. He too was a
man of kindly disposition and piety, and made a large use
of the Scriptures in his healing operations. The ceremonr
of exorcism was a rather impressive one. Herr Gassner
sat at a table, the patient and spectators in front of him,
A blue red-flowered cloak hung from his shoulders ; the
rest of his clothing, we arc told, was " clean, simple, and
modest." On his left was a window, on his right, the
crucifix. His fine personality. deep learning, and noble
character inspired the faith of the patient and his friends
and doubtless played no small part in his curative feats.
Sometimes be made use of magnetic manipulations, stroking
or rubbing the affected part, and driving the disease, after
the manner of Greatrakes, into the limbs of the patient.
The formula of exorcism he generally pronounced in Latin,
with whioh language the demons showed a perfect familiar-
ity. Not only could be control sickness by these means, but
the passions also were amenable to his treatment. " Now
anger is apparent, now patience, now joy, now sorrow,
now hate, now love, now confusion, now reason,-each
carried to the highest pitch. Now this one is blind, no"'
he sees, and again is deprived of sight, etc." These curious
results suggest the phreno-magnetism of later years. where
equally sudden changes of mood were produced by touching
with the finger-tips those parts o! the subject's head which
pb.renology associated with the various emotions to be
called forth.
Hitherto it will be seen that the rational and supernatural
explanations of magnetism had run parJ.llel with one
another, the former most in favour with the philosophers.
the latter with the populace. It was reserved for Emanuel
Swedenborg (q.v.) (r688- r772), the Swedish philosopher
and spiritualist, to unite the doctrine of magnetism with
that of spiritualism-1.8., the belief in the action in the
external world of the discarnate spirits of deceased human
beings. That Swedenborg accepted some of the theories of
the older magnetists is evident from his mystical writings,
from which the following passage has been extracted.
" In order to comprehend the origin and progress of this
influence (i.e., God's influence over man), we must first
know that that which proceeds from the Lord is the divine
sphere which surrounds us, and fills the spiritual and
natural world. AU that proceeds from an object, and
surrounds and clothes it, is called its sphere.
" As all that is spiritual knows neither time nor space, it
therefore follows that the general sphere or the divine one
has extended itself from the first moment of creation to the
last. This divine emanation, which passed over from the
spiritual to the natural, penetrates actively and rapidly
through the whole created worlc., to the last grade of it.
where it is yet to be found, and produces and maintains all
that is animal, vegetable, and mineral. Man is continually
surrounded by a sphere of his favourite propensities; these
unite themselves to the natural sphere of his body. so that
together they form one. The natural sphere surrounds
every body of nature, and all the objects of the three-
kingdoms. Thus it allies itself to the spiritual world. This is-
the foundation of srmpatby and antipathy, of union and.
.Hypnotism 218 Hypnotism
separation, according to which there are amongst spirits
presence and absence.
" T~e angel said to me that the sphere surrounded man
more lightly on the back than on the breast, where it was
thicker and stronger. This sphere of influence peculiar to
man operates also in general and in particular around him
~y means of the will, the understanding, and the prac-
tlce.
" The sphere proceeding from God, which surrounds man
.and constitutes his strength, while it thereby operates on
his neighbour and on the whole creation, is a sphere of
peace, and !nnocence ; for the Lord is peace and innocence.
Then only IS man consequently able to make his influence
effectual on his fellow man, when peace and innocence rule
in his heart, and he himself is in union with heaven. This
spiritual union is connected with the natural by a benevo-
lent man through the touch and the laying on of hands, by
which the influence of the inner man is quickened, prepared,
and imparted. The body communicates with others
-which are about it through the body, and the spiritual
influence diffuses itself chiefly through the hands, because
these arc the most. outward or ultimum of man ; and
through him, as in the whole of nature, the first is con-
tained in the last, as the cause in the effect. The whole
soul and the whole body are contained in the hands as a
medium of influence."
i\tfesmuism or Animal Magnetism.-In the latter h;llf
of the eighteenth century a new era was inaugurated in
connection with the doctrine of a magnetic fluid. The
fresh impetus which the science o1 magnetism received at
that period was due in a very large measure to the works of
Franz Antoine Mesmer (q.v.), a physician from whose
name the word " mesmerism " was taken, He was born
at Wiel, near Lake Constance, in I 733, and studied medicine
.at the University of Vienna, taking his doctor's degree in
1766. In the same year he published his first work, pe
Planetarum b1jf11xu (" De !'influence des Planettes sur le
corps humain "). Though he claimed to have thereby
discovered the existence of a universal fluid, to which he
gave the name of magnllisme anima(, there is no doubt that
his doctrine was in many respects identical with that of the
older magnetists mentioned above. The idea of the univer-
sal fluid was suggested to him in the first place by his
observation of the stars, which led him to believe the
celestial bodies exercised a mutual influence on each other
and on the earth. This he identi1ied with magnetism, and
it was but a step-and a step which had already been taken
by the early magnetists-to extend this influence to the
human body and all other objects, and to apply it to the
science of medicine. In 1776 Mesmer met with Gassner,
the Swabian priest whose miraculous cures have already
been considered ; and, setting aside the supernatural
explanation offered by the healer himself, Mesmer declared
that the cures and severe crises which followed on his
manipulations were attributable to nothing but magnetism.
Nevertheless this encounter gave a new trend to his ideas.
Hitherto he himself had employed the magnet in order to
cure the sick, but seeing that Gassner dispensed with that
aid, he was led to consider whether the power might not
r eside in a still greater degree in the human body. Mesmer's
first cure was performed on an epileptic patient, by means of
-magnets, but the honour of it was d1sputed by a Jesuit
named Hell, who had supplied the magnetic plates, and
who claimed to have discovered the principles on which the
physician worked. Thereafter for a (ew years Mesmer
practised in various European cities, and strove to obtain
"Tecognition for his theories, but without success. In 1778
however, he went to Paris, and there attained an immediate
artd triumohant success in the fashionable world, though
-the learned bodies still refused to have angth.ing to say to
him. Aristocratic patients flocked in hundreds to Mes-
mer's consulting-rooms, which were hung with mirrors, it
being one of the physicians' theories that mirrors augmented
the magnetic fluid. He himself wore, it is said, a shirt of
leather, lined with silk, to prevent the escape of the tluid,
while magnets were hung about his person to increase his
natural supply of magnetism. The pahents were seated
round a baguet or magnetic tub, of w6ich the foUo.,.ing
description is given by Seifert, one of :Mesmer's biographers.
" This receptacle was a large pan, tub, or pool of water,
filled "ith various magnetic substances, such as water,
sand, stone, glass bottles (filled with magnetic water),
etc. It was a focus within which the magnetism was con-
centrated, and out of which proceeded a number of COD•
ductors. These being bent pointed iron wands, one end
was retained in the baguet, whilst the other was connected
:with the patient and applied to the seat of the disease.
This arrangement might be made use of by any nun1ber of
persons seated round the baguel, and thus !l fountain, or
any receptacle in a garden, as in a room, would answer
for the purpose desired." For the establishment of a
school of Animal Magnetism Mesmer was offered 20,ooo
livres by the French government, with an annual sum of
to.ooo livres for its upkeep; but this he refused. Later,
however, the sum of 340,000 livres was subscribed by
prospective pupils, and hancled over to him. One of
Mesmer's earliest and most distiguished disciples was
M. D'Eslon, a prominent physician, who laid the doctrines
of animal magnatism before the Faculty of Medicine in
178o. Consideration of Mesmer's theories was, however,
indignantly refused, and D'Eslon warned to rid himself of
such dangerous doctrine. Another disciple of Mesmer
who attained to distinction in magnetic practise was the
Marquis de Puysegur, who was the ftrst to observe and
describe the state of induced somnambulism now as well
known as the hypnotic trance. It has been suggested,
and seems not improbable, that Mesmer himself lrnew some-
thing of the induced trance, but believi!lg it to be a state
full of danger, steadfastly set his face against it. However
that may be, Pu~gur's ideas on the subject began to
supersede those of Mesmer, and he gathered about him a
distinguished body of adherents, among whom was num-
bered the celebrated Lavatcr. Indeed, his recognition
of the fact that the symptoms attending the " magnetic
sleep " were resultant from it, was a step of no small
importance in the history of mesmerism. In 1i84 a
commission was appointed by the French government to
enquire into the magnetic phenomena. For some reason
or another its members chose to investigate the e>.."J>Criments
of D'Eslon, rather than those of Mesmer himself. The
commissioners, including among their number Benjamin
,Franklin, Lavoisier, and Bailly, observed the peculiar
crises attending the treatment, and the ,-apport between
patient and physician, but decided that imagmation could
produce all the effects, and that there was no evidence
whatever for a magnetic fluid. The report, edited by M.
Bailly, gives the following description of the crisis. .
•• The sick persons, arranged m great numbers, and m
several rows around the baqt4et (batb), received the mag-
netism by means of the iron rods, which conveyed it to
them from the baque/ by the cords wound round their
bodies, by the thumb which connected them with t heir
neighbours, and by the sounds of a pian~forte, or an
agreeable vo.ice, diffusing ma~netism in the .a1r.
" The patients were also' d1rectly magnetised by means
of the finger and wand of the magnetiser, moved slowly
before their faces, above or behind their heads, or on the
diseased parts.
"The magnetiser acts also by fixing his eyes on the
subjects; by the application of his hands on the region of
Hypnotism 219 Hypnotism
the solar plexus ; an appUcation which sometimes. con-
tinues for hours.
" Meanwhile the patients present a very varied picture.
" Some are calm, tranquil, and experience no effect.
Others cough and spit, feel pains, heat, or perspiration.
Others, again, are convulsed.
" As soon as one begins to be convulsed, it is remarkable
that others are immediately affected.
" The commissioners have observed some of these con-
vulsions last more than three hours. They are often accom-
panied with expectorations of a violent character, often
streaked with blood. The convulsions are marked with
involuntary motions of the throat, limbs, and sometimes
the whole body ; by dimness of the eyes, shrieks, sobs,
laughter, and the wildest hysteria. These states are often
followed by languor and depression. The smallest noise
appears to aggravate the symptoms, and often to occasion
shudderings and terrible cries. It was noticeable that a
sudden change in the air or time of the music had a great
influence on the patients, and soothed or accelerated the
convulsions, stimulating them to ecstasy, or moving them
to floods of tears.
" Nothing is more astonishing than the spectacle of
these convulsions.
" One who has not seen them can form no idea of them.
The spectator is as much astonished at t he profound
repose of one portion o! the patients as at the agitation of
t he rest.
"Some of the patients may be seen rushing towards
each other with open arnis, and manifesting every symptom
of attachment and affection.
" All are under the power of the magnetizer ; it matters
not what state of drowsiness they may be in, the sound of
his voice, a look, a motion of his hands, spasmodically
afiects them."
Though Mesmer, Puysegur, and their followers con-
tinued to practise magnetic treatment, the report of the
royal commission had the e1Ject of quenching public
interest in the subject, though from time to time a spas-
modic interest in it was shown by scientists. M. de
Jussieu, at about the time the commission presented its
report, suggested that it would have done well to enquire
into the reality of the alleged cures, and to endeavour to
:find a satisfactory explanation for the phenomena they
had witnessed ; while to remedy the deficiency he himself
form11lated a theory of" animal heat," an organic emana·
tion which. might be directed by the human will. Like
Mesmer and the others, he believed in action at a distance.
Mesmeric practitioners formed themselves into" Societies
of Harmony," until the political situation in France
rendered their existence impossible. Early in the nine·
teenth century Petetin and Delenze published works on
magnetism. But a new era was inaugurated with the
publication in 1823 of Alexandre Bertrand's Tf'aiti du
Somnambulisme, followed three years later by a treatise
Du Magnilisme Animal en Fratacc. Bertrand was a young
p~ysician of Pari.s, and to him belongs the honour of having
d•scovered the Important part played by suggestion in
t he phenomena of the induced trance. He had observed
the connection between the magnetic sleep, epidemic
ecstasy, and spontaneous sleep-walking, and declared that
all the cures and strange symptoms which had formerly
been attributed to " animal magnetism," " animal elec-
tricity," and the like, resulted from the suggestions of the
operator acting on the imagination of a patient whose
sug~estil?ility was greatly_ inc.rea..<;ed. It is probable that
~d he lived longer-he died m 1831, at the age of thirty-
s•x-Bertrand would have gained a definite scientific
standing for the facts of the induced trance; but as it was
the practitioners of animal m~gnetism still held to the
theory of a ftuid or force radiating from magnetizer to
subject, while thoso who were unable to accept such a
doctrine, ignored the matter altogether, or treated it as
vulgar fraud and charlatanry. Nevertheless Bertrand's
wori.."S and experiments revived the flagging interest of the
public to such an extent that in 1831 a second French
commission was appointed by the Royal Academy of
~fedicinc. The report of this commission was not forth-
coming till more than five years had elapsed, but when it
was finally pubUshed it contained a definite testimony to the
genuineness of the magnetic phenomena, and especially
oi the somnambulic state ; and declared that the com-
mission was satisfied of the therapeutic value of " animal
magnetism." The report was certainly not of great
scientific worth. The name of Bertrand is not evel;l
mentioned therein, nor h.is theory considered ; on the other
hand, a good deal of space is given to the more supernatural
phenomena, clairvoyance, action at a distance, and the
prediction by somnambulic patients of crises in their
maladies. This is the more excusable, however, since these
ideas were almost universally associated with somnambu-
lism. Community of sensation (q.v.) was held to be a
feature of t he trance state, as was also the transference of
the sen.ses to the stomach-(Sce Stomach, seeing with),
while thought-transference was suggested by some of these
earlier investigator.;, notably by Deleuze, who suggested
that thoughls were conveyed from the brain of the operator
to that of the subject through the medium of the subtle
magnetic fluid. Meanwhile the spiritualist;ic theory was
becoming more and more frequently advanced to explain
the " magnetic " phenomena, inclu'ding both the legitimate
trance phenomena and the multitude of supernormal
phenomena which was supposed to follow the somnambulic
state. This will doubtless account in part for the extra-
ordinary animosity which the medical profession shewed
towards animal magnetism as a therapeutic agency. Its
ana:sthetic properties they ridiculed as fraud or imagination,
not·withstanding that serious operations, even of the
amputation o£ limbs, could be performed while the patient
was in the magnetic sleep. Thus Dr. John Elliotson was
forced to resign his professorship at the University Co!Jege
Hospital; Dr. James Esdaile, a surgeon who practised at
a goverhmert hospital at Calcutta, had to contend with
much ignorance and stupid conservatism in his professional
brethren ; and similar contemptuous treatment was dealt
out to other medical men, aga1nst whom nothing could be
urged but their defence of mesmerism. In 1841 James
Braid, a Manchester surgeon, arrived independE'ntly at the
conclusions which Bertrand had reached some eighteen
years earlier. Once more the theory of abnormal sugges-
t ibility was offered to explain the various phenomena. of the
so-called " magnetic " sleep ; and once more it was utterly
ignored, alike by the world of science and by the public.
Braid's explanation was essentially that which is offered
now. He placed the new science-hypnotism, he called it,
on a level with other natural ~ciences, above the mass of
nedi:cval magic and superstition in which he had found it.
r et even Braid does not seem to llave entirely separated
the chaff from the grain, for we find him countenancing the
practice of phreno-magnetism (q.v.). a combination of
mesmerism and phrenology wherein the entranced patient.
who~c head is touched by the operator's fingers, exhibits
every sign of the emotion or quality associated with the
phrenological organ touched. Braid asserts that a subject,
entirely ignorant of the position of the phrenological
organs, passed rapidly and accurately from one emotion to
another, according to the portion of the s~lp in contact
with the hypnotist's fingers. His physiological explana-
tion is a somewhat inadequate one, and we can onlysuppose
that he was not fully appreciative of his own theory of
Hypnotism 220
suggestion. In 1843 t\'1'0 periodicals dealing with magnet-
ism appeared-the Zoist, edited by Dr. Elliotson and a
colleague. and the Phreno-Magnet, edited by Spencer T.
Hall. The first. adopting a scientific tone, treated the
subject mainly from a therapeutic point of view, while the
latter was of a more popular character. :Many of the
adherents of both papers. and notably Elliot.son himself,
afterwards became spiritualists. In 1845 an additional
impetus was given to animal magnetism by the publica-
tion in that year of Baron von Reichenbach's researches.
Reichenbach claimed to have discovered a new force, which
he called odyle, od, or odylic force, and which could be seen
in the form of ftames by " sensitives." In the human
being these emanations might be seen to radiate from the
finger-tips, while they were also visible in animals and
inanimate things. Different colours issued from the
different poles of the magnet. Reichenbach experimented
by putting his sensitives in a dark room with various
objects-crystals, precious stones, magnets, minerals,
plants, animals-when they could unerringly distinguish
each object by the colour and size of the ftame visible to
their clairvoyant eye. Tbese emanations were so invariable
and so permanent that an artist might paint them. and
this indeed, was frequently done. Feelings of tempera-
tur~. of beat or cold. were also experienced in connection
with the odylic force. Baron von Reichenbach's experi-
ments were spread over a number of years. and were made
with every appearance of scientific care and precision, so
that their effect on the mesmerists of the time was very
considerable. But notwithstanding the mass of dubious
phenomena which was associated with hypnotism at that
time, there is no doubt but that the induced trance, with
its therapeutic and an;esthetic value, would soon have
come into its own had not two circumstances occurred to
thrust it into the background. The first was the applica-
tion of chloroform and ether to the purposes for which
hypnotum had hitherto been used, a substitution which
pleased the medical faculty greatly. and relieved its mem-
bers from the necessity of studying hypnotism. The second
circumstance was the introduction of the movement known
as modern spiritualism, which so emphasised the occult
side of the trance phenomena as to obscure for nearly half
a century the true significance of induced somnambulism.
Modem Views of Hypnotism.- But if the great body of
medical arid public opinion ignored the facts of hypnotism
during the period following Braid's discovery, the subject
did not fail to receive some attention from the more scienti-
fic portion of Europe. and from time to time investigators
took upon themselves the task of enquiring into the phenom-
ena. This was especially the case in France, where the
science of mesmerism or hypnotism was most firmly en-
trenched, and where it met with least opposition. In 1858
Dr. Azam, of Dordeaux, investigated hypnotism from
Braid's point of view, aided by a number of members of the
Faculty of Paris. An account of his researches was pub-
lished in x86o, but cast no new light on the matter. Later
the same set of facts were examined by Mesnet, Duval,
and others. In 1875 Professor Richet also studied the
science of artificial somnambulism. It is, however, from
Bernheim and the Nancy school that the generally accepted
modem view of hypnotism is taken. Bernheim was himself
a disciple of I.iebeault, who, working on independent lines,
had reached the conclusions of Bertrand and Braid and
once more formulated.the doctrine of suggestion. Bern-
heim's work De Ia Suggution, published in x884, emboCied
the theories of .Liebe.ault and the result of Bernheim's
own researches therein. According to this view, then,
hypnotism is a purely psychological process, and is induced
by mental in1l\•ences. The " passes " of Mesmer and the
magnetic philosophers, the elaborate preparations of the
Hypnotism
baquet, the. strokings of Valentine Greatrakes, and all the
multitudinous ceremonies with which the animal magnetists
were wont to produce the artificial sleep, were only of
service in inducmg a state of expectation in the patient, or
in providing a soothing and monotonous, or violent,
sensory stimulus. And so also with the modem methods
ofinducing hypnosis; the fixation of the ~yes, the contactof
the operators hand, the sound of his voice. are only effective
through the medium of the subject"s mentality. Other
investigators who played a large part in popularising
hypnotism were Professor ]. M. Charcot, of the Salpetrihe,
Paris, a distinguished pathologist, and R. Heidenbain,
professor of physiology at Breslau. The former taught
that the hypnotic condition was essentially a morbid one,
and allied to hysteria ; a theory which, becoming widely
circulated, exercised a somewhat detrimental effect on the
practice of hypnotism for therapeutic purposes. till it was
at length proved erroneous. Even now a prejudice lingers,
particularly in this country. against the use of the induced
hypnotic trance in medicine. Heidenbain, again, laid
stress on the physical operations to induce somnambulism.
believing that thereby a peculiar state of the net:vous-
system was brought about, wherein the contTol of the
higher nerve centres was temporarily removed, so that the
suggestion of the operator was free to express itself auto-
matically through the physical organism of the patient.
Tbe physiological theory also is somewhat misleading ;
nevertheless its exponents have done good work in bringing
the undoubted facts of hypnosis into prominence. Besides
these theories there is another which is to be met with
chiefly in its native France--the old doctrine of a magnetic
fluid. But it is rapidly dying out. Among the symptoms
which may safely. and without reference to the super-
natural. be regarded as attendant on hypnotism are the
rapport between patient and operator, implicit obedience
on the part of the former to the smallest suggestion,
whether given verbally or by look, gesture, or any uncon-
scious action, an;esthesia, positive and negative hallucina-
tions, the fulfilment of post-hypnotic promises, control of
organic processes and of muscles not ordinarily under
voluntary control. Other phenomena which have been
allied from time to time with magnetism, mesmerism, or
hypnotism, and for which there is not the same scientific
basis, are clairvoyance, telekinesia, transference of the
senses from the ordinary sense-organs to some other parts
of the body, usually the finger tips or the pit of the stomach,
community of sensation, and the ability to commune with
the dead. The majority of these, like the remarkable
phenomena of phreno-magnetism, can be directly traced
to the effect of suggestion on the imagination of the patient.
Ignorant as were the protagonists of mesmerism with regard
to the great suggestibility of the magnetised subject, it is
hardly surprising that they saw new and supernorinal
faculties and agencies at work during the trance state. To
the same ignorance of the possibilities of suggestion and
hyper<esthesia may be referred the common belief that the
hypnotizer can influence his subject by the power of his
will alone, and secure obedience to commands which are
only mentally expressed. At the same time it must be
borne in mind that if the growing belief in teleyathy be
accepted, there is a possibility that the operation o thought
transference may be more freely carried out during hypnosis,
and it is notable, in this respect, that the most fruitful of
the telepathic experiments conducted by psychical re-
searchers and others have been made w~th hypnotized
percipients. (See Telepathy.)
Among numerous explanations of the physiological
conditions accompanyin6 the hypnotic state there is one,
the theoty of cerebral dL'ISOCiation, which is now generally
accepted of science, and which may be briefty outlined as
Hypnotism 221
follows. The brain is composed of innumerable groups of
nerve cells, all more or less closely connected with each
other by means of nervous links or paths of variable
resistance. Excitement of any of these groups, whether
by means of impressions received through the sense organs
or by the communicated activity of other groups, will, if
sufficiently intense, occa.o;ion the rise into consciousness of
an idea. In the normal waking state the resistance of the
nervous association-paths is fairly low, so that the activity
is easily communicated from one neural group to another.
Thus the main idea which reaches the upper stratum of
consciousness is attended by a stream of other. subcon-
scious ideas, which has the effe<:t of checking the primary
idea and preventing its complete dominance. Now the
abnormal dominance of one particular system of ideas--
that suggested by the operator-together with the com-
plete suppression of all rival systems, is the principal fact
to be explained in h}'Pnosis. To some extent the physiolo-
gical process conditioning hypnosis suggests an analogy
with normal sleep. \Vhcn one composes himself to sleep
thereis a lowering o.f cerebralexcitement and a proportionate
increase in the resistance of the neural links ; and this is
precisely what happens during hypnosis. the essential
passivity of the subject raising the resistance of the associa-
tion-paths. But in normal sleep, unless some exciting
cause be present, all the neural dispositions are ~t rt'st,
whereas in the latter case such a complete suspension of
cerebral activities is not permitted, since the operator, by
means of voice, gestures, and manipulations of the patient's
limbs, keeps alive that set of impressions relating to him·
self. One neural disposition is thus isolated, so that any
idea suggested by the operator is free to work itself out
in action, without being submitted to t he checks of the
sub-activity of other ideas. The alienation is less or more
complete according as the degree of hypnotism is light or
heavy, but a comparatively slight raising of resistance in
the neural links suffices to secure the dominance of ideas
suggested by the hypnotizer. Hyper3!Sthesia, than which
perhaps no phenomenon is more frequently mentioned in
connection with the hypnotic state, really belongs to the
doubtful class, since it has not yet been decided whether
or no an actual sharperung or refining of the senses takes
place. Alternatively it may be suggested that the accurate
perception of very faint sense-impressions, which seems to
furrush evidence for hyperzsthesia, merely recalls the fact
that the excitement conveyed through the sensory nerve
operates with extraordinary force, being freed from the
restriction of sub-excitement in adjacent neural groups
and systems. In accepting this view-point we concede
that in normal life very feeble sensory stimuli must act on
nerve. and brain just as they do in hypnosis, save that in
the former case they are so stifled amid a multitude of
similar impressions that they !ail to reach consciousness.
In any case the occasional abnormal sensitiveness of the
~ubject to very slight sensory stimuli is a fact of hypnotism
as well .authenticated as an;:csthesia itself, and the term
" hyper<esthcsia," if ll.Qt entirely justified, may for want
of a better be practically applied to the observed phenome-
non. The hypnotic state is not necessarily induced by a
second person. " Spontaneous" hypnotism and "auto-
hypnotisation " are well known to science. Certain
Indian fakirs and the shamans of uncivilised races can
produce in fhemselves a state closely approximating to
h}'Pnosis, by a prolon~cd fixation of the eyes, and by other
means. The mediunustic trance is also, as will be shown
hereafter, a case in point.
. Hypt~otism aJZd Spirilrtalism.-Spiritualism is a legacy
dU'ectly bequeathed by the magnetic philosophers of
media::val times, and through them, from the still older
astrologers and magi. It has been shown that at a very
Hypnotism
early date phenomena of a distinctly hypnotic character
were ascribed to the workings of spiritual agencies, whether
angelic or demoniac, by a certain percentage of the observers
Thus Greatrakes and Gassn~r believed themselves to have
been gifted with a divine power to heal diseases. Cases of
ecsta'iy, catalepsy and other trance states were gi\'en a
spiritual significance-i.e., demons, angels, elcmentals,
and so on, were supposed to speak through the lips of the
possessed. Witchcraft, in which the force of hypnotic
suggestion seems to have operated in a very large degree,
was thought to result from the witches' traffic with the
Prince of Darkness and h!s legions. Even in some cases the
souls of deceased men and women were identified with
these intelligences, though not generally until the time of
Swedenborg. Though the movement known as "modem
spiritualism " is usually dated from 1848. the year of the
" Rochester Rappings," the real growth of spiritualism was
much more gradual, and its roots were hidden in animal
magnetism. Emanuel Swendenborg, whose affinities with
the rnagnetists have already been referred to, e~ercised
a remarkable influence on the spiritualistic thought of
America aod Europe, and was in a sense the founder of that
faith. Automatic phenomena were even then a feature of
the magnetic trance, and clairvoyance, community of
sensation, and telepathy were believed in generally, and
regarded by many as evidences of spiritual communication.
Jn Germany Professor Jung-Stilling, Dr. C. Romer, Dr.
''Verner, and the poet and physician Justinus Kerner, were
among those who held opinions on these lines, the latter
pursuing his investigations with a somnambule who
became famous as the "Scerers of Prevorst "-Frau
Frederica Hauffe. Frau Hauffe could see and converse
·with the spirits of the deceased, and gave evidence of
prophetic vision and ci:W"Voyance. Physical phenomena
were witnessed in her presence, knockings, rattling of
chains, movement of objects without contact, and, in
short, such manifestations as were characteristic of the
poltergeist family. She was, moreover, the originator of a
" primeval ·• language. which she declared was that spoken
by the patriarchs. Thus Frau Hauffe, though only a
somnambule, or magnetic patient, possessed aU the qualities
of a successful SJ:?iritualistic medium. In England also
there were many c~rcumstances of a supernatural character
associated with mesmerism. Dr. Elllotson, who, as has
been indicated, was one of the best-known of Engtish
magnetists, became in time converted to a spiritualistic
theory, as offering an explanation of the clairvoyance and
similar phenomena which he thought to have obser\'cd in
his patients. France, the headquarters of the rationalist
school of magnetism, had, indeed, a good deal less to show
of spiritualistic opinion. Nonetheless even in that country
the latter doctrine made its appearance at intervals prior
to r848. J. P. F. Deleuze, a goOd scientist and an earnest
protagonist of magnetism, who published his Histoire
Critique du Magnetisme Animal in 1813, was said to have
embraced the doctrines o! spiritualism before he died.
Dr. G. P. Billot was another believer in spirit communica-
tion, and one who succeeded in obtaining physical pheno-
ena in the presence of his somnambules. It is, however,
in the person of Alphonse Cahagnct, a man of humble
origin who began to study induced somnambulisn1 about
the year r845, and who thereafter experimented with
somnambules, that we encounter the first French spiritual-
ist of distinction. So ·good was the evidence for spirit
communication furnished by Cahagnet and his subjects
that it remains among the best which the annals of the
movement can produce. Tn America, Laroy Sunderland,
Andrew Jackson Davis, and others who became pillars of
spiritualism in that country were first attr.J.cted to it
through the study of magnetism. Everywhere we find
Hypnotism 222 Hypocepbalus
hypnotism and spiritualism identified with each other
until in 1848 a definite split occurs, and the two go their
separate ways. Even yet, however, the separation is not
quite complete. In the first place, the mediumistic tranc.:
is obviously a variant of spontaneous or self-induced
hypnotis:n, while in the sc::ond, many of the most striking
phenomena of the seance-room have been matched time
and again in the records of animal magnetism. For
instance, the diagnosis of disease and prescription of
remedies dictated by the control to the " healing medium "
have their prototype in the cures of Valentine Greatrakes,
or of .Mesmer and his disciples. Automatic phenomena-
speaking in " tongues " and so forth-early fo~ed a
characteristic feature of the induced trance and kindred
states. While even the physical phenomena. moveme?t
without contact, apports, rappings, were wi.tnessed In
connection with magnetism long before the movement
known as modern spiritualism was so much as thought of.
In many instances, though not in all, we can trace the
operation of hypnotic suggestion in the automatic phenom-
ena, just a.o; we can perceive the result of fraud in much of
the physical manifestations. The question whether, after
the factors of hypnotism and fraud have been removed, a
section of the phenomena remains inexplicable say by
the hypothesLc; of communication with the spirit-world
is one which has been in the past, and is to-day, answered
in the affirmative by many men of the highest distinction
in their various walks of hfe, and one which we would do
well to treat with due circumspection. This, however, is
reserved for consideration elsewhere, the scope of the
present arlicle being to show how largely spiritualism bas
borrowed from the fact of hypnotism. (See Suggestion.)
In ~r. Larclig's biography of the celebrated painter,
\l\liertz, and also in the mtroductory and biographical note
affixed to the Catalogue Raison11e du Musle Wiertz, by Dr. S.
Watteau, t86s. is to be found a detailed description of an
extremely curious hypnotic O%periment in which "'iertz
was the hypnotic s-ubject and a friend, a doctor, the hypno-
tiscr. Wicrtz had ton~ been haunted by a desire to know
whether thought persJSted in a head severed from the
trunk. His wish was the reason of the following experi-
ment being undertaken, this being facilitated through his
friendship with the prison doctor in Brussels, and another
outside practitioner. The latter had been for many years
a hypnotic operator, and had more -than once put \l\liertz
into the hypnotic state, regarding him as an excellent sub-
ject. About this time a trial for murder in the Place
Saint-Gery had been causing a great sensation in Belgium
and the painter had been following the proceedings closely.
The trial ended in the condemnation of the accused. A
plan was arranged and Wiertz, with the consent of the
prison doctor, obtained pcrmiss10n to hide with his friend,
Dr. D., under the guillotine, close to where the head of the
condemned would roll into the basket. In qrder to carry
out the scheme he bad determined upon more efficiently,
the painter desired his hypnotiser to put him through a
regular course of hyp110tic suggestion, and when in the
sleep state to command him to identify himself with various
people and tell him to read their thoughts and penetrate
into their psychical and mental states. The following is a
resume given in Le Progr~s Spirite :-" On the day of
execution, ten minutes before the arrival of the condemned
man, Wiertz, accompanied by his friend the physician
with two witnesses, ensconced themselves underneath the
guillotine, where they were entirely hidden fmm sight.
The painter was then put to sleep, and told to identify
himself with the criminal. He was to follow his thoughts
and feel any sensations, which he was to express aloud.
He was also 'suggested ' to take special note of mental con-
ditions d ~ring decapitation, so that when the head fell in
the ba;kct he could penetrate the brain and give an account
of its last thoughts. Wiertz became entranced almost
immediately, and the four triends soon understood by the
sounds overhead that the executioner was conducting the
condemned to the scaffold, and in another minute the
guillotine would have done its work. The hypnotized
Wiertz manifested extreme distress and begged to be de-
magnetised, as his sense of oppression was msupportable.
It was too late, however-the knife fell. 'What do you
feel ? What do you see ? ' asks the doctor. Wiertz
writhes convulsively and replies, ' Ughtning ! A thunder-
bolt falls ! It thinks ; it sees ! ' ' "Who thinks and sees ? '
• The head. It suffers horribly. It thinks and feels but
docs not understand what has happened. It seeks its body
and feels that the body must join it. 1t still waits for the
supreme blow for death, but death does not come.' As
W1ertz spoke the witnesses saw the head which had fallen
into the basket and lay looking at them horribly; its
arteries still palpitating. It was only after some moments
of suffering that apparently the guillotined bead at last
became aware that is was separated from its bod y. Wiertz
became calmer and seemed exhausted, while the doctor
resumed his questions. The painter answered :- · I fly
through space like a top spinning through fire. But am I
dead ? Is all over ? If only they would let me join my
body again ! Have pity I give it back to me and I can live
again. I remember all. There are the judges in red
robes. I hear the sentence. Oh I my wretched wife and
children. I am abandoned. If only you would put my
body to me, I should be ·with you once more. You refuse ?
All the same I love you, my poor babies. J\.liserable wrrtch
that I am I have covered you with blood. \Vhen will this
finish !--or is not a murderer condemned to eternal punish-
ment ? ' As Wiertz spoke these words the witnesses thought
they detected the eyes of the decapitated head open wide
with a look of unmistakable suffering and of beseeching.
The painter continued his lamentations. ' No, such
suffering• cannot endure for ever; God is merciful. AU
that belongs to earth is fading away. I see in the distance
a little light glittering like a diamond. I feel a calm steal-
ing over me. What a good sleep I shall have! What
joy ! ' These were the last words the painter spoke. He
\'i'as still entranced, but no longer replied to the questions
put by the doctor. They then approached the head and
Dr. D. touched the forehead, the temples, and teeth and
found they were cold. The head was dead."
In the "Wicrtz Gallery in Brussels are to be found three
pictures of a guillotined head, presumably the outcome
of this gruesome experiment.
Hypocepbalus : A d1sk of bronze or painted linen found
under the heads of Gr;eco-Roman mummies in Egypt.
It is inscribed with magical !ormulre and divine figures, anj
its object was probably to secure warmth for the corpse.
There is frequently depicted upon such amulets a scene
showing cynocephalus apes adoring the solar disk seated in
his boat.
Iaeehus 223 Incubu
I
lacehus : (See Mysteries.)
lao, or 1-ba-bo : A mystic name said by Clement of Alexan-
dria to have been worn on their persons by the initiates of
the Mysteries of Serapis. lt is said to embody the symbols
of the two generative principles.
lebtbyomaney : Divination by the inspection of the entrails of
fish.
Ideas or Good and Evil : (See Yeats.)
Itrits : Hideous spectres probably of Arabian origin, now
genii of Persian and Indian mythology. They assume
diverse forms, and frequent ruins, woods and wild desolate
places, for the purpose of preying upon men and other
living things. They are sometimes confounded with the
Jinns or Divs of Persia.
Ignis Fatuus : A wavering luminous appearance frequently
observed in meadows and marshy places, round which
many popular supcrstions cluster. lts folk-names, Will
o' the Wisp and Jack o' Lantern, suggest a country fellow
bearing a lantern or straw torch (wisp). Formerly these
lights were supposed to haunt desolate bogs and moor-
lands for the purpose of misleading travellers .and drawing
them to their death. Another superstition says that they
are the spirits of those who l1ave been dro,\rned in the bogs,
and yet anot.her, that they are t.he souls of unbaptized in-
fants. Science refers these ignes fatui to gaseous exhalations
from themoist ground,or, morerarely, to nigbt-fiyioginsects.
Illuminati : The term used first of all in the rsth century by
enthusiasts in the occult arts signifying those who claimed
to possess " light " directly communicated from a higher
source, or due to a larger measure of human wisdom.
We first find the name in Spain about the end of the rsth
century. Its origin is probably a late Gnostic one hailing
from Italy, and we find all sorts of people, many of them
charlatans, claiming to belong to the brotherhood. In
Spain, such persons as laid claim to the title had to face the
rigour of the Inquisition, and this is perhaps the reason that
we find numbers of them in France in the early seventeenth
century, as refugees.
Here and there small bodies of those called lflumi11ati,
sometimes known as Rosicrucians rose into publicity for a
short period. But it is with Weishaupt, Professor of Law
at Ingolstadt, that the movement first became identified
with republicanism. It soon secured a strong bold all
through Germany, but its founder's object wa.~ merely to
convert his followers into blind instruments of his supreme
will. He modelled his organisation on that of the Jesuits,
adopted their system of espionage, and their maxim that
the end justified the means. He induced mysticism into the
workings of the brotherhood, so that an air of mystery
might prevade all its doings, adopted many of the classes
and grades of Freemasonry, and held out hopes of the
communication of deep occult secrets in the higher ranks.
Only a few of the members knew him personally, and
thus alth011gh the society had many branches in all parts
of Germany, to these people alone was he visible, and he
began to be regarded by those who had not seen him almost
as a god. He took care to enlist in Ills ranks as many
young men of wealth and position as possible, and within
four or five years the power of Illuminism became extra-
ordinary in its proportions, its members even had a hand
in the affairs of the state, and not a few of the German
princes found it to their interest to having dealings with
the fraternity. Weishaupt's idea was to blend philan-
thropy and mysticism. He was only 28 when be founded
the sect in 1776, but he did not make much progress until
a certain baron Von Knigge joined him in 178o. A gifted
person of strong imagination he bad been admitted master
of most of the secret societies of his day, among them
Freemasonry. He was also an expert occultist and the
su~rnatural had strong attractions for him. These two,
rap1dly spread the gospel of the Revolution throughout
Germany. But they grew fearful that if tbe authorities
discovered tt.e existence of such a society as theirs they
would take steps to suppress it. With this in view they
conceived .the idea of grafting it on to Freemasonry, which
they coll.Sldered would protect it, and offer it means of
spreading more widely and rapidly.
The Freemasons were not long in discovering the true
nature of those who had just joined their organisation. A
chief council ·was held "'i.th the view of thoroughly examin-
ing into the nature of the beliefs held by them and a con-
ference of masons was held in 1782 at wlllch I<:nigge and
WeiShaupt attended and endeavoured to capture the whole
organisation of Freemasonry, but a misunderstanding grew
up between the leaders of iUuminism. Knigge withdrew
from the society, and two years later those who had reached
its highest grade and had discovered that mysticism was not
its true object, denounced it to the Bavarian Government
as a political society of a dangerous character. Weishaupt
fied, but the damage had been done, for the fire kindled by
Illuminism was soon to burst forth in the French Revolution.
The title lllt<minafi was later given to the French Mar-
tinist.s (q.v.)
Imbetep : An Egyptian deity, son of Ptab and Nut, to
whom great powers of exorcism were attributed. He was
often appealed to in cases of demoniac possession.
Imperat~r : Control of Rev. W. S. Moses. (See Moses,
WiUiam Stainton.)
Impersonation : Mediums who are controlled by the spirit
of a deceased person frequently impersonate that person,
imitate his voice and gestures, his physical peculiarities and
manners, and exhibit the symptoms of any disease from
which he may have suffered. (See Trance Personalities.)
Incense, 1\faglcal : (See Ma~;ic.)
Irieommunieable Axiom, '1 he : It was believed that all
magical science was cmt-odied in knowl~dge of this
secret. The Axiom is to be found euclosed in the four
letters of the Tetragram arran!fed in a certain way ; in the
words " Azoth " and ·• Inn " written kabalistically;
a.nd in the monogram of Christ embroidered in the labarum.
He who suc·ceeded in elucidating it became humanly omni-
potent from the magical standpoint.
Incubus : A spirit which has intercourse "'i.tb mortal women.
The concept may have arisen from the idea of the com-
merce of gods with women, rife in pagan times. For,
modern and medireval instances, we can do little more than
refer to the pages in which they may be found, and the very
names of the writers will sufficiently avouch their credibility.
'Jihe history of Hector Boethius bas three or four r.otable
examples. which obtain confirmation from the pen of
Cardan. One of these we may venture to transcribe in the
quaint dress which Holinshed had given it. " In the year
1480 it chanced as a Scottish ship departed out of the Forth
towards Flanders, there arose a wonderful great tempest of
wind and weather, so outragious, that the maister of the
ship, with other the mariners, woondered not a little what
the matter ment, to see such weather at that time of the
yeare, for it was about the middest of summer. At length,
when the furious pirrie and rage of winds still increased, in
such wise that all those within the ship looked for present
death, there was a woman underneath the hatches called
unto them above, and willed them to throw her into the
sea, that all the residue, by God's grace, might yet be
saved ; and thereupon told them how she had b~n haunted
a long time with a St>irit dailie comming unto hir in man's
likenesse. Jn the sh1p there chanced also to be priest, who
by the maister's appointment going down to this woman,
and finding ber like a. most wretched and desperate person,
Incubus 224
lamenting hir great misfortune and miserable estate, used
such wholesome admonition and comfortable advertise-
ments, willing her to repent and hope for mercy at the
hands of God, that, at length, she seeming right penitent
for her grievous offences committed, and fetching sundrie
sighs even from the bottome of her heart, being witnesse, as
should appeare, of the same, there issued forth of the pumpe
of the ship, a foule and evil-favoured blacke cloud with a
mighty terrible noise, .ftarne, smoke, and stinke, which
presently fell into the sea. And suddenlie thereupon the
tempest ceassed, and the ship passing in great quiet the
residue of her journey, arrived in saftieat the placewhither
she was bound." ('Chronicles.' vol. v., 146, Ed. x8o8).
In another case related by the same author, the Incubus did
not depart so quietly. In the chamber of a young gentle-
woman, of excellent beauty, and daughter of a nobleman
in the country of Mar, was found at an unseasonable hour,
•· a foule monstrous thing. verie horrible to behold.'' for
the Jove of which " Deformed " nevertheless, the lady had
refused sundry wealthy marriages. A priest who was in
the company began to repeat St. John's Gospel, and ere he
had proceeded far " suddenlie the wicked spirit, making
a verie sore and terrible roaring noise, flue his waies, taking
the rooie of the chamber awaie with him, the hangings
and coverings of the bed being also burnt therewith."
Erastus, in his Tract "de Lainiis," Sprangerus, who
assures us that himself and Ills four colleagues punished
many old women of Ratisbon with death for this commerce,
Za.nchius (" de Operibus Dei," xvi., 4.) ; Dandidas (" in
Aristotelis de Anima," ii., 29, 30) ; Reussus (v., 6); Godel-
man (ii., 5) ; Valesius (" de Sacra Phil.," 40) ; and Delrio,
·• passim," among others, will satiate the keenest curiosity
on these points. From Bodinus, we learn that Joan
Hervilleria, at twelve years of age, was solemnly betrothed
to Beelzebub, by her mother, who was afterwards burnt
alive for compassing this clandestine marriage. The
bridegroom was very respectably attired, and the marriage
formulary \Vas simple. The mother pronounced the follow-
ing words to the bridegroom : "Ecce 1iliam meam quam
spospondi tibi,'' and then turning to the bride, " Ecce
amicum tuum qoi beabit te." It appears. however, that
Joan was not satisfied with her spiritual husband alone,
but became a bigamist, by inter-marrying with real flesh
and blood. Besides this lady, we read of Margaret Ere-
mont, who. in company with her mother, Joan Robert,
Jo:l.n Guillemin, Mary, wife of Simon Agnus, and Wilhelma,
spouse of one Grassus, were in the habit of attending dia-
bolic assignations. These unhappy wretches were burnt
alive by Adrian Ferreus, General Vicar of ·the Inquisition.
:Villgdalena Crucia of Cordova, an abbess, was more
for.unate. In 1545 she became S\lspected by her nuns of
m:tgic, an accusation ver)' convenient when a superior was
at all troublesome. She encountered them with great
wisdom by anticipating their charge ; and going before-
hand to the Pope, Paul III., she confessed a thirty years'
intimate acquaintance with the devil, and obtained his
pardon. (Sec England.)
India : Mystical Systems.-It would be beyond the scope of
such a work as this to undertake to provide any account
of the several religious systems of India, and we must
confine ourselves to a. description of the mysticism and
demonology which cluster round these systems, and an
outline .Jlf the ma1,ric· and sorcery of the native peoples of
the empire.
Hinduism.-It may be said that the mysticism of the
Hindus was a reaction against the detailed and practical
ceremonial of the Vedas. If its trend were summarised tt
might justly be said that it partakes strongly of disinter-
estcd!les~ ; is a pantheistir. identifying of subject and
object, worshipper and worship ; aims at ultimate absorp·
IndJa
tion in the Infinite; mculcates absolute passivity, the
most minute self-examination, the cessation of the physical
powers ; and believes in the spiritual guidance of the
mystical adept. For the Indian theosophists there is
only one Absolute Being, the One Reality. True, the
pantheistic doctrine of Ekam advitiyam " the One without
Second " posits a countless pantheon of gods, great and
small, and a rich demonology ; but it has to be understood
that these are merely illusions ot the soul and not realities.
Upon the soul's coming to fuller knowledge, its illusions
are totally dispelled. but to the ordinary man the imper-
sona.lity of absolute being is useless. He requires a sym-
bolic deity to bridge the gulf betwixt the impersonal
Absolute and his very material self, hence the numerous
gods of Hinduism which are regarded by the initiated
merely as manifestations of the Supreme Spirit. Even
the rudest forms of idolatry in this way possess hi.gher
meaning. As Sir Alfred Lyall says : " It (Brahminism)
treats all the worships as outward visible signs of the
same spiritual truth, and is ready to show how each par-
ticular image or rite is the symbol of some aspect of univer-
sal divinity. The Hindus, like the pagans of antiquity
adore natural objects and forces,-a mountain, a river, or
an animal. The Brahmin holds all nature to be the vesture
or cloak of indwelling divine energy which inspires every-
thing that prcduces i\ll or pa~ses man's understanding."
The life ascetic bas !rom the remotest times been re·
garded in 11rdia as the truest preparation for communion
with the deity. Asceticism is extremely prevalent
especially in connection with the cult of Siva, who is in
great measure regarded as the prototype of this class. The
Yogis or Jogis (disciples of the Yogi philosophy), practise
mental abstraction, and are popularly supposed to attain
to superhuman powers. The usual results of their ascetic
prachces are madness or mental vacancy, and their so-
called supernatural powers are mostly prophetic, or in too
many cases pure jugglery and conjuring. The Parama-
Hamsas, that is " supreme swans" claim to be identical
with the world-soul, and have no occupation except medita-
tion on Brahma. They are said to be equally indifferent
to pleasure or pain, insensible to heat or cold, and incapable
of satiety or want. The Sa.nnyasis are those who renounce
terrestrial affairs : they are of the character of monks,
and are as a general rule extremely dirty. The Da!ldis or
staff-bearers arc worshippers of Siva in his form of Bhai·
rava the Terrible. i\Ir. J. C. Owen in his .l.Iystics, Ascetics
and Sects of India says of these So.dhus or holy men :-
" Sadhuism whether perpetuating the peculiar idea of the
efficacy of asceticism for the acquisition of far-reaching
powers over natural phenomena or bearing its testimony
to the belief of the indispensableness of detachment from
the world as a preparation for the ineffable joy of ecstatic
communion with the Divine Being, has undoubtedly
tended to keep before men's eyes as the highest ideal, a
life of purity and restraint and contempt of the world of
human affairs. It has also necessarily maintained amongst
the laity a sense of the rights and claims of the poor upon
the charity of the more opulent members of the community.
Further, Sadhuism by the multiplicity of the independent
sects which have arisen in India bas engendered and
favoured a spirit of tolerance which cannot escape the
notice of the most superficial observer."
One of the most esoteric branches of Hinduism is the
Sakta cult. The Saktas are worshippers of the Sakti or
female principle as a creative and reproductive agency.
Each of the principal gods possesses hls own Sakti, through
which his creative acts are performed, so that the Sakta
worshippers are dr:w·n from all sects. But it is principally
in connection with the cult of Siva that Sakta worship is
practised. Its principal seat is the north-eastern part of
India 225
India-Bengal, BehaT and Assam. It is divided into two
distinct groups. The original self-existent gods were sup-
posed to divide themselves into male and female energies. the
male half occupying the right-hand and the female the left-
hand sicte. From this conception we have the two groups
{)f " right-hand " observers and " left-hand " observers.
In the TanJra.s or mystical writings, Siva unfolds in the
nature of a colloquy in answer to questions asked by his
spouse Parvati, the mysteries of Sakta occultism. The
right-hand worshippers are by far the most numerous.
Strict secrecy is enjoined in the performance of the rites,
and only one minor caste, the Kanlas, carry on the mystic
and degraded rites of the Tantra.s.
Brahmanism.-Brahmanism is a system originated by
the Brahmans, the sacerdotal caste of the Hindus, at a
-comparatively early date. It is the mystical religion of
India par excellence, and represents the more archaic
beliefs of its peoples. It states that the numberless
jndividual existences of animate nature are but so many
manifestations of the one eternal spirit towards which they
tend as their final goal of supreme bliss. The object of
man is to prevent himself sinking lower in the scale, and by
degrees to raise himself in it, or if possible to attain the
ultimate goal immediately from such state of existence as
he happens to be in. Tbe code of Manu concludes " He
who in his own soul perceives the supreme soul in all
beings and acquires equanimity towards them all attains
the highest state of bliss." lVIortification of animal
instincts, absolute purity and perfection of spirit, were the
moral ideals of the Brahman class. But it was necessary
to pass through a succession of four orders or states of
existence ere any hope of union with the deity could be held
out. These were : that of brahmiUharin, or student of
religious matters; grihastha, or householder; vanavasin,
or hermit ; and sannyasit1 or bhikshu, fakir or religious
mendicant. Practically every man of the higher castes
practised at least the first two of these stages, while the
priestly class took the entire course. Later, however,
this was by no means the rule, as the scope of study was
intensely exacting, often lasting as long as forty-eight
years, and the neophyte had to support himself by begging
from door to door. He was usually attached to the house
of some religious teacher : and after several years of his
tuition was usually married, as it was considered absolutely
essential that he should leave a son behind him to offer
food to his spirit and to those of his ancestors. He was then
said to have become a " Householder " and was required
to keep up perpetually the fire brought into his bouse upon
his marriage day. Upon his gro·wing older, the time for
him arrived to enter the third stage of life, and he " cut
himself off from all family ties except that (if she wished}
his wife might accompany him, and went into retirement
in a lonely place, carrying with him his sacred fire, and the
instruments necessary to his daily sacrifices." Scantiiy
clothed. and with hair and nails uncut, it is set down that
the anchorite must live entirely on food gro·wing wild in
the forest-roots, herbs, wild grain, and so forth. The
acceptance of gifts was not permitted him unless absolutely
necessa~y. and his time was spent in reading the metaphysi-
cal porhons of the Veda. in making offerings, and in practis-
ingausterities with the object ofproducing entire in~ifference
to worldly desires. In this way he fits himself for the final
and most exalted order, that of religious mendicant or
bhikshu. This consists solely of meditation. He takes up
his abode at the foot of a tree in entire solitude, and only
once ~ day at the end of their. labours may he go near the
dwelbngs of men to beg a httle food. In this way he
waits for death, neither desiring extinction nor existence,
until at length it reaches him, and he is absorbed in the
eternal Brahma.
India
The purest doctrines of Brahmanism are to be found in
the Vedanta philosophic system, which recognises the
Veda, or collection of ancient Sanskrit hymns, as the
revealed source of religious belie! through tbe visions of
the ancient Rishts or seers. It bas been already mentioned
that theHindu regarded thcentiregamutof animated nature
as being traversed by the one soul, which journeyed up
and down the scale as its actions in its previous existence
were good or evil. To the Hindu the vital element in all
animate beings appears essentially similar, and this led
directly to the Brahmanical theory of transmigration,
which has taken such a powerful bold upon the Hindu
mind.
Denwno!ogy.-A large and intricate demonology has
clustered around Hindu mythology. The gods are at con-
stant war with demons. Thus Durga slays Chanda and
Asura, and also des,Patches Durga, a fiend of similar name
to herself. Vishnu also slays more than one demon, but
Durga appears to have been a great enemy of the demon
race. The Asuras, probably a very ancient and aboriginal
pantheon of deities, later became demons in the popular
imagination, and the Rakshasas were ciQud-demons. They
are described as cannibals, could take any form, and were
constantly menacing the gods. They haunt cemeteries,
disturb sacrifices, animate the dead, harry and afflict
mankind in all sorts of ways. In fact they are almost an
absolute parallel with the vampires of Slavonic countries;
and tlris greatly assists the conclusioiiS of Asikoff that the
Slavonic vampires were originally cloud-spirits. We find
tbe gods constantly harassed by demons ; and on the
whole we may be justified in concluding that just as the
Tuatha-de-danaan harassed the later deities of Ireland, so
did these aboriginal gods lead an existence of constant
warfare vvith the divine beings of the pantheon of the
immigrant Aryans.
Popular Witchcraft and Sorcery.-The ~pular Wltch-
craft and sorcery of India greatly resembles that of Europe.
The Dravidian or aboriginal races of I11dia have always
been strong believers in witchcraft, and it is possible that
here we have an example of the mythic inftuence of a
conquered ~pie. They are, however, extremely reticent
regarding any knowledge they possess of it. It is practi-
cally confined to them, and this might lead to the hasty
supposition that the Aryan races of India ~ssess no
witchcraft of their own. But this is strongly unlikely, and
the truth probably lies quite in the other direction; how-
ever, the extraordinarily high demands made upon the
popular religious sense by Brahmall.ism probably crushed
the superstitions of the lower cultus of a very early period.
and confined the practice of minor sorcery to the lower
tastes, who were of course of Dravidian or aboriginal
blood. We find witchcraft most prevalent among the more
isolated and least advanced races, like the Kols, Bhils,
and Santals. The nomadic peoples are also strong believers
in sorcery, one of the most dreaded forms of which is the
]igar Kflor, or liver-eater, of whom Abu! Fazl says:-
" One of this class can steal away the liver of another
by looks and incantations. Other accounts say that by
looking at a. l?erson he deprives him of his senses, and then
steals from him something resembling the seed of a pome-
granate, which he hides in the calf of his leg ; after being
swelled by the fire, he distributes it among his fellows to
be eaten, which ceremonyconcludes the life of the fascinated
person. A jigar KJ.or is able to communicate his art to
another by teaching him incantations, and by making him
eat a bit of the liver <'ake. These Jigar Khors are mostly
women. It is said they can bring intelligence from a long
distance in a short space of time, and if they are thrown
into a river with a stone tied to them, they nevertheless
·will not sink. In order to det>rive any one of this wicked
India 226
power, they brand his temph~s and every joint of his body,
cram his eyes with salt, suspend him for forty days in a
subterranean chamber, and repeat over him certain incan-
tations." The witch docs not, ho,vcver, dev<,ar the man's
liver for two and a half davs, and even if she has eaten it,
and is put under the hands of an exorciser, she can be
forced to substitute a liver of some animal in the body of
the man '"hom she victimised. We also hear tales of
witches taking out the entrails of people, sucking them,
and then replacing them. All this undoubtedly illustrates,
as in ancient France and Germany, and probably also in
the Slavonic countries, the original combination of witch
and vampire ; how, in fact, the two were one and the
same. In India the arch-\vitch Ralaratri, or " black
night " bas the joined eyebrows of the Salvonic werewolf
or vampire, large checks, widely-parted lips. projecting
teeth, and is a veritable vampire. But she also possesses
the powers of ordinary witeheraft.~econd-sight, the
making of philtres, the control of tempests, the evil eye, and
so forth. Witches also take animal forms, especially those
of tigers ; and stories of trials are related at \vhich natives
gave evidence that they had tracked certain tigers to their
lairs, which upon entering they had found tenanted by a
a notorious witch or wizard. For such witch-tigers the
usual remedy is to knock out their teeth to prevent their
doing any more mischief. Strangely enough the Indian
witch, like her European prototype, is very often accom-
panied by a cat. The cat, say the jungle people, is
aunt to the tiger, and taught him everthing but how to
climb a tree. Zalim Sinh, the famous regent of Kota,
believed that cats were associated with witches, and imagin-
ing himself enchanted ordered that every cat should be
expelled from his province.
As in Europe, witches are kno,vn by certain marks.
They are believed to learn the secrets of their craft by
eating offal of all kinds. The popular belief concerning
them is that they are often very handsome and neat, and
invariably apply :1. clear line of red lead to the parting
of their hair. They arc popularly accused of exhuming
dead children, and bringing them to life to sen·e occult
purpose.3 of their own. They cannot die so long as they are
witches, and until, as in Italy, they can pass on their
knowledge of witchcri\ft to someone else. They recite
charms backwards, repeating two letters and a half from a
verse in the J(oYan. lf a certain charm is repeated " for-
wards," the person employing it will become im~sible to
his neighbour, but if he repeats it backwards, he will
assume whatever shape he chooses. A witch can acquire
power over her victim by getting possession of a lock of
hair, the paring of nails, or some other part of his body,
such as a tooth. .For this reason natives of India are
extremely careful about the disposal of such, burying them
in the earth in a place covered with grass, or in the neigh-
bourhood of water, which witches universally dislike.
Some people even ili.ng the cuttings of their hair into
running water. Like the witches of Europe too, they are
in. the practice of making images of persons out of wax,
dough, or similar substances, and torturing them, with the
idea that the pain wilt be felt by the person whom they
desire to injure. In India the vo'itchcs' familiar is known
as Bir or the " hero," who aids her to inflict injury upon
human beings. The power of the witch is greatest on the
14th, 15th and 29th of each month, and in particular on
the Feast of Lamps, and the Festival of Durga.
Witches are often severely punished amongst the isolated
hill-folk and a diabolical ingenuity is shown in torturing
them. To nullify their evil inB.uencc, they arc beaten with
rods of the castor-oil plant and usually die in the process.
They are often forced to drink filthy water used by curriers
in the process of their work, or their noses are cut off, or
India
they are put to death. As has been said, their teeth are-
often knocked out, their heads shaved and offal is thrown
at them. In the case of women their heads are shaved
and their hair is attached to a tree in some public place.
They are also branded ; have a ploughshare tied to their
legs ; and made to drink the water of a tannery. During
the Mutiny, when British authority was relaxed, the most
atrocious horrors were inflicted upon witches and sorcerers
by the Dravidian people. Pounded chilli peppers were
placed in th~ir eyes to see if they would bring tears, and
the wretched beings were suspended from a tree head
downwards, being swung violently from side to side. They
were then forced to drink the blood of a goat, and to
exorcise the evil spirits that they had caused to enter the
bodies of certain sick persons. The mutilations and
cruelties practised on them arc such as will not bear repeti-
tion, but one of the favourite ways of counteractlngthe
spells of a witch is to draw blood from her, and the local
priest will often prick the tongue of the witch with a.
needle, and place the resulting blood on some rice and
compel her to eat it.
Tn Bomb:~.y, the aboriginal Tharus are supposed to
possess special powers of witchcraft, so that the " Land
of Tharus " is a synonyrn for witch-land. In Gorakhpur,
witches arc also very numerous, and the half-gypsy Ban-
jaras, or grain-carriers, are notorious believers in witch-
craft. Tn his interesting Popular Religion a•zd Folk-lore
of Northern India, Mr. W. Crooke, who has had exceptional
opportunities for the study of the native character, and
who has done much to clear up the dark places of Indian
popular mythology. says regarding the various types of
Indian witches :-
.. At the present day the half-deified witch most dreaded
in the Eastern Districts of the North-western Provinces
is Lona., or Nona, a Chamarin or woman of the currier
caste. Her legend is in this wise. The great physician
Dhanwantara, who corresponds to Luqman Hakim of the
Muhammadans, was once on his way to cure King Parikshit,
and was deceived and bitten by the snake king Takshaka.
He therefore desired his son~ to roast him and eat his
flesh, and thus succeed to his magical powers. The snake
king dissuaded them from eating the unholy meal, and they
let the cauldron containing it float down the Ganges. A
currier \t"Oman. named Lona, found it and ate the contents,
and thus succeeded to the mystic powers of Dhanwantara.
She became skilful in cures, particularly of snake-bite.
Finally she was discovered to be a witch by the extra-
ordinary rapidity with which she could plant out rice
seedlings. One day the people watched her, and saw that
when she believed herself unobserved she stripped herself
naked, and taking the bundle of the plants in her hands
threw them into the air, reciting certain spells. When the
seedlings forthwith arranged themselves in their proper
places, the spectators called out in a~tonishment, and
finding herself discovered, Nona rushed along over the
country, and the channel which she made in h~r C()urse is
the Loni river to this day. So a saint in Broach formed a
new 'course for a river by dragging his clothes behind
him..... .
" Another terrible witch, whose le~end is told at .1\:[athura,
is Putana, the daughter of Bali, king of the lower world.
She found the infant Krishna asleep, and began to suckle
him with her devil's milk. The first drop would have
poisoned a mortal child, but Krishna drew her breast
with such strength that he drained her life-blood, and the
fiend, terrifying the whole land of Braj ·with her cries of
as-ony, fell lifeless on the ground. European 'ili.tches suck
the blood of children ; here the divine Krishna turns the
tables on the witch.
" The Palwar Rajputs of Oudh have a witch ancestress.
India 227 Insufflation
Soon after the birth of her son she was engag~d in baking
cakes. Her infant began to cry, and she was obliged to
perform a double duty. At this juncture her husband
arrived just in time to see his demon wife assume gigantic
and supernatural proportions, so as to allow both the
baking and nursing to go on at the same time. But
finding her secret discovered, the witch disappeared,
leaving her son as a legacy to her astonished husband.
Here, though the story is incomplete, we have almost
certainly, as in the case of Nona Chamarin, one of the
Melusina type of legend, where the supernatural wife
leaves her husband and children, because he violated some
taboo, by which he is forbidden to see her in a state of
nudity, or the like.
" The history of witchcraft in Indta, as in Europe, is
one of the saddest pages in the annals of the people. Nowa-
days, the power of British law has almost entirely sup-
pressed the horrible outrages which, under the native
administration were habitually P-ractised. But particu-
larly in the more remote and unciVIlized parts of the country
this superstition still exists in the minds of the people
and occasional indications of it, which appear in our
criminal records, are quite sufficient to show that any
relaxation of the activity of our magistrates and police
would undoubtedly lead to its revival in some of its more
shocking forms."
The aborigines of fndia live in great fear of ghosts and
invisible spirits. and a considerable portion of their time
is given up to averting the evil inftuenccs of these. Pro-
tcctives of every description litter their houses, and the
approaches to them, and they wear numerous amulets for
the purpose of averting evil influences. Regarding these,
Mr. Crooks says :-
.. Some of the Indian ghosts, like the lfrit of the Arabian
Nights, can grow to the length of tenyoja11as or eighty miles.
In one of the Bengal tales a ghost is identiiied because she
can stretch out her hands several yards for a vessel. Some
ghosts possess the very dangerous power of entering human
corpses, like the Vetala, and swelling to an enormous size.
The Kharwars of Mirzapur have a wild legend, which tells
how long ago an unmarried girl of the tribe died, and was
being cremated. While the relations were co.llecting wood
for the pyre, a ghost entered the corpse, but the friends
managed to expel him. Since then great care is taken not
to leave the bodies of women unwatched. So, in the
Pa.njab, when a great person is cremated the bones and
ashes are carefully watched till the fourth day, to prevent a
magician interfering with them. I! he has a chance, he
can restore the deceased to life, and ever after retain him
under his influence. This is the origin of the custom in
Great Britain of waking the dead, a practice which •most
probably originated from a silly superstilion as to the
danger of a corpse oeing carried off by some of the agents
of the invisible world, or exposed to the ominous liberties
of brute animals.· But in India it is considered the best
course, if the corpse cannot be immediately disposed of,
to measure it carefully, and then no malignant Bhut can
occupy it.
" Most of the ghosts whom we have been as yet con·
sidering arc malignant. There are, however, others which
are friendly. Such arc the German E lves, the Robin Good-
fellow, Puck, Brownie and the Cauld Lad of Hilton of
England, the Glasban of the Isle of Man, the Phouka or
Lcprehaun of Ireland. Such, in one of his many forms, is
the Brahmadaitya, or ghost of a Brahman who has died
unmarried. In Bengal he is believed to be more neat and
less mischievous than other ghosts; the Bhuts carry him
in a palanquin, he vtears wooden sandals, and lives in a
Banyan tree.
Infernal Court.-Wierus and others, learned in the lore of
the itifernal regions, have discovered therein princes and
high dignitaries, ministers, ambassadors, and officers of
state, whose names would fill much space to little purpose
Satan is no longer the soverign o£ Hades, but is, so to
speak, leader of the opposition. The true leader is Beelze-
bub.
Initiation : The process of entry into a secret society or
similar organisation. The idea of initiation was certainly
inherited by the Egyptians and Asssyrians from older
neoblithic peoples, who possessed secret organisations or
"mysteries" analogous to those of the Medwiwin of the
North American Indians or those of the Australian Black-
fellows. We read of initiation into the various grades of
the Egyptian priesthood and the " mysteries " of Eleusis
and Bacchus. (See Mysteries.) These processes prob-
ably consisted of tests of courage and fidelity (as do
the savage initiations) and included such acts as sustaining
a severe buffeting, the drinking of blood, real and imagin-
ary, and so forth. In tho PopoJ Vuh, the saga of the
Kiche Indians of Guatemala we have a picture of the initia-
tion tests o£ two hero-gods on entrance to the native
Hades. Indeed, most of the mysteries typified the descent
of man into Hell, and his return to earth, based on the
corn-mother legend of the resurrection of the wheat plant.
Initiation into the higher branches of mysticism, magic
and theosophy has been largely written upon The
process in regard to these is of course entirely sym-
bolical, and is to be taken as implying a preparation for
the higher life and the regeneration of the soul.
Institor, Henricus : (See Malleus liJale!lcarum.)
Instruments, .Magical : {See Magic.)
Insumation, says Eliphas Levi, " is one of the most impor-
tant practices of occult medicine, because it is a perfect
sign of the transmission of life. To inspire, as a fact, means
to breath upon some person or thing, and we kno\v already,
by the one doctrine o! Hermes, that the virtue of things has
created words, and that there is an exact proportion
between ideas and speech, which is the first form and
verbal realisation of ideas. The breath attracts or repels,
according, as it is warm or cold. The warm breathing
corresponds to positive electricity, and the cold breathing
to negative electricity. Electrical and nervous animals
fear the cold breathing, and the experiment may be made
upon a cat, whose familiarities arc important. By fixedly
regarding a lion or tiger and blowing in their face, they
would be so stupefied as to be forced to retreat before us.
Warm and prolonged in'>ufftation restores the circulation
of the blood, cures rheumatic and gouty pains, re-estab-
lishes the balance of the humours, and dispels lassitude.
When the operator is sympathetic and good, it acts as a
universal sedative. Cold i1uuff1ation soothes pains occa-
sioned by congestions and lfuidic accumulations. The
two breathings must, therefore, be used alternately,
observing the polarity of the human organis~. and acting
in a contrary manner upon the poles, which must be
treated successfully to an opposite magnetism. Thus, to
cure an indamed eye, the one which is not affected must be
subjected to a warm and gentle -insufflation, cold insuffla-
tion being practised upon the suffering member at.the same
distance and in the same proyortion. Magnetic passes
have a similar effect to insu_Jfla:•ons, and .are ~ rea! brea~h­
ing by transpiration and rad1ation of the 1ntenor a.Jr, "":hich
is phosphorescent with vital light ; slow passes cons~1~te
a warm breathing which fortifies and raises the spmts ;
swift passes are a cold breathing of dispersive .nature,
neutralising tendencies to cougestion. Tbe warm msuifia-
tion should be performed transversely, or from below
upward ; the cold insufflation is more effective when
directed downward from above. '
Intuitional World 228
Intuitional World : Formerly known as the Buddhic Plane.
is in the theosophic scheme the fourth world, and from it
come intuitions. (See Theosophy, Solar System, and
Intuition).
Invocation : (See llecromancy.)
Ireland : For information regarding ancient Ireland See
" Celts." Although nominally Christianised, there is
little doubt that the early medireval Irish retained many
relics of their former condition of paganism, especially
those which possessed a magical tendency. This is made
clear by the writings of Giraldus Cambrensis, the first
account we have of Irish manners and customs after the
invasion of the country by the Anglo-Kormans. His
description, for example, of the Purgatory of St. Patrick in
Lough Derg, Co. Donegal, proves that the demonology of
the Catholic Church had already fused with the animism
of Irish native heathnessc. He says :-
" There is a lake in Ulster containing an island divided
into two parts. In one of these stands a church of especial
sanctity. and it is most agreeable and delightful, as well as
beyond measure glorious for the visitations of angels and
the multitude of the saints who visibly frequent it. The
other part, being covered with rugged crags, is reported to
be the resort of devils only, and to be almost always the
theatre on which crowds of evil spirits visibly perform their
rites. This part of the isl:\nd contains nine pits, and
should any one perchance venture to spend the night 1n one
of them (which llas been done, we know, at times, by some
rash men), be is immediately seized by the malignant
spirits, who so severely torture him during the whole
night, inflicting on him such unutterable sufierings by
fire and water, and other torments of various kinds, tha~
when morningcomes scarcely anyspark of life is found leftin
his wretched body. It is said that any one who has once
submitted to these torments as a penance imposed upon
him, will not after·o\•ards undergo the pains of beU. unless
he commit some sin of a deeper dye.
" This place is called by the natives the Purgatory of St.
Patrick. For he, having to argue with a heathen race
concerning the torments of hell, reserved for the reprobate,
and the real nature and eternal duration of the future
life, in order to impress on the rude minds of the unbelievers
a mysterious faith in doctrines so new. so strange. ~o
opposed to their prejudices, procured by the efficacy of
his prayers an exemplification of both states even on earth,
as a salutary lesson to the stubborn minds of the people."
The ancient Irish believed in the possibility of the trans·
formation of human beings into animals. and Giraldus in
another narrative of facts purporting to have come under
his personal notice proves that this belief had lost none of
its significance with the Irish of the latter half of the twelfth
century. The case is also interesting as being one of the
first recorded examples o{ lycanthropy (q.v.) in the British
Isles. and that must be our excuse for quoting it at some
length.
"About three years before the arrival of Earl John in
Ireland, it chanced that a priest, who was journeying
from Ulster towards Meath, was benighted in a certain
wood on the borders of Meath. \Vhile, in company with
only a young lad, he was watching by a fire which he had
kindled under the branches of a spreading tree, lo ! a
wolf came up to them, and immediately addressed them to
this effect : ' Rest secure, and be not afraid, for there is no
reason you should fear, where no fear is! ' The travellers
being struck with astonishment and alarm, the wolf added
some orthodox words referring to God. The priest then
implored him, and adjured him by Almighty God and
faith in the Trinity, not to hurt them, but to inform them
what creature it was in the shape of a beast uttered human
words. The wolf. after giving catholic replies to all
Ireland
questions. added at last : ' There arc two of us. a man and
a woman, natives of Ossory, who. through the curse of
Katalis, saint and abbot, arc compelled every seven years
to put off the human form, and depart from the dwellings
of men. Quitting entirely the human form, we assume
that o{ wolves. At the end of the seven years. if they
chance to survive, two others being substituted in their
places. they return to their country and their former shape.
And now, she who is my partner in this visitation lies
dangerously sick not far from hence, and, as she is at the
point of death, I beseech you, inspired by divine charity,
to give her the consolations of yonr priestly office.'
" At this wood the priest followed the wolf trembling, as he
led the way to a tree at no great distance, in the hollow
of which he beheld a she·wolf, who under that shape was
pouring forth human sighs and groans. On seeing the
priest, having saluted him with human courtesy. she gave
thanks to God. who in this extremity had vouchsafed to
visit her with such consolation. She then received from
the priest ?.ll the rites of the church duly performed, as
far as the last communion. This also she importunately
demanded, earnestly supplicating him to c.omplete his
good offices by giving her the viaticum. The priest
stoutly asserting that he was not provided with it, the
be·wolf, who had withdrawn to a short distance, came
back and pointed out a small missal-book, containing
some consecrated wafers, which the priest carried on his
journey, suspended from his neck, under his garment, after
the fashion oi the country. He then intreated him not to
deny them the gift of <Jod, and the aid-destined for them
by Divine Providence ; and. to remove aU doubt, using
his claw for a hand, he tore off the skin of the she-wolf,
from the head down to the navel, folding it back. Thus
she immediately presented the form of an old woman.
The priest, seeing this, and compelled by his fear more than
his reason. gave the communion ; the recipient having
earnestly implored it. and devoutly partaking of it.
Immediately afterwards the he·woll rolled back the skin
and fitted it to its original form.
"These rites having been duly, rather than rightly
performed, the he·wol£ gave them his company during
the whole night at their little fire, behaving more like a
man than a beast. When morning came, he led them out
of the wood. and, leaving the priest to pursue his journey
pointt>d out to him the direct road for a long distance. At
his departure, be also gave him many thanks for the benefit
be had conferred, promising him still greater returns of
gratitude, if the Lord should call him back from his present
exile, two parts of which he had already completed."
·• It chanced, about two years afterwards. that I was
passing through Meath, a.t the time when the bishop of that
land bad convoked a synod, hav1ng also invited the assist-
ance of the neighbouring bishops and abbots. in order to
have their joint counsels on what was to be done in the
affair which had come to his knowledge by the priest's
confession. The bishop, bearing that I was passing through
those parts, sent me a message by two of his clerks. request-
ing me. if possible, to be personally present when a matter
of so much importance was under consideration ; but if I
could Pot attend he begged me at least to signify my
opinion in writing. The clerks detailed to me all the cir-
cumstances, which indeed I had heard before from other
persons ; and, as I was prevented by urgent business from
being present at the synod, I made up for my absence by
giving them the benefit of my advice in a letter. The
bisho-p and synod, yic:ding to it, ordered the priest to

"In our own time we have seen persons who, by magical
arts. turned any substance about them into fat pigs, as
~hey appeared (but they were always red), and sold them
tn the markets. However, they disappeared as soon as they
c~ossed any water, returning to their real nature ; and
w_tth whatever care they were kept. their assumed form
d•d not.last beyond th~ec days. It has also been a frequent
com~lamt. fr!3m old times as well as in the present, that
certain hags m W:1les, as well as in Ireland and Scotland
changed themsc.lvcs into the shape of hares, that, sucking
teats under th1s counterfeit form, they might stealthily
rob other people's milk."
In ~~to-Norman times sorcery vras widely practised
?ut notices are sc~ce. ~t is only by fugitive passages
m t?e works of En~li;sh :wntcrs who constantly animadvert
agatnst the superstitious nature and practices of the I6sh
that we glean any information concerning the occult his-
to~y of the country. The great cause cC/ebre of the Lady
Alice Kyteler (q.v.) shook the entire Anglo-Norman
colony during several successive years in the first half of
the fourteenth century. The party of the Bishop of Ossory
the relent!es? opponent of the Lady Alice, boasted that by
her prosecution they had rid Ireland of a nest of sorcerers,
but there is reason to believe that Ireland could have
furnished numerous similar instances of black maaic bad
the actors in them been of similar rank to the ilt-fated
lady-that is of sufficient importance in the eyes of
chroniclers.
In this connection a work on Irish Witchcraft and Demon-
ology by ?.;r. St. John D. Seymour (r913), is of striking and
pregnant 1nterest. We do not gather from it that Mr.
:;eymour had any previous general knowledge of the sub-
Ject he l;landles before writing this book, and he appears
to ta~e 1t for gra~ted that \Yitchcraft in Ireland is purely
an allen system, 1mported into the island by the Analo-
Normans and Scottish immigrants to the north This
undoubtedly is the case so !ar as the districts of the Pale
and of Ulst~ ar~ c~nccrned, but surely it cannot be applied
to the Celtic diStricts of Ireland. Regarding these Mr.
Seymour is silent, but it will occur to most readers that the
analogy of Celtic Scotland, which abounded in witches and
witch-c':lstoms, ~ powcrf~li evidence that a system similar
to t:b:at m vogue m the Highlands obtained in the aboriginal
districts of Ireland, Early Irish works contain numerous
ref~rences to sorcery, and practices arc chronicled in them
whi~. bca.r a close resemblance to those of the shamans and
medicme-men of savage tribes all over the world. Animal
tr!lnsfo~mation, one of the most common feats of the
Witch, 1S alluded to again and again in the ancient Irish
cycles, and t~erc are few heroes in Hibernian legend who
have not a f~r stock <?f working magic at their finger-ends.
"':onder-w~rking dru1ds, too, abound. Mr. Seymour
wLll have 1t that " In Celtic Ireland dealings with the
~nseen were not re~arded with such abhorrence, and
tndeed had the ~~nctlon o~ custom and antiquity." He
al~~ states. that the Celtic element had its own super·
stlttou~ bel~efs, but th~e never developed in this direction"
(th~ d1recti.on of W•tchcra.ft). This is very difficult to
bche':'e· Tnc la~k of records of such a system is no criterion
~hat 1t.neve~ ex1sted, and we have not the least hesitation
1n sa}'lng tnat a thorough examination of the subject
~ould ~;>rove tlut a. veritable system of witchcraft obtained
m CeltiC Ireland as elsewhere, although it may not have
been of " Celtic " origin. •
~ that o.s !t m:~.y, Mr. Seymour's book is most inter-
esting as dealing w1tb those Anglo-Norman and Scottish
portl.?ns of lreland where the belief in witchcraft followed
~e ~acs of those in vogue in the mother-countries of the
1mrrugrant populations. He sketches the cause t;tUbre of the
Ireland
Kyteler case (q.v.), touches on the circumstances con-
nected with the Earl of Desmond and notes the case of the
Irish prophetess who insisted upon warning the ill-fated
James I. of Scotland on the night of his assassination at
Perth. It is not stated by the ancient chronicler, quoted
by Mr. Seymour, from what part of Ireland the witch in
question emanated-for a witch she undoubtedly was
as she possessed a familiar spirit, Hutbart, whom she
alleged had made her cognisant of the coming catastrophe.
l'tfl:. Sey~our do_es not seem to be aware of the history of
this sp1nt. He IS the Teutonic f/udlkin (q.v.) or Hildekin,
the wearer of the hood, sometimes also alluded to as
Hukdekin, well known throughout Germany and Flanders
as a species of house-spirit or brownie. Trithemius alludes
to him as a "spirit known to the Saxons who attached
himself to the Bishop of Hildcsbcim " and we find him
cropping up here and there in occult history. From this
circumstance it might with justice be inferred that the
Wltch in question came from some part of Ireland which
had been settled by Teutonic immigrants, and more
probably from Ulster, but the data is insufficient to permit
us to conclude this definitely.
From the most scanty materials, Mr. Seymour has com-
piled l;\ book of o_utstanding interest. He passes in review
t he wttchcraft tnals of the XVI. century, the burning of
Adam Dubh, of the Leinster trial of O'Toole and College
Green in 1327 for heresy, and the passing of the statute
against witchcraft in Ireland in 1586. The prevalence of
witchcraft in Ireland during the sixteenth century is
proved by him to have been very great indeed, but a
number of the authorities he cites, as to the existence of
sorcerers in the Green Isle, almost certainly refer to the
more Celtic portions of it : for example Rich and Stani-
hurst. He has an excellent note upon the enchantments of
the Earl of Desmond who demonstrated to his young and
beautiul wife the possibilities of animal transformation by
changing himself into a bird, a hag, a vulture, and a gigantic
serpent . Human relations with the Devil are dwelt upon
at length by Mr. Seymour in a racy chapter, and we are told
how he was cheated by a doctor of divinity and raised on
occasion by certain sorcerers. Florence Newton, the
witch of Youghal claims an entire chapter to herself, and
worthily, for her case is one of the most absorbing in the
history of witchcraft. At any rate, whatever her occult
powers, she splendidly succeeded in setting a whole com-
munity by the ears. Ghostly doings and apparitions, fairy
possession,anddealings with the' wee folk' are also included
in the volume; and Mr. Seymour has not confined himself
to Irela11d, but has followed one of his countrywomen to
America, where he shows how she gave congenial employ-
ment to the fanatic Cotton Mather (q.v.). Witchcraft
notices of the seventeenth eeutury in Antrim and Island
Magee comprise the eighth chapter ; and the ninth and last
bring down the affairs of sorcery in Ireland from the year
1807 to the present day. The last notice is that of a trial
for murder in 19II, when a wretched woman was tried for
killing another-an old-age pensioner-in a fit of insanity.
A witness deposed that he met the accused on the road on
the morning of the crime holding a statue or figure in he•
hand, and repeating three times " I have the old witch
killed. I got power from the Dlesscd Virgin to kill her."
It appears that the w;tch quoted in question threatened to
plague the murderess with ra:s <1.nd mice; a single rodent
had evidently penetrated to her &bode, and was followed
by the bright vis:oa of a lady who told the accused that she
was in danger, and furthe: informed her that if she received
the old pensioner's pcnsion-lx>ok witl'.out taking off her
clothes aad cleaning them and putting out her bed and
cleaning up the house. she would ·· receive cirt for ever and
rats and mice." This is not an isolated case, and shov.'S

how hard such ~uperstitions die in the more remote portions
of civilised countries.
We have reviewed Mr. Seymour's book at some length
because it represents pr.actically all that exists on· the
subject in question. But it would be interesting to sec
him further his researches by an examination into such
of the native Irish records as eJtist. Such a course would
most probably result in the rescue of a considerable amount
of detail which would enable him to complete the occult
history of his country.
Iron : Its occult virtues are thus described by Pliny, accord-
ing to Holland :-" As touching the use of Yron and steele
in .Physicke, it serveth otherwise than for to launce. cut,
and dismember withal ; for take the knife or dagger, an
make an ymaginerie circle two or three times round with
the point thereof upon a young child or an elder bodie, and
then goe round withal! about the partie as often, it is a
singular preservative against all poysoos, sorceries, or
enchantments. Also to take any yron naile out of the
coffin or sepulchre wherein man or woman lieth buried, and
to sticke the same fast to the lintle or side post of a dore,
leading either to the house or bed-chamber where any
dooth lie who is haunted with ~ptrits in the night, be or she
shall be delivered and secured from such phanasticall
illusions. Moreover. it is said, that if one be lightly
pricked with the point of sword or dagger, which hath· been
the death of a man, it is an excellent remedy against the
patns of sides or breast, which come with sudden pric)cesor
stitches."
In certain parts of Scotland and the North of Ireland,
there is a belief in the potency of iron tor warding off the
attacks of Uriric>s. An iron poker, laid across a cradle.
will, it is believed. keep the fairies away until the child is
baptised. The Rev. John G. Campbell in his Superstitions
of the Scottish Highlands relates .how when a child, he and
another boy were believed to be protected from a fairy
which had been seen at a certain spot by the possession,
the one oi a knife, and the other of a nail. This was at
Appin in Argyllshire.
Irving's Church, Speaking witb Tongues in : In t83t an
outbreak of speaking with tongues occurred in the con-
gregation of Edward Irving, in London. For several
years Irving had wa1ted for such a visitation. and had
instituted special early-morning services for the purpose
of hastening it. At length. in July, t83t, the" visitation"
came, first one and then another of the congregation speak-
ing with "tongues" and with prophetic uutterance.
buing himself was not at first entirely disposed to accept
the utterances as of divine origin. But the· undoubted
good faith and irreproachable doctrine of his flock re-
assured him. Rnbert Baxter, who was l!-bsent at the com-
mencement of the outbreak, but who was himself influenced
to prophesy at a tater date, has left an account of ltis
experiences. The phenomena did not greatly differ from
that of simil.ar outbreaks. The inspired speakers were
often attended by physical symptoms. such as convulsions,
and they spoke in loud, somewhat unnatural tones. Baxter
declares that he spoke sentences in Latin, French, and
unknown languages. At length, however, evil spirits
began to appear in the company. some of the congregation
admttting that they had been possessed by false spirits.
The outbreak seen afterwards died out.
Isaac or Holland: Very little is known about the life of this
alchemist, but he is commonly supposed to have lived and
worked early in the fifteenth century, the principal reason
for assigning his career to that period being that in his
writings he refers to Geber, Dastin. Morien and Arnold de
Villanova, but not to more moctern authorities ; while
again, he appears to have been acquainted with various
chymical processes discovered towards the close of the
fourteenth century. and hence it may reasonably be
deduced that he did not live anterior to that time. Accord-.
;ng to tradition lsa'lc worked along· with his son, whose
name is not recorded, and the pair are usuall~r regarded as
ba,'ing been the first men to exploit chymistry in the
Netherlands. They are said to have been particularly
skiJful in the manufacture of enamels and artificial gems,
and it is noteworthy that no less aistinguished an alchemist
than Paracelsus attached 'value to the Dutchmen's researches
while these are also mentioned with honour by the seven-
teenth century English scientist, Robert Boyle.
Isaac compiled two scientific treatises, the one entitled
De Trip.ici Ordine Elixiris et Lapidis Theoria, and the other
Opera Mineralia Joannis Isaaci Hollandi, sive de Lapitk
Philosophico, and both \vere published at the beginning
of the seventeenth century The more important of the
two is the last-named, wherein the author sets forth his
ideas on the exalting of.base metals into Sol and Luna, and
shows by the aid of illustrations exactly what kind of
vessels should be used for this purpose.

Italy : (For Anc1ent Italy see Rome.) Magic and sorcery
in medireval Italy seem strangely enough to have centred
round many great personalities of the church, and even
several popes have been included by the historians of occult
science in the ranks of Italian sorcerers and alchemists.
There appears to have been some sort of tradition. the origin
of which is by no means clear, that the p<)pes had been given
over to the practice of magic ever since the ~enth century,
and it was alleged that Silvester II. confessed to this
charge on lus death-bed. Levi states tnat Honorius III.,
who preached the Cr:usades, was an abominable necroman·
cer, and author of a grimoire or book by which spirits were
evoked, the use of which is reserved exclusively to the
priesthood. Platina, quoting from Martinus Polonus,
states that Silvester, who was a proficient mathematician
and versed in the J(abala on one occasion evoked Satan
himself and obtained his assistance to gain the pontifical
crow.n. Furthermore he stipulated as the price of selling
his ~oul to the Devil that he should not die except at Jerusa-
lem, to which place he inwardly determined he would never
betake himself. He duly became Pope. but on one occasion
whilst celebrating mass in a certain church at Rome. he
felt extremely ill, and suddenly remembered that he was
officiating in a chapel dedicated to the Holy Cross of Jerusa-
lem. He bad a bed set up in the chapel, to which he
summoned the cardinals, and confessed that he had held
communication with the powers of evil. He further
arranged that when dead his body should be placed upon a
car of green wood, and should be drawn by two horses, one
blackand the other white; that they should be started on
their course, but neither led nor driven, and that where
they halted there his remains should be entombed. The
conveyance stopped in front of the Lateran, and at this
juncture most terrible noises proceeded from it, wluch led
the bystanders to suppose that the soul of Silvester had
been seized upon by Satan in virtue of their agreement.
There is no doubt \vhatsoever that most of these legends
concerning papal necromancers are absolute inventions
and can be traced through Platina and Polonus to Galfridus
and Gervaise, the necromancer. whom Naude has rightly
termed " the greatest forger of fables, and the most notori-
ous liar that ever took pen in hand.! " On a par with such
stories is that of Pope Joan, who ior several years sat on
the papal throne although a "'oman, and who was supposed
Italy 231
to be one of the blackest sorceresses of all time. To her
many magic books are attributed. Levi has an interesting
passage in his llisory of Magic, in which he states that
certain engravings in a Life of this female pope, purporting
to represent her, are nothing elo;e than ancient tarots
representing Isis crowned with a tiara. " It is well-known,"
he says, " that the hieroglyphio figure on the second
tarot card is still called · The Female Pope,' being a woman
wearing a tiara, on which are the points o{ the crescent
moon, or the horns of Isis." It is much more possible that
the author of the grimoire in question was Honorius II., the
anti-pope, or perhaps ;~nother Ilonorius v:ho is described
as the son of Euclid and master of the Thebans. But all
1taliannecromancersandmagicians were by no means church-
men-indeed medireval italy was hardly a place for the
ma!Pcally inclined, ~;o stringent were the laws of the church
agamst the Black Art. Astrology, however, flourished to
some extent, and its practitioners do not appear to have
been unduly persecuted. A Florentine astrologer, named
Basil. who flourished at the beginning of the fifteenth cen-
tury, obtained some repute for successful predictions; and
is said to have foretold to Cosmo de Medici that he would
attain exalted dignity, a.~ the same planets had been in
ascendency at the hour of his birth, as in that of the Emperor
Charles V. Many remarkable predictions were made by
Antiochus Tibertus of Romagna, who was for some time
councillor to Pandolpho de Maletesta, Prince of Rimini.
He foretold to his fnend, Guido de Bogni, the celebrated
soldier, that he was unjustly ~;uspected by his best friend,
and would forfeit his life through suspicion. Of himself
he predicted that he would die on the scaffold, and of the
Prince o! Rimini, his patron, that he would die a beggar in
the hospital for the poor at Bologna. It is stated that the
prophecies came true in every detail.
Although the notices of sorcery in medireval times are
few and far betwePn in Italian history, there is reason to
suspect that although magic was not outwardly practised,
it lurked bidden in by-paths and out-of-the-way places.
We have an excellent portrait of the medireval Italian
magician in those popular myths regarding Virgil the
Enchanter. The fame of Virgil the Poet had waxed so
great in ancient Italy, that in due course of time his name
was synonymous with fame itself. From that it is a short
step to the attribution of supernatural power, and Virgil
the Roman poet became in the popular mind the medireval
Enchanter. llis myth is symptomatic of magic in medire-
val italy as a whole, and it may therefore be given here at
some length.
When the popular myth of Virgil the Enchanter first
grew into repute is uncertain, but probably the earliest
faint conception arose about the beginning of the tenth
century, and each succeeding generation embroidered
upon it some fantastic impossibility. Soon, in the South
of Italy-for the necromancer's fame was of southern
origin-there floated dim, mysterious legends of the
enchantments which be had wrought. Thus he fashioned
a brazen fly, and planted it on the gate of fair Parthenope
to free the city from the inroads of the insects of Beelzebub.
On a Neapolitan hill he built a statue of brass, and placed
in its mouth a trumpet; and lo I when the north wind blew
there came from that trumpet so terrible a roar that it
drove back into the sea the noxious blasts of Vulcan's
forges, which, even to this day, seethe and hiss near the
city of Puossola. At one of the gates of Naples he raised
two statues of stone, and gifted them respectively with the
power of blighting or blessing the strangers who, on enter-
ing the city, passed by one or the other of them. He con-
structed three public baths for the removal of every disease
which afflicts the human frame, but the physicians, in a
wholesome dread of losing their patients and their fees,
Haly
caused them to be destroyed. Other wonders he wrought_
which in time assumed a connected form, and were woven
into a life of the enchanter, first printed in French about
1490-I520. A still fuller history appearP.d in English, the
well-known " Life of Virgilius," about 1508, printed by
Hans Doesborcke at Antwerp. It set~ forth with tolerable
cleamess the popular type of the medireval magician, and
will be our guide in the following biographical sketch.
" Virgil wa.~ the son of a wealthy senator of Rome,
wealthy and powerful enough to carry on war with the
Roman Emperor. As his birth was heralded by extra-
ordinary portents, it is no marvel that even in childhood
he showed himself endowed with extraordinary mental
powers. and his father having the sagacity to discern in
him an embryo necromancer, sent him, while still very
young, to study at the University of Toledo, where the
"art of magick" was taught with extraordinary success.
" There be studied diligently, !or he was of great under-
standing, an<1 SJ?eedily acquired a profound insight into
the great Shema1a of the Chaldean lore. But this insight
was due, not so much to nocturnal vigils over abstruse
books, as to the help he received from a very vahtablc
familiar. And this was the curious fashion in which he
was introduced to the said familiar :-
,, ' Upon a tyme the scholers at Tolenten hadde lycence
to goo to playe and sporte them in the fyldes after the
usuance of the olde tymc ; and there was aL~o Virgilius
therby also walkynge among the hylles all about. It
fortuned he spyed a great hole in the syde of a great hyll,
wherein he went to depe that he culde not see no more
lyght, and than he went a lytell ferther therein, and then
be sawe soon lyght agayn&, and than wente he fourth
streyghte. And within a lytelt wyle after he harde a voice
that called, 'Virgilius, Vugilius,' and be Joked aboute,
and he colde nat soe nobodyc. Than Virgilius spake, and
asked, ' 'Who calleth me ? ' Than barde he the voyce
agayne, but he sawe nobodye. Than sayd he, 'Vlfgilius,
see ye not that lytell bourde lyinge byside you there,
marked with that worde?' Than answered Virgilius,
' I see that borde well enough.' The voyce said, ' Doo
away that bourde, and lelte me out theratte.'
" 'Than answered Virgilius to the voyce that was under
the lytell bourde, and sayd, ' \Vho art thou that talkest
me so ? • Than answered the dcvyll, • J am a devyll con-
jured out of the body of a certcyne man, and banysshed here
tyll the daye of jugemcnt, without that I be delyvered by
the handes of men. Thus, Virgilius, I pray thee delyver
me out of this payn, and I shall show unto thee many
hokes of nygromancy, and how thou shalt cum by it lytly,
and shalte knowe the practyse therein, that no man in the
science of nygromancy shall (sur)pass tbee ; and, more-
over, I shall showe and informe thee so that thou shalt
have all thy desyre, whereby methinke it is a great gyfte
for so Jytell a donygc, for ye may also thus all your poor
frendys helpen, and make rygbte your enoemyes un-
mighty.'
'' Thorough that great promise was Virgilius tempted.
He badde the fynd sbowe the bakes to hym, that he
myght have and occupy them at his wyll. And so the
iynd showed hym, and then Virgilius pulled open a bourde,
and there was a lytell hole, and thereat wrange the devyll
out lyke a yeel, and cam and stode before Virgilius lyke
a bigge mao.
" ' Thereof Virgil.ius was astonied, and merveyled
greately thereof, that so great a man myght com out at
so 1ytell a hole !
" 'Then sayd Virgilius, ' Shulde ye well passe into the
hole that ye cam out of?! 'Yes, I shall well,' sayd the
devyll. ' I bolde the beste pledge that 1 have, ye shall
not do it.' ' Well,' sayd the devyll, ' thereto I cooscnte.'
Italy 232
And then the devyll wrange hyrnself into the lytell .hole
agen, and as he was therein, Virgilius kyvered the hole agen
with the bourde close, and so wa.~ the devyll bcgyled, and
myght not there come out agen, but there abydeth shutte
styli th.
erein. Than called the devyll dredefu1ly (drearily)
to Virgilius, and sayd, 'What have ye done?' Virgilius
answered, ' Abyde there styli to your day apoynted.'
And fro thensforth abydeth he there.' "
Virgil:s father died soon after this event, and his
estates being seized by his former colleagues, his widow
sunk into extreme poverty. Virgil accordingly gathered
together the wealth he- had amassed by the exercise of his
magical skill, and set out for Rome, to replace his mother
in a position proper to her rank. At Toledo, however,
he was a famous student ; at Rome he was a despised
scholar, and \ovhen he besought the Emperor to execute
justice and restore to him his estate, that potentate--
ignorant of the magician's power-simply replied, ' Me-
thinketh that the land is well divided to them that have
it, for they may help you in their need ; what needeth
you for to care for the disheriting of one school-master
Bid him take heed, and look to his schools, for he hath no
right to any land here about the city of Rome.'
Four years passed, and only such replies as this were
vouchsafed to Virgil's frequent appeals for justice. Grow-
ing at length a-weary of the delay, he resolved to exercise
his wondrous powers in his own behalf. ·when the harvest-
time came, he accordingly shrouded the whole of his right-
ful inheritance with a vapour so dense that the new pro-
prietors were unable to approach it, and under its cover
his men gathered in the entire crop with perfect security.
This done, the mist disappeared. Then a great indignation
possessed the souls of his enemies, and they assembled their
swordsmen, and marched against him to take off his head.
Such wa.c; their power that the Emperor for fear tied out of
Rome, ' for they were twelve senators that had all the
world under them ; and if Virgilius had had right, he had
been one of the twelve, but they had disinherited him and
his mother.' \Vhen they drew near, Virgil once more
baftled their designs by encircling his patrimony with a
rampart of cloud and shadow.
The Emperor, with surprising inconsistency, now
coalesced with the senators against Virgil-whose magical
powers he probably feared far more than the rude force of
the senatorial magnates-and made war against him.
But who can prevail against the arts of necromancy ?
Emperor and senators were beaten, and from that moment
Virgil, with marvellous generosity, became the faithful
friend and powerful supporter of his sovereign......"
It may not generally be known that Virgil, besides being
the saviour of Rome, was the founder of Naples. This
feat had its origin, like so many other gTeat actions, in the
power of love.
Virgil's imagination had been fired by the reports that
reached him of the surpassing loveliness of the Sultan's
daughter. Now the Sultan lived at Babylon (that is, at
Cairo-the Babylon of the media!val romancers), and the
distance might have daunted a less ardent lover and less
potent magician. But Virgil's necromantic skill was
equal to a bridge in the air-where other glov.'ing spirits
have often raised fair castles !-and passing over it, he
found his way into the Sultan's palace,-into the Princess's
chamber,-and speedily overcoming her natural modesty.
bore her back with him to his Italian bower of pleasaunce.
There having enjoyed their :fill of love and pleasure, he
restored to her bed in her father's palace. Meanwhile, her
absence had been noted, but she was soon discovered on
her return, and the Sultan repairing to her chamber, interro-
gated her respecting her disc:.ppearance. He found tb.at
Italy
she knew not who it was tb.at had carried her off, nor
whither she had been carried.
When Virgil restored the lady on the following night,
she took back with her, by her father's instructions, some
of the fruit plucked from the enchanter's garden ; and
from its quality the Sultan guessed that she had been
carried to a southern land" on the side of France." These
nocturnal journeys being several times repeated, and the
Sultan's curiosity growing ungovernable, be persuaded
his daughter to give her lover a sleeping-draught. The
deceived magician was then captured in the Babylonian
palace. and flung into prison. and it was decreed that· both.
he and his mistress should be punished for their love by
death at the stake.
Necromancers, however, are not so easily outwitted.
As soon as Virgil was apprized of the fate intended for him,
he made, by force of his spells, the Sultan and all his lords
believe that the ~eat river of Babylon-the might Nilus-
was overflowing m the midst of them, and that they swam
and lay and sprang like geese; and so they took up Virgilins
and the Princess, tore them from their prison, and placed
them upon the aerial bridge. And when they were thus
out of danger, he delivered the Sultan from the ~ver, and
all the lords ; and lo, v.·hen they recovered their humanity,
they beheld the enchanter bearing the beautiful Princess
across the Mediterranean ; and they marvelled much, and
felt that they could not hope to prevail against' his super-
natural power.
And in this manner did Virgilius convey the Sultan's
daughter over the sea to Rome. And he ·was highly
enamoured of her beauty. " Then he thought in his mind
how he might marry her "-apparently forgetting that he
was already married-" and thought in his mind to found
in the midst of the sea a fair town with great lands belong:
ing to it ; and so he did by his cunning, and called it
Naples : and the foundation of it was of eggs. And ·in
that town of Naples .he made a tower with four corners
and on the top be set an apple upon an iron yard, and no
man could pltll away that apple without he brake it; and
through that iron set he a bottle, and on that bottle set he
an egg ; and he hanged the apple by the stalk upon a chain,
cmd so hangeth it still. And when the egg stirrcth, fO
should the town of Naples quake ; and when the egg
brake. then should the town sink. When he had made
an end, he let call it Naples."
After accomplishing so much for his. Babylonian beauty,
Virgil did not marry her, but endowing her with the town
of Naples and its lands, ga\"e her in marriage to a certain
grandee of Spain. Having thus disposed of her and her
children. the enchanter returned to Rome, collected all
his treasures, and removed them to the city he had founded,
where he resided for some years, and established a school
which speedily became of illustrious renown. Here he
lost his mfe, by whom he had had no issue ; built baths
and bridges, and wrought the most extraordinary miracles.
So passed an uncounted. number of years, and Virgil· at
length abandor.ed Naples for ever, and refired to Rome.
" Outside the walls of the Imperial City be built a.
goodly town, that had but one gate, and was so fenced
round with water as to bar any one f1om t.pproaching it.
And the entry of its one gate was made" with twenty·four
iron il.Uls, and on each side was there twelve men.smiting
v.-ith the flail~. never ceasing, the one after the other ; and
no man might come in without the flails stood still, but he
was slain. And these flajls were made with such a gin
(contriv:u1ce) th?.t Virgilius stopped them v:ben he list to
enter in thereat, but no man else could find the way.
And in this castle put Virgilius part of his trea.<;ure privily;
and, when this was done, he imagined in hi~ mind by
what means he might make himself young agai-n, becauslt

he thought to live longer many years, to do many wonders
and marvellous things. And upon a time went Virgilius
to the Emperor, and asked him of licence tof absence) by
the space of three weeks. But the Emperor in no wise
would grant it unto him for. he would have Virgilius at all
times by him."
Spirituali.sm.-\Ve have perhaps our first indication oJ
the rise and spread of spiritualism in Italy in the modem
acceptance of the term in an ;l.rticlc published in the Civitta
Catllolicn the well-known Roman organ, entitled " Modern
Necromancy." The conclusions of the article were:-
" 1st. Some of the pl.J.enomcna may be attributed to
imposture, haUudnations, and exaggerations in the reports
of those who describe it, but there is a foundation of reality
in the general sum of the reports which cannot have
originated in pure invention or be wholly discredited
without ignoring the value of universal testimony.
" 2nd. The bulk of the theories offered in explanation
of the proven facts, only cover a certain percentage of
those facts, bnt utterlv fail to account for the balance.
"3rd. Allowing for all that can be filtered aw,i!.y on mere
human hypotheses, there arc still a large class of phE-nomena
appealing to every sense which cannot be accounted for by
any kno.WIJ natural laws, and which seem to manifest the
action of intelligent beings."
D. D. Home la.~t visited the principal cities of Italy in
1852, and bad been so active in his propaganda that
numerous circles were formed after his departure. Violent
journalistic- controversies arose out of the foundation of
these socic>ties. with the result that public interest was so
aroused that it C<'uld only be satisfied with the publication
of a paper issued from Geneva, and edited by Dr Pietro
Suth and Signor B. E. :
Maniori entitled ll amore del Vero.
In ~he journal.accounts of the spiritual. movement.~ in the
vanous countries of Europe, and Amenca, were publisqed
although the Church and press levelled the anathemas
against the journal. In the spring of 1863 a society was
proved at Palermo entitled II Societa Spiritual di Palermo,
which had for president Signor J. V. Paleolozo, and for
members men of the stamp of Paolo Morelle, professor of
Latin and Philosophy.
It was about the autumn of r864 that lectures were first
given on Spiritualistic subject-; in. Italy. They were
started in Leghorn and Messina, and though of a very mixed
character, and often partaking largely of the lecturer's
peculiar idiosyncrasies on religious subjects, they served to
draw attention to the upheaval of thought going on in all
directions, in connection with the revelations from the
Spirit world. It could not be expected that a movement
s? startling an~. u~precedented as that which opened up a
direct commumcation between the natural and the Spirit
worlds could gain ground in public acceptance without
waking up all the latent clements o! enthusiasm, fanaticism,
and bigotry, which prevailed in the Italian as in every other
community.
In the yca.r 1870, there had been over a hundred different
societies formed, with varying success, in different parts of
Italy. Two of the most prominent 11ourishing at that date
yvere conducted in Na:pl~s. and according to the French
JOurnal, the Revue Sp~t'tle repr<:Sented the two opposing
schools which have prevailed in Continental Spiritualism,
namely, the" Reincarnationists" whom we have elsewhere
classified as" Spiritists" and the" Jmmortalists," or those
known in America and England merely a.<: " Spiritualists."
(See France.)
About 1868, an immense impulse was communicated to
the cause of Spiritualism-at least in the higher strata of
Italian Society-by the visit of Mr. and Mrs. Guppy to
Naples, at which place they took up their residence for two
•r three years. Mrs. Guppy-nee Miss Kichol-of J_ondon,
was renowned throughout Europe for her marvellous powers
as a" Physical force ::\fcdium" and as Mr. Guppy's wealth
and social stan<lin;{ enabled him to place bis gifted wife's
services at the command of the distinguished visitors wh<>-
crowded his salons, it soon became a matter of notoriety
that the highest magnates of the land, inclu<l.ing King
Victor Emmanuel and many of his nearest friends and
counsellors, had yielded conviction to the truth of the
astounding phenomena exhibited through Mrs. Guppy's
MediUJnship.
It was about the year 1863, that SpiritualisUI. began to
enjoy the advantage of fair and honourable repre:;entation
in the columns of a new paper entitled, the A1~nali dello
Spiritismo, or " Annals of Spiritualism." This excellent
journal was commenced at Turin, and published by Signor·
Niceforo Filalete, with all the liberality, energy, aJUi talent
worthy alike of the subject and its editor.
From the columns of the Atmali we learn that a Venetian
Society of Spiritualists, named " Atea " elected' General
Giuseppe Garibaldi their honorary president, and received
the following reply by telepraph from the distinguished
hero, the liberator of Italy : " I gratefully accept tire
presidency of the Society Atea. Caprera, 23rd September."
The same issue of the Annali contains a verbatim teport
of a" grand discourse, given at Florence, by a distinguished
literary gentleman, Signor Sebastiano Fenzi, in which .the
listeners were considerably astonished by a rehearsal of the
many illustrious names of those wbo openly avowed their
faith in Spiritualism.
The years r863- 4 appear to have been rich in Spiritualis-
tic efforts. Besides a large number of ntinor associations,
the existence of which was recorded from time to time
the early numbers of the Annali aud Revue Spirite, a
society which continued for a long time to exert a marked
influence in promoting the study of occult forces and
phenomena, was formed about this time in Florence, under
the title of The Magnetic Society of Florence. The mem-
bers of this association were without exception persons
remarkable for literary and scientific attainments, or those
of high in1luential position in society.
About this time Mr. Seymour Kirkup, a name familiar
to the early initiators of Spiritualism, resided in Florence,
and communicated many records of spiritual phenomena
to the Llmdon Spiritual Magazine. Nearly ten years after
the establishment of tho Magnetic Society of Florence,
Baron Guitern de Bozzi, an eminent occultist, founded the
Pneumatological Psychological Academy of Florence, but
upon his demise it was discontinued.
Modern Sorcery.- In his A,.adia, or the Gospel of the
Witches of Italy, the late Charles Godfrey Leland gives a
valuable account of the life and practice of the modern
Italian strega or witch. Ho says: "In most cases she
comes of a family in which her calling or art has been
practised for many generations. I have no doubt that
there al'e instances in which the ancestry remounts to
medireval, Roman, or it m;\y be Etruscan times. The
result has naturally been the accumulation in such families
of much tradition. But in Northern Italy, as its literature
indicates. though there has boon some slight gathering of
fairy tales and popular superstitions by scholars, there has
never existed the least interest as regarded the strange lore of
the witches, nor any suspicion that it embraced an incredible
quantity of old Roman minor mytbs and legends, such as
Ovid has reconled, but of which much escaped him and all
other Latin writers. .. ... Even yet there are old people in
the Romagna of the North who know the Etruscan names
of the Twelve Gods, and invocations to Bacchus. Jupiter,
and Venas, Mercury, nnd the Lares or ancestral spirits, and
in tl.J.e cities arc women who prepare strange amulets, over
which they mutter spells, all known in the old Roman time.
ltaly 234 James IV.
and who can astonish even the learned bv their legends of
Latin gods, mingled with lorewhich may be found in Cato or
Theocritus. With one of these I became intimately
acquainted in r886, and have ever since employed her
specially to collect among her sisters of the hidden spell in
many places all the traditions of the olden times known to
them. It is true that I have drawn from other sources
but this.woman by long practice has perfectly learned what
few understand, or just what I want, and how to extract
it from those of her kind.
" Among other strange relics. she succeeded, after many
yea1'1!, in obtaining the following ' Gospel.' which I have in
her handwriting A full account of its nature with many
details will be found in an Appendix. I do not know
definitely whether my informant derived a part of these
traditions from written sources or oral narration, but
believe it was chiefly the latter..... .
" For brief explanation I may say that witchcraft is
known to its votaries as la vecchia religione, or the old
religion, of which Diana is the Goddess, her daughter
Aradia (or Herodias) the female Messiah, and that this
little work sets forth bow the latter was born, came down
to earth, established witches and witchcraft, and then
returned to heaven. With it are given the ceremonies and
invocations or incantations to be addressed to Diana and
Aradia, the exorcism of Cain, and the spells of the holy-
stone, rue, and verbena, constitutins, as the text declares,
the regular church-service, so to speak, which is to be
chante4 or Dronounced at the witch-meetings. There are
also included the very curious incantations or benedictions
<>f the honey, meal. and salt, or cakes of the witch-supper,
which is curiously classical, and evidently a relic of the
Roman Mysteries."
Briefly the ritual of the Italian witches is as follows:
At the Sabbath they take meal and salt, honey and water,
and say a conjuration over these, one to the meal, one to
the salt, one to Cain, one to· Diana, the moon-goddess.
They then sit down naked to supper, men and women, and
after the feast is over they dance, sing and make love .in
the darkness, quite in the manner of the medireval Sabbath
of the sorcerers. 1\fany charms are given connected with
stones, especially if these have holes in them and are found
by accident. A lemon stuck full of pins we are told is a
good omen. Love-spells fill a large space in the little
work, which for the rest recounts several myths of Diana.
and Endymion in corrupted form. (See also Leland's
Etruscan-Roman Remains.)
Iubdan: In Ultonian romance, the King of the Wee Folk.
One day he boasted of the might of his strong man Glower,
who could hew down a thistle at one blow. His bard
Eisirt retorted that beyond the sea, there existed a race of
giants, any one of whom could annihilate a whole battalion
of the Wee Folk. Challenged to prove his words. Eisirt
brought Creda. King Fergus' dwarf and bard. He then
dared lubdan to go to Fergus' palace and taste the king's
porridge. Iubdan and Bebo, his queen, arrived at the
palace at midnight, but in trying to get at the porridge so
as to taste and be away before daybreak, lubdan fell in.
He was found in the pot next morning by the scullions,
and he and Bebo were taken before Fergus, who after a
while released them in exchange for a pair of water shoes,
wearing which a man could go over or under water as
freely as on land.
Ivunebes: Chilian familiars. (See American Indians.)
lynx : A Chaldean symbol of universal being, the name of
which signifies " power of transmission." It was repro-
duced as a living sphere or winged globe. The first example
was perhaps put forth by mind on the plane of reality, to be
followed by three others called paternal and ineffable. and
latterly by hosts of Iynxs of a subordinate character,
described as "free intelligences." The lynx is described
by Eliphas Levi as "corresponding to the Hebrew Yod
or to that unique letter from which all other Jetters were
formed."
J
Jaeintb, or Hyacinth : A stone which preserves from plague
and from lightning, strengthens the heart, and brings
wealth, honour, prudence, and wisdom. It is recommended
hy Alhertus!l!agnusas a soporific, on account of its coldness,
and is ordered by P$:ellus in cases of coughs, ruptures, and
melancholy, to be drunk in vinegar. Marbod.eus describes
the wonderful properties of three species of the jacinth ;
Pliny and Leonardus are also particular in their account
of it.
Jacob's Ladder: According to the kabalistic view, Jac:>b's
Ladder. which was disclosed to him in a vision, is a meta-
phorical representation of the powers of alr.hemy, opl'rating
through visible nature. The "Ladder" was a "Rain-
bow," or prismatic staircase, set up between heaven and
earth. Jacob's Dream implied a history of the whole
hermetic creation. There are only two original colours,
red and blue, representing "spirit" and "matter," for
<>range is red mixing with the yellow light of the sun,
yellow is the radiance of the sun itself, gTeen is blue and
yellow, indigo is blue tinctured with red. and violet is
produced by the mingling of red and blue. The sun is
alchemic gold, and the moon is alchemic silver. In the
operation of thes\': two potent spirits. or mystic rulers of
the world, it 1s suppo>led astrologically that all mundane
things were produced.
Jadhn, or Were-tiger: (See Malays.)
Jaldn and Boas : The names of the two symbolical pillars
<>f Solomon's Kabalistic temple, and which were believed
to explain all mysteries. Th!! one was black and the other
white, and they represented the powers of good and evil.
It is said that they symbolise the need of " two " in the
world : Human equilibrium requires two feet ; the worlds
gravitate by means of two forces; generation needs two
sexes.
James IV. of Scotland : It was almost inevitable that the
romantic nature of James IV. of Scotland should have
encourage-d the study of alchemy and the occult sciences in
the manner he did. Dunbar in his Remonstrallce, speaks
of the patronage which he bestowe<l. upon alchemists and
charlatans, and in the Treasurer's accounts there are
numerous payments for the " Quinta Essentia," including
wages to the persons employed, utensils of various kinds
and so forth. In a letter to one Master James Inglis,
James says:-
"James, et<'.... . to dear Master Jame<> Inglis greeting.
We graciously accept your kindness, by which in a letter
brought to us you signify that you have beside you certain
books learned in the philosophy of the true Alchemy, and
that although most worthy men have sought them from
you, you have nevertheless with difficulty kept them for
our use, because you had heard of our enthusiasm for the
art. \Ve give you thanks; ... and we have sent our·
familiar, Master James Merchenistoun, to you, that he may
see to the transfer hither of those books which you wish
us to have ; whom receive in good faith in our name.
Farewell. From our Palace at Edinburgh."

Japan : All that the word " magic" defines is to be found
amongst the Japanese, in their religious beliefs and rites
in their conception of Nature and in the national customs.
To them all forms :1.nd objects animate or inanimate possess,
equally with man, a·sou1 with good or evil tendencies, and
these entities, either of their own volition or by evocation,
come into close touch ·with man either to his advantage or
detriment. 'rheir folklore a nd traditions are wrought of
the marvellous and the Japanese thought of to-day is still
permeated with a belief in the supernatural.
Tho predominant feature of the Japanese religion,
Shintoism. is the worship o! ancestors, allied to that of
Nature. There are twelve recognised sects of Shintoism-
all with ancestor-worship as their cardinal principle. The
belief of the Japanese is that the disembodied spirits
acquire the powers of deities and possess superoatural
attributes. They become potential for good or evil and
they exercise their potentialities in the same mundane
sphere upon which their interests and affection~ centred
during life. They thus become guardian divinities, and
as such the object of ceremonies in their honour is to show
gratitude for their services whilst upon eaTth and to solicit
a cononuance of these services beyond the grave. On
this point Lafcadio Hearn wrote :-" An iutimate sense of
relation between the visible and invisible worlds is the
special religious characteristic of J apan among all civilised
countries. To Japanese thought the dead are not Jess
real than the living. They take part in th~ daily life of the
people,-sharing the humblest sorrov.'S and the humblest
JOys. They attend the family repasts, watch over the
well-being of the household, assist and rejoice in the pros-
perio/ of their descendants. They are present at the
public pageants, at all the sacred festivals of Shinto, at
the military games, and at all the entertainments especially
provided for them. And they are universally thought of
as finding pleasure in the offerings made to them or the
honours conferred upon them." Every morning, before
the family shrine, to be found in all Japanese homes,
flowers are set and food-emblems placed as offerings of
pious affection, while ancient prayers are repeated, for on
the shrine, beside the symbols of the Sun-goddess and the
tutelary god of the family are put the memorial tablets
~ootaining names, ages and dates of death of members of
the household. There are stories of the souls of ancestors
taking material form and remaining vi.'lible through cen-
turies. In the month of J uly three days are set apart for
the celebration of the Festiual of the Dead. At this time
it is thought that the disembodied souls return from the
dismal region of the Shades to gne for a while upon the
beauty of their country and to visit their people. On the
first morning new mats are placed upon all altars and on
every household shrine, while in aU the homes tiny meals
are prepared in readiness for the ghostly guests. The
streets at night are brilliant with many torches; in front
of every house gaily-coloured lanternS' are lit in welcome.
Japan
Those who have recently lost some relative go to the
cemeteries to pray and burn incense and leave offerings of
water and flowers set in bamboo vases. On the third day
the souls of those who are undergoing penance are fed, also
those who have no friends among the living to care for
them. The evening of this day is the time of the ghosts'
departure, and for this thousands of little boats are fashioned
and laden with food-offerings and tender messages of fare-
well. When the night falls, tiny lanterns are lit and hung
at the miniature prows and the ghosts are supposed to step
aboard. Then the craft are set free upon river, lake and
sea, the water gleaming with glow of thousands of lights.
On this day no saiior dreams of putting out to sea-for
this one night it belongs to the dead. It is believed that if
a ship faHs to come to port before the sailing ot the ghost-
fleet the dead arise from the deep and the sailors can hear
their mournful whispering, while the white breakers are
their hands clutching the shores, vainly trying to return.
In the Shinto pantheon there are deities representing
well nigh everything in heaven and earth; from the moun-
tain of Fiyiyama to the household kitchen, from Wisdom to
Sca.recrows, from Caligraphy to Poverty, Laughter to
Sinall pox. When babes are a week old they are taken to
the temple and placed under the protection of some god
chosen by the parents, but in later years he may choose his
patron god for himself beside the tutelary one.
In remote parts of Japan may still be found traces of an
older form of Shinto in which phallic symbols bad their
place as representing life-giving power and therefore used
as a magical exorcism of evil influences, especially that of
disease. In this connection appears a dwarf-god who is
said to have first taught mankind the art of magic and
medicine In Shinto there are no idols, their place being
taken by shintia, god-bodies, concrete objects m wllich
the divine spirit is supposed to dwell, such as the mirror,
jewel and sword of the Sun-goddess, worshipped at the
famous Ise shrine. Pilgrims from all parts of Japan make
their way to this shrine, acquiring merit and purification
thereby. These pilgrims receive from the priests objects
of talismanic properties called hal'ai, these also serving as
evidence of having been at the holy place. In former days
they were recognised as passports. The term hal'ai signifies
to "drive out," to "sweep away," and has reference to
the purification of the individual from his sins. These
objects are in the form of small envelopes or paper boxes
each containing shavings of the wands used by the Ise
priests at the half-yearly festivals held to purify the nation
in general from the consequences of the sins of the preceding
six months. The list includes witchcraft, also wounding
and homicide, these latter being regarded more a' unclean-
ness than as a moral stigma. On the pilgrims return home
the harai are placed upon the "god's-shelf."
On fete-days are still practised the ancient ol'deals.
These are three in number, the Kugadachi, in which priests,
wrought to ecstatic frenzy by particiP.ation in a rhythmic
dance, pour upon their bodies boiling water without
receiving harm from the process; the Hiwatari consisting
o£ walking barefoot over a bed of live coals, priests and
people alike participating, and Tsurugi-watari, the climbing
of a ladder of sword-blades. These are regarded as tests
of purity of character, this being thought to confer an
immunity from hurt in these ordeals. The attendant
rites consist of exorcism of evil spirits by the waving of
wands and magical finger-knots, and invocation of the
gods who are then believed to be actually present.
Possession by Diuinilies.-ln connection with some of the
Shinto sects occult rites are practised to bring about posses-
sion of a selected person by the actual spirits of the gods.
Priests and laymen alike develop and practice this art,
undergoing a period of purification by means of various
Japan 236
austerities. Prophecy, divination and the cure of disease
are the objects of these rites. The ceremony may take
place in a temple or ordinary house where the '' gods'
shelf" makes the shrine. In the rites gohei, the Shinto
symbols of consecration are used, the pendant form for
purification and exorcism of evil inftuenccs, and an upright
gohei af!i:l!ed to a wand signifying the shintai, or god-body,
is the central object. The medium, called nak aza takes
his seat in the midst. Next him in importance is the
functionary, the maeza who presides over the ceremony.
It is he who builds the magical PYTC in a brass bowl and
burns in the ftames strips of paper inscribed with characters,
effigies of disease and trouble. There is a clapping of
bands to call the attention of the gods and chants are
intoned, accompanied by the shaking of metal-ringed
crosiers and the tinkle of pilgrim bells. After the fire is
burnt out, the bowl is removed and she.ets of paper placed
in symbolic form, upon which is then put the upright
gohei wand. There is further chanting, the medium closes
his eyes and clasps his hands into which the maeza now
thrusts the wand. All then await the advent of the god
which is indicated by the violent shaking of the >'7and and
convulsive throes on the part of the medium, who is now
considered to have become the god. The maeza reverently
prostrates himself before the entranced '<lakaza, and asks
the name of the god who has deigned to come. This done
and answered, he next offers his petitions, to which the god
replies. The ceremony is concluded by a prayer and the
medium is awakened by beating upon his back and the
massaging of his limbs out of their cataleptic contraction.
These possession-rites are also conducted by the pilgrims
who ascend the mountain of Ontake.
Buddhism, which shares with Shinto the devotions of
Japan, enjoins meditation as a means of attaining to
supernatural knowledge and occult power. Itis said that
to those who in truth and constancy put in force the
doctrines of Buddha the following ten powers will be
granted. (1) . They know the thoughts of others. (2).
Their sight, piercing as that of the cclestials, beholds
without mist all that happens in the earth. (3). They know
the past and present. (4). They perceive the uninterrupted
succession of the ages of the world. (5). Their hearing is
so fine that they perceive and can interpret all the bar-
monies of the ·three worlds and the ten divisions of the
universe. (6). They are not subject to bodily conditions
and can assume any appearance at will. (7). They dis-
tinguish the shadowing of lucky or unlucky words, whether
they are near or far away. {8). They possess the knowledge
of all forms, and kno·wing that form is void, they can
assume every sort of form ; and knowing that vacancy is
form. they can annihilate and render nought all forms.
(9). They possess a knowledge of all laws. (ro). They
possess the perfect science of contemplation. It is said
that methods arc thus known by which it is possible to so
radically change the psychological condition of the individ-
ual that he is enabled to recognise the character of the
opposition between subjective and objective. These two
extremes are reconciled in a higher condition of conscious-
ness, a higher form of life, a more profound and complete
activity which concerns the inmost depths of the self. To
the ·· Zen " monasteries, belonging to a Buddhist sect of
that name, anyone who is so inclined may retire for tem-
porary meditation and for the development of these special
faculties, which are mainly produced by entering upon a
calm mental state, not exactly passive, but in which the
attention is not devoted to any one thing, but is evenly
distributed in all directions, producing a sort of vo:d and
" waiting." The spirit thus obtains entire repose and a
3atisfaction of the thirst for the ideal. This mystical
retirement is sought by statesmen and generals, by SCientific
Japan
professional and business-men, and it is said that the force
which accumulates within them by practising the " Zen "
methods is of effective service to them in practical life.
Many of the customs of the Japanese have a magical
significance. At the Festival of the New Year extending
over three days it is considered of the first importance to
insure good luck and happiness for the coming year by
means of many traditional observances. Houses arc
thoroughly cleansed materially and sr:iritually, this last il>
getting rid of the evil spirits by throwing out beans and peas
from the open slides of the houses. The gateways are
decorated with straw ropes made to represent the lucky,
Chinese numbers of three, five and seven. Mirror cakes,
associated with the sun-goddess are eaten, also lobsters,
longevity being symbolised by their bent and ancient,
appearance, the pine-tree branches used for decoration at
this time also signifying long life.
Divination is performed by various methods: by divining
rods, by the reading of lines and cracks in the shoulder-
blade of a deer, and by the classical form taken from the
Confucian " Yih-king " or Book of Changes, this involving
the use of eight trigrams and sixty-four diagrams. One
method of" raising spirits" used by the Japanese. especially
by girls who have lost their lovers by death, is to put into a
paper lantern a hundred rushlights and repeat an incanta-
tion of a hundred lines. One of these rushlights is taken
out at the end of each line and the would-be ghost-seer then
goes out in the dark with one light still burning and blo·ws
it out when the ghost ought to appear.
Charms are everywhere, fashioned of all substances and
in all forms, such as strips of paper bearing magical in-
scriptions to avert evil, fragments of temples, carven rice-
grains representing the gods of Luck, sutras to frighten the
demons, copies of Buddha's footprint, and paper tickets
bearing the name of a god are often affixed outside the
doors of houses to combat the god of Poverty.
Nature and her manifestations arc the result of indwelling
soul-life and the Japanese mind, imbued with this belief
bas peopled nature with multiform shapes. There are
dragons vo;ith lairs in ocean and river which yet can fiy
abroad in the air while from their panting breath come the
clouds of rain and tempests of lightning. In the mountains
and forests are bird-like gnomes who often beset way-faring
men and women and steal away their wits. There are also
mountain men, huge hairy monkeys, who help the wood-
cutters in return for food, and mountain-women, ogres with ·
bodies grown over with long white hair, who flit like evil
moths in search of human flesh. Then legend tells of the
Senrim, hermits of the mountains, who knew all the secrets
of magic, wizards who were attended by wise toads and
flying tortoises, who could conjure magical animals out
of gourds, who could project their souls into space. To
anim'l.ls were also ascribed supernatural powers. The fox
is believed to possess such gifts to an almost limitless extent,
for he has miraculous vision and hearing, be can read the
inmost thoughts of man, he can transform himself and
assume any shape at will. He loves to delude mankind and
work destruction thereby to this end often taking the
form of a beautiful and seductive woman whose embrace
means madness and death. To the agency of this animal
is attributed demoniacal possession, th:s occurring mostly
among ignorant and superstitious 'Nomen of the lower
classes. The cat is not regarded with any kindly feeling
by the Japanese, this being ascribed to the fact that thi&
animal, togetlter with the serpent, were the only creature:.
who did not weep at Buddha's death. This animal has ·
abo the power of bewitchment ;ond possesses vampire
proclivities. Among s11ilors, hmvever, the cat is held in
estimation, for it is thought to possess the power of warding
off the evil spirits wwch haunt tile sea. The images of
Jasper 237 Jeanne D'Are
animals are thought to be also endowed with life. There Jean d'Arras : A French writer of the fourteenth century, who

.Kabala, 'The : A Hebrew and Jewish system of theosophy.
The word signifie!l •· doctrines. received from tradition." In
:tncient Hebrew literature the name was used to denote the
entire body of religious writin~es. the Pentateuch excepted.
It is only in the early middle ages that the system of
theosophy known as Kaballsm was designated by that
name. We will first consider the J(abata as a literary
production before proceeding to examine it in the light of
a hand-book of Hebrew occultism. The main sources
which went to the makin~ of the Kabala are the SepheY
Yesirah or Book of Creation, which is a combination of
medireval mysticism and science. The date of origin of this
wo.rk has been mattt>r of great argument, but. it is perhaps
safest to say that it seems to be earlier than the ninth
century A.D. Tbe Bahir or brilliant is first quoted by
Nahmanides, and is usually attributed to his teacher, Ezra.
It o"es much to the Sepher Y esirah, and to a great extent
foreshadows the Zohar, which is a commentary on the
Pentaieucll, including eleven dissertations on that book.-
the most important of which are the Book of Secrrts, the
Secret of Secrets, the Mysteries of tlte Pentate11rh, and the
Htdiktz Interpretation. It pretends to the authorship of
Simon ben Yohai in the second century, and it is alleged
that he drew his sources from traditional dialogues between
God and Adam in Paradise. It is further stated that it was
discovered in a cavern in Galilee where it had been hidden
for one thousand years. It h:~s been proved almost beyond
doubt, however, that it was written in the t-hirteenth
century, and the capture of Jerusalem by the Crusaders is
alluded to. It is also believed that Moses de Leon, who
died in 35, and who circulated and sold the Zohar. was
himself its author. At the same time there is no doubt
that it enshrines a Iarse number of very ancient and im-
portant Hebrew traditions. The matter contained in the
Kabala deals with the nature of God. the sephiroth or
divine emanations, of angels and of man. God, known in
the Kabala as En Soph, fills and contains the universe. As
he is boundless, mind cannot conceive him, so in a certain
mystical sense he is non-existent. The doctrine of the
sephiroth is undoubtedly the most important to be met:
with in the pages of the Kabala. To justify his existence
the Deity had to become active and creative, and this he
achieved through the medium of the ten sephiroth or
intelligences which emanated from him like rays pro-
ceeding from a luminary. The first sephiroth or emanation
was the wish to become manifest, and this contained nine
other inteliigences or sephiroth, which again emanate one
from the other-the second from the first, the third !rom the
second, and so forth. These are known as the Crown,
Wisdom.. Intelligence, Love, Justice, Beauty, Firmness,
Splendour, Foundation and Kingdom. From the junction
of pairs of sephiroth. other emanations were formed : thus
from \Visdom and Intelligence proceeded Love or Mercy
and from Mercy and Justice, Beauty. The sephiroth are
also symbolical of primordial man and the heavenly man,
of which earthly man is the shadow. They form three
triads which respectively represent intellectual, moral, and
physical qualities : the first, Wisdom, Intelligence and
Crown ; the second Love, Justice and Beauty ; the third
Firmness, Splendour and Foundation. The whole is
Xabala 241
Circled or bound by Kingdom, the ninth sephiroth. Each
of these triads symbolises a portion of the human frame :
the first the head ; the second the arms ; the third the legs.
Jt must be understOod that though those sephiroth are
emanations from God they remain a portion, and simply
represent different aspects of the One Being.
Kabatistic cosmology posits four different worlds, ~ach
-of which forms a sephiric system o~ a decade of emanations,
which were verified in the following manner : the world of
emanations or the heavenly man, a direct emanation from
the En Sop~. From it is produced the world of cr~!lon,
-or the Briallc world of pure nature, but yet not so spmtual
as the first. The angel Metatron inhabits itand constitutes
the world of pure spirit. He governs the visible world and
guides the revolutions of the planets. From this is formed
the world of formation or the Yetzi,aJiG world, still less
refined, which is the abode of angels. Finally from these
emanates the world of action· or matter, the dwelling of
evil spirits, which contains ten hells, each becoming lower
until the depths of diabolical degradation is reached. The
prince of this region is Samael, the evil spirit, the serpent of
Genesis, otherwise " the Beast." But the universe was
incomplete without the creation of man ; the heavenly
Adam, that is the tenth sephiroth, created the earthly

soul, cruder soul or tzeptesh. Each soul, before its entrance
into the world consists of male and female united into one
being, but when it descends to this earth, the two parts
are separated and animate difierent bodies. The destiny
of the soul upon earth is to develop the perfect germs
imJ>Ianted in it, which must ultimately return to En Soph.
If 1t does not succeed in acquiring the experience for which
it has been sent to earth, it must re-inhabit the body three
times till it becomes duly purified. When all the souls in
the world of the sephiYoth shall have passed through this
period of probation and returned to the bosom of. En
Soph, the jubilee will commence; even Satan will be
restored to his angelic nature, and existence will be a
Sabbath without end. The Kabala states that these
esoteric doctrines are contained in the Hebrew scriptures,
but cannot 'be perceived by the uninitiated; they are,
however, plainly revealed to persons of spiritual mind.
Next considering the KabaJa as occult literature, we
find it stated that the philosophical doctrines developed in
its pages are found to have been perpetuated by the secret
method of oral tradition from the first ages of humanity.
" The Kabala," says Dr. Ginsburg, when explaining the
story of its birth, " was first taught by God Him.«elf to a
select company of angels, who formed a thcosophic school in
Paradise. After the Fall the angels most ?Taciously
communicated this heavenly doctrine to the diSobedient
child of earth. to furnish the protoplasts with the means
of returning to their pristine nobility and felicity. From
Adam it passed over to Noah, and then to Abraham, the
friend of God, who emigrated with it to Emt. where the
patriarch allowed a portion of this mystenous doctrine to
ooze out. It was in this way that the Egyptians obtained
some knowledge of it, and the other Eastern nations could
introduce it into their philosophical systems. :\!oscs, who
was learned in all the wisdom of Egypt, was first initiated
into the Kabala in the land of his birth, but became most
proficient in it during his wanderings in the wilderness,
when he not only devoted to it the leisure hours of the
Kabala
whole forty years, but received lessons in it from one of the
angels. By the aid of this mysterious science the law-
giver was enabled t:o solve the difficulties which arose
during his management of the Israelites, in spite of the
pilgrimages, wars, and frequent miseries of the nation. He
covertly laid down the principles of this secret doctrine
in tlie first four books of the Pentateuch, but withheld
them from Deuteronomy. Moses also initiated the seventy
Elders into the secrets of this doctrine, and they again
transmitted them from hand to hand. Of all who formed
the unbroken line of tradition, David and Solomon were
the most deeply initiated into the I<abala. No one, bow-
ever, dared to write it down till Schimeon ben Jochai, who
lived at the time of the destruction of the second. After
his death, his son, Rabbi Eleazar, and his secretary, Rabbi
Abba, as well as his disciples, collated Rabbi Simon Ben
Jochai's treatises, and out of these composed the celebrated
work called Z H R, Zohar, Splendour, which is the grand
storehouse of Kabalism."
The history of Kabalistic origins, however, is as has been
shown almost wholly fabulous, and no evidence worthy of
the name can be adduced in its support. The mysticism of
the Mislma and the Talmud must be carefully distinguished
from that of the Kabalistic writin&s, as they are un-
doubtedly of very considerable antiqu1ty. But the Kabala
has certain claims upon the modern student of mysticism.
Its philosophical value is not depreciated by its modern
origin, and it is regarded by many as an absolute guide to
knowl~e in all the most profound problems of existence.
Its theSis is extensive and profound, but examination
unfortunately proves it to be merely a series of dogmatic
hypotheses, a body of positive doctrine based on a central
assumption which is incapable of proof. This tradition,
says Eliphas Levi, wholly reposes on the single dogma of
magic, that the Visible is for us a proportional measure of
the Invisible. In fact it proceeds by analogy from the
known to the unknown. At the same time, it is a most
interesting effort of the human mind.
Medireval magic was deeply indebted to Kaba.listic
combinations of the divine names for the terms of its
rituals, and from it it derived the belief in a resident
virtue in sacred names and numbers. Certain definite
rules are employed to discover the sublime source of power
resident in the Jewish scriptures. Thus the words of
several verses in the scriptures which arc regarded as
containing an occult sense, are placed over each other, and
the letter'3 arc formed into new words by reading them
vertically ; or the words of the text are arranged in squares
in such a manner as to be read vertically or otherwise.
Words are joined together and re-divided, and the initial
and final letters of certain words are formed into separate
words. Again, every letter of the word is reduced to its
numerical value, and the word is explained by another of
the same quantity. Every letter of a word too is taken to
be an initial of an abbreviation of it. The twenty-two
letters of the alphabet are divided into two halves, one
half is placed above the other, and the two letters which
thus become associated are interchanged. This a becomes
l, b, m, and so on. This cipher alphabet is c.~lled albm
from tlic first interchanged pairs. The commutation of
the twenty-two letters is effected by the last letter of the
alphabet taking the place of the first, the last but one the
place of the second and so forth. This cipher is called
atbah. These permut3.tions and combinations arc much
older than the Kabala, and obtained amongst jewish
occultists from time immemorial.
Lastly, it should be pointed out that the Kabala has
been condemned nowhere more strongly than among the
Jews themselves. Jewish orthodoxy has always been
suspicious of it, and as Mr. A. E. Waite has well said :
Kabot~rmannekens 24:2 Keingala
" The best lesson we can learn from it is the necessity of
scrupulously separating the experimental knowledge of the
mystics from their bizarre.fields of speculation."
Kabotermannekens : According to the Flemish peasants,
little spirits which play tricks on the women of the country,
particularly on those who work in the dairy.
Kaf : According to the ;:\Iusulmans, a great mountain that
stretches to the horizon on every side. The earth is in the
middle of this mountain, they say, like a finger in the middle
of a ring. Its foundation IS the stone SakhraJ, the least
fragment of which is capable of working untold marvels.
This stone it is which causes earthquakes. It is made of a
sin~le emerald. The mountain, ,1/hicb is frequently spoken
of 10 Eastern tales, is said to be the habitation of genii.
To reach it one must pass through dark wildernesses, and
it is essential that the traveller be guided by a supernatural
being.
Kai : The seneschal of King Arthur, known in the French
romances as Messire Queux, or Maitre Queux or Kuex. He
is prominent in the Morte d'Arthur. In the tale of Kilhwuh
and Olwen in the Mabinogion, he is identified with a per·
sonage whose " breath lasted nine nights and days under
water '' and who " could exist nine. nights and nine days
without sleep." A wound from his sword could not be
cured ; he could make himself as tall as the highest tree,
and so great was the heat of his nature that, during rain,
whatever he carried rcmaint!d dry. Originally a deity, a
rain-and-thunder god, he had apparently degenerated,
through a series of mythological processes, into a mere hero.
Kale Thaungto : A town of wizards in Lower Burma. (See
Burma.}
Kalid : (See Morlen.)
Kapila : believed by the Hindus to be the god Vishnu, son of
Brahman, in the fifth of his twenty-four incarnations. He
\rrote a series of phJiosophical propositions known as the
S.ttras, in which he states it is by philosophical study alone
that one may attain union with the deity.
Kardec, Allen : The 11011~ de grterre of Denizard Rivail. the
French spiritualist whose doctrines were largely accepted
on the Continent and especially in France. The chief tenet
in spiritism was the doctrine of re-incarnation. Rivail,
before his conversion to spiritualism, had occupied himself
a great deal with animal magnetism. In 1856 he was intro·
duced into a spiritualistic circle by Victorien Sardou. His
Livre des Esprits and the works with which he followed it
were based largely on communications received through
mediums. They had a wide circulation, and the doctrines
of spiritism became much more popular, in France at
least, than those of the rival spiritualism. which did not
include re-incarnation among its tenets. The na.mcs Alla11
and Karder; which M. Rivail assumed were names he had
borne in two former incarnations, revealed to him by
mediumistic communications. He was the editor of La
Revue Spirite, and the founder and president of the Pari<:ian
Society for Spiritualistic Studies, at which M. Camille
Fla.mm:~rion, then nineteen years of age, made his first
acquaintance with psychic science in 1861. Alla" Kardec
died in 1869, his doctrin'es having by tbat time become
firmly established. In Dritain, however, they made but
little headway, his only disciple of note in this country
being Miss Anna Blackwell. (See France and Spiritualism.}
Karma is a doctrine common to Brahmanism, Buddhism and
Theosophy though theosophists have not adopted it wholly
as it is taught in the two religions mentioned. The word
karma itself means "action," but it may be useful to
remember that generally the doctrine teaches that every·
thing done is done for eternity, that, in short, "thou shalt
reap as thou didst sow." Action is not homogeneous but
on the contrary, contains three elements, the thought which
conceives it, the will which finds the means of accomplish·
ment, and the union of thought and will which brings the
action to pass. It is plain, therefore, that thought is very
potent for good or evil, for as the thought is, so v.ill the
action be. The miser, thinking of avarice, is avaricious,
the libertine, thinking of vice, is vicious, and on the con-
trary, those of virtuous thoughts show virtue in their
actions. Arising naturally from such teaching is the
attention devoted to thought-power. Taking the analogy
of the physical body which may be developed by regimen
and trairung, based on natural scientific laws, theosophists.
teach that character may, in exactly the same way, be
scientifically built up. Physieal weakness can be eradi·
cated and an opposite state of affairs brought about by
special exercise of the weak part, and by a similar method,
weakness of character may be converted into strength
Every vice is considered to evidence the Jack of a corres·
pondmg "irtue, avarice for instance showing the absence of
generosity. Instead, however, of allowing matters to rest
at this, under the plea-arising from ignorance-that the
man was naturally avaricious, theosophists, on the lines of
scientific knowledge, teach that constant thought directed
to generosity will in time change the man's nature in this
respect. This result cannot, of course, be brought about
in a day, and the length of time necessary depends on at
least t wo f::Lctors, the strength of thought and the strergth
of the vice, for the latter may be the sum of the indulgence
of many a~cs and hence corrc:;pondinglydifficult to eradicate
The doctri'ne of karma must, however, be considered not in
its relation to one life only, but in the light of the theo·
sophie teaching of re-incarnation (q.v.). Re-incarnation is
carried on under the law of karma as well as of evolution.
The new-born man bears within him the seeds of what he for-
merly was. His character is the same as it was. It is as he
made it in past existences and accordingly as be made it,
~o does it continue unless he himself change it as he had the
power to do. Eachsucceeding existence finds that character
more definite in one direction or another.and if it be c'vil,
the effort to change it becomes increasingly difficnlt, indeed
a complete change may not be possible until many exist-
ences of effort have passed. In such cases as these, the
promptings of evil may be too strong to be resisted, yet the
man who has an intelligent Jrnowledge of the workings of
Karma, though be must eventually yield, does so only
after the most desperate struggle of which his nature is
capable, and th\IS, 1nstcad of yielding weakly and increa.s·
ing the power of the evil, he has helped to destroy its
potency. Only in the most rare cases can he free himself
with one effort. (See also Theosophy and Evolution.)
Katean Secret Society : A secret society of the Moluccas.
Anyone who wished to become a member was introduced
into the Kaiean house through an aperture in the form of
a crocodile's jaws or a cassowary's beak. Having remained
there for a few days he was secretly remove<l to a remote
spot. At the end of two months he was permitted to
re1;urn to his relatives- hitherto unaware of his where·
abouts-a member of the Katea11 Society.
Katbari : An heretical sect who excited the wrath of the
clergy in medi;eval times. (See Waldenses.}
Katie King : A spirit. (See l\laterlalisatlon and Spiritualism.)
Katika Lima: i\lala.y system of Astrology. (See Malays.}
Katika Tujo :Malay system of Astrology. (See Itlalays.}
Kauks, hatched from cock's egg : (See Coek.)
Keingala : The weathcnvisc mare of Asmund in the saga of
Grettir the Strong. Her roz.ster belie,·cd in her weather
prophecies, and, in setting his second son, Grettir, to look
after the horses. told him to be guided by Kei11gala, who
would always return to the stable before a storm. As she
persisted in remaining on the cold hillside, grazing on the
scanty grass till the lad was nearly frozen with cold, Grettir
determined to make her return home regardless of_;_the
K elly 243 Kiss
weather. One moming before turning out the horses he
tore off a long strip of her skin from wither to flank. This
bad the effect of making the marc soon seck her stable ;
and the same thing occurring the next day, no storm
impending, Asmund himself let out the horses, when he
discovered what had been done.
Reily, Edwl\rd : (See Dee.)
Heiple, The : A water spirit which, in Scotland, is believed
to haunt streams and torrents. Kelpies appear to be of a
mischievous nature, and were often accused of stopping
the water-wheels of mills, and of swelling streams. Tbe
I<elpie is occasionally used as a name of terror to frighten
unruly children ; and it was believed that he also devoured
women.
Kepbalonomancy : A method of divination which ;_
s practised
by making divers signs on the baked head of an ass. It
was familiar to the Germans and tbe Lombards substituted
for it the head of a goat. The ancients placed lighted
carbon on an ass's head, and pronounce<! the names of those
who were snspcctcd of any crime. If a crackling coincided
with the utterance of a name, the latter was taken as
being that of the guilty person.
Kephu : a Karen Vampire. (See Vampire.)
Kepler, J ohn-IS7I-I6JO: A great mathematician and
astrologer. He was born at \Veil in \Vortemburg and
educated at a monastic school at Maulbrunn and after-
wards at the university of TUbingcn, where he studied
philosophy, mathematics, theology and astronomy. In
1593 he became p1ofcssor of mathematics and morals at
Gratz in Styria, where he also continued his astrological
studies. He had an unhappy home life, and was some-
what persecuted for his doctrines. In 1626 were printed
the famous Rodolphine tables, which he had prepared
along with Tycho de Brahe, the astronomer. He died at
Ratisbon. The laws of the courses of the planets, deduced
by Kepler from observations made by Tycho, and known
as TM Three Laws of Kepler, became the foundation of
~ewton's discoveries, as wcU as the whole modern theory
of the plane~. His services in the cause of astronomy
have placed him high amongst the distinguished men of
!.cience, anti in x8o8 a monument was erected to his memory
at Ratisbon. His most important work is his Astro11omia
nova, sea Physic(! Cotleslis tradita Commentariis de .Motibus
Stellae Martis (16<>9) wh;ch is still regarded as a classic by
astronomers.
Kerheb : Egyptian Scribes. (See Egypt.)
Kerner, Dr. : (See Spiritualism.)
Kether : The I<abbalistic name for the number one, and
meaning " Reason "-the Crown, the equilibrating power.
Also a Hebrew occult name for one of the three essentials
of God-Reason.
Kevan of the Curling Locl<s : The lover o! Clcena who went
off to hunt in the woods, leaving her to be abducted by the
fairies.
Key of Solomon the King : A magical treatise of medi::eval
origin, of which a number of manuscripts are extant. It
is supposed to be the work of King Solomon (q.v.), but is
manifestly of comparatively modern origin, and was
probably writlen in the fourteenth or· ti!tccnth century.
It is permeated with late Jewish ideas, and its chief inten-
tion appears to be the finding of treasure, and the making
of such experiments as have for their object t he interference
-..-ith the free \\ill of others. The power of the Divine
Name is much in evidence, and the entire work Is an
absurd combination of pomposity and nonsense.
The LemtgBiou, or Leeser Key of Solomon, is much more
noteworthy.. Its earliest examples date from the seven-
teenth century, and it invokes the hierarchies of the abyss
by legions and millions. It is divided- into four parts,
which control the offices of all spirits at the will of the
operator. The first part, G~tia, contains forms of con-
juration for seventy-two demons with an account of t heir
powers and offices. The second part. Theurgia Gi'etia,
deals with the spirits of the cardinal points, who arc of
mixed nature. The third book is called the Pauline Art-
the significance of wh:ch name is unaccountable. It deals
with the angels of the hours of the day and night, and of the
signs of the Zodiac. The fourth part is entitled Almadel,
which enumerates four other choU'S of spirits. Tbe usual
homilies regarding purity of life arc insisted upon, as is the
circumstance that none of the conjurations shall be applied
to the injury of another.
Khaib : The Egyptian name for the shadow, which at de~th
was supposed to quit the body to continue a separate exist-
ence of its own. It was represented undt!r the form of a
sunshade.
Khu : The Egyptian name for one of the immortal parts of
man, probably the spirit. The word means " clear" or
" luminous" and is symbolised by a flame of fire.
Khwaja Ka Mulay : (See Siberia.)
Kian : In Irish legend, F~ther of Lugh. llis magical cow
with her wonderful supply of milk having been stolen by
Ba.lor, he revenged himself by making llalor's daughter,
Ethlinn. the mother of three sons. Of these two were
drowned by Balor, and the third Lugh, escaping by falljng
into a bay, was wafted back to his father, ]{ia11. Some
years later, while fighting in Ulster, ](ian feU in with the
three sons of Turenn whose hm1se was at enmity with bim.
To escape their notice, he turned himself into a pig, but
they recognised him and he was wounded by one of them.
He begged to be restored to his human shape before dying.
This being granted, he rejoiced in having outwitted his
enemies, as they would now have to pay the blood-fine for
a man instead of a pig. The brothers, determined that
there should be no blood-stained weapon to publish tbe
deed, stoned Kia11 and buried his body.
King Robert of Sicily : (En~lish romance of the fourteenth
century, author unknown). It has never been printed.
It tells how J(ing Robert of Sicily was beguiled by pride
into sneering at a priest who read mass. To punish him,
an angel was sent down by God, and he, assuming Robert's
shape, transformed the Kir.g into the likeness of his own
fool : he is sent out to lie with the dogs. He was at length
allowed to resume his proper shape alter a long and igno-
minious penance. Sec poem on the subject by Longfellow.
Kinocetus : A stone said to be good in casting out devils.
Kirk, Robert : (See Scotland.)
Kisebuph : In the I<abala, the higher magical influence. It
is divided into two branches, an elementary and a spiritual,
and includes exorcism. Sometimes I<ischuph exhibits a
striking resemblance to the witchcraft of medi::eval times.
Sorcerers were said to change themselves into animals, and
~o long distances in a very short time. They may also
mduce pain and disease and death in men and animals .
St ill further allied to witches are the " women who make
a contract with the Schedim, and meet them at certain
times, dance with them, and visit these spirits who appear
to ' them in the shape of goats. In many countries such
women arc killed." This form of I<ischuph is true sorcery;
the othe1 form, material Kischuph. is rather evil sympathy,
consisting of disturbing influences on the natural elements
produced by exciting false "rapports" in various sub-
stances.
Kiss, Bewitched by means of a : Florence Newton, a notorious
witch of the :
Middle Ages, was on several occasions accused
of having bewitched people by means of a kiss. The first
was a servant-maid who had refused alms to her. About
a week later the witch kissed her violently, from which
time she suffered from fits and was transported from place
to place, now being carried mysteriously to the top of the
Klinnrath 244 Lady of Lawers
house, now being placed between two feather beds, and so
on. The witch also caused the death of one David Jones,
who stood sentinel over her in prison, by kissing ·his hand,
and by the same means brought about the death of the
children of three Youghal aldermen.
Ktlnnrath, Henry : A German alchemist and hierophant of
the physical side of the }1-1agnum Opus. He was certainly
aware of the greater issues of Hermetic theorems and may
be regarded as a follower of Paracelsus. He was born in
Saxony about the year 1560. Af the age of z8 he graduated
in medicine at the University of Basle. He practised in
Hamburg and thereafter in Dresden where he died in
poverty and obscurity in r6ot, at the age of forty-five.
The most remarkable of his works, some of which are still
in Manuscript, is the Anphithealrum Sapientia~ lEterna1
so/ius vera~, Christiano Kabbalislicwn divino magicum, &c.
It is an unfinished work and appeared after his decease
with a pl"eface and conclusion by Erasmus Wohlfahrt. It
is a purely mystical and magical treatise. The seven steps
leading to the goal of universal knowledge are described in
a commentary on the Wisdom of Solomon. The work has
been described as being the voice of ancient chaos, and its
curious folding plates are particularly suggestive.
Klinschor, or Klingsor : Lord of the 1\'lagic Castle wherein are
kept Arthur's mother and other queens. He is nephew to
Virgilius of Naples and is overcome by Gawain. He is
alluded to in the Parsiva/ of ·wolfram von Esci1enbach.
Knigge : (See Illuminati.)
Knox, John : (See Scotland.)
Koilon is the name applied to the ether by Mrs. Besant and
Mr. C. W. Leadbeater in their book on Occult Chemistry.
(See Ether, Theosophy.)
Kommasso : Evil spirits inhabiting trees. (See Burma.)
Koons' Spirit Room : A lo; seance-room erected in Dover,
Athens County, Ohio, by a farmer, Jonathan Koons, in
1852. Koons, an early convert to spiritualism, had been
told that he and his eight children would develop medium-
istic powers, and the spirit-room was intended to be used
for manife!>tations produced by their mediumship. The
room was furnished with the appliances incidental to the
spiritualistic seance-table for rappings, tambourines, and
other musical instruments; phosphorus, by means of which
the spirits might show themselves. The phenomena
witnessed by the sitters, including Charles Partr1dge, editor
of the Spirit~cal I:elegraph, w&e of a varied nature, but in
the main identical with the other manifestations of the
same period. The spirits who visited Koon's Jog building
claimed to be a band-one hundred and sixty-five in
number-of men who had lived before the time of Adam,
and from whom were descended the well-known spirit
personalities, John and Katie King.
Kosh : The wicked forest fiend of the Bangala of the Southern
Congo.
Koshei : (See Slavs.)
Kostchtchle, or " Deathless " : A Russian goblin of the
bogle-boe species. This horrid monster is described as
having a death's head and fleshless skeleton, " through
which is seen the black blood flowing and the yellow heart
beating." He is armed with an iron club, with which he
knocks down all who come in his path. In spite of his
ugliness, he is said to be a great admirer of young girls and
women. He is avaricious, hates old and young alike, and
partlcularly those who are fortunate. His dwelling is
said to be amongst the mountains of the Koskels and the
Caucasus. where his treasure is concealed.
Kostka, Jun : The pseudonym of Jules Doinel. A late
Gnostic and initiate of the 33rd degree, who, converted to
the Christian standpoint, revealed his diabolic adventures
in the pages of La Verite under the title of "Lucifer Un-
masked." He tells of diabolic happenings in the private
chapel of a lady, " i.\iadame X." who figures frequently in
his pages, and who is thought to be the late Countess of
Caithness, of visions of Jansen, and the classical deities.
It is certain from the evidence that 1\1. Kostka never came
into personal contact v:ith a Satanic or Luciferian cultus.
and that his diabolic experiences were merely those of the
amateur Satanist.
Kramat: (See Magic.)
Krata Repoa, ·or Initiation into the ancient Mysteries of the
Prie.~ts of Egypt, written by C. F. Koppen and ]. W. B.
Von Hymmen, and published at Berlin in 1782. The
term Krata Repoa, said to be of Egyptian origin, possesses no
affinity to that language so far as the present writer is
aware. The \Vork is divided into seven grades. That of
Po5tophoris (a word used by Apuleius to signify a priest of
Isis) corresponds to the apprentice or keeper of the sacred
threshold. Secondly comes the degree of Neokaros, in
which are to be found many ordeals and temptations. The
third degree is the State of Death-of degree of judg-
m ~nt and of the pas~age of the Soul. The candidate was
restored to light in the following degree, the Battle of the
Shadows. In the fifth grade a drama of Vengeance was
enacted, and the sixth is that of the astronomer before the
gate of the gods. In the final grade the whole scheme of
initiation was expounded. It has been thought that these
degrees corresponded to the actual procedure of a secret
society, and it may be that in some measure they did, as
one of their authors was a prominent member of The
African Builders (q.v.), but althqugh there would seem to be
elements of real tradition in the work, most of it is probably
mere invention.
Krstaca : Dalmatian name for a witch. (See Slavs.)
Kund : (See Scandinavia.)
Kyphi : Among the Egyptians, an aromatic substance, with
soothing and heating properties, prepared from sixteen
materials according to the prescription of the sacred books.
L
Labadie, Jean : A fanatic of the seventeenth century, born
in 16to at Bourg, on the Dordogne. He declared himself
a second John the Baptist, sent to announce the second
coming of the Messiah. He even went .so far a.<; to claim
some measure of divinity for himself. But to his ambition
as a votary he joined a taste for more worldly pleasures,
which he indulged under the mask of religion. He died in
1674. Among his works (which were condemned) was
Le Veritable Exor&isme, au l'tmiq11e moyen de &ha.sser le
diable d1c mo11de chretien.
Labartu : (See Babylonb, also Semites.)
Laburum is a kabbalistic sign, embodied in the Great 1\fagieal
Monogram which is the seventh and most important
pantacle of the Enehir.idion.
Laeteus : A !:tone applied to rheumatic eyes.
Lady-bird : A rustic mode of divination was that practised
with the lady-bird or lady-fly. The lady-bird was captured
by a maid and bidden to fiy " north, south. or east, or
west " in the direction in which her lover lived. Which-
ever way the insect flew, there dwelt her future husband.
Lady of Lawers : One of the Breadalbane family, of Scottish
origin, and married to Campbell of Lawers. This gentle-
woman was believed to be gifted with prophetic powers,
and her prophecies are sa;d to be written in a book shaped
like a barrel and kept in the charter room of Taymouth
Castle : it is named " The Red Book of Balloch." These
forecasts all have reference to the house and lands of Bread-
albane; we give the following as an example:-" When
Lam 245 Lancashire Witches
the red cairn on Ben Lawors fell the church would split.
In the same year that the cairn, built by the sappers and
miners on Ben Lawers, fell, the Disruption in the Church of
Scotland took place."
Lam : A magical word in Hindu yoga _practice.
Lamb : Dr. Lamb was a noted sorcerer m the time of Charles
the First. The famous Richard Baxter, in his Certainty of
th~ World of Spiri~. printed in 16c}1, has recorded an
appropriate instance of the miraculous performance of this
man. ::lfeeting two of his acquaintance in the street, and
they having intimated a desire to witness some examples of
his skill, he invited them home with him. He then con-
ducted them into an inner room, where presently, to their no
small surprise, thev saw a tree spring up in the middle of
the apartment. They had scarce1y ceased wondering at
this phenomenon, when in a moment there appeared three
diminutive men, with little axes in their hands for the
purpose of cutting down this tree. The tree Wi'.S felled ;
.1nd the doctor dismissed his guests, fully satisfied of the
>olidity of his pretensions. That very night, however, a
tremendous hurricane arose, causing tho house of one of the
guests to rock from side to side, with every appearance
that the building would come down, and bury him and his
wife in the ruins. The wife in great terror asked " Were
you not at Dr. Lamb's to-day?" The husband confessed
it was true. "And did you not bring something away
from his house ? " The husband owned that, when the
little men felled the tree, he had picked up some of the
chips, and put them in his pocket. Nothing now remained
to be done but to produce the chips, and get rid of them as
fast as they could. This ceremony performed, the whirl-
wind tmmediately ceased, and the remainder of the night
passed quietly.
Dr. Lamb at length became so odious by his reputation
for these infernal practices, that the populace rose upon
him in 1640, and tore him to pieces in the streets. Nor did
the effects of his ill-fame terminate here. Thirteen years
after, a woman, who had been his servant maid, was
apprehended on a charge of witchcraft, was tried, and in
expiation of her crime was executed at.Tyburn.
Lamps, Magic : There dwelt at Paris in the time of St. Louis,
a famous Jewish Rabbi called Jachiel, a great manufacturer
of prodigies, who was regarded by the Jews as one of their
saints, and by the Parisians as a sorcerer. Durins. the
night when everyone was asleep, he was wont to work by
the light of a magic tam!? which cast through his chamber
a glow like that of day 1tself. He never replenished this
lamJ? with oil, nor otherwise attended to it, and folks began
to hmt that he had acquired it through dtabolic agencies.
If anyone chanced to knock at his door during the night
they noticed that the lamp threw out sparks of light of
various colours, but if they continued to rap the lamp
failed and the Rabbi turning from his work touched a large
nail in the middle of his table which connected magicaliy
with the knocker on the street-door, giving to the person
who rapped upon it something of the nature of an electric
shock. (Se~ France.)
Lamps of this description were supposed to be known to
the Rosicrucians, and it is said that in opening the tomb of
a daughter of Cicero several lamps were found burning
upon it. It is of course possible that the light from
these was luminous or phosphorescent and not living flame.
The magic lamp of Aladdin wilt occur to everyone in
this connection ; and romance abounds in such vehicles of
tight.
Lancashire Witches : A story with many pathetic and pitiable
features, and one which is eloquent of the ianoranoe and
credulity of the age. is that of the Lam:ashire Witches. Not
very far from i\Ianchester lies Pendelbury Forest, a gloomy
though romantic and picturesque spot. At the time when
it was inhabited by the witches-that is to s!>y, a\;ou~ tte
beginning of the 17th century-it was held in such terror
by law-abiding folks that they scarcely dared to approach
it. They imagined it to be the haunt of witches and
demons, the scene of all sorts of frightful orgies and diaboli-
cal rites. So that when Roger Newel, a country magistrate,
hit upon the plan of routing the witches out of their den, and
thus ridding the district of their malevolent influence, he
fancied he would be doing a public-spirited and laudable
action. He promptly began by seizing Elizabeth Demdike
and Ann Chattox, two women of eighty years of age, one of
them blind, and the other threatened ·with blindness, both
of them living in squalor and abject poverty. Demdike's
daughter, Elizabeth Device. and her grandchildren, James
and Alison Device, were included in the accusation. and
Ann Redferne, daughter of Chattox was apprehended with
her mother. Others were seized in quick succession-Jane
Bulcock and her son John, Alice Nutter, Catherine Hewitt,
and Isabel Roby. All of them \\ere induced-by what
means it were better not to enquire too closely-to make a
more or less detailed confession of their communication
with the Devil. When this had been extorted from them,
they were sent to prison in Lancaster Castle, some fifty
miles away, there to await trial for their misdeeds.
They had not lain in prison very long when the authorities
were informed that about twenty witches had assembled on
Good Friday, at Malkin's Tower, the home of Elizabeth
Device, in order to compass the death of one Covel, to
blow up the castle in which their companions were confmed,
and rescue the prisoners, and also to kill a man called
Lister, which last purpose they accomplished by means
of diabolical agency. Jn the summer assizes of z6IZ the
prisoners were tried for witchcraft, and were all found
guilty. The woman Demdike had died in prison, and thus
escaped a more ignominious death at the gallows. The
principal witnesses who appeared against Elizabeth Device
were her grandchildren, James and Jennet Device.
Directly the latter entered the witness-box her grandmother
set up a terrible yelling punctuated by bitter execrations.
The child, who was only nine years of age, begged that the
prisoner might be removed as she could not otherwise
proceed with her evidence. Her request was granted, and
she and her brother swore that the Devil had visited their
grandmother in the shape of a black dog, and asked what
were her wishe.<:. She had intimated that she desired the
death of one John Robinson, whereupon the fiend told her
to make a clay image of Robinson and gradually crumble
it to pieces, saying that as she did so the man's life would
decay and finally perish. On such evidence ten persons
were hanged, including the aged Ann Chattox.
It is shocking to reflect that. at a period when literature
and learning were at their height, such cruelty could be
tolerated, not only by the vulgar and uneducated, but by
the learned judges who pronounced the sentence. The
women were old and ignorant and probably weak-minded.
No doubt they began in time to mvest themselves with
those powers, which their neighbours credited to them,
and to believe themselves fit objects for the awe and
terror of the people. It is even possible that they may
have seen some sort of visions, or hallucinations. which they
persuaded themselves were evil spirits attending on them
Thus their own cunning and ignorance may have hastened
their downfall.
Twenty-two years later a similar outrage, on the same
spot. was narrowly avo!ded, by the shrewdness of the judge
who tried the case. /'. ocrtatn misguided man, by name
Edmund Robinson, thought to profit by the general belief
in witchcraft. To this end he taught his youn~ son. a boy
of eleven to say that one day he encountered 10 the fields
two dogs, with which he tried to catch a hare. But the
Lapis 246
animals wo;~ld not obey his bidding, and at length he tied
them to a post and whipped them, when they immediately
turned into a witch and her imp. This monstrous story
gained such credence that .vhen Robinson declared that
his son possessed a sort of second-sight, which er..abled him
to distinguish a witch at" glance, no one thought of denying
his statement. Accordingly, he took the boy to thE! neigh-
bouring churches, set him on a bench, and bade him point
out the witches. No less than seventeen persons were thus
accused and might have been hanged had not the judge's
suspicions been aroused by the story, for the jury did not
hesitate to convict them. However, the doubts of the
worthy judge gained a respite for the prisoners, some of
whom were sent to London for examination by the King's
phy~iciao and by the king himself. The boy's story was in-
vestigated and found to be m~rely a ti.;suc of lies, as, indeed,
the child himself confessed it to be. (See Whitaker, The
History of Whalley, p. 2fS.)
Lapis Exllls : A name applied to the Graal itself. It is thi.s
stone which causes the pho:-nix' to renew her youth. Lapis
Exilis, according to \1\'olfram von Eschenbach, was synony-
mous with the Holy Grail.
Lapis Judalcus : Also identified with the Graal and the
Talismanic stone of inexhaustible feeding power. It is
sometimes called Theolithos, and seems but another name
for the Lapis Exilis (q.v.) It hns been confounded with
the Phoemx stone. Another legend clings to it : it is
said to have fallen from the crown of Lucifer, as he was
banished from heaven, and remains in the keeping of the
angels of the air.
Lapland : The J..aplnnders have a reputation for magical
practice which is almost proverbial t-hroughout Europe,
and certainly so among the peoples of the Scandinavian
Peninsula. Indeed the Finns still credit them with extra-
ordinary power in sorcery and divination. Many Scan-
dinavian scions of nobility were in ancient times sent to
Lapland to obtain a magical reputation, and Er~c the son
of Harold Haarfager found Gunhild, daughter of Asur
Tote, sojourning among the Lapps in A.D. 922 for that
purpose. Engli~;h litenture ab~unds v;ith reference to
J.apla11d witches. But Sorcery in Laplan!! was a preserve of
the male sham:\nS or magicians. Like the Celtic ";tches
the Lapps wC;re addicted to the selling of wind or tempests in
knotted COf?CS.
Scheffer m his Lapponia (1674) writing of Lapp magic
says :-"The nrelancholic constitution of the I..aplanders,
renders them subject to frightful app:!.ritions and dreams,
which they look upon as infallible presages made to them
by the Genius of what is to bcf\lll them. Thus they are
frequently seen lying upon the ground asleep, some singing
with a full voice, others hcwling and making a hideous
noise not unlike wolves.
" Their superstitions may be imputed partly to their
living in solitudes, forests, and among the witd beasts
partly to their solitary way of dwelling separately from the
&ocietr of others, except who belong to their own families
sometimes several leagues distance. Hereafter it may be
added. that their daily exercise is hunting, it being observed
that this kind of life is apt to draw people int-:> various
superstitions, and at last to a correspondence with spirits.
:For those who lead a solitary life being frequently destitute
of human aid, have ofttimes recourse to forbidden means,
in hopes to find that aid and help among the spirits, which
they cannot find among m~n ; and what encourages them
in it is impunity, these things being committed by them,
without as much as the fe:1r of any witnesses ; wh;ch
moved ::'llr. Rheen to allege, among sundry reasons which he
gives for the continuance of the impiou~ super>titions of the
Laplanders, this for'Ortl:: because they live among inaccess-
ible mountains, and at a gre;,.t distance from tae conversa-
Lapland
tior. of other men. Another reason is the good opinion
they constantly entertain of their ancestors, whom they
cannot imagine to have been so stupid as not to understand
what God they ought to worship, wherefore they judge
they should be wanting in their reverence due to them, if,
by receding from their institutions, they should reprove
them of impiety and \gnorance.
" The parents are the masters, who instruct their own
sons in the magical art. ' Those.' says Tornaeus, ' who
have attained to this magical art by instructions receive it
either from their parents, or from somebody else, and that
by degrees which they put in practice as often as an oppor-
tunity offers. Thus they accomplish themselves in this
art, especially if their genius leads them to it. For they
don't look upon every one as afit scholar ; nay, some are
accounted quite incapable of it, notwithstanding they have
been sufficiently islstructed. as I have been informed by
very credible people.' And Joh. Tornaeus confirms it by
these words : " As the Laplanders are naturally of different
inclinations, so arc they not equally capable of attaining
to this art.' And in another passage, they bequeath the
demons as part of their inheritance, which is the reason
tbat one family excels the other in this magical art. From
whence it is evident, that certain.whole families have their
own demons, not' only differing from the familiar spirits of
others, but also qu1te contrary and opposite to them.
Besides this, not only whole families, but also particular
persons, have sometimes one, sometimes mo.re spirits
belonging to them, to secure them against the designs of
other demons, or else to hurt others. Olaus Petri Niurenius
speaks to this effect, when he says-' They arc attended by
a. certain number of spirits, some by three, others by two, or
at least by one. The last is intended for their security, the
other to hurt others. The f1rst commands all the rest.
Some of those they acquire with a great deal of pains and
prayers, some without much trouble, being their atter.dants
from their infancy.' Job. Tornaeus gives us a very large
account of it. ' There are some,' says he, ' who naturally
are magicians ; an abominable thing indeed. For those
who the devil knows will prove very serviceable to him in
th's art, he seizes on in thcir very infancy with certain
distemper, when they arc haunted with apparitions and
visions, by which they are, in proportion of their age,
instructed in the rudiments of this art. Those who are a
second time taken with this distemper, have more appar-
itions coming before them than in the first, l>y which they
receive much more insight into it than before. But if they
are seized a. third time with this disease, which theu proves
very dangeroas, and often not without the ha~ard of their
lives, tho:-n it is they sec all the apparitions the devil is able
to contrive, to accomplish them m the magical art. Those
are arrh·ed to such a de~ee of perfection, that without the
help o! the urum (see 1nfrJ.), they can foretell thing~ to
come a $r~at while before ; and a.re so strongly possessed by
the dev1l, that they foresee thing~ even against their will.
T11us, •:ot tong ago, "' certain Laplander, who is still alive,
did voluntarily deliver his drum to me, which I had often
desired of him before : notwithstanding all this, he told
me in a very melancholy posture, that though he had put
away his drum, nor intended to have any other hereafter,
yet he could foresee everything without it, as he had done
before. As an instance o! it, he told m~ truly all the
particular accidents that had happened to me in my journey
into Lapla1rd, m1king at the same time heavy complaints,
that he did not know what use to make of his eyes, those
things bC:ag presented to his Slght much against his wil!.
·• Lundius observes, that some of the Laplanders are
seized upon by a demon, when they are arr;ved to a m:ddle
age, in the following m.o.nner :- Whilst they are busie in
the woods, the spirit appears to them, where they discourse
Lapland 247
concermng the conditions, upon which the demon offers
them his assistance, which done, be teaches them a certain
song, which they are obliged to keep in constant remem-
brance. They must return the next day to the same
place, where the same spirit appears to them again, and
repeats the former song, in case he takes a fancy to the
per:>on ; if not, he does not appear all all. These spirits
make their appearances under different shapes, some like
fishes, some like birds, others like a serpent or dragon,
others in the shape of a pigmce, about a yard high ; being
attended by three, four, or five other pi~ees of the same
bigness, sometimes by more, but never exceeding nine.
No sooner are they seized by the Genius, but they appear
in the most surprising postllre, like madmen, before be-
reaved of the use of reason. This continues for six months ;
during which time they don't suffer any of their kindred to
come near them, not so much as their own wives and
children. They spend most of this time in the woods and
other solitary ;Places, being very melancholy and thought-
ful scarce taking any food, which makes them extremely
weak. It you ask their children, where and how their
parents sustain themselves, they will tell you, that they
receive their sustenance from their Genii. The same author
gives us a remark.-.hle instance of this kind in a young
Laplander called Olaus, being then a scholar in the school of
Liksala, of about eighteen years of age. This young fellow
fell mad on a sudden, making most dreadful postures and
outcries, that he was in hell, and his spirit tormented beyond
what could be expressed. If he took a book in hand, so
soon as he met with the ·name of )csus, he threw the book
upon the ground io great fury, which after some time being
passed over, they used to ask him whether he had seen any
vision during this ecstacy ? He answered that abundance
of things had appeared to him, and that a mad dog being
tied to his foot, followed him wherever he stirred. In. his
lucid intervals he would tell them, that the first beginning
of it happened to him one day, a.s he was going out of the
door of his dwelling, when a great flame passed before his
eyes and touching his ears, a certain person appeared to him
all naked. The next day he was seized with a most terrible
headache, so that he made most lamentable outcries, and
broke everything that came under his hands. This un-
fortunate person's face was as black as coal, and he used to
say, that the devil most commonly appeared to him in the
habit of a minister, in a long cloak; during his fits he would
say tbat he was surrounded by nine or ten fellows of a low
stature, who did usc him very barbarously, though at tl-.e
same time the standers-by did not perceive the least thing
like it. He would often climb to the top of the highest fir
trees, with as much swiftness as a squirrel, and leap down
again to the ground, without receiving the least hurt. He
always loved solitude, flying the conversation of other men.
He would run as swift as a horse. it being impos>ible for
anybody to overtake him. He used to talk amongst the
wood~ to him~elf no otherwise than if several persons had
been in his company. •
'' I am apt to believto~, that those spirts were not altogether
unknown to the ancients, and that they are the same which
were called by Tertullian Paredri, and are mentioned by
l\Ionsieur Valois, in his EcclesiMtical Histo.·y of Eusebius.
.. Whenever a Laplander has occasion for his familiar
spirit, he calls to him, and makes him come by only singing
the song he taught him at their first interview ; by which
means he has him at bis service as often as he pleases. And
because they know them obsequious and serviceable, they
call them Sveie, which signifies as much in their tongue, as
the compan:ons of their labour, or their helpmates. Lun-
dius has made another observation, very well worth taking
notice of, viz. :-That those spirits or demons never appear
to the women, or enter into their service, of which I don't
Lapland
pretend to allege the true cause, unless one might say,
that perhaps they do it out of pride, or a natural aversion
they have to the female sex, subJect to so many infirmities."
For the purposes of augury or divination the Lapps
enployed a magic drum, which, indeed, was in use among
several Arctic peoples. Writing in 1827, De Capell Brooke
states that the ceremonies connected with tbis instrument
had almost quite disappeared at that date. The en-
croachments of Lutheranism had been long threatening
the existence of the native shamanism. In 1671 the Lapp
drum was formally banned by Swedish law, and several
magicians were apprehended and their instruments burnt.
But before thatdate the religion which the drum represented
was in full vigour. The Lapps called their drum Ka1m11s
(Regnard, r68r), also Ka1mus, KabdM, Kabdes Gabda.s,
and Keure (Von Duben, 1 873.) its Scandinavian designations
being LYoll-trumma, or Rune-bo11m1e, " magic or runic drum,"
otherwise Spa-IYumma., ·• fortune-telling drum." J. A.
Friis hM shown that the sampo of the Finnish Kalevala is
the same instrument. According to Von Duben, the best
pictures and explanations of the drum arc to be found in
Friis's Lappisk Mythologi (Christiania, 1871), pp. 30-47,
but there are good descriptions in Von DUben·s own work
(On Lapland oc!l Lapparnc, Stockholm, 1873), as also in the
books of Scheffer, Leem, Jessen, and others. The appear-
ance of the Lapp drum is thus described by Regnard in
r68r :-Tlus instrument is made of a single piece of wood,
hollowed in its thickest part in an oval form, the under
part of which is convex, in which they make two apertures
long enough to suffer the fingers to pass through, for the
purpose of holding it more f1rmly. The upper part is
covered with the skin of the reindeer, on which they paint
in red a number of figures, arid from whence several brass
rings are seen hanging, and some pieces of the bone of the
reindeer." A wooden hammer, or, as among the Samoyeds
(x6r4), a hare's foot was used as a drum-stick in the course
of the incantation. An arpa or divining-rod wa.o; placed on
a definite spot showing from its position after sounding the
drum what magic inference might be drawn. By means
of the drum, the priest could be placed eu rapport with the
spirit world, and was thus enabled to divine the future ;
to ascertain synchronous events occurring at remote
distances ; to forecast the measure of success attending
the day's hunting; to heal the sick ; or to infiict people with
disease and cause death. Although obsolete in Laplatld
these rites are still performed amon~ the Samoyeds and
other races of Arctic Asia and Amer1ca. It is interesting
to note how exactly the procedure among the Vaigatz
Samoyedsin 1556 (Pinkerlo11's Voyages, London, x8o8, I , 63)
tallies with that of the Sakhalin Ainos in 1883 (J. l\1. Dixon
in Trans, Asiatic Soc. of Japan, Yokohama, r883, 47). The
same practices can be traced eastward through Arctic
America. and the drum is used in the same fashion by the
Eskimo shaman priests in Greenland (Henry Rink's T~e.s,
etc., 1875. 6o-61.) The shape of the drum varies a little
according to locality. The form of the Eskimo drum is that
of a tambourine.
··Their most valuable instrument of enchantment,"
says Tornaeus, " is this sorcerer's kettle-drum, which they
call Kannas or Quobdas. They cut it in one entire piece
out of a thick tree stem, the fibres of which run upwards in
the same direction as the course of the sun. The drum
is covered with the skin of an animal ; and in the bottom
holes are cut by which it may be held. Upon the skins are
many figures painted, often Christ and the Apostles, with the
heathen gods, Thor, Noorjunka., and others jumbled
together ; the ;Picture of the sun, shapes of animals, lands
and watets, cines ann roads, in short, all kinds of drawings
according to their various uses. Upon the drum there is
placed an indicator. which they call Arpa, which consists of
Larvae 2!8 Laurel
a bundle of metallic rings. The drumstick is, generally, a
reindeer's horn. This drum they preserve with the most
vigilant care, and guard it especially from the touch of a
wom~n. When they will make known what is taking
place at a distance,-as to how the chase shall succeed, how
business ·will answer, what result a sickness will have, what
is necessary for the cure of it, and the like, they kneel down,
and the sorcerer beats tbe drum; at first with light strokes,
but as he proceed9, with ever louder stronger ones, round
the index, either till this has moved in a direction or to a
figure which he regards as the answer which he bas sought,
or till he himself falls into ecstasy, when he generally lays
the kettle-d1 um on his head. Then be sings with a loud
vOice a song which they call Jogke, and the men and women
who stand round singsongs, which they call Da11ra, in which
the name of the place whence they desire information
frequently occurs. The sorcerer lies in the ecstatic state
for some time-frequently for many hours, apparently
dead, with rigid feature~; sometimes with perspiration
bursting out upon him. In the meantime the bystanders
continue their incantations, which have for their object
that the sleeper shall not lose any part of his vision from
memory ; at the same time they guard him carefulJy that
nothing Jiving may touch him-not even a fty. When he
again awakes to consciousness, be relates his·vision, answers
the questions put to him, and gives unmistakablt- evidence
of having seen distant and unknown things. The inquiry
of the oracle does not always take place so solemnly and
completely. In everyday matters as regards the chase,
etc., the Lapp consultS his drum without falling into the
somnambulic crisis. On the other hand. a more highly
developed state of prophet! vision may take place without
this instrument, as has already been stated. Claudi
relates, that at Bergen, in No·rway, the clerk of a German
merchant demanded of a Norwegian Finn-Laplander what
his master was doing in Germany. The Finn promised to
give him the intelligence. He began then to cry out like
a drunken man, and to run round in a circle, till he fell, as
one dead, to the earth. After a while he woke again, and
gave the answer, which time showed to be correct. Finally,
that many, while wholly awake, free from convul~ions
and a state of unconsciousness, are able to become
clairvoyant, is placed beyond aU doubt by the account of
Tornaeus.
" The use which they make of their power of clairvoy·
ance, and their magic arts, is, for the most part, good and
innocent ; that of curing sick men and animals ; inquiring
into far-off and future things, which in the confined sphere
of their existence is important to them. There arc instances
however, in which the magic art is turned to the injury of
others."

Larvae : (See Maglo.)
Lasoarls : (Alchemist of the Eighteenth Century.) It is
impossible to determine the date at which this mysterious
personage was born, or to say, exactly, whence he came
and where be chiefly lived. He is commonly supposed
to have been active about the beginning of the eighteenth
ce::~tury, while Germany is held to have been the principal
scene of his activitie9 ; but everything recorded concerning
him reads like a romance, and suggests the middle ages
rather than the day before yesterday. Sometimes he
assured people that be was of Oriental origin, sometimes he
maintained that his native land was the Ionian Isles, and
that he was a scion of the Greek royal bouse of Lascaris ;
while on other occasions be declared that he was an
archimandrite of a convent in the Island of Mytilene, and
that his object in coming to Europe was t,., solicit alms for
the ransom of Christian prisoners in the East. Such was his
tale when, about I 700, he commenced wandering in Ger-
many, and, while sojourning at Berlin, he happened to fall
ill and sent for medical aid. This appeared shortly in the
shape of a young apothecary, Johann Friedrich BOtticher
by name, who chanced to be deeply interested in alchemy,
so a niendship sprang up between ~_>hysician and patient
and ere Lascaris left ~he Prussian capttal he gave BOtticher
a packet of transmutin$ powder, at the same time instruct-
ing him how to use 1t successfully, yet refraining from
telling him how to manuiacture the powder itself. Nothing
daunted, Botticher set to work speedily, concocted con-
siderable quantities of gold and silver, grew rich, and was
rlt..ised to the peerage; while simultaneously he began to find
his society, and more especially his services as a scientist,
courted by kings and nobles. 1\feanwb..ile, however, his
supply of the precious powder had run short, and being
unable to make more he found his reputatiol} waning
apace ; while worse still, be bad spent his newly-acquired
wealth speei!ily, and now he found himself reduced to
penury. UltimatelY. he was incarcerated, but during his
period of durance v1le he set himself to the manufacture of
porcelain, and by the sale of this he eventually restored his
fallen fortunes.
We presume naturally that it was gratitude to his physi-
cian which inspired the crafty alchemist to give Botticher
the powder, but why did Lascaris make an analogous
present at a later date ? The recipient on this occasion
being one Schmalz de Dierbach, a lieutenant-colonel in the
Polish Army. He, like the German apothecary. succeeded
in making a quantity of gold, and, though we hear no more
about him after this transmutation, we learn that a certain
Baron de Creux was likewise favoured by Lascaris, the
Baron's experiments proving just as successful as those of
the others aforesaid. Nor were these the only people on
whom our alchemist 'bestowed his indulgence, for one
Domenico :Manuel, the son of a Neapolitan mason, was
likewise given a packet of transmutatory powder, and,
armed thus, be wandered through Spain, Belgium, and
Austria, performing operations beforeyrinces and noblemen.
and reaping wealth accordingly. Pride was the inevitable
result of this, and though there is no reason to suppose that
any patent of nobility was ever conferred on Domenico,
we find him styling himself now Comte Gautano, now
Comte di Ruggiero; while in one town he maintained that
he was a Prussian major-general, and elsewhere he declared
that he was field-marshal of the Bavarian forces. Goi~
to Berlin in the course of his perambulations, he offered
to make gold in the presence of the king ; but alas I his
operation proved utterly futile, and he was banged as a
charlatan in consequence. This was in 1709, and in tbe-
saJTle year, according to tradition. La.scaris himself performed
some successful transmutations before a German politician
named Liebknecb, a citizen of Wurtembourg. Nothing
further is heard of the mysterious Greek alchemist, however,
so it may be assumed that he died soon after these events.
His was a curious career indeed : his generosity having-
scarcely a parallel in the whole history of hermetic philoso-
phy.

Laurin or Der Kleine Rosengarten : A Tyrolese romance of
the late thirteenth century. Laurin, a dwarf, possesses a
magic rose-garden into which no one may enter without the
loss of a hand or a foot. Dietrich and his follower Witege,
enter it, and the latter rides through the rose bushes.
Laurin, the dwarf, appears, on horseback and dis-
mounts Witege. He is challenged by Dietrich and, assum-
ing his cloak of invisibility, wounds him. Dietrich now
persuades him to a wrestling match and ·wrenches off the
dwarf's belt which gives him super-human strength. Thus
he overthrows Laurin. Laurin then invites Dietrich and
his followers to his mounbin home, prepares them a
banquet, makes them tipsy. and throws them all into a
dungeon. They are released by Kiinhild, a moital woman,
who restores their weapons. They take Laurin prisoner
and carry him to Bern where he becomes a Christian convert
and receives Kiinhild in marriage.
Law. William : English Mystic and Theologian (t686-t761.)
William Law was born at Kingsclifie, Northamptonshire,
in the year t686. His father followed the humble calling of
a grocer, but it is manifest that: he was in tolerably affluent
circumstances nevertheless, and ambitious besides, for in
1705 William was sent to Cambridge University. Entering
Emmanuel Colle~e. he became a fellow thereof in 17II, but
on the accession of George I. he felt himself unable to sub·
scribe the oath of allegiance, the inevitable consequence
being that he forfeited his fellowship. In 1727 he went t o
Putney, having acquired there the post of tutor to the
father of Edmund Gibbon, the historian of the Roman
Empire in decline, and he acted in this capacity for t en
years, winning universal esteem the while for his piety and
his theological erudition. In 1737, on the death of his
e.mployer, Law retired to his native village of Kingscliffe,
and it would seem that thenceforth he was chiefly supported
by the purses of some of his devotees, notably l\'liss Hester
Gibbon, sister of his guardian pupil, and a widow named
Mrs. Hutcheson. These two ladies had a united income of
fully £3ooo a year, so Law must have been comfortable
indeed, yet wealth and luxury did not tend to corrupt his
piety, and it is recorded that he was wont to get up every
morning at five, and spe.nd several hours before breakfast
in prayer and meditations. At a considerably earlier stage
in his career he had begun publishin.g theses on mysticism,
and on religion in general ; and now, being blessed with
abundance of leisure, and having acquired fresh inspiration
from reading the works o! Jacob Bo:.-hme, he produced
year after year a considerable mass of writing. Thus his
life passed away placidly, and he died in 1761.
Law's works amount in all to some twenty volumes.
" In sheer intellectual strength Law is fully abreast of the
very foremost of his illustrious contemporaries, while in
that fertilising touch which is the true test of genius, Law·
stands simply alone." Numerous other encomiums no less
enthusiastic than this have been offered to the mystic, and
it is notew_orthy that he has engaged the interest of many
great writers. Sir Leslie Stephen, for example, deals with
him in his His1ory of English Thought in the Eighteenth
Cetllury, and again in his pleasant Studies of a Biographer ;
while the mystic figures also in the brilliant pages of W. E. H-
Lecky, and in Gibbon's Autobiography he is hailed as '' a
worthy and pious man, who believed all that he professed,
and practised all that he enjoined."
Laya Yoga : ':l'hat practice of the yogi by which he listens
to sounds which can be heard within his own body when
the ears are closed. These sounds are termed" The Nada,"
and are of all kinds, from the roar of the ocean to the·
humming of bees.
Lazare, Denys : A prince of Serbia who lived in the year of
the Hegira, 788. He was author of a work entitled DYeams,
published in t 686. He himself claimed to have had noc-
turnal visions.
Le Normand, Marie ; Known as" The Sybil of the Faubourg
Saint Germaiti," was born at Alen~on in 1772 and died at
Paris in 1843. She was one of the most famous occultists
and diviners of her day; but it might justly be said that
her art was much more the product of sound judgment
than of any supernatural gift. She predicted their futures
to Marat, Robespierre, and St. Just, but we bear no more
of her under the Directory. When Josephine Beauharnais
came into prominence as the intended wife of Napoleon,
Mlle. Le Normand was received at all those houses and.
salons where the future empress bad any influence. Jose-
phine was extremely credulous, and used to read her own
fortunes to herself on the cards ; but when she found that
Mlle. Le Norma11d was an adept at this art, she often had
her in attendance to assist ber in it. Even Napoleon
himself who was not without his own superstitions, had his
horoscope read by her. She soon set up her own salon in
Paris where she read people's fortunes by means of the
cards. It is not stated whether these cards were of the-
nature of Tarot cards, but it is more than likely that they
were ; but we know that she occasionally divined tb~
fortunes of others through playin~ the games of piquet,
sept, and other card games. She d1d not hide her methods
from others, but the Parisian society of her day appears to
have thought that her.power of divination lay not in the
cards she manipulated but in her personality. It has
been stated by 1\lligne that she did use the Tarot, but as he-
calls them "German cards," one cannot attach much
importance to his statement. After the fall of the Emperor
she was the rage amongst the Russian, Gennan and English
officers in Paris, and even the Emperor Alexander and
other potentates consult ed ber. Shortly after thts she
went to Brussels, where she read the fortune of the Prince
of Orange, but as she tried to cheat the customs she soon
found herself the occupant of a Belgian prison. By the
ye!lr 1830 she had become quite forgotten, and when the
newspapers announced her death on June 25th, 1843. th~
majority of people failed to remember her name. There
is very little doubt• that she was a harmless charlatan
though several contemporary historians appear to considet
that she possessed mischievous tendencies ; but the au
of omniscience and mystery with which she surrounded
herself was so absurd that by the majority of people she
was look~.d upon, probably with j u!ltice, as a mere impostor.
His dibut as a writer was made in 1717, with an examination
of certain tenets lately promulgated from the pulpit by the
Bishop of Bangor ; and this was followed soon afterwards
by a number of analogous writings, whlle in 1726 he em-
ployed his pen to 1.ttack the•theatre, bringing out a book
entitled The A bsolute Uulawfulness of the Stage Ente.-tain-
menl f ully Demonst.-ated. In the same :year he issued A
P.-actical T.-eatise upon Christian Pe.-fectlon, and this was
followed shortly by A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy
Life, adapted to the State and Condition of all Orders of
Christians. This last is the best-known of uis works, but
others which it behoves to cite are Th& Grounds a11d Reason
of Christian Reget~eration (1739), The Spirit of Prayer
(1749), T he Way to Divine Knowledge (1752), The Spit-it of
LDve (1752), and Of Justification by Faith and Works (t76o).
Most of the foregoing, but especially the Serious Call, have
been reprinted again and again; while in 1762 a collected
edition of Law's wvrks was published, and in 1893 there
appeared a sort of anthology, made up of extracts from the
\VOter, chosen by Dr. Alexander \Vhyte. In his preface the
~itor speaks of Law's " golden books," while he adds that

Levi, Ellphas : Alphonse Louis Constant, better known by
b.is pen-name of Eliphas Levi, was a French occultist of the
nineteenth century, who has been called " the last of the
magi." He was born about 1810, the son of a shoemaker,
and through the good offices of the parish priest was
educated for the church at St. Sulpice. In due course he
became a deacon, taking a vow of celibacy. Shortly after
this he was expelled from St. Sulpice for teaching d.octrines
..:ontrary to those of the Church. How he lived during the
ensuing years is not known, but about 1839 under the
influence of a political and socialistic prophet named
Ganneau, he wrote a pamphlet entitled Tlte Gospel of
Liberty. for wb.ich he received six months imprisonment.
In Paris, notwithstanding his vow of celibacy, he married
a beautiful fir! of sixteen, who afterwards had the marriage
annulled. t was probably not until Madame Constant
had left b.im that he studied the occult sciences. At all
events b.is writings previous to this show little trace of
occult influence. In 1855 he published b.is Doctrine of
Transcuzdental l11agic, followed in 1856 by the Ritual of
1'ranscendeutal Magic; in r86o was issued his .History of
.'V!agic; in r86t The /(ey of the Grand Mysteries ; Fables
and Symbols in 1864 ; Le Sorcier de J'llendOil and La Science
des Esprits in 1865. Most of his works have been trans·
lated by :Mr. A. E. Waite. He died in 1875.
Levi's knowledge of the occult sciences was much more
imaginative than circumstantial, and in perusing his works
the reader requires to be on his guard against the adoption
o! nasty generalisations and hypotheses.
Leviathan : (See Devil.)
.Levitation : A term in use among spiritualists to denote
the raising in the air of the human body or other objects
without visible means, and presumably through the agency
of disembodied spirits. Thus the levitaJion of tables and
other more or less weighty objects is a common feat among
•· physical " mediums, whether or not a supernatural
explanation be required. The witches of olden times, too,
were popularly suppos~ to make use of some occult mode
of locomotion in their nocturnal travels, being transported
through the air by the arts of their master, the Devil.
And the poltergeist was also thought to suspend in the air,
without v1sible means of support, the agent through whom
he manifested himself. As a spiritualistic phenomenon
levitatio11 of the human body became known at an early
stage of the movement, being reco:ded in connection with
the medium Gordon so early as 1851. But the most im-
portant of levitated mediums was D. D. Home, and many
accounts of b.is feats in tb.is direction are given by witnesses
who were themselves convinced of their genuineness. It
may be noted, however, that levitations usually occurred in
a darkened seance-room, when the only indication of any
untoward happening was furnished by the medium's own
exclamations, by the fact that his voice seemed to come
from b.igh in the air, and sometimes by b.is boots scraping
the back of a chair or the hand of one of the sitters. The
Rev. Stainton Moses, who also was levitated on several
occasions, seems to have held his se<'.nces in darkness also,
or at most by the light of the .fire. 1\lrs. Guppy (nee
Nicholls) was before her marriage several times levitated,
notwithstanding the fact that she was extremely stout , and
a curious story concerninga later levittttio11 is told in a letter
in the Echo of June 8th, 1871. for whose (anonymous)
author's trustworthiness the editor vouches. About that
time the writer attended a circle with :Messrs. Herne and
Williams as mediums, the spirits present being the famous
John and Katie King. One of the sitters jokingly expressed
a ";sh that Mrs. Guppy (then in her home some three miles
distant) might be brought to the seance-room, and to this
Katie King was heard to assent. While the company were
laughing at the absurdity of the idea, there was a loud
bump, followed by shrieks and exclamations. A match
was struck, and there in the centre of the table stood Mrs.
Guppy, an account·book in one hand, a pen in the other,
and apparently in a stateof trance. Less than three minutes
elapsed between the expression of the ·wish and the appear-
ance of }Irs. Guppy. The writer adds: " The possibility
of her being concealed in the room is as absurd as the idea
of her acting in collusion with the media."
Pseudo·historical instances of levitatioiJ may be found in
abundance, especially among the early saints. St. Dun-
stan, archbishop of Canterbury, was observed to rise from
the ground shortly before his death in 988. St. Bernard
Ptolomei, St. Philip Benitas, St. Albert of Sicily, and St.
Dominic, founder of the Dominican order, were all seen
to be levitated while engaged in their devotion3. An
ec.~tatic nun " rose from the ground with so much impetu-
osity. that five or six of the sisters could hardly hold her
down." It is related by his biographers that Savonarola,
shortly before he perished at the stake, remained suspended
at a considerable height above the fioor of b.is dungeon,
absorbed in prayer. And such instances might easily be
multiplied.
Levlticon : A g0spel adopted by the French Templars, and
alle~ed by them to have been discovered in the Temple at
Pans, along with other objects. It was supposed to have
been composed in the fifteenth century by a Greek monk,
Nicephorus. who sought to combine ;vioslem tenets with
Christianity.

Loodun, Nuns of : In the ye1.r i6JJ, the convent of Un;ulines
established at Loudun in France was the scene of an out-
break of diabolical possession. The numerous nuns who
inhabited the convent showed signs of diabolic possession,
spoke with tongues, apd behaved in the most extraordinary
and hysterical manner. The afil\ir grew in volume until
practically all the wens belonging to the institution were
in the same condition of temporary insanity. The Mother
Superior of the convent, Jeanne de Belliel, appears to have
been of hysterical temperament, and she was not long in
infecting the other inmates of the institution. She, with a·
sister named Claire and five other mms, were the first to be
obsessed by t.he so-called evil spirits. The outbreak spread
to the neighbouring town and so scandalous did the whole
affair become that Ri.chelieu appointed a commission to
examine into it. The devils were subjected to the process
of exorcism, which, however, proved to be fruitless in tbis
instance. and the att:1.cks of the mm~ continued. But on a
more imposing ceremony being held, they took themselves
off, but only for a little while, returning again with greater
violence than ever. Suspicion, or rather injustice, fixed
upon the person of Urbl\in Crandier (q.v.}, confessor of the
convent, as the head and source of the whole affair. He
was arrested and accused of giving over the nuns to the
possession of the Devil by means of the practice of sorcery.
The truth is that the nci~hbouring clergy were madly
jealous of Crandier because he had obtained two benefices
in their diocese, of wbich he was not a native, and they had
made up their minds to compass his destruction at the
tirst possible moment. Despite his protests of innocence,
the unfortunate priest was baled before a council of judges
of the neighbouring presidencies, who found upon his body
the various marks which were the undoubted signs of a
sorcerer, and it is said that the inquest brought to light
the fact that Grandier had none too good a reputation.
\Ve must be very careful, however, to refrain f10m believing
the worst about him, as the sources regarding this are
undoubtedly tainted by religious prejudice. It is said that
on his papers being seized much matter subven;ive of
religious practice was found amongst them. They failed.
however, to find that pact with Satan for wbich they bad
looked, although afterwards several versions of it were
published by more or less credulous persons and sold as
broadsheets. The unfortunate man was condemned to be
burnt at the stake-a sentence which was duly cru-ried out.
After his death, however, the possession of the hysterical
sisters did not cease ; the demons became more obstreperous
than ever and flippantly answered to their namc.>s oJ
Asmodeus, Leviathan, and Behemoth, and so forth. A
very holy Brother ralled Surin was delegated to put an end
to the aliair. Frail and unhealthy, he possessed, however,
an indomitable spirit, and after much wrestling in prayer
succeeded in finally exorcising the demons. The whole
affair Is set forth in tho Hislorie des Diables de Loudu11,
published in 1839, which gave a detailed account of one of
the most extraordinarv obsessions of modern times.

Loyer, Pierre Le : Sieur de Ia Brosse, royal councillor and
demonographer, was born at Huill~ in Anjou in 1550. He
was the author of a work entitled Discours et histoires des
spectres, visions et apparitiom des esprits, anges. demons et
am8s se montra111 aux hommes. The work is divided into
eight books dealing with the marvellous visions and prodi-
gies of all the centuries. and the most celebrated authors
sacred as well as profane, who have dealt with occult sub-
jects, the cause of apparitions, the nature of good and evil
spirits, of demons, of ecstasy, of the essence, nature and
origin of souls, of magicians and sorcerers, of the manner
of their communication, of evil spirits, and of impostors
It was published at Paris in 16o5 in one quarto volume.
The first book deals with spectres, apparitions and spirits ;
the second with the physics of Loyer's time, the illusions to
which the senses are prone, wonders, the elixirs and
metamorphascs of sorceries and of philtres ; the third
book establishes the degrees, grades anti honours of spirits,
gives a resume of the history of Pbilinnion and of Poly-
cotes, and recounts diverse adventures \\>ith spectres and
demons ; the fourth book gives many examples of spectral
appearances, of the speech of persons possessed of demons, of
the countries and dwelling-places of these spectres and
demons, of marvellous portents, and so forth ; the fifth
treats of the science of the soul, of its origin, nature. its
state after death, and of haunting ghosts ; the sixth division
is entirely taken up with the apparition of souls, and shows
how the happy do not return to earth, but only those
whose souls are burning in purgatory ; in the sevE>nth b<lok
the case of the Witch of Endor, and the evocation of the
soul of Samuel, are dealt with, as is evocation in general
and the methods practised by wizards and sorcerers in this
science ; the last book gives some account of exorcism,
fumigations, prayers, and other methods of casting out
devils, and the usual means employed by exorcists to
destroy these. The work as a whole is exceedingly curious
if disputatious and a little dull in parts, and throws con-
siderable light upon the occult science of the times.

ology, the grand justiciary of Hades. He is the ftrst to be
invoked in the litanies of the Sabbath. (See Devil-worship.)
Lugh : In Irish romance, son of Kian, and father of Cuchulain.
He was brought up by his uncle Goban, the Smith, and by
Duach, King of Fairyland. It was prophesied of Lugh
that he should eventually overcome his father's old enemy
Balor, his own grandfather. So instead of killing the
three murderers of his father, Kian, he put them on oath
to obtain certain wonders, including the magical spear of
the King of " Persia " and the pig-skin of the Kiug of
Greece, which, if laid on a patient, would heal him of his
wound or cure him of his sickness. Thus equipped, Lugh
entered the Battle of Moytura, against the Fomorians,
and by hurling a stone which pierced through the eye to
the brain of Balor, fulfilled the druidic prophecy. Lugh
was the Irish Sun-god ; his final conquest of the Fomorians
and their leader symbolises the victory of light and intellect
over darkness. Bator was ~od of darkness, and brute force
as embodied in the Fomonans. By his title of lldanach.
or " All Craftsman," Lugh is comparable to the Greek
Apollo. He was widely worshipped by Continental Celts.
Lully, Raymond : The life of this alchemist was a curious and
eventful one, :lnd all its diverse chapters bespeak him a
man of titanic physical and mental energy, quite incapable
of doing anything in dilettante fashion, but mstead throw-
ing himself heart and soul into every quest which chanced
to appeal to him. Raymo11d's father was a Spanish knight,
who, having won the approval of john 1., Kin~ of Arragon,
was granted an estate m Majorca; and it was m that island
of the Balearic group that the future alchemist was born,
probably in the year 1229, bub the date is uncertain.
Thanks to the royal favour which his father enjoyed,
Raymond was appomted Seneschal of the Isles while he was
still a mere youth ; but hardly had he acquired this position
ere, much to the chagrin of hiS parents, he began to show a
strong predilection for debauchery. He paid amorous
addresses to women of all sorts, while at length, becoming
enamoured of a married lady named Eleonora de Castello,
be begc\n to follow her wherever she went, making no
attempt! to conceal his illicit passion. On one occasion,
indeed, he actually sought the lady while she was attend-
ing mass. And, so loud was the out~ry against this told. if
not sacril~gious act, that Eleonora found it essl'ntial to
write in peremptory style to her cavaliere servente, bidding
him desist from his present course. The Jette: failed to
cool the youth's ardour, bub anon, when it transpired that
the lady was smitten with the deadly complaint of cancer,
her admirer's frame of mind beg:~.n to alter speedilv.
Sobered by the frustration of his hopes, be vowed that
henceforth he would live differently, consecrating his days
to tli.e service of God.
So Raymond espoused holy orders, but, as was natural in
the case of a man of such active and impetuous tempera-
ment, he felt small inclination for monastic life. His aim
was to carry the Gospel far afield, converting the children
of :\fahomet, and with this in view he began to study
Arabic; while having m:\stered that tongue he proceeded
to Rome, eager to enlist the Pope's sympathy in his project.
Raymo11d failed in the latter particular, yet, nothing daunted
he embarked on his own ::.ccount at Gentla about the year
1291, and having re'lched l'unLo; he commenced his crusade.
His ardour resulted in his bein~ fiercelr persecuted and
ultim:J.tely banished : so perforce he returned for a while ~o
Europe, visiting Paris, Xaples and Pis:~., and exhorting all
good Chri'ltians to aid his beloved enterprise. But in J 308
he ventured to go back to Africa, and :~.t Al~iers he made
a hoo;t of converts, yet wa'\ once more fOt"ced to fly for his
life before the angry _\lussulmans. H.} repaired to Tunis,
thinking to escape thence to Italy, but his former activities
in the town were rem~mhered. and consequently he was
seized and thrown into prison. Here he l.'\nguished for a
long time, never failing to seize every opportunity which
presented itself of pre:l.Ching the gospel, but at last some
Genoese merchants contrived to procure his release, and
so he sailed bJ.ck to Italy. Proceeding to Rome, he made
further .nd strenuous efforts towards obtaining the Pope's
support of a well-equipped foreign mission; but Raymond's
importunity herein proved abortive, and, after resting for a
brief space at his native Majorca, the heroic zealot took his
life in his bands. and returned to Tunis. Here he even pro-
claimed his presence publicly, but scarcely had he begun
preaching when he reaped the ine,·itable harvest, and after
being savagely attacked he was left lying on the sea-shore,
his assailants imagining him dead. He was ~till breathing.
however, when some Genoese found him. and carrying him
to a ship they set sail !01 Major.:::!.. But the missio:~ar~' did
not rally, and he died while in sight of his horne, the date
being 1315.
Raymond's proselytising ardour had made his name
familiar throughout Europe, and, while inany people
regarded him as a heretic because he had undertaken a
mission without the pope's sanction, there were others who
admired him so much that they sought to make him a
saint. But he was never canonized, and the reason, per-
haps, lay in the well-known fact that he had engaged in
alchemy. He is reported to have made a large sum of
gold for the English king, and, while there is really no
proof that he ever visited Britain, the remaining part of
the story Ltolds a certain significance. For it is said that
Lttlly made the money on the strict understanding that it
should be utilised for equipping a large and powerful band
of missionaries, and the likelihood is that he thought to
employ his chymical skill on behalf of his beloved object,
and approached so:nc European Sovereign with this in
view, thus giving rise to the tradition about his dealings
with the English monarch. Be that C\S it may, Raymo11d's
voluminous writings certainly include a number of alehem-
istic works, notably Alchimia Magic Natura/is, De Aquis
Super Accurtationes, De S4cretis Medicina 111agna and De
Conservatione Vitm; and it is interesting to find that
several of these won considerable popularity and were
repeatedly reprinted, wbile so late as 1673 two volumes of
Opera Afchima purporting to be from Raymond's pen were
issued at London. Five years before this a biography by
Vernon had been published at Paris, while at a later date a
German historian of chemistry, Gruelin, referred to Lully as
a scientist of exceptional skill, and mentioned him as the
first man to distil rosemary oil.
Luminous Bodies : Dead bodies are frequently supposed t o
glow in the dark with a sort of phosphorescent light.
Possibly the belief arose from the idea that the soul was
like a fire dwelling in the body.
Luther, Martin : The Rosicrucian. (See Rosleruelnns.)
Lutin, The : The Lutin oi Normandy in many respects
resembled Robin Goodfellow. Like him he bad many names
and like him had the power of assuming many forms;
Lux 255
but the Lutin's pranks were usually of a more serious nature
than those of the tricky spirit of Merrie England. Many a
man laid his ruin at the L11tia's door, although it must be
confessed that in these cases neighbours were uncharitable
enough to say, that the Lutill had less to do with it than
habits of Want-of-Thrift and Sel£-Indulgence. Thus, on
market days, when a farmer lingered l<;.tc over his ale,
whether in driving a close bargain or in enjoying the
society of a boon companion, he declared the Lutin was
sure to play him some spiteful trick on his way home :
his horse would stumble-he would be thrown-be would
lose his purse-or else his way. If the 'farmer persisted
in these habits, more serious would become the Lutin's
tricks ; the sheep-pens would be unfastened, the cow-bouse
and stable doors left open, and the flocks and cattle be
found moving among the standing corn and unmown hay ;
while every servant on the farm would swear to his own
innocence, and unhesitatingly lay the blame oh the Lutin.
Similar tricks were played on the fishermen by the Nain
Rouge-another name for the Lutin. He opened the
meshes of the nets and set the fish free ; he removed the
floats and let the nets sink to the bottom, or the sinkers,
and let the nets float away on the retiring tide. True, if
closely questioned, the fishermen would confess that on
these occasions the night was dark and sto~my, the bothy
warm, and the grog plentiful, and that instead of drawing
their nets at the proper time, they had delayed it till morn-
ing. Again, he would appear like a black nag, ready
bridled and saddled, quietly feeding by the way-side; but
woe to the luckless wight who mounted him !-unless,
indeed, he did so for some charitable or holy purpose, in
which case be was borne with the speed of the wind to his
destination. In this form the Lutit~ played his wildest
pranks and was called Le Cheval Bayard.
Lux : (Su Spain.)
Lycanthropy : The transformation of a human being into an
animal. The term is derived from the Greek words,
lukos a wolf, and anthropos a man, but it is employed
re~arding a transformation into any animal shape. It is
chiefly in these countries where wolves are numerous that
we find such tales concerning them. (See Wer-wolf.) But
in India, and some parts of Asia, the tiger takes the place
of the wolf ; in Russia and elsewhere the bear, and in
Africa the leopard.
It is usually savage animals regarding which these beliefs
are prevalent, but even harmless ones also figure in them.
There is considerable confusion as to whether such trans-
formations were voluntary, or involuntary, temporary or
permanent. The man as transformed into the animal may
be the very individual himself, or, ou the other hand may
be only his double, that is his spirit may enter tbe animal
and his body remain unchanged. .Mag1cians and witches
were credited with the power of transforming themselves
into wolves and other animal shapes, and it was asserted
that if the animal were wounded that the mark.<> of the
wound would be cliscovercd upon the wizard's body.
The. be.li~f is current amongs~ many savage tribes that
every mdiVldual possesses an an1mal form which he enters
at death, or at will. This is effected either by magic or
natural agency.
As has been said, the wolf is a common form of animal
transformation in Europe. In ancient Greece the belief
was associated with the dog, which took the place of the
wolf. Other similar beliefs are found in India and Java
and in the former c~untry we find the wer-wolf in a sort
of vampire form.
Guyon relates the history of an enchanter who used to
change himself into different beasts.
" Certain people," said be, " persuaded Ferdinand, first
Emperor of th'lt name, to command the presence of a
Lycanthropy
Polish enchanter and magician in the town of Nuremberg
to learn the result of a difference be bad \~ith the Turks,
concerning the kingdom of Hungary ; and not only did
the magician make usc of dh·ination, but.Performed various
other marvels, so th.at the king did not w1sh to sec h'm, but
the courtie~s introduced him into his chamber. There he
did many wonderful things, among others, he transformed
himself inlo a horse, anointing himself with some grease,
then he took the shape of an ox, and thirdly that of a lion,
all in less than an hour. The emperor was so terrified by
these transformations that he commanded that the magician
should be immediately dismisssed, and declined to bear the
future from the lips of such a rascal."
" It need no longer ~doubted," adds the same writer,
" that Lucius Apuleius Plato was a sorcerer, and that he
was transformed into an ass, forasmuch as he was charged
with it before the proconsul of Africa, in the time of the
Emperor Antonine J., in the year 150 A.D., as Apollonius
of Tyana, long before, in the year 6o, was charged before
Domitian with the same crime. And more than three
years after, the rumour persi.'lted to the time of St. Augus-
tine, who was an African, who has written and confirmed
it; as also in his time the father of one Prcst~ntius was
transformed into a horse, as the said Prestantius declared.
Augustine's father having died, in a short time the
son had wasted the greater part of his inheritance in
the pursuit of the magic arts, and in order to flee poverty he
sought to marry a rich widow named Pudentille, for such
a long time that at length she consented. Soon after her
only son and heir, the child of her former mMriage, died.
These things came about in a manner which led people t()
think that he had by means of maBie entrapped Pudentille,
whohad been wooed in vain byseveral illustrious people, in
order to obtain the wealth of her son. It was also said that
the profound knowledge he possessed-for he was able to
solve difficult questions which left other men bewildered-
was obtained from a demon or familiar spirit be possessed.
Further, certain people said they bad seen him do many
marvellous things, such as making himself in.,;sible, trans-
forming himself into a horse or into a bird, piercing his body
with a sword without wounding himself, and similar per-
formances. He was at last accused by one Sicilius <Emi!.ia-
nus, the censor, before Claudius Maximus, proconsul of
Africa, who was said to be a Christian ; but nothing was
found against him.
Now, that he had been transformed into an ass, St.
Augustine regards as indubitable, he having read it in cer-
tain true and trustworthy authors, and being besides of the
same country; and this transformation happened to him
in Thessaly before he was versed in magic, through tt.e spell
of a sorceress, who sold him, and who recovered him to his
former shape after he had served in the capacity of an ass
for some years, having the same powers and habits of eating
and braying as other asses, but with a mind still sane and
reasonable as he himself, attested. And at last to show
forth his case, and to lend probability to the rumour, he
wrote a book entitled The Goldm Ass, a melange of fables
and dialogues, to expose the vices of the men of his time,
which be had heard of, or seen, during his ~ransformation,
with many of the labours and troubles be ha.d suffered while
in the shape of an ass.
" However that may be, St. Augustine in the book of the
City of God, book XVIII., chapters XVII. and XVIII.,
relates that in his time there were in the Alps certain
sorceresses who gave a particular kind of cheese to the
passers by, who, on partaking of it, \\·ere immediately
changed into asses or other beasts of burden, and were
made to carry heavy weights to certain places. When
their task was over, they were permitted to regain their
human shape."
Lycanthropy 256
" The bishop of Tyre, historian, writes that in his time,
probably about x-zzo, some Englishmen were sent by their
king to the aid o£ the Christians who were fighting in the
Holy Land, and that on their arrival in a haven o£ the
island o£ Cyprus a sorceress transformed a young English
soldier into an ass. He, wishing to return to his com-
panions in the ship, was chased away with blows from a
stick, whereupon be returned to the sorceress who made
use of him, until someone noticed that the ass kneeled in a
church and did various other things which only a reasoning
being could do. The sorceress who followed him was
taken on suspicion before the authorities, was obliged to
give him his human form three years after his transforma-
tion, and was forthwith executed."
··We read," says Loys Guyon, "that Ammonius, a
1'eripatetic philosopher, about the time of Lucius Sep-
timius Severns, in the year 196 A.D., had present at his
lessons an ass whom be taught. I should think that this
.ass had been at one time a inan, and that be quite under-
stood what Ammonius taught, for these transformed
persons retain their reason unimpaired, as St. Augustine
.and other writers have assured us."
" Fulgose writes, book Vlll., chapter II., that in the
time of Pope Leon, who Jived about the year 930, there
were in Germany two sorceresses who used thus to change
their guests into beasts, and on one occasion she changed
a young mountebank into an ass, who, preserving his
human understanding, gave a great deal of amusement to
the passers-by. A neighbour of the sorceresses bought the
ass at a good price, but was warned by them that he must
not take the beast to a river, or he would lose it. Now
-the ass escaped one day and running to a near-by lake
plunged into the water, when he returned to his own shape.
Apuleirs says that he regained his human form by eating
roses.
" There are still to be seen in Egypt asses which are led
into the market-place to perlorm various feats of agility
.and tricks, understanding all the commands they receive,
and executing them : such as to point out the most beauti-
ful woman of the company. and many other things that
one would hardly believe ; and Beton, a physician, relates
in his observations that he has seen them, and others also.
>YhO have been there, and who have affirmed thesame to me."
.. One day there was brought to St. Macarius, the
Egyptian," says Calmet, " an honC3t woman who had been
transformed into a mare by the \\;eked art of a magician.
Her husband and all who beheld her believed that she had
really been changed into a marc. Tnis woman remained
for three days without talcin(l any food, whether suitable
for a horse or for a human bemg. She was brought to the
priests of the place, who could su(lgest no remedy. So
they led her to the cell of St. l\1acanus. to whom God had
revealed that she was about to come. His disciples wished
to send her away, thinking her a mare, and they warned
the saint of her approach, and the reason for her journey.
He said to them : • It is you who are the animals, who
think you see that which is not ; this woman is not changed,
but your eyes are bewitched." As he spoke he scattered
holy water on the head of the woman, and all those present
saw her in her true shape. He had something given her to
eat and sent her away safe and sound with her husband."
Lytton, Bulwer : Author (18o3- 187J). According to his
baptismal certificate, the full name of this once famous
author was Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer-LytJon, and
in signing some of his early writings be used all these names
with occasional variations in their order, an act which was
regarded by many people as springing from pride and
pompousness, and which elicited the withering satire of
Thackeray in Punch. Lytton was born at London in x8o3,
and his father was a Norfolk squire, Buhver of Heydon
Lytton
Hall; while his mother was Elizabeth Barbara Lytton, a
lady who claimed kinship with Cadwaladr Vendigaid, the
semi-mythical hero who led the Strathclyde Welsh against
the Angles in the seventh century. As a child the future
noveiist was delicate, but he learnt to read at a surprisingly
early age, and began to write verses before he was ten years
old. Going first to a small private school at Fulham, he
soon passed on to another one at Rottingdean ; and here he
continued to manifest literary tastes, Byron and Scott being
his chief idols at this time. So clever was the boy thought,
indeed, that his relations decided it would be a mistake to
send. him to a public school ; and accordingly be was
placed with a tutor at Ealing, under whose care be pro-
gressed rapidly with bis studies. Thereafter he proceeded
to Cambridge, where he took his degree easily. and won
many academic laurels, while on leaving the University
he travelled for a while in Scotland and in France, and then
bought a commission in the army. He so!d it soon after-
wards, however, while in 1827 he was married, and now
he began to devote himself seriously to writing, his first
public'.ltiollS of note being the novels of Falkland, Pelham
and Euge1ze Aram. These won an instant success, and
placed considerable wealth in the author's hands, the result
being that in 1831 he entered parliament as liberal member
for St. lves, Huntingdonshire; and during the next t en
years he was an active policitian yet found time to produce
a host of stories, for instance The Last Days of Pompei and
Ernest J.taltravers, Za111mi and The Last of the Barons.
These were followed shortly by The Caxtons, and simul-
taneously Lytton achieved some fame as a dramatist,
perhaps his best play bein~ The Lady of Lyow;; while in
r8sr he was instrumental 1n founding a scheme for pen-
sioning authors, in 1862 he increased his reputation greatly
by his novel entitled A Strange Story, and four years later
his services to literature and politics were rewarded by a
peerage. He now began to work at yet another story,
Ketzelm Chillitzgly, bu~ his health was beginning to fail, and
he died in 1873 at Torquay.
The works "cited above constitute but a fragment of
Lytum's voluminous achievement. Besides further novels
too numerous to mention, he issued several volumes of
verses notably IsmlUl and The New Union, while hedid trans-
lations from German. Spanish and Italian, he produced a
history of Athens, he contributed to endle.;s periodicals,
and was at one time edilor of The New 111onthJy Maga:ine.
But albeit so busy throughout the whole of his career, and
while winning vast fame and opulence, Lytton's life was
not really a happy one, various causes conducing to make it
otherwise. Long before meeting his wife he fell in love with
a young girl who died prematurely, and this loss seems to
have left an indelible scar on his heart. while his marriage
was anything but a successful one, the pair being divorced
comparatively soon after their union. NoiY as a mere
child, Lytto~t had evinced a predilection for mysticism,
while he had surprised his mother once by asking her
whether she was ••not sometimes overcome by the sense of
her own identity" (almost exactly. the same question was
put to his nurse in boyhood by another mystic, William
Bell Scott) ; Lvlton sedulously developed his leaning
towards the occult, and it is everywhere m?.nifest in his
literary output. It transpires, for example, in his poem
The Tale of a Drcam~r. and again in /(eaelm Chillitzgly,
while in A Slran,~e Story be tries to give a scientific
colouring to old-fashioned ml\giC ; hut neither this essay
nor those others are really to be c:>lled triumphant in the
artistic sense, and, as Sir 1.-eslie Stephen shrewdly observes,
Lytton's " attempts at the mysterious too often remind
us of spirit-rappmg rather than excite the thrill of super-
natural ?-we." In a word Lylloll'> outlook on life was
theatrical and his mysticism was not a little stagey.

with the practice of Satanism and sorcery~harges entirely
without founaation. (See Waite, Devil-Worship in France.)

Macrocosm, The : The whole universe (Greek MaeYos, long,
Kosmos the world (f. "J:l.!icrocosm"). A six-pointed star,
formed of two triangles, and the sacred symbol of Solomon's

Macroprosopus, The : One of the four magical clements in the
Kabala ; and probably representing one of the four simple
elements,-air, water, earth, or fire. Maeroprosopus means
" creator of the great world."
Madre Natura : An old and powerful secret society, of Italy,
who worshipped and idealised nature, and which seems
to have been founded by members of the ancient Italian
priesthood. It had a 1:raditi<m that one of the Popes as
Cardinal de Medici became a member of the fraternity. and
for this there is good documentary evidence. It accepted
the allegorical interpretation which the Neo-Platonists had
placed upon the Pagan creeds during the first ages of
Christianity.
Magi : Priests of ancient Persia, and the cultivators of the
wisdom of Zoroaster. They were institutied by Cyrus
when he founded the new Persian empire, and are supposed
to have been of the Median race. Schlegel says (Philcsophy
of Histcry), " they were not so much a hereditary sacerdotal
caste as an order or association, divided into various and
successive ranks and grades, such as existed in the mysteries
-the grade of apprenticeship-that of mastership-that of
perfect mastership." In short, they were a theosophical
college; and either its professors were indifferently" magi,"
or magician;~, and " wise men " or they were distinguished
into two classes by those names. The1r name pronounced
" Mogh " by the modem Persians, and " :Magh " by the
ancients signified "Wise," and such is the interpretation
of it given by the Greek and Roman writers. Stobreus
expressly calls the. science of the magi, the se~vice of the
gods, so Plato. According to Ennemo&er, " Magiusiah,
1\ladschusie. &ignified the office and knowledge of the
priest, who was called " Mag,'Magius, Magiusi," and after-
wards magi and "Magician." Brucker maintains that
the primitive meanin!l of the word is "fire worshipper,"
"worship of the light," an erroneous opinion. In
the modem Persian the word is " Mog," and '' Mogbed "
signifies high priest. The high priest of the Parsecs at
Surat, even at the present day, is called, " Mobed.'' Others
derive the word from ":Megh," "?.feh-ab" signifying
something which is great and noble, and Zoroaster's
disciples were called "Meghestom." Salverte states that
these ::Mobeds are still named in the Pebivi dialect " Magoi."
They were divided into three classes :-Those who
abstained from 311 animal food ; those who never ate of
the flesh of any tame animals ; and those who made no
scruple to eat any kind of meat. A belief in the transmi-
gration of the soul was the foundation of this abstinence.
They professed the science of divination, and for that
purpose met iogether and consulted in their temples.
They professed to make truth the great object of their
study; for that alone, they ~aid, can make man like God
" whose body resembles light, as his soul or spirit resembles
truth." They condemned all images, and those who said
that the gods are male and female ; they had neither
temples nor zltars, but worshipped the sky, as a represen-
tative of the Deity, on tho tops of mountains ; they also
sacrificed to the sun, moon, earth, fire, water, and winds,
says Herodotus, meaning, no doubt that they adored the
heavenly bodies and the elements. This was probably
before the tim~ of Zoroaster, when the religion of Persia
seems to have resembled that of ancient India. Their
hymns in praise of the Most High exceeded, accoraing to
Dio Chrysostom, the sublimity of anything in Homer or
Hesiod. They exposed their dead bodies to wild beasts.
It is a question " whether the old Persian doctrine and
wisdom or tradition of light did not undergo material
alterations in the hands of 1ts .Median restorer, Zoroaster ;
or whether this doctrine was preserved in all its purity by
the order t)f the magi.'' He then remarks that on them
devolved the important trust of the monarch's education.
which must necessarily have given them great weight and
influence in the state. They were in high credit at the
" Persian gates "-for that was the Oriental name given to
the capital of the empire, and the abode of the prince-and
thE'y took the most active part in all the factions that
encompassed chc throne, .,r that were formed in the vicinity
of the court. In Greece, and even in Egypt, the sacerdotal
fraternities and associations of initiated, formed by the
mysteries, had in general but an indirect, though not
unimportant influence on affairs of state ; but in the
Persian monarchy they acquired a complete political
ascendency. Religion, philosophy, and the sciences were
all in their hands, they were the universal physicians who
healed the sick in body and in spirit, and, in strict con-
sistency with that character, ministered to the state, which
is only the man again in a larger sense. The three grades
of the magi alluded to arc called by Herber the " disciples,"
the " professed," and the " masters.'' They were originally
from Bactria, where they governed a litt.Je state by laws
of their own choice, and by their incorporation in the
Persian empire, they greatly promoted the consolidation
of the conquests of Cyrus. Their fall dates from the reign
of Darius Hfstaspes, about 500 B.C., by whom they were
fiercely persecuted ; this produced an emigration which
extended to Cappadoeia on the one hand, and to India on
the other, but they were still of so much consideration at a
later period, as to provoke the jealousy of Alexander the
Great. (Sec Persia.)
l'Uagia Postbuma : A short treatise on Vampirism puolished
at Olmutz in 1706, and written by Ferdinand de Schertz..
Reviewing it Calmet (q.v.) says in his DissertaJion 011
Vampires : "The author relates a story of a woman that
died in a certain village, after having received all the sacra-
ments, and was buried with the usual ceremonies, in the
Churchyard. About four days after her death, the inhabi-
tants of the village were affrighted with an uncommon noise
and outcry, and saw a spectre, sometimes in the shape of a
dog, and sometimes in that of a man, which appeared to
great multitudes of people, and put them to excessive pain
by squeez.ing their throats, and pressing their breasts,
almost to suffocation. There were several whose bodies
he bruised aU over, and reduced them to the utmost weak·
ness, so that they grew pale, lean, and disfigured. His
fury was sometimes so great as not to spare the very
beasts, for cows were frequently found beat to the earth,
half dead; at other times \vith their tails tied to one
Magic 258 Magie
another, and their hideous !owings sufficiently expressed
the pain they felt. Horses were often found almost
wearied to death, foaming with sweat, and out of breath,
as if they had been running a long and tiresome race; and
these calamities continued for several months."
The author of the treatise examines into the subject in
the capacity of a lawyer, and discuss·es both the matter of
fact and the points of law arising from it. He is clearly of
opinion that if the suspected person was really the author
of these noises, disturbances, and acts of cruelty, the law
will justify the burning of the body, as is practised in the
case of other spectres which COrn!! again and molest the
living. He relates also several stories of apparitions of
this sort, and particularises the mischiefs done by them.
One, among others, is of a herdsman of the village of Blow
near the town of Kadam in Bohemia, who appeared fqr a
considerable lime together, and called upon several persons,
who all died within eight days. At last, the inhabitants of
Blow dug up the herdsman's body, and fixed it in the
ground, with a stake driven through it. The man, even
in this condition, laughed at the people that were em-
ployed about him, and told them they were very obliging
to furnish him with a stick to defend himself from the dogs.
The same night he extricated himself from the stake.
frightened several persons by appearing to them, and
occasioned the death of many more than he had hitherto
done. He was then delivered into the hands of the hang-
man, 'vho put him into a cart, in order to burn him without
the town. As they went along, the carcass shrieked in the
most hideous manner, and threw about its arms and legs,
as if it had been alive, and upon being again run through
with a stake, it gave a loud cry, and a great quantity of
fresh, florid blood issued from the wound. At last the body
was burnt to ashes, and this execution put a final stop to
the spectre's appearing and infesting the village.
The same method has been practised in other places,
where these apparitions have been seen, and upon taking
them out of the ground, their bodies have seemed fresh
and florid, their limbs pliant and ficxible, without any
worms or putrefaction, but not without a great stench.
The author quotes ~everal other writers, who attest what
he relates concerning these spectres, which, be says, still
appear in the mountains of Silcsia and Mora,;a. They arc
seen, it seems, both by day and night, and the things which
formerly belonged to them are ('bserved to stir and change
their place, without any person's being seen to touch them.
And the only remedy in thc!se cases, is to cut off the head,
and burn the body of the persons that are supposed to
appear.
Magic : Short for " magic art," from Greek magein the
science and religion of the priests of Zoroaster ; or, accord-
ing to Sltcat, from Greek meglls, great, thus signifying the
" great " science.
liislory.-The earliest traces of m~.gical practice are
found in the European caves of the middle Pal.colithic Age.
These belong to the last interglacial period of the Plt!istocene
period, which has been named the Aurignacian, after the
cave-dwellers of Aurignac, whose skeletons, attifacts and
drawings link them with the Bushmen of South Africa.
In the cave of Gargas, near Bagneres de Luchon, occur, in
addition to spirited and realistic drawings of animals, numer-
ous imprints of human hands in various stages of mutilation.
Some hands had been first smeared with a sticky substance
and then pressed on the rock ; others had been held in
position to be dusted round with red ochre, or black pig-
ment. Most of the imprinted hands have mutilated
fingers; in some cases the first and second joints of one or
more fingers are wanting ; in others the stumps only of all
fingers rt!main. A close study of the hand imprints makes
it evident that they are not to be regarded as those of
lepers. There can be little doubt that the joints were
removed for a specific purpose, and on this point·there is
general agreement among anthropologists. A clue to th~
mystery is obtained by the magical custom among the
Bushmen of similarly removing finger joints. Mr. G. W.
Stow in his Tlte Nativ~ Raus of South Africa makes refer-
ence to this strange form of sacrifice. He once came int<>
contact with a number of Bushmen who "had all lost the
first joint of the little finger " which had been removed
with a " stone knife " with purpose to ensure a safe
journey to the spirit world. Another writer tells of an old
Bushman woman whose little fingers of both harlds had
been mutilated, three joints in all having been removed.
She explained that each joint had been sacrificed as a
daughter died to express her sorrow. No doubt. however,
there was a deeper meaning in the custom than she cared
to confess. F. Boas in his Report on tile N. W. Tribes of
Canada gives evidence of the custom among these peoples.
When frequent deaths resulted from disease. the Canadian
Indians were wont to sacrifice the joints of their little
fingers so as, they explained, " to cut off the deaths."
Among the Indian 1\•Iadiga~ (Telugu Pariahs) the evil eye
is averted by sacrificers who dip their hands in the blood of
goats or sheep and impress them on either side of a house
door. This custom is not unknown even to Brahmans-.
Impressions of hands arc also occasionally seen on the walls
of Indian Mohammedan mosques. As among the N.W.
Canadian tribes, the hand ceremony is most frequently
practised in India when epidemics make a heavy toll of
lives. The Bushmen also remove finger joints when
stricken with sickness. In Australia. where during initia-
tion ceremonies the young men have teeth knocked out and
bodies scarred, the women of some tribes mutilate tlie
little fingers of daughters -..;th purpose to influence their
future careers. Apparently the finger chopping customs
of Pal:eolithic times had a magical significance. On some
of the paintings in the Aurignacian caves appear symbols
which suggest the slaying with spears and cutting up of
animals. Enigmatical signs are another feature. Of
special interest are the figures of animal-headed demons,
some with hands upraised in the Egyptian attitude of
adoration. and others apparently dancing like the animal-
headed dancing gods of the Bushmen. In the Marsonlas
Pal:eolithic cave there ;:.re semi-human faces of angry
demons with staring eyes and monstrous noses. In the
Spanish Cave at Cogul several figures of women wearing
half-length skirts and shoulder shawls, are represented
dancing round a nude m<\lc. So closely do these females
resemble such as usually appear in Bushmen paintings
that they mi~ht well, but for their location, be credited to
this interestmg people. Religious dances among the
Bushman tribes are associated with marriage, birth and
burial ceremonies ; they are also performed to exorcise
demons in cases of sickness. " Dances are to us what
prayers are to you," an elderly Bushman once informed a
European. \Vhcthcr the cave drawings and wood, bone
and ivory carvings of the 111agdalcnian, or late Pal.eolithic
period at the close of the last ice epoch, are of magical
significance is a problt!m on which there is no general agree-
ment. It is significant to .find, however, that several
carved ornaments bearing animal figures or enigmatical
signs are perforated as if worn as charms. On a piece of
horn fOlmd at Lorthet, ITautcs Pyr~necs, are beautiful
incised drawings of reindeer and salmon, above which appea r
mystical symbols. An ape-like demon carved on bone was
found at ?.las d'Azil: on a reindeer born from Laugerie
Basse a prostrate man with a tail is creeping up on all fours
towards a grazing bison. These are some of the instances
which lend colour to the ,;ew that late Pal~olithic art had
its origin in magical beliefs and practices-that hunters

carved on the handles of wcapqns and implements, or
scratched on cave walls, the images of the animals they
desired to capture-somet1mes with the secured co-opera-
tion of demons, and sometimes with the aid of magical
spells.
Coming to historic times we know that the ancient
Egyptians (See Egypt) possessed a highly-developed magical
system, as did the Babylonians (See ~emltes), and othet'
pristine civilisations. Indeed from these the medi:eval
European system of magic was finally evolved. Greece and
Rome (both of which sec) also possessed distinct national
systems, whlch in some measure were branches of their
religions ; and thus like the Egyptian and Babylonian
were preserves of the priesthood.
Magic in early Eut'ope was, of course, merely an appen-
dage of the various religious systems which obtained
throughout that continent ; and it was these systems
which later generated into witchcraft (q.v.) But upon the
foundation of Christianity, the church soon began to regard
the practice of magic as foreign to the spirit of its religion.
Thus the Thirty-sixth Canon of the <Ecumenical Council
held at Laodicea in 364 A.D. forbids clerks and priests to
become magicians, enchanters, mathematicians or astrolo·
gers. It orders, moreover, that the Church shall expel
from its bosom those who employ ligatures or phylacteries,
because it says phylacteries are the pdsons of the soul. The
Fourth Canon of the Council of Oxia, A.D. 525, prohibited
the consultation of sorcerers, augurs, diviners, and divina-
tions made with wood or breacl : and the Sixtieth Canon
of the Council of Constantinople A.D. 692, excommunicated
for a period ofsix years diviners, and those who had recourse
to them. The prohibition was repcaterl by the Council of
Rome in 721. Tl1e Forty-second Canon of the Council of
Tours in 613 is to the effect that the priests shall teach to
the people the inefficacy of magical practices to t'estore the
health of men or animals, and later Councils practically
endorsed the church's earlier views.
It does not appear, however, that what may be called
" media:val magic " took final and definite shape until
about tlie twelfth century. ~!odelled upon the systems
in vogue among the Byzantines and Moors of Spain, which
wet'e evolved from the Alexa.ndrian system (See Neopla-
tonism), what might be called the " oriental " type of
magic gained footing in Europe, and quite superseded the
earlier and semi-barbarian systems in use among the various
countries of that continent, most of which, as has been
said, were the relics of older pagan practi~e and ritual. To
these relics clung the witch and the wizard and the pro-
fessors of lesser magic ; whereas among the disciples of the
imported system we lind the magician-black and white.-
the necromancer and the sorcerer. The manner in which
the theosophy ami the magic of the East was imported was
probably two-fold ; first, there is good evidence that it
was imported into Europe by persons returning from the
Crusades; and secondly, we know that in matters of
'visaom, Byzantium fell heit' to Alexandria, and that from
Constantinople magic was dissemin<Lted throughout Europe,
along with other sciences. It is not necessary to deal in
the course of this article with the history of witchcraft and
lesser sorcery, as that has already been done in the article
"witchcraft" (q.v.) ; and we wiU confine ourselves strictly
to the history of the higher brancl1eS of magic. But it is
competent to remark that Europe had largely obtained its
pneumotology from the orient through Christianity, from
Jewish and earlySemiticsources; ancl it is an open question
how far eastern demonology coloured that of the Catholic
Church.
Medi<eval magic of the higher type has practically no
landmarks save a series of great names. Its tenets ex-
perienced but little alteration during six centuries. From
the eighth to the thirteenth century, there docs not appear
to have been much persecution of the professors of magic,
but alter that period the opinions of the church underw·ent a
radical change, and the life of the magus was fraught with
considerable rlanger. However, it is pretty clear that he
was not victimised in the same manner as hls lesser brethren,
the sorcerers and wizards ; but we find Paracelsus con-
sistently baited by the medical profession of his day,
Agrippa constantly persecuted, and even mystics like
Bcehme imprisoned and ill-used. It is difficult at thls
distance to estimate the enormous vogue that magic
experienced, whether for good or evil during the middle ages.
Although severely punished, if discovered or if its pro-
fessors became sufficiently notorious to court persecution,
the power it seems to have conferred upon them was eagerly
sought by scores of people-the majority of whom were
quite unfitted for its practice, and clumsily betrayed
themselves into the hands of the authorities. In the
article entitled '' Black Magic," we have outlined
the history of that lesser mdgic known as sorcery or " black
magic," and t here have shown what persecutions overtook
those who practised it.
As has already been mentioned, the history of higher
magic in Europe is a matter of great names, aod these are
somewhat· few. They do not include alchemists, who
are strictly speaking not magicians, as their application of
arcane laws was particular and not universal; but this is
not to say that some alchemists were not also magicians.
The two great names which stand out in the history of
European magic are those of Paracelsus and Agrippa, who
formulated the science of medileval magic in its
entirety. They were also the greatest pmctical magicians
of the middle ages, as apart from pure mystics, alchemists
and others, and their thaumaturgic and necromantic ex-
periences were probably never surpassed. With these
medi.eval magic comes to a close and the further history of
the science in Europe will be found outlined in the division
of this article entitled "Modern Magic."
Scientific Theories regarding the Nature of Magic.-
General agreement as to the proper definition of magic is
wanting, as it depends upon the view taken of religious
belief. According to Frazer, magic and religion are one and
the same thlng, or are so closely allied as to be almost
identical. This may be true of peoples in a savage or
barbarian condition of society, but can scarcely apply to
111agic and religion as fully fledged, as for example in medi:e-
val times, however fundamental may be their original unity.
The objective theory of magic would regard it as entirely
distinct from religion, possessed of certain well-marked
attributes, and traceable to mental processes differing from
those from which the religious idea springs. Here and
there the two have become fused by the super-imposition of
religions upon magical practice. The objective irlea of
magic, in short, rests on the belief t hat it is based on
magical laws which are supposed to operate with the
regularity of those of natural science. The subjective
view, on the other hand, is that many practices seemingly
magical are in reality religious, and that no rite can be
called rnagica.l which is not so designated by its celebrant
or agent. It has been said that religion consists of an
appeal to the gods, whet'eas magic is the attempt to force
t heir compliance. l\fessrs. Hubert and Mauss believe that
magic is essentially traditional. Holding as they do that
the primitive mind is markedly unorigioal, they have
satisfied themselves that magic is therefore an art which
does not exhibit any frequent changes amongst primitive
folk, and is fixed by its laws. Religion, they say, is official
and organised, magic prohibited and secret. Magical power
appears to tbem to be determined by the contiguity, simi·
larity and contrast of the object of the act, and the object
Magic 260 Magic
to be effected. :\llr. Frazer believes all m~gic to be based
on the law of sym!)atby-that is the assumption that
thlngs act on one another at a distance because of their
being secretly linked to~ether by invisible bonds. He
divides sympathetic 'nagic into homeopathic magic and
conta~ious magic. The first is imitative or mimetic, and
m:~.y be practised by itself; but the latter usually necessi-
tates the application of the imitative principle. Well-
known instances of mimetic magi.: are the forming of wax
figures in the likene:;s of an enemy, which are destroyed in
the hope that he will perish. Contagious magic may be
instanced by the sava~e anointin~t the weapon which caused
a. wound instead of the wound itself, in the belief that the
blood on the weapon contil)ues to feel with the blood on
the body. Mr. L. l\farillier divides t~~agic into three classes:
the tn~gic of the word or act ; the magic of the human being
independent of rite or formula ; and the magic which
dem'lnds a hum:~.n being of special powers and the use of
ritual. Mr. A. Lehmann believes magic to be a practice of
superstition, and founds it in illusion. The fault of all
these theories is that they strive after too great an exact-
ness, and that they do not allow sufficiently for the feeling
of wonder and awe which is native to the human mind.
Indeed they designate this "strained attention." We
m:J.y grant that the attention of savages to a magical rite
is " strained," so strained is it in some case$ that it terrifies
them into insanity; and it would seem therefore as if the
limits of" attention" were overpassed. and as if it shaded
into somethin~ very much deeper. ll1oreover it is just
possible that m future it may be granted that so-called
sympathetic magic does not partake of the nature of magic
at all, but has greater affinities (owing to its strictly
natural and non-supernatural character) with pseudo-
science.
Magic is recognised by m'lny savage peoples as a force
rather than an art,-a thing which impinges upon the
thought of man from outside. It would appear that many
barbarian tribes believe in what would seem to be a great
reservoir of magical power, the exact nature of which they
are not prepared to specify. Thus amongst certain Ameri-
can-Indtan tribes we find a force called Orenda. or spirit-
force. Amongst the ancient P.eruvians, everything sacred
was huaca and possessed of magical power. In Melanesia,
,.,.e find a force spoken of called' mana, transmissible and
contagious, which may be seen in the form of flames or
even heard. The l'flalays use the word kramaJ to signify
the same thing ; and the Malagasy the term hasma. Some
of the tribes round Lake Tanganyika believe in such a
force, which they calltzgai, and Australian tribes have many
similar terms, such as churinga and boolya. To hark back
to America, we find in MeXlco the strange creed named
na$uatistn, which partakes of the same conception-every-
thtng nagual is magical or possesses an inherent spiritual
force of its own.
Theories of the Origin of M aqic.-Many theories have
been advanced regarding the origm of magic-some author-
ities believing that it commenced with the idea of personal
superiority ; others through animistic beliefs (See Animism);
and still others through such ideas as that physical pains,
for which the savage could not ..account, were supposed
to be inflicted by invisible weapons. This last theory is, of
course, in itself, merely animistic. It does not seem, how-
ever, that writers on the subject have given sufficient
attention to the great influence exerted on the mind of man
by odd or peculiar occurrences. We do not for a moment
de~ire to advance the hypothesis that magic entirely
o:i:;inated from such a source, but we believe that it was
a powerful factor in the growth of magical belief. To
which, t.)o, animt~rn and taboo contributed their quota.
The cult of the dead too and their worship would soon
become fused with magical practice, and a complete
demonology would thus speedily arise.
The Dynamics of Magrc.-l\!a)l'ica1 practice is governed
by well-muked laws limited in number. It possesses
many classes of practitioner ; as, for example, the diviner
or augur, whose duties are entirely different from those
of the witch-doctor. Chief among these laws, as has been
already hinted, is that of sympathy, which, as has been
said, must inevitably be sub-divided into the taws of
similarity, contiguity and antipathy. The law of simi-
larity and homeopathy is again divisible into two sections :
{I)-the assumption that like produces like-an illustration
of which is the destruction of a model in the form of an
enemy; and (2)-the idea that like cures like-for instance,
that the stone called the bloodstone can staunch the flow
of bleeding. The law dealing with antipathy rests on
the assumption that the application of a certain object
or dru~ expels its contrary. There remains contiguity,
which IS based on the concept that whatever has once
formed part of an object continues to form part of it.
Thus if a magician can obtain a portion of a person's hair,
he can work woe upon him through the invisible bonds
which are supposed to extend between him and the hair in
the sorcerer's possession. It is well-known that if the
animal familiar of a witch be wounded, that the wound will
react in a sympathetic manner on the witch herself. This
is called " repercussion."
Another widespread belief is that if the magician procures
the name of a person that he can gain magical dominion
over him. This, of course, arose from the idea that the
name of an individual was identical with himself. The
doctrine of the Incommunicable Name, the hidden name
of the god or magician, is well instanced by many legends
in Egyptian history,-the deity usually taking extra-
ordinary care to keep his name secret, in order that no one
might gain power over him. :rbe spell or incantation is
connected with this concept, and with these, in a lesser
degree, may be associated magical gesture, which is usually
introduced for the purpose of accentuating the spoken word.
Gesture is often symbolic or sympathetic ; it is sometimes
the. reversal of a religious rite, such as marc)).ing against
the sun, which is known as walking "widdershins." The
method of pronouncing rites is, too, one of great impor-
tance. Archaic or foreign expressio!ls are usually found
in spells ancient and modem ; and the tone in which the
incantation is spoken, no less than its exactne~s. is also
important. To secure exactness rhythm was often em-
ployed, which bad the effect of aiding memory.
The Magician.-In early society, the magician, which
term includes the shaman, medicine-man, piage, witch-
doctor, et cetera, may bold his position by hereditary
right ; by an accident of birth, as being the seventh son
of a seventh son ; to revelation from the gods ; or through
mere mastery of ritual. In savage life we find the shaman
a good deal of a medium, for instead of summoning the
powers of the air at his biddin~ as did the magicians of
medireval days, he seems to find tt necessary to throw him·
self into a state of trance and seek them in their own
sphere. The magician is also often regarded as possessed
by an animal or supernatural being. The duties of the
priest and magician are often combined in primitive
society, but it cannot be too strongly asserted that where
a religion has been superseded, the priests of the old
cult are, for those who have taken their places, nothing
but magicians. We do not hear much of beneficent magic
among savage peoples, ;md it is only in Europe that \'Vhite
Magic may be said to have gained any hold.
MeditZUal Definition of Magic.-Tbe definitions of magic
vouchsafed by the great magicians of medireval and modem
times naturally differ greatly from those of anthropologists.
Magie 261 Magie?.l Diagrams
For example Eliphas Levi Sa)·s in his History of
Magic: "Magic combines in a smgle science that which
is most certain in philosophy with that which is eternal
and infallible in religion. It reconciles perfectly and
incontestably those two terms so opposed on the first
view-faith and reason, science and beli~f. authori(y and
li~. It furnishes the human mind with an instrument
of phtlosophical and religious certainty, as exact as mathe-
matics, and even accounting for the infallibility of mathe-
matics themselves. . . . . . There is an incontestable truth,
and there is an infallible method of knowing that truth ;
while those '~ho attain this knowledge and adopt it as a
rule of life, can endow their life with a sovereign power,
which can make them masters of all inferior things, of
wandering spirits, or in other words, arbiters and kings of
the world." Paracelsus says regarding magic : " The
magical is a ~reat hidden wisdom, and reason is a great
open folly. :No armour shields against magic for it strikes
at the inward spirit of life. Of this we may rest assured,
that thmugh full and power(ul imagination only can we
bring the spirit of any man into an image. No conjuration,
no rites are needful ; circle-making and the scattering of
incense arc mere humbug and jugglery. The human spirit
is so great a thing that no man can express it ; eternal and
unchangeable as God Himself is the mind of man ; ar.d
could we rightly comprehend the mind of man, nothing
would be impossible to us upon the earth. Through faith
the imagination is invigorated and completed, for it really
happens that every doubt mars its perfection. Faith must
strengthen imagination, for faith establishes the wilL
Because man did not perfectly believe and imagine, the
result is that arts are uncertain when they might be wholly
certain." Agrippa also regarded magic as the t rue road to
communion with God-thus linking it with mysticism.
Modemlv!agic: With the death of Agrippa in 1535 the old
school of magicians may be said to have ended. But that is
not to say that the traditions of magic were not handed on
to others who were equally capable of preserving them.
\Ve must carefully discriminate at this juncture between
those practitioners of magic whose minds were illuminated
by a high mystical ideal, ar.d persons of doubtful occult
position, like the Comte de Saint-Germain and others. At
the beginning of the seventeenth century we fir.d many
great alchemists in practice, who were also devoted to
the researches of transcendental magic, which they care-
fully and successfully concealed under the veil of hermetic
experiment. 1'hese were i\lichael Meyer, Campe, Robert
Flood, Co~mopolite, D'Espagnet, Samuel Norton, Baron
de Beausoleil, and Van Helmont ; another illustrious name
ia also that of Philalethes. The eighteenth century was
rich in occult personalities, as for example the alchemist
Lascaris (q.v.) Martines de Pasqually, and Louis de Saint-
Martin (q.v.) who founded the Martinist school, which
still exists under the grandmastership of Papus. After
this magic merges for the moment into mesmerism, and
many of the secret magical societies which aboun.ded in
Europe about this period practised animal magnetism as
well as astrology, Kabalism and ceremonial magic. Indeed
mesmeri~m powerfully inftu4:nced mystic life in the time of
its chief protagQ~1ist. and the mesmerists of the fint era are
in direct line with the l\iartinist and the mystical magicians
of the late eighteenth century. Indeed mysticism and
magnetism are one and the same thing, in the persons of
some of these occultists (Setr Secret Tradition) the most
celebrated of which were Cazotte, Ganneau, Comte,
\Vronski, Du Potct, Heunequin, Comte d'Ourches, and
Baron de Guidenstub!>t, and last of the initiates known to
us, Eliphas Levi (all of which see).
That Black Magic and sorcery are still practised is a
well-known fact, which requires no amplification in this
place (See J:evil VlorshJp) : but what of that higher magic
which has, at least in modern times, attracted so many
gifted minds ? We cannot say that the true line of
magical adepts ended v:ith Levi, as at no time in the world's
history are these known to the vulgar ; but we may be
certain that the great art is practised in secret as sedulously
as ever in the past, and tt.at men of temperament ;;.s
exalted as in the case of the magacian~ of older days still
privately pursue that art, which, like its sister religion, .is
none the less celestial because it h:..s been evolved from
lowly origins in the mind of man, whose spirit with the
march of time reflects ever more strongly the light of
heaven, as the sea at first dimly reddened by the dawn, at
length mirrors the whole splendour of day.

ments, Medireval Magic.)
Magic Darts : The Laplanders, who passed at one time for
great magicians, were said to launch lead darts, about a
finger-length, against their absent enemies, believing that
with the magic darts they were sending grevious pains and
maladies. (See .Magic.)
Magic Squares : (See Abraham the Jew.)
Magical Diagrams : These were geometrical designs, repre-
senting the mysteries of deity and creation, therefore
·supposed to be of special virtue in rites of evocation and
conjuration.
The chief of these were the Triangle, the Double Triangle,
forming a six-pointed star and known as the Sign or Seal
of Solomon ; the Tetragram a four-pointed star formed
by the interlacement of two pillars ; and the Pentagram,
a fwe-pointed star.
These signs were traced on paper or parchment, or
engraved on metals and glass and consecrated to thl'ir
various uses by special rites.
The Triangle was based on the idea of trinity as found in
all things, in deity, time and creation. The triangle was
generally traced on the ground v.-ith the magic sword or
rod, as in circles of evocation where the triangle was drawn
within it and according to the position of the magicia"n at
its point or base so the spirits were conjured from heaven or
hell.
The Double Triangle, the Sign of Solomon, symbolic of
the Macrocosm, was formed by the interlacement of two
triangles, thus its points constituted the perfect number
six. The magicians wore it, bound on their brows and
breasts during the cetemonies and it was engraved on the
silver reservoir of the magic lamp.
The Tetragram was symbolic of the four elements and
used in the conjuration of the elementary spirits-sylphs
of the air, undines of the water, the fire salamanders and
gnomes of the earth. lJl alchemy it represented the
magical elements, salt, sulphur, mercury and azoth; in
mystic philosophy the ideas Spirit, Matter, Motion and
Rest ; in hieroglyphs the man, eagle, lion and bull.
1he Pentagram, the sign of the Microcosm, was held to be
the most powerful means of conjuration in any rite. It
may represent evil as "'ell as good, for while with one point
in the ascendant it was the sign of Christ, with two points
in the ascendant it was the sign of Satan. By the usc of
the pentagram in these positions the powers of light or
darkness were evoked. The pentagram was said to be
the star which led the Magi to the manger where the
infant Christ was laid.
1he p~eparation and consecration of this sign for use in
magical rites is prescribed with great detail. lt might be
composed of seven metals, the ideal form for its expression ;
or traced in pure go!d upon white marble, never before
used for any purpose. It might also be drawn with
Magical Instrum'.lnts ani Accessories 262 Magical Numbers
vermilion upon lambsldn without a blemish prepared under
the auspice' of the Sun. The si~n was next consecrated
with the four elements ; breathed on five times ; dried by
the smoke of five perfum~s. incense, myrrh, aloes, sulphur
and camphor. The names of five genii were breathed
above it, and then the sign wa.s placed successively at the
north, south, east and west and centre of the astronomical
cross pronouncing the letters of the sacred tetragram and
various Kabalistic names.
It W.lS believed to be of great efficacy in terrifying
ph:lntoms if engraved upon glass, and the m"lgicians
traced it on their doorsteps to prevent evil spirits from
entering and the good from departing.
This symbol bas been used by all secret and occult
societies, by the Rosicrucians, the Illuminati, down to the
Freemasons of to-day. Modem Occultists translate the
meaning of the pentagram as symbolic of the human soul
and its relation to God.
The symbol is placed with one point in the ascendant.
That point represents the Great Spirit, God. A line drawn
from there to the left-hand angle at base is the descent
of spirit into matter in its lowest form, whence it ascends
to nght-hand angle typifying m;~.ttcr in its highest form,
the brain of m:1n. From here a line is drawn across the
figure to left angle representing man's development in
intellect, and progress in material civilization, the point of
danger, from which all nations have fallen into moral
corruption, signified by the descent of the line to right
angle at base. But the soul of man being derived from
God cannot remain at this point, but must struggle upward,
as is symbolised by the line reaching again to the apex,
God, whence it issued.
Magical Instruments and Accessories : In tnagical rites these
were considered of the utmo~t importance. Indispensable
to the efti.cacy of the ceremonies were the altar, the chalice,
the tripod, the censer; the lamp, rod, sword, and magic
fork or trident; the sacred fire and consecrated oils ; the
incense and the candles.
The altar. might be of wood or stone, but if of the latter,
then of stone that has never been worked or hewn or even
tO\.ched by the hammer.
1he chalice might be of different metals, symbolic of the
object of the rites. Where the purpose was evil, a black
chalice WM used as in the profane masses of sorcerers and
witches. In some talismans the chalice is engraved as a
symbol of the moon.
The tripod and its triangular stand was also made in
symbolic metals.
The censer might be of bronze, but preferably of silver.
In the construction of the lamp, gold, silver, brass and
iron must be used, iron for the pedestal, brass for the
m~rror, silver _for the reservoir and at the apex a golden
tnangle. Vanous symbols were traced upon it, including an
androgynous figure about the pedestal, a serpentdevouring
its own tail, and the Sign of Solomon.
The rod must be specially fashioned of certain woods
and then consecrated to its m:lgical uses. A perfectly
straight branch of almond or hazel was to be chosen. This
'~a~ c~t before the tree blossomed, and cut with a golden
stckle m the early dawn. Throughout its length must be
run a long needle of magnetized iron ; at one end there
should be affixed a triangular prism, to the other, one of
black resin, and rings of copper and zinc bound about it.
At the new moon it must be consecrated by a magician
who already possesses a consecrated rod.
The secret of the construction and consecration of
magicaJ rods was jealously guarded by all magicians and
the rod itself was displayed as little as possible, being
usually concealed in the flowing sleeve of the magician's
robe.
The sword must be wrought of unalloyed steel, with
copper handle in the form of a crucifix. Mystical signs
were engraved on guard and blade and its consecration
took place on a Sunday in full rays of the sun, when the
sword was thrust into a sacred fire of cypress and laurel,
then moistened with the blood of a snake, polished, and
next, together \vith branches of vervain, swathed in silk.
The sword w<ts generally used in the service of Black ~Iagic.
The magic fork or trident used in necromancy was also
fashioned of hazel or almond, cut from the tree at one
blow with an unused knife, from whose blade must be
fashioned the three prongs. Witches and sorceresses are
usually depicted using the trident in their infernal rites.
The fire was lit with charcoal on which were cast branches
of trees, symbolic of the end desired. In Black Magic
these generally consisted of cypress, alderwood, broken
crucifixes and desecrated hosts.
The oil for anointing was compounded of myrrh, cinna-
mon, galingale and purest oil of Olive. Unguents were
used by sorcerers and witches, who smeared their brows,
breasts and wrists with a mixture composed of human fat
and blood of corpses, combined with aconite, belladonna
and poisonous fungi, thinking thereby to make themselves
invisible.
Incense might be of any odorifer• us woods and herbs,
such as cedar, rose, citron, aloes, cinnamon, sandal, reduced
to a fine ~wder, together with incense and storax. In
Black Magtc, alum, sulphur and assafcetida were used as
incense.
The candles, belonging solely to practices of Black Magic
were moulded from human fat and set in candlesticks of
ebony carved in the form of a crescent.
Bowls also were used in these ceremonies, fashioned of
different metals, their shape symbolic of the heavens. In
necromantic rites skulls of cnminals were used, generally
to hold the blood of some victim or sacrifice.
Magical Numbers : Certain t~umbus and their combinations
were held to be of magical power, by virtue of their repre-
sentation of divine and creative mysteries.
The doctrines of Pythagoras furnished the basis for much
of this belief. According to his theory numbers contained
the elements of all things, of the natural and spiritual
worlds and of the sciences. The real numerals of the
universe are the primaries one to ten and in their com-
bination the reason of all else may be found. To the
Pytbagoreans One represented unity, therefore God; Two
was duality, the Devil ; Four wa!' sacred and holy, the
number on which they swore their most solemn oaths ;
Five was their symbol of marriage. They also attributed
certain 11umbers to the gods, planets and elements ; one
represented the Sun, two the Moon ; while five was fire.
six the earth, eight the air, and twelve water.
Cornelius Agrippa in his work Occult Philosophy pub·
lished in 1533, discourses upon numbers as those characters
by whose proportion all things were formed. He enu-
merates the virtues of numerals as displayed in nature,
instancing the herb cinquefoil, which by the power of the
number five exorcises devils, allays fever and forms an
antidote to poisons. Also the virtue of seven as in the
power of the seventh son to cure king's ~vii.
One was the origin and common measure of all things.
It is indivisible ; not to be multiplied. In the universe
there is one God ; one supreme intelligence in the intellec-
tual world, man ; in the sidereal world, one Sun ; one
potent instrument and agency in the elementary world,
·the philosopher's stone; one chief member in the human
world, the heart ; and one sovereign prince in the nether
world, Lucifer.
Two was the number of marriage, charity and social
communion. It was also regarded sometimes as an unclean
Magical Papyri 263 Maginot
number; beasts of the field went into the Ark by twos.
Three had a mysterious value as shown in Time's trinity
-Past, Present and Future ; in that of Space-length,
breadth and thickness: in the three heavenly virtues-
faith, hope and charity ; in the three worlds of man-
brain, the intellectual ; heart, the celestial ; and body,
elemental.
Four signifies solidity and foandation. There arc four
seasons, four clements, four cardinal points, four evangelists.
Five, as it divides ten, the sum of all mm:bers, is also the
number of justice. There are five senses; the Stigmata,
the wounds of Christ were five; the name of the Deity the
Pentagram is composed of five letters ; it also is a pro-
tection against beasts of prey.
Six is the sign of creation, because the world was com-
pleted in six days. It is the perfect number, because it
alone by addition of its half, its third and its sixth reforms
:itself. It also represents servitude by reason of the Divine
injunction ·• Six days shalt thou labour."
Seven is a miraculous number, consisting of one, unity,
and six, sign of perfection. Tt represents life because it
~ontains body, consisting of four elements, spirit, flesh,
bone and humour ; and soul, made up of three elements,
passion, desire and reason. The seventh day was that on
which God rested from his work of creat-ion.
Eight represents justice and fulncss. Divided. its halves
are equal ; twice divided, it is still even. In the Beatitude
eight is the number of those mentioned-peace-makers,
they who strive after righteousness, the meek, the perse-
cuted, the pure, the merciful, the poor in spirit, and they
that mourn.
Nine is tl1e number of the muses and of the moving
spheres.
Ten is completeness because one cannot count beyond
it except by combinations formed with other mm:bers. In
the ancient mysteries ten days of initiation were pre-
scribed. In ten is found evidentsigns of a Divine principle.
Eleven is the number of the commandments, while
Twelve is the number of signs in tlle Zodiac, of tlle apostles,
of the tribes of Israel, of the gates of Jerusalem.
This theory of mm:bers Agrippa applied to the casting
of horoscopes. Divination by nrm:bers was one of the
favourite methods employed in the Middle Ages.
In magical lites, t~ulllbtrs played a great part. The
instruments, vestments and ornaments must be duplicated.
The power of the number three is found in the magic triangle:
in the three prongs of the trident and fork ; and in the three-
fold repetition of names in conjurations. Seven was also
of great influence, the seven days of the week each repre-
senting the period most suitable for certain evocations and
these corresponded to the seven magical works ; I .-works
of light and riches ; 2.-works of divination and mystery;
3.-works of skill, science and eloquence ; 4.-works of
wrath and chastisement ; s.-works of love ; 6.-works
of ambition and intrigue ; 7.-works of malediction and
death.
Magical Papyri : (Sec Egypt.)
Magical Union of Cologne : A society stated in a MS. of the
~osicrucians at Colog11c to have been founded in that city
ID the· year 1 I I5. In the Rosmkreutzer i" .seiner blosse of
Weise it is stated t.hat the initiates wore a triangle as
symbolising power, wisdom and love. The more exalted
orders among them were called ~lagos, and these held the
greater mysteries of the fraternity.
Magical Vestments an:! Appurtenances : Thesewere prescribed
needful adjuncts to magical rites, whose colour, name, form
and substance, symbolic of certain powers and clements,
added, it was supposed, greater efficacy to the evocations.
~braham th!! Jew, a ~agici~n of the Middle Ages, pre-
scnbed a turuc of whtte hnen, with upper robe of
scarlet and girdle of white silk. A crown or fiUet of silk
and gold was to be worn on the head and the perfumes
cast on the fire might be incense, aloes, storax, cedar,
citron or rose.
According to other authorities on the subject it was
advisable to vary colour of robe and employ certain jewels
and other accessories according to the symbolism of the
end desired. A magician of the nineteenth century,
Eliphas Levi, gives a detailed description of ritual, from
which the following is taken.
If the rites were those of White Magic and performed on
a Sunday, then the vestment should be of purple, the tiara,
bracelets and ring of gold, the latter set with a chrysolith
or ruby. Laurel, heliotrope and sunflowers are the sym-
bolic flowers, while other details include a carpet of lion-
skins and fans of sparrow-hawk feathers. The appropriate
perfumes are incense, saffron, cinnamon and red sandal.
If, however, the ceremonial took place on a Monday, the
Day of the 1\loon, then the robe must be of white embroi-
dered with silver and the tiara of yellow silk emblazoned
with silver characters ; while the wreaths were to be woven
of moonwort and yellow ranunculi. The jewels appro-
priate to the occasion were pearls, crystals and selenite ;
the perfumes, camphor, amber. aloes, wl1ite sandal and
seed of cucumber.
In evocations concerning transcendent knowledge, green
was the colour chosen for the vestment, or it might be
green shot with various colours. The chief ornament was
a necklace of pearls and hollow glass beads enclosing mer·
cury. Agate was the symbolic jewel ; narcissus, lily,
herb mercury, fumitory, and marjoram the flowers; whilst
the perfumes must be benzoin, mace and storax.
For operations connected with religious and political
matters, the magician must don a robe of scarlet and bind
on his brow a brass tablet inscribed with various characters.
His ring must be studded with an emerald or sapphire, and
be must burn for incense, balm, ambergris, grain of para-
dise and saffron. For garlands and wreaths, oak, poplar,
fig and pomegranate leaves should be entwined.
If the ceremonial dealt with amatory affairs, the vestment
must be of sky-blue, the ornaments of copper, and the
crown of violets. The magic ring must be set with a
turquoise, while the tiara and clasps were wrought of
lapis-lazuli and beryl. Roses. myrtle and olive were the
symbolic flowers, and fans must be made of swan-
feathers.
If vengeance was desired on anyone, then robes must be
worn whose colour was that of blood, flame or rust, belted
with steel, with bracelets and ring of the same metal. The
tiara must be bound with gold and the wreaths woven of
absinthe and rue.
To bring misfortune and death on a person, the vest-
ment must be black and the neck encircled with lead. The
ring must be set with an onyx and the garlands twined of
cypress, ash and hellebore ; whilst the perfumes to be used
were sulphur, scammony, alum and assafa:tida.
For purposes of Black Magic, a seamless and sleeYeless
robe of black \Vas donned, while on the head was worn a
le.:<den cap inscribed with the signs of the 111oon, Venus and
Saturn. The wreaths were of vervain and cypress; and
the perfumes burned were aloes, camphor and storax.
Maginot, Adele : One of the mediums whose trance utterances
have been recorded by the French spiritualist Alphonse
Cahagnet, who published his Arcanes de ta vie future
devoilt!s in I848. Her stances, of which Cahagnet strove
to obtain a written account from as many as possible of
those present, are among the most valuable evidence wbich
spiritualism can produce. Her descriptions of absent or
deceased friends of the sitters were singularly accurate,
though her supposed conversations with their spirits would

appear to be fictitious. At the least her seances are excel-
lent examples of telepathic communication.

Maier, Michael : A German alchemist born at Rindsburg in
Holstein about the year 1858. He was one of the principal
figures in the Rosicrucian Controversy in Germany and the
greatest adept of his time. He diligently pursued the
study of medicine in his youth and settling at Rostock
practised with such success that the Emperor Rudolph
appointed him as his physician, ennobling him later for his
services. Some adepts eventually succeeded iii luring him
from the practical work he followed so long into the mazy
and tortuous paths of alchemy. In order to confer with
those whom he suspected were possessed of the transcen-
dent mysteries he travelled all over Germany. The
Biographie Universell~ states that in pursuit of these
'' ruinous absurdities " he sacrificed his health, fortune and
time. On a visit to England he became acquainted with
Robert Fludd the Kentish Mystic.
In the controversy which convulsea Germany on the
appearance of his Rosicrucian 1\'Ianifestoes, he t.ook a
VIgorous and enthusiastic share and wrote several works
in defence of the mysterious society. He is alleged to have
travelled in order to seek for members of the " College of
Teutonic Philosophers R.C.," and failing to find them formed
a brotherhood of his own, based on the form of the Fama
F1'aternibtls. There is no adequate authority for this
statement, but it is believed that he eventually, towards
the end of his life, was initiated into the genuine o::der.
A posthumous pamphlet of Maier's called Ulysses was pub-
lished by one of his personal friends in 1624. There was
added to the same volume the substance of two pamphlets
already published in German but which in view of their
importance were now translated into Latin for the benefit
of the European literati. The first pamphlet was entitled
Colloquium Rhodoslat~roticum trium persotJarium per
Famem et Confessionem quodamodo revelatam de Frater-
nitaJe RostZ Crucis. The second was an Echo Colloquii by
Hilarion on behalf of the Rosicrucian Fraternity. From
these pamphlets it appears that Maier was admitted as a
member of the mystical order. He became the most pro-
fuse writer on alchemy of his time. He died in the year
1622. Most of his works, many of which are adorned with
curious plates~ are obscure with the exception of his Rosi-
crucian Apologies. (See Rosicrucians.)
M&lmonldes, Moses {It35-1204) : A great Spanish-Hebrew
philosopher and theologian, the author of the Guide of the
Perple~ed. His theories are Aristotelian and rational, but
there remained in his view-point a touch of mysticism.
Malachite : Used to preserve the cradle of an infant from
spells.
Malays : Magic among the Malays is for the most part of
that type known as" sympathetic" (See Magic), that is, it
po~sesses more of the nature of pseudo-science than that
of wonder. Says Clifford:-
" The accredited intermediary between men and spirits
is the Pawang; the Pawang is a functionary of great and
traditional importance in a Malay village, though in places
near towns the office is falling into abeyance. In the
inland districts, however, the Pawang is still a power, and
is regarded as part of the constituted order of Society,
without whom no village community would be complete.
lt must be clearly understood that he had nothing what-
ever to do with the official Muhammadan religion of t.'le
mosque ; the village has its regular .staff of elders-the
Imam, Khatio, and Bilal-for the mosque service. But
the Pawang is quite outside this system and belongs to a
different and much older order of ideas ; he may be re-
garded as the legitimate representative of the primitiYe
' medicine-man,' or ' village-sorcerer,' and his very existence
in these days is an anomaly, though it does not strike-
Malays as such.....
"Tile Pawang is a person of very real significance. In alL
agricultural operations, such as sov.ing, reaping. irri~ation
works, and the clearing of jungle for planting, in fishing at
sea, in prospecting for minerals, and in cases of sickness,
his assistance is invoked. He is entitled by custom to-
certain small fees; thus, after a good harvest he is allowed
in some villages five gantangs of padi, one gantang of rice
(b5ras), and two ckupaks of emping (a preparation of rice·
and cocoa-nut made into a sort of sweetmeat) from each
householder."
The Pawang regulates tabc..os, and employs a familiar
spirit known as kantu Pttsaka-a hereditary demon. He
also acts as a medium and divines through trance. To-
become a magician "Yo.u must meet the ghost of a mur-
dered man. Take the midrib of a leaf of the ' ivory '
coeoa-nut palm (Pelepak niyor gading). which is to be laid
on the grave, and two midribs, which are intended to
represent canoe-paddles, and carry them with the help of a.
companion to the grave of the murdered man at the time
of the full moon (the 15th day of the lunar month) when il
falls upon a Tuesday. Then take a cent's worth of incense.
with glowing· embers in a censer, and carry them to the
head-post of the g1·avc of the deceased. Fumigate the
grave, going three times round it, and call upon the mur-
dered man by name :-
' Hearken, So-and-so,
And assist me ; .
I am taking (this boat) to the saints of God,
And I desire to ask for a little magic.'
Here take the first midrib, fumigate it, and lay it upon the
head of the grave, repeating' Kur Allah' ('Cluck, Cluck.
God!') seven times. You and your companion must
now take up a sitting posture, one at the head and the-
other .at the foot of the grave, facing the grave post, and
use the canoe-paddles which you have brought. In a
little while the surrounding scenery will change and take
upon itself the appearance of the sea. and finally an aged
man will appear, to whom you must address the same
request as before.''
Malay magic may be sub-divided into pre:paratory rites,
sacrificial, lustration, divination and posseSSlon. Sacrifice
takes the form of a simple gift, or aCf of homage to the
spirit or deity. Lustration is magico-religious and puri-
ficatory, principally taking place after child-birth. It may
be performed by fire or water. Divination consists for the-
most part o{ the reading of dreams, and is, as elsewhere.
drawn from the acts of men or nature. Omens are strongly
believed in.
'' When a star is seen in apparent proximity to the moon.
old people say there will be a wedding shortly ....
'' The entrance into a house of an animal which does not
generally seek to share the abode of man is regarded by
the 1.1falays as ominous of misfortune. If a wild bird dies.
into a house it must-be carefully caught and smeared with
oil, and must then be released in the open air, a fQrmula.
being recited in which it is bidden to fly away with all the·
ill-luck and misfortunes (sial jambalang) of the occupier.
An iguana, a tortoise. and a snake, are perhaps the most
dreaded_of these unnatural visitors. They are sprinkle<i
with ashes, if possible to counteract their evil influence.
Malays 265 1\Talleus
'' A swarm of bees settling near a house is an unlucky
omen, and prognostic~tes misfortune."
So. too, omens are taken either from the flight or·cries of
certain birds, such as the night-owl, the crow, some kinds
of wild doves, and the bird called the " Rice's Husband "
(laki padi.)
Astrology.-Divination by astrology is, however, the
most common method of forecasting the future. The
native practitioners poosess long tables of lucky and unlucky
periods and reasons. These are mostly translations from
Indian and Arabic sources. The oldest known of these
systems of propitious and unpropitious seasons is known
as Katika Lima, or the Five Times. Under it the day is
divided into five parts, and five days form a cycle. To
each division is given a name as follows . Maswara, Kala,
S'ri, Brahma, Bisnu (Vishnu) names of Hindu deities, the
last name in the series for the first day being the first in
that of the second day, and so on until the five days are
exhausted. Each of these has. a colour, and according
to the colour first seen or noticed on such and such a day
will it be fortunate to ask a boon of a certain god. Another
version of this system, known as the " Five Moments " is
similar in origin, but possesses a Mohammedan nomencla-
ture. Another scheme Katika T~tjoh is based on the seven
heavenly bodies, divides each day into seven parts, each of
which is distinguished by the Arabic name for the sun,
moon, and principal planets. The astrology proper of the
Malays is purely Arabic in origin, but a system of Hindu
invocation is in vogue by which the lunar month is divided
into parts called Rejang, which resembles the NacshaJms
or lunar houses of the Hindus. Each division has its
symbol, usually an animal. Each day is propitious for
something. and the whole system bas been committed to
verse for mnemonic purposes.
Demonology.-The demoniac form common to Malaysia
is that of the Jinn, with some leaven of the older Hindu
spirit. They are one hundred and ninety in number. They
are sometimes sub-divided into" faithful" and ·• infidel,"
andfurther into the Jinns of the royal musical instruments,
of the state, and of the royal weapons. The Afrit is also
known. Angels also abound, and are purely of Arabic
origin. Besides these the principal supernatural beings
are as follows :-the Polong, or familiar : the Hantu Pem-
buru, or spectre Huntsman; the ]adi-jadian, or wer-
tiger; the Hunill, or ghost of the murdered; the Jemalang.
or earth-spirit.
;)!inor Sorcery.-The rites of minor sorcery !lnd witch-
craft, as well as those of the shaman, are widely practised
among the Malays, and are practically identical in character
with those in use among other peoples in a similar state
of culture.

llallebran.che : A m~rker of ~he gam~ of tennis, living in the
Rue Samte-Genev1eve, Parts, who 1n r6r8 was visited by
an apparition of his w:ife, who had died five years before
She came to advise him to repent and live a better life, and
to pray for her also. Both Mallebrancl~e and his wife (for
he had muried a second time) he~rd the voice, but the
apparition did not become visible. In r6r8 a brochure

alleus Mate!learum : A large vohune published in Germany
at the end of the fifteenth century, written by two inquisi-
tors under the papal bull against witchcraft of I484,-
Jacob Sprenger and Henricus Institor. Says Wright
concerning it: " In this celebrated work, the doctrine of
witchcraft was first reduced to a regular system, ar.d it
was the model and groundwork of all that was written
on the subject long after the date which saw its first appear-
ance. Its writers enter largely into the much-disputed
question of the nature of demons : set forth the causes
which lead them to seduce men in this manner; and show
why women are most prone to listen to their proposals, by
reasons which prove that the inqui~itors had but a mean
estimate of the softer sex. The inquisitors show the most
extraordinary skill in explaining all the difficulties which
seemed to beset the subject: they even prove to their entire
satisfaction that persons who have become witches may
easily change themselves into beasts, particularly into
wolves and cats ; and after the exhibition of such a mass
of learning, few would venture any longer to entertain a
doubt. They investigate not only the methods employed
to effect various kinds of mischief, but also the counter-
charms and exorcisms thM may be used against them.
They likewise tell, from their own experience, the dangers
to which t he inquisitors were exposed, and exult in the
fact that they were a class of men against whom sorcery
had no power. These writers actually tell us, that the-
demon had tried to frighten them by day and by night
in the forms of apes, dogs, goats, etc. ; and that they
frequently found large pins stuck in theh night-caps,
which they doubted not came there by witchcraft. When
we hear these inquisitors asserting that the crime of which
the witches were accused, deserved a more extreme punish-
ment than all the vilest actions of which humanity is
capable, we can understand in some degree the complacency
with which they relate how, by their means, forty persons
had been burnt in one place, and fifty in another, and a
still greater number in a third. From the time of the
publication of the Malleus Maleficarum, the continental
press during two or three generations teemed with publi-
cations on the aU-absorbing subject of sorcery.
" One of the points on which opinion had differed most
was, whether the sorcerers were carried bodily through the
air to the place of meeting, or whether it was an imaginary
journey, suggested to their minds by the agency of the-
evil one. The authors of the Malleus decide at once in
favour of the bodily transmission. One of them was-
personally acquainted with a priest of the diocese of
Frisingen, who declared that he had in his younger days
been carried through the air by a demon to a place at a
very great distance from the ~pot whence he had been taken.
Another priest, his friend, declared that he had ~een him.
carried away, and that he appeared to !tim to be borne
up on a kind of cloud. At Baldsbut, on the Rhine, in the
diocese of Constance, a witch confessed, that o.!Iended at
not having been invited to the wedding of an acquaintance,
she had caused herself to be carried thorugh the air in open
daylight to the top of a neighbouring mountain, and there,
having made a hole with her hands and filled it with water~
she had, by stirring the water with certain incantations,
caused a heavy storm to burst forth on the heads of the
wedding-party ; and there were witnesses at the trial who
swore they had seen her carried through the air. The
inquisitors, however, confess that the witches were some·
times carried away, a.q they term it, in the spirit : and
they give the instance of one woman who wa.'! watched by
her husband: she appe.J.red as if asleep, and was insen-
sible, but he perceived a kind of ~Joudy vapour arise out
of her mouth, and vanish from the room in whion she
lay- this after a time rl!turned, and she then awoke, and
gave an account of her ~dventures, as though she had been
carried bodily to the assembly.... . .
.Malphas 266 Margaritomancy
"The witches of the Malleus lvlaleficarum appear to
have been more injurious to horses and cattle than to
mankind. A witch at Ravenspurg confessed that she had
killed twenty-three horses by sorcery. We are led to
wonder most at the ease with which people are brought to.
bear witness to things utterly beyond th.e limits of belief.
A man of the name of Stauff in the territory of Berne,
declarerl that when pursued by the agents of justice, he
escaped by taking the form of a mouse ; and persons were
found to tE:Stify that they had seen him perform this
transmutation.
" The latter part of the work of the two inquisitors gives
minute diredions for the mode in which the prisoners are
to be treated, the means to be used to force them to a
confession, the degree of evidence required for conviction
.of those who would not confess. and the whole process of
the trials. These show sufficiently that the unfortunate
wretch who was once brought before the inquisitors of the
holy see on the suspicion of sorcery, however slight might
be the grounds of the charge. had very small chance of
escaping out of their claws.
" The l'vfalleus contains no distinct allusion to the pro-
ceedings at the Sabbath. The witches of this period
-differ little from those who had fallen into the hands of
the earlier inquisitors at the Council of Constance. Vve
see plainly how, in most Countries, the mysteriously
-indefinite crime of sorcery had first been seized on to ruin
the cause of grl!at political offenders, until the fictitious
importance thus given to it brought forward into a promi-
nent position, which they would, perhaps, never otherwise
have held, the miserable class who were supposed to be
more especially engaged in it. It was the judicial prose-
cutions and the sanguinary executions which followed,
that stamped the character of reality on charges of which
it required two or three centuries to convince mankind
of the emptiness and vanity. One of the chief instruments
in fixing the belief in sorcery, and in giving it that terrible
hold on society which it exhibited in the following century,
was the compilation of Jacob Sprenger and his fellow
inquisitor. In this book sorcery was reduced to a system
but it was· not yet perfect ; and we must look forward,
some half a century before we find it clothed with all the
horrors which cast so much terror into every class of
society."

able to travel on sea or land ; and his sword Fragarach,
a match for any mail ; were brought by Lugh from " The
Land of the Living " (Fairyland). As lord of the sea he
was the Irish Charon, and his colour-changing cloak
would flap gaily as he marched with heavy tread round the
camp of the hostile force invading Erin. He is comparable

Mandragoras : Familiar demons who appear in the figures
of little men "'<ithout beards. Delrio states that one day a
ma>1dragora, entering at the request of a sorcerer, who was
being tried before a court for wizardry, was caught by the
arms by the judge, who did not believe in the existence
-of the spirit, to convince himself of its existence, and
thrown into the fire, where of course it would escape un-
harmed. ,'\1andragoras are thought to be little dolls or
figures given to sorcerers by the Devil for the purpose of
being consulted by them in time of need ; and it would
seem as if this conception had sprung directly from that
of the fetish, which is nothing else than a dwelling-place
made by a shaman or medicine-man for the reception of
any wandering spirit who chooses to take up his abode
therein. The author (){the work entitled Petit Albert says
that on one occasion, whilst travelling in Flanders and
passing through the town of Lille, he was invited by one of
his friends to accompany him to the house of an old woman
who posed as being a great prophetess. This aged person
conducted the two friends into a dark cabinet lit only by a
single lamp, where they could see upon a table covered
with a cloth a kind of little statue or mandragora, seated
upon a tripod and having the left hand extended and hold-
ing a hank of silk very delicately fashioned, from which
was suspended a small piece of iron highly polished. Plac-
ing under this a crystal glass so that the piece of iron was
suspended inside the goblet, the old woman commanded the
figure to strike the iron against the glass in such a manner
as she wished, saying at the same time to the figure: " I
command you, il1andragora, in the name of those to whom
you are bound to give obedience, to know if the gentleman
present will be happy in the journey which he is about to
make. If so, strike three times with the iron upon the
goblet." The iron struck three times as demanded without
the old woman having touched any of the apparatus, much
to the surprise of the two spectators. The sorceress put
several other questions to the Mandragol'a, who struck
the glass once or thrice as seemed good to him. But, as
the author shows, the whole was an artifice of the old
woman, for the piece of iron suspended in the goblet was
extremely light and when the old woman wished it to
strike against the glass, she held in one of her hands a
ring set with a large piece of magnetic stone, the virtue of
which drew the iron towards the glass.
The ancients attributed' great virtues to the plant
called mandragoras or mandrake. which was supposed to
be somewhat in the shape of a man, and when plucked
from the earth to emit a spocies of human cry. It was also
worn to ward off various diseases. (See Exorcism.)

Marshall, Mrs. : An English medium who gave open seances
from 1858 onwards. Unlike m any of the early mediums
she practised professionally, and was for some time the
only professional medium of note in this country. The
phenomena witnessed included communication by means of
rapping, playing on musical instruments, touchings by
invisible hands, and all the more familiar forms. A writer
in All the Yeaf' Rout~d, July 28th, 186<>, characterised Mrs.
Marshall's performance as a " dull and barefaced imposi-
tion," but Robert Dell, the celebrated dramatist, writing
in the Cornhill Magazine was satisfied that the phenomena
were genuine spirit manifestations. (See Spiritualism.)

Martian L!lnguage : A language purporting to be that of the
inhabitants of the planet Mars, written and spoken by
the medium known as Hel~ne Smith. Hel~ne, the medium
studied by a celebrated investigator, M. Flournoy, pro-
fessor of J?Sychology at Geneva, had in 1892 joined a
spiritualistic circle, where she developed marvellous me·
diumistic powers. In 1896, after Professor Flournoy had
begun his investigations, she was spirited during a trance
to the planet Mars, and thereafter described to the circle
the m3.nners and customs and appearance of the Martians.
She learned their language, which she wrote and speke
with ease and consi.'!tency. Unlike most of the" unknown
tongues " automatically produced the Martian language
was intelligible, its words were used consistently, and on
the whole it had every appearance of a genuine language.
T hat it was in any way connected with Mars is out of
~he question. The descriptions of that planet and its
tnhabitants are quite impossible. And the language
itself bears a remarkable resemblance to French, the native
tongue of the medium. The grammar and construction of
botli languages are the same, and even the vowel·sounds
~re identical, so that the source of the Jlfartian ta11guage

Marlin was born about the year 316 at 5abaria, in
Pannonia. His parents were heathen, yet he very soon
came into contact with Christians, and theit teaching
impressed him greatly. As a young man he entered the
army, and it was soon after this step that, while stationed
with his regiment at Amiens, he performed his famous
act of charity, dividing his cloak with a beggar who was
shivering with cold. The night after this generous act he
was vouchsafed a vision, Christ appearing to him and
giving him his blessing; and thereupon Martin espoused
the Christian faith formally, he was baptised and renounced
soldiering once and for all. Going to Poitiers, he then
made the acquaintance of Hilary, who wished to make
him a deacon, but at his own requjlSt ordained him to the
humbler office of an exorcist; and a little later, d uring a
visit to his h'ome, Martin experienced the joy of winning
his mother from heathendom to the new fa1th. However,
his open zeal in opposing the Arians raised persecution
against him, and for a considerable space he found it
ad\•isable to live at the island of Gallinaria, near Genoa, in
which quiet retreat he had ample leisure for scientific
researches and theological studies ; but by the year 365
he :was back \vitb Hilary at Poitiers, when he founded the
Monasterium Locociagense. Then, in 371, the people of
Tours chose him as their bishop, and for some time subse-
quently he showed great activity in trying to extirpate
idolatry in his diocese, and in extending the monastic
system. Nevertheless, he 'vas anything but a fierce
proseletyser, and at Trhes. in 385, he entreated that the
lives of the Priscillianist heretics should be spared, while
he ever afterwards refused to have an~ to do with those
bishops who had sanctioned their execution. Meanwhile,
being anxious for another period of quiet study, Martin
had established the monastery of Marrnontier les Tours,
on the banks of the Loire; and here much of his remaining
life was spent, yet it was at Candes that his death occurred
about the year 400.
Martin left no writings behind him, the Confessio with
which he is sometimes credited being undoubt~dly spurious.
His life was written by his ardent disciple. Sulpicius
Severus, and a curious document it is, filled with accounts
of the miracles and marvels worked by the quondam bishop.
Thanks to his triumphs herein. Martin was duly sanctified
by the church, and he is commemorated on the u th of
November ; but the feast of Martinmas, which occurs on
that date, and which of course derives its name from him.
is; nevertheless, a survival of an old pagan festival ; and
it inherited certain usages thereof, this accounting for the
fact that Martin is regarded as the patron saint of deep
potations. Certain of his miracles, and other incidents in
his life, were figured by numerous painters of note, perhaps
the finest picture of him being one by the Flemish master,
H ugo van der Goes, which is now in the Municipal Museum
at Glasgow ; while it behoves to add that the term Martinet,
signifying a severe and punctilious person, is not derived
from the saint's name, but from one Jean Martinet, a
French soldier who. during the reign of LQuis XIV., won
fame by his ardour in promoting discipline in his regiment.

Materiallsation : A term denoting the formation by a spirit
of a temporary physical organisation, visible and palpable,
by means or which it can come into touch with material
objects. Molerialisalion is the most important of the
physical phenomena of spiritualism. and in its earlier
stages was confined to the materialising of heads and hands,
or vague luminous figures. In common with much of the
physical phenomena, it had its origin in America, where
it was known at a comparatively'early period in the history
of the movement. So early as r86o seances were held with
the Fox sisters by Robert Dale Owen and others, at which
veiled and luminous figures were witnes.<;ed. One sitter,
Mr. Livermore, saw and recognised the spirit of his dead
wife many times during a series of seances "itb Kate Fox,
extending over some six years. In this case, however,
there were no other sitters, and the seances were held in
the dark, the whole atmosphere being peculiarly favourable
to fraud. In xfl71 another American medium, Mrs.
Andrews, held sittings at which materialised forms were
seen, and in the following year l\Irs. Guppy and another
medium attempted the production of a similar phenomenon
in England, but without marked success. The mediums,
Herne and William<;, succeeded a few months later in
materiali~ing shadowy forms and faces in a dark seance-
room. It wi.s, however, l\liss Florence Cook, to whose
phenomena Sir 'William Crookes has so abundantly testified,
who W.!S to give the most remarkable demonstration of
this form of spirit manifestation. l\Iiss Cook was, at the
comme:1cement of her spiritualistic career, a young girl of
sixteen or seventeen years, described by a contemporary
wrjter as "a pretty, j ewish-like little girl." She was at
that time a pnvate medium, though at the outset she held
some t>~ateriali;atr>m seances with Herne. From her
childhood, it was said, she had been attended by a spirit-
girl, who stated that her name on earth had been Annie
:Morgan, but that her name in the spirit-w::>rld was K1.tie
King. Under the latter name ::lliss Cook's control was
destined to become very famous in spiritualistic circles.
Usually the m~dium was put in a sort of cupboard, or
cabinet, tied to her chair, and the cords sealed. A short
interval would ensue, during which the sitterssangspiritual-
istic hymns, and at length there would emerge from the
cabinet a form clad in fiowin~ white drape1ies, and not to
be distinguished from an ordtnary human being. On one
occasion a seance was held at Mr. Cook's house, at which
several distinguished spiritualists were present. Among
the invited gue::.ts was Mr. ·w. Volckman, who thought to
test for himself the good faith of the medium and the
genuineness of " Katie." After some forty minutes close
observance .of the materialised spirit l\ir. Vo!ckmau con-
cluded that Miss Cook and Katie were one and the same,
and just as the white-robed figure was about to return to
the cabinet he rushed forward and seized her. His indig-
nant feUow-sitters released the ·• spirit," the light was
extinguished, and in the confusion that followed the spirit
dis:lppeared. Miss Cook was found a few minutes later
bound as when she was placed in the cabinet, the cords
unbroken, the seal intact. She wore a black dress, and
there was no trace of white draoeries in the cabinet. Sir
William Crookea, whose investigations into the phenomena
of this medium extended over a period of some years, had
better opportunity of examining I<atie's pretensions than
1\Ir. Volckman had, and he had left it on record that the
spirit form was taller than the medium, had a larger face
and longer fingers ; and whereas Florence Cook had black
hair and a dark complexion. Katie's complexion was fair
a:1d her hair a light auburn. Moreover Sir William,
enjoying as he did the complete confidence of Katie, had
on more than one occasion the privilege of seeing her and
Miss Cook at the same time. But Miss Cook was not the
only medium who was controlled by I<atie King, who,
v.;th her father, john King, became in time a most popular
spirit v.ith maferiolisatiotr mediums. From that time
onwards moteriolisa:io11 was extensively practised both
by private and professional mediums, among the number
being !\Irs. Shower~ and her daughter, Rita, Miss Lottie
Fowler. William Eglinton ar.d D. D. Home; while in
recent years materia!isatiotrs are stated to have occurred
in the presence of Eusapia Palladino. l\Iany sitters
claimed to see in these draped figures and veiled faces the
form and features of deceased relatives and friends, though
frequently there was but the smallest ground for such a
cla.iin-pa.rents recognised their daughter by her hair. a
m:1n reco~tnised his mother by the sort of cap ~he wore, and
so on. There is no doubt that fraud entered. and still
enters, very largely into maurialisation ~ances. Lay
figure:;, muslin draperies, false hair, and similar properties
have been found in the possession of mediums; accom-
plices have been smug-gled into the seance-room ; lights
are frequently turned low or extinguished altogether.
Add to this the fact that other spirits beside~ " Katie ''
have on being grasped resolved themselves into the person
of the medium, and it will be seen that scepticism is not
altogether unjustified. Then, as already mentioned, the
rash and premature reco;;nition of dece~ed friends in
draped forms whose resemblance to the medium is patent
to the less-interested observer, has also done much to ruin
the case for genuine spirit malrrialisaliot~. Yet that
there is a case we must believe on the assertion of some
of the most distinguished of modern inve~tigato.-s, men
fully alive to the possibilities of fraud, tr:1ined to habits of
correct observation. M. Flammarion felt constrained to
attribute the materialisafions he had witnessed in the
presence of Eusapia Palladino to fluidic emanations from
the medium's person, while judging the recognition accorded.
to them the result of illusion. Others state that the
physical organisation formed by the spirit is composed of
fine particles of matter drawn from the material world.
By way of explaining the numerous exposures that have
been made from time to time various theories of a more or
les~ ingenious character have been advanced by spiritualists.
In a case of obvious fraud they declare that the spirits have
controlled the medium to secrete wigs and draperies in the
cabinet. If a spirit on being held by a sitter proves to be
the medium herself an explanation is also forthcoming.
The medium, it is said, imparts to the spirit a certain
portion of her ,·ita! energy, so that the spirit may " mani-
fest." When the latter is ruthlessly grasped these two
pot tions of the medium's vit.'\1 spirits tend to re-unite, so
that either the medium will draw the spirit into the cabinet,
or the spirit will draw the medium out. 1 he reason that
the cnion generally takes place without the cabinet is that
the medium has imparted to the control more of her energy
tl1an she had retained.

Medea : An enchantress, daughter of the king of Colchis,
who fell in love with Jason when he <".arne to that country,
and enabled him to slay the sleepless dragon that guarded
the golden fleece. She ned from Colchis with Jason who
made her his wife, and from whom she exacted a pledge
never to love another woma11. Her yonng brother. having
been found on board the ship they sailed in, she tore him in
p ieces and flung him into tM sea. She accompanied Jason
to Greece, where she was looked ort as a barbarian, but
having conciliated King Pclcus who was now a very old
man, she induced him to try to regain youth by bathing in
a magic cauldron of whi~h she was to prepare the contents.
So great was his faith in her powers, that the old man
unhesitatingly plunged into her cauldron and was boiled
alive. Her reason for this frightful act of cruelty was to
hasten the succession to the throne of Jason, who in due
course would have succeeded Peleus ; but now the Greeks
would have none of either him or :Vledea, and he was
forced to leave !oleos. GrO\\ing tired oi the formidable
enchantress to whom he had bound himself, Jason
sought to contract an alliance with Glauce, a young prin-
cess. Dissembling her real intentions, Medea feigned
friendship with the bride-elect and sent her as a wedding
present a garment, which as soon as Glauce put it on,
caused her to die in the greatest agony. Sh~llifedea­
parted from Jason ; having murdered her two children
by him, she fled from Corinth in her car drawn by dragons,
to Athens, where she married Argcus, by whom she had a
son, Medus. But the <iiscovery of an attempt on the life
of Theseus, forced her to leave Athens. Accompanied
by her son, she returned to Colchis, and restored her father
to the throne, of which he had been deprived by bis own
brother Perses. A great amount of literature has been
written arounll llfedea: Euri~idcs, Ennius, Aeschylus, and
later, Thom:~.s Corncille havmg malle her the theme of

.Medicine, Occult : " The whole power of the occult physi-
cian," says Eliphas Levi, " is in the conscience of his will,
while his whole art consists in exciting the faith of his
patient. ' If you have faith,' says the Master, ' all things
are possible to him who believes.' The confidence must
be dominated by expression, tone, gesture ; confidence
must be inspired by a fatherly manner, and cheerfulness
stimulated by seasonable and sprightly conversations.
Rabelais, who was a greater magician than he seemed, made
pantagruelism his special panacea. He compelled his
patients to laugh, arid all the remedies he subsequently
gave them succeeded better in consequence; he established
a magnetic sympathy between himself and them, by means
of which be communicated to them his own confidence
and good humour ; he flattered them in his prefaces,
termed them his precious, most illustrious patients, and
dedicated his books to them. So are we convinced that
Gargantua and Pantagruel cured more black humours,
more tendencies to madness, more atrabilious whims, at
that epoch of religious animosities and civil wars, than the
whole Faculty of medicine could boast. Occult medicit;e is
essentially sympathetic. Reciprocal affection, or at least
real good will, must exist between doctor and patient.
Syrups and juleps have very little inherent virtue; they
are what they become through the mutual opinion of
operator and subject; hence homcepathic medicines dispt>nses
with them and no serious inconvenience follows. Oil and
"ine, combined with salt or camphor, are sufficient for the
healing of all afflictions, and for all external frictions or
soothing applications, oil and wine, are the chief medica-
ments of the Gospel tradition. They formed the balm of
the Good Samaritan, and in the Apocalypse, when des-
cribing the last plagues, the prophet prays the avenging
powers to spare these substances, that is, to leave a hope
and a remedy for so many wounds: 'What we term extreme
unction was the pure and simple practice of the Master's
traditional medicint', both for the cady Christians and in
the mind of the apostle Saint James, who has included the
precept in his epistle to the aith!ul of the whole world,
' Is any man sick among you,' he writes, ' let t.im call in
the priests of the church, and let tht-m pray over him,
anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.' This
divine therapeutic science was lost gradually, anll EJ~."heme
Unction came to be regarded as a religious formality
neces<~ary as a preparation for death. At the same time,
the thaumaturgic virtue of consecrated oil could not be
altogether effaced from remembrance by the traditionaI
doctrine, and it is perpetuated in the pass3ge of the cate-
chism which refers to Extreme Unction. Faith and charity
were the most signal healing powers among the early
Christians. The source of most diseases is in moral
disorders; we must begin by healing the soul, and then the
cure of the body will follow quickly."
Medimval Magic : In the belief of the mediccval professors
of the science of magic, it conferred upon the adept power
over angels, demons, elementary spirits and the souls of
the dead, the possession of ~otcric wisdom, and actual
knowledge of the discovery and use of the latent forces and
undeveloped energies resident in man. This vvas supposed
to be accomolishcd by a combination of will and aspiration,
which by sheer force germinate a new intellrct~:.:.t faculty
of psychological perception, enabling the adept to view
the wonders of a new world and communicate with its
inhabitants. To accomplish this the ordinary faculties
were almost invariably heightened by artificial means.
The grandeur of the magical ritual overwhelmed the neo-
phyte, and wondrously quickened his senses. Ceremonial
magic was a marvellous spur to the latent faculties of man's
psychic nature, just as were the rich concomitants of
rcligiQus mysticism. In the meditiiVal mind, as in other
periods of man's history, it was thought that magic could
be employed both for gooll and evil purposes,-its branches
being designated " white," and " black," as it is used for
benevolent or wicked ends. The term " red " magic is
also occasionally employed, as indicating a mprc exalted
type of the art, but the designation is fanciful. White
magic, to a great extent, concerned itself with the evocation
of angelic forces and of the spirits of the elements. The
angelology of the Catholic Church was und011btedly derived
from the ancient faith of Israel, which in turn was indebted
to Egypt and Babylon ; and the Alexandrian system of
successive f'manations from the one and eternal substance,
evolved a complex hierarchy of angels, all of whom appear
to have been at the bidding of him who was in possession of
Medireval Magio 270 Medireval Magie
the Incommunicable Name,-a concept borrowed purely
from that of the Name of Power so greatly made usc of iu
Egyptian ma&ic (Se11 Egypt,) The letters which composed
this name were thought to possess a great mca~urc of occuit
significance, and a power which in turn appears to have
been re!lected upo'l the entire Hebrew alphabet (See Kabala),
which was thus endowed with mystical meaning, each of
the letters representing a vital and creative number.
Just as a language i3 formed from the letters of its alphabt>t,
so from the secret powers which resided in the Hebrew
alphabet, were evolved magical variations. From the
letter ·• aleph " to that of " jod " the angelical world was
symbolised. From " caf " to ·• tsed " were represented
the several orders of angels who inhabited the various
spheres, each of which was under the direction of a particu-
lar intelligence. From " tsed " to " thau " is in secret
correspondence with the elemental world ; so that there
were intelligences in correspondence with each of the
Hebrew letters,-" aleph " with the Haioth-ha-kodesch
of the seraphim, the first and supreme angelical rank;
" beth " the second letter with the ophanim or angels of the
second order ; " gimcl " with the aralim or angels of the
third order, and so on to the tenth letter " jod," which com
pletcs the enumeration of the angelical spheres. The
rest of the Hebrew alphabet, however, corresponds to
individual principalities and powers-all of whom hold
an important place in the mystical universe. Thus " caf"
the eleventh letter is in correspondence with Mettatron
who belongs to the first heaven of the astronomic world.
:Final " caf." the next letter, corresponds to the intelligences
of the secret order whose supreme chief is Raziel ; and
" lamed " the twelfth letter corresponds to those of the
third sphere, that of Saturn, whose lord is Schebtaiel : and
so on : these intelligences under their queen, with the

intelligences were conjared by rites to be found in the
ancient book known as the Key of Solomo11, and perhaps
the most satisfactory collection of formula! for the invoca·
tion of the higher angels is that included in the anonymous
Theosophia Pnez,matica, published at Frankfort in r686,
which bears a strong family resemblance to the Treatise
on ,'1tfagic by Arbatel. The names in this work do not tally
with those which have been already given, but as it is
admitted by occult students that the names of all unseen
beings arc really unknown to humanity, this does not
seem of such importance as it might at first sight. It
would seem that such spiritual '4nowledge as the medit$val
magus was capable of attaining was insufficient· to raise
him above the intellectual limitations of his time, so that
the work in question possesses all the faults of its age and
type. But that is not to say that it is possessed of no
practical value ; and it may be taken as well-illustrating
the white magic of medit$Val timt>s. It classifies the names
of the angels under the title of Olympic or Celestial Spirits,
who abide in the .fi.rmament and constellations : they
administer inferior destinies and accomplish and teach
whatever is portended by the several stars in which they
are insphered. They are powerless to act without a
special command from the Almighty. The stewards of
Heaven a~e seven !n number- Arathron, Bcthor, Phaleg.
Och, Hag1th, Oph1el, and Phul. Each of them has a
numerous host at his command, and the regions in which
they dwell are 196 in all. Arathron appears on Saturday
~t th~ first hour, and answers for his territory and its
mhab1tants ; as do the others, each at his own day and
hour : and each presides for a period of 490 years. The
functions of Bethor began in the fiftieth year before the
~irth of Christ 430. Pha~lc reigned till A.D. 920; Och
till the year I.po; Hagtlh governed until A.D. 1900.
Tbe others follow in succession. These intelligences are
the stewards of all the elements, energising the firmament
and, with their armies, depending from each other in a
re~ular hierarchy. The names of the minor Olympian
Spirits are interpreted in divers ways, but those alone are
powerful which they themselves give, which are adapted
to the end for which they have been summoned. Generic-
ally, they are called Astra, and their power is seldom
prolonged beyond one hundred and forty years. The
heavens and their inhabitants come vohmtarily to man
and often serve a~ainst even the will of man, but ho'"
much more if we 1mplore their ministry. That evil and
troublesome spirits also approach men is accomplished by
the cunning of the devil, at times by conjuration or attrac-
t ion, and frequently as a penalty for sins ; therefore, shall
he who would abide in familiarity with celestial intelligences
take pains to avoid every serious sin ; he shall diligent ly
pray for the protection of God to vanquish the impediments
and schemes of Diabolus, and God will ordain that the
devil himself shall work to the direct profit of the Theoso-
phist. Subject to Divine Providence, some spirits have
power over pestilence and famine, some are destroyers of
cities, like those of Sodom and Gomorrah, some are rulers
over kingdoms, some guardians of provinces, some of a
single person. The spirits arc the ministers of the word
of God, of the Church and its members, or they serve
creatures in material things, sometimes to the salvation
of soul and body, or, again, to the ruin of both. But
nothing, good or bad, is done without knowledge, order,
and administration.
It is unnecessary to follow the angelical host farther
here, as we have outlined it elsewhere. Many preparationsr
however, are described by the author of the Theosophia
Pnezmzatica for the successful evocation of these exalted
beings. The magus rnust ponder during his period of
initiation on the method of attaining the true knowledge
of God, both by ni'ght and day. He must know the laws
of the ~osmos, and the practical secrets which may be
gleaned from the study of the visible and invisible creatures
of God. He must further know himself, and be able to
distinguish between his mortal and immortal parts, and
the several spheres to which they belong. Both in his
mortal and immortal natures, he shall strive to love God,
to adore and to fear him in spirit and in truth. He must
sedulously attempt to .lind out whether he is fitted for the
practice of magic, and if so to what branch he should turn
his t alents, experimenting in all to discover in which he is
most naturally gifted. He must hold inviolate such
secrets as are communicated to him by spirits, and he must
accustom himself to their evocation. He must keep him-
self, however, from the least suspicion of diabolical magic,.
which has to do with Satan, and which is the perversion of
the theurgic power concealed in the word of God. When
he has fulfilled these conditions, and before he proceeds to
the practice of his art, he should devote a prefatory period
to deep contemplation on the high business which he has
voluntarily taken in hand, and must present himself before
God with a pure heart, undefiled mouth and innocent
.Medi<eval Magic 271 Medium
bands. He must bathe frequently and wear clean gar-
ments, confess his sins and abstain from wine for the space
of three days. On the eve of operation, he must dine
sparely at noon, and sup on bread and water, and on the
day he has chosen for the invocation he must seek a retired
and uncontaminated spot, entirely free from observation.
After offering up prayer, he compels the spirit which he
has chosen to appear : that is, he has passed into a con-
dition, whcq it is impossible that the spirit should remain
invisible to him. On the arrival of the a11gel, the desire
of the magus is briefly communicated to him, and his answer
is written down. More than three questions should not be
asked, and the angel is then dismissed into his special
sphere. Besides having converse with angels, the magus
had also po,ver over the spirits of the elements. The
reader is referred to the special article upon these, and we
shall confine ourselves in this place to describing the manner
of their evocation. To obtain power over the salamanders
for eJCample, the Comtc de Gabalis gives the following
receipt : ·• If you would recover empire over the salaman-
ders, purify and exalt the natural fire that is within you.
Nothing i!' requirecl for this purpose but the concentration
of the Fire of the ·world by means of concave mirrors in a
globe of glass. In that globe is formed the ' solary '
powder, which being of itself purified from the mixture of
other clements, and bein~ prepared according to Art be-
comes in a very short ttme a sovereign process for the
exaltation of the fire that is )'lithin you, and transmutes you
into an igneous nature." There is very little matter
extant to show in what manner the evocation of Elementary
spirits was undertaken, and no ritual has survived which
will acquaint us with the method of communicating with
them. In older writers it is difficult to distinguish between
angels and elementary spirits, and it is probable that the
lesser angels of the older magicians were the sylphs of
Paracelsus, and the more modern professors of the art.
The lower hierarchies of the elementary spirits were also
frequently invoked by the black magician. Eliphas Levi
provides a method for the interrogation and government of
elementary spirits ; but he does not acquaint us with its
source, and it is merely fragmentary. "It is necessary,"
he says, " in order to dominate these intelligences, to
undergo the four trials of ancient initiation, and as these
are unknown, their room must be supplied by similar
~ests. To approach the salamanders, therefore, one must
expose himself in a burning house. To· draw near the
sylphs he must cross a precipice on a plank, or ascend a
lofty mountain in a storm ; and he who would win to the
abode of the undines must plunge into a cascade or whirl-
pool. Thus power being acquired through courage and
indomitable energy this fire, earth and water must be
consecrated and exorcised."
The air is exorcised by the suffiation of the four cardinal
points, the recitation of the prayer of the sylphs, and by
the following formula :-The Spirit of God moved upon
the water, and breathed into the nostrils of man the breath
of life. De ~1ichacl my leader, and be Sabtabiel my ser-
vant, in the name and by the virtue of light. Be the power
of the word in my breath, and I will govern the spirits of
this creature of Air, and by the will of my soul, I will
restrain the steeds of the sun, and by the thought of my
mind, and by the apple of my right eye. I exorcise thee
0 creature of Air, by the Petagrammaton, and in the name
Tetragrammaton, wherein arc st~adfast wiU and well-
directed faith. Amen. Sela. So be it.
Water is exorcised by the laying on of hands, by breath-
ing and by speech, and by mixing sacred salt with a little
of the ash which is left in an incense pan. The aspergillus
is made of branches of vervain, periwinkle, sage, mint, ash,
and basil, tied by a thread taken from a virgin's distaff,
with a handle of hazelwood which has never borne fruit,
and on which the characters of the seven spirits must be-
graven with the magic awl. The salt and ashes of the
incense m\lst be separately consecrated. The prayer of
the undines should follow.
Fire is exorcised by casting salt, incense, white resin,
camphor and sulphur therein, and by thrice pronouncing
the three names of the genii of fire-:\'Iichael, Samael, and
Anacl, and then by reciting the prayer of the salamanders.
The Earth is exorcised by the sprinkling of water, by
breathing, and by fire, and the prayer of the gnomes.
Their signs are-the hieroglyphs of the Dull for the Gnomes
who are commanded with the magic sword ; of tl:e Lion
for the Salamanders, who are commanded with the forked
rod, or magic trident ; of the Eagle for the Slyphs, who
are ruled by the holy pentacles; and, finally, of Aquarius
for the Undines, who arc evoked by the cup of libations.
Their respective sovereigns are Gob for the Gnomes, Djin
for the Salamanders, Paralda for the Sylphs, and Necksa
for the Undincs. These names, it will be noticed, are
borrowed from folklore.
The " layins" of an elementary spirit is accomplished
by its adjurahon by air, water, fire, and earth, by breath-
ing, sprinkling, the burning of perfumes, by tracing on the
ground the Star of Solomon and the sacred Pentagram,
which should be drawn either with ash of consecrated fire
or v;ith a reed soaked in various colours, mixed with pure
loadstone. The Conjuration of the Four should then be
repeated, the magus holding the pentacle of Solomon in his
hand and taking up by turns the sword, rod and cup,-this
operation being preceded and terminated by the Kabal-
istic sign of the cross. I n order to subjugate an elementary
spirit, the magus must be himself free of their besetting
sins ; thus a changeful person cannot rule the sylphs, nor a
fickle one the undincs, an ang-ry man the salamanders, or a
covetous one the gnomes. We have given elsewhere (See
Necromancy) the formula for the evocation of spirits, so there
is no necessity to repeat it in this place. The white magician
did not concern himself as a rule with such matters as the
raising of !lemons, animal transformations and the like, his
whole desire being the exaltation of his spiritual nature ;
and the questions put by him to the spirits he evoked were
aU directed to that end. (See !If::gle.)
Medloa, l'rlichael : (See Healing by Touch.)
Medium : A person supposed to be qualified in some spedal
manner to form a link between the dead and the living.
Through him the spirits of the departed may communicate
with their friends still on earth, either by making usc of the
material organism of the medium himself (" automatic
phenomena ") or by producing in the physical world
certain manifestations which cannot be explained by
known physical laws. The essential qualification of a
medium is an abnormal sensitiveness, which enables him
to be readily " controlled " by disembodied spirits. For
this reason medittms arc also known as se11sitives. There
is some doubt as to whether mediumship is an inherent
faculty, or whether it may be acquired ; and among some
spiritualists at least, the belief is held that all men are
mediums, though in varying degrees, and consequently
that all arc in communication with.the spirits, from whom
proceeds what we call ·• inspiration." Those who are
ordinarily designated " mediums " are but gifted with the
common faculty in a higher degree than their fellows.
:\1ediumship, like all the central doctrines of spiritualism,
dates back to very early times. Demoniac possession
affords an excellent instance ; so also does witchcraft,
while the somt~ambulc of the mesmerists was identical
with the modern medium. In its usual application, how-
ever, the term medium is used only of those sensiti\'es who
belong to the modern spiritualistic movement, which had
Medium 272 Medium
its origin in America in td48 (See Spiritualism.) In this
sense, then, Mrs. Fox and her daughters, the heroines of
the Rochester Rappings, were the earliest mediums. The
phenomena of their seances consisted mainly of knockings,
by means of which messages were conveyed from the spirits
to the sitters. Other mediums rapidly spra'{lg up. first in
Am~rica, and later in Britain and the Continent. Their
mediumship was of two kinds," physical" and automatic.
These phases were to be found either separately or com·
bined in one person, as in the case of the Rev. Stainton
Moses (q.v.) Indeed, it was practically impossible to find
a trance speaker who did not at one time or another practise
the physical manifestations, until the time of Mrs. Piper,
whose phenomena were purely subjective. The early
rappings speedily developed into more elaborate manifesta-
tions. For a few years an epidemic of table-turning (q. v.)
caused wide-spread excitement, and the motions of the table
became a favourite means 9f communicating with the
spirits. The playing of musical instruments without
visible agency was a form of manifestation which received
the attention of mediums from an early date, as was
also the bringing into the seance-room of "apports" of
fruit, flowers, perfume, and all manner of portable property.
Darkness was found to facilitate the spirit-manifestations,
and as there are certain physical processes, such as those
in photography, to which darkness is essential, no logical
objection could be offered to the dimness of the seance-
room. The merrrbers of the circle were generally seated
round a table, holding each other's hands. and they were
often enjoined to sing or talk pending the materialisation
of a spirit. All tlus, though oaering grounds of suspicion
to the incredulous, was plausibly explained by the spiritual-
ists. As time went on. and the demand for ph)fl>ical mani-
festations increased, these became more daring and more
varied. The moving of objects without contact, the
Jevitation of heavy furniture, and of the persons of medium
or sitters, the elongation of the human body, the fire-ordeal,
were all practised by the medium Home. At the seances
of the Davenport Brothers musical instruments were played
and moved about the room, and objects !XIJ)Ved without
being touched, while the medir<ms were bollud hand and
foot in a small cabinet. The slate-writing of "Dr." Slade
and 'William Eglinton had a considerable vogue. The
tying of knots in endless cords, the passage of solids,
through solids, were commonplaces of the mediumis~c
circle. The crowning achievement, however, was the
materialisation of the spi:it-form. Quite early in the
history of spintualism bands were materialised, then
fac-es, and finally the complete form of the " control."
Thereafter the m•ierialised spirits allowed themselves to
be touched, and even condescended, on occasion, to hold
conversations with the sitters. Fu1i:her proof of the
actuality of the spirif ·• control " was offered by spirit
photography (q.v.).
To those for whom spiritualism was a religion, however,
much the most important part of the mediumiStic per-
formances is the trance-utterances and the like which come
under the beading of " autom:~tic,'· or psychological
phenomena. These dealt largely with the conditions of
life on the other side of the grave, and in style they tended
to be verbose and incoherent. The spirit-drawings, also,
were lacking in depths and distinction. Clairvoyance and
crystal vision are included in the psychological phenomena,
and so also are the pseudo·prophetic utterances of mediums,
and the spc,1king in unknown tongues. According to the
spiritualistic hypothesis already referred to, that " all men
are mediums," it would be necessary to class inspiration,
not only the inspiration of genius, but all good or evil
impulses-as spiritual phenomena, and thatin turn suggests
that the every-day life of the normal individual is to some
extent directed by spirit " controls." And therein lies
the responsibility of mediumship, for if he would be con-
trolled by pure spirits from the higher sphere.c;, it behoves
the medium to hve a well-conducted and principled life.
Misuse of the divine gift of mediumship carries with it its
own punishment, for the medium becomes the sport of base
human spirits and elementals (q.v.). his will is sapped, and
his whole being degraded. Likewise he must be wary of
giving up his personality to the first spirit who comes his
way, for the low and earth-bound spirits have least difficulty
in communicating with the living, having still more affinity
with the things of the earth than with those of the spirit.
Of the physical mediums perhaps the most successful was
Daniel Dunglas Home (I833-x886), who claimed to be of
Scottish birth. He went to America, however, at an early
age, and it was there that his mediumistic powers were
first developed, though not until he came to Britain in
1855 did he rise to fame. It is worthy of note that Home
was never detected in fraud-as the bulk of physical
mediums have been at one time or another-though his
performances were similar in kind to those of other mediums.
This may be due in part to the fact that he did not act as a
professional medium, and his sitters, being either his guests
or his hosts, were doubtless ce!ftrained by courtesy from
a too close enquiry into his methods. Again, all who came
into contact with him were impressed by his simple manners,
and frank and affectionate disposition, so that he possessed
the most valuable asset of a medium--the ability to inspire
confidence in his sitters. Mediums of a different stamp,
though widely popular in their day, were the brothers
Davenport. T heir performance consisted of allowing
themselves to be securely bound in a cabinet by the sitters,
and while thu3 handicapped producing the usual medium-
istic phenomena. The Davenports were shown to be mere
conjurers. however, and when Maskelyne and Cook success-
fully imitated their feats the exposure was complete.
Slate-writing, which proved one of the most widely-accepted
forms of psychic phenomena, had as its principal exponents
Henry Slade and William Eglinton. The best argument
which can be advanced against their feats is to be found
in the pseudo-seances of Mr. S. J. Davey. given in the
interests of the Society for Psychical Research. Mr.
Davey's slate-writing exhibitions were so like to tho!.e of
the professional m~diums that the spiritualists refused to
believe that he was conjuring, and hailed him i.S'a renegade
medil4m! Auto:natic drawing was principally represented
by David Duguid, a Glasgow medium who attained con·
siderable success in that line. Prominent -tr.ance speakers
and writers were Duguid, J. J. Morse, Mrs. Hardinge
Britten, and Mrs. Cora L. V. Tappan-Richmond. One of
the best-known and most respected of private mediums
was the Rev. Stainton Moses (1839-92), a clt:rgyman and
schoolmaster, whose normll life, at least, was beyond
reproach. He produced both automatic and physical
manifestations, the former including.the writing of a work
Spirit Teachings, dictated from time to time by his spirit
"controls." while the latter comprised levitations, lights,
"apports," and so on. Hi-; position, character, and
education gave to hi::. support of spiritualism a stability of
considerable value.
It is to later m~dium~. however, that we must look for
proof worthy of scientific consideration, and of these the
most important arc Eusapia Palladino and M.rs. Piper.
Eusapia Palladino, an Italian medium, was born in 1854,
and for a good many years had acted as medium for scientific
investigators. In 1892 seances were held at :Milan, at
which were present Professors Schiaparelli, Bro~erio,
Lobmroso, Richet. and others. In 1894 Professor R•chet
conducted some experiments with Eusapia at his house in.
the Ile Roubaud, to which he invited Professor Lodge, 1\Ir.
Medium 273
l\lyers, and Dr. Ochorowiez. The phenomena occurring
in Eusapia's presence were the ordinary manifestations of
the mediumistic seance, but their interest lay in the fact
that all the distinguished investigators professed themselves
satisfied that the medium, with her hands, head, and feet
<:ontroUed by the sitters, could not of herself produce the
phenomena. Credible witnesses asserted that Eusapia
possessed the ability to project false or psychic limbs from
her person. Professor Lodge and Mr. ~lyers were disposed
to look for a new force (ectenic force) emanating from +..be
medium. In 1895. however, some seances with Eusapia
were held at Mr. Myers' house at Cambndge, where it
became apparent that she habitually freed a hand or a
fvot-in short, habitually resorted to fraud. Yet even
these exposures were not conclusive for in r8g8, after a
iurther series of experiments, ~rr. Myers and Professors
Lodge and Richet once more declared their beliei in the
genuineness of this medi1m1's phenomena.
!\Irs. Piper, the Boston t~dium whose trance utterances
and writings contain the best evidence forthcoming in
recent years for the truth of spiritualism, first fell into a
spontaneous trance in x884, and in the following year was
observed by Professor James of Harvard. Thereafter her
case was carefully studied by the Society for Psyehical
Research. Her first important " control " was a French
physician, Dr. Phinuit, who was probably a fiction, but
in x8gz she was controlled by George Pelham. a young
author who had died in Februaryof that year. Socomplete
was her impersonation of Pelham that more than thirty of
his friends cla1med to recognise him, and so well. did he
establish his identity by the mention of many private
matters, known only to himself and a few of his friends, that
the hypothesis of spirit-control was almost inevitable. In
x8g6 George Pelham gave place to" Imperator," " Rector,"
and other spirits, who had formerly controlled Stainton
Moses. From that time, and especially after tgoo, the
interest of the sittin~s declined, and they offered less
material for the investigator. Another automatic medium,
Helene Smith, came under the observation of Professor
Flournoy. Helene's trance utterances were spoken in the
" :Uartian language," a variant of the " unknown tongue"
of the early ecstatics, and she claimed to be a re-incarnation
of Marie Antoinette and a Hindu princess.
Of the various theories advanced to explain the medium-
istic manifestations the most important is the spiritualistic
explanation, which claims that the phenomena are pro-
duced by the spirits of the dead acting on the sensitive
organism of the medium. 1he evidence for such a theory,
though some investigators of the highest distinction have
found it satisfactory, is nevertheless generally acknowledged
to be inconclusive. Conscious fraud, though it is no ~onger
considered to cover the whole ground, yet plays a definite
part in the phenomena of both '' physical " and trance
mediums, for it has been shown that the latter frequently
collect, through private enquiry agents, information anent
po~sible sitters which is later retailed by the " controls."
The spiritualist's explanation of these lapses into fraud is
that they are instigd.ted by the spirits themselves. And
it does not seem impossible that a genuine medium might
have resort to fraud during a temporary failure of his
psychic powers. Automatism covers a still wider field.
That automatic utterances, writing, drawing, etc., may
be quite involuntary, and without the sphere of the
medium's normal consciousness. is no longer to be doubted
The psychological phenomena. may be met with in small
children, and in private mediums whose good faith is beyond
question, and the state is recognised as being allied to
hypnotism and hysteria. Besides automatism and fraud
there are some other factors to be considered ere the
possibility of transcendental faculties be touched upon.
Medium
On the part of the sitter as-well as of the medir~m some
deception may be practised. It has been sa.id that the
ability to inspire confidence in his sitters is essential to a
successful medium, and if at the same time the sitters be
predisposed to believe in the supernatural nature of the
manifestations, it is easy to imagine a lessening of the
attention and observation so necessary to the investigator.
The impossibility of continued observation for even a short
period is a fact that can only be proved by experiment.
M.,:nory defects and proneness to exaggeration are also
accountable for many of the marvels of the seance-room,
and possible hallucination must be considered. When the
medium is in a trance, with its accompanying hyper~thesia,
unconscious suggestion on the part of the sitters might offer
a rational explanation of so-called " clairvoyance." But
when all these factors are removed the root problems of
mediumship still remain. In the case of Mrs. Piper for
instance, the least that can be said for her trance utterances
is that they were telepathic; that she gathered information
from the minds of her sitters, or through them from other
living minds. To not a few, however, they presented
definite proof of spirit communication. To meet such
instances 1\•
lr. Myers formulated his doctrine of transcen-
dental faculties, crediting the medir~m with clairvoyance
and pre-vision. But no really conclusive test has ever
been complied with. Psychical researchers have left
sealed letters, whose contents arc knovtn only to themselves,
instructing that after their deaths the letters be submitted
to c:. medittm, but in no case have the contents been correctly
revealed. Agaiu, in the case of Eusapia Palladino, Mr.
Myers, Sir Oliver Lodge, and others have inclined to the
belief in a force emanating from the medium herself by
which the physical manifestations are produced. Here,
also, the evidence cannot be considered conclusive. Skilled
and scientific invcstig<\tors have from time to time been
deceived by what has a,ctually proved to be sleight of
hand, and, in fact, the only trustworthy evidence possible
would be that of automatic records.
At the same time the testimony of such distinguished
gentlemen as ProCessor Richet, Sir 0. Lodge, and othe.rs
makes it_ evident that judgment must not be hastily pro·
nounct'd on the medium, but rather·that an earnest endea-
vour be made to solve the problems in that connecti~n.
HeaU"g Mediums.-The diagnosis and cure of diSease
have been extensively practised by spiritualistic mtdiun~,
tollowing in the pathof the oldersomnambulesand magnetic
subjects. These latter were wont not only to trace the
progres~ of their own diseases, but also to diagnose and
to prescribe a mode of treatment. At the outset it was n?t
prescribed for the diseases of those with whom they were m
rapport; and likewise the medi11m, having <:Stablished
yapport between his control and the patient, was influenced
to prescribe a mode of treatment. At the outsetit was not
considered proper for the healing medium to accept any
remuneration for his services, but later healers usually
demanded a. fcc. It is true that healing mediums, like
Christian Scientists, mesmcris~. magnetists, and others,
have effected a. considerable proportion oi bot!a fide cures,
but whether by spirit influence or suggestion is a point on
which there is too much diversity of opinion for it to be
discussed here. It is claimed for many mt'divms that they
have cured diseases of long standing, which were pronounc7d
incurable- heart disease, consumption, cancers, paralysiS,
and many more. Some also have been credited with the
power to heal instantaneou·sly, as did the Cure d'Ars and
othe• miraculous healers. The marvellous potency of the
waters at Lourdes is considered by spiritualists to be the
gift of discarnate beings, having been in the first instance
revealed to a child by her spirit guide, in the form of a.
white angel.

aside his mental body and awakens in his casual body to
the still greater bliss of the higher division of the mental
world. At this stage he bas done with the bodies which
form his mortal personality, and which form his home in
successive incarnations, and he is now truly himself, a
spirit, immortal and unch~ngeable except for increasing
development and evolution. Into his casual body isworked
all that he h~ experienced in his phys1cal, astral and
mental bodies. and when he still finds that experience
insufficient for his needs, he descends again into grosser
matter in order that he may learn yet more and more.
Mephls or Mempbitis : A stone which, when bruised to
powder and drunk in water, causes insensibility to torture.
Mercury : Or quicksilver. A metal which has been known
of for m'l.uy centuries, and which has played an important
part in the history of alchemy. In its refined state it
forms a coherent, very mobile tiquid. The early alchemists
believed that natnre formed all met.als of 1ntYCuYy, and that
it is a. living and feminine principle. It went through
many processes, and the metal evolved was pure or impure
according to the locality of its production.
Mercury of Life : (See Elixir or Life.)
Merlin : An enchanter of Britain who dwelt at the court of
King Arthur. His origin is obscure, but early legends
concerning him agree that he was the offspring of Satan.
He was probably an early Celtic god, who in process of
time came to be regarded as a. great sorcerer. There
appears to have been more than one Meylin, and we must
discriminate between the :\·Icrlin of Arthurian romance and
Merlin Caledonius : but it is probable that originally the
two-conceptions spr:lng from the one idea.
Mesmer, Franz Antoine : An Austrian doctor, born at Wei!
about the year I733· In 1766 he took a degree in medicine
at Vienna, the subject of his inaugural thesis being De
planetarum Influx" (De l'inftuence des Planettes sur le-
c~rps humain). The influence of the planets he identified
wtth magnetism. On seeing the remarkable cures of
G~sne~ he supposed that the magnetic force must also
res1de 1n the human body, and thereupon dispensed v.-ith
magnets. In '.778 he went to ~a1 is v:~erc he was very
favour<_L'I?ly received-by the pubhc, that lS, for the medical
authooties there, as elsewhere, refused to countenance him.
His method was to seat his patients round a large circular
vat or baquet, in which various substances were mixed.
Each patient held one end of an iron rod the other end ol
which was in the baquet In due time 'the crisis ensued.
Violent convulsions, cries, laughter, and vanous physical
symptoms followed, these being 1n turn superseded by
letharg)'· Many claimed to have been healed by this
method. In 1784 the government appointed a commission
of members of the Faculte d4 .'I.Udecine, the Societe Royale
de Medeci11e, and the Academy of Sciences, the commi.ssion-
ers from the latter body including Franklin, Bailly, and
Lavoisier. The report of the Committee stated, in effect,
that there was no such thing as animal magnetism, and
ref~rred the facts of the crisis to the imagination of the
pabent. It ha.d the effect of quenching to a considerable
~xtent the public interest in mesmerism, as animal magnet-
15m was called, for the time a.t leC\st, though it was after-
wards to be revived. JI;J'esmeY died in I8I5.

Metals in Anlmal l\Tagnetism : It is recorded by the magnetists
that the various metals exercised a characteristic influence
on the1r pahents. Physical sensations of beat a.nd cold
nurnbnes~. drowsiness, and so on were experienced by tbe
somnambules on contact with 111etals, or even when metals
were secretly introduced into the room. Dr. Elliotson,
especially, gave much prominence to the alleged power of
metal to transmit the magnetic fluid. Gold, silver, plati-
num, and nickel were good conductors, though the mag-
netism conveyed by the latter was of a highly dangerous
cbal'ar.ter. Copper, tin, pewter, and zir:c were bad con-
ductors. Elliotson found that a magnetised sovereign
would thro'v into the trance his sensitives the sister~ Okev
and that though iron would neutralise the magnetic rO:
perties of the sovereign, no other metal would do so. \\'hen
Baron von Reichenbach propounded his theory of odylic
force his sensitives saw a luminous emanation proceed from
metals-silver and gold shone white ; lead, hlue ; nickle,
red, an~ so on. All these phenomena may be referred to
suggestton.
!lletempsyebosis, or Transmigration : The passing of the soul
at death into another body than the one it bas vacated.
The belief in metempsychosis wa.s very wide-spread in
ancient times, a.nd still survives in J:lrammism and Buddh-
ism, as well as in European folk-tales and superstitions.
The Brahmins and Buddhists believe that the soul may
enter another human body, or that of one of the lower
animals, or even a plant 01· tree, accordtng to its deserts
in the previous incarnation. Thus it is doomed to suc-
cessive incarnations, till by the suppression of all desires
and emotions it loses itself in the Supreme Being. Very
similar was the idea. of Pythagoras and the Greeks, who
believed that all material existence was a punishment for
sins committed in a former incarnation. Indet.-d it is
probable that Pytb.a.goras derived his theory from the
Brahminical doctrine. The ancient Egyptians would also
seem to have believed in metempsychosis. Among certain
savage tribes of Africa and America transmigratwn is
generally subscribed to at the present day. 'J hese sa.Yages
imagine the discarnate spirit very much out of its element
till it has found another body to dwell in, which it does as
Metratton 275
speedily as possible. Totcmism may perhaps facilitate
a belief in the passing of the soul into the body of an
animal. In Europe also in early times the belief in
metempsychosis flourished. and several popular folk-t<>les,
such as that known m Scotland as The Milk-white Doo, of
which variants are found in many lands, contain references
to the souls of the d\}dd entering into beasts, birds, or
fishes. In some places it is thought that witches are
at death transformed into bares, and for this reason the
p~ople of thc;e localities refuse to cat a hare. The jewish
K:lb<llists also believed in the doctrine of metempsychosis,
and traces of it a~e to be found in the writings of Sweden-
borg.
Metratton : According to Jewish r:~obbinical legend, Met-
raUon, the angel, is one of the agents by whom God the
Father woTks. He receives the pure and simple essence of
the divinity and be$tows the gift of life upon <!ll. He
dwells in one of the angelic hierarchies.
Mexico and Central America : Occult science among the
ancient Mexicans may be said to have been in that stage
between the savage simplicities of medicine-men and the
more sophisticated magical practices of the medireval
sorcerer. The sources which inform us regarding it are
unfortunately of a most scanty description and arc chiefly
gleaned from the works of tho early missionaries to the
country, and !rom the legends and myths of the people
themselves. 'Writin~ upon the sorcerers of Mexico, Saha-
gun, an early Spa01sh priest, states that the naualli or
magician among the Mexicans is one who enchants men
and sucks the blood of infants during the night. This
would seem as if the writer had confounded the sorcerer
with the vampire,-a mistake <X:casionally made by con-
tinental writers on magic. lie proceeds to say that among
the Mexicans this class is ignorant of nothing which apper-
tains to sorcery, and possesses great craft and natural
address; that they hire themselves out to people to work
evil upon their enemies, and to cause madness and maladies.
"The necromancer," he says, ''is a person who has made
pact with a demon, and who is capable of transforming
himself .into various animal· shapes. Such people appear
to be t1red of life and await deatll with complaisance.
The astrologer practises among the people as a diviner,
and has a thorough knowledge of the various signs of the
calendar, from which he is able to ~;>rognosticate the for-
t unes of those who employ him. Thts he accomplishes by
weighing the power of one planet against that of another,
and thus discovering the Tesultant applies it to the case in
point. These men were called into consultation at births
and dcath_s. as well as upon public occasions, and .would
d1spute w1th muclt nicety on theiT art." The astrological
system of the Mexicans was like that of their calendar of
the most involved description possible, and no mere sum-
m3.ry of it could convey anything but a hazy notion of the
system, for which the reader is referr<!'d to the author's
Civilisatio't of Ancient Mexico, Sahagun's Historia, and
Bulletin 28 of the United States Bureau ·of Ethnology. In
connection with the astrological science of the Aztecs,
however, it is worthy of note that the seventh calendric
sign, was that under which necromancers, sorcerers and
evil-doers were usually horn. Says Sahagun : " These
work; their enchantments in obscurity for four nights
runnmg, when they choose a certain evil sign. They then
betake themselves in the night to the houses where they
desire to ,:ork their evil deeds and sorceries....... For the
rest the!> sorcerers nevet know contentment, for all their
days.they live evilly and know no peace."
The myths of the :\lexicans give us a good working idea.
of the status of the enchanter or sorcerer in Aztec society.
For ~xample we find that the Toltec god, Quetzalcoatl,
•vho 1n early times was regarded as a description of r.ulture-
Mexico
hero, was bewitched by the god of the incoming and rival
race, Tezcatlipoca, who disgui!.cd himself as a physician
and prescribed for an illt\CSS of his enemy's an enchanted
draught, which made him loug for the country of his
origin-that is, the hon:e of the rains. From this we may
judge that potions or philtres were in vogue amongst
~Jexican sorcerers. In their efforts to rid themselves of
the entire Toltec race, the traditional aborigines of Mexico,
Tezcatlipoca is pictured as performing upon a magical
drum in such a manner as to cause frenzy amongst the
Toltecs, who leaped by thousands into a deep ravine
bard by their city ; and similar instances of the kind are
occasionally to be met with. 'Wonderful stories are told
of the feats of the Huaxteca, a people of l\laya race, dwell-
ing on the Gulf of Mexico. Sahagun relates that they
could produce from space a spring with fishes, burn and
restore a hut, and dismember and resurrect themselves.
The Ocuiltec of the Toluca Valley also possessed a wide-
spread reputation as enchanters and magicians.
Divination and Augury.- As has been said, divination
was practised among the Aztecs by means of astrology ;
but there were other and less-intricate methods in use.
There was in existence a College of Augurs corresponding
in purpose to the Auspices of Ancient Rome, the members
of which occupied themselves with observing the flight and
listening to the songs of birds, from which they drew their
conclusions, and pretended to interpret the speech of all
winged creatures. The Calmecac, or training college of
the priests, had a department where divination was taught
in all its branches. A typical example of augury fTom
birds may be found in the account of the manner in which
the Mexicans fixed upon the spot for the foundation of
t heir city. Halting after years of wandering in the vicinity
of the Lake of 1ezcuco, they observed a great eagle ~~-ith
wings outspread perched on the stump of a cactus, and
holding in its talons a live serpent. Their augurs inter-
preted this as a good omen as it had been previously
announced by an oracle, and upon the spot where the bird
had alighted, they drove the first piles upon which they
afterv;ards built the city of Mexico,-the legend of the
foundation of which is still commemorated in the arms of
modern ,'dexico. Dreams and visions played a great
part in Mexican divination, and a special caste of augurs
called Teopixqui, or Teo:ec11hlli (masters or guardians of
divine things) were set apart for the purpose of interpreting
dreams and of divining through dreams and visions, which
was regarded as the chief route between man and the
supernatural. The senses were even quickened and
sharpened by the use of drugs and the ecstatic condition
was induced by want of sleep, and pertinacious fixing of
the mind upon one subject, the swallov•ing or inhalation
of cerebral intoxicants such as tobacco, the maguey, coca,
the snake-plant or ololiultqt~i, and similar substances. As
among some tribes of the American-Indians, it .was probably
believed that visions came to the prophet or seer pictorially,
or that acts were performed hefore him as in a play. 1hey
also heid that the soul travelled through space and was
able to visit those places of which it desired to have know-
ledge. It is also possible that they hypnotised themselves
by gazing at certain small highly-polished pieces of sand-
stone, or that they employed these for the same purpose as
crystal-gazers employ the globe. The goddess Tozi was
the patron of those who used grains of maize or red beans
in divination.
Charms a11d A mulets.-1'he amulet was regarded in
Me:rico as a personal fetish. The Tepitoton, or diminutive
household deities of the Mexicans were also fetishistic.
It is probable that most of the Mexican amulets were
modelled on the various ornaments of the gods. Thus
t he traveller's staff carved in the shape of a serpent like
Mexico
that of Quetzalcoatl w.\S undoubtedly of this nature, and
was even occ"sionally sacrificed to. The frog was a
favourite model for an amulet. As elsewhere, the thunder-
bolts thrown by the gods were supposed to be flint stones,
and were cherished as amulets of much virtue, and as
symbols of the fecundating rains.
Va:npirism.-As ha3 been seen, Sahagun confounds the
:\lexican necrom'lncer with the vaTllpi~e. and it is inter-
e>ting to note th'lt this !olk-belief must have originated in
Americ'l independently of any Europ~;m connection. But
we find another instance of w:1at would seem something
like vampirism in Mexico. This is found in connection 'nth
the ciupipillin or ghosts of women who have died in child-
birth. These haunt the cross-roads, crying and wailing
for the little ones they have left behind them. But as in
m'lny other countries, notably in Burma, they are malevo-
lent-their evil tendencies probably being caused by
jealousy of the happiness of the living. Lest they should
enter their houses and injure their children, the Mexicans
at certain times of the year stopped up every possible hole
and crevice. The appe1.rMce of these ghosts (Sahagun
describes them as " goddesses ") at cross-roads is highly
significant, for we know that tile buri~l of criminals at such
junctions was merely a survival of a similar disposal of the
corpse of the vampire, whose head was cut off and laid at
his side, and who was entombed at cross-roads for the
purpose of confusing him as to his whereabouts.
Nagualism.-Both in :\Iexico and Central America a
religio-magical system called Nagualism obtained, the
purpose of which W.lS to bring occult influence against the
whites for their destruction. The rites of this strange cult
u•ually took pla·e in caverns and other deserted localities,
and were naturally derived to a large extent from those of
the suppressed native religion. Each native worshipper
possessed a magical or animal spirit-guide, with which he
was endowed e:~.rly in life This system certainly flourished
as lately as half a century ago, and t'lere is good reason
to believe that it is not yet extinct.
Central Am~Yica.-1-lotices upon magic and sorcery
amongst the Maya, Kiche, and other Central American
peoples are even rarer than those which relate to ,Wexico,
and we have to fall back almost solely upon the native
legends to glean anything co:tcerning the subject at all.
Tile ~eat storehouse of Central American legend is the
Popol V~th, for an account of which the reader is referred to
the author's Popol Vuh, London, 1909. We find in this
interesting native mythi-hi~tory, that some of the elder
gods are regarded as magicians, and the hero-twins, Xblan-
que and Hun-abpu. whom they sent to earth to rid it of the
Titan Vukub-cakix, are undoubtedly possessed of magical
P" vers. As boys we find them equipped with magic tools,
which enable them to get through an enormous amount of
work in a single,day, and when they descend into Xibalba,
the Kiche Hades, for the purpose of avenging their father
and uncle, they take full advantage of their magical pro-
pensities in combating the natives of that drear abode.
Xibalb~ itself posse3ses sorcerers, for we find two within its
borders, X11lu and Pacaw, who assist the hero-gods in many
oi their necromantic practices.
As regards divination, we find that the Maya possessed a
C'l.ste of augurs, called Cocomes or the Listeners; and
prophecy appears to have been periodically practised by
their priests. In the so-called books of Chilan Balam which
are native compilations of events occurring in Central
Am~rica previous to the Spanish Conquest, we find ce.-tain
prophecies regarding, amo.1gst other things, the coming
of the Spaniards. These appear to have been given
forth by a priest who bore the title, not the name, of" Chilan
Balam," whose offices were those of divination and astrology
but these pronouncements seem to have been coloured
276 Midiwiwin
at a later date by <-hristian thought, and hardly to be of a
genuine abori!!inal character. There are certain astrolo-
gical receips in the books, all of which are simply borrowed
from European almanacs of the century between 1550
and x6so. Amulets were in p;reat vogue amongst the
Maya, and they bad the same fear of the la~t five days of
the year as had the Mexicans, who regarded them as
nemonlemi or unlucky, and did no work of any description
upon them. These days the Maya called t•yayoyab, and
they considered that a demon entered their towns and
villages at the beginning of this period. To avert this,
they earned an image of him throuj!;h the village in the
hopes that he might afterwards avoid it.
Mezazoth, The : A schedule which, when fastened on the
doorpost, possessed talismanic qualities. It is said in the
Talmud that whoever has the mezazoth fixed on his door, and
is provided with certain personal charms, is protected from
sin.
Michael : An archangel ; in the Hebrew, " He who is equal
to God." In Revelation it is said : " there was war in
heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the
dragon" : and from this it is deduced that Michael was
the leader of the celestial hierarchy,-as afl:\inst Lucifer,
the head of the disobedient angels. Michael is mentioned
by name four other times in the Scriptures ; in Daniel as
the champion of the Jewish Church against Persia ; in
Jude as the archangel who fought with Satan for Moses'
body; by Gabriel he i~ called the prince of the Jewish
Church ; and in the prophecy of Enoch, " Michael. .... who
commands the nations." His design according to Randle
Holme is a banner hanging on ;~. cross ; and he is represented
as victory with a dart in one hand and a cross on his fore-
bead. Bishop Horsley and others considered Michael as
onlv another name for the Son of God. In one of the
Jewish rabbinical legends he is the ruler of Mercury, to
which sphere he " imparts benignity, motion and intelli-
gence, with elegance and consonance of speech."
Michael Medina : (Se& Healing by Touch.)
Microcosm, The : Or the Pentagram, a Little world {Greek
iUicros, small; Kosmos, a world)-a five-pointed star,
which represents Man and the summation of the occult
forces. It was believed by Paracelsus that this sign bad
a marvellous magical power over spirits ; and that all
magic figmes and kabalistic sigr.s could be reduced to
two-The 1\ficrocosm, and the Macrocosm {q.v.).
Microprosopus, The : One of the four magical elements in
the Kabala ; and probably representing one of the four
simple element.~-air. water, earth, or nre. The word
means " creator of the little world."
Mlctlan, the Mexican Hades : (See Hell.)
Mid-day Demons : The ancients frequently made mention of
certain demons who became visible especially towards
mid-day to those with whom they had a pact. They
appeared in the form of men or of beasts, and let tl1emselves
be enclosed in a character, a figure, a vial, or in the interior
of a hollow ring. . . . .
Midiwfwin, The : A secret soctety or exclustve assoctab on
of the Ojibway Indians of North America. The myth of
the found:\tion o! this society is as follows : 1\Iichabo, the
Creator, looking down to eartl1 saw that the forefathers
of the Ojibway were very helpless. . . . Espying a blac_k
object floating on the surface of a lake he drew near to 1t
and saw that it was an otter-now one of the sacred animals
of the Midiwiwin. He instructed it in the mysteries of
that caste, and provided it with a sacred rattle, a sacred
drum, and tobacco. He built a Midiwigan, or -Sacred
House of Midi, to which he took the otter and confided to
it the mysteries of the Midiwiwin. In short, the society
is one of these " medicine " or magical associations so
common among the North-American Indians (q.v.). When
MiUtia 277 Mishna
a candidate is admitted to a grade and is prepared to pass
on to the next, he gives three feasts, and sings three prayers
to the Bear Spirit in order to be permitted to enter that
grade. His p:ogr~ss through the various grad~s is assisted
by several snake-spirits ; and at a later stage by
the po~er of certain prayers or invocations,-a larger
snake appears and raises its body, thus forming an arch
under which the car.didate takes his way to the higher
grade. When the Indian belongs to the second grade he is
supposed to receive supernatural power, to be a~le .to see
into the future, to hcJ.r what co!lles abr off, to touch
friends and foes however far away they may be. and so on.
In hig:1er grades be can assume the form of any animal.
The third grade confers enhanced power, and it is thought
that its members can perform extraordinary exploits, and
have power over the entire invisible world. The fourth
is still more exalted.
When an Indian is ready to undergo initiation, he
erects a wigwam in which he takes steam-baths for four
days, one on each day. On the evening of the day before
initiation he visits his teachers in order to obtain from
them instructions for the following day. Next morning
the priests approach with the candidate at their head, enter
the Midiwigan, and the proceedings commence. Tbe
publications of the Bureau of American Ethnology con-
tain several good accounts of the ritual of this societ y.
Militia Crucifera Evangellea : (See Rosicrucians.)
Mimetic I!laglc : (See Magic.)
Mines, Haunted : 1The belief that mines are haunted is an
ancient and universal one, probably arising from the many
weird sounds and echoes which are heard in them, and the
perpetual gloom. Sometimes the haunting spectres are
gigantic creatures with frightful f1ery eyes. Such was the
German " Bergmonch, a terrible figure in the garb of a
monk, who could, however, appear in ordinary human
shape to those towards whom he was well-disposed."
Frequently weird knockings are heard in the mines. In
Ger.nany these are attributed to the Kobolds, small black
beings of a malicious disposition. White hares or rabbits
are also seen at times. The continual danger attending the
life underground is productive of many supernatural
"warnings," which generally take the form of mysterious
voices. In the Midland Counties of England the " Seven
Whistlers " are well known and their warnings solemnly
attended to. A light blue flame settling on a full coal-tub
was called ·• Bluecap," and his work was to move the coal·
tub towards the trolley-way. Bluccap did not give his
services for nothing. Every fortnight his wages were left
in a corner of the mine, and duly appropriated. A more
mischievous elf was "Cutty Soames," who would cut the
traces, or soams, yoking an assistant putter to the tub.
Basilisks, whose terrible eyes would strike the miner dead,
were another source of dread to the worker underground.
These, as well as the other mysterious foes who dealt fatal
blows, may be traced to the dreaded, but by no means
ghostly, fire-damp. Mines of the precious metals arc still
more jealously guarded by the supernatural beings. Gnomes
the creatures of the earth-element, are the special guardians
of subterranean treasure, and they are not over-anxious
t hat their province be disturbed. JV!ines containing
precious stones arc equally well looked after. The Indians
of Peru declare that evil spirits haunt the emerald mines,
while a mine in the neighbourhood of Los Esmeraldos was
said to be guarded by a frightful dragon. It has also been
shted that the poisonous fumes and gases which ofttimes
destroy the lives of miners are baleful influences radiated
by evil spirits. ·
lllrabllls Liber : The greater part of this book is attributed
to Saint Cesaire. It is a collection of predictions concerning
the saints and the sibyls. It is surprising to find in the
edition of 1522 a prophecy of the French Revolution. The
expulsion and abolition of the nobility, the violent death
of the king and queen, the persecution of the clergy, the
suppression of convents, are all mentioned therein, followed
by a further prophecy that the eagle coming frcm distant
lands would re-establish order in France.
Mlraculum Mundi : (See Glauber.)
Mlrendola, Giacomo Picus da : Italian Astrologer and
Kabalist (1463- 1494). This astrologer's family played a
prominent part in a number of the civil w:ars which con-
vulsed mcdi<Cval Italy, while they owned extensive lands
in the neighbourhood of Modena, the most valuable of their
possessions beinl? a castle bearing their own name of
Mirandola: .and 1t was here, in the year 1463, that G-iacomo
was born. He appears to have been something of an
Admirable Crichton, never showing any fondness for playing
children's games, but devoting himself to study from the
very outset; and, according to tradition, before he was
out of his teens he had mastered jurisprudence and
mathematics, he had waded far into the seas of philosophy
and theology, and had even dabbled in those occult sciences
wherewith his name was destined to be associated after-
wards. A boy of this kind naturally felt small inclination
to remain at home, and so it is not surprising to find that
Giacomo soon left his brothers to look after .the family
estates, and p:-ocecdcd to va_rious universities in Italy and
France. \Vhile in the latter country his interest in astrology
and the like deepened apace, thanks partly to his making a
close study of the works of Raymond Lully ; and in 1486
Giacomo went to Rome, where be delivered a series of
lectures on various branches of science. \Vhile thus
engaged his erudition won high praise from some of his
hearers, but Gertain members of the clergy suspected him
of heresy, reported his doing~ to the Inquisition, and even
sought to have him excommunicated. The pope, however
was of course rather averse to quarrelling with a member
of so powerful a family as the :Mirandolas, and accordingly
he wa1ved violent measures, instead appointing a body
of Churchmen to argue with the scientist. A lengthy
altercation ensued, and throughout it the jury displayed
the most consummate ignorance, it being recorded, indeeds
that some of them imagined that " Kabal" was a man,
who had wtitten against Christianity, and that the Kaba-
lists were the disciples of this hypothetic person. C"riawmo
must have been deeply chagrined by this stupidity on the
part of his opponents, he must have felt that to argue with
such people was utterly vain ; yet he published a defence of
the ideas and theories promulgated in his lectures, and in
1493 the pope, Alexander VI., brought the affair to a con·
elusion by gra1iting the offender absolution. Thereupon
lv!irandole went to live at Florence, and here he stayed
until his demise in 1494, occasionally essaying alchemy,
but chiefly busy with further ka.balistic studies.
Apart from the Apologia Pici Mirandoli cited above,
Giacomo was author of several books of a theological
nature, the most important of these being his Conclusiones
Philosophic(B, cabalistic(B et tlleologic(B, published in 1486,
and hi~ Disputationts adversus Astrologiam Divinaticum,
issued in 1495. His works appear to have been keenly
admired by such of his contemporaries as were not averse
to speculative thought, anu it is interesting to find that a
collected edition of his writings was printed at Boulogne in
1496, and another :o.t Venice two years later.

Mobanes : Shamans or medicine-men of the Indians of the
Peruvian Andes. Joseph Skinner writing of them in his
State of Peru, London t8o5, says: "These admit an evil
being, the inhabitant or the centre of the earth, whom they
consider as the author of their misfortunes, and at the
mention of whose name they tremble. The most shrewd
among them take advantage of this belief, to obtain
respect; and represent themS'elves as his delegates. Under
the denomination of J
'1ohanes, or Agoreros, they are con-
sulted even on the most trivial occasions. They preside
over the intrigues of love, the health of the community, and
the taking of the field. Whatever repeatedly occurs to
defeat their prognostiCS, falls on themselves; and they
arc wont to pay their deceptions very deady. They chew
a species of vegetable called puripiri, and throw it into the
air, accompanying this act by certain recitals and incan-
tations, to injure some, to benefit others, to procure rain,
and the inundation of the rivers, or, on the other hand, to
occasion settled weather, and a plentiful store of agricul·
tural productions. Any such result having been casually
verified on a single OCC:\~ion, suffices to confirm the Indians
in their faith, although they may have been cheated a
thousand times. Fully persuaded that they cannot
resist the influence of the puripiri, as soon as they know
that they have been solicited by its means. they fix their
eyes on the impassioned object, and discover a thousand
amiable traits, either real "Or fanciful, which indifference
had before concealed from thetr view.
·• But the principal power, efficacy, and, it may be said
misfortune, of the Mohanu, consist in the cure of the sick.
Every malady is ascribed to their enchantments, and means
are instantly taken to ascertain by whom the mischief may
have been wrought. For this purpose the nearest relative
takes a quantity of the juice of floripondium, and suddenly
falls, intoxicated by the violence of the plant. He is
placed in a fit posture to prevent suffocation, and on his
coming to himself, at the end of three days, the Mohan who
has the gre.."\test resembhnce to the sorcerer he saw in his
vi~ions, is to undertake the cure, or if, in the interim, the
sick man has perished, it is customary to subject him to the
same fate. \'Vhen not any sorcerer occurs in the visions,
the first Mohan they encounter has the misfortune to
represent his image."
Methods of Medicine .'W'en.-It cannot be denied, that the
Moilanes have, by practice and tradition, acquired a pro-
found knowledge of many plants and poisons, with which
they effect surprising cures on the one hand, and do much
mischief on the other ; but the mania of ascribing the
whole to a preternatural virtue, occasions them to blend
with their practice a thousand charms and superstitions.
The m<l!>t customary method of cure is to place two ham-
mocks close to each other, either in the dwelling, or in the
open air : in one of them the patient lies extended, and in
the other the Mohan, or Agorero. The latter, in contact
with the sick man, begins by r9cking him3elf, and then
proceeds by a strain in falsetto, to call on the birds, quad-
rupeds. and fishes, to give health to the patient. From
time to time he rises on his seat, and makes a thousand
extravagant gestures over the sick man, to whom he
applies his powders and herbs, or sucks the wounded or
diseased parts. If the malady augments, the Agorero,
having been joined by many of the people, chants a short
hymn, addressed to the soul of the patient, with this
burden: " Thou must not go, thou must not go.'' In
rep~ating this he. is j~ined by the people, !!"til at length a
temble clamour IS ra1sed, and augmented 10 proportion as
the sick man becomes still fainter and fainter, to the end
that it may reach his ears.

Monaclello, The: The l\1onaciello or Little Monk seems to
have lived exclusively in that portion of Southern Italy
called ~aples. The precise place where he dwelt does not
appear to be accurately known, but it is supposed to have
been in the remains of Abbeys and :Monasteries. When the
Monaciello appeared to mortals, it was always at the dead
of night ; and then only to those who were in sorest need,
who themselves had done all that mortal could do to pre-
vent or allevhte the distress that had befallen them, and
after all humain aid had failed. Then it was that the
Monk appeared, and mutely beckoning them to follow, he
led them to where treasure was concealed-stipulating no
conditions for its expenditure, . demanding no promise of
repayment, exacting no duty or service in return. Men
have vainly asked, was it actual treasure he ga.,e, or did it
merely appear so to the external senses, to be changed
into leaves or stones when the day and the occasion o! its
requirement had passed ? And if actual trcasur(", how
did it come in the place of its concealment, and by whom
was it there deposited?
In Germany, the wood-spirit Rubezahl performed similar
acts of beneficence and kindness to poor and deserving,
persons and the money he gave proved to be, or passed for
the current coin of the realm ; while in Ireland, the
O'Donoghue, who dwelt beneath the waters of an inlar.d
lake, and rode over its surface on a steed white as the foam
of its waves, distributed treasures that proved genuine to
the good, but spurious to the undeserving.
Monad is a tl)eosophical term which literally means a umt
(Greek Monas). The Monad is frequently described as a
" Divine Spark," and this impression is particularly apt,
for it is a part of the Logos, the Divine Fire. The Logos
has three aspects, Will, Wisdom and Activity, and, since
the 1lfonad is part of the Logos, it also has these three aspects
It abides continually in its appropriate world, the monadic,
but, that the divine evolutionary purposes may be carried
out, its ray is borne downwards through the various spheres
of matter when the outpouring of the third life wave takes
place. It first passes into the Spiritual Sphere by clcthing
itself with an atom of spiritual matter and thus manifests
itseU in an atomic body, as a spirit possessing three aspects.
When it passes into the next sphere, the Intuitional, it
leaves its aspect of Will behind and in the Intuitional
Sphere, appears in an Intuitional body as a spirit possessing
the aspects of Wisdom and Activity. On passing in turn,
from this sphere to the next the higher mental, it leaves the
aspect of Vi'isdom behind. and appears in a casual body as a
spirit posse~~ing the aspect of activity. To put this some-
what abstruse doctrine in another form, the Monad has,
at this stage, manifested itself in three spheres. In the
spiritual it has transfused spirit with Will, in the Intuitional
it has transfused spirit with Wi~dom, and in the higher
Mental it has transfused spirit with Activity or Intellect,
and it is now a human ego, correspOnding approximately
to the common term "soul," an ego which, despite all
changes, remains the same until eventually the evolution-
ary purpose is fulfilled and it is received back again into the
Logos. From the higher mental sphere the Monad desc~nds
to the lower mental sphere and appears in a mental body as
pos.~essing mind, then betakes itself to the astral sphere
and appears in the astral body as possess;ing emotions, and
finally to the hhysical sphere and appears in a physical
body as possessing vitality. These three lower bodies, the
Monen 279 Morien
mental, the astral, and the physical, constitute the human
personality which dies at death and is renewed when the
.Uonad, in fulfilment of the process of reincarnation, again
manifests itself in these bodies. (See Theosophy, Evolution,
Sphere, Life Waves, Monadic Sphere, Logos.)
Monen : A Kabalistic term covering that branch of magic
which deals with the reading of the future by the computa-
tion of time and obsP.rvancc of the hcavenlv bodies. It
thus includes astrology. •
Money : Mo11ey which comes from the devil is of poor qu'llity,
and such wealth, like the fairy-money, generally turns to
earth. or to lead. toads. or anything else worthless or
repulsive. " A youth," says Gregory of Tours, ·• received
a piece of folded paper from a stranger, who told him that
he could get from it as much mo11ey as he wished, so long
as he did not unfold it. ·rhe youth drew many gold pieces
from the papers. but at length curiosity overcame him, he
unfolded it and discovered within the claws of a cat and a
bear, the feet of a load and other repulsive fragments,
while at the same moment his wealth dtsappeared." In
popular superstition it is supposed that if a person hear the
cuckoo for the first time with money in his pocket, he shall
have some all the year, while if he greet the new moon for
the first time in the same foctunate condition, he shall not
lack money throughout t he month.

Mopses, The : A socrct association imported into Germany,
which celebrated the rites of the gnostic Sabbath. It
replaced the Kabalistic " goat " by the Hermetic '· dog "
as an object of worship. The candidate for the ordt:r was
brought into the circle of adepts with the eyes bandaged
in the midst of a great uproar, and after saluting the idol
was initiated. The sign of recognition was a grimace.
Tho whnle doctrine of the society was that of black magic.
The iltopses recruited only among Catholics, and for the
oath at reception they substituted a solemn engagement on
honour to reveal no secrets of the ordcr,-the practices of
which much resembled the Sabbath of mcdi.eval sorcerers.
Morelle, Paolo : (Ste Italy.)
Morgan, Professor De : (See Spiritualism.)
Morgan le Fay : Sister of Arthur and wife of King Urien of
Gore. Arthur gave into her keeping the scabbard of his
sword Excalibur, but !>he gave it to Sir Accolon whom she
loved and had a forged s<'abbard made. Arthur, however,
recovered the real sheath, but was again deceived by her.
She figures as a Queen of the Land of Faerie and as such
appears in French and Italian romance. It was she who,
on one occasion, threw Excalibur into a. lake. She usually
presents her favourites with a ring and retains them by her
side as does Venus in Tannhallst:r. Her myth is a parallel
of that of Eos and Tithonus and is probably derived from
a sun and dawn myth.
Morien : It is commonly supposed that N[orle>l, or Morienus
as he is sometimes styled, wa~ born at Rome in th<' twelfth
century, and it is also reported that, bke Raymond Lully
and several other early chymists, he combined evangelical
ardour with his scientific tastes. While still a mere bov,
and resident in his native city, Morien became acquaint~
with the writings of Adfar, tht: Arabian philosopher, and
~radually the youth's acquaintance with these developed
..1nto tense admiration, the result being that he became
filled with the desire to make the personal acquaintance of
the author in question. Accordtngly tic bade adieu to
Rome and ~et out for Alexandria, this being the horre of
Adfar ; and. on reaching his destination, he had not to wait
long ere gaining his desired end. The h~a.rned Arabian
accorded him a hearty welcome, and a littlt: while after-
wards the two were living together on very friendly terms,
the elder man daily imparting knowledge to the younger.
who showed himself a remarkably apt pupil. For some
years this state of affairs continued, but at length Adfar
died, and thereupon Morien left Alexandria and went to
Palestine, found a retreat in the vicinity of Jerusalem, and
began to lead a hermit's life there.
Meanwhile the erudition of the deceased Arabian acquired
a wide celebrity, anc\ some or his manuscripts chanced to
fall into the hands ol Kalid, Soldan of Egypt. He \\as a
person of active and enquirin~ mind, and observing that.
on the cover of the manuscrtpts, it was stated that the
secret of the philosopher's stone was written within, he
naturally grew doubly inquisitive. He found, however,
that he himself could not elucidate the preciou5 documents ;
and therefore he summoned illu.ni11ati from far and near
to his court at Cairo, and offered a large reward to the
man who should discover the mystery at issue. An endless
number of people presented themselves in consequence, but
the majority of them were mere charlatans, and thus the
Soldan was duped mercilessly.
Betimes news of these doings reached the ears of Jl1oriell.
It incensed him to think that hts old preceptor's wisdom
aud writings were being made a laughing-stock, so he
decided that he must go to Cairo himself, and not only see
justice done to Adfar's memory, but also 5cizc what might
prove a favourable opportunity of converting Kalid to
Christianity. The Soldan was inclined to be cynical when
the hermit arrived, nor would he listen to tltc latter's
attacks on the Mahommedan faith ; yet he saw fit to
grant Morien a house wherein to conduct researches, and
here the alchemist worked for a long time, ultimately per-
fecting the elixir. He did not, withal, make any attempt
to gain the proferrcd reward ; and instead he took his
leave without the Soldan's cognizance, simply leaving the
precious fluid in a vase on which he inscribed the suggestive
word!;: " He "ho possess all hao; no need of others."
But Kalid was at a loss to know how to proceed further,
and for a long time he made great efforts to find .Morien
and bring him again to his court. Years went by, and all
search for the vanished alchemist proved vain ; but once,
when the Soldan w~ hunting in the neighbourhood of
Jerusalem, one of his SE."rvants cJ,anced to hear of a hermit
\\hO was wont to create gold. Convinced that this must be
none other than Mnriet1, Kalid straightway sought him
out ; so once more the two met, and again the alchemLo;t
made !;trenuous cffor~ to win the other from Mahomme-
danism. Many discussions took place between the pair,
both sp¢i!.king on behalf of their respective religions, yet
Kalid showed no inclination to desert the faith of l1is
fathers. And therefore llllorien relinquished the qut-st in
despair, but it is said that, on parting with the Soldan, he
duly instructed Him in the mysteries of the transcendent
science.
Nothing ·is known about 111orien's subsequent history,
and the likelihood is that the rest of his days were spent
q01etly at his hermitage. He is credited with sundry
alchcmistic writings, said to have been translated from
Arabic, hut it need hardly be saiti that the ascription rests
on the slenderest evidence. Ont: of these works is entitled
Liber de Distinctione ilter&urii Aquarum, and it is intcr-;:sting
to recall thai a manuscript copy thereof belonged to Robert
Boyle, one or the founders of the Royal Society ; while
another is entitled Liber de Composilione Alchemia, and
this is printed in the first volume of Bibliotheca Chemica
Curiosa. Yet better known than either of these, and
more likely to be really from Morien's pen, is a t~d
treatise styled De Re /11etalli&a, Metallorum TYamumtat:om,
et occulta summague A11liquomm JUedicine l.ibellus, which
Morrell 280 Muscle-Reading'
was repeatedly published, the first edition appearing at

a high order. and delivered numerou& eloquent discourses

Moses, Rev. William Stalnton : One of the best known
mediums connected with modem spiritualism, and probably,
after Home. one of the most successful. He was bom in
1839, at Donington, in Lincolnshire. the son of a school-
master, and was edu~ted at Bedford Grammar School and
Exeter College, Oxford. He made good progress at the
University, but before his final examination his health
broke down, and he was forced to go abroad. On his
return he graduated 1taster of Arts, and in 1863 was
ordained. From that time until 1870 he was a curate,
first in the Isle of Man and afterwards in Dorsetshire.
Again his health gave way, and he was obliged to abandon
parish work, and seck a change of occupation. In 1870
he became tutor to the son of Dr. and Mrs. Stanhope Speer,
with whom he resided. and who were henceforth among his
staunchest supporters. A year or two later he was appointed
English master in University College School, but increasing
ill-health compelled h1m to retire in 1899. Towards the
close of his life Mr. Moses suffered greatly from depression
and kindred nervous disorders. His life as a clergyman
and as a schoolmaster was beyond reproach, and his duties
were dJ.scharged in a way that won respect alike for his
intelligence and efficiency.
His attention was first directed to spiritualism by the
readmg of R. Dale Owen's book on The Debatable Land,
in 1872. He attended numerous seanus, held by such
mediums as Home, and soon afterwards he himself devel-
oped powerful mediumistic tendencies, and gave seances
to the Speers and a few select friends. The best accounts
of his s1ttings are those written by Dr. and :\Irs. Speers
who kept separate records of the performances, and there
are occasional accounts by others who were admitted to the
circle. The phenomena were at first confined to raps and
levitations of furniture, but gradually the manifestations
became more varied and more pronounced. Toilet articles
in M..,. Moses' room moved about of themselves and formed
a cross on his bed, ·• apports " of perfume, pincushions,
pearls, and other articles were brought by the spirits, and
the medium himself would lloat about the room. Towards
the end of the year " spirit lights ·• began to make their
appearance, and seem to have created a profound impression
on the sitters, though to judge from the descriptions they
give, it would seem that 1\!r. Podmore's explanation of
" bottles of phosphorus" is not far from the truth.
Musical instruments also were heard playing in the air,
besides raps, thuds. and other noises.
Perhaps his most im~ortant manifestations, however,
were the automatic wrihngs published under the title of
Spirit Teachings. These purported to come from several
spirits, " Imperator," " Rector," and others, and were
mostly of a theological caste. Though of a high ethical
tendency, they evinced a deJ>arture from Christianity, and
suggested the religion of sp1ritualism as the only rational
human creed. Unlike many automatic writings Mr.
Jl!oses' productions were not written in extravagantly
h1gh:llown language, nor wer~ they altogether meaningless.
But 1t must ·be remc-mbered that he was a man of education
and not likely to fall into such errors.
Other worlC done by him in connection with Spiritualism
was his assistance in the !ound.ing of the British National
Association of Spiritualism, and to serve on the Councils of
the Psychological Society, and the Society for Psychical
Research. lie severed his connection with the latter body,
however, because of the position they took up with regard
to certain professional mediums. He was also president
of the London Spiritual Alliance from 1884 onwards.
Among his most popular works, besides Spirit Teachings.
were Psychography, SpiYit Itkntity, and The Higher Asp~ds
of Spiritualism.
"'by did Stainton Mos•s become a medium ? There are-
few questions more puzzling than this to the student of
spiritual psychology. That professional mediums, and
those private mediums who have anything to gain by their
performances, should carry on deception from year to year,
is comprehensible. But that a clergyman, who had hitherto
led an uneventful and exemplary life, should deliberately
and systematically practise a series of puerile tricks for the
purpose of mystifying hi~ friends, is certainly not so. We
are forced to admit. then. either that his observers were
victims to h:\llucination and self-deception, or that the
phenomena he produced were genuine manifestations from
the spirit-world.
Moss-Woman The : The Moss or Wood Folk, dwelt in the
forests of Southern Germany. Their stature was small and
their form strange and uncouth, hearing a strong resem-
blance to certain trees ·with which they flourished and
decayed. They were a simple, timid, and inoffensive
race, and had little intercourse with mankind ; approach-
ing only at rare intervals the lonely cabin of the wood-man
or' forester, to borrow some article of domestic use, or to
beg a little of the food which the good wife was preparing
for the family meal. They would also for similar purposes
appear to labourers in the f1elds which lay on the outskirts
of the forests. A loan or gift to the 1\loss-people was
always repaid manifold. But the most highly-prized and
eagerly-coveted of all mortal ~ifts was a draught from the
maternal breast to their own little ones ; for this they held
to be a sovereign remedy for all the ills to which their
natures were suhject. Yet was it only in the extremity of
danger that they could so overcome their natural diffidence-
and timidity as to ask this boon-for they knew that mortal
mothers turned from such nur:~lings with disgust and fear.
It would appear that the Moss or Wood folk also lived in
some parts of Scandinavia. Thus we are told that in the
churchyard of Store Hedding, in Zealand. there are the-
remains of an oak wood which were trees by day and
warriors by night.
Mountain Cove Community, The : A spiritualistic community
founded in Mountain Ccue, Fayette Co., Virginia, in the
autumn of t851, under the leadership of the Rev. James
Scott and the Rev. T. L. Harris. Both mediums had
settled in Auburn in the previous year, and had obtained
a considerable following. While Harris was absent in
New York the command to form a comm11nity at il!ountain
Cove was given through the mediumship of Scott, and
about a hundred person~ accompanied him to Virginia.
The members were obliged to deliver up all their possessions,
again at the command of the spirits. Dissensions arose and
pecuniary difficulties were experienced, and only t he advent
ofT. L. Harris in the summer of 1852 saved the community
from dissolution. However. the dissensions and difficulties.
remained, and early in 1853 the community finally broke up.
Muscle-reading : The concentration of thought on any particu-
-lar object produces a tendency to muscular activity. Thus
if a name be thought of the musclt>s of the larynx may
range themseh·es as if for the pronunciation of that name.
This is known as " subconscious whispering." Or there-
may be an unconscious movement towards the object in.
the mind. It is the interpretation of these involuntary-
Myers 281 Mysteries
movements by a second person, or percipient, that fre-
quently passes for genuine telepathy. The thought-
reading exhibited on the public platform, when it is not the
result of fraud, may be in reality muscle-reading. The act
of re:J.ding these slight muscular indications of the thoughts
may be unconscious or instinctive-indeed, must be so, since
they are much too fine to be perceived by the grosser
consciousness.
Myers, Frederic WIUiam Henry (1843-1901) : Poet, essayist,
and student of psychic science, was born at Ke:s~'·ick,
Cumberland, and educated at Cheltenham and Cambridge.
In 1865 he became classical lecturer there, but in 1872
abandoned this poH for that of school inspector. He
published several volumes of poems and essays, some of the
former of considerable beauty, though it is chiP.fiy as an
essayist that he is known. He has done excellent work in
the region of psychic science, being one of the original
group who founded the Society for Psychical Research in
1882, and remaining to the end of his life one of its most
useful members. Though he did not belong to the sceptical
school of which Mr. F. Podmorc is the chief representative,
Mr. Jlfyers' view-point was decidedly not that of the
average spiritualist. The evidence for the survival of the
soul after death he found not in the somewhat puerile
" spirit " manifestations, but in the sublimi"al Co>lscioucS-
1tess, that wide region that lies beneath the ~hreshold-of
man's or~inary consciousness,-wherein ·11fr-:-Myers believed
--to- dlscet'n traces of unused faculties, clairvoyance, retro-
cognition, precognition, telekinesia, and so on. All the
phenomena of trance, hypnotism, automatism, and
spiritualism he ~rouped together as phenomena of the
subliminal consczousness. :rhe results of his researches
were embodied in a posthumous work entitled Human
Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death (1903). He
also wrote the introduction to Gurney's Phantasms of the
Livinf. He died at Rome in IC}OI and was buried at
Keswtck.
Myom'lncy was a method of divination by rats or mice and is
supposed to be alluded to in Isaiah lxvi., 17. Their
peculiar cries, or some marked devastation committed by
them, was taken for a prognostic of evil. lElian relates
that Fabius Maxi.mus resigned the dictatorship in conse-
quence of a warning !rom these creatures ; and Cassius
Flaminius, according to Varro, retired from the command
o! the cavalry for no greater reason. From Herodotus we
learn that the army of Sennacherib, when he invaded Egypt
was infest('d by mice in the night, and their quivers and
bows gnawed in pieces ; in the morning, therefore, being
without arms, they fled in confusion, and many of them
were slain. Such a foreboding o! evil could not very well
be questioned, or its consequences averted, by the com-
mander, but very different was the case when one o! Cato's
soldi.crs told him in affri$ht that the rats had gnawed one
of hz
s shoes. Cato rephed that the prOdigy would have
been much grea.ter if the shoe had gnawed a rat! Hor-
apollo in his curious work on the Hieroglyphics of Egypt,
describes the rat as a symbol of destruction, and, what is
more to our purpose, the Hebrew name of this animal is
from. a root which signifies to separate, divide, or judge;
and 1t has been remarked by one of the commentators on
Horapollo that tbe mouse has n finely discriminating taste.
An . Egyptian 1'115. in the ·• Biblioth~ue Royale " at
Pans, ~ntains the representation of a soul going to judg-
ment, m which one of the figures is depicted with the head
ol a rat and the well-known wig. It is understood that the
Lybian rats and the mouse o! Scripture are the same as the
Arabi;~njerboa, which is characterised by a long tail, bushy
at the end, and short fore-legs. The mice and emerods
of gold, I. Sam. v., 6, 7, were essentially charms having a
p recise symbolic meaning.
Mysteries : From the Greek work mueitz, to shut the mouth,
and mttsles an initiate : a term for what is secret or con-
cealed. Although certain mysteries were undoubtedly
part of the initiatory ceremony of the priests of ancient
Egypt, we are ignorant of their exact trend, and the term
is usually used in connection with certain semi-religious
ceremonies held by various cults in ancient Greece. The
mysteries were indeed secret cults, to which only certain
initiated people were admitted Olfter a period of preliminary
preparation. After this initial period of purification camo
the mystic communication or exhort.ation, then the revela-
tion to the neophyte of certain holy things, the crowning
v:ith the garlands, and lastly the communion with the deity.
But the mysteries appear to have circled round the semi-
dramatic representatzon or mystery-play of the life of a
deity.
It has often been advanced as a likely theory to account
lor the prevalence of these mystic cults in Greece, that they
are of pre-Hellenic origin, and that the Pelasgic aboriginal
people of the countrystrove to conceal their religions from the
the eyes of their conquerors. But against this has to be
weighed the evidence that !or the most part the highet
offices of these cults were in the hands of aristocrats, who,
it may be reasonably inferred, had but little to do with the
inferior strata of the population which represented the
..Pelasgic peop,les. Again, the divinities worshipped in the
mysteries possess for the most part Greek names, and many
of them are certainly gods evolved upon Hellenic soil at a
comparatively late period. We find a number of them
associated with the realm of the dead. The earth-god or
goddess is in most countries often allied with the powers
of darkness. It is from the underworld that gtain arises,
and therefore we are not surprised to find that Demeter,
Ge, and Aglauros, are identified with the underworld.
But there were also the mysteries of Artemis, of Hecate,
and the Cherites,-some of which may be regarded as
forms of the great earth-mother.
The worships of Dionyllus, Trophoniou>, and Zagreus
were also of a mysterious nature. The Eleusinian and
Orphic mysten'es are undoubtedly those of most importance
to the occult student; and froro the results of arch;eology,
such as vase-painting and so forth, we have been able to
glea.n some general idea of the trend of these. That is not
to say that the heart of the mystery is revealed to us by
any suc.h illustrations, but these supplemented by what the
Christian fathers were able to glean regarding these mystic
cults, enable us to push our inve.'ltigations in the proper
quarters. Important as such matter is, however, it is
extremely slight in character.
Eleusis.-The mysteries of Eleusis had for their primal
adoration Demeter, Kore or Persephone,-the mother
and the daughter-whose myth is too well-lmown to
require repetition here. Pluto, the third figure in t he
drama is so unimportant as to be relegated to the back-
ground. Other "nameless" divinities appear to have
been associated with these, under the name of " the gods "
and " the goddesses " ; but the theory that those are
supposed to descend from an aboriginal period, when gods
were nameless, is too absurd for discussion. The nameless
god is of no value to anyone, not even a savage, and a
mere nodding acquaintance with mythological science is
surely sufficient to show that such nameless gods arc merely
those whose higher names arc hidden and unspoken. In
Egypt, for example, the concept of the Concealed Name
was extremely common. The •· name of power" of a
god, if discovered, bestowed on the discoverer sway over
that deity, and we must therefore dismiss the idea of the
nameless divinitiM of Eleusis as not in accordance with
mythological fact. A more probable view is that which
would make these gods later titles of the married pair
Mysteries 282
Pluto and Kore ; but this, in view of the facts just stated,
is also unlikely. Dionysus is also a figure of some import-
ance in the Eleusinian mystery, and it has been thought
that Orplaic influence brought about his presence in the
cult; but traces of Orphic doctrine have not been d~­
covercd in what is known of the mysteries. A more baffling
personality in the .great ritual drama is that of lacchus,
who appears to be none other than Dionvsus under another
name. But Dionysus or lacchus docs not appear to be a
primary figure of the mystery.
\Ve find in early Greek legends allusions to the sacred
character of the Eleusinian mysteries. From the fifth
century their organisation was in the hands of the Athenian
city,-the royal ruler of which undertook the general
management, along with a committee of supervision. The
rites took place at the city of Eleusis, and were celebrated
by a hereditary priesthood, the Eumolpedie. They alone,
or rather their high priest, could penetrate into the inner·
most holy of holies ; but there were also pnestesses and
fcm'\le attend:mts on the goddesses.
1'he celebrMion of the mysteries, so far as can be gleaned,
was somewhat as follows : In the month of September, the
Eleusinian Holy Thin~s were taken !rom the sacred city to
Athens, and placed m the Eleusinion. These probably
consisted to some extent of small statues of the goddesses.
Three days afterwards the catechumens assembled to
hearken to the exhortation of one of the priests, in which
those who were for any reason unworthy of initiation were
solemnly warned to depart. All must be Greeks or Romans
above a certain age, and women and even slaves were
admitted ; but foreigners and criminals might not partake.
The candidates were que~tioncd as to their purification, and
especially as regards the food which they had eaten during
that period. After this assembly, they betook themselves
to the sea-shore and bathed in the sea, being sprinkled
afterwards with the blood of pigs. A sacrifice was offered
up, and several days afterwards the great Eleusinian pro-
cession commenced its journey along the sacred way, its
central figure being a statue of Iacchus. ){any shrines
\vcre visited on the way to Eleusis, where, upon their
arrival, they celebrated a midnight orgy.
It is difficult to come at what occurred in the inner circle ;
but there appear to have been two grades in the celebration,
and we know that a year elapsed before a person who had
achieved one grade became lit for election to the higher.
Regarding- the actual ritual in the ball of mystery, a great
deal of controversy has taken place, but it is certain that
a dramatic representation was the central point of interest,
the chief characters in which were probably Demeter and
Korc, and that the myth of the lost daughter and the
sorrowing mother was enacted before a highly-impressed
audience. It has been stated that the birth of lacchus was
announced during the ceremony; but this has not been
handed down to us on good authority. Of scenic display,
there was probably little or none, as excavation has proved
that there was not room for it, and we find nothing re~ard­
ing scenery in the accounts presented in many inscriptions ;
but the apparel of the actors was probably most magnificent,
and was heightened by the Rembrandtesque effect of gloom
and torchlight.
But certain sacred symbols were also displayed before
the eyes of the elect. These appt>.ar to have been small
idols of the goddesses, of great antiquity and sanctity.
We know that the original symbols of deity are jealously
guarded by many savage priesthoods. For example, the
Uapes of Brazil keep careful watch over the symbols of
Jurupari, their god, and these are shown only to the initia-
ted-any woman who casts eyes on them being instantly
poisoned. It is also stated by Hippolytus that the ancients
were shown a cut corn stalk, the symbol of l),.meter and
Mysteries
Kore. This, however, can hardly be trusted any more
than the theory that the Eleusinians worshipped the
actual corn as a clan totem. Corn as a totem is not un-
known elsewhere, as for example in Peru, where the cco11opa
or godlings of the maize fields were probably originally
totemic; and we know that amongst savage people totem-
ism often carries in its train the concept of the fnll-fiedged
mystery. But i..f the Elcusinian corn was a totem, it was
certainly the only corn totem known to Greece, and corn
totems are rare. The totem has usually initiated with the
hunting condition of man : when he arrives at the agricul-
tural stage we ~cnerally find that a fresh pantheon has
slowly evolved, m which full-fledged gods took the place
of the old totemic deities. The corn appears to him as a
living thing. It is growth, and within 1t resides a spirit.
Therefore the deity which is evolved from this 'concept is
more likely to be of animistic than of totemistic origin.
The neophyte was then made one with the deity, by
partaking of holy food or drink. It will be recalled that
when Persephone reached the datk ~hores of Hades she
partook of the food of the dead-thus rendering it im-
possible for her to return. Once the human soul eats or
drinks in Hades, it may not return to earth. This belief is
universal, and it is highly probable that it was symbolised
in the Eleusinian mysleYics. There was nothing, however,
particularly secret about this sacrament, as it is painted
on many vases which have been brought to light. A great
deal of the ritual undoubtedly partook of the character of
agricultural magic,-a description of sympathetic sorcery.
Among barbarians the medicine-nian sprinkles water
over the soil to incite the rain-spirit fo do likewise. It is
not long ago since, in the Isle of Mull, a long carved stone
in a certain churchyard was filled with v.-ater. until thf
depressions upon it over.flowed, to symbolise a well-watered
country. All sorts of imitative rites took place on similar
occasions-most of which will be familiar to students o£
folklore. It has bee!) thought that the token of the grow-
ing corn?may have served as an emblem of man's resurrec-
tion, and the fact that most persons apP.roach the Eleu-
sinian mysteries for the purpose of ensuring themsolves a
happy immortality would go far to prove this. M. Foucart
has ingeniously put forward the theory that the object of
the Eleusinian mysteries was much the same as that of the
Egyptian Book of the Dtad,-to provide the initiates with
elaborate rules for avoiding the dangers of the under-
world, and to instruct them in the necessary magical
formul:e. But it docs not appear than any such purpose
was attained in the tnysteries; and we know of no magic
formula: recited in connection with them. Friendship
with the Holy Mother and Daughter was to the Eleusinian
votary the chief assurance of immortality.
A great many offshoots of the Eleusinian cult were
established in several parts of Greece.
Dionysiac.-The most important cult next to the Eleu-
sinian was the Orphic, which probably arose in Phrrgia,
and which cau1e to be associated with the name of Dion-
ysus, originally a god of vegetation, who was of course also
a divinity of the nether world. In this case, it was also
desired to enter into communion with him, that immortality
might be assured. His celebrations 'vcre marked by orKies
of a bacchic description, in which it was thought that the
neophyte partook for the nonce of the character and th e
power of the deity himself. The rites of the cult of Diony-
sus were on a much lower grade than those of Eleusis. and
partook more of the barbarian element, and the devouring
of an animal Vlctim was supposed to symbolise the incar-
nation, death and resurrection of the divinity. Later the
Dionysiac mysteries became purified, but always retained
something of their earlier hysteric character. The cult
possessed a fairly wide propaganda, and does not appear
Mysteries 283 .Mysticism
to have been regarded by the sages of its time with great
friendliness. The golden tablets relating to the Orphic
mystery found in tombs in Greece, Grete and Italy, contain·
fraa~cnts of a s.acrcd hymn. As early as the third century
B.C. 1t was bun ed with the dead as an amulet to protect
him from the dangers of the underworld, and the fragments
bear upon them incantations of a magical character.
Atti.s and Sybelt - These mysttries arrived at a rater
period on Hellenic soil. Passionate and violent in the
extreme, they yet gained considerable sway in a more
degenerate age, a.nd communion with the deity was usually
attained by bathing in blood in the taurob.olit~m or by the
letting of blood.
These Phrygian mvst~riu were full of the conception of
the re-birth of the god Attis, who .,.as also of an agrarian
character ; and in brief it may be said of these mystic
cults as a whole that they were primarily barbarian agricul-
tural rites to some extent intcllcctualised.
ll!ithraic Myslt ries.- The Mithraic cult was of Persian
origin, Mithra, a personification of Light being worship~ed
in that country some five hundred years before the Christian
era. Carried into Asia Minor by small colonies of magi,
it was largely influenced by the religions with which it was
brought into contact. Chaldean Astrology contributed
much of the occult traditions surrounding the creed of the
Sun-god, while to a certain extent it became heUenized
when the Magi strove to bring the more barbaric portion of
their dogma and its usages into harmony with the Hellenic
idea.!. To the art of Greece also it owed that ideal repre-
sentation of Mithra Tauroctonous which formed the central
object in the temples of the cult. The wide geographical
area it traversed and the immense influence thus exercised
was, however, due to the Roman.<;. The rites originally
reached Rome, Plutarch tells us, through the agency of
Cilician priates conquered and taken there by Pompey.
Another source, doubtless, was through the large number of
Asiatic slaves employed in Roman households. Again the
Roman soldiery must have carried the Mithraic cult to
Rome as they certainly were the means of its diffusion, as
far north as the mountains of Scotland, and southwards
to the borders of the Sahara Desert.
Mithraism may be said to have been the only living
religion which Christianity found to combat. It was
strong enough to exert a formative influence on certain
Christian doctrines, such as those relative to the end of the
world and the powers of hell. Mithra was essentially the
divinity of beneficence. He was the genius of celestial
light, endowing the earth v.oith all its benefits. As in his
character of the Sun be puts darkness to flight so by a
natural transition he came to represent ethically truth and
integrity, the sun of goodness which conquers the night of
evil. To him was ascribed the character of Mediator
bet wixt God and man ; his creed promised a resurrection
to a future life of happiness and felicity. Briefly the
story of Mithra is this : Jiis life he owed to no mortal
mother. In the gloom of a cavern Mithra sprang to being
from the heart of a rock, seen by none but humble shepherds.
He grew in strength and courage, excelling all, and used
his powers to rid the world of evil. Of all his deeds of
prowess, however, that one became the central motive of
hi'> cult wherein,. by slaying a bull, Hsel£ possessed of
divine potentialities, he dowered the earth with fruitfulness
and miraculous crops. From the spinal cord of the bull
sprang the wheat of man's daily bread. from its blood the
vine, source of the sacred drink of the Mysteries, and from
its seed all the different species of useful animals. After
this beneficent deed ?ltithra ruled in the heavens, yet still
keeping watch and ward over mankind, granting the
petitions asked in his name. Those who followed him, who
were initiated into his mysteries passed under his divine
protection, especially after death when he would rescue
their souls from the powers of darkness which fain would
seize upon the dead. And yet again Mithra would come,
when the earth was failing in her life-sustaining powers,
and again be would slay a divine bull and give to all abun-
dant life and happiness.
The mysteries and rites inspired the votaries with awe
while giving to their hearts hope of a future life. transcend-
ing that which they had known. T he temples, mithtzums
as they were called, were either built underground or were
caves and grottoes in the depths of dark forests, symbolising
the birthplace of their god. Among his worshippers were
slaves and soldiery, high officials and dignitaries, an ming-
ling fraternally in a religion which called them Brethren.
The rites were of magical significance. In order to bring
their lives into closer communion with the divinity of Mithra,
the neophytes must pass through seven degrees of initiation
successively assuming the names of Raven, Occult, Soldier,
Lion, Persian, Runner of the Sun and Father. Each of
these grades carried with them symbolic garments and
masks, donned by the celebrants. The masks represented
birds and ammals and would seem to indicate the existence
of belief in the doctrine of metempsychosis ; or perhaps
they were a remnant of totemic belief. An almost ascetic
habit of life was demanded, including prolonged fasting and
purification. The oath of silence regarding the rites was
taken, and before entering the higher grades a ceremony
called the Sacrament was held where consecrated bread
and wine were partaken of. Dramatic trials of strength,
faith and endurance were gone through by a.ll. a stoical
attitude and unflinching moral courage being demanded as
sign of fitness in the participant. The drinking of the
sacred v.oine, and the baptism of blood, were supposed to
bring to the initiate not only material benefit but wisdom ;
they gave power to combat evil, the power to attain to an
immortality such as that of their god. An order of priests
were connected with this cult, who faithfully carried on the
occult tradition and usages, such as that of initiation, the
rites of which were arduous ; the tending of a perpetual
fire on the altars ; prayers to the Sun at dawn, noon and
evening. There were sacrifices and libations, musical
rites including long psalmodies and mystic chants. The
days of the week were eachsacred to a Planet, the day of the
Sun being held especially holy. There were seasonal
festivals, the birth of the Sun being solemnized on the 25th
of December, and the equinoxes were days of rejoicing.
while the initiations were held preferably in the spring, in
March or April. It is believed that in the earliest days of
the cult some of the rites were of a savage and barbaric
character, especially the sacriiicial element, but these, as
indicated, were changed and ennobled as the beneficence
of J.\fithra took precedence of his warlike prowess. T he
Mithraic brotherhoods took temporal interests as well as
spiritual ones under their care. were in fact highly organised
communities, including trustees, councils, senat es, attor-
neys and patrons, people of high status and wealth. T he
fact of belonging to such a body gave to the initiate, be he
of noble birth or but a slave, a sense of brotherhood and
comradeship which was doubtless a powerful reason of the
ascendancy which the Mithraic cult gained over the Roman
army, whose members, dispersed to the ends of the earth
in lonely solitudes amid wild and barbaric races, would
find in this feeling of fraternity, this sharing in the worship
and ritual of the Sun-god, an infinite comfort and solace.

Mysticism : The attempt of man to attain to the ultimate
reality of things and enjoy communion with the Highest.
,\fystici.sm maintains the possibility of intercourse with
God, not by means of revelation, or the ordinary religious
Mysticism 284
channels, but by dint of introspection, culminating in the
feeling that the individual partakes of the <livine nature.
,"\1ysticism has been identified with pantheism by some
autuorities ; but it differs from pantheism in that its
motive i~ religious. But mysticism is greatly more specula-
tive than ordinary religion and insteael of commencing its
flights of thought from the human side, starts from the
divine nature rather than from man. The name mysticism
cannot be applied to any particular system. \Vhercas
religion teaches submission of the will and the ethical har-
monies of life, mysticism strains after the realisation of a
union with God Himself, The mystic desires to be as
close to God as possible, if not indeed part of the Divine
Essence Itself ; whereas the ordinary devotee of most
religious systems merely desires to walk in God's way a.nd
obey His will.
Mysticism may be said to have originated in the East,
where it probably evolved from kindred philosophic con-
cepts. The unreality of things is taught. by most Asiatic
religions, especially by Brahminism and Buddhism, and
the sense of the worth of human personality in these is
smal,l (Su India). The Sufis of Persia may be said to be a
link"between the more austere lndian mystics and those of
Europe. We find Sufism first arising in the ninth century
among tho Persian i\lahommedans, probably as a protest
against the severe monotheism of their religion ; but in all
likelihood more ancient springs contriuute to its revival.
In the Persia of Hafiz and Saadi, pantheism abounded, and
their magnificent poetry is read by Mahommedans as
having a deep mystical significance, although for the most
part it deals with love and intoxication. ln all probability
more is read into these poems than exlsts beneath the
surface, but at the same time it is certain that many of them
exhibit the fervour of souls searching for communion with
the highest. The rise of Alexandrian .Neoplatonism
(q.v.) was the signal for the introduction of mysticism
to a waiting Europe, and as this stage of txysticisnz
has been fully reviewed in a special article on the
subject, there is no necessity to follow it here. It may be
mentioned, however, that Neoplatonism made a definite
mark "Upon early Christianity, and we find it mirrored in
many of the patristic writings of the sixteenth century.
1t was Erigena who in the ninth century transmitted to
Europe the so-called writings of Dionysius the Areopagite
thus giving rise to both the scholasticism and mysticism
of the middle ages. Erigena based his own system upon
that of Dionysius. This was the so-called " negative
theology " which places God above all categories and
design:~.tes Hmi as Nothing, or The Incomprehensible
Essence from which the world of primordial causes is
eternally created. This creation is the Word or Son of
God, in Whom all substantial things exist; but God is the
beginning and end of everything. On this system Christian
mysticism may be said to have been founded with little
variation. With Erigena reason and authority were
identical, and in this he agrees with all speculative mystics ;
whereas scholasticism is characterised by the acceptance
by reason of a given matter which is pre-supposed even
when it cannot be ·understood. It seemed to Erigena that
in the scholastic system religious truth was external to the
mind, while the opposite view was fundamental to mysticism.
That is not to say that mysticism according to Erigena is a
mere subordination of reason to bith. Mysticism indeed
places every confidence in human reason, and it is essential
that it should have the unity of the human minJ with the
divine as its main tenet; but it accepts nothing from
without, and it posits the higher faculty of reason over the
realisation of absolute truth.
:.\1e<.li<eval mysticism may be said to have originated
from a reaction of practical religion against di31ecties in
Mysticism
which the true spirit of Christianity was then enshrined.
Thus St. Bernard opposed the dry scholasticism of
Abelard. His mysticism was profoundly practical, and
deals chiefiy with the means by which man may attain the
knowledge of God. This is to be accomplished through
contemplation and withdrawal from tile world. Thus
asceticism is the soul of medialVal mysticism ; but he
mistakenly averred regarding self-love that it is proper to
love ourselves for God's. sake, or because God loved us;
thus merging self-love ill love for God. ;,vc must, so to
speak, love ourselves in God, in Whom we ultimately lose
ourselves. Thus St. Bernard is almost Buddhistic, and
indeed his mysticism i~ of the universal type. Perhaps
Hugh of St. Victor, a contemporary oi St. Bernard's, did
more to develop the tcnet.s of mysticism ; and his monastery
of Augustinians ncar Paris became, under his influence, a
great centre of mysticism. One of his apologists, Richard
of St. Victor, declares that the objects ot mystic contem-
plation are partly above reason, and partly, as regar~s
intuition, contrary to reason. The protagonists of this
theory, all of whom issued from the same monastery, were
known as the Victorincs, who put up a stout fight agail!st t~e
dialecticians and l>Choolmen. Bonaventura, who d1ed m
1274, was a disciple of this school, and believer in the
faculty of mystic intuition. In the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, the worldliness of the church aroused much
opposition amongst laymen, and its cold formalism created
a reaction towards a more spiritual regime. Many sects
arose such as the \Valdenses, the Kathari, and the Beguines,
all of which strove to infuse into their teachings a warmer
enthusiasm than that which burned in the heart of the
church of their time. In Germany, mysticism made great
strides, and Machthild of Magdeburg, and Elizabeth ?f
Thuringia, were, if not the originators of mysticism lll
Germany, perhaps the earliest supporters of it. Joachim
of Flores and Amalric of Bena v.Tote strongly in favour of
the reformed church, and their writings are drench~ with
mystical terms, derived for th47 most part from. Engena.
Joachim mapped out the duration oi tne world mto three
ages, that of the Father, that of the Son, and. that of the
Spirit,-the first of which was to commence wtth the year
126o, and to be inaugurated by the general adoption of the
life monastic and contemplative. A sect called The ~ew
Spirit, or The Free Spirit, became widespread through
northern France, Switzerland and Germany ; and these
did much to infuse the spirit of mysticism throughout the
German land.
It is with Eckhart, who died in 1327, that we get t~e
juncture of 11~ysticism with scholastic theology. Of ~
doctrine it has been said : " The ground of your be1ng
lies in God. Reduce yourself ~o th01t simplicity, t?a.t ro.ot,
and you are in God. There JS no longer any diStinction
between your spilit and the divine,-you have escaped
personality and finite limitation. Your particular, creatu~e
self, as a something separate and dependent on God, 1s
gone. So also, obviously, your creaturely will. Hence-
forth, therefore, what seems an inclination of yours 1S 10
fact the divine good pleasure. You are free from law.
You are above means. The very will to do the will of
God is resolved into that will itself. This is the Apathy,
the Negation, the Povert:y:, be comm~nds. ~ith Eckhart
personally this self-reduction and deification IS connected
with a rigorous asceticism and exemplary mora~ excellence
Y<!t it is easy to see that it may be a merely tntellectual
process, consisting in a man's thinking that he is thinking
himself away from his personality. He declares !fle
appearance of the Son necessary to enable us to realize
our sonship ; and yet his language implies that this re~­
tion is the perpetual incarnation of that So~~oes, as tt
were, constitute him. Christi:lns are accordmgly not less
Mysticism 285 Naylor
the sons of God by grace than is Christ by nature. Believe
yourself divine, and the Son is brought forth in you. The
Saviour and the saved are dissolved together in the blank
absolute substance. "
With the advent of the black death, a great spirit of
remorse swept over Europe in the fourteenth century, and
a vast revival of piety took place. This resulted in the
foundation in Germany of a soc1ety of Friends of God, whose
chief object was to strengthen each vther in intercourse
v.oith the ..Crrator. Perhaps the most distingu:Sheti of
these were Tauler, and Nicolas of Basle, and the society
numbered many inm'\tes of the cloister, as well as wealthy
men of commerce and others. Ruysbroeck (q.v.) the
great Dutch mystic, was connected with them; but his
mysticism is perhaps more intensely practical than that
<>f any other visionary. It is the machinery by which
the union with God is to be effected which most attracts
him. In Ruysbroeck's life-time a mystical society arose
in Holland called the Brethren of the Common Lot, who
founded an establishment at which Groot dispensed the
principles of mysticism to Radewyn and Thomas a
Kempis.
'lhe attitude of mysticism at the period of the Reforma·
tion is peculiar. We find a mystical propaganda pretend-
ing to be sent forth by a body of Rosicrucians denouncing
Roman Catholicism in the fiercest terms, and we also
observe the spirit of mysticism strongly within l:bose bodies
which resisted the coldness and formalism of the Roman
Church. On the other hand, however, we find the principles
of Luther Strongly opposed by some of the mo~t notable
mystics.of his time. But the Reformation past, mysticism
went on its way, divided, it is true, so far as the outward
theological principles of its votaries were concerned, but
strongly united in its general principles.
It is with Nicholas of Kusa, who died in 1464. that
mysticism triumphs over scbolasticism. Nicolas is the
protagonist of super-knowledge, or that higher ignorance
which is the knowledge of the intellect in contra·distincton
to the mere knowled~e of the understanding. His doctrines
coloured those of G1ordano Bruno and his theosophy cer-
tainly preceded that of Paracelsus. The next great name
we meet with in mysticism is that of Boehme (q.v.), who
once and for all sy!<tematised Germl!.n philosophy. The
Roman Church produced many mystics of note in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, notably Francis of
Sales. Mme. Guyon and Molinos,-the last two of which
were the protagonists of Quietism, which set forth the
theory that there should be no pleasure in the practice of
mysticism, and that God did not exist for the enjoyment of
man. Perhaps the greatest students of Boehme were
William Law (q.v.), t686 to 1761, and Saint Martin (q.v.),
1743 to 1803.
But all mysticism is not necessarily identified with sect,
although undoubtedly its strongholds in this country
to-day ·are to be found in certain circles of the Church of
England. · There are still with us mystics who, professing
no definite theolol\ical teneL~, are yet mystic.~ in virtue of
their desire for umty with, or proximity to the Dcity, by
what they call " magical " methods. These are obscure,
and are probably the result of personal experiences, which
it is not given to everyone to comprehe11d ; but which,
nevertheless, may be very real indeed. For a good sum-
mary of such mysticism the reader is referred to Mr. A. E.
Waite's Azoth or the Star it~ the East ; See also Evelyn
Underhill's l~fysticism and The •'f.vstic Way.

Nature Spirits or Elementals, according to theosophy,
have bodies composed of the finer kinds of matter. There
are countless hosts of them, divided into !!even classes,
which allowing for two unmanifested, belong to the ether,
air, fire, ·water, and earth,-the last four being called by
the l{ab.tlists, sylphs, salamanders, undines, and gnomes
respectively; and at the head of each class is a deva or
inferior god. NaJure spirits work in unsuspected ways,
sometimes lending their aid to human beings in the form
of certain faculties, and those in the a.c;tral world are en-
gaged in the creation of form out of the matter which the
outpouring of the Logos has quickened, hence it is they
who form minerals, flowers, and so on. These 11aJure
spirits of the astral worlds of course have hollies of astral
matter, and they frequently from mischievous or other
impulses, change the appearance of these bodies. They are
just without the powers of ordinary vision, and many
people of more acute vision can sec them, while the action
of drugs also may make them visible.

Ndembo 286
Ndembo, The : Or l{ita is a secret society which has wide-
spread ramifications on the lower Congo, and especially in
the districts lying to the south of that river. Initiation is
made through the ganga, or chief, who instructs the
neophyte at a given signal suddenly to lie down as if dead.
A shroud is spread over him, and he is carried off to an
enclosure outside the village called vela, and is pronounced
to have died a Sdembo. Perhaps twenty, thirty, or e\-en
fifty C'lndidates .. die" at the one time. It is then assumed
that persons " dying" in this manner decay until only a
single bone remains, and this the ganga takes charge of.
The process varil'S from three months to as many years, and
the ganga is supposed by art magic to bring every one of the
dead back to life within that period. On a festivi!.l day of
the .Vdembo, the members march through the ,..jllagc in a
grand procession amidst universal joy, carrying ";th them
the persons who are supposed to have died. The neophytes
who arc supposed to have perished, comport themselves as
if in reality they had come from another world. They
take new names, pretend that everything in the terrestrial
sphere is new to them, turn a deaf ear to their parents and
relatives. and even affect not to know how to eat. They
further desire to have everything they set eyes on, and
if it is not granted to them immediately, they may fall upon
the unhappy owner and beat and even kill him without any
consequence to themselves; as it is assumed that they are
mere children in the afi,\irs of the terrestrial sphere, and
therefore know no better.
Those who have gone through this rite are called .Vganga,
or the " knowing ones," while the neophytes are designated
Vanga. During their occupation of the vela they learn an
esoteric language, which they constantly employ. Perhaps
the best picture of their cult has been given by Bastian,
who says:-
" The Great ~ki$Si (who hert: replaces the !etish) lives
in the interior of the woodlands where nobody can see him.
When he dies the Nganga carefully collect his bones in order
to bring them back to hfe, and nourish them that they may
again put on flesh and blood. But it i<~ not well to speak
about it. In the Ambamba country everybody must have
died once, and when the Nganga (replacing the fetish-
priest) shakes his calabash against a village, those men and
youths whose hour is come fall into a state of lifeless
torpor, from which they ~tenerally rise up in three days.
But the man whom the Nkissi loves he carries off to the
bush and often buries him for a series of yeaTS. \Vhen he
again awakens to life, he begins to eat and drink as before,
but his mind is gone, and the Nganga must himself educate
him and in'ltruct him in every movement, like the smallest
child. At first that can only be done with the rod, but the
senses gradually return, so that you can speak with him, and
when his education is finished the Nganga takes him back
to his parents. These would seldom recognise him but for
the positive assurance o! the Nganga, who at the same
time reminds them of earlier occurrences. 'Whoever has
not yet undergone the experience in Ambamba is universally
despised, and is not allowed to join in the dances.:•
Neeromancy : Or divination by means of the spirits of the
dead, from the Greek words nekros, dead ; and manteia,
divination. ltis through its Ihlian form nigromancia. that it
came to be known as the ''Black Art." With the Greeks it
originallysignified the descent into Hades in order to consult
the dead rather than summoning the dead into the mortal
sphere again. The art is of almost universal usage. Con-
siderable difference of opinion exists among modern adepts
as to the exact methods to be properly pursued in the
necrom'lntic art, and it must be borne in mind that t~ecro­
mancy, which in the )1iddle Ages was cailed sorcery, shades
into modem spiritualistic practice. There is no doubt
however, that necromancy is the touch-stone of occultism,
Neercmancy
for if, after careful preparation the adept can carry through
to a successful issue, the raising of the soul from the other
world, he has proved the value of his art. It would be
fruitless in this place to enter into a psyc!:ological dis-
cussion a.s to whether this feat is possible of accomplishment
or not, and we will confine o~:rselves to the material which
has been placed at our disposal by the sages of the past, who
ha·,•e left full details as to how the process should be
approached.
In the case of a compact existing between the conjuror
and the devil, no ceremony is necessary, as the familiar is
ever at hand to do the behests of his masters. This,
however, is never the case with the true so•cerer, who pre-
serves his independence, and trusts to his profound know-
ledge of the art and his powers of command ; his object
therefore is to " constrain" some spirit to appear before
him, and to guard himself from the danger of pro-
voking such beings. The magician, it m11st be understood
always bas an assistant, and every article named is pre-
pared according to rules well kno·.vn in the black art. In
the first place they are to fix upon a spot proper for such a
purpose; which must be either in a subterrancous vault,
hung round with black, and lighted by a magical torch ; or
else in the centreof some thick wood or desert, or upon some
extensive unfrequented plain, where several roads meet,
or amidst the ruins of ancient castles, abbeys, monasteries,
etc., or amongst the rocks on the sea shore, in some private
detached churchyard, or any other solemn, melancholy
place between the hours of twelve and one in the night,
either when the moon shines very bright, or else when the
elements are disturbed with storms of thunder, lightning,
wind, and rain; for, in these places, times, and seasons, it
is contended that spirits can with less difficulty manifest
themselves to mortal eyes, and continue visible with the
least pain, in this elemental external world.
\Vhen the proper time and place is fixed on, a magic
circle is to be formed, within which, the master and his
associate are carefully to retire. Tile dimensions of the
circle are as follow :-A piece of ground is usually chosen,
nine feet square, at the full extent of which parallel lines
are drawn one within the other, having sundry crosses and
triangles described between them, close to which is formed
the first or outer circle, then, about half-a-foot within the
same, a ;;econd circle is described, and w;thin that another
square correspondent to the first, the centre of which is the
seat or spot where the master and associate are to be
placed •· The vacancies formed by the various lines and
angles of the figure arc filled up with the holy names of
God, having crosses and triangles described between them.
The reason assigned by magicians and others for the
institution and use of circles, is, that so much ground being
blessed and consecrated by such holy words and ceremonies
as they make use of in forming it, hath a secret force to
expel all evil spirits from the bounds thereof, and, being
sprinkled with pure sanctified water, the ground is purified
from all uncleanness ; besides, the holy names of God
being written over every part of it, its force becomes so
powerful that no evil spirit hath ability to break through
it, or to get at the magician or his companion, by reason
of the antipathy in nature they bear to these sacred names.
And the reason given for the triangles is, that if the spirit
be not easily brought to speak the truth, they may by the
exorcist be conjured to enter the l':ame, where, by virtue of
the names of the essence and divinity of God, they can
speak nothing but what is true and right. The circle,
therefore, according to this account of it, is the principal
fort and shield of the magician, from which be is not, at
the peril of his life, to depart, till he has completely dis-
missed the spirit, particularly if he be of a fiery or infernal
nature. Instances are recorded of many who perished by
Necromancy 287
this means ; particularly " Chiancungi," the famous
Egyptian fortunc-t<'ller, who was so famous in England in
the t?lh century. He undertook for a wager, to raise up
the spirit " Bokim," and having described the circle, he
seated his sister Napula by him as his associate. After
frequently repeating the forms of exorcism, an4. calling
upon the spirit to appear, and nothing as yet answering his
demand, they grew impatient of the business, and quitted
the circle, but it cost them their lives; for they were
instantaneously seized and crushed to death by that infernal
spirit, who happened not to be sufficiently constrained
till that moment, to manifest himself to human eyes."
There is a prescribed form of consecrating the magic
circle, which we omit a~ unnecessary in a general illustra-
tion. The proper attire or " pontificalibus" of a magician,
is an ephod made of fine white linen, over that a priestly
robe o( black bombazine, reaching to the ground, with the
two seals of the earth drawn correctly upon virgin parch-
ment, and affixed to the breast of his outer vestment.
Round his waist is tied a broad consecrated girdle, with
the names Ya, Ya.-Aie, Aaie,- Elibra,-Elchim,-Sadai,
-Pah Adonai,-tuo robore,-Cinctus sum. Upon his
shoes must be written Tetragram!Tk1.ton, with crosses
round about; upon his head a high-crowned cap of sable
silk, and in his hand a lloly Bible, printed or written in
pure Hebrew. Thus attired, and standing within the
charmed circle, the magician repeats the awful form of
exorcism; and presently, the infernal spirits niake strange
and frightful noises. howlings, tremblings, Bashes, and
most dreadful shrieks and yells, as the forerunner of their
becoming visible. Their first appearance is generally in
the form of fierce and terrible lions or tigers, vomiting
forth fire, and roaring hideously about the circle; all
which time the exorcist must not suffer any tremour of
dismay; for, in that case, they will gain the ascendency,
and the consequences may touch his life. On the contrary,
he must summon up a share of resolution, and 'continue
repeating all the forms of constriction and confinement,
until they arc drawn nearer to the influence of the triangle,
when their forms will change to appearances less ferocious
and frightful, and become more submissive and tractable.
When the forms of conjuration have in this manner been
sufficiently repeated, the spirits forsake their bestial
shapes, and enter the human fotm, appearing like naked
men of gentle countenance and behaviour, yet is the
magician to be warily on his guard that they deceive him
not by such mild gestures. for they are exceedingly fraudu-
lent and deceitful in their dealings with those who con-
strain them to appear without compact, having nothing
in view but to suborn his mind, or accomplish his destruc-
tion. With great care also must the spirit be discharged
after the ceremony is finished, and he has answered all the
demands made upon him. The magician must wait
patiently till he has pa.'>scd through all the terrible forms
which announce his coming, and only when the last shriek
has died away, and every trace of fire and brimstone has
disappeared, may he IP.ave the circle and depart home in
safety. If the ghost of a deceased person is to be raised,
t he grave must be resorted to at midnight, and a different
form of conjuration is necessary. Still another, is the
infernal sacrament 'for •· any cnrpse that hath hanged,
drowned, or otherwise made away with itself; " and in
this case the conjurations are performed over the bodv,
which will at last arise. and standing upright, answer with
a famt and hollow voice the questions that are put to it.
Eliphas Levi, in his Ritual of 'Trat1scemlent Magic says
that ··~vocations should always havea motive and a becom-
ing end, otherwise they are works of darkness and folly,
dangerous for health and reason." The permissible motive
of an evocation may be either love or intelligence. Evoca-
Necromancy
tions of love require less apparatus and are in every respect
easier. The procedure is as follows : '' We must, in the first
place, carefully collect the memorials of him (or her) whom
we desire to behold, the articles he used, and on which his
iJ.llpression remains ; we must also prepare an apartment
in which the person lived, or otherwise one of a similar
kihd, and place his portrait veiled in white therein, sur-
Toundcd with his favourite flowers, which must be renewed
daily. A fixed date must then. be observed, either the
birthday of the person, or that day which was most fortu-
nate for his and our own affection, one of which we may
believe that his soul, however blessed elsewhere, cannot
lose the remembrance ; this must be the day for the evoca-
tion, and we must provide for it during the space of fourteen
days. Throughout this period we must refrain from
extending to anyone the same proofs of afiection which we
have the right to expect from the dead; we must observe
strict chastity, live in retreat, and take only one modest
and light collation daily. Every evening at the same hour
we must shut ourselves in the chamber consecrated to the
memory of the lamented person, using only one small
light, such as that of a funeral lamp or taper. This light
should be placed behind us. tile portrait should be uncovered
and we should remain before it for an hour, in silence;
finally, we should fumigate the apartment with a little
good incense, and go out backwards. On the morning of
the day fixed for the evocation, we should adorn ourselvt>s
as i£ for a festival, not salute anyone first, make but a
single repast of bread, wine, and roots, or fruits ; the cloth
should be white. two covers should be laid, and one portion
of the bread broken should be set aside ; a little wine
should also be placed in the glass of the person we design
to invoke. The meal must be eaten alone in the chamber
of evocations, and in presence of the veiled portrait; it
must be all cleared a"ay at the end,except the glass belong-
ing to the dead person, and his portion of bread, which
must be placed before the portrait. In the evening, at the
hour for the regular visit, we must repair in silence to the
chamber, light a clear fire of cypress-wood, and cast incense
seven times thereon, pronouncing the name of the person
whom we desire to behold. The lamp must then be
extinguished, and the fire permitted to die out. On this
day the portrait must not be unveiled. \Vhen the fiame
is extinct, put more incense on the ashes, and invoke God
according to the forms of the religion to which the dead
person belonged. and according to the ideas which he him-
self possessed of God. While making this prayer we must
identify ourselves with the evoked person, speak as he
spoke, believe in a sense as he believed ; then, after a
s1lence of fifteen minutes, we must speak to him as if he
were present, with affection and w1th faith, praying him to
manifest to us. Renew this prayer mentally, covering the
face with both hands ; then call him thrice with a loud
voice ; tarry on our knees, the eyes closed and covered, for
some minutes ; then call again thrice upon him in a sweet
and affectionate tone, and slowly open the eyes. Should
nothing result, the same experiment must be renewed in
the following year, and if necessary a third time, when it is
certain that the desired apparition will be obtained, and
the longer it has been delayed the more realistic and
striking it will be.
" Evocations of knowledge and intelligence are madew1th
more solemn ceremonies. H concerned with a celebrated
personage, we must meditate for twenty-one days upon his
life and writings, form an idea of his appearance, converse
with him mentally, and imagine his answers; carry his
portrait, or at1east his name, about us; follow a vegetable
diet for twenty-one days, and a severe fast during the last
seven. We must next construct the magical oratory.
This oratory must be invariably darkened ; but i£ we
Necromancy 288
operate in the daytime, we may leave a narrow aperture
on the side where the sun will shine at the hour of the
evocation, and place a triangular prism before the opening,
and a crystal globe, filled with water, before the• prism.
If the operation be arranged for the night the magic lamp
must be so placed that its single ray :;hall upon the altar
smoke. The purpose of the preparations is to furnish the
magic agent with elements of corporeal appearance, and to
case as much as possible the tension of imagination, which
could not be exalted without danger into the absolute
illusion of dream. For the rest, it will be easily understood
that a beam of sunlight, or the ray of a lamp, coloured
variously, and falling upon curling and irregular smoke, can
in no way create a perfect image. The chafing-dish con-
taining the sacred fire should be in the centre of the oratory,
and the altar of perfumes close by. The operator must tum
towards the east to pray, and the west to invoke ; he must
be either alone or assisted by two persons preserving the
strictest silence ; he must wear the magical vestments,
which we have described in the seventh chapter, and must
be crowned with vervain and gold. lie should bathe
before the operation, and all his under garments must be
of the most intact and scrupulous cleanliness. The cere-
mony should begin with a prayer suited to the genius of
the spirit about to be invoked and one which would be
approved by himself if he still lived. For example, it
would be impossible to evoke Voltaire by reciting prayers
in the style of St. Bridget. For the great men of antiquity,
we rnay see the hymns of Cleanthes or Orpheus, with the
adjuration terminating the Golden Verses of Pythagoras.
In our own evocation of Apollonius, we used the magical
philosophy of Patricius for the ritual, containing the
doctrines of Zoroaster and the writings of Hermes Trisme-
gistus. We recited the Nuctemeron of Apollonius in
Greek with a loud voice and added the following conjura-
tion:-
.. Vouchsafe to be present, 0 Father of All, and thou
Thrice Mighty Hermes, Conductor of the Dead. Asclepius
son of Hephaistus, Patron of the Healing Art ; and thou
Osiris, Lord of strength and vigour, do thou thyseli be
present too. Arnebascenis, Patron of Philosophy, and yet
again Asclcpius, son of Imuthe, who presidest over poetry.
• * • •
" Apollonius, Apollonius, Apollonius, Thou teachest the
!IIagic of Zoroaster, son of Oromasdes; and this is the
wvrship of the Gods."
For the evocation of spirits belonging to religions issued
from Judaism, the following kabalistic invocation of
Solomon should be used, either in Hebrew, or in any other
tongue with which the spirit in question is known to have
been familiar :-
.. Powers of the Kingdom, be ye under my left foot and
in my right hand ! Glory and Eternity, take me by the
two shoulders, and direct me in the paths of victory !
Mercy and Justice, be ye the equilibrium and splendour of
my life I Intelligence and Wisdom, crown me! Spirits of
Malchutfl, lead me betwixt the two pillars upon which rests
the whole edifice of the temple I Angels of Netsah and
Ilod, strengthen me upon the cubic stone of fesod I 0
Gedulael ! 0 Geburaet ! 0 Tipherelh I Bina~l. be thou
my love I Ruach Hoclunael, be thou my light I Be that
which thou art and thou shalt be, 0 Ketheriel ! Tschim,
assist me in the name of Saddai ! Cherubim, be my
strength in the name of Adcnzai! Beni-Eiobim, be my
brethren in the name of the Son, and by the power of
Zebaoth! Eloim, do battle for me in the name of Tett"a-
grammalion I !IIalachim, protect me in the name of fod
He Vau liB I Seraphim, cleanse my love in the name of
Elvoh I IIasmalim, enlighten me with the splendours of
Eloi and Sllechinah I Aralim, act I Ophanim, revolve
Necromancy
and shine! I!ajoth a Kadosh, cry, speak, roar, bellow I
Kadosh, Kadosh, Kadosh, Saddai, Adonai, ]otchavah,
Eieazereie : 1-lallelu-jah, 1-lallelu-jah, Hallelu-jah. Amen.'
It should be remembered above all, in conjurations, that
the nam:lS of Satan, Beelzebub, Adramelek, and others do
not designate spiritual unities, but legions of impure spirits.
" Our name is legion, for we are many," says the spirit
of darkness in the Gospel. Number constitutes the law, and
progress takes place inversely in hell-that is to say, the
most advanced in Satanic development, and consequently
the most degraded, are the least intelligent and feeblest.
Thus, a fatal law drives t he demons downward when they
wish and believe themselves to be ascending. So also
those who term themselves chiefs are the most impotent
and despised of all. As to the horde of perverse spirits, they
tremble before an unknown, invisible, incomprehensible,
capricious, implacable chief, who never explains his Jaw,
whose arm is ever stretched out to strike those who fail to
understand him. They give this phantom the names of
Baal, Jupiter, and even others more venerable, which
cannot, without profanation, be pronounced in hell. But
this Phantom is only a shadow and remnant of God, dis-
figured by their wilful perversity, and p~rsisting in their
imagination like a vengeance of justice and a remorse of
truth.
" When the evoked spirit of light manifests with dejected
or itritated countenance, we must ofier him a moral sacri-
fice, that is, be inwardly disposed to renounce whatever
offends him; and before leaving the oratory, we must
dismiss him, saying: "May peace be with thee! I have
not wished to trouble thee : do thou torment me not. I
shall labour to improve myself as to anything t~t vexes
thee. I pray, an<.l will still pray, "ith thee and for thee.
Pray thotl also both with and for me, and return to thy
great slumber, expecting that day when we shall--w~ke
together. Silence and adieu : "
Christian, in his Historie dele magic (Paris, 1871) says:-
" The place chosen for the evocation is not au unimportant
point. The most auspicious is undoubtedly that room
which contains the last traces of the lamented person. If it
be impossible to fulfil this condition, we must go in search
of some isolated rural retreat which corresponds in orienta-
tion and aspect, as well as measurement, "'ith the mortuary
chamber.
" The window must be blocked with boards of olive
wood. hermetically joined, so that no exterior light may
penetrate. The ceiling, the four interior walls, and the
floor must be draped "ith tapestry of emerald green silk,
which the operator must himself secure with copper nails,
invoking no assistance from strange :hands, because, from
this moment, he alone may enter into this spot set apart
from all, the arcane Oratory of the Magus. The furniture
which belonged to the deceased, his favourite possessions
and trinkets, the things on which his final glance may be
supposed to have rested-all these must be assiduously
collected and arranged in the order which they occupied at
the time of his death. If none of these souvenirs can be
obtained, a faithful likeness of the departed being must at
least be procured, it must be full length. and must be
depicted in the dress and colours which he wore during the
last period of his life. This portrait must be set up on the
eastern wall by means of copper fasteners, must be covered
with a veil of white silk, and must be surmounted with a
crown of those flowers which were most loved by the
deceased.
" Before this portrait there must be erected an altar of
white marble, supported by four column« which must
terminate in bull's feet. A five-pointed star must be
emblazoned on the slab of the altar, and must be com-
posed of pure copper plates. The place iu the centre of the
Necromancy 289
star, between the plates, must be large enough to receive the
pedestal of a cup-sh-'lped copper chafing-dish, containing
dessicated fragments of laurel wood and alder. By the
side of the chafing-dish must be placed a censer full of
incense. The skin of a white and spotless ram must be
stretched beneath the alter, and on it must be emblazoned
another pentagram drawn with parallel lines of azure blue,
golden yellow, emerald green, and purple red.
" A copper tripod must be erected in the middle of the
Oratory; it must be perfectly triangular in form, it must
be surmounted by another and similar chafing-dish, which
must likewise cont.1.in a quantity of dried olive wood.
" A high candelabrum of copper must be placed by the
wall on the southern side, and must contain a single taper of
purest white wax, which must. alone illuminate the mystery
of the evocation.
" The white colour of the altar, of the ram's skin, and of
t he veil, is consecrated to Gabriel, the planetary archangel
of the moon, and the Genius of mysteries : the green of
the copper and the tapestries is dedicated to the Genius of
Venus.
" The altar and tripod must both be encompassed by a
magnetized iron chain, and by three garlands composed of
the foliage and blossoms of the myrtle, the olive, and the rose.
" Finally, facing the portrait, and on the eastern side,
there must be a canopy, also draped with emerald silk, and
supported by two triangular columns of olive wood, plated
with purest copper. On the North and South sides, between
each of these columns and the wall, the tapest.Ty must fall in
long folds to the ground, forming a kind of tabernacle ;
which must be open on the eastern side. At the foot of
each column there must be a sphinx of white marble, with a
cavity in the top of the head to receive spices for burning.
It is beneath this canopy that the apparitions ·wi.ll manifest,
and it should be remembered that the Magus must turn to
the east for prayer, and to the west for evocation.
" Before entering this little sanctuary, devoted to the
religion of remembrance, the operator must be clothed in a
vestment of azure, fastened by clasps of copper, enriched
with a single emerald. He must wear upon his head a
tiara surrounded by a floriated circle of twelve emeralds,
and a crown of violets. On his breast must be the talis-
man of Venus depending from a ribbon of azure silk. On
the annular finger of his left hand must be a copper ring
containing a turquoise. His feet must be covered with
shoes of azure silk, and he must be provided 'vith a fan of
swan's feathers to dissipate, if needful, the smoke of the
perfumes.
·· The Oratory and all its objects must be consecrated
on a Friday, during the hours which are set apart to the
Genius of Venus. This consecration is performed by
burning violets and roses in a fire of olive wood. A shaft
must be provided in the Oratory for the passage of the
smoke, but cne must be taken to prevent the admission of
light through this channel.
" When these preparations are finished, the operator
must impose on himself a retreat of one-and-twenty days,
beginning on the anniversary of the death of the beloved
being. During this period he must refrain from conferring
on any one the least of those marks of affection which he
was accustomed to bestow on the departed : he must be
absolutely chaste, alike in deed and thought ; he must take
daily but one repast, consisting of bread, wine, roots, and
fruits. These three conditions are indispensable to success
in evocation, and their accomplishment requires complete
isolation.
·' Every day, shortly before mid-night, the Magus must
assume his consecrated dress. On the stroke of the mystic
hour, he must enter the Oratory, bearing a lighted candle
in his right hand, and in the other an hour-glass. The
Necromancy
candle must be fixed in the candelabra, and the hour-glass
on the altar to register the flight of time. The operator
must then proceed to replenish the garland and the floral
crown. Then he shall unveil the portrait, and erect it
immovable in front of the altar, being thus with his face
to the East, he shall softly go over in his mind the cherished
recollections he possesses of the beloved and departed
being.
" When the upper reservoir of the hour-glass is emply
the time of contemplation will be over_ By the flame of the
taper the operator must then kindle the laurel wood and
alder in the chafing-dish which stands on the altar ; then,
taking a pinch of incense from the censer, let him cast it
thrice upon the fire, repeating the following words :-
• Glory be to the Father of life universal in the splendour of
the infinite altitude, and peace in the twilight of the im-
measurable depths to all Spirits of good will ! '
" Then he shall cover the portrait, and taking up his
candle in his hand, shall depart from the Oratory, walking
backward at a slow pace as far as the threshold. The
same ceremony must be fulfilled at the same hour during
every day of the retreat, and at each visit the crown which
is above the portrait, and tho garlands of the altar and
tripod must be carefully renewed. The withered leaves
and flowers must be burnt each evening in a room adjoining
the Oratory.
" When the twenty-first day has arrived, the Magus
must do his best to have no communication with any one,
but if this be impossible, he must not be the first to speak,
and he must postpone all business till the morrow. On
the stroke of noon, he must arrange a small circular table
in the Oratory, and cover it with a new napkin of un-
blemished whtteness. It ID\lSt be garnished with two
copper chalices, an entire loaf, and a crystal flagon of the
purest ....~ne. The bread must be broken and not cut, and
the wine emptied in equal portions into the two cups.
Half of this mystic communion, which must be his sole
nourishment on this supreme day, shall be offered by the
operator to the dead, and by the light of the one taper he
must eat his own share, standing before the veiled portrait.
Then he shall retire as before, walking backward as far as
the threshold, and leaving the ghost's share of the bread
and wine upon the table.
" When the solemn hour of the evening has at length
arrived the Magus shall carry into the Oratory some well·
dried cypress wood, which he shall set alight on the altar and
the tripod. Three pinches of incense shall be cast on the
altar flame in honour of the Supreme Potency which mani-
fests itself by Ever Active I ntelligence and by Absolute
Wisdom. When the wood of the two chafing-dishes has
been reduced to embers, he must renew the triple offering of
incense on the altar, and must cast some seven times on the
fire in the tripod ; at each evaporation of the consecrated
perfume he must repeat the previous doxology, and then
t urning to the East, he must call upon God by the prayer of
that religion which was professed by the person whom he
desires to evoke.
" When the prayers are over he must reverse his position
and with his face to the West, must enkindle the chafing-
dishes on the head of each sphinx, and when the cypress is
fully ablaze he must heap over it well-dried violets and
roses. Then let him extinguish the candle which illuminates
the Oratory, and falling on his knees before the canopy,
between the two columns, let him mentally address the
beloved person with a plenitude of faith and affection. Let
him solemnly entreat it to appear and renew this interior
adjuration seven times, under the auspices of the seven
providential Genii, endeavouring during the whole of the
time to exalt his soul above the natural weakness of
humanity.
Necromancy 290 Neoplatonism
" Finally, the operator, with closed eyes. and with hands
covering his face, must call the invoked person in a loud
but gentle voice, pronouncing three times all the names
which he bore.
·• Some moments after the third appeal, he must extend
his arms in the form o£ a cross, and lifting up his eyes, he
will behold the beloved being, in a recognisable manner. in
front of him. That is to say, he will perceive that ethereal
substance separated from the perishable terrestrial body,
the fluidic envelope of the soul, which Kabalistic initiates
have termed the Perispirit. This substance preserves the
human form but is emancipated from human infirmities,
and is energised by the special characteristics whereby
the imperishable individuality of our essence is manifested.
Evoked and Evoker can then inter-communicate intelligibly
by a mutual and mysterious thought-transmission.
" The departed soul will give counsel to the operator;
it will occasionally reveal secrets which may be beneficial
to those whom it loved on earth, but it will answer no
question which has reference to the desires of the flesh; it
will discover no buried treasures, nor will it unveil the
secrets of a third person ; it is silent on the mysteries of
the superior existence to which it has now attained. Jn
certain cases, it will, ltowever, declare itself either happy or
in punishment. If it be the latter, it will ask for the
prayer of the Magus, or for some religious observance,
which we must unfailingly fulfil. Lastly, it will indicate
the time when the evocation may be renewed.
" \\'hen it has disappeared, the operator must turn to
the East, rekindle the fire on the altar, and make a final
oflenng of incense. Then he must detach the crown and
the gatlands, take up his candle, <~.nd retire with his face
to the West till be is out of the Oratory. His last duty is
to burn the final remains of the flowers and leaves. Their
ashes, united to those which have been collt>cted during
the time.of retreat, must be mixed with myrtle seed, and
secretly buried in a field at a depth which will secure it
from disturbance of the ploughshare."
The last two examples are, of course, those of " white "
11ecromancy. The procedure followed by savag4;: tribes is
of course totally different. Among certain Australian
tribes the necromants are called Birraark. It is said that a
Birraark was supposed to be initiated by the " mrarts"
(ghosts) when they met him wandering in the bush. It was
from the ghosts that he obtained replies to questions con-
cerning events passing at a distance, or yet to happen,
which might be of interest or moment to his tribe. An
account of a spiritualseance in the bush is given in" Kam-
ilaroi and Kurnai" (p. 251) : " The fires were let down;
the Birraark uttered the cry ' Coo-ee • at intervals. At
length a distant reply was heard, and shortly afterwards
the S.:>und as of persons jumping on the ground in succession.
A voice was then heard in the gloom asking in a strange
intonation ' What is wanted ? • At the termination of the
seance, the spirit voice said, • We are going.' Finally, the
Birraark was found in the top of an almost inaccessible
tree, apparently asleep." (See also New Zealand.)
In Japan, ghosts can be raised in various ways. One
mode is to " put into an andon" (a paper lantern in a
frame), " a hu11dred rusblights, and repeat an incantation
of a hundred lines. One of these rushlights is taken out at
the end o£ each line. and the would-be ghost-seer then goes
out in the dark with one light still burning, and blows it
out, when the ghost ought to appear. Girls who have
lost their lovers by death often try that sorcery."
The mode of procedure as practised in Scotland was
thus. The haunted room was made ready. He, ·' who
was to do the daring deed, about nightfall entered the room,
bearing with him a table, a chair, a candle, a compass. a
crucifix if one could be got, and a Bible. With the com-
pass he cast a circle on the middle of the fioor, large enough
to hold the chair and the table. He placed within the
circle the chair and the table, and on the table he laid the
Bible and the crucifix beside the lighted candle. If he
bad not a crucifix. then he drew the figure of a cross on·the
floor within the circle. \Vhen all this was done, he rested
himself on the chair, opened the Bible, and waited for the
coming of the spirit. Exactly at midnight the spirit came.
Sometimes the door opened slowly, and there glided in
noiselessly a lady sheeted in white, with a face of woe
and told her story to the man on his asking her in the
name of God what she wanted. What she wanted was done
in the morning, and the spirit rested ever after. Some-
times the spirit rose from the .floor, and sometimes came
forth from the wall. One there was who burst into the
room with a strong bound, danced wildly round the circle.
and flourished a lnog whip round the man's head, but
never dared to step within the circle. During a pause in
his frantic dance lle was asked, in God's name, what he
wanted. He ceased his dance and told his wishes. His
wishes were carried out, and the spirit was in peace."
In Wraxall's "Memoirs of the Courts of Berlin, Dresden.
\Varsaw. and Vienna" there is an amusing account of
the raising of the ghost of the Chevalier de Saxe. Reports
had been circulated that at his palace at Dresden there Wa.!>
secreted a large sum of money, and it was urged that if his
spirit could be compelled to appear, interesting secrets
might be extorted from him. Curiosity, combined with
avarice. accordingly prompted his principal heir, Prince
Charles. to try the experiment, aod, oo the appointed night,
Schrepfer was the operator in raising the apparition. He
commenced his proceedings by retiring into the corner of
the gallery, where, kneeling do"n with many mysterious
ceremonies, he invoked the spirit to appear. At length a
loud clatter was heard at all the windows on the outside,
resembling more the effect produced by a number of wet
fingers drawn over the edge of glasses than anything else
to which it could well be compared. This sound announced
the arrival of the good spirits, and was shortly followed by
a yell of a frightful and unusual nature, which indicated
the presence of malignant !.pirits. Scluepfer continued his
invocations. when " the door suddenly ooened with violence,
and something that resembled a blackball or globe rolled
into the room. It was enveloped in smoke or cloud, in the
midst of which appeared a human face, like the countenance
of the Chevalier de Saxe, from which issued a loud and
angry voice, exclaiming in German, " Carl, was wollte du
mit mich? "-"Charles, what would thou do ·with me?"
By reiterated exorcisms Schrcpfer finally dismissed the
apparition. and the terrif1ed spectators dispersed fuUy
convinced of his magical powers.
Neoplatonisro : A mystical philosophic system initiated by
Plotinus of Alexandria A.D. 233, which combined the
philosophy of ancient Greece with more modern spiritual
cravings. Although to some extent founded on the teach-
ing of Plato, it was undoubtedly sophisticated by a deep
mysticism, which in all probability emanated from the
traditions of the land in which it originated. To a great
extent it coloured the thought of medi:.eval mysticism and
magic. Plotinus, its founder, commenced the study of
philosophy in Alexandria at the age of 28. He early
experienced an earnest desire to reach the truth concern-
ing existence, and to that end made a deep study of the
dialogues of Plato and the metaphysics of Aristotle. He
practised the most severe austerities. and attempted to
live what he called the " angelic" life, or the life of the
disembodied in the body. He was greatly drawn to
Apollonius of Tyana by reading his Life by Philostratus,
and gave credence to many of the marvels recorded therein.
The union of philosopher and priest in the character of
Neoplatonism 291
Apollonius fired the imagination of Plotinus, and in his
Pytha~orean teachings the young student discovered the
elements of both Oricntalism and Platonism,-for both
Pythagoras and Plato strove to escape the sensuous, and
to realise in contemplative abstraction that tranquility
superior to desire and passion which made men approach
the gods; but in the hands of the later Pythagoreans
and Platonists, the principles of the Hellenic masters
d~enerated into a species of theurgic freen:asonry. ::\!any
of the Pythagoreans had joined the various Orphic assoda-
tioas. and indeed had sunk to be mere itinerant vendors of
charm'>.
It is probable that at Alexandria Plotinus heard from
Orientals th.e principles of eastern theosophy, which he
did not find in Plato. But everywhere he found a grow-
ing indifference to religion as known to the more ancient
Greeks and Egyptians. By this time, the Pantheon<; of
Greece, Rome and Egypt, had become fused in the worship
of Serapis, and this fusion had been forwarded by the
works of Plutarch, Apuleius. and Lucian. The position of
philosophy at this time was by no means a strong one. In
fact speculation had given place to ethical teaching. and
philosophy was regarded more as a branch of literature, or
an elegant recreation. Plotinus persuaded himself that
philosophy and religion should be one ; that speculation
should be a search after God. It was at this time that he
first ~eard of Ammonius Saccas, who shortly before had
beefl a porter in the streets of Alexandria, and who lectured
upon the possibilities of reconciling Plato and Aristotle.
"Scepticism," said Ammonius, "was death." He recom-
mended men to travel back across the past, and out of the
whole bygone world of thought to constructa system greater
than any of its parts. This teaching formed an cppch in
the life of Plotinus, who was convinced that Platonism,
exalted into a species of illuminism and drawing to itself
like a magnet all the scattered truth of the bygone ages.
could alone preserve mankind from scepticism. He
occupied himself only with the most abstract questions
concerning knowledge and being. ·•Truth," according to
him, "is not the agreement of our comprehension of an
external object with the object itself, but rather the agree-
ment of the mind with itself. For the philosopher the
objects we contemplate, and that which comtcmplates are
identical : both are thought." All truth is then easy.
Reduce the soul to its most perfect simplicity, and we find
it is capable of expioration into the mfmite ; indeed it
becomes one with the infinite. This is the condition of
ecstasy, and to accomplish it a stoical austerity and ascetic-
ism "as necessary. The Neoplatonists were thus ascetics
and enthusiasts. Plato was neither. According to Plotin-
us, the mystic contemplates the divine perfection in him-
self ; all worldly things and logical distinctions vanish
during the period of ecstasy. This, of course, is purely
~ri~~tal and .uot Platonic at all. Plotinus regards the
md•v•dual CXIStcnce as phenomenal and transitory, and
subordinates reason to ecstasy where the Absolute is in
question. It is only at the end of his chain of reasoning
that he introduces the supernatural. He is fitst a rational-
ist, afterwards a mystic, and only a mystic when be finds
that he cannot employ the machinery of reason. The
letter of Plotinus, written ahout 260 A.D. well embodies
his ideas on these heads, and is as follows :-
.. Plotinus to Flaccus.- I applaud your devotion to
phi!osophy; r rejoice to hear that your soul has set sail,
like the returning Ulysses, for its native land-that glorious,
tMt only real country-the world of unseen truth. To
follow philosophy, the scn:-_tor Rogatianus, one of the
noblest of rny disciples, gave up the other day all but the
whole of his patrimony, set free his slaves, and sur-rendered
all the honours of his station.
Neoplatonism
"Tidings have reached us that Valerian has been defeated
and is now in tho hands of Sapor. The threats of Franksand
Allemanni, of Goths and Per~ians, are alike terrible by
turns to our degenerate Rome. In days like these, crowded
with incessant calamities, the inducements to a life of con-
templation are more than ever strong. Even my quiet
existence seems now to grow somewhat sensible of the
advance of years. Ago alone I am unable to debar from
my retirement. I am weary already of this prison-house,
the body, and calmly await the day when the divine nature
within me shall be set free from matter.
·• The Egyptian priests used to tell me that a single
touch with the wing of their holy bird could charm the
crocodile into torpor ; it is not thus speedily, my dear
friend, that the pinions of your soul will have power to
still the untamed body. The creature will yield only to
watchful, strenuous constancy of habit. Purify your soul
from all undue hope and fear about earthly thing&, mortify
~the body, deny sclf,-affections as well as appetites, and
the inner eye will begin to exercise its clear and solemn
vision.
"You ask me to tell you how we know, and what is our
criterion of certainty. To write is always irksome to me.
But for tho continual solicitations of Porphyry, I should
not have left a line to survive me. For your own sake.
and for your father's, my reluctance shall be overcome.
" External objects present u& only with appearances.
Concerning them, therefore, we may be said to possess
opinion rather than knowledge. The distinctions in the
actual world of appearance arc of import only to ordinary
and practical men. Our question lies within the ideal
reality which exist.<~ behind appearance. How does the
mind perceive these ideas? Are they without us. and is
the reason, like sensation, occupied with objects external
to itself? What certainty could we then have, what
assurance that our perception was infallible 1 The object
perceived would be a something different !rom the mind
perceiving it. We should have then an image instead of
reality. It would be monstrous to believe for a moment
that the mind was unable to perceive ideal truth exactly
as it is, and that we had not certainty and real knowledge
concerning the world of intelligence. It follows, therefore,
that this region of truth i~ not to be investigated as a thing
external to us, and so only imperfectly known. It is
within us. Here the obj~:cts we contemplate and that
which contemplates arc identical,-both are thought. The
subject cannot surely k':ow an object different from itself.
The world of ideas lies within our intelligence. Truth,
therefore, i<> not the agreement of our apprehension of an
external object with the object itself. It is the agreement
of the mind with itself. Consciousness, therefore, is the
sole basis of certainty. The mind is its own witness.
Reason sees in itself that which is above itself as its source;
and again, that which is below itself as still itself once more.
" Knowledge has three d~grees -Opinion, Scienc~.
Illumination. The means or mstrumont of tho first ts
sense ; of the second, dialectic; of the third intuition.
To the last I subordinate reason. It is absolute know-
ledge founded on the identity of the mind knowing with
the object known.
"There is a raying out of all orders of existence, an
external emanation from the ineffable One (prudos).
There is again a returning impulse, drawing all upwards
and inwards towards the centre froro whence all came
(epistrophe). Love, as Plato in the Banquet beautifully
says, is the child of Poverty and Plenty. In the amorous
quest of the soul after the Good, lies the painful sense of
fall and deprivation. But that Love is blessing, is salva-
tion, is our guardian genius ; without it the centrifugal
law would overpower us, and sweep our souls out far from
Neoplatonism 292
their source toward the cold extremities of the Material
and the :\funi!old. The wise man recognises the idea of
the Good within him. This he develops by withdrawal
into the Holy Place of his own soul. He who does not
understand how the soul contains the Beautiful within
itself, seeks to realize beauty without, by laborious pro-
duction. His aim should rather be to concentrate and
simplify, and so to expand his being; instead of going
out into the Manifold, to forsake it for the One, and so to
ftoat upwards towards the divine fount of being whose
stream Bows within him.
" You ask, how can we know the Infinite? I answer,
not by reason. It is the office of reason to distinguish
and define. The Infinite, therefore, cannot be ranked
among its objects. You can only apprehend the Infinite
by a faculty superior to reason, by entering into a state
in which you are your finite self no longer, in which the
Divine Essence is communicated to you. This is Ecstasy.
It is the liberation of your mind from its finite conscious-
ness. Like only can apprehend like ; when you thus
cease to be finite, you become one with the Infinite. In
the reduction of your SO\Il to its simplest self (aplosis),
its divine essence, you realize this Union. this Identity
(enosin).
" But this sublime condition is not of permanent dura·
tion. It is only now and then that we can enjoy this
elevation (mercifully made possible for us) above the
limits of the body and the world. 1 myself have realized
it but three times as yet, and Porphyry hitherto not once.
All that tends to purify and elevate the mind will assist
you in this attainment, and facilitate the approach and the
recurrence of these happy intervals. There are, then,
different roads by which this end may be reached. The
love of beauty which exalts the poet; that devotion to
the One and that ascent of science which makes the am-
bition of the philosopher ; and that love and those prayers
by which some devout and ardent soul tends in its moral
purity towards perfection. These are the great highways
conducting to that height aoove the actual and the particu-
lar where we stand in the immediate presence of the
Infinite, who shines out as from the deeps of the soul."
Plotinus appears to have been greatly indebted to
Numenius for some of the ideas peculiar to his system.
Numenius attempted to harmonise Pythagoras and Plato,
to elucidate and confirm the opinions of both by the relig-
ious dogmas of the Egyptians, the :\fagi and the Brahmans ;
and he believed that Plato was indebted to the Hebrew
as well as to the Egyptian theology for much of his wisdom.
Like Plotinus he was puzzled that the immutable One
could find it possible to create the Manifold without self-
degradation, and he therefore posited a Being whom be
calls the Dcmi-urge, or Artificer, who merely carried out
the will of God in constructing the universe.
Taken in a nutshell, the mysticism of Plotinus is as
tollows : One cannot know God in any partial or finite
manner; to know him truly we must escape from the
finite, from all that is earthly, from the very gifts of God
to God Himself, and know him in the infinite way by
receiving, or being received into him directly. To accom-
plish this, and to attain this identity, we must withdraw
into our inmost selves. into C11r own essence, which alone
is susceptible of blending with the Divine Essence. Hence
t 1e inmost is the highest, and as with all systems of mystic-
ism introversion is ascension, and God is found within.
Porphyry entered the school of Plotinus when it had
become an institution of some standing. At first he
strongly opposed the teachings of his master, but soon
beca:ne his most devoted scholar. He directed a fierce
assault on Christianity, and at the same time launched
strictures at Paganism ; but both forces \\ere too ~trong
Neoptatonism
for him. The attempt of the school to combine relig10n
and philosophy robbed the first of its only power, and the
last of its only principle. Religion in the hands of the
Neoplatonists lost all sanctity and authoritativeness, and
philosophy all scientific precision, and the attempt to
philosophise superstition ended in mere absurdity. But
they succeeded in one thing, and that was in making
philosophy superstitious-no very difficult task.
Porphyry modified the doctrine of Plotinus regarding
ecstasy, by stating that in that condition the mind dOC$
not Jose its consciousness of personality. He calls it a
dream 10 which the soul, dead to the world, rises to a
species of divine activity, to an elevation above reason.
action and liberty. He believed in a certain .order of evil
genii, who took pleasure in hunting wild beasts, and others
of whom hunted souls that had escaped from the fetters
of the body; so that to escape them, the soul must once
more take refuge in the ftesh. Porphyry's theosophie
conceptions, based on those of Plotinus, were strongly and
ably traversed by the thcurgic mysteries of Iamblichus,
to whom the priest was a prophet full of deity. Criticising
Porphyry, Iamblichus says :-
,, Often, at the moment of inspiration, or when the
affiatus has subsided, a fiery Appearance is seen,-the
entering or departing Power. Those who are skilled in
this wisdom can tell by the character of this glory the
rank of divinity who has seized for the time the reins of
the mystic's soul, and guides it as he will. Sometimes
the body of the man subject to this influence is violently
agitated, sometimes it is rigid and motionless. In some
instances sweet music is heard, in others, discordant and
fearful sounds. The person of the subject has been known
to dilate and tower to a superhuman height; in other
cases. it has been lifted U{> into the air. Frequently, not
merely the ordinary exerc1se of reason, but sensation and
animal life would appear to have been suspended; and
the subject of the a!Ratus has not felt the application of
fire, has been pierced with spits, cut with knives, and been
sensible of no pain. Yea. often, the more the body and
the mind have been alike enfeebled by vigil and by fasts,
the more ignorant or mentally imbecile a youth may be
who is brought under this influence, the more freely and
unmixedly will the divine power be made manifest. So
clearly arc these wonders the work, not of human skill
or wisdom, but of supernatural agency I Characteristics
such as these I have mentioned, are the marks <-f the true
inspiration.
" Now, there are, 0 Agathocles, four great orders of
spiritual existence,-Gods, Dremons, Heroes or Demi-gods,
and Souls. You will naturally bo:: de•,irous to learn ho'l"
the apparition of a God or a Dremon 1s distinguished from
those of Angels, Principalities, or Souls. Know, then,
that their appearance to man corresponds to their nature,
and that they always manifest them.~elves to those who
invoke them in a mann<~r consonant with their rank in the
hierarchy of spiritual natures. The appearance$ of
Gods are uniform, those of Dremons various. The
Gods shine -with a benign aspect. When a God mani-
fests himself, he frequently appears to bide sun or moon,
and seems as he descends too vast for earth to contain.
Archangels arc at once awful and mild; Angels yet more
gracious ; Dremons terrible. Below the four leading
classes I have mentioned are placed the malignant Dremons,
the Anti-gods.
" Each spiritual order has gifts of its own to bestow on
the initiated who evoke thell). The Gods confer health of
body, power and purity of mind, and, in short, elevate
and restore our natures to their proper principles. Angels
and Archangels ha-ve at their command only subordinate
bestowments. Dremons, ho,vcvcr, are hostile to the
Meoplatonlsm 293 New Thought
aspirant,-a:fllict both body and mind, and hinder our
escape from the sensuous. Principalities, who govern tbe
sublunary elements, confer temporal advantages. Those
of a lower rank, who preside over matter, often display
their bounty in material gifts. Souls that are pure are,
like Angels, salutary in their influence. 1heir appearance
encourages the soul in its upward efforts. Heroes stimu-
late to great actions. All these powers depend, in a
descending chain, each species on that immediately above
1t. Good D:emons arc seen surrounded by the emblems
of blessing, D:emons who execute judgment appear with
the instruments of punishment.
"There is nothing unworthy of belief in what you have
been told concerning the sacred sleep, and divination by
dreams. I explain it thus :-
•· The soul has a two-fold life, a lower and a higher.
In sleep that soul is freed from the constraint of the body,
and enters, as one emancipated, on its divine life of intelli-
gence. Then, as the noble faculty which beholds the
objects that truly arc-the objects in the world of intelli-
gence-stirs within, and awakens to its power, who can
be surprised that the mind, which contains in itself the
principles of all that happens, should, in this its state of
liberation, discern the future in those antecedent principles
which will make that future what it is to be ? The nobler
part of the soul is thus united by abstraction to higher
natures, and becomes a participant in the wisdom and
foreknowledge of the Gods.
" Recorded examples of this are numerous and well-
autheQticated ; instances occur, too, every day. Numbers
of sick, by sleeping in the tcm~lc of lEsculapius, have
had their cure revealed to them 10 dreams vouchsafed by
the god. Would not Alexander's army have perished but
for a dream in which Dionysius pointed out the means of
safety ? Was not the siege of Aphutis raised through a
dream sent by Jupiter Ammon to Lysander? The night-
time of the body 1s the day-time of the soul."
We thus see how in the process of time the principles
on which the system of Plotinus rested were surrendered
little by little, while divination and evocation were prac-
tised with increasing frequency. Plotinus had declared
the possibility of the absolute identiftcanon of the divine
with human nature-the broadest possible basis for
mysticism. Porphyry took up narrower ground and
contended that in the union which takes place in ecstasy,
we still retain consciousness of personality. Iamblichus
diminished the real principle of mysticism still farther in
theory, and denied that man has a faculty, eternally
active and in accessible, to passion: so that the intellectual
ambition so lofty in Plotinus subsided among the followers
of Iamblichus into magical practice.
Proclus was the last of the Greek Neoplatonists. He
elaborated the Trinity of Plotinus into a succession of
impalpable triads, and surpassed Iamblichus in his devotion
to the yractice of theurgy. With him, theurgy was the
art whtch gives man the magical passwords that carry
him through barrier after barrier, dividing species from
species of the upper existences, till at. the summit of the
hierarchy he arrives at the highest. Above all being is
God, the Non-Being, who is apprehended onJy by negation.
When we arc raised out of our weakness and on a level with
God, it seems as though reason were silenced for then we are
a bove rca~on. In short we become intoxicated with God.
Proclus was an adept in the ritual of invocations among
eYery people in the world, and a great magical figure.
With the advance of I3yzantinism, he represented the old
world of Greek "thought, and even those who wrote against
him as a heatnen show the influence he exercised on their
doctrines. Thus Dionysius attempted to accommodate
the philosoph.}• of Proclus to Christianity, and greatly
admired his asceticism. The theology of the Neoplatonists
was always in the first instance a mere matter of logic.
They confounded Uni\'ersals with Causes. The highest
became with them merely the most comprehensive. As
has been said Nwplatonism exercised ~reat power among
the scholiasts and magicians of the IDlddle ages. In fact
all that medi;cvalism knew of Plato was through the
medium of the Neoplatonists. In Germany in the four-
teneth century it became a vivifying principle; for although
its doctrine of emanation was abandoned, its allegorical
explanation, its exaltation of the spirit above the letter
was retained, and Platonism and mysticism together
created a party in the church- the sworn foes of scholas-
ticism and mere lifeless orthodoxy.

New Motor, The : A strange machine constructed in 1854 by
John Murray Spear (q.v.) at the instigation of the" Associa-
tion of Electricizers," one of the bands of spirits by whom
he was controlled. It was to derive its motive power from
the magnetic store of nature, and was therefore to be as
independent of artificial sources of energy as was the
human body. lhe machine was hailed as a god-the
"Physical Saviour of the race," the "New Messiah"-
and a certain lady, in obedience to a vision, went to the
Htgh Rock (Lynn, Mass.) whereon stood the N8W Motor,
and for two hours suffered " birth-pangs," whereby she
judged that the essence of her spiritual being was imparted
to the machine. At the end of that time it was averred
that pulsations were apparent in the motor. A. J. Davis
expressed the belief that the design was the work of spirits
of a mechanical turn of mind, but was of no practical value.
'!he New M otor was finally smashed by the inhabitants
of Randolph (N.Y.) whither it had been taken. In all it
cost its builder some two thousand dollars. In common
fairness to the Spiritualists it may be said that the majority
had no sympathy whatever with such an absurd scheme.

New Thought : A present-day religion which in some of its
tenets is akin to Christian Science, or faith-healing. Unlike
Christian Science, however, it does not affect entirely to
dispense v.-ith all material aids, as drugs, the setting of
broken bones, and so on. Nor does it give the whole
credit for the cure to the imagination of the patient, as
does hypnotism. But striking a point midway bet ween the
two it gives considerable prominence to the mind in the
healing process, while not altogether despising the doctor.
Mind is considered as highly refined matter, and therefo~e
the " mind" cure is in a measure a material cure. It IS
clear that that part of the New Thought which deals with
bodily healing has its roots in the Animal Magnetism a~d
Mesmerism of bygone times. So much have they 10
commo.n that it is needless to trace mental-healing further
back than Dr. Phineas Parkhurst Quimby lx8oz-t866) the
first to make usc of the terms ·· mental-healing" and
"Christian Science." Dr. Quimby was the son of a New
Hampshire blacksmith, and was himself apprenticed to a
clockmaker, having had but little education. At the age of
thirty-six he attended a lecture on Mesmerism, and there-
after practised for himself. With the aid cf a clairvoyant
youth he cured diseases, and so successful was his treat-
ment that be soon adopted magnetic healing as a profession.
At length, however, he got a glimpse of the true reason for
his success-the expectation of the patient. The diagnoses
of his clairvoyant he attributed to the latter's telepathic
New Zealand 294
reading of the p:~.tient's own thoughts, and he judged that
the treatment prescribed depended for its efficacy on the
confidence it inspired rather than on its intrinsic merits.
From this point he ~radually evolved his doctrine that
disease was a mere delusion, a traditional error that haci
fixed itself in men's minds, which it behoved them to be
rid of as soon as might be. The way i:o cure disease,
therefore, was to destroy the error on w.hich it rested.
Besides Christian Science, Quimby called his doctrine the
Science of Health, or the Science of He~lth and Happiness.
He had many disciples, among whom were Mrs. Mary
Baker G. Eddy, the founder of the Christian Science Church.
Others whose influence was felt more in the direction of the
New Thought movement were the Rev. \V. F. Evans and
Mr. and :Mrs. Julius Dresser, whose son, Horatio W. Dresser,
remains one of the ablest exponents of the New Thought
As has been said, the method of healing practised by this
school is not considered to be entirely immaterial. It is no
longer believed, of course, that a fiuid emanates from the
finger-tips of the operator, or that he radiates a luminous
odic fo'rce; but Mr. Dresser 1\imself states that the com·
munication is of a vibratory character, made up of ethereal
undulations directed and concentrated by the thought of
the healer. The power is equally efficacious at a distance
and may be used without the patient's knowledge or even
against his will. This belief in action at a distance is some-
thing of a bug-bear to the New Thinker, who fears the
ascendency of an evil influence as the superstitious of the
Middle Ages feared bewitchment. But there is a spiritual
aspect of the New Thought as well as a physical one. The
health of the soul is as fully considered as the health of the
body. Spiritual sanity, then, is to be procuTed by lifting
oneself to a higher plane of existence, by shutting o\lt the
things of the ea1th and living" in tune with the infinite."
We must realise our own identity with the Infinite Spirit
and open our lives to the Divine inflow. Ralph Waldo
Trine, himself a New Thinker, says in an expressive meta·
phor, " To recognise our own divinity and our intimate
relation to the Universal, is to attach the belt of our
machinery to the power-house of the Universe." In
short, we must have sufficient self-confidence to cast our
fears aside and rise unfettered into the Infinite.
New Zealand: Maori superstitions. Amidst the mythologi-
cal personages of New Zealand " the spirits of the dead "
ever play a very prominent part, and our chief interest in
noticing the Maoris, lies in the fact, that belief in, and open
communion with these spirits, still exist. The priests or
" Tohungas" are unmistakably " Mediums," in the
modern sense of the term. Sometimes they are born with
their gift, and sometimes they are devoted to the priestly
office by their parents and acquire their power after the
fashion of Ea~tern ecstatics, by prayer, fasting and con-
templation. That good prophets exist amongst the Maoris
bas bet'ln abundantly proved. During the time when
Great Britain busied herself in colonizing New Zealand, her
officials frequently wrote home, that the Maori would
never be conquered wholly; information of the parties
sent out to attack them; the very colour of the boats, and
the hour when they would arrive; the number of the
enemy, and all particulars essential to their safety, being
invariably communicated to the tribes befo•ehand by
their prophets or Tohungas.
The best natural prophets and seers amongst the Maoris
are of the female sex ; and although the missionaries try
to account for the marvellous powers they exhibit, above
all for the sound of the Spirit voice, which is a common
phase in their communion with the dead--on the bypothe·
sis that the women who practise " the arts of sorcery," are
ventriloquists-this attempted explanation rarely covers
the ground of the intelligence which is received.
New Zealand
In his Old New Zea/a11d General Cummings cites an
interesting case of Tohungaism. A certain young chief
had been appointed Registrar of births and deaths, "'hen
he suddenly came to a violent end. The book of registries
was lost, and much inconvenience ensued. The man's
relatives notified their intention of invoking his spirit, and
invited General Cummings to be present at the ceremony,
an invitation which he accepted. " The appointed time
came. Fires were lit. The Tobunga repaired to the
darkest corner of the room. All was silent, save the sobbing
of the sisters of the deceased warrior-chief. There were
thirty of us, sitting on the rush-st:I:ewn floor, the door shut
and the fire now burning down to embers. Suddenly there
came a voice out from the partial darkness, ' Salutation,
salutation to my family, to my tribe, to you, pakeha, my
friend !.' Our feelings were taken by storm. The oldest
!>i.c;ter screamed, and rushed with extended arms in the
direction from whence the voice came. Her brother,
seizing, restrained her by main force. Others exclaimed,
' Is it you ? Is it you ? Truly it is you I ane I aue I'
anj fell quite insensible upon the Boor. The older women
and some of the aged men were not moved in the sii,ghtest
degree, though believing it to be the spirit of the chief.
·• Whilst reflecting upon the novelty of the scene, the
' darkness visible ' and the deep interest manifest, U.e
spirit spoke again, • Speak to me my family; speak to me,
my tribe: speak to me, the pakeha ! ' At last the silence
gave way, and the brother spoke: • Row is it with you?
Is it well \~ith you in that country ? • The answer came,
though not in the voice of the Tohunga-mt>dium, but in
strange sepulchral sounds : ' It is v.ell with me ; my
place is a good place. I have seen our friends; they are
all with me ! ' A woman from another part of the room
now anxiously cried out, ' Have you seen my sister ? '
' Yes, I have seen her; she is happy in our beautiful
country.' 'Tell her my love sogreat for her will nevercease.'
• Yes, I will bear the message.' Here the native woman
burst into tears, and my own bosom swelled in sympathy.
" The spirit speaking again, giving directions about
property and keepsakes, 1 thought I would more thoroughly
test the genuineness of all this: and I said, • We cannot
find your book with the registered names; where have you
concealed it? ' The answer came instantly, ' I concealed
it between the tahuhu of my house, and the thatch ;
straight over you, as you go in at the door.' The brother
rushed out to see. AU was silence. In five minutes he
came hurriedly back. \>'ith the book in his b.and I It
astonished me.
" It was now late, and the spirit suddenly said, • Fare-
well my family, farewell, my tribe; I go.' Those present
breathed an impressive farewell, when the spirit cned out
again, from high in the air, • Farewell ! '
·• This, though seemingly tragical, is in every respect
literally true. But what is that ? ventriloquism, the
devil, or what ! . . ."
Mrs. Britten, in her Nineteenth Century Miracles says:
" The author has herself had several uroofs of the Medium-
istic power possessed by these • savages' but as her
experiences may be deemed of too personal a character, \IC
shall select our examples from other sources. One of
these is furnished by a Mr. Marsden, a person who w::.s
well-known in the early days of New Zealand's colonial
history, as a miner, who grew rich ' through spiritual
communications.' Mr. Marsden was a gentleman who h<ld
spent much time amongst the Maoris, and who still keeps
a residence in ' the King country,' that is-the district of
which they hold control. Mr. Marsden informed the
author, that his success as a gold miner, was entirely due
t6 a communication he bad received through a native
woman who claimed to have the power of bringing down
.New Zealand 295 New Zealand
spirits-the ;)laoris, be it re:ncmbered, always insisting
that the spiriu descend through the air to earth to visit
mortals. ~Ir. :\larsden had long been prospecting un-
successfully in the gold regions. He had a friend in partner-
ship with him, to whom he was much attached, but who
had been accidentally killed by a fall from a cliff. The
Spirit of this m(l.n came unsolicited, on an occasion when
~Ir. )llar;;den was consulting"' native seeress, for the purpose
of endeavouring to trace out what had becom:: of a valuable
watch which he had lost. The voice of the spirit was
first heard in the air, app"'rently above the roof of the hut
in which they sat, calling Mr. :'llarsden by his familiar name
of ' :\Iars.' Greatly startled by these sounds, several
times repeated, at the ::\Iedium's command, he remained
perfectly still until the voice of his friend speaking in his
well-remembered Scotch accent sounded close to his ear,
whilst a column of grey misty substance reared 1tself by
his side. This apparition was plainly visible in the subdued
light of the hut, to which there was only one open entrance,
but no window. Though he was much startled by what
he saw and heard, Mr. Marsden had presence of mind
enough to gently put his h(l.nd through the misty column
which remained intact, as if its substance offered no resist-
ence to the touch. Being admonished by an earnest
whisper from the Maori woman, who had fallen on her
knees before the apparition, to keep still, he obeyed, when
a voice-seemingly from an immense distance off-yet
speaking unmistakably in his friend's Scotch accents,
advised him to let the watch alon~for it was irreparably
gone-but to go to the stream on the banks of which they
had last bad a meal together trace it up fo• six miles and a
half, and then, by following its course amidst the forest,
be would come to a pile, which would make him rich, if he
chose to remain so. Whilst he was waiting and listening
breathlessly to hear more, ;\ir. Marsden was startled by a
slight detonation at his side. Turning his head he observed
that the column of mist was gone, and in its place, a quick
flash, like the reflection of a candle, was aU that he beheld.
Here the seance ended, and the astonished miner left the
hut, convinced that he had heard the Spirit of his friend
talking to him. He added, that he followed the directions
given implicitly, and came to a mass of surface gold lying
on the stones at the bottom of the brook in the depth of
the forest. This he gathered up, and though he prospected
for seve•al days in and about that spot, ·he never found
another particle of this precious metal. That which he
had secured he added, with a deep sigh. was indeed enough
to have made him independent for life, had it not soon
been squandered in fruitless speculations."
So deeply has the Maori mind been satarated with ages
of superstition that among the civilised, well-educated
da<>ses there may to-day be observed numero\1S expressions
and actions which have their' odgin in an instinctive dread
of the supernatural. ' Many degree$ of superstition exist
among the Maoris of the present day, says a writer in the
Pall Mall Ga~elle. In the recesses of the Urewera country
for example, diablerie ha.~ lost little of its early potency ;
the tohunga there remains a power in the land. Among
the more enlightened natives a precautionary policy is
generally followed; it is always wiser and safer, they say,
to avoid conflict with the two mysterious powers tapu and
ma~uta. Tapu is the less dangerous of the two; a house,
an individual, or an article may be rendered tapu, or
sacred, and if the tapu be disregarded harm will befall
someone. But makuta is a powerful evil spell cast for the
deliberate purpose of accomplishing harm, generally to
bring about death. The tohunga is understood to
be in alliance with the spirits of the dead. The
Maori dreads death, and he fears the dead. Places of
burial are seldom approached during the day, never at
night. The spirits of the dead are believed to linge1
sometimes near places of bunal. Without going to expe•ts
iu ~Iaori lore, who have many and vai'ied theories to set
forth, a preferable course is to discover what the ave,age
l\laori of to-day thinks and believes •especting the strange
poWers and influentes be deems are at ><ork in the world
around him.
A :\Iaori of this type-who can read and write, is under
fo•ty years of age, anO fairly intelligent-was drawn into
a lengthy conversation with the writer. He believed,
magistrates notwithst."tnding, that tohungas, someltow,
had far more power than ordinary men. He did not think
they got that power from the " tiapo" (the devil ? ) ; they
just were able to make themselves masters of men and of
many things in the World. There are J:nany degrees of
Tohunsaism. An ordinary man or woman was powerless
against a lohunga, but one tolnmga could overcomeanother.
The speaker knew of an instance of one tohunga driving the
tohunga power entirely out of a weaker rival. Jt was a
fairly recent east coast occurrence. Three Maoris had
accidentally permitted their pigs to trespass into the
tohunga's potato paddock, and much damage and lo~s was
the result. The tohun.ga v.ras one of the dangerous type,
and being very wroth, he makutucd the three men, all of
whom. promptly died. Nobody was brave enough to
charge the tolmttga with causing the death of the men ; they
Vlere all afraid of this terrible makuta. At length another
tohunga was heard of, one of very great power. This
oracle was consulted, and he agreed to deal effectively
with tohun.ga number one, and punish bim for killing the
owner of the pigs. So, following his instructions, the
first-mentioned ·individual was seized, and much against
his will, was conveyed to the home of tl1e greater magician.
:.\fany ::\{aoris, it should be known, stand in awe of hot
water, they will not handle it, even for purposes connected
with cooking or cleaning. Into a large tub of hot water the
minor tohu11ga struggling frantically, was placed, then he
wa." given a page torn from a Bible, which he was ord~red
to chew and swallow. The hot water treatment, combmed
with the small portion of the white man's sacred volume,
did the expected work ; the man v.as no longer a tolumga,
and frettin~ over his lost powers, he soon afterwards died."
Spiritualtsm.-Amon(T.st the earliest investigators in
Dunedin, was a :\Ir. John Logan. Before he had become
publicly identified ,,;th the cause of Spiritualism, ~n
associatio::~ had been formed, the members of which steadily
pursued their investigations in private circles and se~t ­
public gatherings. One of the most marked events m
connection with the early development of Spiritualism in
Dunedin, however, was the arraignment and church trial
of Mr. Logan, the circumstances of which may be bnetly
summed up a$ follows. This gentleman, although holding
a high position in the first Presbyterian church of the city,
had attended circles and witnessed Spiritualistic phenomena
and it was cnri'enUy repoi'ted that one of his own near
relatives was a very remarkable :Medium. On the t gtb
of March, t87J, Mr. Logan was summoned to appear
before a Church Convocation, to be held for the purpose
of trvinP his case, and if necessary, dealing with his ·• delin-
queri'cy."• Mr. Logan was in the evl'nt de-prived of his
church membership.
In many of the principal towns besides Dunl.'din, circles
he!d at first in mere idle curiosity, have produced their
usual fruit of mediumistic power, and this again ha.s
extended into associative action, and organisation into
local societies. For over a year, the Spiritualists and
Liberalists of Dunedin secured the services of Mr. Charles
Bright as their lecturer. This gentleman had once been
attached to the editorial staff of the Jlfelboume Argus, and
had obtained a good reputation as a capable \\'liter, and
Ngai 296
liberal thinker. Mr. Bright's lectures in Dunedin were
highly appreciated, and by their scholarly style and attrac-
tive manner, served to band together the liberal element
in the city. In Auckland, the principal town of tae North
Island, the same good service was rendered to the cause of
religious thought, by the addresses of the Rev. :Mr.
Edgar, a clergyman '\\hOSe Spiritualistic doctrines, had
tended to sever him from sectarian organisations, and
draw around him, the Spiritualists of the town. Besides the
good work effected by these gentlemen, the o=ional
v~stts of Messrs. Peebles, Walker, J. Tyerman, and the
effect of the many private circles held in every portion of
the islands, tended to promote a general, though quiet,
diffusion of Spiritual thought and doctrine, throughout

.Nicolai, Christoph Frledrloh: (17JJ-10llJ, A ~man author
and bookseller of Berlin, is interesting from the occult
point of view because of the peculiar experiences which
befel him, and of which he treats in his personal account
read before the Royal Society of Berlin. It would be
impossible to present the circumstances of his case, which is
one of the most celebrated in the annals of psychology,
better than in his own words.
"In the first two months of the year 1791," be says, "I
was much affected in my mind by several incidents of a
very disagreeable nature; and on the 24th of February a
circumstance occurred which irritated me extremely. At
ten o'clock in the forenoon my wife and another person
came to console me; I was in a violent perturbation of
mind, owing to a series of incidents which had altogether
wounded my moral feelings, ~nd from which I saw no
possibility of relief. when suddenly I observed at the dis·
tance of ten paces from me a figure-the figure of a deceased
person. I pointed at it, and asked my wife whether she
did not see it. She saw nothing, but being much alarmed,
endeavoured to compose me, and sent for the physician
The figure remained some seven or eight minutes, and at
length I became a little more calm; and as I was extremely
exhausted, I soon afterwards fell int'o a troubled kind of
slumber, which lasted for half an hour. The vision was
ascribed to the great agitation of mind in which I had been,
and it was supposed I should have nothing more to appre·
bend from that cause; but the violent affection had put
my nerves into some unnatural state. From this arose
further consequences, which require a more detailed
description.
" In the afternoon, a little after four o'cloc~e, the figure
Nicolai
which I had seen in the morning again appeared. I was.
alone when this happened, a circumstance which, as may
be easily conceived, could not be very agreeable. I went
therefore to the apartment of my wife, to whom I related it..
But thither also the figure pursued me. Sometimes it was
present, sometimes it vanished, but it was always the
same standing figure. A little after six o'clock several
stalking figures also appeared ; but they bad no connection
with the standing f~gure. I can assign no other cause for
this apparition than that, though much more composed in
my mind, I had not been able so soon entirely to forget the
cause of such deep and distressing vexation, and bad
reftected on the consequences of it, in order, if possible, to
avoid them; and that this happened three hours after
dinner, at the time when digestion just begins.
" At length I became more composed with respect to the
disagreeable incident which had given rise to the first
apparition ; but though I bad used very excellent medicines
and found myself in other respects perfectly well, yet the
apparitions did not diminish, but on the contrary rather
increased in number, and were transformed in the most
extraordinary manner.
" The figure of the deceased person never appeared to me
after the first dreadful day, but several other figures
shewed themselves afterwards very distinctly, sometimes
such as I knew, mostly, however, of persons I did not know,
and amongst those known to me, were the semblance of both
living and deceased persons, but mostly the former, and I
made the observation, that acquaintance with whom I daily
conversed never appeared to me as phantasms; it was·
always such as were at a distance.
"It is also to be noted, that these figures appeared to
me at all times, and under the most different circumstances,
equally distinct and clear. Whether I was alone, or in
company, by broad day-light equally as in the night-time.
in my own as well as in my neighbour's house; yet when
I wa:s at another person's house, they were less frequent,
and when I walked the public street they very seldom
appeared. \Vhen 1 shut my eyes, sometimes the figures
disappeared, sometimes they remained even after I had
closed them. If they vanished in the former case, on
opening my eyes again, nearly the same figures appeared
which I had seen before.
" I sometimes conversed with my physician and my
wife concerning the phantasms which at the time hovered
around me ; for in general the forms appeared oftener in
motion than at rest. They did not always continue
present~they frequently left me altogether, and again
appeared for a short or longer space of time, singly or more
at once; but, in general, several appeared together. For
the most part I saw human figures of both sexes ; they
commonly passed to and fro as if they had no connection.
with each other, like people at a fair where all is bustle ;
sometimes they appeared to have business with one another.
Once or tv•tice I saw amongst them persons on. horsebac~
and dogs and birds ; these figures all appeared to me m
their natural size, as distinctly as if they had existed in
real life, with the several tints on the uncovered parts of
the body, a!ld with all the different kinds and colours of
clothes. But J think, however, that the colours were
somewhat paler than they are in nature.
" None of the f1gures had any distinguishing characteris-
tic, they were neither terrible, ludicrous, nor repulsive ;
m~;~st of them were otdinary in their appearance,-some
were even agreeable.
" On the whole, the longer I continued in this state, the
more did the number of the phantasms increase, and the
apparitions became more frequent. About four weeks
afterwards I began to hear them speak : sometimes the
phantasms spoke with one another, but for the most part
Nif 297 Nightmare
they addressed themselves to me, these speeches were tn
general short, and never contained anything disagreeable.
Intelligent and respected friends often appeared to me, who
endeavoured to console me in my grief, which still left
deep traces on my mind. This speaking I heard most
frequently when I was alone; though I sometimes beard
it in company, intermixed with the conversation of real
persons; frequently in single phrases only, but sometimes
even in connected discourse.
" Though at this time I enjoyed rather a good state of
health both in body and mind, and had become so very
!amiliar with these phantasms, that at last they did not
excite the least disagreeable emotion, but on the contrary
afforded me frequent subjects for amusement and mirth ;
yet as the disorder senstbly increased, and the figures
appeared to me for whole days together, and even during
the night, if I happened to awake, I had recourse to several
medicines."
He then recounts how the apparitions vanished upon
blood being let.
" This was performed on the 2oth of April, at eleven
o'clock in the forenoon. I was alone with the surgeon;
but during the operation, the room swarmed with human
forms of every description, which crowded fast one on
another. This continued till half-past four o'clock, exactly
the time when the digestion commences. I then observed
that the figures began to move more slowly; soon after-
wards the colours became gradually Jlll.ler; every seven
minutes they lost more and more of their intensity, without
any alteration in the distinct figure of the apparitions.
At about half-past six o'clock all the ftgures were entirely
white, and moved very little ; yet the forms appeared
perfectly distinct; by degrees they became visibly less
plain, '\\;thout decreastng in number, as had often formerly
been the case. The figures did not move off, neither did
they vanish, which also had usually happened on other
occasions. In this instance they dissofved immediately
into air; of some even whole pieces remained for a length
of time, which also by degrees were lost to the eye. At
about eight o'clock there did not remain a vestige of any
of them, and I have never since experienced any appearance
of the same kind. Twice or thrice since that time I have
felt a propensity, if I may be allowed to express myself, or a
sensation as if I saw something which in a moment again
was gone. I was even surprised by this sensation whilst
"'riting the present account, having, in order to render it
more accurate, perused the papers of 1791, and recalled to
my memory all the circumstances of that time. So little
are we sometimes, ev~n in the greatest composure of mind,
masters of our imagination."

flight, Mystical, of the Suns : It was believed by the Sufis
t~at ~o attain to the coveted state of mysti.cal contempla-
bon, 1t was necessary to close the gateway of the physical
senses, so that the inner or spiritual senses might operate
more freely. This injunction was sometimes taken
literally, as by the Brahmin Yogis, who carefully closed
eyes, ears, nose and mouth, in order to attain to visionary
ecstasy. The Mystical Night is thus a shutting out of all
external sense-impressions, of hope, fear, consciousness of
self, and every human emotion, so that the interior light
may be more clearly perceived.
Jflg~tmare : (Old English night .and mara, a spectre). A
dtsorder of the digestive junctions during sleep, inducing
the temporary belief that some animal or demon is sitting
on the chest. Among savages and primitive people it is
thought that the affection proceeds front the attentions of
;:~n evil spirit. Keysler in his very curious work, A tlliqt•itates
selectae Septentrionales et Celticae, has collected many inter·
esting particulars concerning the nightmare. Nachtmar,
he says, is from Mair, an old woman, because the spectre
which appears to press upon the breast and impede the-
action of the lungs is generally in that form. The English
and Dutch words coinci<ie with the German. The French
cochemar is Mulier incumbens or lncuba. The Swedes use
Mara alone, as we learn from tht> Historia Seucorum Gotha-
rumque of Eric Olaus, where he states that Valender, the
sorr of Suercher, succeeded to the throne of his father, who
was suffocated by a d<emon in his sleep, of that kind which by
the scribes is called Mara. Others," we suppose Germans,"
continues Keyslcr, " call it Hanon Tramp. The French
peasantry call it Dianus which is a corruption either of Diana
or of DtBmonium Meridianum for it seems there is a belief
(which Keysler, not improbably thinks may be derived
from a false interpretation of an expression in the grst
Psalm ('the destruction that wasteth at noon-day') that
persons are most exposed to such attacks at that time
and, therefore, '~omen in childbed are then never left
alone. But though the Damonium Meridianum is often
used for the Ephialtes, nevertheless it is more correctly
any sudden and violent attack which deprives the patient
of his senses. In some parts of Germany, the name given
to this disorder is den alp, or das A lp-dructen, either from the-
• mass ' which appears to press on the sufferer or from
Alp or Alf (elf). In Franconia it is die Drud or das Drud-
dructen, from the Druid or Weird Women, and there is a
belief that it may not only be chased away, but be made
to appear on the morrow in a human shape, and lend some-
thing required of it by the following charm:-
Druid to-morrow
So will I borrow."
These Druids, it seems, were not only in the habit of
riding men, but horses also, and in order to keep them out
of the stables, the salutary penialpha (which bears the name
of Druden-jrtSs, Druid's foot) should be written on the-
stable doors, in consecrated chalk, on the night of St.
Walburgh. We must not omit that our English familiar
appellation • Trot ' is traced up to ' Druid ' " a decrepit
old woman such as the Se.gas mi~ht be," and the same
may perhaps be said of a Scottish Saint. Triduana or
Tredwin.
In Ihre's Glossary, a somewhat different account of the
Mara is given. Here again, we find the ' witch-riding'
of horses, against which a stone amulet il' pro.vid~ by
Aubrey, similar to one which we are about to notice Imme-
diately below.
Among the incantations by which the nightmare may be
chased away, Reginald Scot has recorded the followin~
in his Discovery of Wit(;}tcraft.
" St. George, St. George, our lady's knight,
He walked by day so did be by night :
Until such times as he her found,
He her beat and be her bound,
Unti~ her troth to him plight,
He would not come to her that night."
" Item," fontinues the same ingenious author, ·• hang-
a. stone over the afflicted person·~ bed, which stone ha~h
naturally sueh a hole in it, as wherein a string may be put
through it, a.od so be hanged over the diseased or bewitched
party, be it man, woman, or horse."
Every readet of the above lines will be reminded of the
similar charm which Shakespeare has put into the mouth of
Edgar as Mad Tom in King Lear.
" Saint Withold footed thrice the Wold ;
He met the night-mare and her ninefold
Bid her alight,
And her troth plight
And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee.''
Nirvanic 298 Oak Tree
Another charm of earlier date occurs in Chaucer's
Miller's Tale. When the simple Carpenter discovers the
crafty Nicholas in his feigned ab~traction, he thinks he
may perhaps be hag-ridden, and addresses hitn thus :-
·• I crouch the fro Elves and fro wikid ·wightes
And therewith the night-spell he seide arightes,
On four halvis of the house about,
And on the dresbfold of the dore without,
•jesu Christ, and Scint Benedigbt,
Blesse this house from evrey wikid wight,
Fro the night's marc, the wite paternoster,
Where \Vennist thou Seint Peter's sister."
A more modern author has pointed to some other formu-
laries, and has noticed that Asmodeus was the fiend of
most evil repute on these occasions. In the Otia Imperiala
<>f Gervase of Tilbury, ~orne other protecting charms are
said to exist. To turn to the medical history of the Incubus
Pliny has recommended two remedies for this complaint ;
one sufficiently simple, wild p;:cony seed. Another, which
it would not be easy to discover in any modern pharmaco-
pooia, is a decoction in wine and oil of the tongue, eyes, liver,
and bowels of a dragon, wherewith, after it has been left to
cool all night in the open air, the patient should be anointed
every morning and evening.
Dr. Bond, a physician, who tells us that he himself was
much afflicted with the nightmare. published an Essay on
the Incttbus in 1753. At the time at which he wrote, medical
.attention appears to have been very little called to the
disease, and some of the opinions hazarded were sufficiently
wild and inconclusive. Thus Dr. Willis said it was owing
to so:ne"ncongruous matter which is mixed with the nervous
fluid in the cerebellum (de Anima Brtllorum) ; and Bellini
thought it imaginary, and to be attributed to the idea of
some demon which existed in the mind the day before.
Both of these writers might have known better if they would
have turned to Fuch!oius (with whom Dr. Bond appears to be
equally acquainted) who in his work de Curandi Ratione,
published as early as 1548, has an excellent chapter (I., 31)
on the causes, symptoms, and cure of nightmare, in which
he attributes it to repletion and indigestion, and recom-
mends the customary discipline.

Horton, Thomas: The e:<act date of tllis alchemist's birth
is wrapped in mystery, while comparatively little is recorded
about his life in general. But at least it is known that
Bristol w~ his native place, and that, in the year r436,
he was elected to represent that town in Parliament. This
'Points to his having been an upright and highly-esteemed
person, and the conjecture is buttressed in some degree by
the fact that Edward IV. made him a member of his privy
.council, and employed him repeatedly as an ambassador.
At an early age Norton showed himself curious concerning
alchemy and the like, demonstrating his predilection herein
by attempting to make the personal acquaintance of

was reputed a man of extraordinary learnmg, and was
author of numerous alchymical works. For many months
Norlo" sought this per~on in vain, but at length the Canon,
yielding to tl1e other's importunity, wrote to him in the
following manner :- ·· I shall not longer delay ; the time

After receiving this very friendly and encouraging letter,
Norton hurried straightway to Ripley's p•e~ence, and there·
after for upwards of a month the two were constantly
together, the ei<Jer man taught the novice many things,
while he even promised that, if he showed himself an apt
and worthy pupil, he would impart to him the secret of the
medicinal stone. And in due course this promise was
fulfilled, yet it is reported that 1\'oJ'/on's own chymical
researches met with various signal disappointments. On one
occasion, for instance, when he had almost perfected a
certain tincture, his servant absconded with the crucible
containing the p~ecious fluid; while at a later time, when
the alchemist was at work on the same experiment, and
thought he was just about to reach the goal, his entire
paraphernalia was stolen by a Mayoress of Bristol, And
this defeat must have been doubly galling to the unfortunate
philosopher, for soon afterwards the Mayoress became very
wealthy, presumably as a result of her theft.
Norton himself does not appear to have reaped pecuniary
benefit at any time from Iris erudition, but to have been a
comparatively poor man throughout the whole of his life;
and the fact is a little surprising, for his Ordinall of Alchitny
was a popular work jn the middle ages, and was repeatedly
published. The original edition was anonymous, but the
writer's identity bas been determined because the initial
syllables in the first six lines of the seventh chapter compose
the following couplet :-
,, Thomas Norl<~n of Briseto
A parfet master you may hi.m trow."
Yorton died in 1477. and his predilections descended to
one of his grandsons. This was Samuel Norton, who was
born in 1548, studied science at St. John's College, Cam- .
bridge, and afterwards became a Justice of the Peace and
Sheriff of Somersetshire. lie died about 1604, and in
1630 a collection of his alchemistic tracts was published at
Frankfort.

Oak Apples, as diviners. It is said that if one wishes to
discover whether a child be bewitched, one may do so by
1ollowing this procedure : drop three oak apples into a basin
of water under the child's cradle, at the same time pre-
serving the strictest silence ; if they doat the child is not
fascinated, but ii they sink it is.
Oak Tree : The oak, from time immemorial, bas held a high
place as a sacred tree. The Druids worshipped the oak,
and performed many of their rites ander the shadow of its
branches. When Augustine preached Christianity to tbe
ancient Britons, he stO{)d under an oak tree. The ancient.
Hebrews evidently held the oak as a sacred tree. There is
a tradition that Abraham received his heavenly visitors
under an oak. Rebekah's nurse was buried under an oak,
called afterwards the oak of weeping. Jacob buried the
idols of Shechem under an oak. It was under the oa.k of
Ophra, Gideon say, the angel sitting, who gave him instruc-
tions as to what be was to do to free Israel. When Joshua.
and Israel made a covenant to serve God, a great stone was
set up in e\-idencc under an oak that was by the sanctuary
of the Lord. The prophet sent to prophesy against
Jeroboam was found at Bethel sitting under an oak. Saul

and his sons were buried under an oak, and, according to
Isaiah. idols were made of oak woOd. Abimelech was made
king by the oak· that was in Shechem. During the eigh-
teenth oentur}' its influence in curing diseases was believed
in. The toothache could be cured by boring with a nail
the tooth or gum lill blood came, and then driving the nail
into an oak tree. A child with rupture could be cured by
splitting an oak branch and passing the child through the
opening backwards three times; if the splits grew together
afterwards, the child would be cured.

Obereit, JobDaD HermaDD: Swiss Mystic and Alchemist,
1725-1798. Born in 1725 at Arbon, in Switzerland, Johann
Oberrit was the son of a scientist keenly interested in
Hermetic philosophy, and no doubt the boy's own taste
therefore developed the more speedily on account oi the
parental predilection. Very soon Johann became deter-
mined tc. discover the philosopher's stone, hoping thereby
to resuscitate the fortunes of his family, ,.-hicb he found at
a low ebb, presumably because the elder Obercit had
expended large sums on his alchemistic pursuits ; and the
young man worked strenuously to gain his ends, maintain-
ing all along that whoso would triumph in this endt>avour
must not depend on scientific skill, but rather on constant
communion with God. Notwithstanding this pious theory
of his, he soon found himself under the ban of tile civic
authorities, who carne to his laboratory, and forced him to
forego futher operations, declaring that these constituted
a danger to public health and safety. That, at least, they
gave as their reason; but the likelihood is that, in their
ignorance, they looked askance upon all scientific researches.
Ober&il, bitterly incensed, appears to have left his native
place, and to have lived for some time thereafter with one
Lavater, a brother of the noted physiognomist of that
name; while it would seem that, at a later date, be re-
nounced the civilised world altogether, and took up his
abode in the lofty fastnesses of the Alps. No hermit's life
did he live here, however; for, according to his own recital,
he took to himself as bride a seraphic shepherdess named
Thcantis, with whom he dwelt peacefully during a number
of subsequent years. Whether children were born of this
union between the terrestrial and the ethereal is not re-
corded, and the alchemist's account of the affair reads rather
like Joe Smith's tale about receiving sacred books from an
angel on the summit of a mountain overlooking Salt Lake
City ; nor is there much to be said for two further works
from Obercit's pen, the one entitled Les Promenades de
Gamaliel, juif Philosophe, and the other La Conne.rion
Originaire des Esprits ct des Corps, d'apr~s les Prin&ipes de
Newto11 (Aug<>burg, r776). Still, if our alchemist cannot be
called an able writer, he must be bailed as a picturesque
character ; and it is matter for regret that so little i~ known
about-his life, which extended to the year 1798.
OberloD : A spirit. (See EDglaDd.)
Obsession and PossessioD : Obsession, from Latin obsessionem
--obsiders. to besiege, is a form of insanity caused, accord·
in$ to traditional belief, by the persistent attack of an
evil spirit without, this being the oppo~ite of possession,
control by an evil spirit from within, both meaning how-
ever the usurpation of the individuality and control of the
body by a foreign and discarnate entity. This belief ma}'
be found in the earliest records of human history, and in the
ma~ical rite9 and formula! ofancient religions, used as charms
against and exorcism of these invading in6uences. Indian,
Greek and Rom:~.n Literature teem with instances, the
Bible also furnishing many from the ease of Saul" troubled
with an evil spirit" only to be dispossessed by the music
of David's harping, to the miracles of Jesus Christ who
cast out legions of possessing spirits. Plato in his Republic
not only speaks of demons of various grades, but mentions
a method of treatin·g and providing for those obses!>ed by
them. Sophocles and Euripides. describe the possessed
and mention of the subject is also to be found in Herodotus,
Plutarch, Horace, and many others of the classics. Terrible
and appalling episodes in the Middle A~es are to be traced
to the unquestioned belief in the poss1bility of possession
and obsess1on by tbe Devil and his legions. All madness
was caused thereby, was indeed the visible manifestation
of the Evil One. only to be exorcised by charms, averted
by the observance of sacred rites, or later, to be burned and
destroyed bodily for the good of the tortured soul within.
'The rites of Black Magic, in all ages and places, deliberately
evoke this possession by the Devil and his demons for the
communication and benefit of the infallible knowledge it
was believed they conferred and its consequent power and
control of man and his destinies.
Modern science with its patient and laborious researches
into human psychology, has given the key to this baffiing
mystery, showing the human mind to be an incomparably
delicate instrument, peculiarly at the mercy of the per-
ceptions of the senses and their multitudinous im-
pressions on the brain, its balance so easily shaken by a
shock, a drug, a momentary excitement, oftener by pro-
longed and intense concentration upon single groups of
ideas. It is to be noted that in the hallucinatory epidemics
of all ages and countries there is to be found this unvarying
characteristic: they are connected with some dominant
cause, train of thought or religious sentiment prevalent
at the time. In the Middle Ages when there flourished
an intense belief in the positive apparitions oi angels, saints
and devils, the people's imagination was dominated and
rendered intensely dramatic thereby. The transmigration
of the human soul into animals ·was another popular belief
and to this again can be traced the terrible superstition of
Lycanthropy (q.v.) which possessed large numbers of
people in France and Germany in the fourteenth and six-
teenth centuries. The Flagellant mania took its rise at
Perouse in the thirteenth century, caused by the pattie
attendant upon an outbreak of plague. These people
maintained that there was no remission of sins without
flagellation. This they preached with t~natical fervour
and bands of them, gathering adherents everywhere, roamed
through city a.nd country, clad in scanty clothing on which
were depicted skeletons and with frenzied movements
publiclylashed themselves. It was to these exhibitions, the
nameofthe " Danceof Death " was firstapplied. The Danc-
ing mania, accompanied by aberration of mind and maniacal
distortions of the body ,.-as very prevalent in Germany ~
the fourteenth century, and in the sixteenth ccntur)l m
Italy "~'~>here it was termed ·• Tarantism" and as a va:tant
in source, was ascribed to the bite of the Tarantula sptder.
The music and songs employed for the cure are still pre-
served. Edmund Parrish in his work Hallucinati011s and
Illusio11s makes the follo\~;ng observations on this subject:
" If not reckoned as true chorea, the epidemic of dancing
which raged in Germany and the Netherlands in the Middle
Ages comes uncrer this. head. Appearing in Ai~ it spr~ad
in a few months to Liege. Utrecht and the netghbounng
towns, visited .Met:r:, Cologne and Strasburg (t4t8} a.nd
after lingering into the sixteenth century gradually ~ted
out. This malady consisted in convulsions, contortions
accompanying the dancing. hallucinations and so forth.
The attack could be checked by bandaging the abdomen ~s
well as by kicks and blows on that part of the ~Y· Mus!c
had a great influence on the dancers; and for thiS reason 1t
was played in the streets in order that the attacks might ?Y
this means reach a crisis and disappear the sooner. Qu1te
trifling circumstances could bring on these seizures, the
sight of pointed shoes for instance, and of the colour red
Obsession 300
w~ch the dancers held in horror. In order to prevent
such outbreaks the wearing of pointed shoes was forbidden
by the authorities. During their dance many of the
affiicted thought they waded in blood, or saw heavenly
visions.~'
The same author remarks on other instances:-" To
this category also belongs the histoty of demoniacal
possessio11. The belief of being possessed by spirits, fre-
quently met with in isolated cases, appeared at certain
periods in epidemic form. Such an epide~c broke out in
Brandenburg, and in Holland and Italy in the sixteenth
century, especially in the convents. In 135o-6o it attacked
the convent of St. Brigitta, in Xanthen, a convent near
Cologne, and others. The nuns declared that they were
visited by the Devil, and had carnal conversation with him.
These and other ' possessed ' wretches were sometimes
thrown into dungeons, sometimes burnt. The convent
of the Ursulines at Aix was the scene of such a drama
(1609-JI) where two possessed nuns, tormented by all
kinds of apparitions, accused a priest of witchcraft on
which charge he was burnt to death (See Grandier, Urbain).
Ti:le famous case of the nuns of Loudun (1632-39) led to a
like tragic conclusion, as well as the Louvier case {r6..p)
in which lhe two chief victims found their end in life-long
imprisonment and the stake."
The widespread belief in and fear of magic and witch-
craft operating on superstitious minds produced the most
extraordinary hallucinations. Religious ecstasy partakes
of the same character, the difference being that it is
possession by and contact with so-called good spirits. The
sacred books of all nations teem with instances of this and
profane history can also furnish examples. The many
familiar cases of ecstatic visions and revelations in the Old
Te3tament may be cited, as well as those found in the
legends of saints and martyrs, where they either appear as
revelations from heaven or temptations of the DeYil. In
the latter case, a scientific authority, Krafl't-Ebing, points
out the close connection of religious ecstasy with selCual
disturlianccs. That this condition of ·' ecstasy " was
and is sought and induced the follo.-<ing passage amply
proYes :-" Among Eastern and primitive peoples such as
Hindoos, American Indians, natives of Greenland, Kamts-
chatka and Yucatan, fetish-wvrshipping )fegroes, and
Polynesians, the ecstatic state accompanied with hallu-
cinations is frequently observed, sometimes arising spon-
taneously, but more often artificially induced. It was
known also among the nations of antiquity. The means
most often employed to induce this state arc beating of
magic drums and blowing of trumpets, howlings and hour-
long prayers, dancing, flagellation, convulsive movements
and contortions, asceticism, fasting and sexual abstinence.
Recourse is also had to narcotics to bring about the desired
result. Thus the Jlyagaric is used in Western Siberia, in
San Domingo the herb coca, tobacco by some tribes of
American Indians, and in the East opium and hashish. The
ancient Egyptians had their intoxicating drinks, and
receipts for witch's salves and philtres have come down
to us from medi:eval times." In many countries this
condition or possession is induced for religious and prophetic
purposes, also for mere fortune-telling. The extent to
which this belief in obsession and possession obtains
at the present day is testified by Tylor in Primitive
Culture :-" It is not too much to assert that the doctrine
of demoniacal possessim: is kept up, substantially the same
theory to account for substantially the same facts, by
half the human race, who thus stand as consistent repre-
sentatives of their forefathers back in primitive antiquity."
In the cults of Modern Spiritualism and Theosophy it may
be found as a leading tenet of their creeds. The obsessional
theory is used to account for all forms of insanity and
Obsession
crime. The following passage taken from the publication
of a modern seer Diakka and /heir Victims by A. J. Davis
indicates this modern belief :-" The country of the diakka
is where the morally deficient and the afl'ectionately
unclean enter upon a stran~e probation..... They are
continually victimizing sensttive persons still in the flesh
making sport of them and having a jolly laugh at the
expense of really honest and sincere people. They (these
demon-like spirits) teach that they would be elevated .and
made happy if only they could partake of whiskey and
tobacco, or gratify their burning free-love propensities.....
Being unprincipled intellectualities their play is nothing
but pastime amusement at the expense of those beneath
their influence." These creatures are also said to be of a
malignant and blood-thirsty nature, inciting the beings
tlrey possess to murder, often of a terrible character.
Signs of Demo11i1U Possession.-Melanchthon, in one of
his letters, says that though there may occasionally be
some natural causes for a frenzy or mania, it is also quite
certain that devil'\ enter certain persons and there cause
torment and fury with or without natural causes, just
as one sees at times maladies cured with remedies which
are not natural. Movoovcr, such spectacles are in the
nature of wonder:; and forecasts of things to come. Twelve
years before a woman of Saxony, who could neither read
nor write, being controlled by a devil, spoke, after the
torment was over, words in Greek and Latin to the efl'cct
that there would be great distress among the people.
Dr. Ese gives the following as possible signs of pos-
session:-
i. Imagining oneself possessed.
ii. Leading an evil life.
iii. Living alone.
iv. Chronic ailments, unusual symptoms, a deep
sleep, the vomiting of strange things.
v. Blaspheming and frequent reference to the Devil.
vi. Making a compact \\<lth the Devil.
vii. Being controlled by spirits.
Yiii. Having a face that inspires horror and fear.
ix. Being tired of living and the giving up of hope.
x. Being enraged and violent in action.
xi. Making the cries and noises of a beast.
In an account of those possessed in Loudon, we find the
questions put to the University of :\fontpellier by Santerre,
priest and founder of the bishopric and diocese of Nimes
touchin~ on the signs and tbe judicial answers of this
Universtty.
Q.-Whether the bending and moving cf the body, the
head at times, touching the soles of the feet, with other
contortions and strange positions are good signs of pos-
session J
A.-Mimics and acrobats make such strange movements,
bending and twisting themselves in so many ways that one
must conclude lhat there is no sort of position which men
and women cannot take up, after long practice and applica-
tion, even being able, with the ease of experience, to extend
and spread out abnormally the legs and other parts of the
body, by the extension of the nerves, muscles and tendoll-
such performances arc not without the bounds of nature.
Q.-Whether the rapidity of the movement of the head
backw~rds and forwards, touching the chest and the back,
is an infallible sign of posstssioll J
A.-This movement is so natural that nothing need be
added to what has been said about the movements oftbe
other parts of the body.
Q.-Whether the sudden S\9elling of the tongue, the
throat and the face, and the sudden changing of colour,
are sure signs of posussiou J
A.-The swelling and disturbance of the chest through
interruption are the efforts of breathing or inspiration-
Obsession 301
the normal actions in respiration-and possession cannot
be inferred from them. The swelling of the throat may
proceed from the retention of the breath and that of tlle
other parts from the melancholic vapours which are often
observed wandering through all parts of the body. Hence
it follows that this sign of possession is inadmissible.
Q.-\Vhether a feeling, stupidly heedless, or the lack of
feeling, to the point of being pricked or pinched without
complaining or moving and not even changing colour are
certain signs of p0$session ?
A.-The young Lacedemonian who allowed himself to be
bitten by a fox which he had stolen without seeming to
feel it, and those who flog themselves, even to death, before
the altar of Diana, without turning a hair, they all show
that, with resolution, pin-pricks can be endured without
.complaining. Moreover, it is certain that in the human
body, small areas 'lf skin arc met with in some persons,
which are insensitive, although the neighbouring parts may
be quite sensitive, a condition which occurs the more
frequently after some previous illness. Such a condition
kas, therefore, no bearing on possessio11.
Q.-Whether the total lack of bodily movement which,
:at the command of the exorciser, occul'S in those supposedly
possessed during, and in the middle of, their most violent
actions, is an undeniable sign of a true diabolic possession ?
A.-The movements of the parts of the body being
voluntary it is natural for well-disposed persons to move
themselves or not at will, so that such a cessation of move-
ment, if there is not entire lack of feeling, is not sufficient
ground from which to infer a diabolic possessi.on.
Q.-Wbether the yelping or noise like that of a dog,which
.comes from the chest rather than from the throat, is a
mark of possession ?
A.-Human skill adapts itself so easily to the counter-
feiting of all kinds of expressions, that persons arc met with
every day who can give perfectly the expressions, cries and
songs of all sorts of animals, and that with 'a practically
imperceptible movement of the lips. Again, many are to be
found who form their words in the stomach and they would
seem to come from some other object rather than from the
one who forms them. Such persons are called ventrilo-
quists. However, such a condition is natural, as Pasquier
shows, in Chap. 38 of his Researches, with one, Constantin,
a jester, as an example.
Q.-Whether keeping the gaze fixed on some object
without moving the eye, is a good sign of p0$session ?
A.-The movement of the eye is voluntary, like that of
the other parts of the body, and it is natural to move it or
keep it still-there is therefore, nothing of note in this.
Q.-Whcther the answers, given in l'rench, to questions
put in Latin, to those supposedly possessed, are a mark of
possession r
A.-We <J.ssert that to understand and speak languages
which one has not learnt is certainly supernatural, and
would lead to the supposition that it occurred through the
ministrations of the Devil or from some other cause beyond;
but merely to answer some questions suggests nothing
more than long practice, or that one of the number is in
league with them and able to contribute to such answers
making it appear a fallacy to say that the devils hear the
questions put to them in Latin and answer in French and
in the tongue natural to the one who is to pass for the
demoniac. If follows from this that such a result does not
infer the occupation by a demon, more especially if the
questions are of few words and not involved.
Q.- Whether the vomiting of such things as one has
swallowed is a sign of possession ?
A.-Delrio, Bodin. and other authors say that by witch
craft, sorcerers sometimes manage to vomit nails, pins, and
~ther strange things, by the work of the devil, who lS able
Obsession
to do the same for the truly possessed. But to vomit
things one has swallowed is natural, there being pP.ople with
weak stomachs who keep down for several hours what they
have swallowed and then return it as they have taken it;
also the lientery returns food through the bowel as it has
been taken by the mouth.
Q.-Whethcr pricks with a lancet, in different parts c.f
the body, without the drawmg of blood, are a good sign of
possession ?
A.-This is related to the composition of the melancholic
temperament, in which the blood is so thick that it cannot
issue from such small wounds and it is because of this that
many when pricked by the surgeon's lancet, even in their
very veins, do not bleed ~ drop, as is shown by experience.
There is thus nothing extraordinary here.
Recorded Incidents of Possession.-Bouloese tells how
twenty-six devils carne out of the body of the possc!>.~ed
Nicoli, of I:aon: "At t\'o o'clock in the afternoon, the said
Nicoli, being possessed of the Devil, was brought to the
said church, where the said de Motta proceeded as before
with the exorcism. In spite o1 all entreaty the said Beelze-
bub told them in a loud voice that he would not come out.
Returning to their entreaties after dinner, the said de
Motta asked him how many had come out, and he answered,
1
twenty-six.' ' You and your followers,' then said de
Motta, 1
must now come out like the others.' 1
No,' he
replied,' I will not come out here, but if you like to take me
to Saint Restitute, we will come out there. It is sufficient
for you that twenty-six are out.' Then the said de Motta
asked for a convincing sign of how they had come out. For
witness he told them to look in tbc garden of the treasury
over the front gate, for they h:\d taken and carried away
th:ree tufts (i.e. branches) from a green may-pole (a small
fir) and three slates from above the church of Liesse, made
into a cross, as others in France commonly, all of which
was found true as shown by the Abbot of Saint-Vincent,
M. de Velles, Master Robert de May, canon of the Church
Notre-Dame of Laon, and others.''
The same author gives an account of the contortions of
the demoniac of Laon : he says :-" As oftenas the re\'erend
father swung the sacred host before her eyes, saying,
' Begone, enemy of God.' so did she toss from side to side,
twisting her face towards her feet, and making horrible
noises. Her feet were reversed, with the toes in the
position of the heel, and despite the restraining power of
eight or the men, shestiffened hersel! and threw herself into
the air a height of six feet, the stature of a man, so that the
attendants, sometimes even carried with her into the air,
perspired at their work. And although they bore down
with all their might, still could they not restrain her, and
tom away from the restraining hands, she freed herself
without any appearance of being at all ruffled.
" The people, seeing and hearing such a horrible sight,
one so monstrous, hideous and terrifying cried out, ' Jesus,
have mercy on us ! ' Some hid themselves, not daring to
look ; others, recognising the wild cruelty of such excessive
and incredible torment, wept bitterly, reiterating piteously,
Jesus, have mercy on us I' The reverend father then
gave permissi(!n to those who wished to touch and handle the
patient, disngured, bent, and deformed, and with the
rigidity of death. Chief among these were the would-be
reformers, such men as Francois Santerre, Christofie,
Pasquot, Gratian de Ia Roche, Masquette, Jean du Glas,
a,nd others well-known for their tendencies towards reform,
all vigorous men. They all endeavoured, but in vain, to
straighten her limbs, and bring them to a normal position,
and to open her eyes and mouth- it was futile. Further,
so stiff and rigid was she, that the limbs would have broken
rather than give, as also the nose and ears. And then, as
she said afterwards, she was possessed, declaring that she
Obsession 302
was enduring incredible pain. That is, by the soul tor-
ment, the devil makes the body become stone or marble."
Jean Le Breton gives the following concerning those
possessed in Louviers :-
" The fourth fact is that man}' times a day they show
transports of rage and fory, during wbch they call them-
selves demons, without, however, offending anyone or even
hurting the fingers of the priests, which were put into their
mouths at the height of their fury.
"Th~ fifth is that during these furies the}' show strange
convulsions and contortions, bending themselves back,
among other things, in the form of a circle, without the
use of the hands. and in such a way that their bodies are
supported as much on the forehead as on the feet. The
rest of the body is unsupported and remains so for a long
time-the position being repeated seven or eight times.
After such feats as this and many others, kept up some-
times for four hours, chiefly during the exorcism and during
the warmest parts of the dog days, they are found on
coming to, to be as normal, as fresh and with a pulse as
even as if nothing bad happened to them.
"The sixth is that some of them faint away at ";n during
the exorcism and this condition occurs at a time when the
face is the most suffused with blood and the pulse is the
strongest. They come to of themselves and the recovery is
more remarkable than the swooning-it begins as a move-
ment of the toe. then of the foot and in their order, of the
leg, thigh, abdomen, chest and throat, the movement of the,
last three being one of wide dilation. The face, meanwhile
is apparently devoid o£ expression, which finally returns
with grim:'!.ces and sh•
.,utings, the spiritual element returning
at the same time with its former disturbing contortions."
Doctor Ese gives the following as the case of Sister l\Iary,
of the Convent at Louviers :-
,, The last was Sister Mary of St. Esprit, supposedly
possessed by Dagon, a large woman, slender-waisted, and
of good complexion, with no evidence of illness. She came
into the refectory.... head erect and eyes wandering from
side to side, singing, dancing and skipping. Still moving
about and touching lightly those around her, she spoke
with an elegance of language expressive of the good feeling
and good nature which were hi!. (using the person of the
devil.) All this was done with movements and carriage
alike haughty, following it up with a violence of blasphemy.
then a reference to his dear little friend Magdalen, his
darlin9 and his favourite mistress. And then, without
springmg. or using effort of any kind, she projected herself
into a pane of glass and hanging on to a central bar of iron
passed bodily through it, but on making an exi+; from the
other side the command was given in Latin, ' est in nomine
Jesu rediret non per aliam sed per eadem viam.' After
some discussion and a definite refus~J to return she, how-
ever, returned by the same route, whereupon the doctors
examined her pulse and tongue, all of which she endured
while laughing and discussing other things. They found no
disturbance such as they had expected, nor any sign of the
violence of her actions and words. her coming to being
accompanied with some trivial remarks. The company
then retired."
Another writer on those possessed in Louviers gives the
following astonishing fact :-
.. Placed in the middle of the nave of this chapel was a
vase ofsome kind of marble, some two feet in diameter and a
little under a foot deep, with sides about three fingers'
breadth in thickness. So heavy was it that three of the
most robust persons would have had difficulty in raising it
while on the ground, yet this girl, to all appearances of very
low vitality, came into the chapel and grasping the vase
merely by the ends of her fingers, raised it from the pedestal
on \vhich it was placed, turned it upside down and threw
Obsessioll
it on to the ground with as much ease as if it had been a
piece of cardboard or paper. Such great strength in one so
weak astonished all those present. ~!Qreover, the girl,
appearing \\ild and possessed, ran· hither and thither "ith
mo,·ements so abrupt and violent that it was difficult to
stop her. One of the clerics present, ha,·ing caught her bv
the arm. was surprised'to find that it did notprevent the reS't
of her body from turning over and over as if the arm were
fixed to the shoulder merely by a spring. This wholly
unnatural performance was carried out some seven or eight
times and that \vith an ease and speed difficult to imagine."
The Relaliou des Urs11lines possedles d' A uxonne contains
the following :-
" }1. de Chalons was no sooner at the altar (at midnight)
than from the garden of the monastery and around the
house wa~ heard a confused noise, accompanied by un-
known voices and some whistling ; at times loud cries
"ith strange and indistinct sounds as from a crowd, all
of which was rather terrifying among the shadows of the
night. At the same time stones were thrown from different
places against the windows of the choir where they were
celebrating holy mass and this despite the fact that these
windows were a good distance from the walls which enclosed
the monastery which made it improbable that they came
from without. The glass was broken in one place but the
stone did not fall into the choir. This noise was heard by
several persons, inside and out. The sentinel in t be
citadel on that side of the town took alarm at it as he said
the next day. and at the altar the bishop of Chalons could
not but feel a suspicion .that something extraord-inary was
going on in the house and that demons or so:cerers were
maldng some attempts al that moment which he repelled
from .vhere he \~as by secret imprecations and inward
exorcisms."
" The Franciscan nuns of the same town heard the noise
and were terrified by it. They thought that the monastery
shook beneath them and in this confusion and fear they were
compelled to have recourse to prayer.''
" At the same time voices were heard in the garden, weak
and moaning and as if asking for help. It was nearly an
hour 'after midnight and very dark and stormy. Two
clerics were sent out to see what v.as the matter and found
::\Iarguerite Constance and Denise Lamy in the monastery
garden, the former up a tree and the latter seated at the
foot of the stairway into the choir. They were at liberty
and in the full possession of their senses, yet appeared dis·
tracted. especially the latter, and very weak and pale,
though with blood on her face : she was terrified and had
difficulty in composing herself. The other had blood on her
face also though she was not wounded. The doors of the
house were tightly closed and the walls of the garden were
some ten or twelve feet high."
" In the ;ifternoon of the same day the bishop of Chalons,
with the intention of exorcising Denise Lamy, sent for her
and when she was not found, he inwardly commanded her to
come to him in the chapel of St. Anne where he \\as. It
was striking to see the prompt obedience of the demon to
this command, formulated merely in the mind, for in about
a quartcr of an hour a violent knocking was beard at the
door of the cha,Pel, as if by one hard pressed. On opening
the door this gul entered the chapel abruptly, leaping and
bounding, her face changed greatly and with high colour
and sparkling eyes. So bold and violent was she that it
was difficult to re~train her, nor would she allow the puttin~;
on of the stole which she seized and threw violently in•~
the air despite the efforts of four or five clerics who did
their be3t m stop her, so that finally it v.as proposed to
bind, her, but this was deemed too difficult in the condition
in which she was."
"On another occasion, at the height of her frenzy.....
Obsession 303
the demon was ordered to stop the pulse in one of her arms,
and it was immediately done, with less resistance and pain
than before. Immediate response was ::'.lso made to the
further order to m<1ke it return. The command being
given to make the girl insen~ible to pain, she avowed that
she was so, boldly offering her arm to be pierced and burnt
as wished. The exorcist, fortified by his earlier experience,
took a sufficiently long needle and drove it, fuU length, into
the nail and flesh, at wnich she laughed aloud, saying that
she felt nothing at all. Accordingly as he was ordered,
blood was allowed to flow or not, and she herself took the
needle and stuck it into different parts of her arm and
hand. Further, one of the company took a pin and, having
drawn out the skin a little above the wrist, passed it through
and through so that the two ends were only visible, the
rest of the pin being buried in the arm. Unless the order
was given for some no blood issued, nor was tht"re the
least sign of feeling or pain."
The sante account gives, as proofs of the possessio" of the
Auxonne nuns, the following :-
·• Violent agitation of the body only conceivable to those
who have seen it. Beating of the head with all their might
against the pavement or walls, done so often jl.nd so hard
that it causes one to shudder on seeing it and yet they
show no sign of pain, nor is there any blood, wound or
contusion.
" The condition of the body in a position of extreme
violence, where they support themselves on their knees with
the head turned round an inclined towards the ground for a
foot or so. which makes it appear as if broken. Their
power of bearing, for hours together without moving, the
head being lowered behind below the level of the waist ;
their power of breathing in this condition; the unrufBed
expression of the face which never alters during these
disturbances ; the evenness of the pulse; their coolness
durin~ these movements; the tranquil state they are in
when they suddenly return and the lack of any quickening
in the respirations; the turning back of the head, even to
tt.e ground, with marvellous rapidity. Sometunes the
movement to and fro is done thirty or forty times running,
the girl on her knees and with her arms crossed in front;
at other times. in the same position with the head turned
about, the body is wound around into a. sort of semicircle,
with results apparently incompatible with nature."
"Fearful convulsions, affecting all the limbs and accom-
panied with shouts and cries. Sometimes fear at the
sight of certain phantoms and spectres by which they say
they are menaced, causes such a change in their facial
expression that those present are terrified ; at other times
there is a flood of tears beyond control and accompanied
by groans and piercing cries. Again, the widely-opened
mouth, eyes wild and showing nothing but the white, the
pupil being turned up under cover of the lids-the whole
returning to the normal at the mere command of the
exorcist in conjunction with the sign of the cross.
" They have often been seen creeping and crawling on the
ground without any help from the hands or feet; the back
of the head or the forehead may he touching the soles of
the feet. Some lie on the ground, touching it with the pit of
the stomach only, the rest of the body, head, feet and arms,
being in the air for some length of time. Sometimes, bent
back so that the top of the head and the soles of the feet
touch the ground, the rest of the body being supported in
the air like a table, they walk in this position without help
from the hands. Tt is quite common for them, while on
their knees to kiss the ground, with the face twisted to the
back so that the top of the head touches the soles o£ the
feet. ln this position ancl with the arms crossed on the
chest they make the sign of the cross on the pavement v.ith
their tongues.
Obsession
" A marked difference is to be noticed between their
condition when free and uncontrolled and that'which they
show when controlled and in the heat of their frenzy. By
reason of their sex and delicate constitutions as much as
from illness they may be weak, but when the demon enters
them and the authority of the church compels them to
appear they may become at times so violent that all the
power of four or five men may be unable to stop them.
Even their faces become so distorted and changed that
they are no longer recognisable. What is more astonishing
is that after these violent transports, lasting sometimes
three or four hours ; after efforts which would make the
strongest feel like resting for several days; .after continuous
shrieking and heart-breaJ<ing cries; when they become
normal again-a momentary proceeding-they are un-
wearied and quiet, and the mind is as tranquil, the face as
composed, the breathing as easy and the pulse as little
changed as if they had not stirred out of a. chair.
" It may be said, however, that among all the signs of
possession which these girls have shown, one of the most
surprising, and at the same time the most common, is
the understanding of the thought and inward commands
which are used every day by exorcists and priests, without
there being any outward manifestation either by word or
other sign. To be appreciated by them it is merely necess-
ary to address them inwardly or mentally, a fact which
has been verified by so many of the experiences during
the stay of the bishop of Chalons and by any of the clergy.
who "\1\oished to investigate, that one cannot reasonably
doubt such particulars and many others, the details of
which cannot be given here. "
A number of archbishops or bishops and doctors in
Sorbonne made the following notification with regard to
the condition at Auxonne.
" That among these differently-placed girls there are
seculars, novices, postulants and professed nuns ; some
are young, others old ; some from the town, othecs not ;
some of high estate, others of lesser parentage ; some
rich, othecs poor and of low degree. That it is ten years
or more since the trouble began in this monastery ; that
it is remarkable that a reign of deceit was able for so long
to preserve the secret among girls in such numbers and of
conditions and interests so varied. That after research
and a stricter enquiry, the said :Bishop of Chalons has
found nobody, either in the monastery or in the tovm, who
could speak other than well of the innocf'nCe and integrity,
alike of the ~iris and of the clergy who worked with him
in the exorcisms, and, for himself, he .finds them with the
bearing of persons of uprightness and worth-evidence
which he gives in the interest of truth and justice."
" Added to the above is the certificate of Morel, doctor
and present at everything, who asserts that all these things
exceed the bounds of nature and can only occur as the
work llf a demon; in short, we consider that all the extra-
ordinary .findings with these girls are beyond the powers
of human nature and can only be instigated by a demon
possessing and controlling their bodies."
Goulart culls from Vlier many stones of demon.iacs.
" Antoine Benivenius in the eighth chapter of the Livre
des causes cackles des maladies tells of having seen a girl of
sixteen years whose hands contracted curiously whenever
she was taken with a pain in the abdomen. With a cry of
terror her abdomen would swell up so much that she had
the appearance of being eight months pregnant-later the
swelling went down aud, not being able to lie still, she
tossed about all over the bed, sometimes putting her feet
above her head as if trying a somersault. This she kept
up throughout the throes of her illness and until it had
gone down by degrees. When asked what had happened
to her, she denied any remembrance of it. Bu~ on seeking

the causes of this affection we were of opinion that it arose
from a choking of the womb and from the rising of malig-
nant vapours affecting adversely the heart and brain. VIe
were at length forced to relieve her with drugs but these
were of no avail and becoming more violent and congested
she at last began to throw up long iron nails all bent, brass
needles stuck into wax, and bound up with hair and a part
of her breakiast--a mass so large that a man would have
had difficulty in swallowing it all. I was afraid, after
seeing several of these vomitings, that she was possessed
by an evil spirit, who deluded those present while he
removed these things and afterwards we heard predictions
and other things given which were entirely beyond human
comprehension.''
" Meiner Clath, a nobleman living in the castle of Bouten-
brouch in the duchy of Juliers, had a valet named William
who for fourteen years had had the torments of a pos-
session by the devil, and when, at the instigation of the
devil, he began to get ill, he asked for the cure of St. Gerard
as confessor..... who came to carry out his little part....
but failed entirely. Seeing him with a swollen throat and
discoloured face and with the fear of his suffocating, Judith,
wife of Clath and an upright woman, with all in the house,
began to pray to God. Immediately there issued from
William's mouth, among other odds and ends, the whole
of the front part of the trousers of a shepherd, stones, some
whole and other broken, small bundles of thread, a peruke
such as women are accustomed to use, needles, a piece of
the serge jacket of a little boy, and a peacock's feather
which William had pulled from the bird's tail eight days
before he became ill. Being asked the cause of his trouble
he said that he had met a woman near Camphuse who had
blown in his faoc and that his illness was the result of that
and nothing else. Some time after he had recovered he
contradicted what he had said and confessed that he had
been instructed by the devil to say what he had. Headded
that all those curious things bad not been in his stomach
but had been put into his throat by the devil despite the
fact that he was seen to vomit them. Satan deceives by
illusions. The thought comes at times to kill oneseU or
to run away. One day, having got into a hog-shed and
protected more carefully than usual be remained with his
eyes so firmly closed that it was impossible to open them.
At lao;t Gertrude, the eldest daughter of Clath, eleven years
old, came along and ad,·ised him to pray to God for the
return of his sight, but he asked her to pray and the fact
of her praying, to the great surprise of both, opened his
eyes. The devil exhorted him often not to listen to his
mistress or anvonc else who bowed the head at the name
of God, who could not help him as he had died once, a fact
which was openly preached."
" He had once attempted rudely to touch a kitchen-
maid and she had reproved him by name, when he answered
in a voice of rage that his name was not William but Beel-
zebub, at which the mistress asked-' Do you think we fear
you? He Whom we serve is infinitely more powerful
than you are. Clath then read the eleventh chapter of
St. Luke where mention is made of the casting out of the
dumb devil by the power of the Saviour and also of Beel-
zebub, prince of devils. Finally William began to rest
and slept till morning like a man in a swoon, then taking
some broth and feeling much relieved he was sent home to
his parents, after having thanked his master and mistress
and asked God to reward them for the trouble they had
been caused by his affliction. lie married afterwards and
had children, but was never again tormented by the devil."
On the 18th March, 1566, there occurred a mem-:>rable
case in Amsterdam, Holland, on which the Chancellor of
Gueldres, :\f. Adrian Nicolas, made a public speech, from
which is the following :-" Two months or so ago thirty

child~en of this lown ~gan to be strangely disturbed, as if
frenzted or mad. At mtervals they tbrev. themselves on
the ground and for half an hour or an hour at the most
this torment lasted. Recovering, they remembered noth-
ing, but thought they had had a sleep and the doctors
sorcerers, and exorcists were all equally unable to do any
good. During the exorcism the children vomited a number
of pins and needles, finger-stalls for sewing. bits of cloth,
and of broken jugs and glass, hair and other things. The
children didn't always recover from this but had recurrent
attacks of it-the unusualness of such a condition causing
great astonishment."
Jean Languis, a learned doctor, gives the foiJo,ving, in
the first book of his Epitres, as having happened in 1539 in
Fugenstall, a village in the bishopric of Eysteten and sworn
to by a large number of witnesses:-
"Ulric Neusesser,_ a ploughman in this village, was greatly
troubled by a pain m the side. On an incision being made
into the skin by a surgeon an iron nail was removed, but
this did not relieve the pain, rather did it increase so that,
becoming desperate, the J?OOr man finally committed
suicide. Before burying htm two surgeons opened his
stomach, in front of a number of persons, and in it found
some long round pieces of wood, four steel knives, some
sharp and pointed, others notched like a saw, two iron
rods each nine inches long and a large tuft of hair. One
wondered how and by what means this mass of old iron
could be collected together into the space of his stomach.
There is no doubt that it was the work of the devil who is
capable of anything which will maintain a dread of him."
" Antoine Lucquet, knight of the order of the Fleece,
of high repute throughout Flanders, and privy counsellor
of Brabant, had married in Bruges, and his wife, soon
after the nuptials, began to show the torments of an evil
spirit, so much so that at times, even in company, sbe
was suddenly taken up and dragged through rooms and
thrown from one corner to another, despite the efforts of
those around to restrain and hold her. She was little
conscious of her bodily welfare while in this frenzy and it
was the general opinion that her condition had been induced
by a former lover of her young and light-hearted husband.
Meanwhile she became pregnant without a cessation in the
evil torment and the time of her delivery being at hand the
only woman present was sent for the midwife but instead,
she came in and herself acted as midwife which disturbed
the invalid so much that she fainted. She found, on
recovering, that she had been delivered, yet to the aston-
ishment of both there w:1s no sign of a child. The next
day on wakening up she found a chil•i in swaddling clothes
in the bed and she nursed it a couple of times. Falling
asleep shortly 'l.fterwards the child was taken from her
side and was never seen again. lt was reported that notes
with the hall-mark of magic had been found inside the
door."
Goulart gives an account from Wier, of the multitude of
terrible convulsions suffered by the nuns of the convent of
Kentorp ncar Hammone, " fust before and during the
attack their breath was fretid and sometimes continued
so for hours. While affected they did not lose their power
of sound judgment nor of hearing and recognising those
around them, despite the fact that owing to the spasm of
the tongue and respiratory organs they could not speak
during the attack. All were not equally affected but as
soon as one was affected the others, though in different
rooms, were immediately affected also. A soothsayer, who
was sent for, said they had been poisoned by the cook,
Else Kamense, =1nd the devil taking advantage of the
occasion increased their torment, making them bite and
strike each other and throw each other down. After Else
and her mother had been burnt some of the inhabitants
Obsession 305
of Ham:none began to be tormented by an evil spirit.
The minister of the Church took five of them home to warn
them and strengthen them against the machinations of the
enemy. They laughed at him and mentioned certain
women of the place whom they would like to visit on their
goats, which were to carry them there. Immediately one
straddled a stool calling out that he was off, while another,
squatting down, doubled himself up and rolled towards
the door of the room which opened suddenly and through
wh.icb be went falling to the bottom of the steps without
hurting himself."
" The nuns of the Convent of Nazareth at Cologne
(according to the same writer) were affected much the
same as those of Kentorp. After being troubled for along
time and in various ways by the devil they were more
-terribly affected in "1564 when they would lie out on the
ground, with clothing disordered, as if for the companion-
ship of man. During this their eyes would ·be closed and
they would open them later with shame and feeling that
they had endured some deep injury. A young girl of
fourteen named Gertrude who had been shut up in this
convent was subject to this misfortune. She had often
been troubl<'d by wild apparitions in bed as witness her
mocking laughter, although she tried in vain to overcome
H. A companion slept near her specially to protect her
from the apparition but the poor ~irl was terrified at the
noise from Gertrude's bed, the devtl finaJI.y controlling the
latter and' putting her through a variety·of contortions....
The beginning of all tllis trouble was in the acquaintance
picked up with one or two of the nuns on a neighbouring
tennis court by some dissolute young man who kept up
their amours over the walls."
" The torments suffered by the nuns in Wertet in the
county of Horne are also wonderful. The beginning is
traced to a poor woman who borrowed from the-nuns during
Lent some three pounds of salt and returned double the
amount before Easter. From that they began to find in
their dormitory small white balls like sugar-plums, and
salt to the taste, which they d.id not eat, nor did they know
whence they came.. Shortly after they beard a moaning
as of a sick man, then warnings to rise and go to the help
of a sic.Jcsister, which they would do but would find nothing.
Sometimes in cndcavounng to use a chamber it would be
pulled away suddenly with a consequent soiling of the bed.
At times they were pulled out by the feet, dragged som6
length, and tickled so much on the soles of the feet that
they nearly died with laughter. Pieces of flesh were
pulled out of some, while others had their legs, arms and
heads twisted about. Thus tormented some would throw
up a large quantity of black fluid, although for six weeks
previously they had taken nothing but the juice of horse-
radish without 'bread. This fluid was so bitter and so
shal:p that it blistered their mouths and one could evolve
nothing which woutd give them an appetite for anything
else. Some were raised into the air to the height of a man
and as suddenly thrown to the ground again. When some
thirty of their females visited this convent to congratulate
those who seemed relieved and practically cured, some of
them immediately fell backwards from the table they were
at, losing the power of speech and of recognising anyone,
while others were stretched out as if dead with arms and
legs turned around. One of them was raised into the air
against the restraining efforts of those present and then
brought again to the ground so forcibly that she seemed
dead. She rose, however, as if from a deep sleep and left
the convent uninjured. Some moved about on the fronts
of their legs as i£ lacking feet and as if dragged in a loose
sack from behind. Others even climbed trees like cats
;~.nd came down as easily. The Abbess told Margaret,
Countess of Bure, that she cried aloud when pinched in the
Obsession
leg ; it was as severe as if a piece had been pulled out, and
that she was carried to bed at once and the place became
black and blue, but she finally recovered. This derange-
ment of the nuns was an open secret for three years but
has been kept dark since."
" \'Vhat we have ju!.t said applies equally to the early
case of the B1idget nuns in their convent ncar Xantbus.
Now, they gambol or bleat Like sheep or make horrible
noises. Sometimes they were pushed from their scats in
church where their veils would be fastened above their
heads. At other times their throats would be so stopped
up that they could swallow no food, and this aflliction
lasted for ten ,years in some of them. It was said that the
cause of all this was a young nun whose parents bad
refused to allow her to marry the young man she loved
Further that the devil in the form of this young !nan had
come to her at the height of her passion and bad advised her
to return to the convent which sbe did at once and when
there she becDme frenzied and her actions were strange and
terrible. The trouble spread like the plague through the
other nuns, and the first one abandoned herself to her
warder and had two children. Thus does Satan·both within
and without the convent, carry out his hateful schemes."
" Cardan relates that a ploughman. . .. often threw up
glass, nails and hair and, on recovering, felt within a large
quantity of broken glass which made a noise like that from
a sackful of broken glass. This noise he said troubled
him greatly and for some eighteen nights towards seven
o'clock, although be had not observed the time and althcugb
he had felt cured for some eighteen years, be had felt blows
in his heart to the number of hours which were to strike.
All this he bore not without great agony."
"1 have often seen," says Goulart, "a demoniac named
George, who for thirty years on and of! was tormented by
an evil spirit and often I have seen her swell up, and become
so heavy that eight strong men could not rai5e her from the
ground. Then, exhorted and encouraged in the name of
God and the hand of some good man extended to her, she
would rise to her feet and return home, bent and groaning.
She did harm to no one whether by day or night while in
this condition, and sbe lived with a relative who had a
number of children so used to her ways that when they saw
her twisting her arms, striking her hands and her body
swelling up in this strange way, they would gather in som.e
part of the house and commend her to God and the1r
prayers were never in vain. Finding her one day in
another house of the village in wbich she lived I exhorted
her to patience... She began to roar in a strange way and
with a marvellous quickness shot out her left hand at me
and enclosed io it my two hands, holding me as firmly as
if I had been bound with stout cords. I tried, but in vain,
to free myself, although 1 am of average strength. She
interfered with me in no. other way nor did she touch me
with her ri~bt hand. I was held as long as it has taken. to
tell the inctdent and then she let me go suddenly, begging
my pardon, and I commended her to God and led her
quietly home.. .. Some d11ys before her death being much
tormented she went to bed with a low fever. The fury of
the evil one was then so much curtailed that the patient,
wonderfully strengthened inwardly, continued to praise
God who had been so mercifol to her in her affliction and
comforting all who visited her: ... I may add.tbat Satan
\9'as overcome, and that she died peacefully, calling on her
Saviour."
According to Goulart " there was, in the village of
Leuenstect and duchy of Brunswick, a youn~ girl of twenty
years, Margaret Achels, who lived with her SISter. Wishing
to clean some shoes one day in June she took a knife some
six inches long and sat down in a corner of the room for she
was still weak from a fever of long standing, whereupon au
Obsession 306 Olcott
olJ woman entered and inquired how she was and whether
she still had the fe,·er and then left "ithoul further words.
After the shoes were cleaned she let the knife fall in her
lap but subsequently could not fmd it despite a diligent
search. The girl 'vas frightened and still more so "hen
she found a black dog under lhc table. She drove it out,
hoping to find the knHe, but the dl)g got augry, showed its
teeth and growlingly made its way into the street and fied.
The girl at once seemed to feel something indefinable which
passed down her back like a chiU and fainting suddenly she
remained so for three days when she began to breathe
better and to take a little food. When carefully questioned
as to the cause of her illness she said that the knife which
bad fallen into her lap had entered her left side and that
there she felt pain. Although her parents contradicted
her, attributing her condition to a melancholic disposition,
her ion;; abstinence and other thing~. she did not cease to
complain, to cry and to keep a contmuous watch. so much
so that her mind became deranged and sometimes for
two days at a time she would take nothing even when
ldndly entreated to do so, so that sometimes force had to be
used. Her attacks were more severe at times than others
and her rest was broken by the continuous pains which beset
her, being forced as sh<! was to hold herself doubled over a
stick. What increased her pain and lessened the chance of
relief was her firm belief that the knife was buried in her
body and the stubborn contradiction of the others who
said it was impossible and thought it nothing but a phantom
of the mind, since they saw nothing which would gi,'e them
ground for believing her unless it were her continual com-
plaints and tears. These were kept up for some months
and until there appeared on her left side between the two
false ribs a tumour as large as an egg which fluctuated in
size with the changes in her own girth. Then the girl said
to them : • Up to the present you haven't wanted to believe
that the knife was in my side, but rou will soon see now that
it is.' On the 30th June, that is after almost thirteen
months of the trouble, the ulcer which developed on her
side poured out so much material that the swelling began to
go down and the point of the knife showed and the girl
wanted to pull it out but her parent<; pre,·ented her and
sent for the surgeon of Duke Henry who was at the Casti~
of Walfbutcl. This surgeon arrived on the 4th July and
begged the curate to comfort. instruct and encourage the
girl, and to take particular note of her answers since she
was regarded as a demoniac. She agreed to be attended by
the surgeon, not without the idea that a quick death would
follow. The latter, seeing the point of the knife projecting.
~trasped it with his instruments and found that it was just
like the other iu the sheath and very much worn about lhe
middle of the blade. The ulcer was finally cured."
Goulart, quoting Melanchthon, says that ·• there was a
girl in the marquisate of Brandebourg who pulled wme
hairs off the clothing of some person and that these hairs
were at once changed into coins of the realm '~hich the girl
chewed with a horrible cracking of the teeth. Some of
these coins are kept still by persons who snatched them
away from the girl and found them real. From rime to
time this girl was much tormented but after some months
got quite well and has remained so since. Prayers, but
nothing more, arc often offered up for her."
The same author also says: " I have heard that there
was in Italy a demented woman who when controlled by a
devil and asked by Lazare Bonami for the best verse of
Virgil, answered at once :
' Discite Justitiam ;\loniti et non temnere dives.'
' That,' she added, ' is the best and most-des('n;ng verse
that Virgil every wrote; begone and don't come back here
again to try me.' "
Louise :I.Iaillat, a young demoniac who lived in 1598
losl the use of her limbs and was found to be possessed by
five demons who called themselves, wolf, cat, dog, beauty
and a griffin. At first two of these demons came out from
her mouth in the form of balls the size of the fist, the first
tire-red, the second, which was the cat, quite black; the
others left her with less violence. On leaving her they all
made a few turns round the hearth and disappeared.
Frances Secretain was known to have made tlus girl

Od Force : (See Emanations.)
Odyle (also Od, Odic Force, Odyllic Force) : The term first
used by Baron \'On Reichenbach to denote the subtle
effluence which he supposed to emanate from every sub-
stance in the universe, particularly from the stars and
planets, and from crystals, magnets and the human body.
The odyle was perceptible only to seru;itivcs, in whom it
produced ,·ague feelings of heat or cold, according to the
substance from which it radiated; or a sufficiently sensi-
tive person mi~ht perceive the odyllic light, a clear flame
of definite colour, ISSuing from the human linger-tips, the
poles of the magnet, various metals, chemicals, etc.. and
hovering like a luminous cloud over new-made graves. The
colours varied with each substance; thus silver and gold
had a white flame; cobalt, a blue ; copper and iron, a red.
The English mesmerists speedily applied Reichenbach's
methods to their own sensitives, with results that passed
their expectations. The thoroughness of Reichenbach's
experiments, and the appa•·ent soundness of his scientific
methods, made a deep impression of the public mind. The
objections of Braid, who at this time advanced his theory
of suggestion. were ignored by the protagonists of odyle.
In after years, when spiritualism had established itself in
America, there remained a group of "rational" defenders
of the movement, who attributed the phenomena of spirit-
ualism as well as those of the polter~eist to the action of
odylic force. Table-turning and rappmg were alro referred
to this emanation by many who laughed to scorn Faraday's
theory of unconscious muscular action. Others again, such
as lllr. Guppy. regarded the so-called " spirit " intelligences
producing the manifestations as being compounded of
odylic \'apours emanating from the medium, and probably
connected ,,;th an all·pcrva.ding thought·atmospt.ere-ac.
idea sufficiently like the " cosmic lluid " of the early
magnetists.
Oil, Magical : (Set Magic.)
Ointment, Witches• : l t was believed in mcdia!,·al times that
all the wonder3 performed by UJllches-l.t, changing thcm-
seh·cs into animals, being traru.ported through the air, etc.-
were wrought by anointing lhemsel\·es with a pot_ent sal\·e.
As ointments arc.still used in Oriental countries as a mea.ns
of inducing ~'isions, it is possible that something of the kind
may account for the hallucinations which the witches seem
to have experienced. Lord Verulam says, " The ointment,
that witches use, is reported to be made of the fat of child-ren,
digged out of their graves; o£ the juices of smallage, wolfe-
bane, and ciuqrre foil, mingled with the meal of fine wheat:
but I suppose that the sopoliferous medicines are likest to
do it, which are ltt!z-bane, ltemlock, mandrake, tJuxmslrade,
tobacco, opium, saffron, poplar leaves, etc."

Olcott, Colonel Renry Steel : The founder. together with
l\ladame Blavatskv, of.the movement known as Theosophy,
and president u( the Theosophical Society. Before he
identified himscl£ with this movement he was a well-known
authority on matters connected with agriculture. In 1856
he founded in America an agricultural school on the Swiss
model, was oftt'red by the American Go,·ernment the Chief
Commission<'rship of Agriculture and by the Greek Govern-
ment the Professorship of Agriculture at Athens. He was
for a time agricultural editor of Horace Greeley's Net11 York
Old Hat 307 Ooscopy
Tribune, and published three works on agriculture. When
tl1e Civil 'Var broke out he joined the Northerners, saw
active service, and was invalided home. The government
then made him Special Commissioner of the War Depart-
ment. On the cessation of the war be rctirt>d into private
life. and from 1875 till his death in 1906 taught the doctrines
of Theosophy and neo-Buddhism. On the death of Madame
Blavatsky he associated himself with Mrs. Annie Besant
as the leader of Theosophy in India. (See Theosophy.)
Old Hat used for Raising the Devil : A popular mode of
raising the devil in former times was to make a circle,
place an old hat in the centre, and repeat the Lord's Pr-ayer
backv:ards. lt was really a caricature of magical incanta-
tion.
Old man of the Mountain : (See Assassins.)
•• Old Scratch" : One of the appellations given to the Evil
One. It 1s supposed to have been derived from Skrati,
an old Teutonic faun or Satyr, half-man and half-goat, and
possessed of horns.

Om: A Sanslait word of peculiar sanctity in the Hindu
religion. It is pronounced at the beginning and end of
every lesson in the Veda, and is also the introductory word
of the Puranas. It is said in the Katha-Upanishad:
•• Whoever knows this syllable obtains whatever he
wishes." Various accounts are given of its origin; one
that it is the term of assent used by the gods, and probably
an old contracted form of the Sanskrit word evam meaning
"thus." The laws of the Manu say that the word was
formed by Brahma himself, who extracted the letters a u m
from the Vedas, one from each; and they thus explam its
mysterious power and sanctity. Om is also the name given
by the Hindus to the spiritual sun, as opposed to " SooTUj "
the natural sun.
Omar Kbayyam : (See Assassins.)
Onimaney, or the observation of the angel Uriel, is thus
performed. Upon the nails of the right hand of an un-
polluted boy or a young virgin, or the palm of the hand, is
put some oil of olives, or what is better, oil of walnuts
mingled with tallow or blacking. If money or things
hidden in the earth be sought, the face of the child must
be turned towards the east. Jf crime be inquired into, or
the knowledge of a person out of affection, towards the
south; for robbery towards the west, and for murder
towards the south. Then the child must repeat the
seventy-two verses of the Psalms, which the Hebrew kabal-
ists collected for the Urim and T hummim. These will be
found in the third book of Reuclin on the kabalistical art,
and in a treatise de verba miri/ico. In each of these verses
occurs the venerable name of four letters, and the three
lettered name of the seventy-two angels, which are referred
to the inquisitive name Schemhammaphoras, which was
hidden in the folds of the lining of the tippet of the high
priest. When the curious student has done thus much.
Saunders assures him that he •• shall see wonders," but
he omits to specify what these wonders arc. Chiromancers
give the name Onyomancy to the inspection of the natural
signs on the nails.
Onion : The Onion was regarded as a symbol of the universe
among the ancient Egyptians, and many curious beliefs
were associated v..-ith it. It was believed by them that it
attracted and absorbed infectious matters. and was usually
hung up in rooms to prevent maladies. T his belief in tlle
absorptive virtue of the onion is prevalent even at the
present day. " When a youth," says Napier, " I remember
the following story being told, and implicitly believed by
all. There was once a certain king or nobleman who was in
want of a physician, and two celebrated doctors applied.
As both could not obtain the situation, they agreed among
themselves that the one was to try to poison the other, and
he who succeeded in overcoming the poison would thus be
left free to fill the situation. They drew lots as to who
should fiJ1t take the poison. The first dose given was a
stewed toad, but the party who took it immediately applied
a poultice of peeled oni01zs over his stomach, and thus
abstracted all the poison of the toad. Two days after, the
other doctor was g~ven the otrions to eat. He ate them, and
died. It was generally believed that the poultice of
pP.eled onions laid on the stomach, or underneath the arm-
pits, would cure anyone who had taken poison."
Onomancf, it has been properly said, more correctly signifies
divination by a donkey, than by a name; and the latter
science ought to be termed Onomamancy,or Onomatomancy.
The notion that an analogy existed between men's names
and their fortunes is supposed to have originated with ti'e
Pythagoreans ; it furnished some reveries to Plato, and
bas been the Fourcc of much small wit in Ausonius, which
it may amuse the classical scholar to collate from his
epigrams.
Two leading rules in the science of Onomatrcy were first,
that an even number of vowels in a man's name signifies
something amiss in his left side ; an uneven number a
similar affection on the right; so that, between the two,
perfect sanity was little to Pe expected. Secondly, of two
competitors, that one would prove successful the numeral
letters in whose name when summed ~p exceeded the
amount of those in tbe name of his rival; and this_was
one of the reasons which enabled Achilles to triumph over
Hector.
The Gothic King, Theodotus, is said, on the authority of
Ca!lius Rhodiginus to have practised a peculiar species of
Onomancy on the recommendation of a Jew. The diviner
advised the prince, when on the eve of a war with Rome,
to shut up thirty hogs in three different styes, having
previously given some of them Roman and others Gothic
names. On an appointed day, when tlle styes were
opened, all the Romans were found alive, but with half
their bristles fallen off-all the Goths, on the other hand,
were dead ; and from this pt·ognostic the onomantist
foreboded that the Gothic army would be utterly destroyed
by the Romans. who, at the same time, would lose half
their own force.
Onycbomancy : pivination b~ the finger-na~ls. It i~ prac-
tised by watching the rcfiecbon of the sun m the natls of a
boy, and judging the future by the shape of the figures
which show themselves on their surface.
Onyx: Its properties resemble those of Jasper, besides which
it increases saliva in boys, and is said to bring terrible
shapes to the dreamer. If applied to the eye it acts as if
it were alive, by creeping about and removing anything
noxious.
Ooscopy and Oomantla. : Two methods of divination by
eggs. An example under the former name L~ related by
Suetonius, who says. that Livia. when she was anxious to
know whether she should be the mother of a boy or girl,
kept an egg in her bosom at the proper temperature, until
a chick w1th a beautiful cockscomb came forth. The
latter name denotes a method of divining the signs or
characters appearing in eggs. The custom of rasche or
paste eggs, which are ~tained with variou~ colou:-;. and
given away at Easter, 1s well known, and lS dcsc~bed at
considerable length by Brand. The custom ts most
religiously observed in Russia, where it is derived from the
Creek Church. Gilded or coloured eggs are mutually
exchanged both by men and women, who kiss one ano.ther,
and if any coolness existed previously become good friends
again on these occasions. The egg is one of the most
ancient and beautiful symbols of the new birth, and bas
•
Opal 308
been applied to natu:ral philosophy as well as the spiritual
creation of man.
Opal : Recreates the heart, preserves from contagion in the
air, and disvels sadness; it is also good for weak eyes.
Pliny's description of this stone glows with enthusiasm,
and he gives the preference to those which are shadowed
as it were with the colour of wine. The n'l.me poederos,
applied to the opal, is understood to indicate the beautiful
complexion of youth.
Ophites : This gnostic sect seems to have dated from the
second century. A full $ystem of initiation was in vogue
among the members, and they possessed symbols to
represent purity, life, spirit and fire. The whole appears
to have been of Egyptian origin. (See Gnostics.)
Oracles : Shrines where a god speaks to human beings
through lhe mouths of priests or priestesses. The con-
cept of the god become vocal in this manner was by no
means confined to Greece or Egypt. Our object here is to
deal with the most celebrated oracles of all nations as well
as those of antiquity. Probably ail the primitive gods-
those, that is to say, of the felish clas5, now under con-
sideration-were consulted as oracles ; it is certain that
they derived this cha~acter in a state of animism and that
they transmitted it to gods of the most advanced type.
In early times the great question was whether man
would .have food on the morrow or no; perhaps the first
omde was the spirit which direded the hungry savage in
his hunting and fishing expeditions. The Esquimaux still
consult spirits for this purpose, and their "izards are as
familiar with the art of gh·ing ambiguous replies to their
anxious clients as were the well·infonned keepers of the
oracles of Greece. As advancement proceeded, thedireetion
of the gods was obtained in all the affairs of private and
public life.
Greece.-The Oracle of Delphi. When Jupiter was once
desirous to ascertain the central point of the earth, he
despatched two eagles, or two crows, as they are named by
Strabo. The messengers took flight in opposite courses,
!rom sunrise and sunset; and they met at Delphi, which
place was thenceforward dignified with the title " The
navel of the earth; " an " uJDbilicus" being represented
in white marble within its celebrated temple. Delphi thus
became a place of great distinction, but it was not yet
oracular, till the fumes which issued from a neighbouring
cave were first discovered by a sr.epherd named Coretas.
His attention was forcibly attracted to a spot round which
whenever his goats were browsing they gambolled and
bleated more than was their wont. Whether these fumes
arose in consequence of an earthquake, or whether they
were generated by demoniacal art is not to be ascertained ;
but the latter hypothesis is thought by Clasen to be the
more probable of the two. Corelas, on approaching the
spot, was seized with ecstacy, and uttered words which were
deemed inspired. It was nollong before the danger arising
in consequence of the excitement of curiosity among the
neighbours, the deadly stupefaction often produced among
those who inhaled the fumes without proper caution, and
the inclination which it aroused in some to plunge them-
selves into the depths of the cavern below, occasioned the
fissure to be covered by a sort of table, having a hole in the
centre, and called a tripod, so that those who wished to
try the experiment could resort there in safety. Enmtually
a youns: girl, of unsophisticated manners, became the
chosen medium of the responses, now deemed oracular and
called Pythian, as proceeding from Apollo, the slayer of
Python, to whom Delphi was consecrated. A syh·an bower
of laurel branches was erected over the spot, and at length
the marble temple and the priesthood of Delphi arose where
the Pythoness, seated on her throne, could be charged with
Oracles
the divine " afflatus," and was thus rendered the vehicle of
Apollo's dictation.
As the oracle became more celebrated, its prophetic
machinery was constructed of more costly materials. The
tripod was then formed of gold, but the lid, whiclt was
placed in its hollow rim, in order to afford the Pythone55
a more secure seat, continued to be made of bra55. Sbe
prepared herself by drinking out of a sacred fountain
(Castalia), adjoining the crypt, the waters of which were
reserved for her only, and in which she bathed her hair ; by
chewing a laurel leaf, and by circling her brows with a
laurel crown. The person who made inquiry from the.
oracle, first offered a victim, and then having written his
question in a note-book, handed it to the Pythoness, before
she ascended the tripod; and he also as well as the priestess,
wore a laurel crown. .In early times the oracle spoke only
in one month of the year, named ·• Byssus," in which it
originated; and at first only on the seventh day of that
month, which was esteemed the birth-day of Apollo, and
was called " Polypthonus."
Virginity was at first an indispensable requhile m the
P:rthoness ; on account, as Diodorus tells us, of the purity
of that state and its relation to Diana ; moreover, because
virgins were thought better adapted than others of their
sex to keep oracular mysteries secret and inviolate. But
an untoward accident having occurred to one of these
consecrated damsels, the guardians of the temple, in
order, as they imagined, to prevent its repctitio~ for the
future, permitted no one to fulfil the duties of the office
till she had attained the mature age of fifty; they still
indulged her, however, with the use of a maiden's habit.
The response was always delivered in Greek.
Oracle of Dodona. Another celebrated oracle, that of
Jupiter, was at Dodona, in Epirus, from which Jupiter
derived the name of Dodonus. It was situated at the foo
of ~fount Tomarus, in a wood of oaks; and there the
answers were given by an old woman under the name of
Pelias. Pelias means· dove in the Attic dialect, from which
the fable arose, that the doves prophesied in the groves
of Dodona. According to Herodotus, this legend con-
tains the following incident, which gave rise to the
oracle :- Two priestesses of Egyptian Thebes were carried
away by Phomician merchants ; one of them was conveyed
to Libya, where she founded the oracle of Jupiter Ammon;
the other to Greece. The latter one remained in the
Dodouian wood, which \vas much frequented on account of
the acorns. There she had a temple built at the foot of
an oak in honour of Jupiter, whose priestess she had been
in Thebes ; and here afterwards a regular oracle was
founded. He adds, that this priestess was called a dove,
because her language could not be understood. The
Dodonid and African oracles were certainly connected, and
Herodotus distinctly states, that the manner of prophecy
in Dodona was the same as that in Egyptian 'Thebes.
Diana was worshipped in Dodona in conjunction with Zeus,
and 2. female figure was associated \\ith Amun in the
Libyan Am1nonium. Besides this, the dove was the bird
of Aphrodite, the Diana of Zeus, or the Mosaic djvine
love, which saved mankind from complete .destruction.
According to other authors, there was a wondrous intoxi-
cating spring at Dodona; and in later times more material
means were employed to produce the prophetic spirit.
Se\·eral copper bowls, namely, were placed upon a
column, and the statue flf a boy beside them. \Vhen the
wind moved a rod 01 ~courge having three bones attached
to chains, it struck upon the metallic bowls, the sound of
whi<-h was heard by the applicants. These Dodonian
tones gave rise to a proverb : as Dotional<>tl-an unceasing
babbler.
The orac•o "' Dodona was dedicated to the Pelasgian
Oraelss 309
Zeus, who was worshipped here at the same time as the
almighty. ruler of the world, and as the friendly _
associate
of mankind. In the course of the theogonic process,
Diana was associated with him as his \vife,-the mother of
Aphrodite. The servants of Zeus were Selles, the priests
of Diana, the so-called Peliades. According to Homer,
the Selles inhabited the sanctum at Dodona, sleeping upon
the earth, and with naked unwashed feet : they served the
Pelasgian ~eus. It is probable that they slept upon the
earth on the hides of newly-sacrificed animals, to recc·ive
prophetic dreams, as was customary at other places,
Calchos and Oropus, ""-ith many others.
As regards the mantic of Dodona, it was partly natural,
from the excitement of the mind, partly artificial. Of the
latter we may mention three modes-the ancient oak of
Zeus, with its prophetic doves, the miraculous spring. and
the celebrated Dodonian bowls of brass.
The far-spreading, spe;\king tree, the incredible wonder.
as JEschylus calls it, was an oak, a lofty beautiful tree,
with evergreen leaves and sweet edible acorns, which
according to the belief of the Greeks and Romans, were
the first sustenance of mankind. The Pelasgi regarded
this tree as the tree of life. In this tree the god was
supposed to reside, and the rustling of its leaves and the
voices of birds showed his presence. When the questioners
entered, the oak rustled, and the Pcliades said, " Thus
speaks Zeus." Incense was burned beneath it, which may
be compared to the altar of Abraham under the oak
Ogyges, which had stood there since the world's creation.
According to the legend, sacred dove!. continually inhabited
the tree, like the Marsoor oracle at Tiora Mattiene, where
a sacred hawk foretells futurity from the top of a \Vooden
pillar.
At the foot of the oak a cold sprin~ gushes as it were from
its ro.ots, and from its murmur the inspired priestesses
prophesied.
Of this miraculous fountain tt is related, that lighted
torches being thrust into it were extinguished, and that
extinguished torches were re-lit : il also rose and fell at
various seasons. " That extinction and rekindling has,"
says Lassaulx, " perhaps the mystical .signification that
the usual sober life of the senses must be extinguished, that
the prophetic spirit dormant in the soul may be aroused.
The torch of human existence must expire, that a divine
one may be lighted; the human must die that the divine
may be born; the destruction of individuality is the
awakening of God in the soul, or, ns the mystics say, the
setting of sense is the rising of truth."
The extinguishing of a b,.urning light shows that the
spring contained carbonic acid gas, which ~esses stupi-
fying. and deadly properties, like all exhalations arising
especially from minerals. The regular rising and sinking
of the water is a frequent phenomenon. and has been
observed from the earhcst ages.
It appears that predictions were urawn from the tones
of the Dodonian brass bowls, a.'! well as from the rustling
of the sacred oak and the murmuring of tl.te sacred well.
The Dodonian columns, with that which stood upon
them, appears to express the following :-The medium-
sized brazen bowl was a hemisphere, and symbolised of
heaven ; the boy-like male statue a figure o! the Demiurgos,
or constructor of the universe ; the bell-like notes a symbol
of the harmony of the universe and music of the spheres.
That the Demiurgos is represented as a boy is quite in the
spirit of Egypto-Pelasgian theology as it reigned in Samo-
thrace. The miraculous bell told all who cam.:to Dodona to
question the god that they were on holy ground, must
inquire with pure hearts, and be silent when the god
replied. It is easily imagined that these tones, independent
and uRinduencod by human will, must have made a deep
Oracles
impression upon the minds of pilgrims. Those who
questioned the god were al'IO obliged to take a purificatory
bath in the temple, similar to that by which the Delphian
Pythia prepared herself for prophecy.
Besides this artificial soothsaying from signs, natura}
divination by the prophetic movements of the mind was
practised. \Vhere there arc prophesying prie!<tesses, there
must also be ecstatic ones, similar to those in the magnetic
state. Sophocles calls the Dodoncan priestesses divinely
inspired: Plato (Phredru ~) says, more decidedly, that tbe
prophetess at Delphi and the priestesses at Dodona had
done much good in sacred m:\dness, in private and public
affairs. to their country, but in their"senses little or nothing.
We may see from this that the Delphian Pythia, as well as
the Dodonian priestesses, did not give their oracles in the
state of common waking consciousness, but in real ecstasy,
to which the frequent incense-and drink--offerings would
assist. Aristides states, still more clearly than the others,
that the priestesses at Dodona neither knew, before being
seized upon by the spirit, what would be said, nor remem-
bered afterwards. when their natural consciousness re-
tumed, what they had uttered ; so that all others, rather
than they, knew tt.
C>Yacle oj }ttpiter Trophonius.- Trophonius. according to
Pausanias, was the most skilful architect of his day. C'on·
eerning the origin of his or{(cle there arc many opinions.
Some say he was swallowed up by an earthquake in the
cave which afterwards became prophetic : others, that
after having completed the Aditum of Apollo at Delphi (a
very marvellous specimen o his workmanship, which
Dr. Clarke thought might at some time be discovered on
account of its singularity), he declined asking any specific
pay. but modestly requested the god to grant him what-
ever was the greatest benefit a man could receive : and in
three days afterwards he was found dead. This oracle was
discovered after two years of scarcity in its neighbourhood,
when the Pythoness ordered the starving population, who
applied to her, to consult Trophonius in Lcbad;ca. The
deputation sent for that purpose could not discover any
trace of such an oracle, till Sa.on, the oldest among them,
obtained the desired information by follo,ving the dight of
a swam\ of bees. The responses were given by the genius
of Trophonius to the inquirer, who was compelled to
descend into a. cave, of the nature of which Pausanias bas
left a very lively representation. The votary resided for a
certain number of days in a sanctuary of good fortune, in
which he underwent customary lustration.s, abstained from
bot baths, but dipped in the river Hercyna, and was
plentifully supplied with meat from the victims which he
sacrificed. Many, indeed, were the sacred personages
whom he was bound to propitiate with blood ; among them
were Trophonius himself and bis sons, Apollo, Saturn,
Jupiter, Vasileus, Juno Henioche, and Ceres Europa, who
ts -aff1rmed to have been the nurse of Trophonius. From
an inspection of the entrails, a soothsayer pronoun.ced
whether Trophonius was in fit humour for consultation.
None of the" exta," however favourable they might have
been, were of the sligbtest avail, unless a ram, immolated
to Agamedes at the mouth of the cave on the v'ery night of
the descent, proved auspicious. \\Then that propitious
signal had been given ,the priests led the inquirer to the
river Hercyna, where he was anointed and washed by two
Lebadrean youths, thirteen years of age, named " Hermai."
He wns then c.'\rried farther to the two spring-beads of the
stream, and there he dr~nk first of Lethe, in order that he
might forget aU past events and present his mind to the
oracl* as a " tabula rasa " ; and secondly of :Mnemosyne,
that he might firmly retain remembrance of every occurrence
which was about to happen within the cave. An image,
reputed to be the workmanship of Dredalus. was then
Oracles :no
exhibited to biro, and so great was its sanctity, that no
other eyes but those of a person about to undertake the
adventure of the cave were ever permitted to behold it.
Next he was clad in a linen robe, girt with ribbons, and
shod with sandals peculiar to the country. The entrance
to the oracle was a very narrow aperture in a grove on the
summit of a mountain, protected by a .marble parapet
about two cubits in height, and by brazen spikes above it.
The upper part of the cave was artificial, like an oven, but
no steps were cut in the rock, and the descent was made by
a ladder brought to the spot on each occasion. On
approaching the mouth of the adytum itself the adven-
turer lay fiat, and holding in each hand some honeyed
cakes, first inserted his feet into the aperture, then drew
his knees and the remainder of his body after them, till he
v;ras caught by some hidden force, and carried downward
as if by a whirlpool. The responses were given sometimes
by a vision, sometimes by words; and a forcible exit was
then made through the original entrance, and in like
manner feet foremost. There was only a single instance
on record of any ~person who had descended failing to
return and that one deserved his fate; for his object was
to discover treasure, not'to consult the oracle. Immediately
on issuing from the cavern, the inquirer was placed on a
seat called that of Mnemosyne, not far from the entrance,
and there the priests demanded a relation of everything
which he had seen and heard ; he was then carried once
again to the sanctuary of good fortune, where he remained
for some time overpowered by terror and lost in forget-
fulness. By degrees his former powers of intellect returned,
and, in contradiction to the received opinion, he recovere:i
the power of smiling.
Dr. Clarke, in his visit to Lebad<ea, found everything
belonging to the hieron of Trophonius in its original state,
excepting that the narrow entrance to the ad}'-t.um was
choked with rubbish. The Turkish governor was afraid
of a popular commotion if he gave permission for cleansing
this aperture. Mr. Cripps, ho\\ever, introduced the whole
l~ngth of his body into the cavity, and by thrusting a
long pole before him found it utterly stopped. The waters
of Lethe and Mnemosyne at present supply the washer-
women of Lebad<ea.
Oracles of Delos and Branchus.- The oracle of " Delos,"
notwithstanding its high reputanon, bad few peculiarities :
its virtue was derived from the nativity of Apollo and
Diz.na in that island. At Dindyma, or Didyma, near
Miletus, Apollo presided over the oracle of the " Branchi-
dre," so calledfTOmeitberoneofhissonsor of his favourites
Branchus of Thessaly, whom he instructed in soothsaying
while alive, and canonized after death. The responses
were given by a priestess who bathed and fasted for three
days before consultation, and then sat upon an axle or bar,
'\lith a charming-rod in her hand, and inhaling the steam
from a hot spring. Offerings and ceremonies were necessary
to render the inspiration effectual, including baths, fasting,
and solitude, and Iamblichus censures those who despise
them.
Oracle of the Clarian A polio aJ Coloplio:t.-0£ the oracle
of Apollo at Colophon, Iamblichus relates that it prophesied
by drinking of water. " It is known that a subterranean
spring exists there, from which the prophet drinks ; after
he has done so, and has performed many consecrations and
sacred customs on certain nights, he predicts the future;
but he is invhible to all who are pre~ent. That this water
can induce prophecy is clear, but bow it happens, no one
~o.ws, s~~s the prover~." It might appear that the
dJvtne spmt pervades this water, but it is not ~. God
i~ ~n a.ll things, an~ is reflected .~ this sp•ing, thereby
gtvmg Lt the prophetic power. This Inspiration ofthe water
is not of an entirely divine nature, for it only prepares us
Oracles
and purifies the light of the soul, so that we are f1t to receive
the divine spirit. There the divine pre!\ence is of such a
nature that it punishes every one who is capable of receiving
the god. The soothsayer uses this spirit hke a "·ork-tool
o,·er which he has no control. After the moment of pre-
diction he does not always remember that which has
passed ; often he can scarcely collect his faculties. Long
before the water-drinking, the soothsayer must abstain
day and night from food, and observe religious customs,
which z.re impossible to ordinarv people, by which means
he is made capable of receh;ng the god. It is only in this
manner that he is able f.o hold the mirror of his sont to the
radiance of free inspiration."
Oracle of AmphiaraiiS.-Another very celebrated oracle
'''as that of Amphiaraus, who distinguished himself so
much in the Theban war. He was venerated at Oropus, in
Bceotia, as a seer. This oracle was consulted more in sick-
nes~ than on any other occasion. The applicants bad here,
also, to lie upon the skin of a sacri1iced ram, and during
sleep bad the remedies of their diseases revealed to them.
Not only, however, were sacrifices and lustrations per-
formed here, but the priests prescribed other preparations
by which the minds of the sleepers were to be enlightened.
They had to fast one day, anrt refrain from wine three.
Amphilochus, as son of Amphiaraus, had a similar oracle
at Mallos, in Cilicia, which Pausanil\s calls the most trust-
worthy and credible of the age. Plutarch speaks of the
oracles of Amphilocbus and Mopsus as being in a very
ll.ourishing state ; and J.ucian mentions that all those who
wished to question the oracle had to lay down two obols:s.
Egyptian Oracles.-The oracles of Ancient Egypt were as
numerous as those of Greece. It must have been due to
{oreign influence that the oracle, that played so important
a part in the Greek world at t11is time, was also thoroughly
established on the banks of the Nile. Herodotus knew of
no fewer than seven gods in Egypt who spake by oracles.
Of these, the most reliable was considered to give an
intimation of their intentions by means of remarkabl.e
events. These are carefully observed by the Egyptians,
who write down what follows upon these prodigies. They
Cf".so consiiier that the fate of a person is fixed by the day of
his birth, for every day belongs to a special god. The
oracle of jupiter Ammon at the oasis of that name and the
same deity at Thebes existed from the twentieth to the
twenty-second Dynasty. Ho was consulted not only con-
cerning the fate of empires but upon such trifling matters
as the identification of a thief. In all serious matters,
however, it was sought to ascertain his .,;ews. Those
about to make their wills sought his oracle, and judgments
were ratifir.d by his word.
" According to the inscriptions, intercourse between
king and god was arranged as follows :-The King present
himself before the god nnd preferred a direct question, so
framed as to admit of an ans"Q.•er by simple yes or no; in
reply the god nodded an affirmative, or shook his head in
negation. This has suggested the idea that. the oracles
were worked by.manipulating statues of dh;nities mecllan-
ically set in motion by the priests. But as yet no such
statues have been found in the Valley of the Nile, and con-
trivances of this kind could have had no other object than
to deceive the people,-a supposition apparently excluded
in this case by the fact that it was customary fer the king
to visit the god alone and in secret. Probably the king
presented himself on such occasions before the sacred
animal in which the god wa.s incarnate, believing that the
di-...;ne will would be manifested by its movements."
The Apis bull also possessed oracles. Bes, too, god of
pleasure or of the senses, had an oracle at Abydos.
American Oracles.-Among the American races the
oracle was frequently encountered. All the principal gods
Oracles 311 Orton
of aboriginal America universally act as ora&les. With the
ancient inhabitants of Peru, the httilkas partook of the
n_ature of oracjes. Many of these. were se•-pents, trees, and
nvers•. the no1ses made by which appeared to the primitive
PeruVlans--ao;, indeed, they do to primitive folk all over
the world-to be of the quality of articulate speech. Both
the Huillcamayu and the Apurimac rivers at Cuzco were
h:.illca oracles of this kind, as their names, " Huillca-
rivcr" and " Great Speaker," denote. These oracles
often set the mandate of the Inca himself at dcfla:tce,
occ!lsionally supporting popular opinion against. his
policy.
The Peruvian Indians of the Andes range ·within recent
gene~atio~s continued to adhere to the superstitions they
bad 1nhcnted from their fathers. A rare and interesting
~ccou!lt of these says that they " admit an evil being, the
mhabitant of the centre of the earth, whom they consider
as the author of their misfortunes, and at the mention of
whose name they tremble. The most shrewd among
them take advantage of this belief to obtain respect, and
represent themselves as his delegates. Under the denom-
ination of moha1tes, or agtweros, they arc consulted even on
the most trivial occasions. They preside over the intrigues
of love, the health of the community, and the taking of the
:field. Whatever repeatedly occurs to defeat their prognos-
tics: falls on. themselves ; and they arc wont to pay for
the1r deceptions very dearly. They chew a species of
vegetable called piyipiri, and throw it into the air accom-
p~nying this act by certain recitals and incantations, to
IDJ~re som~, to benefit others, to procure rain and the inun-
dation of n vers, or, on the other hand, to uccasion settled
weather. and a plentiful store of agricultural productions.
Any ~uch result, having been casually verified on a sin~:le
occa.'llon, suffices to confirm the Indians in their faith,
although they may have been cheated a thousand times.
There is an instance on record of how the huillca could
refuse on occasion to recognise even royalty itself. Manco,
the Inca who had beerr given the kingly power by Pizarro,
offered a ~acri6.ce to one of these oracular shrines., The
01'acle refused to recognise him, through the medium of its
guardian priest, stating that Manco was not the rightful
Inca. ll•lanco therefore caused the oracle, which was in the
S~J?e of a rock: to be thtown down, whereupon its guardian
spmt emerged m the form of a parrot and llcw away. It is
probable that the bird thus liberated had been taught by
the priests to answer to the questions oftbose who came
to consult the shrine. But we learn that on Manco com-
manding.that the parrot should be purSued it sought anothe:r;
rock, which opened to receive it, and the spiritofthc huillca
was transferred to tbis new abode.
Like the greater idols of Mexico, most of the principal hua-
cas of Peru seem to have been also OYacles. The guardians
0~ the great speaking huacas appear to have exercised in
VITtue of their office an independent influence whtch was
sometimes sufficiently powerful to resist the Apu-Ccapac-
lnca himself. It was perhaps natural that they should be
the cxpoaents of the po}?ularfccling which supported them,
:ather ~1an of the policy of the sovereign chiefs, whose
1nterest 1t was to suppress them : there was even a tradition
that the Huillac-umu, a venerable huillac whom the rest
?-c~no~vlc;<Jged as their head, had in old times possessed
)Unsdictlon over the supreme war-chiefs.
Many Indian tribes employ fetishes as oracles, and among
the ancient Mexicans practically all the great gods were
oracular.

electrum. According to Pliny a vessel of this substance

fire. The occult qualities of electrum arc of a tell-tale
nature.

Orton : Alluded to by Froissart as the familiar of the Lord of
Corasse, ncar Orthes. A clerk whom his lordship had
wronged set this spirit the task of tormenting his superior,
but by fair words the Lord of Corasse won him over to
himself so that Orton became his familiar. Nightly (hton
would shake his pillow and waken him to tell him the news
of the world. Froissart says of their connection :-
" So Orton continued to serve the Lord of Corasse for a
long time. I do not know whether he had more than one
master, but, every week, at nig~t. twice or tJu:ice. .he
visited his master, and related to him the events which had
happened in the different countries he had traversed, and
the lord of Corasse wrote of them to the Count of Foix, who
took a great pleasure in them, for he was the man in all the
world who most willingly heard news of strange countries.
" Now it happened that the Lord of Corasse, as.on oth~
nights, was lying in his bed in bis cha~ber by the Side.of his
wife who had become accustomed to listen to Orton wtthout
any 'alarm. Orjon came, and drew away tbe lord's pillow,
forhewasfast asleep, and his lord awoke, and cried,' V.'ho
is this ? • He answered, ' It is I, Ort<m.' ' And whence
comest thou ? ' ' I come from Prague. in Bohemia.' ' And
how far from hence is this Prague, in Bohemia?' 'Why,'
said he, ' about sixty days' journey.: ' And tho~ hast
come so quickly? ' • Faith, I go as qu1ckly as the wmd. or
even swifter.' • And thou hast v.>ings?' • Faith, none.'
• How then canst thou tly so quickly ? ' Orton replied-
• It does not concern thee to know.' 'Nay,' ·said he, • 1
shall be very glad to know what fashion and form thou art
of' (hton answered, • Jt does not concern thee to know ; 1t
is'sufficient that I come hither, and bring thee sure and
certain news.' • By G--, Orton,' exclaimed the lord of
Corasse, • J should love thee better if I had seen thee.'
• Since you have ~o keen a desire to see me,' said Orton '.the
first thing thou shalt see and encounter to-morr~w. momm~.
when you rise !rom your bed, shall be-l. That . IS
enough,' said the Lord of Corasse. ' Go, therefore ; I g1ve
thee leave for this night.'
" When the morrow came, the Lord of Corasse bl)gan to
rise, but the lady was so affrighted that sh~ fell sick and
could not get up that morning, and she satd. to her lord,
who did not wish her to keep her bed, • Sec 1f thou seest
Orton. By my faith, J neither wish, if it please Cod, to sec
nor encounter him.' • But I do,' said the Lord of Corasse
He leapt all nimbly from his bed, and seated himself upon
the edge, and waited there to see Ortott, but saw nothing.
Then he went to the windows and threw them upon that he
mi~ht see more clearly about the room, but he saw nothing,
so that he could say, • Tbis is Orto1z.' The day p~sse?, the
night returned. 'When the Lord of Corasse was m hiS bed
asleep, Orton came. and began speaking in his wonted
manner. • Go, go,' said his master, ' thou art a fibber :
thou didst promise to show me to-day who thou wert, and
thou hast not done so.' • Nay,' said he, ' but I did.'
• Thou didst not.' • And didst thou not see anything;
Orton 312 Palingenesy
inquired Orton, ' when thou didst leap out p£ bed ? ' l'he
Lord of Corasse thought a little while, and .said-' Yes,
while sitting on my bed, and thinking of thee, I saw two
long straws• upon the pavement, which turned towards
each other and played about.' ' And that was I,' cried
Orton; ' I had assumed that form.' Said the Lord of
Corasse: 'It does not content me: I pray thee change
thyself into some other form. so that I may see and know
thee.' Orton replied : ' You will act so that you will lose
me.' ' Not so, 'said the Lord of Corasse: ' 'When I have
once seen you, I shall not want to see you ever again.'
' Then,' said Orton, ' you shall see me to-morrow; and
remember that the first· thing you shall see upon leaving
your chamber, will be I.' ' Be it. so,' replied the _Lord of
Corasse. ' Begone with you, therefore, now. I gtve thee
leave, for I wish to sleep.'
'' Orton departed. 'When the morrow came, and at tlie
third hour, the Lord of Corasse was up and attired in his
usual fashion, he went forth from his chamber into a
gallery that looked upon the castle-court. He cast therein
his glances, and the first thing he sa'v was the largest sow
lj.e had ever .seen ; but she was so thin she seemed nothing
but skin and bones, and she had great and long teats,
pendantand quite attenuated, and a long and inflamedsnout.
The Sire de Corasse marvelled very much at this sow, and
looked at her in anger, and exclaimed to his people, ' Go
quickly, bring the dogs hither, and see that this Sow be
well qunted.' The varlets ran nimbly, threw open the
place where the dogs lay, and set them at the so\v. The
SO\V heaved a loud cry, and looked up at the Lord of
Corasse, who supported himself upon. a pillar buttress in
front of his chamber. She was seen no more afterwards,
for she vanished, nor did any one note what became of her.
The Sire de Corrasse returned into his chamber pensively,
and bethought himself of Orton, and said, ' I think that I
have seen my familiar ; I repent me that I set my dogs
upon him, for I doubt if I shall ever behold him again,
stnce he has several times told me that as soon as I should
provoke him I should lose him, and he would return no
more.' He spoke truly ; never again did Orton return to the
Lord of Corasse, and the knight died in the following-
year.''
Ostiaks : (See Siberia.)
Oupnekhat, The : The Oupnekhat or Oupnekhata (Book of the
Secret} written in Persian, gives the follov.oing instructions.
for the production of visions. " To produce the wise-
Maschqgui (vision}, we must sit on a four-cornered base,
namely the heels, and then close ~he gates of the body.
The ears by the thumbs; the eyes by the forefingers ~
the nose by the -middle : the lips by the four other fingers.
The lamp \\oithin the body will then be preserved from
wind and movement, and the whole body will be full of
light. Like the tortoise, man must withdraw every sense
within himself; the heart must be guarded, and then Brahma
will enter into him, like fue and lightning. l'n the great
fue in the cavity of the heart a .small flame will be lit up,
and in its centreis Atma (thesoul); andbewbodestroysall
'"orldly desires and wisdom will be like a hawk which bas
broken through the meshes of the net, and will have become
one with the gc.eat being." Thus will he become Brahrna-
Atma (dhoine spirit), and v.oill perceive by a light that far
exceeds that of the sum. " Who, therefore, enters this
path be Brahma must deny the world and its pleasures ;
must only cover his nakedness, and staff in hand collect
enough, but no more, alms to maintain life. The lesser
ones only do this; the greater throw aside pitcher and.
staff, and do not even read the Oupnekhata."
Owen, Robert : An ea-rly convert to spiritualism. He had
been for many years an advanced socialist, and though at
the time he embraced the spiTitualistic doctrines-1853-
he was already in his eighty-third year, be preached the-
new faith with undiminished vigour and with characteristic
scorn of caution. Having first published his views in his
periodical, the Rational Quarterly Review, he brought out,
in 1854, the ,New Existence of Man upon Earth, at this
period the only English paper devoted to the interests of
spiritualism. Owen's. view of the movement was that it
was the inauguration of a sort of millennium, a.
soda! revolution, for which he had looked throughout his
life.

Paigoels, The : The devils of Hindustan. Some of the Hindus
believe that the Paigoels were originally created devils ;
others that they were put out of heaven because of their
great sin, and of all worlds that the 'earth is the only one
with which they are allowed intercourse. Some of these
devils have individual names, and are the tempters of men
to special sins,-others again enter into the bodies of men
and take possession of them. The Hindus also believe
that the souls of wicked men go to join the number of·the
paigoels.
PaUngenesy : A term employed by the philosophers of the
seventeenth century to denote the" resurrection of plants,"
and the method of achieving their astral appearance after
destruction. In very e2rly times, we find philosophers
inclined to doubt if apparitions might not be accounted for
on natural principles, without supposing that a belief in
them was either referable to hallucinations, to human
imagination, or to impositions that might have been
practised. At length Lucretius attacked the popular
notion entertained of ghosts, by maintaining that they
were not spirits returned 1rom the mansions of the dead,
but nothing more than thin films, pellicles, or membranes,
cast off from the surface of all bodies like the exuvi<e or
sloughs of reptiles.
An opinion, by no means dissimilar to that of the Epicu-
reans, was revived in Europe about the middle of the 17th
century. It had its origin in Palingetlesy, or the resurrec-
tion of plants, a grand secret known to Digby, Kircher,
Schot, Gafferel, Vallemont, and others. These philosophers.
performed the operation of Palingenesy after the following-
manner :-They took.a plant, bruisea it, burnt it, collected.
its ashes, and, in the process of calcination, extracted from
it a salt. This salt they then put into a glass phial, and
mixed with it some peculiar substance, which these chemists
have not disclosed. When the compound was formed, it
was pulverulent, and possessed a blnish colour. The
powder was next submitted to a gentle heat, when its.
particles being instantly put into motion, there then,
gradually arose, as fwm the midst of the ashes, a stem,
leaves and flowers ; or, in other words, an apparition of the
plant which had been submitted to combustion. But as
soon as the heat was taken away, the form of the plant,
which bad been thus sublimed, 'vas precipitated to the-
bottom of the vessel. Heat was then re-applied, and the
vegetable phccnix was resusitated; it was withdrawn, and
the form once more became latent among the ashes. This-
notable experiment was said to have been performed before-
the Royal Society of England, and it satisfactorily proved
to this learned body, that the presence of heat gave a sort
of life to the vegetable apparition, and that the absence of
caloric caused its dea,th.
Cowley was quite delighted 'vith the experiment of the
rose and its ashes, and in conceiving that he bad Cletected
the same phenomenon in the letters written with the juicEt
Pallngenesy 313
of lemons. which were revived on the a,Pplication of heat,
he celebrated the mystic power of calonc after the follow-
ing manner :-
Strange power of heat, thoa yet dost show,
Like winter earth, uaked, or cloth'd with•snow
But as the quick'ning sun approaching near,
The plants arise up by degrees,
A sudden paint adorns the trees,
And all kind nature's characters appear.
So nothing yet in thee is seen,
But when a genial heat warms thee within,
A new-born wood of various lines there grows ;
Here buds an A, and there a B,
Here sprouts a V. and there a T,
And all the flourishing letters stand in rows.
The rationale of this famous experiment made on the
ashes of roses was attempted by Kircher. He supposed
that the seminal virtue of every known substance, and
even its substantial form, resided in its salt. This salt
was concealed in the ashes of the rose. Heat put it in
motion. The particl<'s of the salt were quickly sublimed,
and being moved about in the phial like a.vortex, at length
arranged themselves in the sa me general form they had
possessed from nature. It was evident, then, jrom the
result of this e""Jlerimcnt, that there was a tendency in
the particles of the salt to observe the same order of
position which they had in the living plant. Thus, for
instance, each saline corpuscle, which in its prior sbte
had held a place in the stern of the rose-slip, sym,Pathetically
fixed itself in a corresponding position when sublimed in
the chemist's vial. Other particles w.:rc subject to a
similar law, and accordingly, by a disposing affinity,
resumed their proper position, either in the stalk, the
leaves, or the flowers, and thus, at length, the entire
apparition of a plant was generated.
The next object of these philosophers was to a~;>ply their
doctrine to the explanation of the popular belief m ghosts.
As it was incontestably proved that the substantial form of
each body resided in a sott of volatile salt, it was perfectly
evident in what manner superstitious notions must have
arisen about ~hosts haunting churchyards. When a dead
body had been committed to the earth, the salts of it,
during· the heating process of fermentation, were exhaled.
The saline particles then each resumed the same relative
situation they bad held in the living body, and thus a
complete human form was induced, calculated to excite
superstitious fear in the minds of all but Palingenesists.
It is thus evident that Palingenesy was nothing more
Lucretius had made, "ith regard to the filmy substances
than a chemical explanation of the discovery which
that he had observed to arise from all bodies.
Yet, in order to prove that apparitions might be really
explained on this principle, the experimentum crucis was
still "1\'anting. But this deficiency was soon supplied.
Three alchemists had obtained a quantity of earth-mould
from St. Innocent's Church, in Paris, supposing that this
matter mi~ht contain the true philosopher's stone. They
subjected 1t to :>. distillatory process. On a sudden they
perceived in their vials forms of men produced. which
immediately caused them to desist from their labours.
This fact coming to the knowledge of the Institute of Paris.
under the protection of Louis XIV:, this learned body
took up the business with much seriousness, and the
result of their labours appears in the Misee//ania Curiosa.
Dr. Ferrier, in a volume of the Manchester Philosophical
Transactio11s, went to the trouble of making an abstract of
one of these French documents, which we prefer giving on
account of. its conciseness, rather than having recourse to
the original dis.~ertation.
Pallngenesy
" A malefactor was executed, of whose body a grave
physic1an got possession for the purpose of dissection.
After disposing of the other parts of the body, he ordered
his assistant to pulverize part of the cranium, which was a.
remedy at that time admitted in dispensatories. The
powder was left in a paper on the table of the museum.
where the assistant slept. About midnight be was awakened
by a noise in the room, which obliged him to rise immediately.
The noise continued about the table, without any visible
:>.g-ent; and at length he tr:tced it to the {lOwder, in the
midst of which he now beheld, to his unspeakable dismay,
a small head with open eyes staring at him; presently two
branches appeared, which formed into arms and hands ;
then the ribs became visible, which were soon clothed with
muscles and integuments ; next the lower extremities
sprouted out, and when they appeared perfect, the puppet
{for his size was small) reared himself on his feet; instantly
his clothes carne upon him, and he appeared in the very
cloak he wore at his execution. The affrighted spectator,
who stood hitherto mumbling his prayers with great appli-
cation, now thought of nothing but making his escape from
the revived ruffian : but this was impossible, for the
apparition planted himself in the way, -and, after divers·
fierce looks and threatening gestures, opened the door and
went out. No· doubt the powder was missing next
day."
But older analogous results are on record, indicating.
that the blood was the chief part of the human frame in
which those saline particles resided, the arrangements of
which gave rise to the popular notion of ghosts. Dr.
\Vebster, in his book on ·witchcraft, relates an experiment.
given on the authority of Dr. Flud, in which this very
satisfactoryconclusion was drawn.
·• A certain chymical operator, by name La Pierre, near
that place in Paris ca1led Le Temple, received blood from
the hands of a certain bishop to operate upon. Which be
setting to work upon the Saturday, did continue it for a
week with divers degrees of fire. But about midnight,
the Friday following, this artificer, lying in a chamber next
to his laboratory, betwixt sleeping and waking, heard a.
horrible noise, like unto the lowing of kine, or the roaring of
a lion : and continuing quiet, after the ceasing of the sound
in the laboratory, the moon being at the full, <>.nd, by shining
enlightening the chamber suddenly, betwixt himself and
the window he saw a thick little cloud, condensed into an
oval form, which, after, by little and little. did seem com-
pletely to put on the shape of a man, and making another
and a sharp clamour, did snddenly vanish. And not only
some noble persons in the next chambers, but also the
host with his wife, lying in a lower room of the house, and
also the neighbours dwelling in the opposite side of the
street, did distinctly hear as well the bellowing as the
voice ; and some of them were awaked with the vchcmency
thereof. But the artificer said, that in this he found solace.
because the bishop, of whom he had it, did admonish him,
that if any of them from whom the blood was extracted
should die, in the time of its putrefaction, his spirit was-
wont often to appear to the sight of the artificer, with per-
turbation. Also forthwith, upon Saturday following, he·
took the retort from the furnace, and broke it with the
light stroke of a little key, and there, in the remaining
blood, found the perfect representation of an human head~
agreeable in face, eyes, nostrils, mouth, and hairs, that
were some'l<"hat thin, and of a gol<!en colour."
Regarding this narrative Webster adds :-" There were
many ocular wil:nesses, as the noble person, Lord ot Bour-
dalone, the chief secretarv to the Duke of Guise ; and he
{Flud) had this relation from the Lcrd of Mcnanton, living
in that house at the same time, f.rom a C('rtain doctor of
physic, from the oVI-ncr of the house, and many others."
Palladino 314
Palladino, Eusapia : The most famous physical medium of
recent years, and one whose phenomena, investigated at
length by some of the most distinguished scientists of
Britain, France, and Italy, have led many to conclude that
they are genuine manifestations from the spirit world, or
that they illustrate the workings of some unknown force.
Eusapia was a Neapolitan peasant woman who from her
childhood had shov;n herself possessed of mediumistic-
powers. In 1892 a group of scientists-Professors Schia-
pareUi, Uroffcrio, Geroso, the well-known spiritualist
~[. Aksakoff, and others-held a series of sittings at :llilan,
with Eusapia as medium. Some of the s~ances were also
attended by Professors Richet and Lombroso. The
phenomena consisted of raps, materialisation of hands,
levitation of the table and other furniture within a radius
of three or four feet, and fluctuation of the medium's'
weight in the balance, to the extent of some 17lbs. It
was evident even then that Eusap1a would not lose an
opportunity of using fraud. .Nevertheless Professor Richet
was so impressed that in 1894 he organised a further series
of sittings with the same medium at his house on the lie
Rouband, and on this occasion were present Professor-
now Sir Oliver- Lodge, Mr. Myers, Dr. Ochorowicz, and
at a later stage, Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick. The seances
were held in darkness or semi-darkness, but the medium's
hands and feet were controlled by the investigators. Mrs.
Sidgwick, indeed, declared that Eusapia herself might easily
have produced the phenomena, if she had the usc of her
hands, but Professor Lodge and others were inclined to
attribute them to some external agency. In the following
year further s~ances were held at lllr. :Myer's house at
Cambridge, and when it became evident that Ettsap1a
frequently freed a foot or a hand Mr. ::vryers own faith in the
phenomena was temporarily-though only temporarily-
destroyed. Professor Richet and Sir Oliver Lodge, howe,•er,
retained their convictions unshaken. Dr. Hodgson, who
had already suggested that Et~sapia might usc some such
method, was also present at the Cambridge sittings.
Besides tb:>se already mentioned, many prominent Con-
tinental scientists investigated Eusapia's manifestations
among them being )L Camille Flammarion, Professor
Morselli, and M. and :\Ime. Curie. The two last mentioned
were members of a committeeof thelnstitutGe11iral Psycholc-
gi9ue of PaYis, which held an important series of sittings
w1th the medium in 1905, 1906, and 1907. In 1908 and
1909 again, the SocieLy for Psychical Research instituted a
fresh enquiry into Eusapia's methods. On the whole,
scientific opinion is still much divided as to the genuineness
cr otherwise of the phenomena. Some authorities, taking
into consideration the many times the Italian medium has
been caught cheating, and the absence of really conclusive
tests, incline to the belief tltat Eusapia is merely a clever
conjurer. Such were Dr. Hodgson, Mr. Podmore, Professor
and Mrs. Sidgwick. Others, again, such as Professors
Richet and Lombroso, M. Camille Flammarion and Sir
Oliver Lodge, arc of the opinion that the instances of fraud
arc mere incidents in the career of a trne medium, whose
performances plainly demonstrate the operation in the
material world of strange, unknown forces.
Palladium : (Sec Devil-worship.)
Palladium, Order of : A masonic-diabolic order, also entitled
the Sovereign-Council of Wisdom, founded in Paris on
May :zoth. 1737· It initiated women under the name of
companions of Penelope. The fact that it existed is
proved by the circumstance that Ragou, the Masonic
antiquary, published its ritual.
Palmistry : The science of divination by means of lines and
marks on the human hand. It is said to have been practised
in very early times by the Brahmins of India, and to be
known to Aristotle, who discovered a treatise on the subject
Palmistry
written in letters of gold, which be presented to Alexander
the Great, and which was afterwards translated into Latin
by Hispanus. There is also extant a work on the subject
by )felampus of Alexandria, and Hippocrates, Galen, and
several Arabian commentators have also dealt with it. In
the ;\fiddle Ages the science was represented by Hartlieb
(circa 1448), and Codes (circa 105-f), and Fludd, Indigane,
Rothmann, and many others wrote on cheiromancy. D'AI-
pentigny, Desbarolles, Carus, and others kept the science
aHvc in the earlier half of the nineteenth century, since
when a very large number of treatises upon it have been
written. Since J86o, or thereabouts, palmistry has-become
very much more popular than ever before in these islands,
and indeed is practised nearly all over the habitable globe.
Palmistry is sub-divided into three lesser arts--cheirog-
nomy, cbeirosophy and cheiromancy. The fm;t is the art
of recognising the type of intelligence from the form of the
bands; the second is the study of the comparative value of
manual formations; and the third is the art of divination
from the form of the hand and fingers, and the lines and
marldngs thereon. The palmist first of all studies the shape
and general formation of the hand as a whole, afterwards
regarding its parts and details,-the lines .and ~arkings
being considered later. From cheirognomyand chetrosophy
the general disposition and tendcnciE.'S are ascertained, and
future events are foretold from the reading of the lines and
markings.
There are several types of bands : the elementary or
large-palmed type; the necessary with spatulated fingers;
the artistic with conical-shaped fingers ; the useful, the
fingers of which arc square-shaped ; the knotted or phil-
osophical; the pointed, or p~ychic; a'?-d _the ~ixcd, in
which the types are blended. The pnnc•pal lines are :
those whlch separate the hand from the forearm at the
wrist, and which arc known as the rascettes, or the lines of
health, wealth and happiness. The line of life stretches
from the centre of the palm around the base of the thumb
almost to the wrist, and is ioined for a considerable part
of its course by the line of the head. The line of the heart
runs across two-thirds of the palm, above the bead line ;
and the line of fate bctw·een it and the line of the head.
nearly at right angles extend...g to·wards the wrist. The
line of fortune runs from the base of the third finger towards
the wrist parallel to the line of faLe. If the lines are deep,
firm and of narrow width the signrncanceis good--excepting
that a strong line of health shows constitution~! weakness.
At the base of the fingers, beginning with the first, lie
the mounts of Jupiter, Saturn, Apollo, and Mercury; at
the ba>e of the thumb the mount of Venus ; and opposite
to it, that of Luna. If well-proportioned they show cer-
tain virtues, but if exaggerated they indicate the vices
which correspond to these. The first displays religion,
reasonable ambition, or pride and superstition ; the second
wisdom and prudence, or ignorance and failure ; the third
when large makes for success and intelligence, when small
for meanne!ts or love o! obscurity; the fourth desire for
knowledge and industry, or disinterestedness and laziness.
The Lunar mount indicates sensitiveness, imagination,
morality or othen~ise; and self-will : and the mount of
Venus, charity and affection, or if exaggerated viciousness.
The phalanges of the fingers are also indicative of certain
faculties. For elCample, th~ first and second of the thumb,
according to their length, indicate the value of the logical
faculty and of the will ; those of the index finger in their
Jrder-materialism, law, and order; of the middle finger-
humanity, system, intelligence ; of the third finger-truth
economy, energy; and of the little finger goodnes~. pru-
dence, reflectiveness. There arc nearly a hundred other
marks and signs, by which certain qualities, influences or
events can be recognised. The line of life by its length
Papalol 315 Paraeelsus
indicates the len~tb of existence of its owner. If it is
short in both hands, the life will be a short one; if broken
in one hand and weak in the other. a serious illness is
denoted. If broken in both hands, it means death. If it is
much chained it means delicacy. lf it has a second or
sister line, it shows great vitality. A black spot on the
line shows illneJ;.~ at the time marked. A cross indicates
some L'ltality. The line of life coming out far into the
palm is a sign of long life. The line of the head, if long
and well-coloured, denotes intelligence and power. If
descending to the mount of the Moon it shows that the
head is much influenced by the imagination. Islands on
the line denote mental troubles. The head line forked
at the end indicates subtlety and a facility for seeing all
sides of the question. A double line of the head is an
indication of good fortune. The line of the heart should
branch towards the mount of Jupiter. If it should pass
<>ver the mount of Jupiter to the edge of the
hand and travel round the index finger, it is called " Solo-
mon's ring " and indicates ideality and romance; it is
also a sign of occult power. Points or dots in this line
may show illness if black, and if white love affairs; while
islands on the heart line indicate disease. The line of fate,
or Saturn, if it rises from the Lunar mount and ascends
towards the line of the heart is a sign of a rich marriage. If
it extends into the third phalange of Saturn's finger it
shows the sinister infl.uC!lce of that planet. A double line of
fate is ominous.
In such an article as this it would be out ot place to
mention the very numerous lesser lines and marks which
the band contains, especially when so many excellent books
<>f reference on rhe subject have recently been published.
It but remains to say that practitioners of the science of
paJmistn• are excceedingly numerous. Some of these work
on strictly scientific lines, while others pick it up in a merely
empirical way, and their forecasts of events to e<>me are
only so much " patter."

Paraeelsus : In the history of alchemy there is not a more
striking or picturesque figure than Aurcelus Philippus
Theophrastu:: Paracclsus Bombast von Hohenheim, the
illustrious physician and exponent of the hermetic philosc-
phy who has chosen to go down to fame under the name of
Para&elsus. He was born at Einsideln, near Zurich, in
the year 1493. His father, the natural son of a prince,
himself practise;l the " art of medicine," and was desirous
that his only son should follow the same profession. To
the fulfilment of th'lt desire was directed the early training
of Paracelsr~s-a training which fostered his imaginative
rather than his practical tcnaencics, and which first cast
his mind into the alchemical mould. It did not take him
long to discover that the medical traditions of the time
were but empty husks from which all substance had long
since dried away. " I considered with myself." he says,
" that if there were no teacher of medicine in the world, how
would I set about to learn the art ? No otherwise than in
the great open book of nature, written with the finger of
God." Having thus freed himself from the constraining
bonds of an outworn medical orthodoxy, whose chief
resources were bleeding, purging. and emetics, he set about
evolving a new system to replace the old, and in order that
he might study the book of nature to better advantage he
travelled exteno;ively from 1513 to 1524, visiting almost
every part of the known "'orld, studying metallurgy,
chemistry, and medicine, and consorting with vagabonds of
every description. He was brought before the Cham of
Tartary; conversed 'vith the m1.gicians of Egypt and Arabia,
and is said to ha:ve even reached India At length his
protract.ed wandenngs came to a close, and in 1524 he
settled m Basle, then a favourite resect of scholars and
physicians, where he was appointed to fill the chair of
medicine at the University. Never bad Basle witnessed a
~ore brilli:"nt, er~tic professor. His inflated language,
his e_ccentnc behaVIour, the splendour of bis conceptions
flashing through a fog of obscurity, at once attracted and
repelled, and gained for him friends and enemies. His
:>ntip"'thy to the Galenic school became ever more pro-
nounced, and the crisis came when he publicly burned the
works of Galen and Avicenna in a brazen vase into which
~e bad cast nitre and s~1lphur. By such a proceeding he
mcurred the hatred of h1s more conservative brethren and
cut himself off for ever from the established scho~l of
medicine. He continued his triumphant career, ho"ever,
till a conflict with the m$\gistrates brought it to an abrupt
close. He was forced ~o flee from Basic, and thereafter
wandered from place to place, gaining a Jiving as best
he might. An element of mystery surrounds the man11er
of his death, which took place in 1541, but the best
authenticated account states that he was poisoned at the
instigation of the medical faculty.
But interesting as were the events of his life, it is to his
work that most attention is due. Not only was he the
founder of the modern science ·Of medicine ; the magnetic
theory of Mesmer, the " astral " theory of modern spit:itu<~.l­
ists, the philosophy of Descartes, were all foreshadowed in
the fantastic, yet not always illogical, teaching of Paracel·
sus. He revived the " miervcosmic " theory of ancient
Greece, and sought to prove the human body analogous
to the Solar System, by establishing a connection between
the seven organs of the body and the seven planets. He
preached the doctrines of the efficacy of will-power and the
imagination in such words as these : " It is possible that
my spirit, without the help of my body, and through an
ardent will alone, and without a sword, can stab and
wound others. It is also possible that I can bring the
spirit of my adversary into an image and then fold him up
or lame him at my pleasure." " Resolute imagination is
the beginning of all magical operations." " Because men
do not perfectly believe and 1magine, the result is, that
arts are uncertain whtn they might be wholly certain."
The first principle of his doctrine is the extraction of the
quintessence, or philosophic mercury, from every material
body. He believed that if the quintessence were draw·n
from each animal, plant, and mineral, -the combined result
would equal the universal spirit, or " astral body" in
man, and that a draught of the extract would renew his
youth. He came at length to the conclusion that " astral
bodies " exercised a mutual influence on each other, and
declared that he himself had communicated with the dead,
and with living persons at a considerable distancce. He
was tl~e first to connect this influence with that of the
magnet, and to usc the word " magnetism " with its
present application. It was on this foundation that
Mesmer built his theory of magnetic influence. V\Th.ile
Paracslsus busied himself with such problems, however, he
did not neglect the study and practice of medicine. Indeed,
astrology and the magnet entered largely into his treatment.
When he was sought by a patient, his first care was to
consult the planets, whece the disease had its origin, and
if the patient were a woman he took it for granted that the
cause of her malady lay in the moon. His anticipation of
the philoS<>phy of Descartes, consisted in his theory that by
bringing the various elements of the human body into
harmony with the elements of nature--fire, light, earth,
etc.-old age and death might be indefinitely postponed.
His experiment in the extraction of its essential spirit from
the poppy resulted in the production of laudanum, which be
Paraeelsus 316
prescribed freely in the form of •1 three black pills." The
recipes which be gives for the Philosopher's Stone, the
Elixir of Life, and various universal remedies, are exceed-
ingly obscure. He is deservedly celebrated as the first
physici. n to use opium and mercury, and to recogJJi~e the
value of sulphur. He applied himself.also to the solution
of a problem which still exercises the minds of scientific
men-whether it is possible to produce life from inorganic
matter. PaYacelsus asserted that it was, and has, left on
record a quaint recipe for a homrmculus, or artificial man.
By a peculiar treatment of certain "spagyric substances"
-which he has unfortunately omitted to specify-he
declared that he could produce a perfect human child in,
miniature. Speculations such as these, medical, alchemical
and philosophical, were SC'\ttered so profusely throughout
his teaching that we arc compelled to admit that here was a
master-mind, a genius, who was a charlatan only incidently,
by reason of training and temperament. Let it be remem-
bered that he lived in an age when practically all scholars
and physicians were wont to impose on popular ignorance,
and we cannot but remark that Paracelsus displayed, under
all his arrogant exterior, a curious singleness of purpose,
and a real desire to penetrate the mysteries of science. He
has left on record the principal points of the philosophy on
which he founded his researches in his "Archidoxa. Medi-
ci11a." It contains the leading rules of the art of healing,
as he practised and preached them. " I had resolved,"
he says, " to give ten books to the ' AYchidoxa,' but I have
reservE'.d the tenth in my head. It is a treasure which men
are not worthy to possess, and shall only be given to the
world when they shall have abjured Aristotle, Avicenna,
and Galen, and promised a perfectsubmission to Payacelsus."
The world did not recant, but Paraulsu$ relented, and at
the entreaty of his disciples published 'this t~nth book, the
key to the nine others, but a key which might pass for a
Jock, and for a lock which we cannot even pick. It is
entitled the " Tenth Book of the Arch-Doctrines: or, On
tile SecYel Mysteries of Natuye," A brief summary of it is
as follows :-
He begins by supposing and ends by establishing that
there is a universal spirit infused into the veins of man,
forming within us a species of invisible body, of which our
visible body, which it directs and governs at its will, is but
the wrappmg-the casket. This universal spirit is not
simple--not more simple, for instance, than the number
roo, which is a collection of units. 'Vhere, then, are the
spiritual units of which our complex spirit is composed ?
Scattered in plants and minerals. but principally in metals.
There exists in these inferior productions of the earth a
host of sub-spirits which sum themselves up in us, as the
universe does in God. So the science of the philosopher
has simply to unite them to the body-to disengage them
from the grosser matter which clogs and confines them,
to separate 1:_he pure from the imJ>ure. .
To separate the pure from the tmpure is, m other words,
to seize upon the soul of the heterogeneous bodies-to
evolve their" predestined element," "the seminal essence
of beings,'' "the first being, or quintessence."
To understand this latter word "quintessence," it is
needful for the reader to know that every body, whatever
it may be, is composed of four elements, and that the
essence compounded of th($e clements forms a fifth, which
is the soul of the mixed bodies, or, in other words, its
'' mercury," " I have shown,'' says Paraulsus, " in my
book of' Elements,' that the quintessence is the same thing
as mercury. There is in mercury whatever wise men
seek." That is, not the mercury of modem chemists, but
a philosophical me.rcury of which t>very body has its own.
" There are as many mercuries as there are things. The
mercury uf a vegetable, a mineral, or an animal of the
Paracelsus
same kind, although strongly resembling each other, does
not precisely resemble another mercury, and it is for this
reason that vegetables, minerals, and animals of the same
species arc not exactly alike. . . . The true mercury of
philosophers is the radical humidity of each body, and its
veritable semen, or essence."
Paracelsus now sought for a plant worthy of holding in
the vegetable kingdom the same rank as gold in the metallic
-a plant whose .. predestined element " should unite in
itself the virtues of nearly all the vegetable essences.
Although this was not easy to distinguish, he recognised at
a glance--we know not by what signs-the supremacy of
excellence in the melissa, and first decreed to it that phar-
maceutical crown which at a later period the Carmelites
ought to have consecrated. How he obtained this new
specific may be seen in the Life of Panz.celst<s, by
Savarien :
" He took some balm-mint in flower, which be bad taken
care to collect before the rising of the sun. He pounded it
in a mortar, reduced it to an impalpable dust, poured it
into a long-necked vial which he sealed hermetically, and
placed it to digest (or settle) for forty hours in a heap of
horse-dung. This time expired, he opened the vial, and
found there a matter which be reduced into a fluid by
pressing it, separating it from its impurities by exposure to
the slow heat of a baitl·marie. The grosser parts sunk to the
bottom, and he drew off the liqueur which floated on the
top, filtering it through some cotton. ThiS liqueur having
been poured into a bottle he added to it the fixed salt, which
he had drawn from the same plant when dried. There
remained nothing more but to extract from this liqueur the
first lief or being of the plant. For this purpose Paracelsus
mixed the liqueur with so much • water ofsalt' (understand
by this the mercurial element or radical humidity of the
salt), put it in a matrass, exposed it for six weeks to the sun,
and finally, at the expiration of this term, discovered a last
residuum which was decidedly, according to him, the first
life or supreme essence of the plant. But at all events, it
is certain that what he found in his matrass was the genie or
spirit he required: and with the surplus, if there we•e any,
we need not concern ourselves."
Those who may wish to know what this genie was like, are
informed that it as exactly resembled, as two drops of
water, the spirit of aromatic wine known to-day as absintite
suisse. It was a liquid green as emerald,-green, the bright
colour of hope and spring-time. Unfortunately, it failed as
a specific in the conditions indispensable for an elixir of
immortality : but it was a preparation more than bal£-
eelestial, which almost rendered old age impossible.
By means and manipulations as subtle and ingenious
as those"which be employed upon the melissa, Paracelsus
did not draw, but learned to extract, the "predestined
element " of plants which ranked much higher in the
vegetable aristocracy,-the " ftrst life" of the gilly-
fiower, the cinnamon, the myrrh, the scammony, the
celandine. All these supreme essences, which, according
to the 5th book of "Archidoxa,'' unite with a mass of
" magisteries " as precious as they are rude, are the base
oi so many specifics, equally reparative and regenerative.
This depends upon the relationship which exists between
the temperament of·a privileged plant and the temperament
of the inrlividual who asks of it his. rejuvenescence.
However brilliant were the results of his discoveries, those
he obtained or those he tcought he might obtain, they
'~ere for PaYacelsus but the a b c of Magic. To the eyes of
so consummate an alchemist, vogetable life is nothing; it
is the mineral-the metallic liic-whicil is all. So \\C may
assure ours;elves that it was in his power to seize the first
life-principle of the moon, the sun, l\lars, or Saturn; that
is, of silver, gold, iron, or lead. It v.-as equally facile for
Paraeelsus 317
him to grasp the life of the precious stones, the bitumens. the
sulphurs, and even that of animals.
Paracelsus sets forth several methods of obtaining this
great arcanum. Here is the shortest and most simple as
recorded by I neola Francus :-
"Take some mercury, or at least the element of mercury,
separating the pure from the impure, and afterwards
pounding it to perfect whiteness. Then you shall sublimate
it with sal-ammoniac, and this so many times as may be
ne~essary to resolve it into a ftuid. Calcine it, coagulate
it, and again dissolve it, and let it strain in a pelican during
a philosophic month, until it thickens and assumes the
form of a hard substance. Thereafter this torm of stone
is incombustible, and nothing can change or alter it;
the metallic bodies which it penetrates become fixed and
incombustible, for this material is incombustible, and
change!> the imperfect metals into metal perfect. Although
I have given the process in few words, the thing itself
demands a long toil, and many difficult cixcumstances,
which I have expressly omitted, not to weary the reader,
who ought to be very diligent and intelligent if he wishes
to arrive at the ac<'.omplishment of this great work."
Paracelsu,< himsel£ tells us in his " Archidoxa," when
explaining his own recipe for the completion of it, and
-profiting by the occasion to criticise his fello,v-,~orkers.
" I omit," he writes, "what I have said in different
places on the theory of the stont> ; I will say only that
this arcanum does not consist in the blast (rouille) or
flowers of antimony. It must be sought in the mercury
of antimony, which, when it is carried to perfection, is
nothing else than the heaven of metals ; for even as the
heaven gives life to plants and minerals, so does the pure
quintessence of antimony vitrify everything. Thls is why
the Deluge was not able to deprive any substance of its
virtue or properties, for the heaven being the life of all
beings, there IS nothing superior to it which can modify or
destroy it.
" Take the antimony, purge it of its atserucal impurities
in an iron vessel until the coagulated mercury of the
antimony appears quite white, and is distinguishable by
the star which appears in the superficies of the regulus, or
semi-metal. But although this regulus, which is the
element of mercury, has in itself a veritable hidden life,
nevertheless th~e things are in virtue, and not :>.ctually.
" Therefore, if you wish to reduce the power to action,
you must disengage the life which is concealed in it by a
livingfire like to itself, or with a metallic vinegar. To discover
thio; fire many philosophers have proceeded differently, but
agreeing to the foundations of the art, have arrived at the
desired end. For some with great labour have drawn forth
the quintessence of the thickened mercury of the regulus of
antimony, and by this means have reduced to action the
mercury of the antimony : others have considered that
there was a uniform quintessence in the other minerals, as
for example in the fn..ed sulphur of the vitriol. or the stone
of the magnet, and having extracted the quintessence, have
afterwards matured and exalted their hea.ven with it, and
reduced it to action. Their process is good, and has had its
result. Meanwhile this fire-this corporeal life-which
they seek with toil. i~ found much more easily and in much
greater perfection in the ordinary mercury, which appears
through its perpetual fluidity-a. proof that it possesses a
very powerful fire and a celestial life similar to that which
lies hidden in the regulus of the antimony. Therefore. he
who would wish to exalt our metallic heaven, starred, to its
greatest completeness, and to reduce into action its potential
virtues, he must first extract from ordinary mercury its
corporeal life, which is a celestial fire ; that is to say the
quintessence of quicksilver, or, in other words, the metallic
viut"gar, that has resulted from its dissolution in the water
Paracelsus
which originally producca it, and which is its own mother;
that is to say, he must dissolve it in the arcanum of the
salt I have described, and mingle it with the' stomach of
Anthion,' wh1ch is the spiritofvinegar, and in this menstruum
melt and filter and consistent mercury of the antimony,
strain it in the said liquor, and finally reduce it into crystals
ofa yellowish green, ofwhich we havespoken inour manual."
As regards the Philosopher's Stone, he gives the following
formula:-
" Take," said he, " the electric mineral not yet mature
- (antimony), put it in its sphere, in the fire with the iron,
to remove its ordures and other superfluities, and purge it
as much as you can, following the rules of chymistry, so
that it may not suffer by the aforesaid impurities. Make,
in a word, the regulus with the mark. This done, cause it
to dissolve in the ' stomach of the ostrich ' (vitriol), which
springs from the e-arth and is fortincd in its virtue by the
' sharpness of the eagle ' (the metallic vinegar or essence of
mercury). As soon a.o; the essence is perfected. and when
after its dissolution it has taken the colour of the herb
called calendule, do not forget to reduce it into a spiritual
luminous essence, which resembles amber. After thls,
add to it of the ' spread eagle ' one half the weight of the
election before its preparation, and frequently distil the
' stomach of the ostrich ' into the matter, and thus the
election will become much more spiritualized. '\'\Then the
' stomach of the ostrich ' is weakened by the labour of
di~estlon, we must strengthen it and frequently distil it.
Finally, when it has lost all its Impurity, add as much
tartarized quintessence as will rest upon your fingers, until
it throws off its impurity and rises w1th tt. Repeat this
procE>ss until the preparation becomes white, and this will
suffice; for you shall se~ yourself as l!'radually it rises in
the form of the' cx:~.lted eagle.' and with little troublt" con-
verts itself in its form (like sublimated mercury) ; and
that is what we arc seeking.
" I tell you in truth that there is no greater remedy in
medicine than that which lies in this eloction, and that
there is nothing like it in the whole world. But not to
digress from my purpose, and not to leave thls work
imperfect, observe the manner in which you ought to
operate."
" The electic,n then being destroyed, as I have s<~id, to
arrive at the desired end (which is, to make of it a universal
medicine fo1 human as well as metallic bodies), take your
election, rendered light and volatile by the method above
~scribed. ·
" Take of it as much as vou would wish to reduce it to
its perfection, and put it in aphilosophical egg of glass, and
seal it very tightly, that nothing of it may respire; put
it into an athanor until of itself,it resolves into a liquid, in
such a manner that in the middle of this sea there may
appear a small island, which daily diminishes, and finally,
all shall be changed to a colour black a.s ink. This colour
is the raven, or bird which flies at night without win!!s. and
which, through the celestial dew, that rising continually
falls back by a constant circulation, changes into what is
called 'the head of the raven,' and afterwards resolves
into ' the tail of the peacock,' then it assumes the hue of
the ' tail of a peacock.' and afterwards the colour of the
' feathers of a swan '; finally acquiring an extreme redness,
which marks its fiery nature, and in virtue of which it
expels all kinds of impurities, and strengthens feeble
members. This preparation, according to ;>.ll philosophers,
is made in a single vessel, over a sin!(le furnace, with an
equal and continual fire, and this medicine, which is more
than celestial, cures all kinds of infirmities, a~ well in
human as metallic bodies; wherefore no one can under-
stand or attain such an arcanum without the help of GOO :
for its virtue is ineffable and divine."
Paradise 318
Paradise : From old Pers1an (Zeud) patredaiza an enclosure, a
walled-in place; Old Persian pairi, around, dig, to mould,
form, shape (hence to form a wall of e.1.rth).
Parad~e has been sought'for or located in many regions
of the earth. In Tartary, Armenia, Tndia, and China: on
the banks of the Euphrates and of the Ganges; in ~I~­
potamia., Syria., Persia, Arabia, Palestine, and Ethiop1a,
and ncar the mountains of Libanus and Anti-libanus.
Perhaps the most noteworthy tradition is that which fixes
its situation in the Island of Ceylon, the Serendib of the
ancient Persians, at:d the Taprobane of the Greek geogra-
phers. '· It is from the summit of Hamalleel or Adam's
Peak," says Percival in his history of Ceylon, " tllat Adam
took his last view of PaYadise before he quitted it never to
return. The spot on which his !eet stood at the moment !S
still supposed to be found in an impression on the summ1t
of the mountain, resembling the print of a man's foot, but
more than double the ordinary size. After taking this
farewell view, the father of mankind is said to have gone
over to the continent of Judea, which was at that time
joined to the island, but no sooner had he passed Adam's
Bridge than the sea closed behind him, and cut off all. hopes
of return. This tradition, from whatever source 1t was
deri:ved, seems to be interwoven with the earliest notions of
religion entertained by the Cingalese; and it is difficult
to conceive that it could have been engrafted on them
without forming an original part. I have frequcnlly had
the curiosity to converse with black men of different castes
concerning this tradition of Adam. All of them, with
every appearance of belief, assured me that it was really
true, and in support of it produced a variety of testimonies,
old sayings, and prophecies, which have for ages been
current among them. The origin of these traditions I do
not pretend to trace; but their connection with Scripture
history is very evident, and they afford a new instance
bow universally the opinions with respect to the origin of
man coincide." \Ve a~e further informed by tltis writer
that a large chair fixed in a rock near the summit of the
mountain i~ said lo be the workmanship of Adam. ·' It
has the appearance of having been placed there at a very
distant period. but who really placed it there, or for what
purpose, it is impossible for any European to discover."
Paradise is a word of Persian origin, adopted by the
Greeks, and literally denotes an inclosure or park planted
with fruit-trees, and abounding with various animals.
Eden is not termed Paradise in Genesis. but simply a garden
planted eastwards in the country or district so called ; and
it is this apparently indefinite locality which has caused
so many conjectures as to its exact site. Some place it in
Judea. where is now lhe sea o! Galilee: others in Armenia,
near Mount Ararat ; and others in Syria, towards the
sources of the Orontes, the Chrysorrhoas, and Barrady.
Some think that by Eden is meant the whole earth, which
was of surprising beauty and fertility before the Fall ; and
it is curious that a notion prevailed to a great extent among
the various nations, that the Old \Vorld was under a
curse, and that the earth became very barren. 'vVe are
also assured that the Hindoos and Chinese believe that
all nature is contaminated, and that the earth labours
undre some dreadful defilement-a sentiment which could
only result from obscure traditions connected with the
first human pair. josephus gravely says that the Sacred
Garden was watered by one river which ran round the
whole earth, and was divided into four parts; but he
appears to think Paradise was merely a figurative or
alleg...,rical locality. Some of the natives of Hindostan
have traditions of a place resembling Paradise on the
banks of the Ganges ; but their accounts are so completely
blended with their superstitions, and with their legends
respecting the Deluge and the second peopling of the
Paradise
world, as to be, to a certam extent, unintelligtble. A
writer who had d1ligently studied the Indian Puro.nas for
many years, opened a new source cf information, and placed
Eden on the lmaus Mountain~ of India. •· It appears from
Scripture," he says, " that Adam and Eve Ji,·ed in the
countries to the eastward of Eden; for ~t the eastern
entrance of it God placed the ang<'l with thdlamingsword.
This is also confirmed by the Puranics, who place the
progenitor of mankind on the mountainous regions between
Cabul and the Ganges, on the banks of which, in the hiiJs,
they show a place '1\'here he resorted occasionally for
religious purposes. It is frequented by pilgrims. At the
entrance of the passes leading to the place where I suppose
was the Garden of Eden, and to the eastward of it, the
Hindoos have placed a destroying angel, who appears,
and it is generally represented like a cherub; I mean
Garudha, or the Eagle, upon whom Vishnu and Jupiter
are represented riding. Garudha is represented generally
like an eagle, but in his compound character somewhat
like the cherub. He is represented like a young man, with
the countenance, wings, and talons of the eagle. In
Scripture the Deity is represented riding upon a cherub,
and B.ying upon the wings of the wind. Garudha is called
Vahan (literally the Vehicle) of Vishnu or jupiter, and he
thus answers to the cherub of Scripture; for many com-
mentators derive this word from the obsolete root c'harab,
in the Cbaldean language, a word implicitly synonymous
with the Sanscrit Vahan." We· may here add, that the
Puranics considered the north-wesl part of India, about
Cashmere, as the site of Paradise, and the original abode of
the first human pair; and lhat lbere, at the offering of a
sacrifice Daksha was mllrdered by l1is jealous brother, who
wasin consequencedoomed to becomea fugitive on the earth.
In the fabled Meru of the Hindoo mythology, on the
other hand, we have i!.ISO a descriptive representation of
the ~Iosaical Garden of Eden. J\Ieru is a conical mountain,
the exact locality of which is not fixed ; but as
the Hindoo geographers considered the earth as a flat
table, and the sacred mountain of 1\leru rising in the middle.
it became at length their dectded conviction that ~lcru was
the North Pole, from their notion that the North Pole was
the highest part of the world. So firmly we are told, was
this tradition believed, that although some Hindoo writers
admitted that Mount l\leru must be situated in the central
part of Asia, yet rather than relinquish their notion of and
predilection for the Xorth Pole as the real locality of their
Paradise, they actt~ally forced the sun out of the ecliptic,
and placed the Pole on the elevated plains of the Lesser
Bokhara. If we, however, examine the Hindoo description
of this Paradise, we shall at once be able to trace
its origin a11d its close analogy to the Mosaic account.
The summit of ~reru is considered as a circular plain of
vast extent, surrounded by a belt of hills-a celestial
earth, the abode of immortals, and is designated Ida-
Vratta, or the Circle of Ida. It is of four different colours
towards the cardinal points, and is believed to be supported
by four enormous buttresses of gold, silver, copper and
iron. Yet doubts exist as to its r<'.al appearance, some
alleging that its form is that of a square pyramid, others
maintain that its shape is conical ; others that it resembles
an inverted cone ; while others thought, that instead
of a circular belt of mountains, l\leru terminated in
three lofty peaks. The Sawas assert that a vast river
rises from the head of their deity Siva, and the Vaisl:natras
that it springs from beneath the feet of Vishnu, and, after
passing through the circle of the moon, falls upon the
summit of ::'vferu, and divides itself into four streams,
flowing towards the four cardinal points. Others believe
that the four rivers of the sacred mountain spring from
the roots of Jambri, a tree of immer!Se size which, they say,
Paradise 319
conveys the most extensh·e and profound knowledge, and
accomplish'es the most desirable of human aspirations. The
reader will recoll~ct the t.Io~aical account of the Tree of
Knowledge, which stood in the middle of the Garden, and
of the river which wPnt out of Eden to water it, dividing
itself int6 four branches or streams of oth<'r rivers.
The river thus rising in 'lcru. the Hindoos further say,
flows in four opposite directions to the four cardinal points
and is supposed to is!>ue from four rocks, carved in the
shape of so many different animals. one of which is a cow;
and this, they allege, is the origin of the Ganges. Some
among them, however, think that this river first flows
round t!le ~acred city of Brahma, and then discharges itself
into a lake called Mansarovara, from which it issues through
the rocky heads of four animals to the different divisions
of the globe. The cow's head, from which issues the
Ganges, they place towards the south ; and towads the
north is the tiger, or lion's head. The horse'.s head is on
the west, and on th«" east is that of the elephant.
The traditions of Cashmere represent that country as the
original site of Parndisc. and the abode of the first human
pair ; and the Buddhists of Thibet hold opinion respecting
the mountain Mcru similar to those of the Hindoos. They
locate the sacred Garden, however, at the foot of the moun-
tain, ncar the source of the Ganges ; but the four holy
rivers arc made to issue through the heads of the same
animals, which arc believed to be the guardians of the
divisions of the world. The tree of knowledge, or of life,
they designate Zambri, which, they say, is a celestial tree,
bearing immort<>.l fn1it, and flourishes near four vast rocks,
from which issue the several rivers which water the world.
The Mussulmans inhabiting the adjacent countries have
adopted the popular belief that PaMdise was situated in
Cashmere, adding that when the first man was driven
from it, he and his wife wandered separately for some time.
They met at a place called lhhlaka, or Balk, so called
because they they mutually embraced each other after a
long absence. Two gigantic statues, which they say, are
yet to be seen between Bahlaka and Bamiyan, represent
Adam and Eve, and a third of smaller dimensions is that
of their son Scish or Seth, whose tomb, or its site, is pointed
out near Bahlaka.
Some of the writers seriously maintained that Paradise
was under the Xorth Pole, arguing upon an idea of the
anci.,nt Babylonians and Egyptians, that the ecliptic or
solar way was Otigina!ly at right angles to the Equator, and
so passed directly over the North Pole. The opinion
generally entertained by the Mahomedans that it was in
one of the seven heavens, is not more ridiculous than. the
preceding supposition. Dr. Clarke sums up the extrava-
gant theories respecting the locality of Paradise. " Some
place it as follows :-In the third heaven, others in the
fourth, some within the orbit of the moon, others in the
moon itself, some in the middle regions of the air, or beyond
the earth's attraction, some on the earth, others under the
earth, and others within the earth."
Before le'3.ving the East, it may be observed that the
Orientals generally reckon four sites of Paradise in Asia :
the first Ceylon, already mentioned ; the second in Chaldea ;
the third in a district of Persia, watered by a river called
the Nilab ; and the fourth about Damascus in Syria, ar..d
near the springs of the jordan. This last supposed site
is not peculiar to the Oriental writers, as we find it main-
tained by some Europeans. especially Heidegger, Le Clerc,
and Hardouin. The following are the traditions believed
by the inhabitants of the city of Damascus-a city which
the Emperor Julian the Apostate styled the Eye of all the
East, the most sacred and most magnificent Damascus.
" I understand," says Lamartine," that Arabian tra-
ditions represent this city and its neighbourhood to form
Paradise
the sile of the lost PaYadiu, and certainly I should think
that no place upon earth was better calculated to answer
one's ideas of Eden. Thr vast and fruitful plain, v.;th the
seven branches of the blue stream which irrigate it-the
maje~tic fram<'worl: of thr mountains-the glittering lakes
which reflect the heaven upon the earth-its geographical
situation between the two sras-thc perfection of the
climate-e,·cry thinr, indicntcs thnt Dnmascus has at lea.c;t
been one of the fir!'t towns that were built by the children
of men-one of the nMural halts of fugitive humanity in
pdmcval times. It is, in fact, one of those sites pointed
out by the hand of God for a city-a site predestined to
sustain a capital like Constl\ntinoplc." Accotding to the
Orientals, Damascus stands on the site of the Sacred
Garden, and without the city is th~.: most beautiful mc?.dow
divided by the river Barrady, of the red earth of which
Adam is all<.'ged to have been formed. This field is designa-
ted Ager Damascenus by the Latins, and nearly in the
centre of it a pillar formerly stood, intended to mark the
precise spot where the Creator breathed into the first man
the breath of !if<'.
The numerous traditions which existed amon~ ancient
nations of the Garden of Eden doubtless originated those
curious and magnificent gardens designed and planted by
the Eastern princes, such as the Golden Garden of Aristo-
bulus, King of the J<!WS, which was consecrated by Pompey
to Jupiter Capitolinus. Nor is mythology deficient in
similar legends. Vl/c have the Gardens of Jupiter, of
Alcinous, and of the Fortunate 'Jslands, but especially of
the Hesperides, in which not only the primeval Pal'adise,
but traditions of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil,
and of the original promise made to the woman, are prom-
inently conspicuous. The Garden of the Hesperides pro-
duced golden fruit, guarded by a dangerous serpent- that
this fierce reptile encircled with its folds a mysterious tree--
and that Hercules procured the fruit by encountering and
killing the serpent. The story of the constellation, as
related by Eratosthenes, is applicable to the Garden of
Eden, and the primeval history of mankind. " This
serpent," says that ancient writer, alluding to the con-
stellation, " is the same as that which guarded the golden
apples, and was slain by Hercules. For, when the gods
offered presents to Juno on her nuptial~ with Jupiter, the
Earth also brought golden apples. Juno, admiring their
beauty, commanded them to be planted in the garden of
the gods ; but finding that they were continually plucked
by the daughter of Atlas, she appointed a vast serpent to
guard them. Hercules overcame and slew the monster.
Hence, in this constellation the serpent is depicted rearing
its head aloft, while Hercules, placed above it with one
knee bent, tramples with his foot upon its head. and
brandishes a club in his right hand." The Greeks placed
the Garden of the Hcspcrides close to Mount Atlas, and
then removed it far into the regions of vVestern Africa;
yet all knowledge of its Asiatic site wa:; not erased from the
classical mythologists, for Apollodorus tells us th«l certain
writers situated it not in the Libyan Atlas. but in the
Atlas of the Hypcrboreans; and he adds. that the serpent
had the faculty of uttering articulate sounds.
Our Teutonic ancestors believed that the world was
originally a Paradise, and its first inhabitants more than
human, whose dwelling was a magnificent hall, glittering
with fine gold, where love, and joy, and friendship presided.
The most insignificant of their utensils were made of gold.
and hence the appellation of the Golden age. But this
happiness was soon overthrown by certain women from the
country of the giants, to whose seductions the first mortals
yielded, and their innocence and integrity were lost for
ever. The trans~ession of f::ve is the obvious prototype
of the fatal curiosity of Pandora ; and the arrival of women
Paradise 320 Pasqually
from the country of the giants, and their tntercourse with
a distinct and purer line of mortals, can scarcely fail of
bringing forcibly to our recollection the marriages of the
sons of Seth with the daughters of Cain, with werP. the
principal causes of the universal depravity of the Ante-
diluvians.
The legends of Hindostan also supply us with accounts of
the happiness of Paradise in the Golden Age of the classic
mythology. "TI1erc can arise little doubt," says )1aurice,
"that by the Satya age, or Age of Perfer.tion, the Brahmins
~bviously allude to the state of perfection and happiness
.enjoyed by man in Paradise. It is impossible to explain
what the Indian writers assert concerning the universal
purity of manners, and the lmcurious and unbounded
plenty prevailing in that primitive era, without this sup-
position. Justice, truth, philanthrophy. were then prac-
tised among all the orders and classes of manl..-ind. There
was then no extortion, no circumvention. no fraud, used
in the dealings one with another. Perpetual oblations
smoked on the altars of the Deity ; every tongue uttered
praises, and every heart glowed with gratitude to the
Supreme Creator. The gods, in token of their approbation
of the conduct of mortals, condescended frequently to
become incarnate, and to hold personal intercourse with
the yet undepraved race, to instruct them in arts and
sciences; to unveil their own sublime functions and pure
nature ; and to make them acquainted with the economy
of those celestial regions into which they were to be imme-
diately translated, when the period of their terrestial
probation expired."
Parama-Hamsas : (See India.)
Paraskeva, Saint : A saint of the Russian Calendar, whose
feast day is August 3rd. On that day pilgrims from all
parts of Russia congregate in St. Petersburg for the purpose
of casting out d evils. A newspaper report of the pio-
ceedings as they occurred in 1913 is as follows:-
"Another St. Parasheva's day has r.ome and gone. The
usual fanatical scenes have been enacted in the suburbs of
St. Petersburg, and the ecclesiastical authorities have not
protested, nor have the police intervened. Special trains
have again been run to enable thousands of the lower
classes to witness a spectacle, the toleration of which will
only be appreciated by those acqt:ainted ~\itb the writings
of l\1. Pobiedonostzeff, the late Procurator of the Holy
Synod. The Church of St. Parask~va is situated in a
factory d istrict of the city. On the exterior side of one of
the walls is an ima~e of the Saint, to whom is attributed
the power o£ driving out devils and curing epileptics,
neurotics, and others by miraculous intervention. At
the same time, the day is made a popular holiday, with
games and amusements of all sorts, booths and lotter;es,
refre~hment stalls and drinking bars. The newspapers
publish detailed accounts of this year's proceedings without
comment, and it is perhaps signi.licant that the Novoe
Vremya, a pillar of orthodoxy, ignores them altogether.
Nor is this surprising when one reads of women clad in a
single undergarment with bare arms being hoisted up by
stalwart peasants to the level of the image in order to kiss
it, and then having impure water and unclarified oil forced
down their throats. The treatment of the first sick woman
is typical of the rest. One young peasant lifted her in lhe
air, two others held her arm:; fully extended, while a fourth
seized her loosened hair. and, dragging her head from side
to side and up and do\vn, shouted " Kiss, kiss St. Paras-
neva I " The woman's garment was soon in tatters. She
began groaning. Qne of the men eJCclaimed : " Get out !
Satan! Say · where thou art lodged!" The woman's
head was pulled back by the.bair, her mouth was fotS:ed
open, and mud-coloured water (said to be holy water) was
poured into it. She spat the water out, and was beard to
moan. " Oh, they are drowning me I " The young man
exultantly exclaimed, " So we've got you, devil, have we?
Leave her at once or we will drown you I" He continued
pouring water into the victim's mouth, and after that
unclarified oil. Her lips were held closed, so that she was
obliged to swallow it. The unfortunate woman was again
raised and her face pressed against the image. " Kiss it I
ltiss it l " she was commanded, and she obeyed. She was
asked who was the cause of her being " possessed."
" Anna," was the whispered reply. \Vbo was Anna ?
'What was her viUage ? In which cottage did she live ?
A regular inquisition. The physical and mental sufferings
of the first victim lasted about an hour, at the end of which
she was handed over to her relatives, after a cross had been
given to her, as it was found that she did not own one.
According to accpunts published by the Retch, Molva, etc.,
many other women were treated in the same Cashion, the
exercises lasting a whole day and night. The men " pil-
grims .. would seem to have been less severely handled.
It is explained that the idea of unclothing the woman is
that there should be no knot, bow, or fastening where the
devil and his coadjutors could find a lodgment. And one
is left with the picture of scores of women cravtling around
the church on tbeir knees, invoking the aid of the Almight y
for the future or His pardon for sins committed in the
past."
The treatment of the " possessed " is analogous to that
employed by many barbarous peoples for the casting out
of devils, and notably among the Chams of Cambodia (q.v.)
who force the possessed to eat garbage in order to disgust
the fiend they barbour. (See also Obsession.)
Pasqually, Martinez de: (Kabalist and Mystic}. [1715 ?-1779).
The date of Martinez Pasqualis' birth is not kuown definitely
while even his nationality is a matter of uncertainty.
It is commonly supposed, however, that he was born
about 1715, somewhere in the south of France; while
several writers have maintained that his parents were
Portugt~ese jews, but this theory has frequently been
contested. It is said that from the outset he evinced a
predilection for mysticism in its various forms, while it is
certain that, in 1754, be instituted a Kabalistic rite. which
was gleaned from Hebraic studies, and whose espousers
were styled Cohens, this being simply the Hebrew for
priests. He prQpagated this rite in divers masonic lodges
of France, notably those of :\larseilles, Toulouse, Boro:!::ou.x
and Paris; while in 1768 we find him settledin the French
capital, gathering round him many people addicted to
mysticism, and impregnating them with his theories. His
sojourn here was cut short eventually, nevertheless, for
he heard that some property had been bequeathed to him
in the island of St. Dominique. and he hastened thither
with intent to assert his rights ; but he did not return tu
France, his death occurring in 1779 at Port-au-Prince, the
principal town in the island aforesaid.
Pasqually is credited with having written a book, La
Reinltgratio11, but this was never published. As regards
t he philosophy which he promulgated, he appears to have
believed partly in the inspiration of the Scriptures. the
downhll of the angels. the theory of original sin, together
with the doctrine of justification by faith; but be seems
to have held that man existed in an elemental state long
before the creation detailed in Genesis, and was gradually
evolved into his present form. In short, Pasqually was
something of an anticipator of endless modern theorists;
nor did be fail to find a disciple who regarded him as a.
prophet and master, this being Louis Claude de St. Martin,
a theosophist frequently styled in France "le ph.ilosophe
inconnu, who founded the sect known as i\Iartinistes.
The reader will find some account ofSt. Martin in an artide
headed with his name.
.Path, The 321 Phllalethes
P ath. The : Is a term whic!J represents an important theo-
sophical teaching, and it is used in different senses to
denote not only the Path itself but also the Probationary
Path along which a man must journey before he can enter
on the former. Impelled by profound longing for the
highest, for service of God and his fellows, man first begins
the journey and he must devote hi.m.~elf wholeheartedly
to this service. AL his entrance on the Probationary
Path, he becomes the chela or disciple of one of the l'vlasters
or Perfected men who have all finished the great journP.y,
and he devotes himself to the acquiring of fonr qualifica-
tions which are (1) know·ledge of what only is real ; (2)
rejection of what is unreal ; (3) the six mental attributes
of .control over thought, control over outward action,
tolerance. endurance, faith and balance, these attributes
though all necessary in some degree, not being necessary
in perfect degree ; and (4) the desire to be one with God.
During the period of his efforts to acquire these qualifica-
tions, the chela advances in many ways, for his Master
imparts to him wise counsel ; he is taught by meditation
to attain divine heights unthought of by ordinary man; he
constantly works for the betterment of his fellows, usually
in the hones of sleep, and striving thus and in similar
directions. he fits himself for the first initiation at the
entrance to the Path proper, bul it may be mentioned that
he has the opportunity either during his probation or
afterwards to forego the heavenly life which is his due
and so to allow the world to benefit by the powers which
he 1has gained, and which in ordinary course, be would
utilise in the heavenly life. In this case, he remains in
the astr'jl.l·world, from whence he makes frequent returns to
the physical world. Of initiatiops there are four, each
at the beginning of a new stage on the Path, manifesting
the knowledge of that stage. On lhe frrst stage there are
three obstacles or, as they are commonly termed, fetters,
which must be cast aside and these are the illusion of self
which must be realised to be only an illusion; doubt which
must be cleared away by knowtedge; and superstition
'vhich must be cleared away by the discovery of what in
truth is real. This stage traversed, the second initiation
follows, and after this comes the consciousness that earthly
life will now be short, that only once again will physical
death be experienced, and the man begins more and more
to function in his mental body. After the third initiation,
the man bas two other fetters to unloose--desire and
aversion; and now his knowledge becomes keen and
Jliercing and he can gaze deep into the heart of things.
After the fourth initiation, he enters on the last sta&e and
finally frees himself of what fetters remain-the des1re !or
life whether bodily or not, and the senRe of individual
difference from his fellows. He has now reached tbe end
oi his journey, and is no long~;r trammellerl with sin or with
anything that can hinder him from entering the state of
supreme bliss where he is reuniterl with the divine con-
sciousness. (See Theosophy.)

Pearls : Occult propertie.s of. Amongst the early Greeks and
Romans, the wearing of gems as an amulet or talisman, was
much in vogue. For this purpose pearls were often made
into crowns. Rich says : ' Pope Adrian, anxious to
secure all the virtues in his favour, \Voce an amulet com·
posed of a sunbaked toad, 11rsenic, tormentil, pearl, coral,
hyacinth. smarag, and tragacanth.'·
It is also said that to dream of pearls means many tears.
Their occult virtues are brought forth by being boiled
in meat, when they heal the quartan ague: bruised and
taken with milk, they are good for ulcers, and clear the
voice. They also comfort the heart and render their
possessor chaste.

Peter of Apono : Born in rzso. at Apono, near Padua, a
philosopher, mathematician, and astrologer of no mean
skill. He practised physic in Paris with so great success
that he soon became very rich, but his wealth and attain-
ments were annulled by tlte accusation of sorcery which was
brought against him. He was said to receive instruction
in the seven liberal arts from seven spirits which he kept
in crystal vessels. To him was ascribed also the curious
and useful faculty of causing the money he spent to return
to his own purse. His downfall was brought about by an
act of revenge for which he was called to account by the
Inquisition. A neighbour ol his had been possessed of a
spring of excellent water in his garden, from which be
allowed Peter of Apono to drink at will. For some reason
or another the permission was withdrawn, and Peter, with
the assistance of the Devil, caused the water to leave the
garden and flow uselessly in some distant street. Ere the
trial was finished the unfortunate physician died, but so
bitter were the inqu~sitors against him that they ordered
his bones to be dug up and burned. This public indignity
to his memory was averted by some of his friends, who,
hearing of the vindictive sentence, secretly removed his
remain.~ from the burying-ground where they lay. The
inqui~itors thereupon satisfied their animosity by burning
him in effigy.

Phllalethes, Eirenmus : (circa, x66o) Alchemist. The life of
this alchemist is wrapped in mystery. albeit a considerable
mass of writing stands to Ius credit. The heading of this
article is, of course, mere pseudonym, and, though some
have tried bard to identify the writer who bore it with one
Thomas Vaughan, a brother of Henry Vaughan, the
" Silurist" poet, this theory is not supported by any very
sound evidence. Others have striven to identify PhilaJethes
with George Starkey, the quack doctor and author of
Liquor Alchahest ; but then, Starkey died of the pl.a.gue in
London in 1665, whereas it is known that Eirmaus was
living for some years after that date. He appears, also,
to have been on intimate terms with Robert Boyle, and,
though this points to his having spent a considerable time
in England, it is certain on the other hand that he emigrated
to America. Now Starkey, it will be remembered, was
born in the Bermudas, and practised his spurious medical
crafts in the English settlements in America, where,
according to his contemporary biographers, he met Eirent11us
Philalel/u;s. This meeting, then, may have given rise to
the identification at issue; while it is probably Starkey to
whom Eif'tmmus refers when, in a preface to one of his
books, he tells of certain of his writings falling " into the
hands of one who, I conceive, will never return them," for
in J654 Starkey issued a volume with the tiFie, The Mat'Ycnu
of Alchemy by Eirenaus Philoponus Philalethes.
Philalethes 322
It is to these prefaces br Plrilalcthe$ that we must chiefly
look for any information about him, while in the thirteenth
chapter of his Introitu< A pertus ad Occlllsum Re'iis Pnlntium
(Amsterdam, r667) he makes a few autobiographical
avowals which illuminate his character and career. ·' For
we arc like Cain, driven from the ple!lSant societr we
formerly had," he writes, and thi, SU!:'I(est~ that he was
persecuted on account of his alchemistic predilections·;
while elsewhere he heaps scorn on most of the hermetic
philosophers of his day, and elsewhere, again, he vituperates
the popular worship of money-getting. ·• I disdain, loathe,
and dete~t the idoli~ing of sih·cr and gold," he declares,
" by which the pomps and ,·anities of the world are cele-
brated. Ah ! filthy, evil, ah ! vain nothingness." That
is vigorously wTitten, and indeed nearly everythin~ from
the pen of Philalethes, whether in Latin 01 in Engli!>h,-pro-
claims him a writer of some care, skill and taste ; while
his scholarship was considerable also, and it is interesting
to find that, in his preface to Ripley Re1.:i11ed (London,
1678), he gives some account of the authors to whom he
felt himself chiefiy indebted. ·• For my own part," he
says, ·' I have cause to honour Bernard Trcvisan, who is
very ingenious, especially in the letter to Thomas of
Boulognc, when I seriously confess I receh·ed the main
light in the hidden secret. I do not remember that ever I
learnt anything from Raymond Lully.... I know of none
like Ripley, though Flame! be eminent."
Langlet du Frcsnoy, in his Histoire de la Philosophic
Hermitique, refers to numerous unpublished ma11uscripts
by Eireme•es Philaletl!c~. but nothin'( is known about these
to-day, and in conclusion it behoves only to cite the more
important of those things by the alchemist which were
issued in book form : .1/edul/a 'llchymia~ (London, 166~).

Philosopher's Stone : A substance which enabled adepts in
alchemy to compass the transmutation of metals. (See
Alchemy.) H was imagined by the alchemists that some
one definite substance wa<; ~sential to the success of the
transmutation of metals. By the application or admixture
of this substance all metals might be transmuted into
gold or sih·er. It was often designated the Powder of
Projection Zosimus, who lived at the commencement of
the fifth century is one of the first who alludes to it. He
says that the stone is a powder or liquor formed of di,·erse
metals, infusioned under a favourable constellation. The
Philosopher's Stone was supposed to contain the secret not
only of transmutation, but of health and life, for through its
agency could be distilled the Elixir of Life. It was the
touchstone of existence. The author of a TYeatise on
Pllilosopllical and Hermetic Chemistry, published in Paris
in 1725 says: "Modern philosophers have extracted from
the interior of mercury a Ctery spirit, mineral, vegetable and
mutliplicative, in a humid concavity in which is found the
primitive mercury or the universal quintessence. In the
midst of th.is spirit resides the spiritual fluid..... This is
the mercury of the philosophers, which is not solid like a
metal, nor soft like quick~ilver, but between the two.
They have retained for a long time this secret, which is the
commencement, the middle, and the end of their work·. It
is necessary then to proceed ftrst to purge the mercury
with salt and with ordinary salad vinegar, to sublime it
with vitriol and saltpetre, to dissolve it in aqua-fortis, to
sublime it again, to calcine it and fix it, to put away part
of it in salad oil, to distill this liquor for the purpose of
separating the spiritual "ater, air, and fire, to fix the
mercurial body in the spiritual water or to distill the spirit
of liquid mercury found in it, to putrefy all, and then to
raise and exalt the spirit with non-odorous white sulphur-

that is to say,sal-ammoniac-to dissolvethissal-ammoniac
in the spirit of liquid mercury which when distilled becomes

pass from gold to antimony three times and afterwards to
reduce it by beat, lastly to steep this warm gold in very
harsh vinegar and allow it to putrefy. On the surface of
the vinegar it will raise i~elf in the form of fiery earth of
the colour of oriental pearls. This is the first operation in
the grand work. For the second operation; take in the
name of God one part of gold and two parts of the spiritual
water, charged w1th the sal-ammoniac, mix this noble con-
fection in a vase of crystal of the shape of an egg : waTm
over a soft but continuous fire, and the fiery water will
dissolve little by little the gold; this forms a liquor which
is called by the sages '' chaos " containing the elementary
qualities-enid, dryness, heat and humidity. Allow this
composition to putrefy until it becomes black; this black-
ness is known as the • crow's head ' and the ' darkness of
the sages,' and makes known to the artist that he is on the
right track. It was also known as the black earth.' It
must be boiled once more in a ,·ase as white as snow; this
stage of the work is called the ' swan,' and from it arises
the white liquor, which is divided into two parts-one
white for the manufacture of silver, the other red for the
manufacture of gold. Now you have accomplished the
work, and you possess the Pltilosoplzer's Stone.
" In these diverse operati<,ns, one finds many by·
products ; among these is the ' green lion ' which is c?.lled
also 'azoph,' and which draws gold from the more ignoble
clements ; the ' red lion ' which converts the metal into
gold ; the ' head of the crow,' called also the • black veil
of the ship of Theseus,' which appearing forty days before
the end of the operation predicts its succe!>s ; the white
powder which transmutes the white metals to fine silver;
the red elixir with which gold is made ; the white elixir
which alsc m~kcs silver, and which procure<; long life-it
is also called the ' white d;~ughter of the philosophers.'"
In the lives of the ,·arious alchemists we find many
notices of the Powder of Projection in connection with
those adepts who were supposed to ha,·c arrh·ed at the
solution of the grand arcanum. Thus in the Life of Alex-
alzder Seto11 (q.v.), a Scotsman who came from Port Seton,
near Edinburgh, we fmd that on his various travels on the
continent he emplorcd in his alchemical experiments a
blackish powder, the application of which turned any
metal given him into gold. :\umerous in~tances are on
record of Seton's projections, the majority of which are
verified with great thoroughness. On one occa.~ion whilst in
Hol!and, he went with some tricnds from the house at
which he was residing to undertake an alchemical experi-
ment at another house near by. On the way thither a
quantity of ordinary zinc was purchased, and this Seton
succeeded in projecting into pure gold by the application
of his powder. A like phenomenon was undertaken by
him at Cologne, and elsewhen: throughout Germany, and
the extremest tort11re could not wring from him the secret
of the quintessence he possessed. His pupil or assistant,
Sendivogiuti, made great efforts to obtain the secret from
him before he died, but all to no purpose. However, out
of gratitude s..ton bequeathed him what remained of his
marvellous powder, which was employed by his Polish
successor with the same result<; as had been achieved in his
own case. The wretched Scndi\'ogius fared badly, however,
when the powder at last callle to an end. He bad used it
chiefiy in liquid form, and into this hf. bad dipped silver
coins which immediately had becom<' the purest gold.
Iodeed it b on record that one coin, of which he had only
immersed the half, remained for many years as a signal
instance of the claims of alchemy in a museum or collection
somewhere in South Germany. The half of this doubloon
Philosopher's Stone 323
was g;,ld, while the undipped portion had remained silver ;
but the notice concerning it is scarcely of a satisfactory
nature. \Vhen the powder gave out, Sendivogius was driven
to the desperate expedient of gilding tbc coins, which,
report says, he had heretofore transmuted by legitimate
means, and this very naturaUy brought upon him the
wrath of those who had trusted him, (See Seton.)
In the Tale of lM At1011ymous Adept we also lind a powder
in use, and indeed the powder ~eems to have been the
b,·oured form of the transmuting agency. The term
Pltilosopltu's Stone probably arose from some Eastern
talismanic legend. Yet wr! find in Egyptian alchemy-
the oldest-the idea of the black powder- the detritus or
oxide of all the metals mingled. (See Egypt.)
The Philosopher's Slone had a spiritual a'! well as a
material conception attached to it, and indeed spiritual
alchemy is practicaUy identified ""·ith it ; but we do not
find the first alchemists, nor those of medi:eval times,
poss~ssed of any spiritual ideas ; their hope was to
manufacture real gold, and it is only in later time5 ~hat we
find the altraistic idea creeping in, to t11e detriment of the
physical one. Symbolic language was largely used by
both schools, however, and we must not imagine that
because a:1 alchemical writer employs symbolical figures of
speech that he is of the transcendental school, as his
desire was merely to be undcrstanded of his brother adepts,
and to conserve his secret from the vulgar. (See Alchemy.)

Phreno-Mesmerism (or Phrenopathy) : An application of the
principles of .\1esmerism to the science of phrenology.
,\1emHrism and phrenology had for some time been regarded
by the English mesmerists as related sciences when it was
discovered that a somnambule whose " bumps " were
touched by the fingers of the operator would respond to
the stimulus by exhibiting every symptom of the meatal
trait corresponding to the organ touched. Thus signs of
joy, grid, destructiven~. combativeness, and friendship
might be exhibited in rapid succession by the entranced
patieat. Among those who claimed to have discovered
the new science were Dr. Collyer, a pupil of Dr. Elliotson's ;
and the Rev. Laroy Sunderland, though the former after-
wards repudiated it. As time went on enterprising
phreno-mesmerists di~covered many new cerebral organs
as many as a hundred and fifty being found beside those
already mapped out by Spurzheim and Gall. Among its
supporters plzreno·mesmeYism numbered the distinguished
hypnotist Braid, who expressed himself fully satisfied of its
reality. He has recorded a· number of cases in which the
patient correctly indicated by his actions the organs
touched, though demonstrably ignorant of phrenological
laws, and inaccessible to outside information. Rraid
himself offers but a very halting and inadequate physiologi·
cal explanation, and since he may be supposed to have
been fully alive to the factors of t;uggestion and hyper·
ro<sthesia, 1t would seem advisable to admit the possibility of
mental suggestion, or telepathy, by means of which the
expectation of lhe operator, reproducing itself in the
mind. of the patient, would give rise to the corresponding
reactiOn'\.
Phrygian Cap : Hargrave jennings, in his Rosicrucians.
Their Rites 011d Mysteries, says that the Phrygian Cap, the
clas~ic }Iithraic Cap, sacrificial Cap, and mitre all derive
from one common ance.>tor. The Mithraic or Phrygian
Cap is the origin of the priestly mitre in all faiths. It was
worn by the priest in sacJifice. \\'hen worn by a male,
it had its crest, comb, or point, set jutting forward ; when
worn by a female, it bore the same prominent part of the
cap in reverse, or on the nape of the neck, as in the instance
of the Amazon's helmet, displayed in all old scupltures, or
Phrygian Cap
that of Pallas-Athcnc, as exhibited in the figures of ~finerva.
The peak, pic, or point, of caps or hats (the term •· cocked
hat" is a ease in point) all refer to the same idea. This
point had a sanctifying meaning afterwards attributed to it,
when it was callod the christa, crista, or crest, which
signifies a triumphal top, or tuft. The " Grenadier Cap,"
and the loose blac,k Hussar Cap, derive remotely from the
same sacred, :>rlithraic. or emblematieal bonnet, or high
pyramidal cap. It, in this instance, changes to black,
because it is devoted to the lllustration of the " fire-
workers" (grenadiers) who, among modern military,
succeed the Vulcanists, Cyclopes, classic "smiths," or
servants of Vulcan, or 1\!ulciber, the artful worker among
the metals in the fire, or amidst the forces of nature. This
idea '~ill be found by a reference to the high cap among
the Persians, or Fire-worshippers; and to the black cap
among the Bohemians, and in the Easl. All travellers In
Eastern lands will remember that the tops of the minarets
reminded them of the high-pointed black caps of the
Persians.
The Phrygian Cap is a most recondite antiquarian form ;
the symbol comes from the highest antiquity. It is dis·
played on the head of the figure sacrificing in the cele·
brated sculpture, called the ")'Iithraic Sacrifice " (or the
Mythical Sacrifice) in the British Museum. This loose
cap. with the point protruding, gives the original form
from which all helmets or defensive headpieces. whether
Greek or Barbarian, deduce. As a Phrygian Cap, or
Symbolising Cap, it is always saQguine in its colour. It
then stands a.s the" Cap of Liberty " a revolutionary form ;
also, in another way, it is even a civic or incorporated
badge. It is always masculine in its meaning. It marks
the " needle" of the obelisk, the crown or tip of the
phallus, whether " human " or representative. It bas
its origin in the rite of circumcision-unaccountable as are
both the symbol and the rite.
The real meaning of the bonnet rouge, or cap of liberty,
has been involved from time immemorial in deep obscurity,
noh~;thstanding that it has always been regarded as the
most important bieroglyph or fi.gure. It signifies the
supernatural simultaneous " sacrifice" and " triumph."
It has descended from the time of Abraham, and it is
supposed to emblem the strange mythic rite of the " cir-
cumcisio preputii," The loose Phrygian bonnet conique,
or " cap of liberty," may be accepted as figuring, or stand-
ing for, that detached integument or husk, separated from
a certain point or knob, which has various n~ mes in different
languages, and which supplies lhe central idea of this
sacrificial rite-the spoil or refuse of which (absurd and
unpleasant as it may seem) is borne aloft at once as a
" trophy " and as the " cap of liberty." It is now a magic
sign, and becomes a talisman of supposedly inexpressible
power-from what particular dark reason it may be
difficult to say. The whole is a sign of " initiation," and
of baptism of a peculiar kind. The Phrygian Cap, ever
after this first inauguration, has stood as the sign of the
" Enlightened." The heroic figures in most Gnostic Gems,
have caps of this kind. The sacrificer in the sculptured
group of the " Mithraic Sacrifice," among the marbles in
the British J\Iuseum, has a Phrygian Cap on his head,
whilst in the act of striking the bull with the poniard-
meaning the office of the immolating priest. The bonnet
conique is the mitre of the Doge of Venice.
Cinteotl, ?. Mexican god of sacrifice, wears such a cap
made from the thigh-skin of an immolated virgin. This
head-dress is shaped like a cock's comb.
Besides lhe bonnet rouge, the Pope's mitre-nay, all
mitres or conical head-coverings-have their name irom
the terms " Mithradic," or " Mithraic," The origin ofthe
whole class of names is Mittra, or Mithra. The cap of the
Phyllorbodomancy 324 Plancbette
grenadier, the shape oJ wrucb is alike all over Europe, is
related to the Tartar lambskin caps, which are dyed·black;
and it is black also from its associations with Vulcan and
the " Fire-worshippers " (Smiths). The Scotch Glengarry
cap will prove on examination to be only a " cocked"
Phrygian. AJJ the black conical caps, and the meaning
of this strange symbol, came from the East. The loose
black fur cap derives from the Tartars.
The " Cap of Liberty" (Bonnet Rouge), the Crista or
Crest (::1-iale}, and the Female (Amazon} helmet, all mean
the same idea : in the instance of the female crest the knob
is, however, depressed.
Phyllorbodomancy : Divination by rose-leaves. The Greeks
clapped a rose-leaf on the hand, and judged from the
resulting soand the s uccess or otherwi~e of their desires.
Physical World : Formerly known as the Sthula Plane-is
in the theosophic scheme of thin~s the lowest of the seven
worlds, the world in which ordinary man moves and is
conscious under normal conditions. It is the limit of the
ego's descent into matter, and the matter which composes
the appropriate physical body, is the densest of any of these
worlds. Physical matter has the seven divisions of solid,
liquid, gas, ether, super-ether, sub-atom and atom, in
l:ommon with the matter of the other worlds. Besides the
physical body, familiar to ordinary vision, there is a finer
body, the etheric dOllble, which plays a very important
part in collecting vitality from the sun for the use of the
denser physical body, and reference is made to the articles
on the Etheric Body, and Chaksams. At death, the
physical body and the etheric double are cast aside and
slowly resolve into their components. (See Worlds, Planes

Pierart, z. T. : French Spiritualist and editor of La Revue
Spiritualiste. M. Periart was born in humble circumstances
but managed to secure for himself an adequate education.
He became in time professor at the College of ;\1aubcuge,
and afterwards ~ecretary to Baron Du Potet. In 1858 he
founded La Revue Spiritualiste, and led the F rench spirit-
ualists, between whom and the spiritists under Allan
Kardec there existed a certain rivalry. Until his death in
x878 he continued to devote his time and talents to the
movement with which he had identified himself.

Piper, Mrs. : A famous trance l"(ledium, whose discourses and
writings present the best evidence extant for the actuality of
spirit communication. A native of America, it was there
that l\1rs. Piper first became entranced, while consulting a
professional clairvoyant in 1884. Numerous spirits pur·
ported to control her in these early days-Mrs. Siddons,
L~mgfello1v, Bach, to mention only the most celebrated-
but in r885, when she came under the observation of the
Society for Psychical Research, her principal control was
Dr. Phinuit. From that time forward her trance utterances
and writings-for after 1890 the communications were
generally in writing- were carefully recorded and analysed
by members of the S.P.R., chiefly under the direction of
Dr. Hodgson. In r889-90 Mrs. Piper visited this country
and gave many seances, most of which seemed to display
supernormal powers in the medium. It is impossible in a
limited space to detail her remarkable trance impersonations.
On his de1.th in 1905 Dr. Hodgson became one of her
controls; Mr. Myers and Mr. Gurney also controlled her.
But perhaps the most life-like and convincing impersonation
or spirit-manifestation-whichever it may have been- was
that of George Pelham, a young American author and a
friend of Dr. Hodgson, who had died suddenly in 1892.
(See Trance Personalities.} The information given by this
control, his recognition of friends, and so on, were so accurate
as to convince many that it was indeed " G.P:• \vho spoke.
From that time until 1896 the seances were especially
productive, but in the latter year the medium underwent
an operation Phinuit, who o!len acted as a go-between
for otLer controls and the sitter, now took his departure,
and a band of other spidts, led by the " Imperator " of
Staioton Moses, took control of Mrs. Piper's organism.
The trance "'ritings and utterances became fewer, and the
spirits recommended that the number of sittings be cut
down on account of the medium's health. Nevertheless
some excellent tests were subsequently got v.-ith the Piper-
Hodgsoo, Piper-Myers, and Piper-Gurney controls. Jl.frs.
Piper was also one of those who look part in the " cross-
COlrespondences" sittings held in 19o6 and onwards, tho
other mediums being Mrs. Th:>mpson, Mrs. Verrall, l\fiss
Verrall, Mrs. Holl:md, :.rrs. Forbes, etc. (See " Spiritual-
ism, and Cross-Correspondences.} It seems clear that in
]11rs. Piper's trance phenomena there a re evidences of some
supernormal faculty, at the best, of telepathy, though to
the writer even that hypothesis seems to be inadequate.
It would, for example, be a very complicated form of
telepathy, that would enable some of these a utomatic
" cross-correspondence " scripts to be written, in which,
say, two scripts contain allusions unintelligible to the
writers, and rcq_uiring a key provided by a third script to
make them plam. Such a case inevitably suggests that
one a nd the same intelligence directs all three mediums.
Mrs. Piper's impersonation of George Pelham, again, calls
for some explanation. since it would seem that all the
information could hardly have been culled from the sitter's
minds. (See Spiritualism.)
Planehette : An instrument designed for the purpose of
communication with spirits. It consists of a thin-heart-
shaped piece of wood, mounted on two small wheel-castors
and carrying a pencil, point downwards, for the third
support. The hand is placed on the wood and the pencil
writes automatically, or presumably by spirit control
operating through the psychic force of the medium.
In x853, a well-known F rench spiritualist, M. Pla.nchette,
invented this instrument to which he gave his name. For
quite fifteen years it was used exclusively by French
spiritualists. Then in the year 1868 a firm of toy-ma kers
in America took up the idea and flooded the booksellers·
shops with great numbers of plancheUes. It became a
popular mania, and the instrument sold in thousands there
and in Great Britain. It was, and is, largely used simply as
a toy and any results obtained th'lt may bearresting and
seemingly inexplicable are explained by Animal Magnetism
or traced to the power of subconscious thought.
Amongst spiritualists it has been used for spirit com-
munication. Automatic writing has oft•' n been developed
by use of the planchctle, some mediums publishing books
which, they claimed, were written wholly by their spirit-
controls through the use of ptanclzettes. Dr. Ashburnes, in
his Spiritualism Chemically Explai11ed says that the human
bod y is a condensation of gases, which constantly exude
from the skin in invisible vapour-otherwise electricity ;
that the fingers coming in contact with the planchette
transmit to it an " odic force," and thus set it in motion.
He goes on to say that some people ha ve phosphorous in
excess in their system a nd the vapour " thus exuded forms
a positively Jiving, thinking, acting body, capable of
d irecting a pencil." There are variations on the p!anchelle
form such as the dial-planchetle which consists of a founda-
tion of thick cardboard nine inches square on the face of
which the alphabet is printed and also the numerals one to
teo. There are the words "Yes," "No," "Goodbye"
and "Don't know." These letters, words, and numerals
are printed on the outer edge of a circle, the diameter of
which is about seven inches. In the centre of this circle,
and firmly affixed to the cardboard, is a block of wood three
Pl.anehette 325
inches squat·e. The upper surface of this block has a
circular channel in it and in this run balls. Over the balls
is placed a circular piece of hard wood, five inches in
diameter, and attached to the outer edge of this a pointer.
The upper piece of wood is attached to the lower by an
ordinary screw, upon which the upper plate revolves when
used for communication. Another form is the Ouija board
on which in a convenient 01dcr the letters of the alphabet are
printed and over which a pointer easily moves under the
direction of the band of the person or persons acti.."g as
mediums. It is stated that a form of this " mystic toy"
was in use in the days of Pythagoras, abo11t 540 B.C. In
a French history of Pythagoras, the authcr describing his
celebrated school of philosophy, a-;serts that the brother-
hood held frequent seances o. circles at which a mystic
table, moving on wheels, moved towards signs inscribed on
the surface of a stone slab on which the moving-table
worked. The author states that probably Pythagoras, in
his travels among the Eastern nations, observed some
such apparatus in use amongst them and adapted his idea
from them. Another trace of some such " communicating
mechanism " is found in the legend told by the Scan-
dinavian Blomsturvalla how the people of Jomsvikingia in
the twelfth century had a high priest, one Volsunga, whose
predictions were renowned for their accuracy throughout
the length and breadth of the land. He had in his p:>sses-
sion a little ivory doll that drew with " a pointed instru-
ment" on parchment or" other substance," certain signs
to which the priest had the key. The communications
were in every 'case prophetic utterances, and it is said in
every case came true. The writer who recounts the legend
thought it probable that the priest had procured the doll in
China. In the National ;\fuseum at Stockholm there is a
doll of this description which is worked by mechanism, and
when wound up walks round and round in circles and
occasionally uses its right arm to make curious signs with
a pointed instrument like a stylo which is held in the hand.
Its origin and use have been connected with the legend
recounted above.
Planet ; (See Planetary Cbalns.)
Planetary Logos, or Ruler of Seven Chains, is, in the thea-
sophie scheme, one of the grades in the hierarchy which
assists in the work of creation and guidance. It is the
supreme Logos who initiates this work, but in it he is
helped by the " seven." They receive from him the
inspiration and straightway each in his own Planetary
Chain carries on the work, directed by him no doubt, yet
in an individual fashion, through all the succ~ive stages
which go to compose a Scheme of Evolution. (See Logos,
Cbalns.)
Planetary Spirits : In the theosophical scheme the number
of these spirits is seven. They are emanations from the
Absolute, and arc the agents by which the Absolute effects
all his changes in the Universe.

Poltergeist : The name given to the supposed supernatural
causes of outbreaks of rappings, inexplicable noises, and
similardisturbances, which from time to tim~ have mystified
men of science as well as the general public. The term
poltugeist (i.e., Potter r.eist, rattling ghost) is sufficiently
indicative of the character of these beings, whose manifesta-
tions are, at the best, puerile and purposeless tricks, and not
infrequently display an openly mischievous and destructive
tendency. The poltergeist IS by no means indigenou~ to any
one country, nor has he confined his attentions to any
particular period. Lang mentions several cases belonging
Poltergeist
to the l\1iddle Ages, and one at least which dates so far back
as 856 B.C. In both savage and civilised countries this
peculiar form of haunting is well known, and it is a curious
fact that the phenomena are almost identical in eve:y case.
The disturbances are always observed to be parhcularly
active in the neighbourhood of one person, g~eral_ly a
child or a young woman, and preferably an ep1lept1c or
hysterical subject. According to the theory advanced by
spiritualists, this centre of the disturbances is a na!W"al
rt:>edium, through whom the spirits desire to commurucate
v.-ith the world of living beings. ln ear~e~ times su~h a
person was regarded as a v. itch, or the v1ctlm of a Witch,
whichever supposition was best fitted to the chcumsta~ces.
The poltergeist is represented as ~ development from Witch-
craft, and the direct forerunner of modern ~piritualism, and
is, in fact, a link between the two.
Turning our attention first to some of the earlier records,
we may consider briefly the case of the DrummerofTcdworth
(1661).• and the Epworth Case (1716). In both of these
instances the manifestations witnessed were of the usual
order. The spirits, if spirits they were, sought to a_ttract
attention bv familiar childish tricks, and commumcated
by means of the same cumbrous process of knocking. The
circumstances of the first-named instance are as follow :
In 1661 a vagrant drummer was, at the instance of Mr.
Mompesson of Tedworth, taken before a Justice of the
Peace, and deprived of his drum, which instrument finally
found a resting-place in the house of Mr. Momp~on,
during that gentleman's absence from home. Immed1atcly
violent disturbances broke out in the house. Loud knock-
ings and thumpings were heard, and the beating of an
invisible drum. Articles fiew recklessly about the room~.
and the bedsteads (particularly those in which the younger
children lay) were violently shaken. After a hme the
drummer was transported, when the manifestations abruptly
ceased, but a recurrence of the outbreak synchronised
with his return. Contemporary opinion put the case down
to v.;tchcraft on the part of the drummer, but ~lr. Podmore
and other moderns incline to the belief that the " two
little modest girls i~ the bed ". had more than. a little to
do with the mystenous knockings and scratchings of the
poltergeist. In the famous Epworth Case, wh~re the
phenomena is well attested by the whole Wesley fanuly, a~d
described in numerous contemporary letters, the dlS·
turbances comprised all the ordinary manifestatio~s of
levitations, loud and terrifying noises, and rappmgs,
together with apparitions of rabbits, badgers, and so on.
Podmore is of the opinion that one of the daughters,
Hetty, was in some way implicated in the affair. She alone
did not give an account of the manifestations, though_she
had promised to do so. The poltugeist showe~ a dec1ded
partiality for her company- a circumstance wh1ch, tbou~h
not unobserved, does not seem to have held any special
significance for her fam!IY·. A more _
recent ca~e i~ which a
charge of witchcraft 1s mvolved, IS the C1dCv1lle case,
described by Mr. Lang in his Cork La11e and Commo11 Sense,
under the heading, ·· A Modern Trial for Witchcraft."
In 1849 the Cure of Cidevillc, Seine Inferieure, was sum-
moned to court by ~ shepherd named Thorel, who allege?
that the Cure had dcpounccd him for sorcery. In hts
defence the Cure stated thatThorel himself hadconfessed to
having produced by means of sorcery certain mysterious
manifestations which had disturbed the inmates of the
Abbey. During the trial it transpired that the Cure, ~ben
visiting a sick parishioner, had _
driven fr<!m the be~s1de a
man of notorious character, w1th an ev1l reputation for
sorcery, who was about to treat the patient. The sorcerer
retired, vov.;ng vengeance on the Cure, and was shortly
afterwards sent to prison. Later when two little boys.
pupils of the Cure, were at an auction, they were approached
Poltergeist 326 Polynesia
by Thorel, who was known ts a diSCiple of the sorcere•.
He placed hi> hand O'l th~ he:td of o:te or the children. and
m:.ttered some stra.'lge word;. Witen the boys returned
to tbc Abbey the f'13!ler'J:ist prrform'\nccs com:nenccd.
Violent blow.> on the w~lls seemed about to demolish them.
one of Ute children com?l.ii'led that he w.1s followed by a
man's shadow, and other witno::sses declared that i.hey bad
seen a grey hand and wreaths of smoke. Some of those
who visited the Abbey were abl~ to hold n conversation with
the spirits by mean~ of knocking. It was agreed that
sharp-pointed irons should J:>e driven into the walls, and on
tl-)is being done, ~moke and fla:ne~ were seen to is~ue from
the incisions. At last Thorel sougl1t the Cure and confessed
that the disturbances we;e th·: wllrk of his ma~ter, the
sorcerer. The plaintiff was non-suited, and the judge, in
summing up, said that the cause of the ·• extraordinary
facts" of this case " remained unkno.vn." In February,
r851, the boys were removed fro:n the Abbey, and the
disturb:tnces ceased.
Of those instances whe•~ a spiritualistic explanati:ln has
bc.!n offered perhaps thz m·Ht O.Jt~tanlli ng is lhc case of
the Cock L:tne Ghost, almo·;t too wcll-kn•>wn to call for
re.:'lpitulation. lil 176r- 2 r:t?S and scratches were heard in
:t house in Cock Lane, gener.\lly occurring ncar the bed of
the little daughter of the house. F.:liubeth Parsons. Very
soon the m'\nifestations became so pronounced that people
fro:n all parts of the city were crowding to witness them.
A code of raps was agrt--ed upon, through which it was
ascertained that the spirit was that of a lady named
" Fanny," who declared that she had been poisoned by
her deceased sister's husband, with whom she had lodged
in the Cock Lam: house som:: two yc:\rs previously, and
expressed 1\ wisb that he might be h:mged. lt is, indeed,
quite a common thing for the poltergeist to revc;;.l a crim:.
real or imaginary-at!'J more oft~n the latter, which tS
entirely in keeping with the ch~ractcr of the spirit. In the
Cock Lane affair the m.1nifestations followed the girl whe11
she was removed to another house, and she trembled
strongly, even in her sleep, on the approach of the ghost.
The c:tse which presents the most formidably array of
evidence, however, is that of the Jolter family in Switzer-
land. In 186o-2 serious disturbances broke out in Stans,
in the home of :\I. Joller, a prominent law)•er, and a man of
excellent character. Knocks were first heard by a servant-
m'\id, who also averred that she wa<; haunted by strange
grey shapes, and the sound of sobbing. In '-"le autumn of
1861, she was dismissed and another m'\id engaged. Foro:.
time there was peace, but in the summer of t86z they
commenced with redoubled vigour. The wife and seven
children of~[. Jolter heard and saw m~ny terrifying sig?:tts
and sounds, but :.\1. Joller himself remained sceptical. At
length, however, even he was convinced that neither
trickery nor inugination w~)uld suffice as :tn explanation
of the phenomena. :\{eanwhilc the m:tnifestations oocamc
more and more oatrageous, and continued iu full view of
the thousands of persons who were attracted by curiosity
to the house, including the Land-Captain Zeiger, the
Director of Police Jaun, the President of the Court of
Justice, and other promincilt people, some of who:n sug·
gested th\t a commissioa be appointed to exa:nine the house
thoroughly. Three of the hc<ld3 of police were deputed to
conduct the enquiry. They demanded the withdrawal of
M. Joller and his family, and remained in the house for six
days with<rut witnessing anything abnormal, and drew
up a report to this effect. Directly the Jollcr family entered
the bou~e the i:lter~uption5 wue renew.!d. :\I. Joller
becam~ the butt of ridicule to all, even his political and
person\) friends, and wa~ finally compelle<I to quit hi3
ancestral home. This is undoubtedly one or the most
striking cases of poltergeist haunting on record. Here, as
in almo;t e,·ery instance, there are cluldren e,·idently and
intimately bound up with the tn'lntfesta.tions. It is !lis
chnice of a me<lium "·hich has dir~cted most suspicion to
the p.,lfergtisl, and it on this that :\lr. Podmore bases his
assumption that all poltergeist visitations :>.re traceable to
the cunning tricks of " naughty little girls." He suggests
that with the •· medium" under careful control it is more
than probable that the p11ttergeist will turn shy, anrl refuse
to perform his traditional functions I There is much to be
said for this theory. The medium of the spiritualistic
seance is frequently credited with the loftiest utterances,
and the production of literary, musical, :md artistic com-
poc;itions. The pollergeist indulges in such futilities as the
breaking of crockery, the throwing about~~ fumiturc, :'-nd
the materialization of coal and carrots •n the drawmg-
room. Whv, if they are mature spirits, as they purport
to be, shouid they practise such fe:lts of mystific:.tion as
would seem to be impelled either by the foolish vanity of a
child, or the cunning impulses of a deranged mind ? ~heu
there is often a curious hesitancy on the part of the mcd1um,
1\S in the case of Hetty Wesley, a trembling on the approach
of tbe phenomena., and a tendency to such phy~1cal diS·
turba,lccs as epileptic and other fits. And sometimes the
poltergeist confesses, as did the maid-serv-ant Ann at Stock·
well, to having manipulated the disturbing occurrences
with the aid of wires and horsehair. But in such a case a.s
that of the Jolter family, the theory of " naughty little
girls " is childishly inadequate. lt is all but impossible
to believe that children could produce the manifestations
in full view of hundreds of people. It is still more difficult
to understand how children and ignorant persons, with
presumably no knowledn-e of previous instances, could fix
upon exactly the same
0
phcnomena which bas beeu pr?·
duced by the poltugeisls of every age and chme. And m
the Jolter case, there is the evidence of many spectators
that the most violent disturbances were witnessed when
the whole family were assembled outside the house and
thus not in a position to assist the manifestations, which
included the throwing open of all windows. doors, cup-
boards and drawers, the ma.tcrialir.ation of the " thin grey
cloud," noises and apparitions. In short, it must be
admil.lcd that there is an element of mystery which co:.lls
!or elucidation, and which the most. scientific and critical
minds have hitherto failed to make clcar.
Polynesia : l\Iagic in Polynesia is the preserve of the prie;,tly
a.nd upper classes, althougll lesser sorcery is pr;;.ctised by
individuals not of these castes. There is a prevailing
belief in what is known as mana, or supernatural power,
which is resident in certain indi,·idual~. The method of
usin:> this power is twofold. One of these is practised by
a soc'iety known as the Inial, where certain rites are carried
out wltich are supposed to brin~ calamity upon the euo::.mies
of the trib:~. The ability to exercise m:1gic is known as
agagara, and the magician or wizard is tena aga~ara. If the
wizard desires to cast magic upon another man, he usually
tricJ to secure something that that person has touched with
his mouth, and to guard against this, the natives are careful
to destroy all food-refuse tha.t they do not corrsu:ne, and
they carefully gather up even a single drop of blood when
they receive a cut or scratch, and butn it or throw it into
the sea, so that the wizard may not obtain it. 'The wizard
having obtaine-1 something belonging to the person whom
he wishes to injure, buries it in a deep hole, together with
leaves of poisonous plants and sharp-pointed piece; of
bamboo, accompanying the actioa by suitable incantation~.
If he ch:J.nce~ to be a m~:nb~r of the Inial society, he will
place on the top of the whole one uf their sacred stones, as
they beli~v~ that so long as the stone is pressing down the
article which has been buried in the hole the man to whom
it belonged will remain sick. Immediately a man falls
P olynesia 327 Polynesia
sick, he sets enquiries on foot as to who has bewitched him,
and there i;; always someone to acknowledge the soft
unpeachment. If he doe.; not succeed in ha,·ing the spell
removed he will almost certainly succumb, but I! he succeeds
in having it taken away, he begin;; tO recover almost
immediately ; and the strdnge thing is that he evinces no
enmity towards the person or persons who " 1-,e"-itched "
him,-indeed it io; tal:cn .-.s a matter of course, and he
quietly waits the time when he will be able to return the
compliment !
These remarks apply for the most part to :'\ew Britain,
and it:> system of magic is practically the same as that
known in Fiji as vak(l(/ratmikau concerning which very
little is known. Tn his work Jlela11esia11S a:zd Polynesians
1he Rev. Dr. George Brown, the well-kuown· pioneer
missionary and explorer, gives an iutcresting account of
the magi.:al systems of these people, in which he k'lCOr-
porates several informative letter:> from brother missiol~­
aries, which arc well worth quotation. For example, the
Rev. \V. E. Bromilow says that at Dobu in south-eastern
New Guinea :-
•· Werabana (evil spirits} are those which inhabit dark
places, and wander in the night, and gi\·e witches their
power to smite all round. flarau is the wizardry of men,
who look with angry eyes out of dark places, ;tnd throw
small stones, first spitting on them, at men, women, and
even children, thus causing death. A tree falls, it is a
witch who caused it to do so, though the tree may be quito
rotten, or a gust of wind may break it off. A man meets
with a.n a.:cident, 1t is the weraba;Ja. He is getting better
'through the influence of the medicine-man, but has a
relapse; this is the bara" at work, a.s we have ascertained
!rom the terrified shouts of our workmen, as some sleeper
has called out in a horrid dream. These medicine-men,
ioo, have great power, and no wonder, when one of our
girls &ets a little dust in her eye, and the doctor takes <1 big
stone out of it ; and wheu a chief has a pain in the chest,
and to obaoba takes therefrom a two·inch nail.
·'The people here will have it that all evil spirits are
female. Weraba<r:z is the great word. but the term is
applied to witches as well, who are c.tlled the vesses of the
werabana, bu: more oiten tile single word is used. I have
the names of spirits inhabiting the gle:1s and fore;;ts, bot
they arc <Lil wome:1 or ente; into women, giving them
terrible powers. Whenever any one is sick, it is the wera-
balla who has ca.u-;ed the iilness, and any oh.l woman who
happened to be at entnity with the sick person is set down
as the cause. A child died th.;: other d,\y, and the friends
were quite angry be.:.J.usc the witch!!> bad not heeJed the
words of the iotu, ·•.e., the Christian 't'eligion Taparoro, and
given up smi6ng the little ones. Tnese are times of
peace,' said they, · why should the child die then ? ' We,
of course, took the opportu.tity and tried to teach them that
sickness c.-tuscd death without the influence of poor old
wmnen.
"Sorcerers :\ro barau, men whose powers are more
terrible than those O( all the witches, ( WJ.S talking to a
to obaoba-medicine-man-thc other day, and 1 asked him
why his taking a stone out o! a nnn's chest did not cure
him. ' Oh,' said he, he must have been smitten by :1.
baYaa.' A v.e<y logical statement this. Cases the to
obaoba cannot cure are under the fell stro<e of the barau,
from which there is no escape, e~cept by the sorcerer's own
incantations.
·· The Fijian sorcery of dra•H1i•ka1t appears here in
another io.:m called suMana or rubbish. The sorcerer
obtains posse:;sion of a small portion of his victim's hair, o~
skin, or food left after a meal, and carefully wraps it up in
a parcel, which he sends off to as great a distance a> is
possible. In the mea:ttime he very cunningly cause;; a
report of the stmuwa to be made knowu to the man whom
he wishes to kill, and the poor fellow 1S put into a great
fright and dies."
The Rev. S. B. Fellows ~ivcs the following account of
the belieis of the people of Kiriwina (Trobiands group) :-
·• The so(cerers, who arc very numerous, are credited
"-ith the power of creating the wind and rain, of making the
g:u-dens to be either fruitful or barr<•n, and of causing sick-
ness which leads to death. Their methods of operation are
le;:on. The great chief, who is also the principal sorcerer,
claims the sole right to secure a bountiful harvest every
year. This function is considered of transcendent im-
portance by the people. .
" Our big chief, Bulitara. was asking me oue day 1f I
had these occult powers. When 1 told him that I made
no such cl?.im, he said, · Who makes the wind and the ram
and the harvest in your land ? ' I answered, ' God.'
'Ah,' said he, ' that's it. God docs this work for your
people. :\nd I do it !or our people. God and I are equaL'
He delivered this dictum very quietly, and with the a1r
of a man who ha<i given a most satisfactory explanation.
" But the one great dread that darkens the life of every
native is the lear of the bogau, the sorcerer who has the
power to cause sickness and death.. who, in th~ da~k~~:ess
of the night, steals to the house of. Ius unsuspcctmg v1ctu!l•
and places near the doo;·step a few leaves from a c_erta•!l
tree, containing the mystic power which he, by h1s ~vtl
arts, has imparted to them. The doomed man, 011 g01ng
out of his house next morning, unwittingly steps over the
fatal !!"aves and is at once stricken down by a mortal
sickness. Internal disease of every kind is set down to this
agency. Bulitara told me the mode of his witchcraft.. He
boils his decoctions, containing numerous ingredients, 1n a
special cooking-pot on a small fire, in the secret recesses of
his owu house, at the dead of night ; and while the pot is
boilino he speaks into it an incantation known only to a
few p~rsons. The bunch of leaves dipped in this is at once
ready for use. Passing through the villages the other day,
l came across a woman, apparently middle-aged, who was
evidently suffering from a wa~ting disease, she was so. thtn
and worn. I asked if she had any pain, and her fncnds
said · No.' Then they explained that some bogau was
socking her blood. I said, · How does he do it ? ' ' Oh,'
they said, · that is known only to herself. He manages to
get her blood which makes him strong, while she gets
weaker every day, and if he goes on much longer she will
die.'
" Deformities at birth, a.ud being born dumb or blind,
are attribut.cd to the evil influence oi disembodied spirits,
who inhabit a lower region called Tltma. Once a year tile
spirit> of tiH' ancestors visit their native village in a body
after the harvest is gathered. At this time the men
perform spedal dances, the people openly display their
valuables, spread out 0:1 platforms, and great feasts are
made for the spirits. On a certain night, when the moon
named Namarama is at tho full, all the people-men. women
and children-join in raising a great shout, and so drive the
spirits back to Tuma.
·• A peculiar Ctlstom prevail:; o'f wearing, as charms,
various parts of the body of a deceased relative. On her
breast, suspended by a piece of string round her neck, a
widow wears her late husband's lower jaw, the full set of
teeth loo:Ong ghastly and grim. The small bones of the
arrns and legs are taken. out soon after death, and formed
into spoo:1.s, which are used to put lime into the mouth when
eating betel-nut. Only this week a chief <.lied in a village
three mile:> from us, and a leg and an arm, for the above
purpose, were bro<lght to our village by some relatives as
their portion of their dead friend.
•· An evidence of the passionate nature of this people is
Polynesia 328 Precipitation
seen in the comparatively frequent attempts at suicide.
Their method is to climb into the top branches of a high
tree, and, after tying the ankles together, to throw them-
selves down. During the last hvclvc months two attempts
near our home 'vere successful, and several others were
prevented. In some cases the causes '"ere trivial. One
young man allowed his anger to ma~ter him because his
wife had smoked a small piece of tobacco belonging to him ;
he fell from the tree across a piece of root, which \vas above
ground and broke his neck. A woman, middle-aged and
childless,-who had become jealous, climbed into a tree near
her house, and calling out " ~od-bye • to her brother in
the village. instantly threw herself down. Falling on her
head she died in a few hours; the thick skin on the scalp
was cut, but so far as I could see the skull was not broken."
Some of the minor magical customs of Poly11esia are
worthy of note. Xatives of the Duke of York group
believe that by persistent calling upon a man whom they
wish to get hold of he will by their call be drawn to them,
even from a great distance. The natives will not eat
or drink \Vhen at sea. In ~ew Guinea and Fiji the custom
prevails of cutting off a finger joint in token of mourning
for a near relative, as do the bushmen of South Africa.
(See Magic, Prehistoric.) They firrnly belie,•e in mer-
maids, tailed men and dwarfs ; and reg<~.rding these
they are most positive in their assertions. The natives of
the Duke of York group in fact declared to a missionary
that they had caught a mermaid, who had married a
certain native, and that the pair had several of a family ;
" but unfortunately," says the relater of this story, •· I
could never get to see them." Like many other races, the
Polynesians work themseh·es into a great state of terror
whene,·er an eclipse takes place, and during the phenome-
non they beat drums, shout and in,·oke their gods.
In Samoa magic is not practised to such an extent as in
other :\Ielanesian groups, although the sorcerer still exists.
He is, however, much more sophisticated, and instead of
asking merely for any trifling object connected with the
person whom he desires to bewitch, he demands property,
such as valuable mats and other things which are of use
to him. His modzl$ opera11di was to get into communication
"?th his god, who entered the sorcerer's body, which became
VIOlently contorted and convulsed. The assembled nati,·es
would then hear a voice speaking from behind a screen,
probably a ventriloquial effort, which asserted the presence
of the god im·oked. Sickness was generally belie,•ed to be
caused by the anger of some god, who could thus be con-
cealed by the priest or u;:tard and duly placated. The
"god" invariably required some present of substantial
,·a.Ju~. such as a piece of land, a canoe, or other property,
an~ 1f the pn~t happens to know of a particularly valuable

This caste of pnests IS 1..-nown as taula-aitu, and also act as
medicine-men.
Polytrix : This is almost the only example of an inauspicious
stone. It caused the hair to fall off the head of anyone
who had it about his person.
Pontiea : A blue stone with red stars, or drops and lines like
blood. It compels the devil to ans,ver questions, and puts
him to flight.
Poppy Seeds : Divination by smoke '~as sometimes practised
by magi~ns. A few jas~e or poppy seeds were flung
upon burrung coals, for this purpose; if the smoke rose
lightly an~ ":scended stra~ht into the heavens, it augured
\veil ; but if1t hung about 1t was regarded as a bad omen.
Pordage : (See Visions.)
Porka : (See Slavs.)
Port or Fortune : (See Astrology.)
Postel, Guillaume : A visionary of the sixteenth century,
born in the diocese of Avranches. He V<"aS so precocious
that· at fourteen years of age he was made master of a
school. It is said that he was in the habit of reading the
most profound works of the Jewish rabbis, and the vivacity
of his imagination threw him into constant troubles, from
which he had the greatest difficulty in extricating himself.
He believed that he had been called by ~d to re-unite
all men under one law, either by reason or the sword. The
pope and the king of France were to be the civil and religious
heads of his new republic. He was made Almoner to a
hospital at Venice, where he came under the influence of a
woman called )!ere Jeanne, who had visions which had
turned her head. Because of his heterodox preachings,
Postel was denounced as a heretic, but latterly was regarded
as mere!}' mad. After having travelled somewhat exten·
sively in the East, and having written several works ia
which he dealt with the visions of his coadjutor, he retired
to the priory of St. :\Iartin-des-Champs at Paris, where he
died penitent in 1581.
Posthumous Letters: )lany investigators of psychic science,
members of the Society for Psychic Research and others,
have left sealed letters, whose contents are known only t~
the writer. On the death of the writer, and before the
letter shall have been opened, an attempt is made by a
medium to reveal the contents. By this means it is hoped
to prove the actuality or otherwise of spirit communication,
for, since only the writer knows what the letter contains,
it is presumed that on his death this knowledge can only
be communicated through his discarnate spirit. This
hypothesis certainly o\·erlooks the fact that the information.
might be telepathically acquired during the writer's life-
time by a stillliving person, and so con,·eyed to the medium.
As yet, however, hypotheses are premature, for no attempt
of the kind has met with striking success.
Powder or Projection : A powder '~hich assisted the alchemist
in the transmutation of base metal into pure gold. (See
Seton.)
Powder of Sympathy : .-\ remedy which, by its application.
to the weapon which had caused a v.:ound, was supposed
to cure the hurt. This method was in vogue during the-
reigns of james I. and Charles I., and its chief exponent
was a gentleman named Sir I<enelm Digby. An abstract
of his theory, contained in an address given before an
assembly of nobles and learned men at ::llontpellier in
France, may be seen in Pettigrew's Superslitiotls connected
with .\Iedicine and St~rgery. The follou•ing is the recipe
for the powder :-·· Take Roman vitriol six or eight ounces,
beat it very small in a mortar, sift it through a fine sieve
when the sun enters Leo; keep it in the heat of the sun by
day, and dry by night." This art has been treated by some
authors ";th belief, and by others with unbelie\oing wit :
\Yrenfels says :-·• If the superstitious person be wounded
by any chance, he applies the salve, not to the wound, but,
what is more effectual to the weapon by which he received
it...
Pozeone Vile : (See Slavs.)
Pratyshara : One of the initial stages of yoga practice.
Precipitation of Matter : One of the phenomena of spiritual·
ism which least admits of a rational explanation is that
known as the ·• passing of solids through solids." The
statement of the hypothetical foun.h dimension of space is
an attempt at a solution of the problem ; so also is the
theory of ·• precipitation of matter." The latter suggests
that before one sol.id body passes through another it is
resolved into its component atoms, to be precipitated in its
original form ,;hen the passage is accomplished. M.
Camille Flamrnarion found a pa-rallel to this process in the
passage of a piece of ice- a solid-through a napkin. The
ice passes through the napkin in the form of water, and
may afterwards be re-frozen. This is matter passing
Prelati 329
through matter, a solid passing through a l>Oiid, after it has
undergone a change of condition. And we are only carr}'-
ing out M. Flammarion's inference in suggesting that it is
something analogous to this process wllich occurs in all
cases of solids passing through solids.
Prelatl : (See GIIUs de Laval.)
Premonltlon : An impressiona.l warning of a future event.
Premonitions may range from vague feelings of disquiet,
suggestive of impending disaster, to actual hallucinations,
whether visual or auditory. Dreams arc frequent vehiciP.s
of premonitions, either direct or symbolical, and there are
countless instances of veridical dreams. In such cases it
is hard to say whether the warning may have come from
an external source, as spiritualists a.ver, or whether the
portended catastrophe may have resulted, in part, at
least, from auto-suggesti;m. The latter is plainly the
explanation of another form of premonition--i.e., the
predictions made b)' patients in the magnetic or medium-
istic trance with regard to their maladies. The magnetic
subject who prophesied that his malady would reach a
crisis on a certain date several weeks ahead, probably
himself attended subconsciously to the fulfilling of his
prophecy. Might not the same thing happen in" veridical"
dreams and hallucinations ? We know that a subject
obeying a post-hypnotic suggestion will weave his action
quite naturally into the surrounding circumstances, though
the very moment of its performance may have been fixed
months before. That the dreamer and hallucinated sub-
ject also might suggest and fulfil their premonitions, either
directly or by telepathic communication of the suggestion
to another agent, does not seem very far-fetched or im-
probable. Then there is, of course, coincidence. It is
impossible but that a certain p1oportion of verified premo~ti­
tions should be the result of coincidence. Possibly, also,
such impressions, whether they remain vague forebodings
or are embodied in dreams or otherwise, must at times be
subconscious inferences drawn from an actual, if obscure,
perception of existing !acts. As such, indeed, they are not
to be lightly treated. Yet very frequently premonitions
prove to be entirely groundless, even the most impressive
ones, where the warning is emphasized by a ghostly visitant.
Prenestine Lots, The : or Sortes Prenesti11aJ. A method of
divination by lots, in vogue in Italy. The letters of the
alphabet were placed in an urn which was shaken, and the
letters then turned out on the fioor; the words thus formed
were received as omens. In the East this method of
divination is still common.
Pretu (a departed ghost) : The form which the Hindus
believe the soul takes after death. This ghost inhabits
a body of the size of a man's thumb, and remains in the
keeping of Yumu, the judge of the dead. Puni~ment is
inflicted on the Pretu, whose body is enlarged tor this
purpose and is strengthened to endure sorrow. At the
end of a year the soul is delivered from this state by the
performance of the Shraddhu, alld is translated . to the
heaven of the Pitrees, where it i~ rewarded !or its good
deeds. Afterwards, in a different body, the soul en<ers its
final abode. The performance of the Shraddhu is abos-
lutely necessary to escape from the Pretu condition.
Prophecy : In an early state of society, the prophet and
shaman were probably one and the same, as is still the
case among primitive peoples. It is difficult to say whether
the offices of the prophet are more truly religious or magical.
He is usually a priest, but the ability to look into the future
and read its portents can scarcely be called a religious
attribute. In many instances prophecy is merely utter-
ances in the ecstatic condition. Vl'e know that the python-
esses attached to the oracles of ancient Greece uttered
prophetic words under the influences of natural gases or
drugs ; and when the medicine-men of most savage tribes
Prophecy
attempt to peer into the future, they usually attain a
condition of ecstasy by taking some drug, the action of
which is well known to them. But this was not always
the case ; the shaman often summoned a spirit to his aid
to discover what portents and truths lie in the future ;
but this cannot be called prophecy. Neither is divination
prophecy in the true sense of the term, as artificial aids are
employed, and it is merely by the appearance of certain
objects that the augur can pretend to predict future events-
\Ve often find prophecy disassociated from the ecstatic
condition, as for example among the prophets of Isra-el, who
occupied themselves in great measure with the calm
statement of future political events, or those priests of the
Maya Indians of Central America known as Chilan Balam,
who at stated int-ervals in the year made certain statements
regarding the period which lay immediately before them.
Is prophecy then to he regarded as a direct utterance of the
deity, taking man as his mouthpiece, or the statement of
one who seeks inspiration from the fountain of wisdom ?
Technically, both ate true of prophecy, for we find it
stated in scripture that when the deity desired to com-
municate with man he chose certain persons as his mouth-
pieces. Again individuals ·(often the same as those chosen
by God) applied to the sJ..eity for inspiration in critical
moments. Prophecy then may be the utterances of God
by the medium of the practically unconscious shaman or
seer, or the inspired utterance of that person after inspira-
tion has been sought from the deity.
In ancient Assyria the prophetic class were called
nabu, meaning " to call" or "announce,"-a name prob-
abl}' adopted from that of the god, Na-bi-u, the speaker or
proclaimer of destiny, the tablets of which he inscribed.
Among the ancient Hebrews the prophet was called nabhia.
a borrowed title probably adopted from the Canaanites.
That is not to say, however, that the Hebrew nabhiim were
indebted to the surrounding peoples for their prophetic
system, which appears to have been of a much loftier type
than that of the Canaanite peoples. Prophets appear to
have swarmed in Palestine in biblical times, and we are
told that four hundred prophets of Baal Sat at Jezebel's
table. The fact that they were prophets of this deity
would almost go to prove that they were also priests. Vo/c
find that the most celebrated prophets of Israel belonged
to the northern portion of that country, which was more
subject to the influence of the Canaanites. Later, distinct
prophetic societies were formed,-the chief reason for
whose. existence appears to have been the preservation of
nationality ; and this class appears to have absorbed the
older castes of seers and magicians, and to some extent to
have taken over their offices. Some of the later prophcts,-
Micah, for example--appear to have regarded some of tllese-
lesser seers as mere diviners, who were in reality not unlike
the prophets of Baal. With Amos may be said to have
commenced a new school of prophecy- the canonical
prophets, who were also authors and historians, and who
disclaimed all connection with mere professional prophets.
The general idea in Hebrew Palestine was that Yahveh,
or God, was in the closest possible touch with the prophets.
and that he would do nothing without revealing it to them.
The greatest importance was given to their utterances,
which more than once determined the fate of the nation_
Indeed no people has lent so close an ear to the utterance
of their prophetic clo.ss as did the Je,,.s of old times.
In ancient Greece, the prophetic class were generally
found attache<! to tl1e or:1cles, and in Rome were repre-
sented by the augurs . In Egypt the priest.s of Ra .lt
Memphis acted as prophets, as, perhaps, did those of Hekt.
Among the ancient Celts and Teutons, prophecy was fre-
quent, the prophetic agent usually placing him or herself
in the ecstatic condition. The Druids were famous practi-
Prophecy 330
tioncrs of the prophetic art, and some of their utterances
may be still extant in the so-called Prophecies of ;\lerlin.
In America, as has been stated, prophetic utterance took
pr?.ctically the same forms as in Europe and Asia. Captain
Jonathan Carver, an early traveller in Xorth America,
cites a peculiar instance where the seers of a certain tribe
stated that a famine would be ended by assistance being
sent from another tribe at a certain hour on the following
<lay. At the very moment mentioned by them a canoe
rounded a headland, bringing news of relief. A strange
story was told in the Atla11tic ,'1./onthiy some years ago by a
traveller among the Plains tribes, who stated that an
Indian medicine;-man had prophesied the coming of him·
self and his companions to his tribe two days before their
arrival among them.

A psychic is not necessarily a medium, unless he is suffi-
ciently sensitive to be controlled by disembodied spirits.
The term psychic includes the somnambule, the mag11ctic or
mesmeric subject, anyone who is in any degree sensitive.
According to one view, all men arc in some measure sus-
ceptible to spiritual influences, and to that extent deserve
the name of psychic.
Psychic Body : A spiritualistic term variously applied to an
impalpable· body which clothes the soul on the ·· great
dissolution," or to the soul itself. Sergeant Cox in his
Jllecllanism of J
llan dcclnres that the soul-quite distinct
from mind. or intelligence, which is only a function of the
brain-is composed of attenuated matter. and has the same
form as the physical body, which it permeates in every
part. From the soul radiates the psychic foroe, by means
of which all the wcmdcrs of spiritualism arc performed.
Through its agency man becomes endowed witlt telekinetic
and clairvoyant powers, and with its aid be can affect
such natural forces as gravitation. When free of the body
the soul can travel at a lightning speed, nor is it hindered
by such material objects as stone walls or closed doors.
The psycllic body is also regarded as an intermediary bcn.,..een
the physical body and the soul, a sort of envelope, more
m:tterial than the soul it.-;elf, which encloses it at death. It
is this envelope, the psychic bcdy or nerve11geist, which
becomes visible at a ml\tcrialis:~tion by attracting to itself
other and still more material particle.,. In time the psycki:;
body decays just as did the physical, and leaves the soul
free. During the trance the soul le::wcs the body, but the
vital functions arc continued by the psychic body.
Psychical Research : A term covering all scientific investiga-
tion into the obscure phenomena connected with the
so-called .. supernatural,.. undertaken with a view to their
elucidMion. Certain of these phenomena are known. all
over the world, and have remained pr,\ctically unaltered
almost since prehistoric times. Such are the phenomena
of levitation, the fire-ordeal, cryst<>-1-gazing. thought-
reading and apparitions, anrl whenever these were met with
there was seldo:n lacking the critical enquiry of 5ome
psychical researcher. not borne away on the tide of popular
credulity, but reserving some of his judgment for the
impartial investigation of the manifestations. Thus Gaule,
in his Select Cases of Conscience to11chit:g Witches and
Wifchcrnfl (London, r6~6) , says : ·· But the more prodigious
or stupendous (of the feats mentioned in the witches' con-
fessions) are effected meerly by the devill; the witch all the
wbile either in a rapt ecstasie, a charmed sleepe, or a
melancholy dreame ; and the witches' imagination, phan-
tasie, common sense, only deluded with what is now done,
or pretended.'' And a few other writers of the same period
arrived at a similar conclusion. The result of many of these
Psychical Research
medizeval records was to confirm thE\ genuineness of the
phenomena witnessed, but here and there, even in those
days, there were sceptics who refused to see in them any
supernatural significance. Poltergeist disturbances, again,
came in for a large slmre of attention and investigation, to
which, indeed, they seemed to lend themselves. The case
of the Drumm.er of Tedworth was examined by Joseph
Glanvil, and the results set forth in his Sadducisim11s
Triumpltotus, published in 1668. The Epworth Case, which
occurred in the house of John Wesley's father, called
forth many comments, as did also the Cock Lane Ghost,
the Stockwell Poltergeist and many others. The Animal
~lagnetists and their successors the ~Iesmerists may, in a
manner, be considered psychical researchers, since these
variants of hypnosis were the fruits of prolonged investiga-
tion into the phenomena which indubitably existed in
connection with the trance state. If their speculations
were wild and their enquiries failed to elicit the truth of
the matter, it was but natural, at that stage of scientific
progress, that they should be so. Aud bert! and there even
in the writings of Paracelsus and J\lesmer we find that tltey
bad glimpses of scientific truths which were in advance of
their age. foreshadowings of scientific discoveries which
were to prove the triumph of future gcllCrations. The
former, for example, states in his writings: ' ·By the
magic power of the will, a person on this side of the ocean
may make a person on the other side he:~r what is said on
this side..... The ethereal body of a mau may know what
another man thinks at a distance of Joo miles and more."
This reads uncommonly like an anticipation of telepathy,
which has attained to such remarkable prominence iq
recent years, though it is not now generaUy attributed to
" the ethereal body of a man." Such things as these would
seem to entitle many of the mesmerists and the older mystics
to the designation of " psychical researchers."
As knowledge increased and systematisea methods came
into usc these enquiries became ever more searching and
more fruitful in definite results. The introduction of
modern spiritualism in 1848 undoubtedly gave a remarkable
impetus to psychical research. The movement was so
widespread, its effects so apparent, that it was inevitable
but that some man of science should be dra"\\'11 into an
examination of the alleged phcnomenEl. Thus we find
engaged in the investigation of spiritualism Carpenter,
Faraday and De :\!organ, and on the Continent Count de
Gasp.uin, :\I. Thury and Zollner. One of the most im·
portant of individual investigators was undoubtedly
Sir William Crookes, who worked independently for some
time before the founding of the Society for Psychical
Research.
However, although much good work w.1s done by inde-
pendent students of "psychic science," as it came to be
called, and by such societies as the Dialectical Society (q.v.)
and the Psychological Society (q.v.), it was not until 1882
that a concerted and carefully-organised attempt was
made to elucidate those obscure problems which had so
long puzzled the wits of learned and si mple. In that year
was founded the Society for Psychical ReseaYch, with the
object of examining in a scientific and impartial spirit the
real:n of the supernatural. The following passage from
the Society's original prospectus, quoted by ,\1r. Podmore
in his .Vaturalisation of the Superrfalural, indicates with
sufficient clearness its aim and proposed methods.
·· It has been widely felltbal the present is an opportune
time for making an organised and sytematic attempt to
investigate that large group of debatable phenomena
designated by such terms as mesmeric, psychical, and
spiritualistic.
·• From the reconled testimony of many competent
witnesses, past and present, including observ:ltions recently
Psychical Research 331 Psychical Research
made by scientific men of eminence in various countries,
there appears to be, amid much delusion and deception, an
important body of remarkable phenomena, which are
prima facie inexplicable on any generally recognised
hypothesis, and which, if incontestably established, would
be of the highest possible v3lue.
" The task of examining such residual phenomena has
~ften been undertaken by individual effort, but never
hitherto by a scientific society organised on a sufficiently
broad basis."
The first president of the Society was Professor Henry
Sidgwick, and among later presidents were Professor
Balfour Stewi\rt, Professor \Villiam James, Sir William
Crookes, )(r. A. J. Balfour, Professor llichet and Sir Oliver
Lodge, while prominent among the original members were
Frank Podmore, F. \V. H. ~lyers, Edmund Gurney, Pro-
fessor Barrett, Rev. Stainton Moses and Mrs. Sidgwick.
Lord Rayleigh and Andrew !;ang were also early members
of the Society. Good work was done in America in con-
nection with the Society by Dr. Hodgson and Professor
Hyslop. On the continent Loml>roso, Maxwell, Camille
Flammarion, and Professor Richet-all men of the highest
standing in their respeetiv1: branches of science-con-
ducted exhaustive researches into the phenomena of
spiritualism, chiefly in connection with the Italian medium
Eusapia Palladino.
At first the members of the Society for Psychical Research
found it convenient to work in concert, but as they became
more conversant with the broad outlines of the subject, it
was judged nece;;sary for certain sections or individuals to
specialise in various branches. The original plan sketched
roughly in 188:2 grouped the phenomena. under five different
heads, each of which was placed under the direction of a
separate Committee.
1.-An examination of the nature and extent of any
influence which may be exerted by one mind upon another,
apart from any generally recognised mode of perception.
(Hon. Sec. of Committee, Professor '!.V. F. Barrett.)
2.- The study of hypnotism, and the forms of so-called
mesmeric trance, with its alleged insensibility to pain ;
clairvoyance, and other allied-phenomena. (Hon. Sec. of
Committee, Dr. G. \Vyld.)
3.- A critical revision of Reichenbach's researches with
certain organisations called "sensitive," and an inquiry
whether such organisations possess any-power of perception
beyond a highly-exalted sensibility of the recognised
sensory organs. {Hon. Sec. of Committee, Walter H.
Coffin.)
4.-A careful investigation of any reports, resting on
strong testimony, regarding apparitions at the moment of
d eath, or othen~ise, or regarding disturbances in houses
reputed to be haunted. (lion. Sec. of Committee, Hensleigh
Wedgwood.)
s.-An enquiry into the various physical phenomena
commonlycalled spiritualistic ; with an attempt to discover
their causes and general laws. (Hon. Sec., Dr. C. Lockhart
Robertson.)
Besides these there wa~ " ....vmmittee appointed to con-
sider the literature of the subject, havin~ as its honorary
secretar~es Edmund Gurney Olnd Fredenc \V. H. Myers,
who, w1th :\ir. Podmore, collected a number of historic
instances. Of the various beads, however, the first is now
generally considered the most important, and is certainly
that which has yielded the best results to investigators. In
the case of hypnotism it is largely through the exertions of
psychical researchers that it has - been admitted to the
sphere of legitimate physiology, whereas it was formerly
classed among doubtful phenomena, even at the time the
Society was founded. 'The examination of Reichenbach's
claims to having discovered a new psychic fluid or force--
odyle (q.v.)-which issued like flame from the points of a
magnet or the human fing.-r-tips, was at length abandoned,
nothing having been found to verify his conclusions which,
however, l'revious to this had been largely accepted. The
investiga.hons in connection with apparitions and haunted
houses, and with the spiritualistic phenomena, are stili
proceeding, though on the whole no definite conclusion has
been arrived at. Though the members of the Society under-
took to carry out their investigations in an entirely unbiased
sprrit, and though those members who joined the Society
originally as avowed spiritualists soon dropped out, yet
after prolonged and exhaustive rescarcli the opinion of the
various investigators often showed marked divergence. So
far from being pledged to accept a spirit, or any other
hypothesis, it was expressly stated in a note appended to
the prospectus that·· .:\lcmbersbip of this Society does not
imply the acceptance of any particular explanation of the
phenomena investigated, nor any belief as to the operation,
in the physical worlt!, of forces other than those recognised
by Physical Science." ::-l"everthcless l\lr. Myers and Sir
Oliver Lodge, to take two notable instances, found the
evidence sufficient to convince them of the operation in the
physical world of disembodied intelligences, who manifest
themselves through the organism of the "medium" or
"sensitive." !>Ir. Podmorc, on the other hand, was the
exponent of a telepathic theory. Ally phase of the" mani-
festations " which was not explicable by means of such
known p'hysiological facts as suggestion and hyperresthesia,
the so-called "subconscious whispering," exalta.tion of
memory and automatism, or the unfamiliar but presumably
natural telepathy, must, according to him, fall under the
grave suspicion of fraud. His theory of ·poltergeists, for
example, by which he regards these uncanny disturbances
as being the work of naughty children, does not admit the
intervention of a mischievous disembodied spirit. In
coincident hallucination, again, he considers telepathy a
suitable explanation, as well as in all cases of ·• personation "
by the medium. His view-one that was shared by Andrew
Lang and others-wa.'> that if telepathy were once estab·
lished the spirit hypothesis would not only be unnecessary,
but impossible of proof.
The most important of telepathic experiments were those
conducted by Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick in t889-9t. The
percipients were hypnotised by l\lr. G. A. Smith, who also
acted as agent, and the matter to be transmitted consisted
at first of numbers and later of mental pictures. The
agent and percipient were generally separated by a screen,
or were sometimes in different rooms, though the results in
the latter case were perceptibly less satisfactory. On the
whole, however, the percentage of correct guesses was fat"
above that which the doctrine of chance warranted, and the
experiments did much to encourage a belief that some
hitherto unknown mode of communication existed. More
recently the trance communication of :\irs. Piper would
seem to point to some such theory, though lllr. l\:Iyers,
Dr. Hodgson and Dr. Hyslop, who conducted a very pro-
found investigation into thOSQ communications, were in-
clined to believe that the spirits of the dead were the agencies
in this case. Telepathy cannot yet be considered as proved.
At the best it is merely a surmise, which, if it could be
established, would provide a natural explanation for much
of the so-called occult phenomena. Even its lllOSt ardent
pr_otagonists admit that its action is extremely uncertain
and experiment correspondingly difficult. Nevertheless,
each year sees an increasing body of scientific and popular
opinion favourable to the theory, so that we may hope
that the surmised mode of communication may at last be
within a reasonable distance of becoming an acknowledged
fact. The machinery of telepathy is generally supposed to
be in the fon.""l of ethereal vibrations, or " brain waves,"
Psychical Research 3:l2 Psyehologieal
acting in accordance with natural laws, though ~lr. Gerald
Balfour and others incline to an entirely metamorphosed
theory, ur~Png, e.g., that the action does not conform to
the law of 1nverse squares.
The subject of hallucinations, coincidental or otherwise,
has also been largely investigated in recent years. and has
been found to be closely connected with the question of
telepathy. Apparitions were in former times regarded as
the " doubles" or " ethereal bodies" of the persons they
represented, but they are not now considered to be other-
wise than subjective. Nevertheless the study of ·• coinci-
dental hallucinations "-i.e., hallucinatory apparitions
which coincide with the death of the person represented,
or with some other crises in his life--raises the question as
to whether the agent may not producesuch an hallucination
in the mind of the percipient by the exercise of telepathic
influence, which may be judged to be more powerful durin<>'
an emotional crisis. Now hallucinations have been show~
to be fairly common among sane people, about one person
in ten having experienced one or more. But the chances
that such an hallucination should coincide with the death
of the person it represents are about, 1 in 19,000 ; that is,
if no other factor than chance determines thetr ratio. With
a view to ascertainin9 whether coincidental hallucinations
did actually bear a htgher proportion to the total number
of hallucinations than chance would justify, the Society
for Psychital Re,·earch j:ook a census in 1889 and the three
or four years immediately following. Professor Sidgwick
and a committee of members of the Society conducted the
investigations and printed forms were distributed among
410 accredited agents of the Society, including, besides its
own members, many medical men and others belonging to
the professional classes, all of whom gave their services
without fee in the interests of science. In all some 17,000
persons were questioned, and negative as well as affirmative
answers were sent in just as they were received, the agents
being s~cially instructed to make no discrimination between
the vanous replies. Out of 8372 men 655 had had an
hallucination, and 1029 out of 8628 women-9.9% of the
total. When ample aUowance had been made for defects
of memory with regard to early hallucinations by multi-
plying the 322 recognised and definite cases by 4. it was
found that 62 coincided with a death ; but, again making
allowances, this number was reduced to 30. Thus we find
I coincidental hallucination in 43 where, there being no
causal connection we should expect I in 19,ooo. Clearly,
then, it these figures be taken, there must be some causal
connection ~etween the death and the apparition, whether
it be a spirituali~tic or telepathic theory that may be used.
Though it be true that memory plays strange tricks, yet is
it difficult to understand how persons of edut<ation and
standing could write down and attest minutes, and dated
records of events that never happened.
Apart from telepathy, which because it postulat~s the
working of a hitherto unknown natural law, takes premier
place, perhaps the roost interesting field of research is that
of automatism. Trance writings and utterances have
been known since the earliest times, wh.:n they were
attnbutcd to demoniac possession, or, sometimes, angelic
possession. By means of planchette, ouija, and spch
contrivances many people are able to write aut;>matically
and divulge information which they the,nselves were
unaware of po3sessing. But here again the phenomena
are purely subjective, and are the result of ce.rebr.1l dissocia-
tion, such as m"l.y be induced in hypno;is. ln this state
exaltation of the f!1emory may occur, and thus account for
such phenomena as the speaking in foreian tongues with
which the agent is but ill-acquainted. Oc, conceivably,
cerebral dissociation may produce a sensitiveness to
telepathic influences, as would seem apparent in the case of
Mrs. Piper, whose autom,\tic productions in writing and
speaking have supplied investigators with plentiful materiaL
of recent years, and bave done more, perhaps, than any-
thin" else to stimulate an interest in so-called spiritualistic
pbe;omena. In connection '~ith the'' physical" phenom·
ena-probably no less the result of automatism than the
" subjective," though in a different direction-the ~talian
medium Eusapia Palb.dino bas bc;:n carefully studted by
many eminent inve;tigators both in G~eat Britaina~d on the
Continent, with the result that Carotlle Flaromarton, Pro-
fessor Richet, Sir Oliver Lodge--to mention only a few-
have satisfied themo;elves with regard to the genuineness
of some of her phenomena. .
On the whole, even if psycllicat researcll has not succeeded m
demonstrating such matters as the immortality o~ t.he soul
or the possibility of communicatio~ bet~vee~ the hVlllg and
the dead, it ha~ done good work m wtdemng the field of
psycholO"Y and therapeutics and in gaining admission for
thatdoct~ineof suggestion which since the time of Bertrand
and Braid had never been openly received and acknowledged
by the medical proCession. Many of the obscure phenom-
ena attending mesmerism, nv'lgnetism, witchcraft.' polt.er-
geists, and kindred subjects have been brought mto line
with modern scientific knowledge. Little more than
thirty years has elapsed .since the Society for P.;ychical
Research was founued, and probably in time to come it will
accomplish still more, both in conducting experiments and
investigations in conne~tion with psyc!Uc phenomena, and
in educating the public tn the use of sctenbfic methods and
habits of thought in their dealings ~\·~th the" supernat~r~l."

Psychological Society, The : The Psychological Society ~me
into being in April, 1875. having as its founder and prestdent
Sergeant Cox, and numbering among its members the Rev.
William Stainton :\loses, Mr. Walter H. Coffin, and Mr.
C. C. :\lassey. The avowed aim of the Society, as s~t fo~b
111 the president's inaugural address, was the elucidation
of those spiritualistic and other pro.~lems now !Vouped
under the term " psychical research, and to. whi~h the
Society somewhat loosely attached the destgnanon of ·
psychology. To. this end ~hey p:oposed to t;oUect and
consider the ava1lable matenal bearmg on psychic phen~m­
ena. but in reality they accomplished littl_o of any pra.ct.tcal
value, as may be seen from their published ProceedJng~
(London, 1878). The president himself had not the
necessary scientific qualifications for an investigator of
such phenomena. In November, 1879, on the death of its
president, the Society came to an end. Dut though the
P sychological Society regarded thl! ~,>sychic phenomena fr~m
a more or less popular staudpomt, and cond ucted tts
investigations in a somewhat sup~rfic~al mann~r. n~verthe­
less it contained that germ of sctenttfic enqUiry m~ the
domain of psychic science which, a few Y:ears later, m the
Society for Psychical Research, was to ra~se the s~udy to a
level where it became worthy of thl! attentiOn of philosopher
and scientist. Hitherto those who were satisfied of the
genuineneso of the spiritualistic m:nvels had fur the most
part been content to accept the explanation of spirit
intervention, but the Psychological Society was the crystal-
lisation of a small body of" rationalist" opinion whic.h ha_d
existed since the days of ::'llesroer. Sergeant Cox, m his
work, The Mechanism of Ma11 states. tha~ •· spiri~" is

Psyehomancy : Divim..tion by spirits or the art of evoking
the dead. (See Neoromaney.)
Psychometry : A term used by spiritualists to denote the
faculty, supposed to be common among mediums, of read-
ing the characters, surroundings, etc. of persons by holding
in the hand small objects, such as a watch 01: ring, which
they have had in their possession. The honour of having
discovered the psychometric faculty belongs to Dr. J. R.
Buchanan, who classed it among the sciences, and g;.ve it
the name it bears. His theory is based on the belief that
everything that has ever existed, every object, scene, event,
that has occurred since the beginning of the world, has
left on the ether or astral light a trace of its being, indelible
while the world endures; and not only on the ether, but
likewise on more palpable objects, trees and stones and all
manner of things. Sounds also, and perfumes leave
impressions on their surroundings. Just as .a photograph
may be taken on a plate and remain invisible till it has
been developed, so may those psychometric" photographs "
Temain impalpable till the developing process has been
applied. And that which is to bring them to light is-
the mind of the medium. All mediums are said to possess
the psychometric faculty in a greater or less degree. One
authority, Professor William Denton, has declared that he
.:found it in one man in every ten, and four women in ten.
Dr. Buchanan's earliestexperiments, with his own students,
showed that some of them were able to distinguish the
different metals merely by holding them in thei~: hands.
On medical substances being put into their hands they
exhibited such symptoms as might have been occasioned if
the substances were swallowed. Later he found that some
among them cot1ld diagnose a patient's disea,;e simply by
holding his hand. Many persons of his acquaintance, on
pressing a letter against their forehead, couJd tell the
(;haracter and surroundings of the writer, the circumstances
under which the letter was written and other particulars.
Some very curious stories are told of fossilised bones and
teeth revealing to the sensitives the animals they represent
in the midst of their prehistoric surroundings. Professor
Denton gave to his wife and mother-in-law meteoric frag-
ments and other substances, wrapped in paper and thor-
oughly mixed to preclude the possibility of telepathy,
which caused them to sec the appropriate pictures.
Many mediums who have since practised psychometry
have become famous in their line. As has been said, the
modus is to hold in the hand or place against the forehead
some small object, such as a fragment of clothing, a letter,
or a watch, when the appropriate visions are seen. Psy-
chometrists may be entranced, but are generally in a con-
dition scarcely varying from the normal. The psychometric
pictures. printed presumably on the article to be psychome-
trised, have been likened to pictures borne in the memory,
seemingly faded, yet ready to start into vividness when the
right spring is touched. We may likewise suppose that
the rehearsal of bygone tragedies so frequently witnessed
in haunted houses, is really a psychometric picture which
at the original occurrence impressed itself on the room.
The same may be said of the sounds and perfumes which
haunt certain houses.
PsyUi: A class of persons in Ancient Italy who had the power
of charming serpents. This name is given by other writers
to the snake-charmers of Africa, and it is said that the
serpents twist round the bodie,; of these Psylli without
doing them any injllry, although the reptiles have not had
their fangs extracted or broken. In Kahira when a viper
enters a house, the charmer is sent for, and he entices it
out by the use of certain words. At other times music is
used, and it is believed that the serpents understand what
Purrah
is said to them by the snake·charmers, so obedient are they.
Purgatory of St. Patrick : (See Ireland.)
Purrab, The : A secret society of the Tulka-Susus, an African
trib&who dwell between the Sierra Leone river and Cape
mount. The Tulka consist of Jive small communities which
together form a description of republic. Each group has
its own chiefs and council, but all are under a controlling-
power which is called the Purt'ah. Each of the five com-
munities has also its own purrah, from which is formed the
great or general purrah, which holds supreme sway over the
five bodies. Before a native can join a district pun'ah, he
must be thirty years of age, and ere he can be received into
membership of the great pttrrah, he must have reached the
age of fifty. Thus the oldest members of each district
purrall are members of the head p14rrah. On desiring
admittance to the examination for the district p14rrah, the
relations of the candidate must swear w kill him if be does
not stand the test, or if he reveals the mysteries and the
secrets of the society. Froebenius says :-" In each
district belonging to a purrah there is a sacred grove to
which the candidate is conducted, and wltere he must stay
in a place assigned to him, living for several months quite
alone in a hut, whither masked persons bring him food.
He must neither speak nor leave his appointed place of
residence.
" Should he venture into the surrounding forest, he is
as good as dead.
" After several months the candidate is admitted to
stand his trial, which is said to be terrible. Recourse is
had to all the elements in order to gain satisfaction as to
his firmness and courage. We are even assured that at
these mysteries use is made of fettered lions and leopards,
that during the time of the tests and enrolment the sacred
groves echo with fearful shrieks, that here great tires are
seen at night, that formerly the lire flared up in these
mysterious woods in all directions, that every outsider who
through curiosity was tempted to stray into the woods was
mercilessly sacrificed, that foolish people who would have
penetrated into them disappeared and were never heard of
again.
" If the candidate stands all the tests, he is admitted
to the initiation. But he must first swear to keep all the
secrets and without hesitation carry out the decisions of the
purrah of his community and all the decrees of the great
head purrah. If a member of the society betrays it or
re\'olts against it, he is condemned to death, and the sen-
tence is often carried out in the bosom ofhis family. When
the criminal least expects it, a disguised, masked and armed
warrior appears and says to him :-
.. ' The great purrah sends thee death I
" At these words everybody stands back, no one dares
to offer the least resistance, and the victim is murdered.
" The Court of each district purrah consists of twenty-five
members, and from each of these separate courts five
persons are chosen, who constitute the great purrah, or
the High Court of the general association. Hence this
also consists of twenty-five persons, who elect the head
chief from their own body.
" The special purrah of each community investigates
the offences committed in its district, sits in judgment
on them, and sees that its sentences are carried out. It
makes peace between the powerful famllies, and stops
their wranglings.
" The great purrall meets only on special occasions,
and pronounces judgment on those who betray the mysteries
and secrets of the order, or on those who show themselves
disobedient to its mandates. But usually it puts an end
to the feuds that often break out between two communities
belonging te the confederacy. When these begin to fight,
after a few months of mutual hostilities, one or other of
Purrah 334 Raksbasa
the parties, when they have indicted sufficient injury on
each other, usually wants peace. The commune repairs
secretly. to the great purrah, and invites it to become the
mediator and put an rnd to the strife.
"Thereupon the gre:~.t purrah meets in a neutral dis-
trict, and when all are assembled announces to the com-
munes at war that it cannot allow men who should live
together as brothers, friends and good neighbours, to
wage war, to wa<>te each others' lands, to plunder aud bum ;
that it is time to put an end to these disorders ; that the
great purrah will inquire into the cause of the strife; that
it requires tllat this should cease and decrees that all
hostilities be fortl1,,;th arrested.
" A main feature of this arrangement is that, as soon
as the great purrali assembles to put a stop to the feud.
and until its decision is given, all the belligerents of the
two districts at war are forbidden to shed a drop of blood ;
this always carries with it the penalty of death. Hence
everybody is careful not to infringe this decree, and abstains
from all hostilities.
" The session o1 the High Court lasts one month, during
which it collects all necessary information to ascertain
which commune caused the provocation and the ruptu•e.
At the same time it summons as many of the society's
fighting-men as may be required to carry out thP, decision.
"When all the necessary particulars are brought in, and
everylhing i3 duly weighed, it settles· the question by
condemning the guilty commune to a four days' sack.
"The warriors who have to give effect to this decision
arc all chosen from the neutral districts ; they set out by
night from the place where the great purrah is assembled.
All arc disguised. the face being covered with an ugly mask,
and armed witl1 lighted torches and daggers. They divide
into bands of forty. fifty, orsixty, and all meet unexpectedly
before dawn in the dbtrict that they have to pillage, pro-
claiming with fearful shouts the decision of the High Court.
On their approach men, women, children and old people,
all take to llight, that is, take refuge in their houses, and
should anyone be found in the fields, on the highway, or in
any other place, he is either killed or carried off and no
more is ever heard of him.
" The booty obtained by such plundering is di.,;ded into
two parts, one of which is given to the injured commune,
the other to the great purra!t, which shares it with the
warriors that have executed its decree. This is the reward
for their zeal, their obedience and loyalty.
" If one of the families in a commune subject to the
purralt becomes too powerful and too formidable, the great
prtrrah meets, and nearly always condems it-ro unexpected
sack, which is carried out by mght and, as usual, by masked
and disguised me!l. Should the heads of such a dangerous
family offer any resistance, they are killed, or carried off,
and conveyed to the depths of a sacred and lonely grove-
where they arc tried by the purYah for their insubordination ;
they are seldom heard of again.
'· Such, in part, is the constitution of this extraordinary
institution. Its existence is known; the display of its
power is felt; it is dreaded ; yet the veil covering its
intentions, decisions and decrees is impenetrable, and not
till he is about to be executed does the outbw know that
he has been condemned. The power and reputation of the
p11rra,~ is immense, not only in the homeland, but also in the
surrounding districts. It is reported to be in league v,;th
the spirits (instead of the devil).
" According to the general belief the number o£ armed
men who are members ""lind at the disposal of the pl(rrah
exceeds 6,ooo. l\lorcover, the rules, the secrets and the
mysteries of this society are strictly obeyed and observed
by its numerous associated members, who understand and
recognise each other by words and signs."

Pyromanc.y, or divining by fire, has been alluded to in Extis-
picy. The presage was good when the llame was vigorous
and quickly consumed the sacrifice ; when it was clear
of all smoke, ;transparent, neither red nor dark in colour ;
when it did not crackle, but burnt silently in a pyramidal
iorm. · On the contrary. if it was difficult to kindle, if the
wind disturbed it, if it was slow to consume the viclim, the
presage was evil. Besides the sacrificial fire, the ancients
divined by observing the ftamcs of torches, and even by
throwing powdered pitch into a fire; if it caught quickly,
the omen was good. The dame of a. torch wa'S good if it
formed one point, bad if it divided into two; but three
was a better omen than one. Sickness for the healthy, and
death for the sick, was presaged by the bending o£ the
flame. and some frightful disaster by its sudden extinction.

remained throughout the earlier stages of the movements
the chief mode of communication with the spirits. Though
it was afterwards supplanted to some extent by more
elaborate and complicated phenomena, it continued, and
still continues, to occupy a place ofsome importance among
the manifestations of the s~ance-room. It is apparent from
descriptions furnished by witne;;ses t~at t~e raps v~ried
considerably both in quality and mtens1ty, bemg sometu~es
charoicte:ised as dull thuds, sometimes as clear sounds like
an electric spark, and again as deep, vibrating tones.
Doubtless the methods by which they arc produced vary
quite as much. It has been shown, in fact, that raps may
be produced by the ankle-joints. knee-.joi~ts, shoul~cr;;. and

also instances on record where specially constructed

scientific or pseudo-scientific theories advanced, such as
electricity, odyle, ectenic force, or magnetism.
Rapport : A mystical sympathetic or antipathetic connection
between two persons. It was formerly believed that for a
''itch to harm her victims, the latter must first have become
in yapporl with her, either by contact with her person, ?r
by contact with some garment she has worr~. .A certain
witch, Florence Newton, was accused of establishingrapjlof't
between herself and those she sought to bewitch by kissing
them, whereby she was able to compass their destruction.
In the practice of animal magnetism it was considered that
the only invariable and characteristic symptom of the
genuine trance was the rapport between patient and opera-
tor. The former was deaf, dumb, blind. to all .l)ave his
magnetizer, and those with whom his magnetizer placed him
in rapport. This .condition, however, still observed in
hypnotism, is referable to a perfectly natural cause. (See
Hypnotism.) The term is preserved at the present day in
Spiritualism, when it signifies a spiritual sympathy between
the" control " and the medium or any of the sitters. The
medium-or, more properly, the control- may be placed
in ¥apport with anyone who is absent or dead, merely by
handling something which has belonge-:1 to them. It is for
a similar reason that the crystal is held for a few moments
prior to the inspection by the person on whose behalf the
crystal-gazer is about to examine it.

Reincarnation is an extremely important part of Theosophical
theory, and, while it is commonly regarded as a succession
of lives, the proper aspect in which to regard it is as one
single, indivisible life, the various manifestations in the
flesh being merely small portions of the whole. The Monad,
the Divine Spark, the Ego- whose individuality remains the
same throughout the whole course of f'eincarnation-is
truly a denizen of the three higher worlds, the spiritual, the
intuitional and the ·hi!:her mental, but in order to further
its growth and the w1dening of its experience and know-
ledge, it is necessary that it should descend into the worlds
of denser matter, the lower mental, the actual and the
physical, and take back with it to the higher worlds what
it has learned in these. Since it is impossible to progress
far during one manifestation, it must return again and
again to the lower worlds. The theory which underlies
reincarnation is entirely different from that of eternal
reward and eternal punishment which underlies, say, the
teachings of Christianity. Every individual will eventually
attain perfection though some take longer to do so than
others. The laws of his progress, the laws which govern
reincarnation, are thoS!l of evolution and of karma. Evolu-
tion (q.v.) decrees that all shall attain perfection and that
by developing to the utmost their latent powers and
qualities, and each manifestation in the low"er worlds is but
one short journey nearer the goal. Those who realise this
law shorten the journey by their own efforts while those
who do not realise it and so assist its working, of course
lengthen th<> journey. Karma (q.v.) decrees that effects
good or bad, follow him who was their cause. Hence, what
a man has done in one manifestation, he must be benefited
by or suffer for in another. It may be impossible that his
actions should be immediately effective, but each is stored
up and sooner or later will bear fruit. lt may be asked
how one long life in the lower worlds should not suffice
instead of a multitude -of manifestations, but this is explic-
able by the fact thv.t the dense matter which is the vehicle
of these bodies, becomes after a time of progress, incapable
of further alteration to suit the developing monad's needs
and must accordingly be laid• aside for a new body. After
physical death, man passes first to the astral world, then
to the heaven portion of the mental world, and in this
latter world most of his time is spent except when he de-
scends into tbc denser worlds to garner fresh experience aoo
kno\-.led~e for his further development in preparation for
passage mto the still higher sphere. In the heaven wodd
these experiences and this knowledge are woven together
into the texture of his nature. In those who have not pro·
gressed far on the journeyof evolution, the manifestations

in the lower worlds are comparatively frequent, but
with passage of time and development, these manifestations
become rarer and more time is spent in the heaven world,

Rhabdomancy : From the Greek words meaning " a rod "
and "divination," is thus alluded to by Sir Thomas
Brown :-" As for the divination or decision from the
staff, it is an 'tlugurial relic, and the practice thereof is
accused by God himself: My people ask counsel of their
stocks, and their staff declareth unto them. Of this kind
was that practised by Nabuchadonosor in that Caldean
miscellany delivered by Ezekiel." In Brand's Antiquities
the following description is cited from a MS. Discourse on
Witchcraft, written by Mr. john Bell, 1705, p. 41 ; it is
derived from Theopbylact :-" They set up two staffs, and
having whispered some verses and incantations, the staffs
fell by the operation of demons. Then they considered
which way each of them fell, forward or backward, to the
right or left hand, and agreeably gave responses, having
made use of the fall of their staffs for their signs." This
is the Grecian method of Rltabdomancy, and St. Jerome
thinks it is the same that is alluded to in the above passage
of Hosea, and in Ezekiel xxi. 21, 22, where it is rendered
"arrows." Bclomancy and Rhabdomancy, in fact, have
been confounded in these two passages, and it is a question
whether in one of the methods arrows and rods or stones
were not used indifferently. The practice is said to have
passed from the Chaldeans and Scythians to the German
tribes, who used pieces from the branch of a fruit tree,
which they llUlrked with certain characters, and threw at
hazard upon a white cloth. Something like this, according
to one of the rabbis, was the practice of the Hebrews, only
instead of characters, they peeled their rods on oneside, and
drew the presage from their manner of falling. The
Scythians and the Alani used rods of the myrtle and sallow,
and as the latter chose ·• line straight wands " according
to Herodotus, it may be inferred that their method was
that of the Hebrews, or some modification of it.
Rhapsodomaney : Divini\,tion by means of opening the works
of a poet at hazard and reading the verse which first pre-
sents itself oracularly.
Rhasis (or Rasi) : An Arabian alchemist whose real name was
Mohammed-Ebn-Secharjah Abouhekr Arrasi. He was
born at Ray. in TrAk, l<horassan. about 850. In his.youth
he devoted himself to music and the lighter pastimes, and
it was not till he had passed his thirtieth year that be turned
his attention to the healing art. But having done so, he
studied it to good purpose, and speedily became a most
skilful physician. His natural goodness of heart induced
him to turn his knowledge and skill to account in order to
benefit his poorer brethren. The study of philosophy also
claimed his attention and he travelled to Syria, Eg:~--pt, and
Spain in search of knowledge.
He was exceediogly fond of experimenting io medicine
and chemistry,and was the first to mention borax, orpiment,
realgar, and other chemical compounds. The authorship
of two hundred and twcnty·six treatises is ascribed to him,
and some of these works influenced European medicine
so late as the 17th century. He firmly believed in the
transmutation of metals, and wrote a glowing treatise on
t.he subject which he presented to Emir Almansour, Prince
of Khorassan. The Emirshowed his gratitude in a practical
fashion by giving Rhasis a thousand pieces of gold, at the
same time desiring to be present during the working ofsome
of the experiments with which the volume was plentifully
illustrated. Rhasi< consented, on condition that the prince
supplied the necessary apparatus. No expense was spared
in furnishing a laboratory for the alchemistical experiments,
but unfortunately the boasted skill of the alchemist failed
him and the performance ended miserably. Rhasis, who
was now well advanced in years, was unmercifully beaten
by the angry emir, who chose the unlucky treatise to
belabour him with. This incident is said to have caused
the blindness with which the alchemist was afterwards
affiicted.
He died about 932 in the deepj!St poverty.
In his studies in chemistry he has left some results of
real value, notwithstanding the time and trouble he spent
in the pursuit of the philosopher's stone. Another theory
which he held in common with Geber and others was that
the planets influenced metallic formation under the earth's
surface.

Rinaldo des Trois Echelles : A much-dreaded French sorcerer
of the reign of Charles IX., who, at his execution, boasted
before the king that he had in France three hundred thou-
sand confederates, whom they could not thus commit to
the flames-meaning, doubtless, the demons of the Sabbath.
Ripley, George : This alchemist was bom about the middle
of the fifteenth century at Ripley, in Yorkshire, in which
county his kinsfolk appear to have been alike powerful
and numerous. Espousing holy orders, he became an
Augustinian, while subsequently he was appointed Canon
of Bridlington in his native Yorkshire, a priory which had
been founded in the time of Henry I. by Walter de Ghent.
Ripley's sacerdotal office did not prevent him travelling,
and he prosecuted empirical studies at various places on the
continent, while he even penetrated so far afield as the island
of Rhodes, where he is said to have made a large quantity
of gold for the knights of St. John of Jerusalem. Going
afterwards to Rome he was dignified by the Pope, the
result being that, when he got back to Bridlington, he
found his brethren there intensely jealous of him. It is
reported, indeed, that he even resigned his position and
retired to a priory at Boston, but this story is probably
unfounded, the likelihood being that Ripley the alchemist
has been confounded with George Ripley, a Carmelite
friar who Jived at Boston io the thirteenth century, and
wrote a biography of St. Botolph.
Ripley died in England in 1490, but his fame did not
die with him. and in fact his name continued to be familiar
for many years after his decease. He had been among the
first to popularise the chyruical writings attributed to
Raymond Lully, which first became known in England
about 1445, at which time an interest in alchemy was
increasing steadily among English scholars-the more so
becaus<:: the law against multiplying gold had lately been
repealed ; while Ripley wrote a number of le:\rned treatises
himself, notably ;'\!edulla Alchimia, The TYeatise ofMeYcury
and The Compound of Alchcmie, the last-named being
dedicated to King Edward IV. A collected edition of his
writiogs was issued at Cassel in Germany in 1649, while in
1678 an anonymous English writer published a strange
volume in London, Ripley Revived, or a•: Exposition upo;r

:Robert the Devil was son of a Dukeand Duchess of Normandy.
He was endowed with marvellous physical strenjtth, which
he used only to minister to his evil passions. Explaining
to him the cause of his wicked impulses, his mother told
him that he bad been born in answer to prayers addressed
to the devil. He now sought religious advice, and was
directed by the Pope to a hermit who ordered him to
maintain complete silence, to take his food from the mouths
of dogs, to feign madness and to provoke abu~ from
¢ommon people without attempting to retaliate. He
became court fool to the Roman Emperor and three times
delivered the city from Saracen invasions, having, in each
case, been prompted to fight by a heavenly message. The
emperor's dumb daughter was given speech in order to
identify the saviour of the city with the court fool, but he
refused his due recompense, as we11 as her hand in marriage,
and went back to the hermit, his former confessor. The.
French Romance of Robert le Diable is one of the oldest
forms of this legend.

picturesque and unique. A Dive, or giant of Mount
Caucasus. finding himself in difficulties, applied for aid to
the human race. Rocail offered his services to the giant,
and so acceptable did these prove that the Dive made his
benefactor grand vizier. For a long period he governed the
giant's realm with entire success, and reached a position of
dignity and honour. However, when he felt himself
growing old he desired to leave behind him a more lasting
monument than public respect, so he built a magnificent
palace and sepulchre. The palace he peopled with statues,
which, by the power of magic, he made to walk and talk.
and act in all ways as though they were living men, as,
indeed, all who beheld them judged' them to be. (See

Rochester Rappings : The outbreak of rappings which
occurred in Hydesville, near Rochester, N.Y., in 1848, and
which is popularly known as the Rochester Rappitlgs, is of
peculiar importance, not because of its intrinsic superiority
to any other poltergeistic disturbance, but because it
inaugurates the movement of Modern Spiritualism. Hydes-
ville is a small village in Arcadia. Wayne County, N.Y.,
and there, in 1848, there lived one John D. Fox, with his
wife and two young daughters, Margaretta, aged fifteen,
and Kate, aged twelve. Their house was a small wooden
structure previously tenanted by one Ml<;hael \Veekman,
who afterwards avowed that he had frequently been dis-
turbed by knockings and other strange sounds in the
Hydesville bouse. Towards the end of 1\!Iarch, 1848, the
Fox family were much disturbed by mysterious rappings,
and on the evening of the 31st they went to bed early,
hoping to get some undisturbed sleep. But the rappings
broke out even more vigorously than they had done on the
previous occasions, and Mrs. F&x, much alarmed and
excited when the raps manifested signs of intelligence,
decided to call in her neighbours to witness the phenomenon.
The neighbours heard the raps as distinctly as did the Foxes
themselves. \Vhen the sounds had indicated that they
were directed by some sort of intelligence it was no difficult
matter to get into communication with the unseen. Ques-
tions were asked by the" sitters " of this informal " seance"
and if the answer were in the affirmative, raps were heard,
if in the negative, the silence remained unbroken. By this
means the knocker indicated that he was a spirit, the spirit
of a pedlar who had been murdered for his money by a
former resident in the house. It also answered correctly
other questions put to it, relating to the ages of those
present and other particulars concerning persons who lived
in the neighbourhood. In the few days immediately
foilowing hundreds of people made their way to Hydesville
to witness the marvel. Fox's married son, David, who
lived about two miles from bis father's bouse, has left a
statement to the effect that the Fox family, following the
directions of the raps, which indicated that the pedlar was
buried in the cellar, had begun to dig therein early in April,
but were stopped by water. Later, however, hair, bones,
and teeth were found in the cellar. Vague rumours were
aJloat that a pedlar had visited the village one winter, had
been seen in the kitchen of the house afterwards tenanted
by the Foxes, and bad mysteriously disappeared, without
fulfilling his promise to the villagers to return next day.
But of real evidence there was not a scrap, whether for the
murder or for the existence of the pedlar, particulars of
whose life were furnished by the raps. Soon after these
happenings Kate Fox went to Auburn, and Margaretta to
Rochester, N.Y., where lived her married sister, Mrs. Fish
(formerly Mrs. Underhill), and at both places outbreaks of
rappings occurred. New mediums sprang up, circles were
formed, and soon Spiritualism was fairly started on its
career.

Rome : ~gieal practice was rife amongst the Romans.
Magic was the motive power of their worship which was
simply an organized system of magical rites for communal
ends. It was the basis of their mode of thought and out-
look upon the world, it entered into every moment and
action of their daily life, it affected their laws and customs.
This ingrained tendency instead of diminishing, developed
to an enormous extent, into a great system of superstition,
and in the later years led to a frenzy for strange gods.
borrowed from all countries. In times of misfortune and
disaster the Romans were always ready to borrow a god
if so be his favours promised more than those of their own
deities. Though there was a .strong conservative element
in the native character, though the " custom of the elders "
\\-'aS strongly upheld by the priestly fraternity, yet this
usually gave way before the will and temper of the people.
Thu$, as a rock shows its geological history by its differing
strata, so the theogony of the Roman gods tells its tale of
the race who c<>nceived it. There are pre-historic nature
deities, borrowed from the indigenous tribes, gods of the
Sabines, from whom the young colony stole its wives ;
gods of the Etruscans, of the Egyptians, Greeks ancl
Persians. The temple of Jupiter ·on the Capitol con-
tained the altar of a primitive deity, a stone-god, :rerminus,
the spirit of boundaries : in the temple of Diana of the
Grove, a fountain nymph was worshipped. Instances of
this description are numerous. .
Spirits.-In addition to the gods, there were spmts to be
propitiated. Indeed the objects offered to the Roman for
adoration were numberless. Apuleius gives a description
of this when he tells of a country road where one might meet
an altar wreathed with flowers, a cave hung with garlands,
an oak tree laden with horns of cattle, a hill marked by
Rome 338
fences as sacred. a log rough-hewn into shape, an altar of
turf smoking wit~ lib;ltions ?r a ~ton~ anointed wit!~ ?il.
E,·ery single act10n of man s d;uly ~1fe ~ad a pres1dmg
spirit; commerce and husbandry likew1se. There was
eatin<> Edoea, drinking Potina ; there were spirits of
depa;'ture, of journeying, of approach~ng and ~~me­
coming. In commerce there was l\1ercunus, the sp1nt of
gain, of money, Pecunia : in fa~ing, the ~pirits o.f cutting,
grinding, sowing and bec·keepmg. A de1ty preSided o,·er
streets and hi..hways : there was a goddess of the sewers,
Cloacina ; a 'Spirit of bad smells, )Jepbitis. Spirits of
evil must also be propitiated by pacificatory rites, such as
Robigo, the spirit of mildew ; in Rome there was &n altar
to Fever and Bad Fortune. From the country came
Silvanus, god of farms and woods, and t>is Fauns and
nymphs with Picus, the wood-pecker god who had- fed the
twins Romulus and Remus with berries-a!! .these w~re
possessed of influences and were approached with peculiar
rites. The names of these spirits were inscribed on tablets,
indigitamcnia, which were m the charge of the pontiffs,
who thus knew which spirit to evoke according to the
need. Most of these spirits were animistic in origin.
The Roman Worship consisted of magical rites destined
to propitiate the vowers controlling .m~nkind ; to b~ng
man into touch with them, to renew his life and that whiCh
supported it, the land with its trees, corn and cattle, to
stop that process of ~egener~tion constantly .set .in mo.tion
by evil influences. Everythmg connected With 1t typ1fied
this restoration. The Priests who represented the life of
the community, were therefore bound by strict observances
from endangering it in any way. Rules as to attire, eating
and touch were numerous. Sacrijites were systematised
according to the end desired and the deity in,·oked. There
were rules as to whether the victim must be young or
full-grown, male or female; oxen were to be offeret.l to
Jupiter and ulars; swlne to Juno, to Ceres the corn-
goddess and to Sih·anus. At one shrine a cow in calf was
sacrificed and the ashes of the unborn young were o f
special magical efficacy. Human sacrifice existed within
historical times. Alter the battle of Canna: the Romans
had sought to dh·ert misfortune by burying two Greeks
alive in the cattle-marl et while in the time of Julius
Cresar two men were put to death with sacrificial solemn-
ities by the Pontiff and Flamen of )Jars. Again, in the
time of Cicero and Ilorace boys were killed for magical
purposes. Fire possessed great virtue and was held sacred
in the worship of Vesta, in early belief Vesta being the
.fire itself; it presided over the family hearth : it restored
purity and conferred protection. Blood had the same
quality and smeared on the !ace of the god symbolised and
brought about the one-ness of the deity with the commun-
ity. On great occasions the Statue of Jupiter was treated
thus : the priests of Dellona made incisions in tl\eir shoul-
ders and sprinkled the blood upon the image ; the face of a
triumphant general was painted with vermilion to represent
blood. Kneeling and prostration brought one into direct
contact with the earth of the sacred place. 1\Iusic was
also used as a species of incantation, probably deriving
its origin in sound made to drive away evil spirits. Danc-
ing too was of magical efficacy. In Rome there were
colleges of dancers for the purposes of religion. youths who
danced in solemn measure about the altars, who, in the
sacred month of Mars took part in the festivals and went
throughout the city dancing and singing. One authority
states four kinds of ·• holy solemnity " ; sacrifice, sacred
banquets, public festivals and games. Theatrical per-
formances also belonged to this category, in one instance
being used as a means of diverting a pestilence. The
sacred banquets were often decreed by the Senate as thanks-
Rome
giving to the gods. Tables were spread with a sumptuous
repast in the public places and were first offered to the
statues of the deities seated around. The festivals were
numerous, all of a magical and symbolic nature. In the
spring there was the Parilia when fires of straw were
lighted, through which persons passed to be purified ; the
Cerealia, celebrated with sacrifice and offerings to Ceres,
the corn-goddess, and followed by banquets. The Lupe,--
calia, the festi,·al of Faunus, was held in February and
symbolised the wakening of Spring and growth. Goats
were slain as sacrifice and with their blood the Luperci,
youths clad in skins. smeared their faces. They took
thongs of the goat-skin and laughing wildly rushed through
the city striking the crowd. Homan matrons believing that
the blows thus received rendered them prolific; Juno,
the goddess of marriage and childbirth also had her festh·al,
the •lfatro11alia, celebrated by the women of Rome. There
were the festivals of the dead when the door leading to the
other world was opened, the stone removed from its
entrance in the Comitium, and the shades coming forth
were appeased with offerings. On these days three times
in the year, when the gods of gloom were abroad, complete
cessation from all work was decreed, no battle could be
fought nor ship set sail neither could a man marry. To
the Sacred Games were taken the statues of the gods in
gorgeous procession, chariots of silver, companies of
priests, youths singing and dancing. The gods viewed the
games reclining on couches. The Chariot ?'aces also par-
took of the nature of rites. A!ter the races in the Field
of Mars came one of the most important Roman rites, the
sacrifice of the October Horse. The right-hand horse of
the victorious team was sacrificed to )lars, and the tail
of the animal, running with blood, carried to the Altar of
the Regia. The blood was stored in the temple of Vesta
till the following spring and used in the sacrifice of the
festival of Parilia. This sacrifice was essentially magical,
all citizens present being looked upon as purified by the
blood-spnnkling and lustral bonfire. The Roman outlook
upo': life was wholly coloured by magic. Bodily foes had
their counterpart iu the unseen world, wandering spirits
of the dead, spirits of evil, the anger of innocently offended
deities, the menace of the e'·il eye. Porte:!ts and prodigies
were e,·erywhere. ln the heavens strange things might
be seen. The suo had been known to double, even treble
itself : its Lizht turn to blood, or a magical halo to appear
round the orb. Thunder and lightning were always
fraught with presage; jove was angered when he opened
the heavens and burled h1s bolts to earth. Phantoms, too,
hovered amid the clouds ; a great fleet of ships had been
seen sailing over the marshes. Upon the Campagna the
gods were observed io conflict, and afterwards tracks of the
combatants were visible across the plain. Unearthly
voices '~ere heard amid tbe mountains and groves ; cries
of portent had sounded within the tcmplc.c;. Blood haunted
the Roman imagination. Sometimes it was said to have
covered t he land as a mantle, the standing corn was dyed
with blood, the rivers and fountains flowed with it, while
walls and sta.tues were covered with a bloody sweat. The
flight and so11g ofl>irds might be foretelling the decrees of
Fate : unappeased spirits of the dead were known to lurk
near and steal away the souls of men and then they too
were ·• dead." All these happenings were attributable to
the go..ts and spirits, who, if tne portent be one of menace,
must be propitiated, if one of good fortune. thanked with
offerings. Down to the later times this deep belief in the
occurrence of prodigies persisted. When Otho set out for
Italy. Rome rang with reports of a gigantic phantom rush-
ing forth from the Temple of Juno; of the Statue of
Julius turning from east to west.
Rome 339 Rose
A ttgury.-Divination was connected with the Roman
worship. There was a spot on the Capitol from which the
augur with veiled head read the :luspices in the flight of
birds. Augurs also accompanied armies and fleets and
read the omens before an engagement was entered upon.
Di!linatiol! was also practised by reading the intestines of
antmals, by dreams, by divine possession as in the case of
the Oracles when prophecies were uttereu. Tllese had
been gathered together in the Sibylline books (q.v.), and
were consulted as oracles by the State. With the wvrsbip
of F~rtune were connected the Lots of Prce1:este. The
queshons put to the goddess were answered by means of
oaken lots which a boy drew from a case made of sacred
wood. The fortune-tellers also used a narrow-necked urn
which, filled with water, only allowed one lot at a time to
rise. AstYologers from Chaldea were also much sought
after and were attached t.o the kingly and noblt i.ouses.
Familiar things of everyday life were of magical import.
Words , Numbers, odd ones specially for the Kalends,
Nones and Ides were so arranged as to faU upon odd days;
touch was binding and so recognised in the law of Rome, as
the grasp of a thing sold, from a slave to a turf of distant
esta.te; and lmotti11g and twisting of thread was injurious
so.tnat women must never pass by cornfields twisting their
spmdles, they must not even be uncovered. There was a
strange sympathy between the tYees and mankind, and
great honour was paid to the sacred trees of Rome. On
th~ oak tree of Jupiter the triumpllant general hung the
shteld and arms of his fallen foe; while the hedges about
the Temple of Diana at Nemi were covered with votive
offerings. The trees also harboured the spirits of the dead
who came forth as dreams to the souls of men. Pliny the
elder says in this matter ·• Trees have a soul since nothing
on earth lives without one. They are the temples of
spirits and the simple countryside dedicates still a noble
tree to some god. The various kinds of trees are sacred to
their protecting spirits: the oak to Jupiter, the laurel to
Apollo, olive to Minerva, myrtle to Venus, white poplar to
Hercules." These trees therefore partook of the nature of
their presiding spirits and it was desirable to bring about
communion with their magical influence, as in the spring
when laurel boughs were hung at the doors of the flamens
and pontiffs and in the temple of Vesta where they re-
mained hanging till the following year. Trees and their
leaves were also possessed of healing and purifying value;
laurel was used for the latter q~ality as in the Roman
triumphs the fasces of tile commander, the spears and
javelins of legionaries were wreathed with its bratiches to
purify them from the blood of the enemy. Ma" himself
had a presiding spirit, his genius, each woman her" juno "
the Saturnalia was really a holiday for this " other self."
The Roman kept his birthday in honour of his genius, offer-
ing frankincense, cakes and unmixed wine oa an altar
garlanded with flowers and making solemn prayers for the
coming year. City and village had their genii, also bodies
of men from the senate to the scullions.
Death was believed to be the life and soul enticed away by
revengeful ghosts, hence death would never occur save
by such agencies. The dead therefore must be appeased
with offerings or else they wander abroad working evil
among the living. This belief is present in Ovid's lines :
" Once upon a lime the great feast of the dead was not
observed and the manes failed to receive the customary
gifts, the fruit, the salt, the corn steeped in unmixed wine,
the violets. The injured spirits revenged themselves
on the living and the city was encircled with the funeral
:fires of their victims. The townsfolk heard their grand-
sires complaining in the quiet hours of the night, and told
each other how the unsubstantial troop of monstrous
spectres rising from their tombs, shrieked along the city
streets and up and down the ftelds." Beans were used in
the funeral feasts. They were supposed to harbour the
souls of the dead, and the beau-blossom to be inscribed
with characters of mourning.
Dreams were considered of great importance by the
Romans; many historical instances of prophetic dreams
may be found. They were thought to be like birds, the
'' bronze-coloured" hawks; they were also thought to be
the souls of human beings visiting others in their sleep ;
also the souls of the dead returning to earth. Jn Virgil
much may be found on this subject; Lucretius tried to
find a scientific reason for them ; Cicero, though writing in
a slighting manner of the prevalent belief in these mani-
festations of sleep, yet records dreams of his own, which
events proved true.
Sorcery in all its forms, love-magic and death-magic was
rife amongst all classes, besides necromantic practices.
There were charms and spells for C'Verything under the
sun ; the rain-charm of the pontiffs consisting of the
throwing of puppets into the Tiber; the charm against
thunder-bolts compounded of onions, hair and sprats; the
charm against an epidemic when the matrons of Rome
swept the temple-floors with their hair ; and many more
down to the simple love-charm strung round the neck of
the country maiden.
Witches were prevalent. The poets often chose these
sinister figures for their subjects, as when Horace describes
the ghastly rites· of two witches in the cemetery of the
Esquiline. Under the light of the new moon they crawl
about looking for poisonous herbs and bones ; they call the
spectres to a banquet consisting of a black lamb torn to
pieces with their teeth, and after, these phantoms must
answer the questions of the sorceresses. They make
images of their victims and pray to the infernal powers for
help ; hounds and snakes glide over the ground, the moon
turns to blood, and as the images are melted so the lives of
the victims ebb away. Virgil gives a picture of a sorceress
performing love-magic by means of a waxen image of the
youth whose love she desired. Lucan in his Pharsalia
treats of Thessaly, ri'Otorious in all ages for sorcery aud
draws a terrific figure--Erichtho, a sorceress of illimitable
powers, one whom even the gods obeyed, to whom the
forces of earth and hea,·en were bond-slaves; and Fate
waiting her least command. Both Nero and Agrippina
his mother were reported to have had recourse to the
infamous arts of sorcery; while in the 1::\ew Testament may
be found testimony as to these practices in Rome. The
attitude of the cultured class towards magic is illustrated
by an illuminating passage to be found in the writings of
Pliny the elder. He says " The art of magic has prevailed
in most ages and in most parts of the globe. Let no one
wonder that it has wielded very great authority inasmuch
as it embraces three other sources of influence. No one
doubts that it took its rise in medicine and sought to cloak
itself in the garb of a science more profound and holy than
the common run. It added to its tempting promises the
force of religion, after which the human race is groping,
especially at this time. Further it has brought in the
arts "of astrology and divination. For everyone desires
to know what is to come to him and believes that certainty
can be gained by consulting the stars. Having in this way
taken captive the feelings of mao by a triple chain it has
reached such a pitch that it rules over all the world and in
the East, governs the King of Kings." K. N.
Romer, Dr. C. : (See Spiritualism.)
Rose : From the earliest times the Yose has been an emblem
of silence. Eros, in the Greek mythology, presents a rose
to the god of silence, and to this day sub rosa, or " under
the yose," means the keeping of a secret. Roses were used
in very early times as a potent ingredient in love pbilters.
Rosen, Paul 3!0
In Greece it was customary to leave bequests !or the main-
tenance of rose gardens, a custom wbich bas come down to
recent times. Rose gardens were common during the
middle ages. According to Indian mythology, one of the
wives of Vishnu was found in a rose. In Rome it was the
custom to bless the rose on a certain Sunday, cai!E;d Rose
Sunday. The custom of blessing the golden rose came
into vogue about the eleventh century. The golden rose
thus consecrated '~as given to princes ali a mark of the
Roman Pontiffs' favour. In the east it is still believed
that the first rose was generated by a te-.lr of the prophet
:\fohammt:d, and it is further believed that on a certain
day in the year the rose has a heart of gold. In the west
of Scotland if a white rose bloomed in autumn it was a
token of an early marriage. The red rose, it was said,
would not bloom over a grave. If a young girl had several
lovers, and wished to know which of them would be her
husband, sbc would take a rose leaf for each of her sweet-
hearts, and naming each leaf after the name of one of ber
lovers, she would watch them till one after another they
sank, and the last to sink would be her future husband.
Rose leaves thrown upon a fire gave good luck. If a rose
bush were pruned on St. John's eve, it would bloom again
in the autumn. Superstitions respecting the rose are
more numerous io England than in Scotland.

Rosicrucians : The idea of ~ Rosicruci.
·m Brotherhood has
probJ.bly aroused more interest in the popular mind than
that of any other secret society of kindred nature: but
that such a brotherhood ever existed is extremely doubt-
ful. The very name of Rosicrucian seems to have exercised
a spell upon people of an imaginative nature for nearly
two hundred and fifty yei\rs, and a great deal of romantic
fiction has clustered around the fraternity: such as for
example Lord Lytton's romance of Zanoni ; Shelley's
no-.-d St. lrilyne the Rosicrucia11, Harrison Ainsworth's
Auriol, and similar works.
The name Rosicrucian is utilised by mystics to some
extent as the equivalent of magas. but in its more specific
application it was the title of a member of a suppositions
society which arose in the late sixteenth century. There
are several theories reg:\rdmg the derivation of the name.
The most commonly accepted appears to be that it was
derived from the appellation of the supposed founder,
Christian Roscnkreuze; but as his history has been proved
to be wholly fabulous, this theory must fall to the ground.
Mosheim, the historian, gave it as his opinion that the name
was formed from the L:\tin words ros, dew, crux a cross ·
on the assumption that the alchemical dew of the philoso~
phers w..ts the most powerful dissolvent of gold, while the
cross was equivalent to light. It is more probable that the
name Rosicrucian is derived from rosa a·rose, and crux a
cro3s, and we find tho:~t the general symbol of the supposed
order was a rose crucified in the centre of a cross. In an
old Rosicrucia11 book of the last centurv, we further find
the symbol of a red cross-marked heart in the centre of an
open rose, which )lr. A. E. \Vaite belie"es to be a de"elop-
ment of the monogram of :.!artin Luther,· which was a
cro~-crowned he~rt rising from the centre of an open rose.
Ht~lory of lire Supposed Brotherhood.- Practically nothing
defirute was known concerning the Rosicrucian Brother-
hood before the publication of ::\[r. \Vaite's work The real
Rosicrucians
History oj the Rosicf'ucians tn 1887. Prior to that a great
deal had been written concerning the fraternity, and
shortly before Mr. Waite produced his well-known book
another had made its appearance under the title of The
RosicrucialiS, their Rites and Mysteries by the late Mr.
Hargrave Jennings. This book was merely a farrago
of the wildest absurdities, rendered laughable by the
ridicu~ous ~ttitude of tne author, who pretended to the
guardiansbtp of abysmal occult secrets. It was typical
of most writings regarding the fraternity of the Rosy
Cross, and as the Westminster Review wittily remarked in its
notice C1f tlte volume, it deals with practically e~·erything
under the sun except the Rosicrucians. :llr. 'Waite's work
the result of arduous personal research, bas gathered
togc:ther. all that ~'\n possibly be known regarding the
!?ostcnutatrs, and. hts facts arc ~rawn from manuscripts,
m some cases dtscovercd by htmself, and from skilful
analo~y. As it is the only authority on the subject worth
speaking about, we shall attempt to outline its conclusions.
We find then that the name " Rosicrucian·:, was un-
known previously to the year 1598. The history of the
movement originates in Germany, where in the town of
~asset in the year ~614 the profcss~rs of magic and mystic-
tSm, the theosophtsts and alchemtsts, were surprised by
the publication of a pamphlet bearing the title Tire Fama
of the Fraternity of lire Meritorious Order of the Rosy Cross
Addressed lo the Learned in General and lhe Governors of
Europe. It purported to be a message from certain anony-
mous adepts who were deeply concerned for the condition
of mankind, and wbo greatly desired its moral renewal
and perfection. It proposed that all men of learning
throttghout the world should join forces for the estab-
lishment of a synthesis of science, through which would be
discovered the perfect method of all the arts. The squab-
bungs and quarrellings of the literati of the period were to be
forgone, and the antiquated authorities of the elder world
to be discredited. It pointed out that a reformation had
taken place in religion, that tbe church had been cleansed,
and that a similar new career was open to science. All this
was to be brought about by the assistance of the illuminated
Brotherhood,-the children of light who had been initiated
in the mysteries of the Grand Orient, and would lead the
age to perfection.
The fraternity kindly supplied an account of its history.
The head and front of the movement was one C.R.C. of
Teutonic race, a magical hierophant of the highest rank,
who in the fifth year of his age had been placed in a con-
vent, where he learned the Humanities. At the age of
fifteen, he accompanied one, Brother P. A. L. on his travels
to the Holy Land ; but the brother died at Cyprus to the
great grief of C. RC., who, however resolved to undertake
the arduous journey himself. Arriving at Damascus, be
there obtained knowledge of a secret circle of thcosopbists
who dwelt in an unknown city of Arabia called Damcar,
who were expert in all magical arts. Tuming aside from
his quest of the Holy Sepulchre, the lad made up his mind
to trace these illuminati and sought out certain Arabians
who carried him to the city of Damcar. There he arrived
at the age of sixteen years, and was graciously welcomed
by the magi, who intimated to him that they had long
been expecting him, and relating to him several passages
in his past life. They proceeded to initiate him into the
mysteries of occult science, and he speedily became
acqu;-.inted with Arabic, from which tongue he translated
the divine book :II into Latin. After three years of mrstic
instruction, he departed from the mysterious city for
Egypt, whence he s.1ilcd to Fez as the wise men of Damcar
had instructed him to do. There he fell in with other
masters who taught him bow to e,·oke the elemental
spirits. After a further two years' sojourn at Fez, his
Roslcruelans 341
period of initiation was over, and he proceeded to S_Pain _
to
confer with the wisdom of that country, and conv_
mce 1ts
professors of the errors of their ways. U~hap~1ly, the
scholarhood of Spain turned its back u_
pon h1m w1th loud
laughter, and intimated to him that 1t had !came~ the
princil>les and practice of the black art from a ~uch h1gher
authority, namely Satan himself, who had unve1led !O th~m
the secrets of necromancy within the walls of the un1vers1ty
of Salamanca. With noble indignation he shook the dust
of Spain from his feet. and turned his face ~o ~ther C?untnes
only, alas, to find the same treatment w1thm the•r boun-
daries. At last he sought his native land of Gern~any ~here
he pored over the great truths he h~d learned. m sohtude
and seclusion and reduced his umvcrsal ph1losophy to
writing. Fiv~ years of a hermit's life, however. only
served to strengthen him in his opinions. and he cou~d not
but feel that one who had achieved the transmutat1?n of
metals and had manufactured the elixir of life was des1gned
for a nobler purpose than rumination in solitude. Slowly
and carefully he began to coUect around him assistants who
became the nucleus of the Rosicrcuian fraternity. When
he had gathered four of these person_
s into the brother_hood
they invented amongst them a mag-Jcal language•.a c1pher
writing of equal magical potency, and a large diCtionary
replete with occult wisdom. They erected a House of the
Holy Ghost, healed the sick, and initiated further mem~crs.
and then betook themselves as missionaries to the vanous
countries of Europe to disseminate their w~sdom. In
course of time their founder. C.R.C.• breathed Jus ~ast. a~d
for a hundred and twenty years the secret. of h1s_ bunal
place was concealed. The original members also d1ed one
by one, and it was not until the third generation of adepts
had arisen that the tomb of their illustrious founder was
unearthed during the re-building of one of their secret
dwellings. The vault in which this.tomb ~as f?und ~-:as
illuminated by the sun of the mag1, a_
nd m~cnbed \\lth
magical characters. The body of t_he 1Liustnous founder
was discovered in perfect preservat1on, and a nu.mber of
marvels were discovered buried beside him, winch con-
vinced the existing members of the fraternity that it was
their d·uty to make these publicly known to the world. It
was this discovery which immediately inspire~ the brother-
hood to make its existence public in the c1rcular above
alluded to, and they im·ited all worthy persons to apply to
them for initiation. They refused. however, to supply
their names and addresses, and desired that those who
wished for initiation could signify their intention by t~e
publication of printed letters which they would ~e certam
to notice. ln conclusion they assured the pubbc of the
circumstance that they were believers in the reformed
Church of Christ, and denounced in the most solemn
manner aiL pseudo-occultists and alchemists.
This Fama created tremendous excitement among the
occultists of Europe, and a large number of pa~nphlets w~re
published criticising and defending the soCiety and 1ts
manifesto, in which it was pointed out there were a number
of discrepancies. To begin with no such cit~ as Damcar
existed within the bounds of Arabia. Where, 1t was asked.
was the House of the Holy Ghost, which the Rosicmcians
stated had been seen by 10o,ooo persons and was yet con-
cealed from the world ? C.R.C.• the founder, as a boy of
filteen must have achieved great occult skill to have
astonished the magi of Damcar. But despite these objec-
tions considerable credit was given to the Rosicrucian
publication. After a lapse of a year appeared the Con-
fessiOII of the Rosicrucian. Fratemity, addressed to the
learneu in Europe. This offered initiation by gradual
stages to selected applicants. and discovered its ultra-
Protestant character by what an old Scots divine was wont
Rosicrucians
to calL a " dig at the Pope," whom it publicly execrated,
expressing the pious hope that his " asinine braying"
would finally be put a stop to by tearing him to pieces
with nails I In the followmg year, 1616, The Chymical
Nuptials of Christian Rosencreutz was published, purporting
to be incidents in the life of the mysterious founder of the
Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross. But the chymical marriage
makes Christian Hosencreutz an old man when he achieved
initiation, and this hardly squu.res with the original account
of his life as given in the Fama. By this time a number
of persons had applied for initiation, but had received no
answer to their application. As many of these believed
themselves to be alchemical and magical adepts, great
irritation arose among the brotherhood, and it was generally
considered that the whole business was a hoax. By t62o,
the Rosicrucians and their publication had lapsed into
absolute obscurity.
Numerous theories have been put forward as to the
probable authorship of these manifestoes, and it has been
generally considered that the theologian Andrea:: produced
them as a kind of laborious jest ; but this view is open to so
many objections that it may be dismissed summarily.
Their authorship has also b~en claimed for Taulerus,
Joachim JUnge, and lEgidius Guttmann; but the individ-
ual in whose imagination originated the Brotherhood of the
Rosy Cross will probably for ever remain unknown. It is
however, unlikely that the manifesto was of the nature of a
hoax, because it bears upon its surface the marks of intense
earnestness, and the desire for philosophical and spiritual
reformation ; and it is not unlikely that it sprang from
some mystic of the Lutheran school who desired the co-
operation of like-minded persons. Mr. Waite thinks there
is fair presumptive evidence to show that some corporate
body such as the Hosicrucian Brotherhood did exist : but
as he states that the documents which are the basis of this
belief give evidence also that the association did not
originate as it pretended. and was devoid of the powers
which it claimed, this hypothesis seems in the highest
degree unlikely. Such a document would more probably
emanate from one individual, and it is almost impossible
to conceive that a body of men professing such aims and
objects as the manifesto lays claim to could possibly have
lent themselves to such a farrago of absurdity as the history
of C.R.C. A great many writers have credited the brother-
hood with immense antiquity; but as the publisher of the
manifesto places its origin so late as the fifteenth century,
there is little necessity to take these theories into con-
sideration.
So far as can be gleaned from their publications. the
Rosicrucians, or the person in whose imagination they
existed, were believers in the doctrines of Paracels~s. They
believed in alchemy, astrology and occult forces 1n nature
and their credence in these is identical with the doctrines
of the great master of modern magic. They were thus
essentially modern in their theosophical beliefs, just as
they were modern in their religious ideas. Mr. Waite
thinks it possible that in Nuremburg in ~he year 1598_ a
Rosicrucian Society was founded by a myst1c and alchem1st
named Simon Studion, under the title of Militia Crucifera
Evang~Jlica, which held periodical meetings in that city.
Its proceedings arc reported in an unprinted work of
Studion's, and in opinions and objects it was identical with
the supposed Rosicrucian Society. '· Evidently," he
says, ·• the Rosicrucian Society of 1614 w3ls a transfi~ura­
tion or development of the sect established by S1mon
Studion.'' Dut there is no good eviuence for this state-
ment. After a lapse of ne.1rly a century, the RoHcn4cians
reappeared in Germany. In 17Io,acertain Sinccrus Racatus
or Sigmund Richter, published A Perfect and Trtte Prepara-
tion of the Philosophical Stone according to the S~Jcret Methods
Rosicrucians 3-!2 Rossetd
of tJUJ Brotherhood ofthe GoldeII aild Rosy Cross, and annexed
to this treatise were the rul~s of the Ro~icrucian Society
for the initiation of new members. Mr. Waite is of opioion
that t,hese rules arc equivalent to a proof of the society's
existence at the period, and that they help to establish the
important fact that it still held its meetings at Nuremburg,
where it was originally established by Studion. In 1785,
the publication of Tile Seu~t Symbols of the Rosicrucians
of tl~e Sixteenth and Sevent!enth Centuries took place at
Altona, showing in Mr. Waite's opinion that the mysterious
brotherhood so11 existed ; but this was their last manifesto.
These things are certainly of the nature of proof, but they
are so scanty that any re~sonable and workable hypothesis
that such a society ever existed can scarcely be founded
upon them. For all we know to the contrary they may
be publications of enthusiastic and slightly unbalanced
pseudo-mystics, and nothing definite can be gleaned from
their existence.
In t6t8 Henrichus Neubuseus published a Latin pamph-
let, which stated that the Rosicrucian adepts bad
migrated to India, and present-day Theosophists will have
it that they exist now in the table-lands of Tibet. It is
this sort of thing which altogether discredits occultism
in the eyes of the public. Without the slightest shadow of
proof of any kind, such statementsare wildly disseminated ;
and it has even been alleged that the Rosicrucians have
developed into a Tibetan Brotherhood, and have exchanged
Protestant Christianity for esoteric Buddhism ! :11r.
Waite humorously states that he has not been able to
trace the eastern progress of the Brotherhood further than
the Isle of :Vla.uritius, where it is related in a curious manu-
script a ce~ain Comte De ~bazal initiated a Dr. Sigismund
Bacstrom mto the mystenes of the Rose Cross Order in
1794; but we know nothing about the Comte de Chazal or
hi~ character, and it is just possible that Dr. Bacstrom
mtght have been one of those deluded persons who in all
times ~nd countries have been ;_villiIIi to purchase pro-
blematical hono~rs. . From the J·ama and Confessio, we
glea.n sot?e defimte tdeas of ~he occult conceptions of the
Rostcruetans. In these documents we find the doctrine of
the Microc:os~.us (q.v.), whi~h cc;>nsiders man as containing
the pote?tiahti~ of the whole umverse. This is a distinctly
Paracelstau belief. \Ve also find the belief of the doctrine
of. Eleme~t~l Spirits .(q.v.), which. ma~y people wrongly
thmk ongmated . Wlth the Ros1cruetans ; but which
was probably retntroduced by Paracelsus. We also
fmd that the manifestoes contain the doctrine of the
Signatura Rewm, which also is of Paracelsian ori!!in. This
is tb~ magical writing referred to in the Fama 7and the
mysttc characters of that book of nature,.which, according
to the Confessio, stand open for all eyes, but can be read or
understood by only the very few. These characters are
the seatof God imprinted on the wonderful work of creation,
on the heavens and e;trth, and on all beasts. It would
appear too, that some form of practical magic was known
to the Brothe.rhood. They were ~lso, according to them·
sdves, alchemtsts, for they had achieved the transmutation
of metals and the manufacture of the elixir of life.
In England th~ ~osicmcian idea was taken up by Fludd,
who wrote a spmted defence of the Brotherhood : by
Vaughan who translated the Fama and the Confessio;
and ~y Joh~ Heydon, who furnished a peculiarly quaint
and mterestlng account of the Rosicrucians in The Wise
.\Ian's .crown: and further tre.'\tises regarding their alchemi-
cal sktll and medical ability in El Ilavarevna or The
Engl!sh Phys!tian's Tut:>r, a!ld A New !\letllod' of Rosie
Cruc1an Physltk, London 1<158. In France Rosicrucianism
ra:1 a like course. It has been stated by Buhle and others
that there was much connection between the Rosicrucians
and Freemasons.
A pseudo-Rosicrucian Society existed in England before
the year 1836, and this was remodelled about the middle of
last century under the title " The Rosicrucian Society of
England." To join this it is necessary to be a Mason. Tile
officers of the society consist of three magi, a master-
general for the first and second orders, a deputy master-
general, a treasurer, a secretary and seven ancients. The
assisting officers nurnber a precentor. organist, torch-
bearer, herald, and so forth. The society is composed of
nine grades or classes. It published a little quarterly
magazine from 1868 to 1879, which in an early number
stated that the .oociety was " calculated to meet the re-
quirements of those worthy masons who wished to study
the science and antiquities of the craft, and trace it through
its successive developments to the present time ; also to
cull information from all the records extant from those
mysterious societies which had their existence in the dark
ages of the world, when might meant right." These
objects were, however, fulfilled in a very perfunctory
manner, if the magazine of the association is any criterion
of its work. For this publication is filled with occult
seriaL stories, reports o! mo:!.Sonic meetings and verse. .Mr.
Waite states that the most notable circumstance con·
nected with this society is the complete ignorance which
seems to have prevailed among its members generally
concerning everything connected ·with Rosicrucianism.
The prime movers of the association were Robert Went-
worth Little, Frederick Hockley, Kenneth Mackenzie and
Hargrave Jennings, and in the year 1872 they seem to have
become conscious that their society had not borne out its
original intention. By this time the Yorkshire College
and East of Scotland College at Edinburgh, had been
founded-one docs not know "'oi.th what results. " This
harmless association," says )ir. W2.ite, " deserves a mild
sympathy at the hands of the student of occultism. Its
character," be continues, ·• could hardly have deceived the
most credulous of its postulants. Some of its members
wrapped themselves in darkness and mystery, proclaimed
themselves Ros1crucians with intent to deceive. These
persons found a few-very few-believers and admirers.
Others assert thz.t the society is a cloak to something else-
the last resource of cornered credulity and exposed impos-
ture. There are similar associations in other parts of
Europe, and also in America: e.g., the Sociekzs Ros1cruciana
of Boston." But in the CO!lduding pages of 1\lr. Waite's
book we find the following pa.sso:.ge: " On the faith of a
follower of Honnes, I can pro:nise that nothing shall i:lc
held back from .these true Sons of the Doctrine, the sincere
seekers after hgbt, who are. empowered to preach the
supreme Arcana of the psychic world with a. cleaa heart and
an earnest aim. True Rosi~rucians and true alchemical
adepts, if thcTe be a!ly in existe~ce at this day, will not
resent a new procedure when Circumstances have been
radicall>·. ch:1.nged." )!r. \Vaite appeal::; to these students
of occulttsm wno are men of method as well of irua"ina:ic•n
to assist him in clearing away the dust and rubbish whkh
have accumulated durins centuries of oblivion in the silent
sanctuaries of the transcendental sciences that the tra·
ditional secrets of u.ature may shine forth i~ the darkness
of doubt and uncertainty to illumlllate the straight ano.i
narrow aveilues which communicate between the seen a.ml
the unseen.
Rossetti, Dante Gabriel : English Author and Painter (tSz3-
188z). Gabriel Charles Dante Rosset!i, poet, po:.inter and
translator, and commonly known as Da11te Gabriel Ros~etti
was born in London in 1828, his father being an lt2.:l<:!.~
who had settled in England. While yet a boy Ros•etti
m~niiested <esthetic leanings, and accordingly he was sent
to study drawing under no less distinguished a preceptor
than Cotman, while shortly afterwards he entered the
Round 343
R?yal Academ;; .s chools. Then in 18-18. feeling Ute aced of
sttll further tmtton, he commenced working at the studio

show lwnself a patnter of. distinct iudhiduality, while
stmultaneously h~ madts l.us first essays in translating
ltab~n hterature mto EngliSh, a.nd became known :.mong
hiS fnends as a poet of rare promtse. Meanwhile however
Rosset:i was really more interested in the brush than in th~
pen. and soon after finally quitting Brown's studio he

suggests that he was a man of gentle birth, while it is com-
monly supposed that he was a French monk of the order of
St. Francis, ancl it is reported that in 1357, presumably on
account of his alchemistic predilections. he was imprisoned
by Pope Innocent VI. Rupecissa contributed four volumes
to the literature of hermetic philosophy : Coelum Pliiloso-
pho71tm, Paris 1543, De Qui11la Esse11tia Rerm11 Oumiam,
Basle 1561, De Secret:s Alchemia, Cologne 1579, Liz.:re de
Lumihe, Paris. n.d.; and these were admired by a number
of the ?.uthor's successors, but their value is really literary
rather than scientific.
Leavtng Ius fathers house tn 1849, Rossetti went to live
at Chatham.Pla~, ~lackfriars Bridge, and duting the next
teo years Ins acttvtty as a painter was enormous · while
the ~ear 18~o is a no,table one in his career, marked as it is
by. ht.s marnage to E leanor Siddal. The love between the
pa1r was of an exceptionally passionate order and from it
sprang Rossetti's immortal sonnet-seqttence called The
!fouse of Life, published in 1881 ; but Mrs. Rossetti died
In 1862, and thereupon the poet, terribly cast down by his
bereavement, weut to hve at a house in Chelsea with
Swinburne and Meredith. Here he continued to write
fitfully, while in 1871 he completed one of his most famous
picture~, Daut.e's Dream ; yet the loss of his wife preyed
upon him persistently, he was torhJTed by insomnia, and in
consequence ~~e began to take occasional doses of chloral.
Gradually th1s pracuce developed into a habit sapping
alike the phy~ical and mental strength of the p~et ; a nd
thou.gh he rallied f~r a while d\tring a stay in Scotland, where
he. h ved at P?nkill Castle in Ayrshire, it soon became
ev1dent that Ius death was imminent unless be eschewed
his d~ug. . Bu~ he had.not. the strength of will necessary
lor tbts abjuration, he dted 1n 188z at .Brrchiogton and his
remains were interred in the cemetery there. '
Rossetti had a marked bias for mysticism in various
forms. William Bell Scott, in his Autobiography, tells how
the poet became a t one time much enamoured of table-
turning and the like; while waiving his somewhat childish
t~t~ herein, his temperament was undoubtedly a very
religtous one, and once towards the close of his life he
declared that he had " seen and heard those that died
long ago_." . Was. 1t, then, a belief in the possibility of
commumcahng wtth the dead which induced him, on his
wiie"s death, to have some of his love poems enclosed in the
coffin of the deceased ? while, be the answer to tills question
~vha! it may! Rossetti's mysti.cism certainly bore good fruit
m his art, hts Rose J.\1/ary bemg among the most beautiful
of English poems introducing the supernatural element.
Nevertheles~. it is by his painting rather than by his poetry
that Rossettt holds a pla..:e as a great mystic; for, despite
h1s fondness for precise handHng, all his pictures with the
exception of Fozmd are essentially of a mystical nature ;
they are not concerned with the tangible and visible world,
but body forth the scenes ancl incidents beheld in dreams
and do this with a mastery reflected by no other kindred
works save those of Blake.

Russia seems to have been endowed with the beauty of
person and the gentle characteristics of the ;\[ermaids of
Nort hern nations. Shy and benevolent, she lived on ~he
small allu,rial islands that stud the mighty rivers which
drain this extensive and thinly-peopled country. or in the
detached coppices that fringe their banks, in bowers wo:-en
of flowering reeds and green-willow-boughs ; her pasti~e
and occupation being to aid in secret the poor fishermen m
their laborious and precarious calling. Little is known of
these beautiful (:reatures-as if the mystery and secrecy
which was inculcated and enforced in all affairs of govern-
ment in this country had been extended to its fair¥ faith.
Even Keightley, so learned in fairy lore, kn<;>ws h~tle of

water, and wring their locks on the green meads at the

appear ; and the people then, singing and dancmg. weave
garlands for them. which they cast into the stream."
Russia ; (For early history of occult matter:; in Russi.a see
Slavs.) Spiritualism was first introduced mto .Russ1a .by
persons who had become interested in the subJect wbil~t
abroad through witnessing manifestations of psychiC
phenomena and acqu?.intance with the works of Allan
Kardec, the French exponent of Spiritualism.. From the
first the new doctrine found its followers chiefly among
members of the professions and the aristocracy, finally
including the reigning monarch of that time, Alexander IL
with many of his family and entourage as devoted adher-
ents. Because of the immense influence of such converts
the progress of Spiritul\lism in Russia was made smoother
than it otherwise would have been in a country where the
laws of Church and State are nothing if not despotic. and
d isposed to look upon anything new in m attet'S rehg1ous,
intellectual or merely of general interest as partab"ll;l~ of a
revolutionary character. Even so, much of the spmtual-
istic propaganda, manifestations and publications were
prosecuted under various ruses and subterfuges such as the
circulation of n paper entitled " The Rebus." profess_edJy
devoted to innocent rebuses and charades and onJy 10~1
-
dentally mentioning Spiritualism the real object of 1ts
being. Chief amongst the distinguished devotees of the
subject was Prince \:Vittgenstein, aide-de-camp an? trus.ted
friend of Alexander 11., who not only avowed h1S ?ehefs
openly but arranged for variO\lS mediums to give seances
before the Emperor, one of these being the w~ll:kno~n
D. D. Home. So impressed was the Czar that, It 1s sa1~,
from that time onwards he consulted mediums and the1r
prophetic powers as to the advisability or otherwise of
any contemplated change or step in his life. doubtless
helped or driven to such dependence on mediums by ~he
uncertain conditions under which occupants of the Russ1an
throne seem to exist.
"Another Russian of high position socially and officiallY,
:M. Aksakvf, interested himself in the matter in ways many
Ruysbroeek 34:4 Saint ~rmain
and various, arranging seances to which he invited the
scientific men of the University, editing a paper Psychische
Stt4dien, of necessity published abroad; translating Sweden-
borg's works into Russian beside various French, American
and English works on the same subject and thus becoming a
leader in the movement. Later, with his friends, .M. 1\1.
Boutlerof and Wagner, professors respectively of chemistry
and zoology at the University of St. Petersburg, he specially
commenced a series of seances for the investigation of the
phenomena in an experimental manner and a scientific
committee was formed under the leadership of Professor
Mendleyef who afterwards issued an adverse report on the
matter, accusing the mediums of trickeryand their followers
of easy credulity and the usual warfare proceeded between
the scientific investigators and spiritual enthusiasts."
M. Aksa.kofs commission was reported upon unfavourably
by ::\1. ::lfendeleyef, but the· former protested against the
report.
At the other extreme of the Social scale among the
peasantry and uneducated classes generally, the grossest
superstition exists, an ineradicable belief in supernatural
agencies and cases arc often reported in the columns of
Russian Papers of wonder-working, obsession and various
miraculous happenings, all ascribed, according to their
character, to demoniac or angelic influence, or in the
districts where the inhabitants are still pagan to local
deities and witchcraft.
Ruysbroeck or Ruysbrock: Flemish Mystic (1293-1381). It
is prob:1ble that this mystic derived his name from the
village of Ruysbreck, ncar Brussels, for it was there that
be was born 1n the year 1293. Even as a child he showed
distinct religious leanings, and before he was out of his teens
he had steeped himself in a wealth of mystical literature.
Naturally,. then, he decided to espouse the clerical pro-
fession. and in 1317 be was duly ordained, while a little
later he became vicar of St. Gudule. one of the parishes of
Brussels. During his long term of acting in this capacity he
became widely esteemed for his erudition, and for his
personal piety ; while his sermons and even his letters were
passed from hand to hand. and perused with great admira-
tion by many of his fellow clerics. But he was never found
guilty of courting fame or publicity of any kind, 2nd at the
age ot sixty he retired to Groenendale, not far from the
battlefield of Waterloo, where he founded a monastery.
There he lived until bis death in 1381, devoting himself
chiefly to the study of mysticism, yet showing himself any-
thing but averse to those charitable actions befitting a.
monk.
Ruysbroeck was known to his disciples as " the ecstatic
teacher." As a thinker he was speculative and broad-
minded, and indeed he was one of those who prefigured the
Reformation, the result being that, though he won the·
encomiums of many famous theologians in the age immedi-
ately succeeding his, an attempt to beatify him was sternly
suppressed. lie was a tolerably voluminous writer, and at
Cologne, in 1552, one of his manuscripts found its way into·
book form with the title, De Napeu svel de Omatu Nupti~rt~m
Spiritualium; while since then a number of his further
works bavc been published, notably De Vera Contemplatione
and De Septem Gradivus Amoris (Hanover, 1848). The
central tenet of his teaching is that ''the soul finds God in
its own depths," but, in contradistmction to many other
mystics, he did not teach tbe fusion of the self in God, but
held that at the summit of the ascent towards righteousness
the soul still preserves its identity.
Ruysbroeck and his teaching begot many voluminous
commentaries throughout the middle ages, and he bas
attracted a number of great writers, the Abbe Bossuct, for
example, and at a later date Maurice Macterlinck. In 1891
the latter published L'Oruema11t des Noces SpiritueUes, de
Ruysbroeck l'admirable, and an English translation of thi~
by J. T. Stoddart was issued in t904· The reader desirous

Saba : In Ossianic legend, wife of Finn and mother of Oisin.
In the form of a fawn, she was captured by Finn in the
chase, but noticing that his man-hounds would do her no
hurt, he gave her shelter in his Dun of Allen. The next
morning he found her transformed into a beautiful woman.
She told him that an enchanter had compelled her to assume
the shape of a fawn, but that her original form would be
restored if she reached Dun Allen. Finn made her his
wife, and ceased for a while from battle and the chase.
Hearing one day, however, that the Northmcn's warships
were in the Bay of Dublin, he mustered his men and went to
fight them. He returned victorious, but to find Saba gone.
Tbe enchanter, taking advantage of his absence, had
appeared to her in the likeness of Finn with his hounds and
so lured her from the dun, wben she became a fawn again.
Sabbatbl : To this ang£1, in the Jewish rabbinical legend of

He receives the divine light of the Holy Spirit, and com-
municates it to the dwellers in his kingdom.
Sabellicus, Georgius : A magician who lived about the same
time as Faustus of Wittenberg, about the end of the r5th
century. His chief claims to fame as a sorcerer rest on his
own wide and arrogant advertisement of his skill in necro-
mancy. He styles himself, "The most accomplished
GeOYgius Sabellicus, a second Faustus, the spring and centre
?f nc~romantic art, a:n astrologer, a magician, consummate
m chiromancy, and 1n agromancy, pyromancy and hydro-
mancy inferior to none that ever lived." Unfortunately,
no proof is forthcoming that he ever substantiated these
bombastic claims, or was ever regarded by anyone else as
anything but a charlatan.

Saint Germain, Comte de: Born probably about 1710, one
of the most celebrated mystic adventurers of modern.
times. Like Cagliostro and others of his lrind almost
nothing i!} known concerning his origin, but there is reason
to believe that he was a Portuguese Jew. There arc,
however, hints that he was of royal birth, but these have
never been substantiated. One thing is fairly certain, and
that is that he was an accomplished spy, for he resided at
many European Courts, spoke several languages fluently,
and was even sent upon diplomatic missions by Louis XV.
He had always abundance of funds at his command, and is
alluded to by Grimm as the most capable and able man
he had ever known. He pretended to have lived for
centuries, to have known· Solomon, the Queen of Sheba
and many other persons of antiquity; but although
obviously a charlatan, tbe accomplishments upon which he
based his reputation were in many ways real and con-
siderable. Especially was this the case as regards chcm·
istry, a science in which he was certainly an adept, and he
pretended to have a secret for removing the fia·ws from
diamonds, and to be able to transmute metals, and of
course he possessed the secret of the elixir of life. He is
mentioned by Horace Walpole as being in London about
Saint Germain 345 St. Martin
1743, and as being arrested as a Jacobite spy, who was later
released. Walpole writes of him : " He is called an
Italian, a Spaniard, a Pole, a somebody who married a
great fortune in Mexico and ran away with her jewels to
Constantinople, a priest, a fiddler, a vast nobleman."
Five years after his London experience, he attached himself
to the court of Louis XV. where he exercised considerable
influence, over that monarch, and was employed by him
upon several secret missions. He was distinctly the fashion
about. this time, for Euro~e was greatly inclined to the
purswt of the occult at thts epoch ; and as he combined
mystical conversation with a pleasing character,and not a
little flippancy, he was the rage. But he ruined his chances
at the French court by interfering in a dispute between
Austria and France, and was forced to remove himself to
England. .He resided in London for one or two years, but
we trace him to St. Petersburg, 1762, where he is said to
have assisted in the conspiracy which placed Catherine TJ.
on the Russian throne. After this he travelled in Germany
where be is said in the Memoirs of Cagliostro to have become
the founder of freemasonry, and to have initiated Cagliostro
into that rite. (See Cagliostro.) If Cagliostro's account
can be credited, he set about the business with remarkable
splendour, and not a little bombast, posing as a " deity,"
and behaving in a manner calculated to gladden pseudo-
mystics of the age. He was nothing if not theatrical, and
it is probably for this reason that he attracted the Land-
grave Charles of Hesse, who set aside a residence for the
study of the occult sciences. He died at Schleswig some-
where between the years 1780 and 1785, but the exact date
of his -death and its circumstances are unknown. It would
be a matter of real difficulty to say whether he possessed
any genuine occult power whatsoever, and in all likelihood
he was merely one of those charlatans in whom his age
abounded. Against this view might be set the circum-
stance that a great many really clever and able people of
his own time thoroughly believed in him ; but we must
remember the credulous nature of the age in which he
flourished. It has been said that XVIII. century Europe
was sceptical regarding everything save occultism and its
professors, and it would appear to unbiassed minds that
this circumstance could have no better illustration than
the career of the Cot~e de Sait~t Germait~.
A notable circumstance regarding him was th.at he
possessed a magnificent collection of precious stones, which
some consider to be artificial, but which others better
able to judge believe to have been genuine. Thus he
presented Louis XV. with a diamond worth 10,000 livres.
All sorts of stories were in circulation concerning him.
One old lady professed to have encountered him at Venice
fifty years befOre, where he posed as a man of 6o, and even
his valet was supposed to have discovered the secret of
immortality. On one occasion a visitor rallied this man
upon his master being present at the marriage of Cana in
Galilee, asking him if it were the case. "You forget, sir,"
was the reply, " I have only been in the Comte's service a
century."

Saint Jacques, Albert de : A monk of the seventeenth cen-

St. John's Crystal Gold : " In regard of the Ashes of Veget-
ables," says Vaughan, "although their weaker exterior
Elements expire by violence of the fire, yet their Earth
cannot be destroyed, but is Vitrified. The Fusion and

R adical! moysture or Seminal water of the Compound.
This wat~r resists the fury of the fire, and cannot possibly

In hac Aqua ' (saith the learned Sever-
IDe), 1
Rosa latet in Hieme.' These two principles are

D~olutions. When death hatb done her worst, there is a.
Unton between these two, and out of them shall God raise
us to the last d:!:Y· and restore us to a spiritual constitution.
I do. not conce~ve there shall be a Resurrection of every

Crystal Col~. a fundamental of the New Jerusalem-so
called, not tn respect of Colour, but constitution. Their
Spirits, I suppose, shall be reduced to their first Limbus, a
sphere of pure, ethereal fire, like rich Eternal Tapestry

St. J ohn's Wort: St. John's Wort. In classical mythology
the sum:ner solstice was a day dedicated to the sun, and
was beheved to be a day on which witches held their
festivities. St. Joht~'s Wort was their symbolical plant,
and people were wont to judge from it whether their
~uture would be lucky or unlucky ; as it grew they read in
tts progressive .character their future lot. The Christians
dedicated this festive period to St. John's Worl or root, and
it became a talisman against evil. In one of the old
romantic ballads a young lady falls in love with a demon,
who tells her-
" Gin you wish to be Ieman mine
Lay aside theSe. John's Wort and the vervain."
When hung up on St. John's day together with a cross
over the doors of houses it kept out the devil and other
evil spirits. To gather the root on St. John's day morning
at sunrise, and retain it in the house, gave luck to the
family in their undertakings, especially in those begun on
that day.
St. Martin, Louls Claude de : French Mystic and Author,
commonly kno·wn as "le philosophe inconnu." (1743-
18o3). The name of Louis de St. Marlin is a familiar one,
more familiar, perhaps, than that of almost any other
French mystic; and this is partly due to his having been a
voluminous author, and partly to his being virtually the
founder of a sect, " the Martinistes " ; while again, St.
Beuve wrote about him in his Causeries du Lundi, and this
has naturally brought him under wide notice.
Born in 1734 at ·Amboise, St. Marti" came of a family of
some wealth and of gentle birth. His mother died while
be was a child, but this proved anything but unfortunat~
for him ; for his step-mother besides Iavishing a wealth of
affection on him, early discerned his rare intellectual gifts,
and made every effort to nurture them. " C'est a elle,"
he wrote afterwards in manhood, "que je dois peut·~tre
tout mon bonheur, puisque c'est elle que m'a donne les
premiers elements de cette education douce, attentive et
pieuse, qui m'a fait aimer de Dieu et des hommes." The
boy was educated at the Coll~ge de Pontlevoy, where he
read with interest numerous books of a mystical order, one-
which impressed him particularly being Abbadie"s Art de
se cont~attre soi-mtme ; and at first he intended to make
law his profession, but he soon decided on a military career
instead, and accordingly entered the army. A little before
taking t his step he had affiliated himselfwith the freemasollS'
and, on his regiment being sent to garrison Bordeaux, he
became intimate with certain new rites which the Portu-
guese Jew, Martinez Pasqually (q.v.), bad lately introduced
into the masonic lodge there. For a while St. Martin was
deeply interested, not just in the aforesaid but in the
philosophy of Pasqually ; yet anon he declared that the-
latter's disciples were inclined to be too materialistic, and
St. Martin 346 Sanyojanas
soon he was deep in the writings o! Swedenborg, in whom
he found a counsellor more to h1s taste. The inevitable
result o! studies of this nature was that he began to feel a
great distaste for regimental life, and .so, in l771, he rcs}gn~d
his commission, determining to devote the r<!St of .h~s hfe
to philosophical speculations. He now began wnting a
book Des Erreurs el de Ia I'eriti , ou l~s Hommes rappcles a"
Principe de Ia Scimce, which wd.S published in 1775. at
Edinburgh, at this time on the eve of becoming a c.entre of
literary activity of all sortS; and it is worth recalling that
this pristine effort by St. ,lfartiu was brought under the
notice of Voltaire, the old cynic observing shrewdly that
half a dozen folio volumes might well be devoted to the
topic of erre11rs, but that a page would suffice for the treat-
ment of verite 1
The young author's next important step was to pay a
visit to England, and thence in 178J he went to Italy along
with Prince Galitzin, with whom he had lately become
friendly. They stayed together for some time at Ro~e,
and then St. :llarti11 left for Strassburg, his intent1on be1ng
to study German there, for he had recently grown interested
in the teaching of ]acol;> Ba:hmc, and he was anx10~s to
study the subject thoroughly. Very soon he had ach1eved
this end, and at a later date, indeed, he translated a num~er
of the German mystic's writings into French; but meanwhile
returning to France, he found his outlooksuddenly changed,
the revolution breaking out in I 789, and a reign of terror
setting in. No one was safe, and St. ~~Iarti1z was arrested
at Paris, simply on account of his being a gentlema.n l?Y
birth; but his affiliation with the !reemasons stood him tn
good stead in this hour of need, and he w.LS liberated by a
decree of the ninth Thermidor. Accordingly he resumed
activity with his pen, and in 1792 he issued a ne:v ~ok,
Nouvel Homme ; while two years later he was comm1sstoned
to go to his native Amboise, inspect the archives and
libraries of the monasteries in that region, and draw up
occasional reports on the subject. Shortly afterwards ~e
was appointed an eUve professeur at the Ecole ?:Jormale ~n
Paris, in consequence of wnich he now made hiS home m
that town ; and among others with whom he became
acquainted there was Chateaubriand, of whose writing,
he was an enthusiastic devotee, but who, on his parts
.appears to have received the mystic ";th his usual haughty
coldness. St. .llartin did not lack a large circle of admirers,
howenr and he continued to work bard, publlshiug in
1795 o:1~ of his most important books, Lettres c~ un Ami,
ou Consid4rations politiques, plliloJSOphiques et reiigiettses
sur la Revol:.tio>z, whicl:l was succeeded in 18oo by two
speculative treatises, Ecce Homo and L'Esprit des Choses.
Then, in r8o2, be issued yet another volume, Ministere de
l'Homme Esprit; but in the following year his labours were
brought to an abrupt close, for while staying at Annay, not
far from Paris, with a friend called Lenoir-Laroche, he
succumbed to an apopleptic seizure. After his death it
was found that he had left a considerable mass o£ manu-
scripts behind him, and some of these were issued by his
executors in 1807, while in x86z a collection of his letters
appeared.
St. Marti11 was never married, but he appears to have
exercised a most extraordinary fascination over women ;
and in fact divers scandalous stories are told in this relation,
some of them implicating various courtly dames of the
French nobility of the Empire. As a philosopher St.
Martin found a host of disciples among his contemporaries,
these gradually forming themselves almost into a distinct
sect, and, as observed before, acquiring the name of·· Mar-
tinistes." \'\That, then, was the teaching of their leader ?
and what the nature of the tenets promulgated in his
voluminous writings ? It is difficult to give an epitome in
so limited a space as that at disposal here, but turning to
the author's I'Homme du Desir (1790), and again to his
Tableau uatural des Rapp'JYtS qui existent entre Die, et
/'Homme et I'Univers (1782), we find this pair tolerably
representative of all his writi:tg, and their key-note may
certainly be defined as consisting in aspiration. Man is
di\'ine desoite the fall recounted in the Scriptures, dormant
within him lies a lofty quality of which he is too often
scarcely conscious, and it is incumbent on him to develop
this quality, striving thereafter without ceasing, and
waiving the wi1ile everything pertaining to the category
of materialism- such is the salient principle in St. Jfartin's
teaching, a principle which seems literally trite nowada:ys,
for it has been propounded b}' a host of modem mystics,
notably A.E. in Tire H~ro ill )Jan. In writing in this wise,
the French mystic undoubtedly owed a good deal to
Swendenboq;. while obligations to Bcehme are of course
manifest throughout his l:l.ter works ; ~nd, while his debt
to i.\lartinez Pasqually has probably been exaggerated some-
what, there is no doubt that the Portuguese jew influenced
him greatly !or a while, the latter's teaching coming to him
at a time when he was still very young and susceptible, and
fresh Irom readings of Abbadie.

Salagrama, The : .An Indian stone, credited with possessill:g
ma"ical properties, and worn as an amulet. Th1s stone IS
bla~k in colour, about the size of a billiard ball, and pierced
with holes. It is said that it can only be found in the
Gandaki, a river in ~cpaul, which some believe rises at the
foot of Vishnu, and others in the head o£ Siva. It is ke?t
in a clean cloth, and often washed and perfumed by 1ts
fortunate owner. The water in which it has been dipped is
supposed thereby to gain sin-expelling potency, and is
therefore drunk and greatly valued. It possesses other
occult powers, and is. a necess~ry ingredient ~f the .Pt:e-

Salamander's Feather : Otherwise known as Asbestos. A
mineral of an mcombustible nature, which resembles flax,
beino of fine fibrous texture. It was used by the Pagans to
lighttheir temples: when once it was lighted, they believed
it could not be put out, even by rain and storms. Leonar-

Saphy : Perhaps from the Arabie safi " pure, select, excellent."
Certain charms or amulets worn by the negroes as pro-
-cection against thunderbolts and diseases, to procure them
wives, and avert disasters of aU kinds. They are com-
posed of strips of paper on which sentences from the Koran
are inscribed, sometimes intermixed with kabalistic sigt~s.
These strips are enclosed in silver tubes or silk bags, which
are worn near the skin, and often fastened in the dress.
Africans of both sexes and all religions are great believers
in the occult properties of such talismans; and Mungo
Park resorted to the making of Saphy, or Grigris (as they
are some times called), as a means of earning his living.
Sapphire : It is understoo<l to make the melancholy cheerful
and maintain the power or manly vigour of the body. The
high priest of Egypt wore a sapphire upon his shoulder,
and Aelian says that it was called truth. The Buddhists
still ascribe a sacred magical power to it, and hold that it
reconciles man to God. It is a good amulet against fear,
promotes the flow of the animal spirits, hindereth ague and
gout, promotes chastity, and prevents the eyes from being
affected by small-pox.

Sardlus : This gem resembles the cornelian, and is an antidote
to the onyx. It prevents unpleasant dreams, makes its
possessor wealthy, and sharpens the wit.
Sardou, VIctorian : The famous French dramatist was a keen
student of occultism, and studied spiritualism with Allan
Kardec (q.v.). He achieved great facility as a medium for

are of great merit artistically as well as from an occult point
of view. Some of them are reproduced in M. Camille
Flamrnarion's book Mysterious Psychic Forces. (See

Sat :B'Kal: A Hindu society, the object of which was the
study and development of Indian philosophy. It was so
called after the bird Malacocersis Grisis, which .ilolways flies
by sevens. It was introduced into England about the year
1872 by Major J. H. Lawrence Archer. It had seven
descending degrees, each of seven disciples, and seven
ascending degrees of perfection, Ekata or Unity. It
ceased to be necessary on the establishmentof the Theosoph-
ical Society.

Wilchcrajt.-!n mcdi<eval times Scandinavian examples
of witchcraft arc rare, but in 1669 and 1670 a great out-
break of fanaticism against it commenced in Sweden in the
district of Elfdale.
The villages of Mobra and Elfdale are situated in the dales
of the mountainous districts of the central parts of Sweden.
In the first of the years above mentioned, a strange report
went abroad that the children of the neighbourhood were
carried away nightly to a place they called Blockula, where
they were received by Satan in person ; and the children
themselves, who were the autbors of the report, pointed out
to them numerous women, who, they said were witches and
carried them thither. The alarm and terror in the district
Scandinavia
became so great that a report was at last made to the king,
who nominated commissioners, partly clergy and partly
laymen, to inquire into the extraordinary circumstances
which had been brought under his notice, and these com-
missioners arrived in Mohra and announced their intentions
of opening their proceedings on the 13th of August, 167o.
On the x-zth of August, the commissioners met at the
parsonage-bouse, and heard the complaints of the minister
and several people of the better class, who told them of the
miserable condition they were in, and prayed that by some
means or other they might be delivered from the calamity.
They gravely told the commissioners that by the help of
witches some hundreds of their children had been drawn
to Satan, who had been seen to go in a visible 'shape through
the country, an<l to appear daily to the people ; the
poorer sort of them, they said, he had seduced by feasting
them with meat and drink.
The commissioners entered upon their duties on t~e
next day with the utmost diligence, and the result of the1r
misguided zeal formed one of the.most rema~kable examples
of cruel and remorseless persecution that stams the annals of
sorcery. No less than threescore and ten in)labitants of
the village and district of Mohra, three-and-twenty of whom
made confessions, were condemned and executed. One
woman pleaded that she was with child, and the rest
denied their guilt and these were sent to Fahluna, where
most of them ,;ere afterwards put to death. Fifteen
children were among tltose who suffer~d death•. and thirty-
six more, of different ages between rune and stxteen, were
forced to run the gauntlet, and be scourged on th~ bands at
the church-door every Sunday for one year ; whtle twenty
more, who had been drawn into these practices more
unwillingly, and were very young, were condemned to .be
scourged with rods upon their hands for three succesSlve
Sundays at the church-door. The number of the children
accused was about three hundred.
It appears that the commissioners began by taking the
confessions of the children, and then they confronted them
with the witches whom the children accused as their
seducers. The latter to use the words of the authorised
report, having " most of them children with them, which
they had either seduced or attempted to seduce, some
seven years of age, nay, fro~ four t?, sixteen years:: now
appeared before the commiSSloners.. Some of.the ~ldren
complained lamentably of the m1sery and ffilschief they
were forced sometimes to suffer of the devil and the
witches." Being asked! whether they were su.re, that they
were at any time carne<i away by the dev1.l ? they all
replied in the affirmative. " Hereup~n the Witches ~hem­
selves were asked, whether the confesstons of those chtldren
were true and admonished to confess the truth, that they
might tu;n away from the <levi! unto the living God. .At
first, most of them did very stiffly, and .withou~ sh~ddmg
the least tear, deny it, though much.agamst theu w1ll and
inclination. After this the 'children were examined every
one by themselves, to see whether their confessions did
agree or no, and the commissioners found that all of the!ll',
except some very little ones, which .could not tell ~11 the
circumstances, did punctually agree m thetr .co~fesstons of
particulars. In the meanwhile, the comffiiSStoners that
were of the clergy examined the witc~es,_ but could n?t
bring them to any confession, all contmutrl:g steadfast m
their denials till at last some of them burst mto tears, and
their contess'ion agreed with what the children said ; and
these expressed their abhorrence of the fact, and begged
pardon. Adding that the devil, whom they called Locyta,
had stopped the mouths of some of them, so loath was he
to part with his prey, and bad stopped the ears of others.
And being now gone from them, they could no longer
Scandinavia 34R
conceal it; for they had now perce1ved his treachery."
The witches asserted that, the journey to Blockula was
not always made with the same kind of conveyance ; they
commonly used men, beasts, even spits and posts, accord-
ing as they had opportunity. They preferred. however,
riding upon goats, and if they had more children with them
than the animal could conveniently carry, they elongated
its back by means of a spit anointed with their magical
ointment. It was further stated, that if the children did
at any time name the names of those, either man or woman,
that had been with them, and had carried them away, they
were again carried by force, either to Blockula or the c.ross-
w·
ay, and there beaten, insomuch that some of them died of
it; ·• and this some of the witches confessed, and added,
that now they were exceedin~ly troubled and tortured in
their minds for it." One thmg was wanting to con.firm
this circumstance of their confession. The marks of the
whip could not be found on the.persons of the victims,
except on one boy, who had some wounds and holes in his
back, that were given him with thorns; but the witches
said they would quickly vanish.
The account they gave of Blockula was, that it was
situated in a large meadow, like a plain sea, " wherein you
can see no end." The house they met at had a great gate
painted with many divers colours. Through this gate they
went into a little meadow distinct !rom the other, and here
they ·turned their animals to graze. When they had made
use of men for their beasts of burden, they set them up
against the wall in a state of helpless slumber, and there
they remained till wanted for the homew.ud flight. In a
very large room of this house, stood a long table, at which
the witches sat down ; and adjoining to this room was
another chamber, where there were " lovely and delicate
beds."
As soon as they arrived at Blockula, the visitor;; were
required to deny their baptism, and devote themselves
body and soul to Satan, whom they promised to serve
f.\ithfully. Hereupon be cut their fingers, and they wrote
their name with blood in his book. He then caused them
to b~ b.1ptizcd anew, by priests appointed for that purpose.
Upon th1s the devil gave them a puu~. wherein there were
filings of clocks, with a big stone tied to it, which they
threw into the water, and said, "As these filings of the
clock do never return to the clock, from which they were
taken, so may my soul never return to heaven ! " Another
difficulty arose in verifying this statement, that few of the
children had any marks on their fingers to show where they
had been cut. But here again the story was helped by a
girl who had her finger much hurt, and who declared, that
because she would not stretch out her finger, the de'l.oil in
anger had thus wounded it.
When these ceremonies were completed, the witches sat
down at the table, those whom the fiend esteemed most
being placed nearest to him ; but the children were made
to stand at the door, where he himself gave them meat and
drink. Perhaps we may look for the origin of this part of
the story in the pages of Pierre de Lancre. The food with
which the visitors to Blockula were regaled, consisted of
broth, with coleworts and bacon in it; oatmeal bread
spread with butter, milk and cheese. Sometimes they
said, it tasted very well, and sometimes very ill. After
meals they went to dancing, and it was one peculiarity of
these northern witches' sabbaths, that the dance was
usually followed by fighting. Those of Elfdale confessed
that the devil used to play upon a harp before them.
Another peculiarity of these northern witches was, that
children resulted from their intercourse with Satan, and
these children having married together became the parents
of toads and serpents.
The witches of Sweden appear to have been less noxious
Scandinavia.
than those of most other countries, for, whatever they
aeknowledgeu themselves, there seems to have been no
evidence of mischief done by them. They confessed that
they were obliged to promise Satan that they would do all
kinds of mischief, and that the devil taught them to milk,
which was after this manner. They used to stick a knife
in the wall, and hang a kind of label on it, which they drew
and stroaked ; and as long as this lasted, the persons they
had power over were miserably plagued, and the beasts were
milked that way, till sometimes they died of it. A woman
confessed that the devil gave her a wooden knife, where-
with, going into houses, she had power to kill an)rthing she
touched with it ; yet there were few that could conless
that they had hurt any man or woman. Being asked
whether they had murdered any children, they confessed
that they bad indeed tormented many, but did not know
whether any of them died of these plagues, although they
said that the devil had showed them several places where
he had power to do mischief. The minister of Elfdale
declared, that one night these witches were, to his thinking,
on the crown of his head. and that from thence he had a
long continued pain of the head. And upon this one of the
witches confessed that the devil had sent her to torment that
minister, and that she was ordered to use a nail, and strike
it into his head, but hiss kull was so hard that the nail would
not pcntrate it, and merely produced that headache. The
hard-headed minister said further, that one night be felt
a pain as if he were torn with an instrument used for
combing flax, and when he awoke he heard somebody
scratching and scraping at the window, but could see
nobodv; and one of the witches confessed, that she was the
person that had thus disturbed him. The mi11ister of
Mohra declared also, that one night one of these witches
came into his house, and did so violently take him by the
throat, that be thought be should have been choked, and
awaking, he saw the person th.at did it, but could not know
her ; and that for some weeks he was not able to speak, or
perform divine service. An old woman of Elfdale confessed
that the devil had helped her to make a nail, which she
stuck into a boy's knee, of which stroke the boy remained
lame a long time. And she added, that, before she was
burned or executed by the hand of justice, the boy would
recover.
Another circumstance confessed by these witches was,
that the devil gave them a beast, about the shape and
bigness of a cat, which they called a carrier ; and a bird
as big as a raven, but white ; and these they could send
anywhere, and wherever they came they took away all
sorts of victuals, such as butter, cheese, milk, bacon, and all
sort> o£ seeds, and carried them to the witch. What the
bird brought they kept for themselves, but what the carrier
brought they took to Blockula, where the arch-fiend gave
them as much of it as he thought good. The carriers, t hey
said, filled themselves so full oftentimes, that they were
forccnto disgorge it by the way, and what they thus rendered
fell to the ground, and is found in several gardens where
coleworts grow, and far from the houses of the witches. It
was of a yellow colour like gold, and was called witches'
butter.
Such arc the details, as far as they can now be obtained,
of this extraordinary delusion, the only one of a similar
kind that we know to have occurred in the northern part
of Europe during the ·' age of witchcraft." In other
countries we can generally trace some particular cause
which gave rise to gr~t persecutions of this kind, but
her~. as the story is told, we see none, for it is hardly likely
that such a strange series of accusati11ns should have been
the mere inv >luntary creation of a party oi little children.
Suspicion is excited by the peculiar part which the two
clergymen of Elfdalc and Mohra acted in it, that they were
Scandinavia 349 Scotland
not altogether strangen; to the fabrication. They seem to
have been weak superstitious men, and perhaps they had
been reading the witchcraft books of the south till they
imagined the country r')und them to be over-run with these
noxious beings. The proceedings at Mohra caused so much
a.larm throughout Swcd!!n, that prayen; were ordered in all
the churches for delivery from the snares of Satan, who
was believed to have been let loose in that kingdom. On
a sudden a new edict of the king put a stop to the whole
process, and the matter was brought to a close ~:tther
mysteriously. It is said that the witch prosecution was
increasing so much in intensity, that accusations began to
be made against people of a higher class in society, and
then a complaint was made to the king, and they were
stopped.
Perhaps the two clergymen themselves became alarmed,
but one thing seems certain, that the moment the com-
mission was revoked, and the pen;ecution ceased, no more
witches were heard of.
Spiritualism.-In 1843 an epidemic of preaching occurred
in Southern Sweden, which provides Ennemoser, with
material for an interesting passage in his History of Magic.
The manifestation of this was so similar in character to
those described elsewhere, that it is unnecessary to allude
to it in detail. A writer in the London Medium and Day-
break of 1878 says: " It is about a year and a half since
I changed my aboue from Stockholm to this place, and
during that period it is wonderful how Spiritualism has
gaineu ground in Sweden. The leading papen;, that used in
my time to refuse to publish any article on Spiritualism
excepting such as ridiculed the doctrine, have of late
thrown their columns wide open to the serious discussion of
the matter. Many a Spiritualist in secret, h.c1.s thus been
encouraged to give publicity to his opinions without stand-
ing any longer in awe of that demon, public ridicule, which
intimidates so many of our brethren. Several of Allan
Kardec's works have been translated into Swedish, among
which I may mention his Evangile sel0t1 le Spiritisme
a.s particularly well-rendered in Swedish by Walter jochnick.
A spiritual Library was opened in Stockholm on the 1st of
April last, which will no doubt greatly contribute to the
spreading of the blessed doctrine. The visit of Mr. Eglin-
ton to Stockholm was of the greatest benefit to the cause.
Let us hope that the stay of )[rs. Esperance in the south of
Sweden may have an equally beneficial effect. :;:{otwith-
standing all this progress of the cause in the neighbouring
country, Spiritualism is looked upon here as something akin
to madness, but even here thor~ are thin, very thin rays, and
very wide a~art, struggling to pierce the darkness. In
Norway, spintualism as known to modern Europe, did not
seem to have become existent until about 188o. A writer
in a number of the l)awn of Light published in that year
says: "Spiritualism is just commencing to give a sign of
its existence here in Norway. The newspapers have
begun to attack it as a delusion and the • expose' of Mn;.
C., which recently took place at 38, Great Russell Street,
London, has made the round through all the papers in
Sca11dinovia. After all, it must sooner or later take root as
in all other parts of the world. l'llr. Eglinton, the English
medium, has done a good work in Stockholm, showing some
of the great savants a new world ; and a couple of years
ago Mr. Slade visited Copenhagen. The works of Mr.
Zollner, the great astronomer of Leipzig, have been men-
tioned in the papers and caused a. good deal of sensation.
" Of mediums there are several here, but all, as yet, afraid
to speak out. One writes with both hands ; a gentleman
is developing as a drawing medium. A peasant, who died
about five years ago, and lived not far from here, was an
excellent healing medium; his name was Knud, and the
people had given him the nickname of Vise Knud (the wise
Knud) ; directly when he touched a patient he knew if the
same could be cured or not, and often, in severe cases, the
pains of the sick person went through his own body. He
was also an auditive medium, startling the people many
times by telling them what was going to happen in the
future ; but the poor fellow suffered much from the ignor-
ance and fanaticism around him, and was several times put
in prison.
" I am doing all I can to make people acquainted with
o•1r grand cause."
A second and more hopeful letter of 1881, addressed to
the editor of the Revue Spirite, is as follows :-
" My dear Brothen;,-Here our science advances without
noise. An excellent writing medium has been developed
among us, one who writes simultaneously with both hands ;
while we have music in a room where there are no musical
instruments ; and where there is a piano it plays itself.
At Bergen, where I have recently been, I found mediums,
who in the dark, made sketches-were dessinateurs-
using also both hands. I have seen, also, with pleasure
that several men of letters l!-nd of science l1ave begun to
investigate our science spirite. The pastor E.ckho.ff, of
Bergen, has for the second time preached against Spiritual-
ism, ' this instrument of the devil, this psychographic' ;
and to give more of eclat to his sermon he has had the
goodnes~ to have it printed; so we sec that the spirits are
working. The suit against the medium, Mme. F., in
London, is going the rounds of the papers of Christiania ;
these journals opening their columns, when occasion offen;,
to ridicule Spiritualism. We are, however, friends of ·the
truth, but there arc scabby sheep among us of a different
temperament. From Stockholm they write me that a
library of spiritual works has been o~ned there, and that
they arc to have a medium from :Newcastle, with whom
seances are to be held.''
In the Londcn Spiritual Magazim of May, 1885, is a long
and interesting paper on Swedish Spiritualism, by William
Howitt, in which he gives quite a notable collection of
narratives concerning Phenomenal Spiritual Manifestations
in Sweden, most of which were furnished by an eminent and
learned Swedish gentlcma.n-Count Piper. The public
have become so thoroughly sated with tales of hauntings,
apparitions, prevision, etc., that Count Piper's narrations
would present few, if any fe.'\tures of interest, save in
justification of one assertion, that Spiritualism is rife in
human experience everywhere, even though it may n0t take
the same form as a public movement, that it has done in
America and England.
As early as 1864, a number of excellent leading articles
commending the 6elief in Spiritual ministry, and the study
of such phenomena as would promote communion between
the " two worlds," appeared in the columns of the Aftotz
Blad, one of the most popular journals circulated in
Sweden.

Witcltcraft.-Witchcraft and sorcery appear to have been
practised in the earliest historical and traditional times.
It is related that during the reign of Natholocus in the
second century there dwelt in Iona a witch of great renown,
and so celebrated for her marvellous power that the king
sent one of his captains to consult her regarding the issue
of a rebellion then troubling his kingdom. The witch
declared that within a short period the king would be
murdered, not by his open enemies but by one of his most
favoured friends, in whom he had most especial trust.
The messenger enquired the assassin's name. " Even by
thine own hands as shall be well-known within these few
dayes," replied the witch. So troubled was the captain on
hearing these words that he railed bitterly against her,
Scotland 350 Scotland
vowing that he wou!d see her burnt before he would commit
such a villainous crime. But after revie,·."ing the matter
carefully in his mind, he arrived at the conclusion that ii he
informed the king of the witch's prophecy. the king might
for the sake of his personal safety have him put to death,
so thereupon he decoyed )latholocus into 9is private
chamber and falling upon him with a dagger sle": him
outright. About the year 388 the devil was so enraged at
the piety of St. Patrick that he assailed the saint by the
who!e band of witches in Scotland. St. Patrick lied to the
Clyde embarking in a small boat for Ireland. As witches
cannot pursue their victims over running water, they flung
a huge rock after the escaping saint, which however fell
harmless to the ground, and which tradition says now
forms Dumbarton Rock. The persecution of witches con-
stitutes one of the blackest chapters of history. All
classes, Catholic and Protestant alike, pursued the crusade
wilh equal vigour, undoubtedly inspired by the passage in
Exodus xxii., 18. While it is most probable that the
majority of th.ose who practised witchcraft and sorcery
were of weak mind and enfeebled intellect, yet a large
number adopted the supposed art for the purpose of inti"mi-
dation and extortion from their neighbours. Witches
were held to have sold themselves body and soul to the
devil. The ceremony is said to consist of kneeling before
the evil one, placing one hand on her head and the other
under her feet, and dedicating all between to the service of
the devil, and also renouncing baptism. The witch was
thereafter deemed to be incapable 'of reformation. No
minister of any denomination w:1atever would intercede or
pray for her. On sealing. the compact the devil proceeded
to put his mark upon her. Wraing on the •· Witches'
:\lark" :\Ir. Bell, minister of Gladsmuir in 1705 says:
" The witches' mark is sometimes like a blew spot, or a
little tale, or reid spots, like fleabiting, sometimes the
flesh is sunk in and hollow and this is put in secret places, as
amongthehairof the head,or eyebrows, within the lips,under
the armpits, and even in lhe most secret parts of the body."
)lr. Robert Kirk of Aberfoill in his Secret Commomcealth
states : ··A spot that I have seen, as a small mo!e, horny,
and b.-own coloured, throw which mark when a large brass
pin was thrust (both in buttock, nose, and rooff of the
mouth) till it bowed (bent) and became crooked, the
witches, both men and women, nather felt a pain nor did
bleed, nor knew the precise time when this was doing to
them (their eyes only being covered)."
In many cases the mark was invisible, and as it was
considered that no pain accompanied the pricking of it,
there arose a body of persons who pretending great skill
therein constituted themselves as " witch prickers " and
whose office was to discover and lind out witches. The
method employed was barbarous in the extreme. Having
stripped and bound hi> victim the witch pricker proceeded
to thrust his needles into every part of the body. When at
last the victim worn O\tt with exhaustion and agony remained
silent, the witch pricker declared that he had discovered
the mark. Another test for detection was trial by water.
The su3pects were tied hands and great toes together,
wrapped in a sheet and flung into a deep pool. In cases
w~ere the body floated, the water of baptism was supposed
to give up tb.e accused, \yhile those who sank to the bottom
were absolved, but no attempt was made at rescue. \Vhen
confession was demanded the most horrible of tortures were
resorted to, burning with irons being gener:J.lly the last
torture applied. In so:ne cases a diabolic contrivance
called the ·• witches' bridle " was used. The " bridle"
encircled the victim's head while an iron bit was thrust
into the mouth fro:n wilich prongs protruded piercing the
tongue, palateand cheek.,. In cases ofexecution, the victim
was usually strangled and thereafter burned at the stake.
Witches were accused of a great variety of crimes. A
common offence was to bewitch m1lc!1 cattle by turning
their milk sour, or curtailing the supply, r.-:isin<>' storms
stealing children from their graves, and prorootin~ variou~
illne:;s~s. .A. popular device ~~·as t:o make a w~x:n image
of the1r Vlctim, thrust p1ns tnto 1t and senr 1t \-:ith hot
irons, all of wilich their victim felt and at length succumbed.
t;pon domestic animals they cast an evil eye, causin"'
emaciation and refusal to take food till at length death
ensued. To those who believed in them and acknowledged
their power, witches were supposed to uSe t!leir powers for
good by curing disease and causing prosperity. Witches
had a weekly meeting at which the devil presided, every
Saturday commonly called ·• the witches' S:J.bbath,"
their meetings generally being held in desolate places or in.
ruined churches, to which they rode through the air
mounted on broomsticks. If the devil was not present on
their arrival, they evoked him by beating th~ earth ·with a
fir-stick, and Sa}>ing •· Rise up foul thief." The witches
:l.ppeared to see him in different guises; to some he appeared
as a boy clothed in green, others saw him dressed in white,
while to others he appeared mounted on a black horse.
After delivering a mock sermon, he heiU a court at which
the witches had to make a full statement of their doings
during the week. Those who had not accomplished
sufficient evil were belaboured with their own broomsticks,
while those who had been more successful were rewarded
with enchanted bones. The proceedings finished with a
dance, the music to which the fiend played on his bagpipes.
Robert Burns in his Tale of Tam o' Shanter gives a.
graphic description of this orgy. There were great annual
gatherings at Candlemas, Beltanc and HaUaw-eve. These
were of an international character at which the witch
sisterhood of all nations assembled, lhose who had to cross
the sea performing the journey in barges of egg-shell, while
their aerial journeys were on goblin horses with enciianted
bridles.
Witchcraft was first dealt with by law in Scp!land when
by a statute passed in 1563 in the Parliament of Queen
:\lary it was enacted: ·• That na maner of person nor
persons of quhatsumever estaite, degree or condition they
be of, take upon hand in onie times hereafter to use onie
mancr of witchcraft, sorcerie, or necromancic, under the
paine of death, alsweil to be execute against the user,
abuser, as the seeker of the response of consultation."
The great Reformer, John Knox, was accused by the
Catholics of Scotland of being a renowned wizard and
having by sorcery raised up saints in the churchyard of
St. Andrews when Satan himself appeared and so terrified
Knox's secretary that he became insane and died. Knox
was also charged lhat by his magical arts in his old age he
persuaded the beautiful young daughter of Lord Ochiltree
to marry b.im. Nicol Burne bitterly denounces Knox for
having secured the affections of " ane damosil of nobil
blude, and he ane auld decrepit creator of maist bais
degree of onie that could be found in the country."
There were numerous trials for witchcraft in the Justici-
ary Court in Edinburgh and at the Circuit Courts, also
session records preserved from churches all over Scol!and
show that numerous cases were dealt with by the local
authorities and church officials. A. J. B. G.
Rodgers, in his Social Life ia Scotlmzd, says : " From
the year 1479 when the first capital sentence was carried
out thirty thousand persons had on the charge of using
enchantment been in Great Britain cruell}' immolated ;
of these one fourth belonged to Scotland. ~o inconsiderable
number of those who suffered on the charge of sorcery laid
claim to necromantic acts ,,;th intents felonious or un-
worthy.
When James VI. of Scotland, in the year 16o3, wa~
Scotland 351 Scotland
called upon to asce:ul the throne of Great Bntain and
:reland, his own native kingdom was in rather a curious
condition. James himself was a man of considerable
learning, intimate with Latin and Theology, yet his book
on Demonology marks him as distinctly superstitious ;
and, while education and even scholarship were compara-
tively common ~:.t this date in Scotlaud, more common in
fact t.l:lan they were in contemporary England, the great
mass of Scottish people shared abundantly their sovereign's
dread of witches and the like. The efforts of Knox and
his doughty confrhes, it is true, had brought about momen-
tous changes in Scottish life, but if the Reformation
ejected certain superstitions it undoubtedly tended to
introduce others. For that stern Calvinistic faith, which
now began to take root in Scotland, nourished the idea that
sickness and accident arc a mark of divine anger, nor did
this theory cease to be common in the north till long after
King James's day.
It is a pity that the royal author, in the cunous treatise
mentioned above, volunteers but few precise facts anent
the practitioners of magic who throve in Scotland during
his reign. But other sources of information indicate that
these people were very numerous, and whereas, in Elizabe-
than England, il was customarY. to put a witch to death
by the merciful process of hanging, in Jacobean Scotla-nd
it was usual to lake stronger measures. In short, the
victim was burnt at the stake ; and it is interesting to
note that on North Berwick Law, in the county of East
Lothian, there is standing to this day a tall stone which,
according to local tradition, wa.~ erstwhile used for the
ghastly business in question. Yet it would be wrong to
suppose that witches and sorcerers, though handled
roughly now and then, were regarded with universal
hatred ; for in seventeenth century Scot/ami medicine and
magic went hand in hand, and the man suffering from a
physical malady, particularly one whose cause he could not
understand, very seldom entrusted himself to a professional
leech, and much preferred to consult one who claimed
healing capacities derived from intercourse "';th the unseen
world. Physicians of lhe latter kind, however, were
generally experts in the art of poisoning ; and, while a
good many cures are credited to them. their triumphs in
the opposite direction would seem to have been much more
numerous. Thus we find that in July, 1702, a certain
James Reid of Musselburgb was brought to trial, being
charged not merely with achieving miraculous cures, but
with contriving the murder of one David Libbertoun, a
baker in Edinburgh. This David and his family, it trans-
spires, were sworn enemies of a neighbouring household,
Christie by name, and betimes their feud grew as fierce as
that between the Montagues and Capulets ; so the
Christies swore they would bring things to a. conclusion,
and going to Reid they petitioned his nefarious aid. His
first act was to bewitch nine stones, these to be cast on the
fields of the offending baker with a view to destroying his
crops; while Reid then proceeded to enchant a piece of raw
flesh, and also to make a statuette of wax-the nature of
the design is not recorded, but presumably Libbertoun
himself was represented-and :1\lrs. Christie was enjoined to
thrust the meat under her enemy's door, and then to go
home and melt the waxwork before her own fire. These
instructions she duly obeyed, and a little later the victim
breathed his last ; but Reid did not go unscathed, and after
his trial the usual fate of burning alive was meted out to
him.
A like sentence was passed in July 1605 on Patrick
Lowrie, a native of Halic in Ayrshire, and known there as
" Pat the Witch," who was found guilty of foregathering
with endless sorceresses of the neighbourhood, and of
assisting them in disinterring bodies which they afterwards
dismembered. Doubtless " Alloway's auld haunted Kirk,"
sJ.cred to the memory of Burns, was among those ransacked
for corpses by the baud ; yet if the crime wa3 a gruesome
one it wa.o; harmless withal, and assuredly Lowrie's ultimate
fate was distinctly a hard one l On the other hand Tsobel
Griersone, a Prestonpans wom~.n. received no more than
justice when burnllo death on the Castle Rock, Edinburgh,
in March r6o7; for the record of her poisonings was a
formidable one, rivalling that of Waincwright or that of
Cellini himself, \vhile it is even recorded that she co;ltrived
to put an end to sc,•eral people simply by cursing them.
Equally wonderful were the exploits of another sorceress,
Belgis Todd of Longniddry, who is reported to have com-
passed the death of a man she h~ted just by enchanting his
cat ; but this picturesque modus opera>•di was scorned by a
notorious Perthshirc witch Janet Irwing. who about the
year 1610 poisoned sundry members of the family of
Erskine of Dun, in the county of Angus. The criminal was
detected anon, and suffered the usual fate ; while a few
years later a long series of tortures, culminating in burning,
were inflicted on Margaret Dein (nee Barclay), whose
accomplishments appear to have been of no commonplace
nature. The wife of a burgess of Irvine, John Dein, this
woman conceived a violent aversion for her brother-in-law,
Archibald ; and on one occasion, when the latter was
setting out for France, Margaret hurled imprecations at
his ship, vowing none of its crew or passengers would ever
return to their native Scotland. Months went by, and no
word of Archibald's arrival reached Irvine; while one day
a pedlar named Stewart came to John Dein's house, and
declared that the baneful prophecy had beeu duly fulfilled.
The municipal authorities now heard of the affair, and
arresting Stewart, whom they had long suspected of
practising magic, they commenced to cross-examine him_
At first he would tell nothing, but when torture had loosened
his tongue he confessed how, along with Margaret Dein, he
had made a clay model of the ill-starred barque, and thrown
this into the sea on a particuiarly stormy night. His
audience were horrified at the news, but they hastened to
lay hands on the so~ceress, whereupon they dealt with her
as noted above.
No doubt this tale, and many others like it, have
blossomed very considerably in the course of being handed
down from generation to generation, and no doubt the
witches of Jacobean Scotlat~d are credited with triumphs
far greater than they really achieved. At the same time,
scanning the annals of sorcery, we find that a number of
its practitioners avowed stoutly, when confronted by a
terrible death, that they had been initiated in their craft
by the foul fiend himself, or haply by a baud of fairies ;
and thus, whatever capacities these bygone magicians
really had, it is manifest that they possessed in abundance·
that confidence which is among the secrets of power, and is
perhaps the very key to success in <1.ny line c>f action. Small
wonder, then, that they were dreaded by the simple,
illiterate folk of their day; and, musing on these facts, we
feel less amazed at the credulity displayed by an erudite
man like James VI., we are less surprised at his declaring
that all sorcerers" ought to be put to death according to the
law of God, the civill and imperiale Law, and municipall
Law of all Christian nations:•
The last execution of a witch in Scotland took place in
Sutherland in 1722. An old woman residing at Loth was
charged amongst other crimes of having transformed her
daughter into a pony and shod by the devil which caused
the girl to turn lame both in hands and feel, a calamity
which entailed upon her son. Sentence of death was
pronounced by Captain David Ross, the Sheriff-substitute.
Rodgers relates : " The poor creature when lead to the
stake was unconscious of the stir made on her account, and
Scotland
warming her wrinkled hands at the fire kindled to consume
her, said she was thankful for so good a blaze. For his
rashness in pronouncing the sentence of death, the Sheriff
was emphatically reproved."
The reign of ignorance and superstition was fast drawing
to a close.
Witchcraft, if it can be so called nowadays, is dealt v.<ith
under the laws pertaining to rogues, vagabonds, fortune-
tellers. gamesters, and such like characters. (See Fortune-
telling.)
Magic and Demonology.-Magic of the lower cultus, perha-ps
the detritus of Druidism, appears to have been common m
Scotland until a late period. We find in the pages of
Adamnan that the Druids were regarded by St. Columba
and his priest as magicians, and that he met their sorcery
with a superior celestial magic of his own. Thus does the
religion of one race beccme magic in the eyes of another.
Notices of sorcery in Scotlatzd before the thirteenth century
are scanty, if we except the tradition that Macbeth encoun-
tered three witches who prophesied his fate to him. We
have no reason to believe that Thomas the Rhymer (who
has been endowed by later superstition with adventures
similar to those of Tannhauser) was other than a minstrel
and maker of epigrams, or that Sir Michael Scot was other
than a scholar and man of letters. '1\forkeis of sorcery
were numerous but obscure, and although often of noble
birth as Lady Glarnis and Lady Fowlis, were probably very
ignorant persons. We get a glimpse ofScottish demonology
in the later middle ages in the rhymed fragment known as
"The Cursing of Sir john Rowll," a priest of Corstorphine,
near Edinburgh, which dates perhaps from the last quart~r
of the fifteenth century. It is an invective against certam
persons who have rifie~ ~ poultry-yard, upon whom the
priest calls down the diVlne vengeance. The demons who
were to torment the evildoers are : Garog, Harog, Sym
Skynar, Devetinus " the devill that maid the dyce,"
Firemouth, Cokadame, Tutivillus, Browny, and Syr
Garnega, who may be the same as that Girnigo, to whom
cross children are often likened by angry mothers of the
Scottish working-classes, in such a phrase as " eh, ye're a
wee girni!lo," and the Scottish verb, to " giro," may find
its origin m the name of a medireval fiend, the last shadow
<>f some Teutonic or Celtic deity of unlovable attributes.
In Sym Skynar, we rna)' have Skyrnir, a Norse giant in
whose glove Thor found shelter from an earthquake, and
who sadly fooled him and his companions. Skymir was,
of course, one of the jotunn or ::-.orsc Titans, and probably
one of the powers of winter; and he may have received the
popular surname of " Sym " in the same manner as we
speak of " Jack" Frost. A great deal has still to be done
in unearthing the minor figures of Scottish mythology and
demonology, and even the greater ones have not received
the attention due to them. In Newhaveo, a fishing district
near Edinburgh, for example, we find the belief current in a
fiend called Brounger, who is described as an old man who
levies a toll of fish and oysters upon the local fisherman. If
he is not placated with these, he wreaks vengeance on the
persons who fail to supply him. He is also described as
" a Flint and the son of a Flint," which proves conclusively
that, like Thor and many other gods of Asia and America,
be was a thunder or weather deity. In fact his name is
probably a mere corruption of an ancient Scandinavian
word meaning "tostrike," which still survives in the Scottish
expression to "make a breenge" at one. To return to
instances of practical magic, a terrifying and picturesque
legend tells how Sir Lewis Bellenden, a lord of session, and
superior of the Barony of Broughton, near Edinburgh,
succeeded by the aid of a sorcerer in raising the Devil in
the backyard of his own house in the Cariongate, some-
where about the end of the sixteenth century. Sir Lewis
Scotland
was a notorious trafficker with witches, with whom his
barony of Broughton was overrun. Being desirous of
beholding his Satanic majesty in person, he secured the
services of one Richard Graham. The results of the evoca-
tion were disastrous to the inquisitive judge, whose nerves
were so shattered at the apparition of the Lord of Hades
that he fell ill and shortly afterwards expired. .
The case of Major Vveir is one of the most Inter-
esting in the annals of Scottish sorcery. " It is certain,"
says Scott, "that no story of witchcraft or necromancy,
so many of which occurred near and in Edinburgh, made
such a lasting impression on the public mind .as that of
Major Weir. The remains of the house in wh1ch he and
his sister lived are still shown at the head of the \Vest
Bow, which has a gloomy aspect, well suited for a necro-
mancer. It was at different times a brazier's shop and
a magazine for lint, and in my younger days was employed
for the latter use ; but no family would inhabit the haunted
walls as a residence · and bold was the urchin from the
High School who da;ed approach the gloomy ;uin at the
risk of seeing the :Major's enchanted staff parading throug.h
the old apartments, or hearing the hum of the necromantic
wheel, which procured for his sister such a character as a
spinner.
" The case of this notorious wizard was remarkable
chiefly from his being a man of some condi!io~ (the son
of a gentleman, and his mother a lady ?f fam1ly m Clydes-
dale), which was seldom the case w1th those that f~ll
under similar accusations. It was also remarkable m
his case that he had been a Covenanter, and peculiarly
attached to that cause. In the years of the Commonwealth
this man was trusted and employed by those who were then
at the head of affairs and was in 1649 commander of the
City-Guard of Edinb~rgh. which procured him his ?tie of
Major. In this capacity he was understood, as ~as mdeed
implied in the duties of that officer at the penod,. to be
very strict in executing severity upon such Royahsts. as
fell under his military charge. It appears that the MaJor.
with a maiden sister who had kept his house, was subJect
to fits of melancholic lunacy, an infirmity easily rec~>n­
cilable with the formal pretences which he made to a h1gh
show of religious zeal. He was peculiar in his gift of
prayer, and, as was the custom of theperiod_. was often
called to exercise his talent by the bedside of s1ck persons,
until it came to be observed that, by some association,
which it is more easy to conceive than to explain, he
could not pray with the same warmth and fluency of
expression unless when he had in his hand a stick of pecu-
liar shape and appearance, which he generally walked
with. It was noticed, in short, that when this stick was
taken from him, his wit and talent appeared to forsake him.
This Major Weir was seized by the magi~trate~ on a st~nge
whisper that became current respecting vzle practices,
which he seems to have admitted without either shame or
contrition. The disgusting profligacies which he con·
fessed were of such a character that it may be charitably
hoped most of them were the fruits of a. depraved imagina-
tion, though he appears to have been 10 many respects a
wicked and criminal hypocrite. When he had completed
his confession, he avowed solemnly that he had not con-
fessed the hundredth part of the crimes which he had com-
mitted. From this time he would answer no interrogatory,
nor would he have recourse to prayer, arguing that, as he
bad no hope whatever of escaping Satan, there was n_o
need of incensing him by Yain efforts at repentance. ~s
witchcraft seems to have been taken for granted on his
own confession, as his indictment was chiefly founded on
the same document, in which he alleged he had never seen
the devil, but any feeling he had of him was in the dark.
He received sentence of death, which he suffered 12th April,
Scotland 353
1670,. at the Ga~low-hill, betwee~ Lctth and ~Edinburgh.
He dted so stuptdly sullen and •mpcnitent as to justify
the opinion that he was oppressed with a kind of melancholy
frenzy, the consequence perhaps of remorse, but such as
urged him not to repent, but to despair. It seems probable
that he was burnt alive. His sister, with whom he was
supposed to have had an incestuous connection, was
condemned also to death, leaving a stronger and more
explicit testimony of their mutual sins than could be
extracted from the :\Iajor. Shegave, as usual, some acc<:'unt
<1f her connecti?n with the queen of the fairies, and acknow-
ledged the asststance she received from that sovereign in
spinning an unusual quantity of yarn. Of her brother she
said that one day a friend called upon them at noonday
with a fiery chariot, and invited them to visit a friend at
Dalkeith. and that while there her brother received informa-
tion of the event of the battle of Worcester. No one saw
the style of their equipage except themselves. On the
scaffold this woman, determining, as she said, to die " with
the greatest shame po!.sible " was with difficulty prevented
from throwing off her clothing before the people, and with
scarce less trouble was she flung from the ladder by the
executioner. Her last words were in the tone of the sect
to which her brother had so long affected to belong :
":\!any," she said, •• weep and lament for a poor old
wretch lil<e me; but alas, few arc weeping for a broken
covenant."
Alchemy.-James IV. was attached to the science of
alchemy. " Dunbar speaks of the patronage which
the king bestowed_ upon certain adventurers, who had
studied the mystcnes of alchemy, and were ingenious in
making 'quintiscence' which should convert other metals
into pure gold ; and in the Treasurer's Accounts there arc
numerous payments for the 'quinta essentia.' including
wages to the persons employed, utensils of various kinds,
coals and wood for the furnaces, and for a variety of other
materials, such as quicksilver, aqua vital, litharge, auri,
tint! tin, burnt silver, alum, salt and eggs, saltpetre, etc.
Considerable su.ms were also paid to several • Potingairs'
for stuff of vanous kinds to the Quinta Esscntia. Thus,
on the 3rd of :Yiarch. 1501, 'the king sent to Strivelin
(Stirling) four Harry nobles in gold,'-a sum equal, as it
is stated, to nine pounds Scots money-' for the leech to
multiply.' On the 27th of :May. tyn, the Treasurer paid
to Robert l3artoun, one of the king's mariners, • for certain
droggis (drugs) brocht home by him to the French leich,
1.3• : 4 : .o:' 0~ the_ nth of February, 1503-4, we find
t'•enty s~tlh,ngs gtvcn · to ;:he man suld mak aurum potabiJe,
be the ktng s commands. And on the 13th of October,
1507, the Treasurer paid six pounds for a puncheon of ";ne
to the Abbot of Tunglanc, to ' mak Quinta Esscntia.' The
credulity and indiscriminate generosity of the Scottish
monarch appear to have collected around him a multitude
of quacks of all sorts, for, besides the Abbot, mention is
made of • the leech with the curland hair • ; of • the lang
Dutch doctor,' of one Fullertone, who was believed to
possess the secret of making precious stones; of a Dr.
Ogilvy who laboured hard at the transmutation of metals,
and many other cmpirics, whom James not only supported
m their experiments, but himself assisted in their labora-
tory. The most noted of these adventurers was the person
who is variously styled in the Treasurer's Accounts ' the
French Leich.' • i\Iaister John the French Leich.' • l\Iaister
John the French Medicinar.' and • French i\laister John.'
The real name of this empiric was Joh.n Damian; and we
learn from Dunbar that he was a native of Lombardy, and
had practised surgery and other arts in France before his
arrival in Scotland. His first appearance at the court of
James was in the capacity of a French leech, and as he is
mentioned among the persons who received • leveray' in
Scotland
1501-2, there c:-.n be no doubt that he held an appointment
as a physician in the royal household. He soon succeeded
in ingratiating him~elf with the Icing, and it i~ probable
that it was from him that James imbibed a strong passion
for alchemy, as he about this time erected at Stirling a
furnace for prosecuting such experiments, and continued
during the rest of his reign to expend considerable sums of
money in attempts to discover the philosopher"s stone.
• .Maister john,' says Bishop Lesley, 'caused the king
believe, that he by multiplying and uthcris his inventions
sold make fine gold of uther metal, quhilk science he callit
the Quintasscncc, whereupon the king made great cost, but
all in vain.' There are numerous entries in the Treasurer's
Accounts of sums paid for saltpetre, bellows, two great
stillatours, brass mortars, coals, and numerous vessels of
various shapes, sizes, and denominations, for the use of
this foreign adept in his mystical studies. ' These, however,
were not his sole occupations ; for after the mysterious
labours of the day were concluded, :llaster John was wont
to play at cards with the sovereign-a mode by which he
probably transferred the contents of the royal exchequer
into his own purse, as efficaciously as by his distillations.'
We find that on the 4th of .March, 1501, nine pounds five
shillings were paid • to the king and the French leich to
play at cartis.' A few months later, on the occasion
of a temporary visit which the empiric found it necessary
to pay to France, James made him a present of his own
horse and two hundred pounds. Early in the year 1504,
the Abbot of Tungland, in Galloway, died, and the king,
with a reckless disregard of the dictates of duty, and e\·en
of common decency, appointed this unprincipled adven-
turer to the vacant office. On the 11th March, the
Treasurer paid • to Gareoch Parsuivant fourteen shillings
to pass to Tungland for the Abbacy to French
Maister Joh;t.' On the 12th of the same month, • by the
king's command,' he paid ' to Bardus Altovite Lumbard
twenty-fi\"C pounds for Maister John, the French Mediciner,
new maid Abbot of Tungland, whilk he aucht (owed) to the
said Bardus;' and a few days later on the 17th, there was
given ·to l\laister John the new maid Abbot of Tungland,
seven pounds.' Three years after, in 1507, July 27, occurs
the following entry : • Item, lent, by the king's command
to the Abbot of Tungland, and can nocht be gcttin fra him
£33: 6: 8.' An adventure which befel this dexterous im-
postor afforded great amusement to the Scottishcourt. On the
occasionofan embassysettingoutfrom Stirling to the court of
France, he had the assurance to declare that by means of a
pair of artificial wings which he had constructed, he would
undertake to fly to Paris and arrive long before the am-
bassadors. • This time,' says Bishop Lesley, ' there was
an Ttaliane with the king, who was made Abbot of Tung-
land. This abbot tuke in hand to fiic with wings, and to be
in France before the said ambassadors ; and to that effect
he caused make ane pair of wings of feathers, quhilk bcin
fcstinitt uponn him he flew off the castle-wall of Stirling ;
but shortly he fell to the ground and broke his thie-bane ;
but the wyte (blame) thereof he ascribed to their beand
some hen feathers in the wings, quhilk yarnit, and coveted
the myddin and not the skies.' This incident gave rise to
Dunbar's satirical ballad entitled, ' OI the Fenyeit Friar
of Tungland,' in which the poet exposes in the most sar-
castic strain the pretensions of the luckless adventurer, and
relates with great humour the result of his attempt to soar
into the skies, when he was dragged to the earth by the
low-minded propensities of the • hen feathers,' which he
had inadvertently admitted into the construction of his
wings. The unsuccessful attempt of the abbot, though,
according to Lesley, it subjected him to the ridicule of the
whole kingdom, does not appear to have lost him the king's
favour, for the Treasurer's books, from October, 1507, to
Scotland 354:
August, 1508, repeatedly mention him as having played at
dice and cards with his majesty ; and on the 8th of Septem-
ber, 1508, • Damianc, Abbot of Tungland,' oblained the
royal permission to pursue his studies abroad during the
space of five years. lie must have returned to Scotland,
however, before the death of James; and the last notice
given to this impostor is quite in character. On the 27th
of l\larch, 1513, the sum of twenty pounds was paid to him

From this reign to that of }.lary no magici.a11 or alchemical
practitioner of note appears to have existed in Scotland,
and in the reign of James VI. too gteat severity was
exhibited a~.\inst such to permit of them avowing them-
selves publicly. In James's reign. however, lived the
celebrated Alexander Seton (q.v.), of Port Seton near Edin-
burgh, known abroad as • The Cosmopolite ' who is said
to have succeeded in achieving the tra!ISmutation of
metals. L S.
Highlfmds.-Pagan Scotland appears to have been
entirely devoid of benevolent deities. Those representa-
t ives of the spirit world who were on friendly terms with
mankind were either held captive by magic spells, or had
some sinister object in view which caused them to act
with the most plausible duplicity. The chief demon or
deity-one hesitates which to call her-was a oae-eyed
Hag who had tusks like a wild bear. She is referred to in
fo!k tales as" the old wife " (Caillcach). ·• Grey Eyebrows "
" the Yellow llluilearteach," etc., and reputed to be a
great worker of spells. Apparently she figured in a lost
creation myth, for fragmentary :.ccounts survive of how
she fashioned the bills, brought lochs into existence
and caused whirlpools by vengeful operations in the sea.
She is a lover of darkness, desolations and winter. With her
hammer she alternately splinters mountains, prevents the
growth of grass or raises storms. )i'umerous wild animal:;
follow her, including deer, goats, wild boars. \Yhen one of
ner sons is thwarted in his love affairs by her, he transforms
her i11to a mountain boulder ·• looking o\·cr the sea," a
form she retains during the summer. Sbe is liberated
again on the approach of wiuter. During the Spring
months the Hag drowns fishermen and preys on the food
supply: she also steals children and roasts them in her
cave. Her progeny includes a brood of monstrous giants
each with several heads and arms. These are continudly
operating against mankind, throwing down houses, abduct-
ing women and destroying growing crops. Heroes who
fight against them require the assistance of the witch who
is called "Wise Woman," from whom they obtain"magic
wands. The witch of Scottish folk tales is the ·• friend of
man," and her profession was eviuenlly regarded in ancient
times as a highly honourable one. \Vizards also enjoyed
high repute ; they were the witch- doctors, priests and
magicians of the Scottish Pagans, and it was not until the
sixteenth century lhat legal steps were taken to suppress
t hem in the Highland distlicts. There was no s un-worship
or moon-worship in Scotlfmd ; neither sun nor moon were
individ ualised in the Grelic language; these bodieS', however
were reputed to exercise a. magical infl.uence. The moon
especially was a " Magic Tank " from which supplies of
power were drawn by t.hose capable of,performing requsite
ceremonies. But although there we.e no lunar or solar
spirits, there were numerous earth and water spirits. T he
" water wife," like the English" mere wife," was a greatly
dreaded being who greedily devoured victims. She must
not be confuS'ed with the Banshee, that fo'ate whose chief
business it was to foretell disasters, either by washing
blood-stained garments or knocking, knocking on a certain
boulder beside a river, or in the locality where some great
tragedy was impending. The water wife usually con-
Scotland
fronted a late traveller at a ford. She claimed him as her
own and if he disputed her claim, asked what weapons he
had to use against her. The unwa.ry one named each in
turn, and when he did so the power to harm her passed
away. One story of this character runs: "The wife rose
up against the smith who rode his horse, and she said,
" I have you : what have you against me? " ":\ly
sword,'' the man answered. " I have that," she said,
" what else?" '' ?>ly shield," the man said. "I have
lhat and you arc mine." ''But," protested the man, " I
have something else." ·' \\'hat is that ? " the water wife
demanded. To this question the cautious smith answered,
" I have the long, grey, sharp thing at my thigh." T his
wa.s his dirk, and not having named it, he was able to make
use of it. As he spoke he flung his plaid round the water
wife and lifted her up on his horse behind him. Enclosed
in the magic circle she was powerless to harm him, and he
rode home with her, deaf to her entreaties and promises.
He took her to his smithy and tied her to the anvil. That
night her brood came to release her. They raised a tem-
pest and tore the roof off the smithy, but the smith defied
t hem. \Vhen day dawned they had to retreat. Then he
bargained with the water wife, and she consented if he
would release her that neither honor any of his descendants
should ever bP. rlrowned in any three rb·ers he might name.
He named three and received her promise, but as she
made her escape shtJ reminded him of a fourth river. " It
is mine still," she added. In that particular river the
smith himself ultimatt!ly perished." To this day fishermen
will not name either the fish they desire to procure or those
that prey on their catches. Haddocks are ·• white bellies,''
salmon " red ones," and the dog-fish " the big black
fellow.'' It io :J.lso regarded unlucky to name a minister, or
refer to Sunday, in a fishing boat-a fact which suggests
that in early Christian times fishermen might be pio\is
churchmen on land but continued to practise paganism
when they went to sea, like the Icelandic )<orsemen who
belie\'ed that Christ ruled their island, and Thor the ocean.
Fairies must not be named on Fridays or at Ilallowe'en.
and Bcltain (M2.}' Day) when charm fires were lit.
Earth worship, or rather the propitiation of earth
spirits, was a prominent feature of Scottish paganism.
There agz.in magic played a IP.ading role. Compacts were
confirmed br swearing over a piece of turf, certain moors
or mounds wc~e ~et apart for ceremonial practices, and
these were visited for the performance of child-procuring
and other ceremonies which were performed at a standing
stone. In cases of sickness a divination cake was baked
and left at a sacred place ; if it disappeared during the
night, tile patient W'.\S supp!)scd to recover; if it remained
untouched until the following morning it was believed that
the patient would die. This practice is not yet obsolete.
Offerings were constantly m~.de to the earth spirits. In
a witch trial recorded in IIumbic I<irk Session Register
(23rd September, 1649) one Agnes Gourlay is accused of
ha'ving made offerings of milk, saying, •· God betuch ws
to; they ?.re wnder the yird that have as much need of it
as they that arc above the yird " ; i.e., " God preserve us
too; t hey arc under the earth that have as much need of
it as they that arc above the c:J.rth." The milk poured out
upon the earth at magic:\! ceremonies was supposed to go to
the fairies. Gruagach stones have not yet entirely van-
ished in the Highlands. These are flat stones with deep
•· cup " marks. After a cow is milked, the milker pours
into a hole the portion of milk required by the Gruagach,
a long-haired spirit who is usually " dressed like a gentle-
man." If no offering is given to him, the cream will not
rise on the milk, and, if it does the churning will be a.
failure. There are interesting records in the Presbytery
records of Dingwall, Ross-shire, regarding the prevalence of
Scotland 355 Scott
milk pounng and other ceremonies dunng the seventeenth
century. Among the "abominations·· referred to are
those for which Gairloch parish continued to 0.· notodous-
" fr~quent approaches to some ruinous chappels and circu-
latcmg them ; and that future c\·ents in re!ert>nCP t-spccialiic

horrified Presbytery to " their adoring of wells and super-
stitious monuments and stones," and to the " sacrifice of
buU~ at a certaine tyme uppon the 25 o! August " and
to ·· pouring milk upon hills as oblationes."
The seer was usually wrapped in the skin o! a sacrificed
bull and left lying all night beside a river. He was -.isited
by supernatural beings in the darkness and obtained
answers regarding future events. Another way to perform
this divination ceremony was to roast a live ca.t. The
cat WM turned on a spit until the " Big Cat " (the devili
appeared and either granted the wish of the performer of
the ceremony, or foretold what was to take placc~ in answer
to a query. At the present day there are many sorvivin"
bc!iefs regarding witchcraft, fairies, the evil eye, second
sight and magical charms to cure or injure.
Individuals, domesticated animals and dwellings arc
ch?...-med against witchcraft by iron and certain herbs or
berries. Tht: evil, eye influence is dispelled by drinking
·· W.'.ter of .s1lver from a wooden bowl or ladle. The
water is taken from a river or well of high repute; silYer is
place.! in it ; then a charm is repeated, and when it has
been passed over a fire, the victim is given to drink an<l
what remains is sprinkled round the hearth-stone with
ceremony which varies in districts. Curative charms are
handed down in families from a male to a female and a
female to a male. Blood-stopping charms arc still re-
garded with great sanctity and the most persistent col-
lectors have bet:n uuable to obtain them from those who
arc reported to be able to usc these with effect. Accounts
are still given of " blood-stopping·· from a distance.
Although the posscJ.Ssor of the power has usually a traditional
ch_ann, he or she rarely uses it without praying also. Some
H1ghland doctors bear testimony in private to the wonder-
ful effects of ·• blood-stopping " operations. A few yea!'S
ago a med1cal officer of Inverness-shire stated in his official
report to the County Council that he was watching with
interest the operations of " King's Evil Curers" who still
etljoy great repute in the \Vestern Isles. These are usually
"seventh sons:· •· Second-sight," like the power to cure
anu slop blood, runs in families. There is not a parish in
the Scottish Highlands without its family in which one
or more individuals are reputed to have occult powers.
Some have visions either while awake or asleep. Others
he.:.r ominous sounds on occasions and are able to under-
stand what they signify. Certain individuals confess,
but '~ith no appreciation of the faculty, th:l.t they are
somet1mes, not always, able to foretell that a person is
likely to die ere long. Two instances of this kind may
be given. A younger brother caught a chill. \Vhen an
elder brother visited him he knew at once the young man
would die soon, and communicated a statt>ment to that
effect to a mutual friend. According to medical ooinion the
patient who was not confined to bed. was in no d~nger, but
thrt>e months afterwards he developed serious symptoms
and died suddenly. \Vhen intelligence of the death was
communicated to the elder brother he had a temporary
illness. The same indiviuual met a gentleman in a friend's
house and had a similar experience : he ·• felt " he could
HOt explain how, that this man was near death. On two
occasions within the followin'{ week he que3tioncd the
gentleman's daughter reg;-..rding her father's health and
was informed that he was ·· a'> u~ual.'' The daughter was
surprised at the mqum~. Two days after this meeting
the gentlem?.n in question expired suddenly whtle sitting
in his chair. Ag:1.in the individual,on hcarinl{ of the death,
had a brief but distressing illness, with symptoms usuallv
associated with shock. The mother of "this man has a
similar faculty. On several occasions she h:~s see11 lights.
One day during the Boer \\'ar an officer passing her door
baue her good-bye as he had been ordered to South Africa.
She said. ·' lie will either he slain or come back deformed,'"
and turned ill immediately. A few months afterwards
the officer was wounded in the lower jaw with a bullet and
returned home with his face much deformed.
The " Second-sight" faculty manifests itself in various
ways, as these instances show, and evidence that it is
possessed by individuals may occur only once or h,;ce in a
lifetime. There are cases, however, in ·which it is con-
stantly acth·e. Those who are reputed to have the faculty
are most reticent regarding it, and appear to llread it. At
the close of the nineteenth century tow-charms to cure
sprains and bruises were sold in a well-known Highland
town by a woman who muttered a metrical spell over each
magic knot she tied as the af!licted part was treated by her.
She hatl numerous patients among all classes. Bone-
setters still enjoy high repute in localities : r:ot many
ye«rs ago a public presentation was made to a Ross-shire
bone-setter in recognition of his life-long strvices to
the community. HIS faculty was inherited from his for-
bears.
Numero\tS in!>tanees may be gleaned in the Highlands
of the appearance of the spirits of the living and the
dead. The appearance of the spirit of a living person is
said to he a sure indication of the approaching death of that
individual. It is never seen by a member of the family, but
appears to intimate friends. Sometimes it speaks and
gives inllication of the fate of some other mutual acquain-
tance. DONALD MACKENZIE.
Scott, David and William Bell : These brothers, of whom
David is by far the more important, certainly deserve a
place in this volume, Born at Edinburgh in 1777, David
lived a comparatively uneventful life, his lofty gifts being
quite unrecognised by his contemporaries, and his death in
I8-t9 being hastened in some degree by this persistent
neglect. Nowadays, however, connoisseurs in Scotland
are beginning to appreciate him, perceiving in his output
techuical merits far transcenlling those of Raeburn himself;
while people who· care for art deal ng with the supernatural
are coming to see, slowly but surely. that Scott's Paracclsus
and Vasco de Cama are in the forefront of work of this kmd ;
and that his beautiiul drawings for The 11 nciMt Mari11er
render the very spirit of Coleridge, the arch-mystic, render
it with a skill unsurpassed in any previous or subsequent
illustrations to the poem.
William Dell Scott was also a native of Edinburgh, being
born there in t8II, and his career was very different from
David's, Ior he won worldly success from the first, an<l ere
his death in 1890 he had received many laurels. Etching
some of his brother"s works, and painting a host of ptctures,
he was also a voluminous writer; and his Autobiography
contains sonw really valuable comments on the mystic
symbolism permeating the paintin_g o! tl_tc m1ddle-ages,
and embodies alw a shrewd and lnteresttng account of
Rossetti's essays in table-turning and kindred practices.
Moreover, William Bell's poems :lre almost all of a meta-
physical order ; and though it is extravagaul to call him
•· the Scottish Dla.ke," as many people have done, his
mystical verse undo.ubtcdly reflects a certain ".meditative
beauty," as Fiona i\facleod once '~Tote on the subject.
Scott 356 Sea Phantoms
Scott ot Scot, 1\ticbael : Scottish Astrologer and lllagician
(II75-1234). Though .11i~hael S~olt's life is wrapped in
obscurity his name is rather a familiar one, various causes
having brought t;1is about. In the first place, Dante refer
to him in his Inferno, speaking of him as one singularly
skilled in magical arts ; while be is also mentioned by
Boccaccio, who hails him as among the greatest masters of
necromancy. Moreover, Coleridge projected a drama
dealing with Michael, whom he asserted was a much more
interesting personality than Faustus ; and then there is a
novel about him by Allan Cunnin~ham, while, above all,
he figures in The Lay of the Last il-llnslrel. And Sir Walter
Scott, no very careful antiquarian, identifies the astrologer
with one Sir Mi~haet Sco:t of Balwearie, who, along with
Sir David Wemyss of Wemyss, went to bring the Maid of
Norway to Scotland in J290; but this identification is
manifestly wrong, for in a poem by Vincent de Beauvais
published so early as 1235, M'ichaet is mentioned as lately
deceased. Of course this does not vitiate the idea that he
emanated from the family of Balwearie, whose estates were
situate near Kirkcaldy, in Fife; and it is almost certain
indeed, that he was a man of gentle birth, it being recorded
that he studied at Oxford university, where it is improbable
he would have gone had his parents not been in compara·
tively affluent circumstances. 'Vhen his Oxonian days
were over Michael proccedeu to the Sorbonne at Paris,
where he acqu'ired the title of mathematicus ; and from the
French capital he wandered on to Bologna, in those days
famous as a scat of learning. He did not tarry here for
long, however, but went to Palermo ; while subsequently
he settled for a while at Toledo, for he was anxious to study
Arabic, and that town afforded good facilities therefor. He
appears to have been successful with these studies, master·
ing the intricacies of the Arabic tongue thoroughly; yet
there was nothing to induce him to continue in Spain, and
accordingly he went to Sicily, where he became attached
to the court of Ferdinand I I., probably in the capacity of
state-astrologer. At least, he is so designated in an early
manuscript copy, now in the Bodleian Library, of his book
on astronomy ; yet it is clear that, at some time or other,
Michael had espouscu holy orders. For in 1223 the Pope,
Honorius III., wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
urging him to procure an English benefice for Scott, while
it appears that in the following year the Archbishopric of
Cashel in Ireland wd.S offered to him, and that he declined
thi~ on account of his total ignorance.of the Erse language.
Th1s refusal to take a post for wh1ch he was unsuited
reflects great credit on him, and it is patent lliat he was
highly esteemed at the Vatican, fvr in 1227 Gregory IX.,
successor of Honorius. made further overtures to the
English primate on behalf of .'lfichael ; and whether these
proved fruitful or not, accoruing to Roger Bacon the
necromancer ca~e to England in 1230, bringing with him
the works of A.r1stotle-at that date virtually unknown in
this country-and contriving to give them a certain popu-
larity amongst scholars.
It is reasonable to suppose that Michael, having come to
England, also paid a visit to his native Scotland. And,
though no documentary evidence is forthcoming to support
this theory, Local tradition at :'IIelrose contends that the
a~trologer came to th-:t town in his old age, and that he
d1e~ there and was bu~ed somewhere in the neighbourhood.
Vanous other places m the Borders likewise claim this
distinction, and Sir Walter Scott tells that, throughout
the.so~lli ~f Sco~land, "any great work of great labour or
anbqu1ty 1S ascnbed either to Auld l\lichael, Sir William
Wallace, or th~ Devil." One popular story about the
necromancer mamta1ns that he used to ride through the air
on a demon horse, and another that he was wont to sail the
seas on the back of some fabulous animal ; while yet a
further Legend recounts that he went as Scottish envoy to
the king of France, and that the first stamp of his black
steed's horse rang the bells of Notre Dame, whereupon his
most Christian majesty granted the messenger all he desired.
As regards the writings of 1.-!ichael, he is credited with a
~ranslation of Aristotle's De Animalibus, but the ascription
IS not very well founded. However, it is :i.lmost certain
that he wrote Qruzsto Curiosa d~ Natura Solis et Lwzae
which is included in the Theatrum Cllemicum ; while hew~

Bodlc1an L1brary attributed to Mtchael, aud it behoves to
add. here that at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, at the

down from generation to generation, and arc curr~nt and
even popular to this day. One of these stories relates how

in r848, the Fox fa;nily at Hydesville called in their neigh-
bours to listen to the mysterious sounds which have since
become famous a<; the •· Rochester Rappings," the gather-
ing W.lS too inform'\) to be C.1Lied a sea11ee, though all the
necessary elements were present ; but within the ne"t two
or three years the contagion spread throughout a lar~e part
of the eastern states, many ''circles" (q.v.) were formed,
and the phenomena which was in the first instance appar-
ently spontaneous was now deliberately induced. In the
early stages of the movement these sea;:c!:s were conducted
by private mediums, w:\o took no fez for their performances,
but later profession'\! mediums arose w;tose sea;zces were
open to the public on the payment of a fee. Both public
and private sea11c~s continued, and still continue, to be an
indispensable feature of spiritualism.
Besides the presence of a medium there are other con-
ditions which must be observed if the seance is to be pro-
ductive of phenomen'\. The chid of these is, perhaps, the
clarkness or semi-darkness of the seance-room, though this
is hy no moans an i:wariable condition. The reason given
by spiritualists is that light interferes with the manifesta-
tions of the spirits, though a less charitable construction is
sometimes put upon the insistent demand for darkness.
Sometimes the actual seance is preceded by playing or
singing, a proceeding which one of Home's sitters st~tes
"always gave u-. a good scaacc." That this playing and
singing was not wit!1out it.; purpose we may readily infer,
for a state of expectancy and increased receptivity might
easily be induced thereby, and it may be recalled, en
passant, that D' Eslon and other disciplc3 of :\Iesmer
enjoined their patients to sing, or had some instrument
played While the patie:-ets wcr.:Seated around the baquet, Or
ma~nctic tub. To return to the se!l..zce; the sitters take
their places around a table and join baads, thus forming a
" chain." The B,\roa de G.lldcnstubbe, ia giving directions
for the formin!{ of a circle and t:\e coaducting of a seance,
says: ·• In order lo for:n a ch.:.in, the twelve persons each
place their right hand on tho t..!.'lle and their left hand on
th~t of their neigbboar,. thus makins a circle round the
ta!>le. Observe that the medium or medium~. if there be
more tb;1.n one, arc en~irely isolated from those who form
the chain." Dr. L~pponi, in his Hyp1Jotism and Spiritism,
says: " He (the medium) ti1en invites so:ne of his
assistants to place their hand$ on the table in the fo!Iowing
manner. The two thumllc oC e.tch perSO<l are to be toac:ting
each other, and e \Ch little tl:l3er is to be in communication
with the little fingers of the persons on either side. He
him>elf complete.; the ch:1ia with his two h::~.nds. The
hands of all together rcqt on the edge of the t::.ble." S.:>me-
limes, again, as in the sc.1ncc.~ for table-turning and t.1lking,
the chain is formed simply by all t:1e op~r;ltors placing their
finger-tips on the table. When the spirits have announced
thcH presence by r:1.ps, tilting of the table, and so on, the
chain may or m:~.y not b~ broken, bnt so lonrr as it remains
unbroken the sitters arc enLirely at the mercy of the spirits.
The phenomena which arc thereafter witnessed are so
diverse and varied thaL sc.uccly any account of a seance
precisely matches another in detail, yet undoubtedly they all
belong to certain wcll-delined classes. In the sphere of
"physical" phenomena we have the movements of furni-
ture, beginning with the table round which the members
of the circle arc Se:ltcu, and affecting, perhaps, all the
furniture in the room. These ao\tics of inanimate objects
in the stance-room arc often practically identical with the
spontaneous outbrM<-; of Lor:: poltergeist. Tnen there are
the levitations (q.v_
) both of the human body and of
furniture and inanimate things. \\'c arc told of heavy
wardrobes being rai~cd to the coiling without visible agency,
and of several mediums floating upwards in like man,ler.
Elongation (q.v.) is another phenomenon of the seance-
room, an increase or apparent increase, of from a few inc!1es
to a foot taking place in the medium's height. Locked
doors and cupboards are opened without keys, and wtth-
out any trace of violence. Apports (q.v.) of small objects-
flowers, fruit, jewels, anything, in fact-are brought fiom
a distance through closed doors and barred windows, or
abstracted in mysterious fashion from sealed boxes.
Inanim"lte thing-; show in their actions an almost human
intelligence. Heavy objects become light enough to be
raised by the touch of a finger, light articles become so
weighty that the combined force of all present will not
suffice to lift them. The medium can bold live coals in Uis
hand, or in his handkerchief, without either being burned.
Instruments arc played upon when no visible hand is near
them, or music is produced from the empty air without any
instruments at all. Luminous hands and !aces float in t lte
air, sometimes recognised by tho sitters as belonging to
deceased friends and rclativt~s. and touchings aud cares~es
are felt. A breeze suddenly ~prings up in the scancc-room·-
though the doors and windows am still closed-and curtains
and the clothes of the sitters arc inflated. If the seance
is an especially successful one, complete spirit fonits m<'.y
be materialised. If the latter manifestation is to be asked
for, a small cabinet is usually :>rovided, into which tt•e
medium retires. Soon aftt!rwards the filmy spirit form or
forms are seen to issue from the cabinet, and in them ti;e
sitters frequently behold lost friends or relatives. The !>ph-it
forms will move about the room, allow the:uselvet to be
touched, and will, on occasion, even converse with their
friends in the flesh, and give away locks of their hair and
fragments of their clothing. Again, the materiatisalicn
may take place in the open, a small luminous cloud being
first perceived, which gradually developes into a complete
hunun figure ; or, as ha~ been known to happen, the spirit
may seem to issue from the medium's side, and remain
united to him by a goss.'lmer filament. In most cases tbe
head and chin are shrouded in white draperies, only a
portion of the face being visible. (See Materiallsation.)
The automatic or ·• psychical" phenomena are of a
different nature. Certam manifestations, such as tablc-
tiltings (q.v.), rapping (q.v.), and sla.te-writing \CJ.v.), whe~e
the communication docs .not app:uently come through tt.e
medium's orgamsm, p:~.rtakc of the character of both
" physical " and •· psychical" phenomena. Purely" psy-
chical " manifestations arc the automatic writing anJ.
speaking of the medium. Sometimes the latter faits
spontaneously into a trance, and delivers spirit messages
while in that St.'ltc, or the medium may remain to all appear-
ances in a n<.>rmal condition. Not only writings and uttt:r-
ancc3, but dra-
wings and musical compositions may be pro-
duced automatically, and though automatism of this sort
is by no means contined to the s6ance-room it still plays a
large part therein, and is espcica.lly i.n favour with the more
serious-minded spiritualists, to whom communications
irom th..: spirit-world arc~ of greater importance than t :oe
tricks of household furniture.
A representative account of one of tho sea11ces of D. 11.
Home (q.v.), is given by H. D. Jcncken in liuma1£ Nll.lure,
February, 1867, as follows :
" Mr. Home had passed into the trance still so oitcn
witnessed, risi.lg from his seat, he laid hold o! an armchair,
which he held at arms' length, and wGS tne:1 lifted about
three feet clear of the ground; travelling tnus suspendetl in
spa.cc, he placed the chair next Lord Adare, and made a
circuit round those in the room, being lowered and raised as
Seance 359 Second Sight
he passed each of us. One of those present measured the
elevation, and passed his leg anti arm under :\Ir. Home's
feet. The elevation lasted from four to five minutes. On
resuming his seal, :\!r. Home addressed Captain Wynne,
communi.cating news to him of which the departed alone
could have been cognisant.
" The spirit form that had been seen reclining on the
sofa, now stepped up to Mr. Home and mesmerised him ; a
hand was then seen luminously visible o,·er his head, about
rS inches in a ''erttcal line from his head. The t::'lnce
state of )fr. liome now assumed a different chaTacter ;
gently rising he spoke a few words to those present, and
then opening the door proceeded into the corridor : a
voice then said :-' He will go out o£ this window and
come in at that window.' The or.ly one who heard the
voice was the :\laster of Lindsay. and a cold shudder seized
upon him as he contemplat1:d the possibility of this occur-
ring, a feat which the great height of the third ·floor windows
in Ashley Place rendered more than ordinarily perilous.
The others present, however, having closely questioned him
as to what he had heard, he at first replied, • 1 dare not
tell you.' when, to the amazement of all, a voice said,' You
must tell ; tell directly.' The Master then said, 'Yes;
yes, terrible to say, he will go out at that window and come
in at this ; do not be frightened, be quiet.' :.\!r. Home
now re-entered the room, and opening the drawing-room
window, was pushed out demi-hori:l:ontally into space, and
carried from one window of .the drawing-room to the
farthermost window of the adjoining room. This feat
being performed at a height of about sixty feet fl·om the
ground, naturally caused a shudder in all present. The
body of ~rr. Home, when it appeared at the window of the
adjoining room. was shunted into the room feet foremost-
th.c window being only t8 inches open. As soon as he had
recovered his footing he l<'.ughed and said, ' I wonder what
a policem'ln would have S<l.id had he seen me go round and
round like a teetotum ! ' The scene was, however, too
terrible-too strange, to elicit a smile; cold beads of per-
spiration stood on every brow, while a feeling pervaded all
M if some great danger had passed : the nerves of those
present had been kept in a st.1te of tension that refused to
rcspo:1d to a jok<:. A change now p~s-;ed o·~er ~~~. Home,
one often ob<;e:vable t.lul'ing the trance sta~cs. indicative, no
doubt, of some other power operating on his system. Lord
Adare had in the mca:nime stepped up to the open window
in the a<ljoining room tv close it-the col.:! air, as it came
pouring in, chilling the room ; when, to his surprise. he
only found the window 18 to 2.1inches open! This puzzled
him, for how could :\!r. Home bave passed outside through
a window only x8 to 2-+ inches open. :_\lr. Home, however
soon set his doubts at rest ; stepping up to Lord Adare he
said, • ~o. no ; l did not close the window : I passed thus
into the air outside.' An invisible power then supported
:1rr. Home all but horizontally in space, and thrust Ills body
into space through the open window, head-foremost. bring-
ing him back azain feet foremost into the room, shunted not
unlike a shutter into a basement below. The circle round
the table having re-formed, a cold current of air passed over
those present, like the rushing of winds.· This repeated ttself
several times. The cold blast of <l.ir, or electric fluid, or
cail it what you m:\y, was accompanied by a loud whistle
like a gust of wind on the mountain top, or through the
le:\ves of the forest in late autumn; the sound was deep,
sonorous, and powerful in the ex1:remc, and a shudder kept
passing over those present, who all heard and felt it. This
rushing sound lasted quite ten minutes, in broken intervals
of one or two mtnutes. All present were much surprised ;
a:1d the interest became intensified by the unknown
tongues in which :\lr. Ilome now con"ersed. Passing
fro:n on'! l.l lJU.l~e to another in rapid succes-
Ston, he spoke for ten minutes in unknown languages.
·• A spirit form now became distinctly visible ; it stood
next to the :\laster of Lindsay, clad, as seen on former
occ.1.Sions, in a long robe with. a girdle, the feet scarcely
to11ching the ground, the outline of the face only clear, and
tho tones of the voice, though sufficiently distinct to be
understood, whispered rather than spoken. Other voices
were now heard, and large globes of phosphorescent lights
passed slowly through the room."
The following extract is taken from an account of a
sia;zce held by Professor Lombroso with. the famous Italian
medium, Eusapia Paladino.
" After a rather long wait the table began to mo,·e,
slowly at first,- a matter explained by the scepticism, not
to say the positively hostile spirit, of those who were this
night in a sear.cc circle for the first time. Then little by
little, the movements increased in intensity. M. Lombroso
proved the levitation of the table, and estimated at twelve
or fifteen pounds the resistance to the pressure which he had
to make with his hands in order to overcome that levitation.
•· This phenomenon of a heavy body sustained in the
air, off its centre of gravity and resisting a pressure of
twelve or fifteen pounds, very much surprised and aston·
ishcd the learned gentleman, who attributed it to the ~.ction
of an unknown magnetic force.
•· At my request, taps and scratchings were heard in the
table. This w01.s a new C."\use for astonishment, and led the
gentlemen to themselves call for the putting out of the
c;;.ndles in order to ascertain whether the intensity of the
noises would be increased, ;;.s had been stated. All re-
mained seated and in contact.
" In a dim light which did not hinder the most careful
surveillance, violent blows were first heard at the midcle
point of lhe table. Then a bell placed upon a round table,
at a distance of a yard to the left of the medium (in such a
way that she was placed behind and to the right of 2\L
Lombroso), rose into the air, and went tinkling over the
heads of the company, describing a circle around our table
where it finally came to rest."
At this seance members of the company also felt themselve
pinched and their clothes plucked, and experienced the
toucl1ings of in,·isible hands on their faces and fingers. The
accuracy of the account-wrilten by M. Ciolfi- was
testified to by Professor Lombroso himself. M. ].
Second Sight : The faculty of foreseeing future event~ which
is supposetl to belong to certain individuals in the Scottish
Highlands. The belle! in seco11d sight dates back to a '·ery
early period in the history of these regions, and is stiil
very far from being extinct, even in the 1:1.0re accessible
parts. s~.ving the name, there is but little in scamd sight
that is peculiar to the Celts of Scotland, for it is allied to the
clairvoyance, prophetic vision, soothsaying, and so on,
which have existed from time immemorial in practically
every part of the world. Yet the seco11d sight has certain
distinctive features of its own. It may, for instance, be
either congenital or acquired. In the former case it
generally falls to the seventh son of a seventh son, by
rcaso:t, probably, of the potency of the mystic number
seven. Sometimes a llighlander may find himself
suddenly endowed with the mysterious faculty. A person
gifted with second sight is said to be" fey." Generally there
is no apparent departure from the normal consciousness
during the vision, though sometimes a seer may complain
of a feeling of disquiet or uneasiness. A vision may be
communicated from one person to another, usually by
contact. but the secondary vision is dimmer than tbal of
the original seer. A frequent vision is that of a funeral,
indic..'Lting that a death will shortly take place in the
community. This is an instance of the seco11d sight taking
a symbolical turn, and perhaps this is its usual form.
Seoret Commonwealth 360
Occasionally the apparition of the doomed man will be
seen-his wraith, or double-while he himself is far distant.
Another form frequently taken by the seexmd sight is that
of " seeing lights." The lights, too, may indicate death,
but they may likev.-ise predict lesser happenings, or have
no significance at all. Thus a light is seen by two persons
to hover above the " Big House," then to travel swiftly in
the direction of the gamekeeper's cottage, where it remains
stationary for a while. On the morrow the gamekeeper is
dead. Again a farmer returning from tbe market is pre-
ceded the whole of the way by a ball of fire, rolling along
the road ahead of him. This time, however, the light
portends no alarming occurrence, and the excitement of the
glen quickly subsides. The lower animals also are said to
possess second sight, which is especially frequent among
dogs and horses. Two men \Vere travelling from Easdale
to Oban on a stormy night. In traversing a short cut
through a wood one of them died from fatigue and exposure.
That night more than one horse had to be carefully led
past the spot by his driver, who as yet knew nothing of the
tragedy. Indeed most Highlanders believe that the faculty
is common to all the lower animals, else why should they
whine and bristle when there is nothing visible to human
eyes, nothing audible to human cars ? Notwithstanding
that the march of civilisation has caused the Highlander
partly to conceal his occult beliefs, at least from the unbe-
lieving Sassenach, the writer can vouch for the fact that
in certain districts second sight is almost a commonplace,
believed in even by those who avow that they are not in the
least " superstitious." ::II. J.

Secret of Secrets : (See Kabala.)
Secret Tradition : It has long been an article of faith with
students of occultism that the secret tenets of the various
sciences embraced within it have been preserved to modern
times by a series of adepts, who have handed them down
from generation to generation in their entirety. There is
no reason to doubt this belief, but that the adepts in
question existed in one unbroken line, and that they all
professed similar principles is somewhat improbable. But
one thing is fairly certain, and that is, that proficiency in
any one of the occult sciences requires tuition from a master
of that branch. All serious writers on the subject are at
one as regards this. It is likely that in neolithic times
societies existed among our barbarian ancestors, similar
in character to the Midiwiwin of the North-American
Indians, the snake-dancers of the Hopi of New 1\lexico, or
the numerous secret societies of aboriginal Australians.
This is inferred from the certainty that totcmisru existed
amongst neolithic peoples. Hierophantic castes would
naturally band down the tradition of tbe secret things of
the Society from one generation to another. The early
mysteries of Egypt, Eleusis, Samothrace, Cabiri, and so
forth were merely the elaboration of such savage mysteries.
There would appear to have been throughout the ages,
what might be called, a fusion of occult beliefs : that
when the hierophants of one system found themselves in
juxtaposition, or even in conflict, with the professors of
another, the systems in question appear to have received
much from one another. It has been said that when the
ancient mysteries arc spoken about, itshould be understood
thatonc and the sameseries ofsacred ceremonies is intended,
one and the same initiatory processes and re\·elations, and
Secret Tradition.
that what is true of one applies with equal certainty to all
the others. Thos Strabo records that the strange orgies in
honour of the mystic birth of Jupiter resembled those of
Bacchus, Ceres and Cybele ; and the Orphic poems identi-
fied the orgies o! Ba.cchus with those of Ceres, Rhea, Venus
and Isis. Euripides also mentions that the rites of Cybele
are celebrated in Asia Minor in an identical manner with
the Grecians mysteries of Dionysius and the Cretan rites
of the Cabiri. The Rev. Ceo. Oliver in his History of
Initiation affirms that the rites of the science which is now
received under the appellation of Freemasonry were
exercised in the antedilu~an world, received by Noah
after the Flood. practised by man at the building of Babel,
conveniences for which were undoubtedly contained in
that edifice, and at the dispersion spread with every
settlement already deteriorated by the gradual innova-
tions of the Cabiric priests, and moulded into a form, the
great outlines of which arc distinctly to be traced in the
mysteries of every heathen nation, and exhibit shattered
remains of the one true system, whence they were derived.
This theory is of course totally mischievous, and although
there may have been likenesses between the rites of certain
societies, the idea that all sprang from one common source
is absurd. One thing, however, is fairly certain: anthrop-
ology permits us to believe that the conceptsof man, religious
and mystical, are practically identical in whatever part of
the world he may exist, and tllcre is every possibility that
the similarity between early mysteries results in this man-
ner, and that it brought about a strong resemblance between
the mystical systems of the older world. \Ve have satis-
factory e~dence that tbc ancient mysteries were recepta-
cles of a great dc;ll of occult wisdom, symbolism, magical or
semi-magical rite, and mystical practice in general; and
we are pretty well assured that when these fell into desue-
tude among the more intellectual classes of the various
countries iu which they obtained, they were taken up and
practised in secret by the lesser ranks of society, even the
lowest ranks, who arc in all ages the most conservative, and
who clung faithfully to the ancient systems, refusing to
partake in the rites of the religions which had ousted them.
The same can be posited of magical practice. The princi-
ples of magic arc universal, and there can be no reason to
doubt that these were handed on throughout the long cen-
turies by hereditary castes of priests, shamans, medicine-
men, magicians, sorcerers. and witches. But the same-
evidence does not exist with regard to the higher magic,
concerning which much more diff1cult questions arise.
\Vas this handed on by means of secret societies, occult
schools or universities, or from adept to adept ? We speak
not of the sorceries of empirics and savages, but of that.
spiritual magic which, taken in its best sense, shades into
mysticism. The schools of Salamanca. the mystic colleges
of Alexandria, could not impart the great truths of this
science to their disciples : its nature is such that com·
munication bv lecture would be worse than useless. It is
necessary to 'suppose then that it was imparted by one
adept to another. But it is not likely that it arose at a
vcrv early per:od in the history of man. In his early
psychological state he would not require it ; and we see
no reason for belief that its professors came into existenc~
at an earlier period than some three or four thousand years
B.C. The undisturbed nature of Egyptian and Babylonian
civilisation leads to the belief that these countries brought
forth a long series of adepts in the higher magic. We kno~v
that Alexandria fell heir to the works of these men, but 1t
is unlikely that their teachings were publicly disseminated
in her public schools. Indi~duals of bigb magical stand-
ing would howe\'cr be in possession of the occult knowledge
of ancient Egypt, and that 'they imparted this to the Gr~ks
of Alexandria is certain. J~'\ter Hellenic and Brzantine-
Secret Tradition 361 Secret Tradition
magical theory is distmctly Egyptian in character, and we
know that its c~otcrlc forms were disseminated in Europe at
a comparatively early date, and that tht:y placed all other
native systems in the background, where they were pursued
in the shadow by the aboriginal witch and sorcerer. We
have thus outlined the genealogy of the higher magic from
early Egyptian times to the European medioeval period.
Regarding alchemy, the C\'idence from analogy is much
more sure, and the same may be said as regards astrology.
These are sciences in which it is peculiarly necessary to
obtain the assistance of an adept if any exccUence is to
be gained in their practice ; and we know th~t the first
originated in Egypt, and the second in ancient Babylon.
\Ve are not aware of the names of those early adepts who
carried the sciences forward until the days of Alexandria,
but subsequent to that period the identity of practically
every alchemical anrl astrological practitioner of any note
is fully known. In the history of no science is the sequence
of its professors so clear as is the case in alchemy, and
the same might almost be said as regards astrology, whose
protagonists, if they have not been so famous, have at
least been equally conscientious. We must pass over in
our consideration of the manner in which occult science
survived, the absurd legends which presume to state how
such societies as the Frecma5ons existed from antediluvian
times; and will content ourselves with stating that the
probabilities are that in the case of mystical brotherhoods
a long line of these existed from early times, the traditions
of which were practically similar. Many persons would be
members of several of these, and would import the con-
ceptions of one society into the heart of another, as we
know Rosicrucian ideas were imported into Masonry.
(See Freemasonry.) We seem to sec in the mystic societie;;
of the middle ages reflections of the older Egyptian ana
classical mysteries, and there is nothing absurd in the
theory that the spirit and in some instances even the letter
of these descended to medi;:eval and perhaps to present
times. Such organisations die much harder than any
credit is given them for doing. \Ve know, for example,
that Freemasonry \'.'as revolutionised at one part of its
career, about the middle of the seventeenth century, by
an influx of alchemists and astrologers, who crowded out
the operative members, and who strengthened the mystical
position of the brotherhood, and it is surely reasonable to
suppose that on the fall or desuetude of the ancient myster-
ies, their disciples, looking eagerly for some method of
saving their cults from entire exttnction, would join the
ranks of some similar society, or would keep alive the flame
in secret; but the fact remains that the occult idea was
undoubtedly preserved through the ages, that it was the
same in essence amongst the believers in all religions and all
mysteries, and that to a great extent its trend was in the
one direction, so that the fusion of the oilier mystical
societies and their re-birth as a new brotherhood is by no
means an unlikely hypothesis. In the article on the
"Templars" for example, we have tried to show the
possibility of th<lt brotherhood having received its tenets
from the East, where it sojourned for such a protracted
period. It seems very likely from what we leun of its
rites that they were oriental in origin, and we know that
the occult systems of Europe owed much to the Templars,
who, probably, after the fall of their own Order secretly
formed others or joined existing societies. :\Iasons have a
hypothesis that through older origins they inherited from
the Dionysian artificers, the artizans of Byzantium, and the
building brotherhoods of Western Europe. To state this
dogmatically a.s a fact would not be to gain so much cre-
dence for their theory as is due to that concerning the
dissemination of occult lore by the l'emplars ; but it is
much more feasible in C\'ery way than the absurd Legend
concerning the rise of Freemasonry at the time of the
building of the Temple. Secret societies of any description
possess a strong attraction for a certain class Qf mind, or
else a merely operative handicraft society, such as was
medioeval Masonry, would not have been utilised so largely
by the mystics of that time. One of the chief reasons that
we know so little concerning these brotherhoods in mcd'ire-
•·al times is that the charge of dabbling in the occult arts
was a serious one in the eyes of the law and the church,
therefore they found it necessary to carry on their prac-
tices in secret. But after the Reformation, a modern spirit
took possession of Europe, and the protagonists of the
occult sciences came forth from their caverns and practised
in the open light of day. ln En~:land, for example, numer-
ous persons avowed themselves alchemists; in Germany the
" Rosicrucians" sent out a manifesto; in Scotland, Seton,
a great master of the hermetic art, arose : never had
occultism possessed such a heyday. But it was nearly a
century later until further secret societies were formed, such
as the Academy of the Ancients and of the Mysteries in
1767; the l<nights of the True Light founded in Austria
about 1780; the Knights and Brethren of Asia, which
appeared in Germany in the same year; the Order of
Jerusalem which originated in America in 1791; the
Society of the Universal Aurora established at Paris in
1783. Besides being masonic, these societies practised
animal magnetism, astrology, Kabalism and even cere-
monial magic. Others were political, such as the Illuminati,
which came to such an inglorious end. But the individual
tradition was kept up by an illustrious line of adepts, who
were much more instrumental in keeping alive the flame
of mysticism than C\'en such s<>cicties as those we have
mentioned. Mesmer, Swedenborg, St. Martin, Pas-
qually, \>Villcrmoz, all laboured to that end. \Ve may
regard all these as belonging to the school of Christian
magicians, as apart from those who practised the rites of
the grimoires or Jewish Kabalism. The line may be
carried back through Lavaler, Eckartshausen, and so on
to the seventeenth century. These men were mystics
besides being practitioners of thcurgic magic, and they
combined in themselves the knowledge of practically all
the occult sciences.
\Vitb :'llesmer began tile revival of a science which cannot
be altogether regarded as occult, when consideration is
given to its modern developments, but which powerfully
influenced the mystic life of his and many L
ater days.
The mesmerists of the first era arc in direct line with the
Martinists and the mystical magicians of the France of the
late eighteenth century. Indeed in the persons of some
English mystics, such as Crcatrakes, mysticism and
magnetism are one and the same thing. But upon " Hyp-
notism," to give it its modern name, becoming numbered
with the more practical sciences, persons of a mystical cast
of mind appear to have, to a great extent, deserted it.
Hypnotism does not bear the same relation to mesmerism
and magnetism as modern chemistry does to alchemy ;
but the persons who practise it nowadays nrc as dissimilar
to t he older professors of the science as is the modern
practitioner of chemistry to the mcdireval alchemist. This
is symptomatic of the occult sciences, that they despise
that knowledge which is '· exact " in the common sense
of the term. Their practitioners do not delight in L
abour-
ing upon a science, the laws of which arc already known,
cutand dried. The studentof occultism, as a rule, possesses
all the attributea of an explorer. Tbe occult sciences ha.ve
from time to time deeply enriched the ~=ct sciences, but
these enrichments have been acts of intc!Lectual generosity.
It is in effect as if the occultist made a present of them to
the scientist, but did not desire lo be troubled with their
future de,·elopment in any way. Occl~tism of the higher
Secret Words 362
sort therefore does not to-clay possess any great interest
in hypnotism, and modern mystics of standing scarcely
recognise it as a part of the hidden mysteries. But there
is no question that the early mesmerists formed a link
between the adepts of eighteenth-century France and those
of the present day. The occultists of to-day, however, are
barking farther back : they recognise tha.t their fore-
runners of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries drew
their inspiration from older origins, and they feel that these
may have bad cognisance of records and traditions that we
wot not of. The recovery of these is perhaps for the
moment the great question of modern magic. But apart
from this, modern magic of the highest type strains towards
mysticism, and partakes more than ever of its character.
It disdains and ignores ceremonial, and exalts psychic
experience. Tbat is not to say tbat numerous bodies do
not ex1st throughout the world for the celebration of
magical rite; but such fraternities have existed from time
immemorial, and tfieir protagonists cannot be placed on a
higher footing than the hallucinated sorcerers of rnedi<eval
times.
Secret Words : Certain words relating to the Eucharist were
communicated by Christ to joseph of Arimatbea and were
committed orally from keeper to keeper of the Graal. In
Robert de Borron's metrical romance, material power is
added to their spiritual efficacy and whoever could acquire
and retain them, had a mysterious power over all around
him, could not suffer by evil judgments, could not suffer
deprivation of his own rights. need not fear the result of
battle, provided his cause were good. The words were the
secret of the Graa.l and were either incommunicable in
writing or were written only in the Book of the Graal which,
de Borron implies, was itsel£ written by joseph of Arima-
thca. These words are the chief mystery of the Lesser Holy
Gra.al, as the prose ''crsion of de Borron's poem is called.
They were most probably a form of eucharistic consecra-
tion, and there is evidence that the Celtic church, following
the example of the Ea~tern Church used them in addition
to the usual consecration as practised in the Latin Church,
which is merelr a repetition of the Xew Testament account
of the Lord's Supper. The separate clause they are sup-
posed to have formed is called Epic!csis and consisted of an
invocation o[ the Holy Ghost.

Semites, The : This article on the Semites applies to the more
ancient divisions of the race, such as the Babrlonians and
Assvrians, and the Hebrews in Biblical times. For later
Semitic occultism see Kabala, Arabs, etc. In ancient
Babylon, and Chaldea, magic was of course a department
of priestly :\ctivity. and in )lesopotamia we find a sect of
priests, tl1e .\sipu, set apart for the practice of magic, which
in thc:ir ca~e probably consisted of hypnotism, the casting
out of demons, the banning of troublesome spirits and so
forth. The Baru agaiu were augurs who consulted the
oracles on the future by the inspection of the entrails of
animals and the flight of birds, ··the observation of oil in
w,Lter, the secret of Anu, Bel, and Ea, the tablet of the gods,
the S:\Cbet of leather of the oracle.; of the heavens and
eJ.rth, the wand of cedar dear to the great gods." These
priests of Ba.ru and A~ipu were clothed in vestments pecu-
har to their rank, which they changed fr<:quentlyduring the
ceremonies in which they took part. In the tablets we
find king$ making fre<1uent enquiry through these priestly
cao;tcs; and in a tablet of Sippar, we find treated the
i':l.stallati_on of a Baru to the Sun-temple, and also Sennach-
no scekmg through the Baru the causes of his father·s
vi•>lent dcuh. Tne Asipu again w.:re exorcists, who
re!"noved tab;~s and laid ghosts. We find an Asipu's func-
tlOnS set forth in the followmg poem :-

The third caste was the Zammaru, who sang or chanted
certain ceremonials.
The lower ranks of sorcery were represented by the
Kassapu and 1\:assaptu, the wizard and witch, who, as else-
where, practised black magic, aald who are stoutly C9to-
batecl by the priest-magician caste. We find in the code
of Hammurabi a stringent law against the professors of
black magic:-" I£ a .man has charged a man with sorcery
and has not justified himself, he who is charged ";th sorcery
shall go to the river, he shall plunge into the river, and if
the river ovt:rcome him, he who accused him shall take to
himself his house. If the river makes that man to be inno-
cent, and he be saved, he who accused him shall be put to
death. He who plunged into the river shall take to him-
self the house of him who accused him." This \riJJ recall
Semites, The
the t_es~ for a witch, that if thrown into a pond, if she sinks
she IS mnocent, but if she floats she is a witch indeed.
Another series of tablets deals with the black magician and
the witch who are represented as roaming the streets,
entering houses, and prowling through towns, stealing the
love of men, and withering the beauty of women. The
exorcist goes on to say that he has made an image of the
witch, and he calls upon the fire-god to burn it. lie
scir~:es the mouth, tongue, eyes, feet, and other members
of the witch, and piously prays that Sin may cast her into
an abyss of water and fire, and tl1at her face may grow
yellow and green. He fears that the witch is directing
a like sorcery against himself, that she sits making spells
against h.im iu the shade of the wall, fashioning images of
h.im. But he sends against her the haltappa11 plant and
sesame to undo her spells and force back the words into her
mouth. He devoutly trusts that the images she has
fashioned will assume her own character, and that her
spells may recoil upon herself. Another tablet expresses
the desire that the god of night may smite the witch in her
magic, that the three watches of the night. may loose her
evil sorcery, that her mouth may be fat and her tongue
salt, that the words of evil that she hath spoken may be
poured out like tallow, and that the magic she is working be
crumbled like salt. The tablets abound in magical matter
and in them we have the actual wizardry in vogue at the
time they were written, which runs at least from the
seventh century B.C. onwards until the time when the
cuneiform ceased to be used. Chaldean magic was re·
nowned throughout the world, particularly, however, its
astrological side. Isaiah says "Let now the astrologers,
star-gazers, monthly prognosticators, stand up and save
thee from the things that shali uvii:.;; :!~"" thee." In the
book of Oan.iel, we find the magicians called Chaldcans, and
up to the present time occultists have never tired of sing-
ing the praises of the Chaldean magi. Strabo and .IElian
allude to their knowledge of astrology, as did Diodorus
Siculus, and it is supposed to have been a Chaldcan magician
<Ethanes who introduced his science into Greece, which he
entered with Xerxes.
The great library of Assurbanipal, king of Assyria,
who died in 626 B.C., affords us first-hand knowledge of
Assyrian magic. He gathered together numerous volumes
from the cities of Babylonia, and storing them in his
great library at ~ineveh, had them copied and translated.
In fact letters have been discovered from Assurbanipal to
some of his officials, giving instructions for the copying
of certain iucantations. .Many grimoires too come from
Babylonia, written during the later empire,-t.he best
known of wilich are the series entitled 1\ilaRlu, buming ;
Ult~.~ki. linwuli, evil spirits ; Labarlu, hag-demon ; and
Nis kati, raising of the hand. There are also available
many ceremonial texts which throw considerable light on
magical practice. The 11tfakl11 for exam:ple contains eight
tablets of incantations and spells ag<unst wizards and
witches-the general idea running through it being to
instruct the bewitched person how to manufacture figures
of bis enemies, and thus destroy them. The series dealing
with the exorcism of evil spirits enumerates demons,
goblins and ghosts, and consists of at least sixteen tal>lets.
They are for the use of the exorcist in driving out devils
from possessed people, and this is to be accomplished by
invoking the aid of the gods, so tl1at the demons may be
laid under a divine tabu. The demon who possesses the
unfortunate victim must be described in the most minute
manner. The se:-ies dealing with the Labarlu or hag-
demon, wllo is a kind of femc.le devil who delights in
attacking children, gives directions for making a figure of
the Ltd>artu and the incantations to be repeated over it.
The magician and philosopher appear to have worked

utterance. The knowledge of the name, or descnpt10n,
of the person or den:on the magician directs his cha!m
against, is also essent1al to success. Drugs also, to w!uch
were originally ascribed the power vouchsafed by the gods
for t11e weliare of mankind, were supposed to aid greatly in
exorcism. In Assyrian sorcery, Ea and ~Iarduk arc the
most powerful gods,-the latte~ being appea!ed to as
intermediary between man and his father, Ea.: mdeed the

monly repeated in incantations. \\Then workmg_ agatnst an
indi\·idual too, it was necessary to have someUung belong·
ing to him,-clippings of his hair, or nails if poss~blt;. The
possessed person was usu~lly w_ashed, the prtnCIJ>al of
cleansing probably under~ymg th,_s ceremony. An u~can·
tation called the Incantation of Endu was often prescnbed,
and this must relate to some such cleansing, for Eridu is
the Home of Ea, the Sea-god. A formula for exorci~ing
or washing away a demon, Rabesu st~tes that t~e pat1ent
is to be sprinkled with clean water tw1ce seven bmes. Of
all water none was so sacred as the Euphrates, and water
from it was frequently used for charms and exorcisms.
Fumigation with a censor was also employed by the A:i.-
syrians for exorcism, but the possessed person was often
auarded from the attack of fiends by placing him in the
~iddle of an enchanted circle of flour, through which it was
thought no spirit could break. Wearing t!'c glands from
the mouth of a fish was also a charm agatnst posscss1on.
In making a J:Pagic circle. the sorcerer usually formed ~even
little winged figures to set before the god Nergal, wJth a
long spell, which states that he has completed the usurtu or
magic circle with a sprinkling of lime. The wizard furth~r
prays thai the incantation may be performed for hts
patient by the god. This woul~ ~eem to be .a prot~type
of the circle in use amongst mag~ctans of medtreval t1mes.
Says Campbell Thompson in his Semitic Magic:-
" Armed with all these things-the word of power, the
acquisition of some part of the enemy, the usc of the m~gic
circle and holy water, and the knowledge of the mag1cal
properties of substances-the ancient warlock was '~ell
fitted for his trade. He was then capal>le of defyang
hostile demons or summoning friendly spirits, of dri•·ing
out disease or casting spells, of making amulets to guard
the credulous who came to him. Furthermore, he h;~d a
certain stock-in-trade of tricks which were a steady source
of revenus. Lovesick youths and maiuens always hoped
for some result from his philtres or love-charms ; at the
demand of jealousy, he was ever ready to put hatred
between husband and wife ; and for such as had not the
pluck or skill even to use a dagger on a dark night, his
little effigies, pierced with pins, would bring death to a
rival. He was at once a physician and wonder-worker for
such as would pay lli:n fee." . . . .
"Among the more modern Semues magtc IS greatly l.ll ,·ogue
in many forms, some of them quite familiar to Europeans :
indeed we find in the Arabia1: Nights edited by Lane, a
story of old women riding on a broom-stick. Among
Mahommedans the wizard is thought to deserve death by
reason of the fact that he is an unbeliever. \Vitches are
fairly common in Arabic lore, and we usually nud them

witch is usually supposed to be able to leave her dwcllino
at night by sprinkling some of the ashes of the hearth on th~
forehead of her husband, whereby he sleeps soundly till the
morning. This is identical with French mediawal practice.
In Arab folk tales the moghrel>i is the sorcerer who has con-
verse with demons, and we find many such in the Old and
New Testaments, as well as diviners and other practitioners
of the occult arts. In the Saahedri11, Rabbi Akiba. defines
an enchanter as one who calculates the times and hours,
and other rabbis state that ·• an enchanter is be who grows
ill when his bread drops from his mouth, or if he drops the
stick that supports him from his hand, or if his son calls
after him, or a crow caws in his hearing, or a deer crosses
his path, or he sees a serpent at his right hand, or a fox on
his left.'' The Arabs believe that magic ";n not work
while he that employ~ it is asleep. Besides it is possible
to over-reach Satan ltimself, and many Arabic tales exist
in which men of wisdom and cunning have succeeded in
accomplishing this. 'lblis once sent his son to an assembly
of honourable people with a flint stone, and told him to have
the Hint stone woven. He came in and said, " i\Iy father
sends his peace, and wishes to have this tlint stone woven."
A man with a goat-beard said, "Tell your father to have it
spun, and then we will weave it.'' The son went back,
and the Devil was very angry, and told his son never to
put forth any suggestion when a goat-be.:\rded man was
present, " for he is more devilish than we." Curiously
enough, Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiab makes a similar
request in a contest against the wise men of Athens, who
have required him to sew together the fragments of a
broken millstone. He asks in reply for a few threads
made of the fibre of the stone. The good folk of .:.Iosul,
too, have ever prided themselves on a ready wit against the
Devil. Time was, as my servant related to me, when
Iblis came to .:.Iosul and found a man planting onions.
They fell to talking, and in their fellowship agreed to divide
the produce of the garden. Then, on a day when the
onions were ready, the partners went to their ,·egetable
patch and the man said, •· Master, wilt thou take as thy
half that which is above ground or that which is below ? "
::-<ow the Devil saw the good green shoots of the onions
sprouting high, and sC> carried these off as his share, leaving
the gardener chuckling over his bargain. But when wheat
time came round, and the man was sowing his glebe on a
day, the Devil looked over the ditch and complained that
he had m.:\de nothing out of the compact. "This time,
quoth he, we will divide differently, and thou shalt take the
tops " ; and so it fell out. They visited the tilth together
and when the corn was ripe, and the fellah reaped the
neld and took away the ears, leaving the Devil stubbing up
the roots. Presently, after he had been digging for a
month, he began to find out his error, and went to the man,
who was cheerily thrc•hing his portion. ·• This is a paltry
quibble," said lblis, "thou hast cozened me this twice."
"Nay," said the former, "I gave thee thy desire; and
furthermore, thou didst not thresh out thine onion-tops. as
I am doing this." So it was a sanguine Devil that sent
away to beat the dry onion-stalks, but in vain; and he
left ?.Iosul sullenly, stalking away in dudgeon, and stopping
once in a while to shake his hand against so crafty a town.
" Cursed be he, ye tricksters 1 who can outmatch devilry
like yours ? "
" In modern times in the East," says ;\lr. Thompson,
" from :'llorocco to :\lesopotamia, books of magic arc by no
means rare, and manuscripts in Ara'Qi.c, Hebrew, Gcrshuni,
and Syria.c can frequently be bought, all dealing with some
form of magic or popular medicine. In Suakin in the
Soudan I was offered a printed book of astrology in Arabic
illustrated by the most grotesque and bizarre woodcuts of
the signs of the Zodiac, the blocks for which seem to have
clone dut)' in other placts. Such books e"isted in manu-
script in. ancient days, as is vouched for by the story of the
Sibylline books or the passage in Acts xix., 19; • Not a
few of them tbat practised curious arts brought their books
together, and burned them in the sight of all.' "
It is curious to find the charm for raising hatred practi-
cally the same among the Semites as it is amongst the
peoples of Hungary and the Balkan States: that is
through the agency of the egg of a black ben. \Ve find too,
many minor sorceries the same among the Semites as
among European races. To 1>e invisible was another at-
tainment much sought after, and it was thought that if
one wore a ring of copper and iron engr<>ved with certain
rna"ic signs this result would be secured, or the he<>.rt of a
bh1.~k cat, dried and steeped in honey. The article ·• Solo-
mon " can be referred to for several instances of potent
enchantments. Sympathetic magic is often resorted to by
the Arabic witch and wizard, just as it was amongst the
ancient Hebrews and Assyrians.
The great repertory of Semitic occultism is of course the
I<abala, to which the reader is referred for later Hebrew
mystical doctrine.

Setna, Papyrus of : A papyru;o Qf very ancient date, dealing
with the personality qf Pnnce Setna Kha-em-ust, son of
Rameses II. of Egypt, and said to have been discovered
by him under the head of a mummy in the ;)iecropolis at
:\Iemphis. Says Wiedemann con~erning it : The first tex~. ·
which has been known to us stnce 1867, tells that thiS
prince, being skilled and zealous in the practice of necro-
mancy, was one day exhibiting his acquirements to the
learned men of the court, when an old man told him of a
maoic book containing two spells written by the hand of
Thgth himself, the god of wisdom. He who repeated the
first spell bewitched thereby heaven and earth and tbe
realm of night, the mount.ains and the dept.h of the sea;
he knew the fowls of the lUI' and every creepmg thing ; he
saw the fishes, for a divine power brought them up out of the
depth. He who read the second spell should have power
to resume his earthly shape, even though he dwelt m the
grave; to see the sun rising in the sky with all the gods and
the moon in the form wherein she displays herself. Setna
inquired where this book was to be found, and learned
that it was lying in the tomb of Nefer-ka-Ptah, a son of
King :\Icr-ncb-ptah (who is nowhere else named), and that
any attempt to take away the book would cerWinly meet
with obstin:\te resistance. These difficulti()l; did not with-
hold Set11a from the adventure. He entered the tomb of
Ncfer-k4-Ptah, where he found not only the dead man,
but the lU of his wife Ahuri a!ld their son, though these
latter had been buried in Koptos. I3ut as in many other
tales among many other peoples, success brought no

!>Iessin.,. to the m:u1 who had disturbed the repose of the
dead. "setua fell in love with the daughter of a priest at
:\Iemphis, who turned out to be a. witch, and took adva.n-
ta..,.e of his intimate connection with her to bring him to
ig~ominy and wretchedness. At length the prince recog-
nised and repented of the sacrile~e he had committed in
carryin.,. off the book, and brought •t back to Ncfer:ka-Ptah.
In the hope of atoning to some extent for his sin he journeyed
to Koptos, and finding tt.e graves of the wife and child of
Nefer-Jc..'\-Ptah, he solemnly restored their mummies to the
tomb of the father and husband, carefully closing tho
tomb he had so sacrilegiously disturbed. The second
text, edited two years ago by Griffith from a London
-papyrus, is ~lso genuinely Egyptian in its details. T~ree
magic tales, lJlterwoven one wttb another, arc brought 1nto
connection with Saosiri, the supernaturally born son of
Setna. In the frrst, Saosiri, who was gTeatly Setna's
superior in the arts of magic, led his father down into the
underworld. They penetrated into the judgment-hall
of Osiris, where the sights they saw convinced Setna that
a. glorious future aw3:ited the poor man w~o ~hould cleave
to righteousness. wh1le he who led an ev1l hfc on earth,
though rich and ·powerful, must expect a terrible doom.
Saosiri next succeeded in saving his father, and with him
all Egypt, from great difficulty by reading without breaking
the seal of a closed letter brought by an Ethiopian magician.
whom he thus forced to recognise the superior power of
Egypt. The l;~sl part of the text tells of a powerful
magician once dwelling in Ethiopia. who modelled in wax
a litter with four bearers to whom he gave his life. He
sent them to Egypt, and at his command they sought out
Pharaoh in his palace, carried him ofi to Ethiopia, and,
after giving him five hundred blows with a cudgel, con-
veyed him during the same night back to Memphis. Next
morning the king displayed the weals on his back to his
courtiers. one of whom. Horus by name, was sufficiently
skilled in the use of amulets to ward oft by their means an
immediate repetition of the outrage. Horus then set
forth to bring from Het:mopolis, the all-powerful magic
book of the god Thoth, and by its aid he succeeded in
treating the Ethiopian king as the Ethiopian sorcerer had
treated Plu~raoh. The foreign magician then hastened to
Egypt to engage in a contest v.-ith Horus in magic tricks.
His skill was shown to be inferior, and in the end he and his
mother received permission to return to Ethiopia under a
solemn promise not to set foot on Egyptian territory for a
space of fifteen hundred years.
Seton (or Setbon) Alexander, was one of the very few alchem-
ists who succeeded in the gTeat experiment of the transmu-
tation of metals. He took his name from the village of
Seton, which is stated to have been in the vicinity of Edin-
burgh and close to the sea-shore, so that one may reasonably
conclude that the little fishing community of Port Seton is
meant, although Camden in his Brittania states that that
was the name of his house. In the year t6or, the crew of a.
Dutch vessel had the misfortune to be wrecked on the
coast near his dwelling, and Seton personally rescued several
of them, lodged them in his house, and treated them with
great lcindness, ultimately sending them back to Holland
at his own expense. In the following year he visited
Holland, and renewed his acquaintance with at least one of
the ship-wrecked crew, James Haussen, the pilot, who
lived at Arksun. Hausscn, determined on repaying him
for the hospitality he had received in Scotland, entertained
him for SOI'\lC time in his house, and to him Seton disclosed
the information that he was a master of the art of alchemy,
and proved his words by performing several transmutations.
Haussen, full of the matter, confided it to one Venderlinden,
a physician of Enkhuysen, to whom he showed a piece of
gold which he had himself seen transmuted from lead.
Seton
This Venderhnden's grandson in turn, showed to the
celebrated author, D. G. )lorhoff, who wrote a letter con-
cerning it to Langlet du Fresnoy, author of iht: Histoire de
la Philosophic Jlermllique.
Seton visited Amsterdam and Rotterdam, travelled by
sea. to Italy, and thence through Switzerland to Germany,
accompanied by a professed sceptic of alchemy, one Wolf-
gang Dienheim, whom he convinced of the error of his
views at Basic before several of its principal inhabitants.
This person has described Seton, and from the pen picture
he gives of him we can discern a typical Scot of the seven-
teenth century. "Seton," he says, '' was short but stout,
and high-coloured, with a pointed beard, but despite his
corpulence, his expression was spiritual and exalted."
" He was," adds Dienheim, " a native of .:'11olier, in an
i.sland of the ocean." One wonders if Molier is the German's
corruption of Lothian.
Several experiments of importance were now demon-
strated by Seton. In one of these the celebrated physician
Zwinger himself brought the lead which was to be trans-
muted from his own house. A common crucible was
obtained at a goldsmith's, and ordinary sulphur was bought
on the road to the house where the c:..,eriment was to
take place. Seton handled none of these materials and
took no part in the operation except to give to those who
followed his directions a small packet of powder which
transformed the lead into the purest gold of exactlr the
same weight. Zwinger appears to have been absolutely
convinced of the genuine nature of the experiment, for he
wrote an account of it to his friend Dr. Schobinger, which
appears in Lonig's Ephemerides. Shortly after this Seton
left Baste, and changing his name went to Strasbourg,
whence he travelled io Cologne, lodging with one Anton
Bordemann, who was by way of being an alchemist. In
this city he was sufficiently imprudent to blazon his kuow·
ledge far and widc,-on one occasion producing six ounces
of gold through the application of one grain of his magical
po\Yder. The circumstance seems to have made an
impression on at least one of the savants of the Cathedral
City, for Theobald de Hoghelande in his llistoria Aliquot
Trammutatio•1is MeUalica, which was published at
Cologne in 1604. alludes to it.
Seton then went to Hamburg, whence he tra'·elled
south to Munich, where something more important than
alchemy engaged his attention, for he eloped with the
da\lghter of a citizen, whom be married. The young
Elector of Saxony. Christian II. had heard of Seton's
brilliant alchemical successes and invited him to his court,
but Seton, loath to leave his young wife, sent his friend,
William Hamilton, probably a brother-Scot, in his stead,
with a supply of the transmuting agent. In the prt:sence
of the whole Court, Hamilton undertook and carried
through an experiment with perfect success and the gold
then manufactured resisted every known test. This
naturally only whetted t he Elector's desire to sec and
converse with the magus, and a pressing invitation, which
amounted to a command. was dispatched to Seton, who,
thus rendered unable to refuse, betook himself to the
electoral court. lie was received there with e\'ery mark
of honour, but it soon became evident to him that Christian
II. had only invited him thither for the purpose of extract-
ing from him the nature of his grand secret, but Setou, ~s
an adept in the mysteries of alchemy, remained true to h1s
high calling, and flatly refused to gratify the Elector's
greed. Promises of preferment and threats were alike
indifferent to him, and in the end the Elector, in a passion,
ordered him to be imprisoned in a tower, where he was
guarded by forty soldiers. There he was subjected to cYery
conceivable species of torture, but all to no purpose. The
rack, the fire, and the scourge, failed to extort from him
Seton 3GG Shelta Thari
the methods uy which he h<Ld achle,·ed the grand a rcanum.
Quite as cxhau3ted as his victim, the Elector a1: la~t for-
bore. and left the unforlunatc Scot iu peace.
At this juncture a \foravian chemist, :\Iichael Sendi-
YOgius, who happened to be i:1 Dresden heard of Se:•
m's
terrible experiences and possessed sufficient influe:-~ce to
obtain permission to ,·isit him. Himself a searcher afte.-
the phiJo3opher's StO:lC, he S)'mpathiscd deeply with the
adept, and propos~d to him that he should attempt t<>
effect his rescue. To tl1is Seto11 agreed, and pro;uiscd tllat
ii he were fortunate enough to escape, he would rc:w.>rtl
Sendi,•ogius With his secret. The :\lor<Lvian tra,·elled back
to Cr.:cow, wherc he resided, sold up his property, and
returned to Dre,dcn, where he lodged near Seton's place o(
confinement, entertain• ng the soldiers who guarded t he
alchemist, and judiciuusly bribing those who were directly
concerned in his imprisonme:-~t. At last he judged that
the time was ripe to attempt Seton's sah·ation. He feasted
the guards in a manner so hl>end that all of them were soon
in a condition of tipsy carelessness. He then hastened to
the tower in which Seton was imprisoned, but fuund him
unable to walk, through the severity of his tortures. IJe
therefore supported him to a carriage which stood waiting,
and which they gained without being observed. They
halted at Seton's house to take up his wife, who had in her
possession some oi the all-important powder, and whipping
up the horses, sped as swiftly as possible to Cracow, which
they reached i:1 safety. When quiclly settled in that city,
Sendivogius reminded Sctou of his promise to assist him m
in his alchemical projects, b;•t waq met with a stern refusal,
Seton explaining to him that it was impossible for him as an
adept to reveal to his rescuer the terms of such an awful
mystery. The health of the alchemist was, howe,·er,
shattered by the dreadful torments through which he had
passed, and which he sunri,·ed only for about two yearS,
presenting the remains of his mag•cal precipitate to his
preserver. The possession of this powder only rr.ade
Sendivogius more e:>..!(er than ever to penetrate tlte myster-
ies of the grand arcanum. He married Setoa's widow,
perhaps with the idea that she was in pos::ession of her iate
husband's occult knowledge, but if so he was doumed to
dis~ppointment for she ,..-as ab~olutely ignorant of the
matter. Seto11 had left belund !11m, however, a treatise
entitied The .\'ew L•ght of Alclzymy, which Sendivogius
laid hands on and publishe~ as his own. In its pages he
thought he saw a method of increasing the powder. but
to his intense disappointment and disgust, he only succeeded
in lessening it. With what remained, however, he poseJ
as a successful projector of the grand mystery, and pro-
ceeded with much splcnduur from court to court in a sort of
triumphal procession. In his own country of :\loraYia, he
was imprisoned, but escaped. His powder, howe\'cr,
was r~.pidly c.liminishing, but he still co:-~tinued his experi-
ments. Uorel in his work on .French Antiquities mentions
that he saw a crown piece which had been partially dipped
into a mixture of the powder dissolved in spirits of wine,
and that the part steeped in the elixir was of gold, 'was
porous. and was not soldered or otherwise tampered
with. The powder done, Sendivogius degenerated into a
mere charlatan, pretending that he could manufacture gold,
and receiving large sums on the strength of being ab!e to
do so. He survived until the year 1646 when he died at
Parma at the age of 8-t. Scto11's .\'ew Light of Alclzymy

Sextus V., Pope, was one of the line of St. Peter accused of

nothing ill their anxiety to blacken his memory by the

Shelta Thari : An esoteric language spoken by the til!kers of
Great Britain, and pO':.Sihly a descendant of an •· inner"
lang112.ge o..mployed by the ancient Celtic Druids or bards.
It was in 1876 that the first hint of the existence of Sltella
Tltari reached the cars of that prince of practic.~I philolo-
gists, Charles Godfre}' Leland. ft seems strange that
Shelta Tharl 3tH
George Borrow had n~\·cr stumbleJ upon the language, and
that fact m:~.y be b.ken a-; a. "stron::: proof of the jealousy
with which the no:na<lic cl?.SSei g:urJed it. Leland relates
how he and Profe>sur E. H. l'.>lmer were \\"anderi:lg on the
beach at Aberystwyth when the}' met a tramp, who heard
them indulging in a conversation in Romany. Leland
questioned the man as to how he gained a living, and he
replied, " Shelkin gallop."."." The words were foreign even
to the master of diale::t, and he inquired their import.
" Why," said the man, " it means selling ferns. That is
tinker's language or minklers' thari. 1 thought as you
knew Romany, you might understand it. The rigl:tt name
for the tinkers' language is Shtdla." "It was," says
Leland, ·• with the feelings of Columbus the night before
he discovered America that I heard the word Shelta, and I
asked the fern-dealer if he could talk it." The man
replied •· A little," and on the spot the philologist collected
a number of words and phra~es from the fern-seller which
gave him sufficient insight into the language to prove to
him that it was absolutely different from Romany. The
Celtic tlrigin of lhe dialect soon began to commend itself
lo Leland, and he attempted to obtain from the man some
verse or jingle in it, possibly for the purpose of observing
i~ syntactical arrangement. But all he was able to drag
from his informant were some rhymes of no philological
value, and he found he had soon pumped the tramp dry.
It was in America that Leland nearly terrified a tinker out
of his wits by speaking to him in the lost dialect. The
man, questioned as to whether he could speak Sheila,
admitted the soft impeachment. He proved to be an
Irishman, Owen 1\Iacdonald by name, and he furnished
Leland with an invaluable list of several hundred words.
But Leland could not be sure upon which of the Celtic
languages the dialect was based. Owen l\Iacdonald
declared to him that it was a fourth language, which had
nothing in common with old Irish, Welsh, or Grelic, and
hazarded the information that it was the idiom of the
" Ould Picts,'' but thC. appears to be rather too conjectural
for the consumption of the philologist. Shelta is not a
jargon, for it can be spoken grammatically without using
English, as in the British form of Romany. Pictish in all
probabtlity was not a Celtic language, nor even anAryan one,.
however intimately it may have been affected by Celtic
speech in the later stages of its existence. Leland's dis-
coverr was greeted in some quarters with inextinguishable
laughter. The Sat"rday Review jocosely suggested that he
had been " sold," and that old Irish had been palmed off on
him for a mysterious lingo. He put this view of the
matter before his tinker friend, who replied with grave
solemnity, ·• And what'd I be afther makm' two languages
av thim for, if there was but wan av thim?" Since
Leland's day much has been done to reclaim this mysterious
tongue, chiefly through the investigations of Mr. John
Sampson and Professor Kuno Meyer. The basis of these
investigations rested on the fact lhat the tinker caste of
Great Britain and Ireland was a separate class-so separate
indeed as almost to form a !ace by itself. For hundreds of
years, possibly, this fraternity existed with nearly all its
ancient characteristics, and on the general disuse of Celtic
speech had conserved it as a secret dialect. The peculiar
thing concerning Shelta is lhe extent of territory over which
it is spoken. That it is known rather extensively in London
itself was discovered by Leland, who heard it spoken by two
small boys in the Euston Road. They were not Gypsies,
and Leland found out that one of them spoke the languag£-
with great fluency. Since Leland's discoveries Sheila has
been to some extent mapped out into dialects, one of the
most important of which is lha~ of Ulster. It would be
difficult to explain in tfte course of such an article as this
exactly how long the Ulster dialect of this strange and
Shelta Thari
ancient tongue differs from th:1.t in use in othrr parts
of Great. Brit.aiu and Ir<'ltuul. But that ii does so is
certain. Kcarly eighteen years a:::o Mr. John S;>.:np<:on, of
Liverpool, a worthy s•J CCC~sor to llorrow and Leland, and
a linguist of repute, collected a number of s:'!yings anrl
proverbs from two old Irish tinkcrs--John Barlow and
Phil Murray-which he distinctly states are in the t:lster
dialect of SJ:ella. Some of these may be quoted to provide
the reader witl1 specimens of lhe l<:.nguage :-Krish gyukem
have muni Sheldru-- Old beggars have good S/.elta. Stimera
dhi-ilsha, s~imcra aga dhi-ilsha-If you're a piper, have
your own pipe. i\Iislo g~nhcs thabcr-The traveller knows

ant isn't an Orangcman. .:\us a dhabjon dhvilsha-The
blessing of God on you. i\lisli, gami gra dhi-il-l:Sc off, and
bad luck to you.
There seems to be considerable reason to believe that
the tinker (or more properly " tinkler ") class of Great
Britain sprang from the remnants of its ancient Celtic
inhabitao1ts, and differed as completely from the Gypsy, or
H.:;many, race as one people can well differ from another.
Th!s is almost conclusively proved by the criterion of
speech, for Slzelta is a Celtic tongue and that Romany is ~­
dialect of Northern Hindustan is not open lo doubt.
Those who now speak Romany habitually almost invariably
make use of Shelta as well, but that only proves that the
two nomadic races, having occupied lhe same territory for
hundreds of years, had gained a knowledge of each other's
languages. Who, then, were the original progenitors of
the tinkers ? Whoever they were, they were a Celtic-
speaking race, and probably a nomadic one. Shelta has
been referred to as the language of the ancient bards of
Ireland. the esoteric tongue of an Irish priesthood. Leland
puts forward the hypothesis lhat the Shelta-speakin,g tinker
is a descendant of a prehistoric guild o£ bronze-workers.
This, he thinks, accounts in part for his secretiveness as
regards his language. In Italy to this very day the tinker
class is identified with the itinerant bronze worker>. The
tinker fratern;ty of Great Britain and Ireland existed ";th
perhaps nearly all its ancient characteristics until the
advent of railroads. But long before this it had probably
amalgamated to a great extent with the Gypsy population,
and the two languages had become common to the two
peoples. This is the only explanation that can be given
for the appearance of Sheila, a Celtic language, in the non-
Celtic portions of Great Britain. That it originated in
Ireland appears to be highly probable, for in no other part
of these islands during the later Celtic period was there a
state of civilisation sufficiently advanced to permit of the
existence of a close corporation of metal-workers possessing
a secret language. Moreover, the affinities of Slzelta appear
to be with old Irish more than with any other Celtic dialect..
There is one other theory that presents itself in connection
with the origin of Sheila, and that is, that it is the modern
descendant of the language of the ·• Ould Picts " men·
tioned by Owen Macdonald, Leland's tinker friend. It
has by no means been proved ,lhat Pictish was a non-Aryan
language, and, despite the labours of Professor Hhys, we
are as far off as ever {(om any definite knowledge concern-
ing the idiom spoken by that my!;tcrious people. But there
arc great difficulties in the way of accepting the hypothesis
of the Pictlsh origin of Sllelta, the chief among them being
its obvious Irish origin. There were, it is known, Picts in
the :Korth of Ireland, but they were almost certainly a
small and barbarous colony, and a very unlikely community
to form a metal-working confraternity, possessing the luxury
of a private dialect. It still remains for the Celtic student
to classify Shelta, It may prove lo be" Pictish," strongiy
influenced by the Gaelic of Ireland and Scotland. A
comparison with Basque and the dialect of the Iberian
Sl!emhamphorash 368 Sibylline Books
tribes of .:llorocco might bring affinittes to light, and thus
establish tha theory of its non-Aryan origin : but itsl
stron3 kinship with Erse seems undoubted. (See journal
of the Gypsy Lore Society, ~ew Series.)
Sbemhamphorasb: In the Talmud, the external term repre-
senting the hidden word of power, by whose virtues it were
po3sible to create a new worl..t. But it is lost to man,
though even sounds approximating to it have a magic
power. and c:1n give to him who pronounces them dominion
in the spirit-world. Some of the Rabbis say that the word
of power contains twelve letleh, others, forty-two, and
yet others !>eventy-two ; but these ue the letters of the
divme alphabet, which God created from certain luminous
poi11ts made by the concentration of the primal universal
Light. Shemhamphorash is, in fact, the name o! this word.

ship approached in a cloud. As it sailed o,·er the roof the

Shorter, Thomas : (S:c Splrltuall;m.)
Siberia : The barbarian tribes of Siberia a ll more or less
practise the art o! Sorcery, and this has been from time
immemorial in the hands o( the shamanistic or medicine-
man class. The SamoyeJs who are idol-worshippers believe
also in tile extstence of an order of invi~ible ·spirits which
they call tadebCscJiS. Tnese are ever circling through
the atmosphere, and are a con:.tant menace to the native,
who i$ anxioul> to propitiate them. This can only be effec·
ted through the inten•ention of a tadibe or Necromancer,
who, when his services are requi~itioned, attires himself in
magical costume of remdecr leather trimmed with red
cloth, a mask of red cloth, and a breast-plate of polished
metal. He then takes a drum of reindeer skin (See Lap-
land) ornamented with bra'>S rings, and attended by an
assistant, walks round in a circle invoking the presence
of the spirits, shalong a large rattle the while. The noise
grow.> louder, and a> tue :.ptrits are supposed to draw near
the sorcerer, he a.dc.lrcs~e:. them, beating his drum more
gently, and paw,ing iu his cnant to listen to their answers.
Graduall>· he ''orks himself into a condition of frenzy, beats
the drum with great violence, anJ appears to be possessed
by the supernatural inilucnce writhing a11d foaming at the
mouth. All at once he stops, and oracularly pronounces
the will of the spirit... The Tadibe's office is a hereditary
one, but if a member of the tnbe should exhibit special
qualifications he is adopted into the priesthood, and by
f.~sts, vigils, the use of narcotics and stimulants in the same
manner as is employed by the ~.A. Indians (q.v.), he
comes to believe th.M he has been visited by the spirits.
He is then adopted as a Tauibe with midnight ceremoinal,
and is invested with a magic drum. A great many of the
tricks of the priesthood are merely those of ordinary con-
juring, such as the rope trick, but some of the illusions
which these men secure are exceedingly striking. With
their hanJs and feel tied together, they sit 001 a carpet of
reindeer ~kin, and putting out the light, summon the
assistance of lhe spirits. Peculiar noises herald their
approach, snakes hiss, and bears growl, the lights are
rekindled and the tad1be is seen released from his bonds.
The Samoyeds sacrifice much to tile dead, and perform
various ceremonies in their honour, but they believe that
only the souls of the tadibes enjoy immortality and hover
through the air, demanding constant sacrifice.
Further to the east, tnh'lbilmg the more northerl:y part
of Siberia dwell the O:,tiaks, who have nominally ~.dopted
the rites of the Greek Church, but magic is riie amongst
them. )!any Ostiaks carry about with them a description
of fetish, which they call Schaila11. Whether this name,
like the Arabic Sltdlau, is merely a corruption of that of
Satan, it would be difficult to say. Larger images of this
kind arc part of the furniture of an Ostiak lodge, but they
are allired in ~even pearl embroidered garments, and sus-
pended to the neck by a string of silver coins. In a strange
sort of dualism they are placed in many of the huts cheek
by jowl with the tmage of the Virgm .:llary. and at meal·
times their lips are smeared with the blood of raw game
or fish.
It is this people, the Ostiaks, with whom the word
" Shaman " originated. These Shamans are merely
medicine-men.
The :'.Iongols, who inhabit the more southern parts of the
great waste of Siberia are al~o ancient practitioners in
sorcery, and rely greatly on di\•ination. Jn order to
discover what description of weather will be prevalent !or
any length of time they employ a ~tone endowed with magic
virtues called yadeh-tasll. Thb is suspended over, or lies
in a b:1sin of water with sundry ceremonies, and appears
to be the same kind of stone in use among the Turcornans
as related by Ibn i\Iohalhal, an early Arab traveller.
The celebrated conqueror, Timur, in his ::'.Iemoirs,
recorus that the Jets resorted to incantations to produce
heavy rain~ which hindered his cavalry from acting against
them. A Ya<lachi, or weather-conjuror, was taken
prisoner, and after he had been beheaded the storm ceased.
B.lbu refers to one of his C.lrly friends, Khwaja ka.
::\Iulai. as conspicuous for his ~>kill in falconry and his
knowledge o! Yadageri, or the science of inducing rain and
snow by me.J.ns of ench~nt~ent. The Russians .were much
distressed by heavy r:\lns m 1552, when bestegmg Kazan,
and universally ascribed the unfavourable weather to the
arts of the Tatar queen, who was an ~n.cbantress. .
Earlv in the 18th century, the Chlnese Emperor Shi·
tsun"' issued a proclamation a~ainst rain-conjuring, address-
ed t~ the Eight Banners of :'.[ong?lia. '' If," .ind!gna~tly
observes the Emperor, "1f I, offenng prayers m s1ncenty,
have yet cause to fear thal it may please heaven to leave
my prayer unanswered, il ts truly intolerable that mere
common people wishing for rain should of their own fancy
set up altars of earth ; and bnng toge_ther a r~bble of
Hoshang (Buddhist Bon:tes) and Taoss1 to conJure the
spirits to gratify their wi~hcs."
Sibylline Books : The manuscripts which embodied the
secrets of human destiny, the worh: of the stbyls (q.v.) or
prophetesses of the ancient world. According to Tacitus,
these books were first preserved in the Capitol. When
it was burnt down, the precious leaves of Fate were.pre-
served, and removed to the temple of Apollo X::alatmus.
Their after-fate is enshrouded in mystery, but tt would
seem that the Cumean books existed until 339 A.D.• when
they were destroyec.l by Stilikon. Augustus .se,nt three
ambassadors-Paulus Gabinus, i\'!arcus OtacJihus, .and
Lucius Valerius-into Asia, Africa, and It.'\ly, but espcctally
to the Erythracan Sibyl. to collect whato-.•er could .be
discovered of the Sibylline Oracles, to replace those '~htch

namely, the books of Lhc elder Sibyls, that is,. of the earlier
Greek and Roman times ; and the later, whtch were much
falsified, ancl dbfigured with numerous .interpol?-tion.s.
Of the latter eiaht books in Greek and Lattn are still sa1d
to be extant. Those which are preserved in Rome had
been collected from various places, at various_ times, and
contained predictions of future events couched m the most
mysterious of symbolic languages. At first they '"ere

Silvester II., Pope, (Gerbert, died 1003) : One of a number of
popes who from the tenth century onwards were regarded
as sorcerers. It was said-and the story probably
emanated from the Gnostics who had been proscribed by
the Church-that Gerbert had evoked a demon who
obtained for him the papacy, and who further oromised
him that he should die only after he had celebrated Hi<>h
Mass in J~rusalem. One day. while he was saying mass'in
a Church m ~orne, he felt suddenly ill, and remembering
that he was m the Church of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem,
he knew that the demon had played him a trick. Before
he died, the chronicler continues, he confessed to his
cardinals his compact with the devil. However, as
Gerbcrt had been preceptor of two monarchs and a friend
of others, it is more likely that he owed his•preference to
-one of these. He was one of the most learned men of his
~ay, a pr~ficicnt in m!lthematics, astronomy, and mechan-
ICS. He 1t was who 1ntroduced clocks, and some writers
~redit him with the invention of arithmetic as we now have
it. It is not a:t all improbable that his scientific pursuits
seemed to the 1gnorant to savour of magic. The technical
lan~~age e~pl.oyed in his various studies might wj:U have
a suuster Significance to the ignorant. The brazen head
w!llch William of _.Malmesbury speaks. of as belonging to
S•lvesler, and which answered quesbons in an oracular
manner probably had its origin in a similar misintcrpreta-
t:!on o.f scientific ap?aratus. But .h~wever that may be,
tnere 1s no lack of p1cturesque detaJI m some of the stories
told of him. By the aid of sorcery he is said to have
discovered buried treasure and to have visited a. marvellous
underground palace, whose riches and splendour vanished
at a touch. His very tomb was believed to possess the
powers of sorcery, and to shed tears when one of the suc-
ceeding popes was about to die.
Simon Ben Yohal: (See Kabala.)
Simon Magus : The sorcerer mentioned in the Xew Testa-
ment (Acts viii.) who bewitched the people of Samaria, and
led them to beheve that he was possessed of divine power.
He was born in Samaria or Cyprus and was among the
number of Samaritans who, moved by the preaching of
Philip, came to him for baptism. Later, when Peter and
john laid their hands on the new converts, so that they
received the Holy Ghost, Simon offered the disciples money
to procure a similar power. Dut Peter sternly rebuked
him for seeking to buy the gift of God with money, and
bade him pray that his evil thought might be forgiven,
whereupon the already repentant Simon said, '' Pray ye
to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have
spoken come upon me."
Though we are not told in detail what the sorceries were
with which Simon bewitched the people of Samaria; certain
early ecclesiastical writers have left a record of his doings.
He could, they averred, make himself invisible when he
pleased, assume the appearance of another person, or of the
lower animals, pass unharmed through fire, cause statues to
become alive, make furniture move without any visible
means of imparting motion, and go through a long list of
equ.ally miraculous performances. In explanation o{ his
des1re to possess the apostles' power of working miracles
h; i~ said to ba.ve affirmed that his sorceries took a great deal
o time. and trouble to perform, owing to the uecessity for
a•.multitude of magical rites and incantations, while the
1lllracles of the apostles were accomplished easily and
successfully, by the mere utterance of a few words. '
The adept. from whom Simo11 learned the art of magic
was one Dos1theus, who pretended to be the Messiah fore-
to!~ by the pro~hets, and who was contemporary with
Chnst. From ttus person he appears to have acquired a
great stor~ of. occult e~u.ditio!l• and ~wed his power chiefly
to th~ hys~ncal cond1t1ons mto which he was capable of
t~rowmg lum~elf. Through these he was enabled to make
hunself look e1ther old or young, returning at will to child-
~ood or.old age. It is evident that be had not been initiated
m~o Transcendental Magic, but was merely consumed by a
thust for power over humanity and the mysteries of
na.ture. Repulsed by the Apostles, he is said to have under-
taken pilgrimage11, like them, in which he permitted himself
to be worshipped by the mob. He declared that he himself
was the manifestation of the Splendour of God, and that
Helena, a Greek slave of his, was its reflection. Thus he
1mitatect Christianity in the reverse sense affirmed the
eternal reign of evil and revolt, and was, in' fact an anti-
christ. '
After a while he went to Rome, where he appeared
before the ~mpcror Nero. He is said to have been decapi-
tated by lum, but hiS head was restored to his shoulders
and he was instituted by the tyrant as court sorcerer:
Legend states that St. Peter, alarmed at the spread of the
doctrine of Simon in Rome, repaired thither to combat it,
that Nero was made aware of his arrival, and imagining
Peter to be a rival sorcerer resolved to bring them together
for his amusement. An account ascribed to St. Clement
states that on the arrival of Peter, Simon flew gracefuJJy
through a window into the outside air. The Apostle gave
vent to a vehement prayer, whereupon the magician, with
a loud cry, crashed to the earth, and broke both his legs.
Nero, greatly annoyed, immediately imprisoned the saint,
and it is related that Simon died of his faU. He had, how-
ever, founded a distinct school headed by Merrander,
which promised immortality of soul and body to its
followers. As late as 1858 there existed iu France and
America a sect whichcredited the principles of this magician.
Slradz, Count of : (See Dee.)
Sixth Sense : A term used to denote the faculty of spiritual
perception, which is distinct from, and higher than, the five
physical senses. It is the possession of the medium, the
psychic or sensitive, and in some measure of all hypnotic
subjects. lt is not properly a separate sense at all, but is
compounded from the spiritual correlates of the physical
senses.
Slade, Henry ! An American medium, principally known
in connection with his slate-writing C""Pioits. He Cl!.me to
Britain in July, 1876, and was cordially received by the
leading spintualists. Very many people were impressed
and completely mystified by the phenomena they witnessed
at his seances, and Lord Rayleigh, at a meeting of the
British Association in September, r876, state(! that he had
attended a s6ance of Slade's in the company of a professional
conjurer, and that the latter had failed entirely to find an
expll!.nalion of the facts. A few days after this emphatic
testimony was given, however, Professor Ray Lankester
published in a letter to the Times the result of a s6ance at
which he and Dr. Donkin were present. lie had, he said,
snatched the slate prematurely from ·• Dr." Slade' s hand,
and had found a message written thereon, thougb the sound
of writing had not then been heard. The spiritualists main·
tained that the '· exposure " was no exposure at all, since
Slade declared that he had heard the spirits writing, and
Slate-Writing

had mentioned the fact, but that his voice ''lad ~en lo~t ~n
the confusion. However, the medium's career m Bntam

·m risonment with hard labour. He. appeal~d•. an~ the

Professor i'..Ollner did not succeed m hts atten:pt to ha~e
knots ti:ed in a piece of bladder, or to have two.nngs of solid
,.,00d interlaced. In short, no really coJttll.'swe ~roof was
obtained. In 1884 Slade's pheno~ena.was mvestigated ?Y
a committee appointed by the Uruverstty of Pennsylvarua.
The results of the latter investigation wer~, at the best, of a
negative description. (See also Slate·wnt\ng,.) .. . .
Slate•writing : A form of the so-called • dtrect spmt
writing, or autography, which has alw~ys been one of the
most popular phenomena of the seance. The modus
operandi is the same in the majority of cases. The medmm
and the sitter take their seats at opposite end~ of a small
table, each grasping a corner of an ord~nary school slate,
which they thus hold firmly pressed agamst the ~n~ers1de
of the table. A small fragment of slate-pcnctl ts first
enclosed between slate and table, for tbe usc of the suppo~d
spirit-writer. Should the seana be successful, a scrntchmg
sound. as of someone writing on a sl!lte~ is heard at the ~nd
of a few moments. three loud raps mdtcate the conclu~1o.n
of the message, and on the withdrawal of the slate, tt ts
found to be partly covered with writing-either a gene_ral
mess:\ge from the spirit-world,or an answer to some question
perviously written down by the sttter. . .
Among the mediums ~.-ho were most successful m obtam-
ing spirit writing in this manner ~vere Dr. ;>lade and Mr.
Eglinton. The former, an Ame~tcan m~dt_um, came to
England in 1876, and suc~eeded 111 ~ysttfymg n~t a. f~w
men oi education and of sctcnttfic attautruents. Hts cnttcs
have attributed his success, in part at least, to his frank and
engaging manner, which did much to disarm suspicious
sitters. However, ere long Professor Ray Lankester
exposed his trickery, though the exposure was regarded by
many as inconclusive, and "Dr." Henry Slade was prose-
cuted. Tbourrh sentenced to three months' hard labour,
the omission ~f certain words in the accusation made the
conviction of no effect. But Dr. Slade found that England
bad become too hot for him, and speedtly retired whence
he had come. ::\!any of the accounts of his seauces in
different countries are of interest, chiefly because of the dis-
crepancy which exists between those of credulous spiritual·
ists and those of trained investigators. Dr. Hichard
Hodgson, however, has pointed out that even in the latter
class instances of mal-observation are the rule rather than
the exception, particularly where sleight of hand plays a
prominent part in the exhibition. A worthy successor to
Slade was William Eglinton, who acted as medium for
slate-writing manifestations, and attained to an extraordin-
ary popularity, upwards of a hundred people testif};ng to
his mediumistic powers in the spiritualist journal Ltght.
Speaking of his performances. l\lr. C. C. ::\lassey said,
" ::\lany. of whom I am one, are of the opinion that the
case for these phenomena generally, and for autography,
in parlicular, is already complete." Rglinton's manifest~­
tions were produced in full light, d.nd his seances were
seldom blank, so it is hardly surprising that very many
persons, ignorant of the lengths to which conjuring can
be carried, and over-confident in their own ability to
observe correctly, should see in slate-wriht~g a phenomenon
explicable only by a spiritualistic theory. But there was
definite proof of fraud in several cases. Muslin and a false
beard, part of the make-up of a " spirit " had been found
in Eglinton's portmanteau, various persons averred that
they had seen his messages written on prepared slates
previous to the seana, and he had been concerned in other
matters o! an equally doubtful character. And though
these detections also were disputed they left in the unbiassed
mind but little doubt of the fraudulent nature of Eglinton's
mediumship.
Spiritualists theiOSelves admitted that fraud might
occasionally be practised by genuine mediums, owing to the
uncertainty of the " power." Particularly was this so in
the case of professional mediums, who were obliged to pro-
duce some results, and who had to resort to trickery when
other means failed them. l\tr. S. J. Davey, an associate
of the Society for Psychical Research who, having discov-
ered the tricks of slate-writing, practised them himself, 'vas
claimed by certain spiritualists as a medium as well as a
conjurer, and that notwithstanding his protestations to the
contrary. This is undoubtedly a powerful argument
against the good faith of slate-writi11g. If his sitters could
mistake these sleight-of-hand tricks-which l\!r. Davey
practised with the express purpose o£ discrediting their
pro~ssional mediums-fo! genuine spirit manifestations,
might they not also be misled by tbc legerdemain of Slade
and Eglinton, and other well-known mediums ? It has
been objected that even skilled conjurers such as " Pro-
fessor" Hoffmann and Houdin professed theiOSelves
mystified by slate-writing performances, but the answer is
fairly obvious, that quite a clever conjurer may be baffled
by the pedorrnances of a brother-expert. The methods
adopted by Mr. Davey were of a simple nature, requiring
little or no apparatus. In the case of a long, general
!llessage. he would prepare a slate beforehand, and substi-
tute it for the test slate. A shorter message, or a reply to a
question, he would write on the reverse side of the slate.
with a scrap of pencil fastened in a thimble, and so with-
draw the slate that the side written on would be uppermost.
There is reason to believe that like simple devices were used
in other seances, for their very simplicity, and the absence of
all apparatus, rendered them particularly difficult of
detection. But where the sitters were more credulous,
intricate furniture and appliances were used, and the most
elaborate preparations made for the stance. (See Pope
John XXII.)
Slavs : The Slavonic races have an extenstve demonology.
and in some measure their religious pantheon appears to
have been in a stage between animism (q.v.) and polythe-
ism, that ts between god, and spirit-worshtp. Among them
all witchcraft, fairy and folk-lore rest mainly in a belief
in certo.in spirits of nature, which in some measure recall
the pncumatology of Paracelsus and the CQmte de Gabalis.
•· In the vile," says Dr. Krauss, ··also known as Samovile.
Samodivi, and Vilivrjaci, we have ncar relations to the
foresL ;;.nd field spirits or the wood and moss-folk of Middle
Germany, France and Bavaria the ·• wild people of Hesse,
Eifel, Salzburg and the Tyrol, the wood-women and wood-
men of Bohemia, the Tyrolese Fanggen, Fanken, Korkel
and Happy Ladies, the Roumanish Orken, Euguane, and
Dialen, the Danish Ellekoner, the Swedish Skogsnufv<!.z, and
the Rug,;ian Ljesje, while in certain respects they have
affinity with the Teutonic Valkyries." They arc, howc,·er,
more like divme beings, const.·mtly watching over and con-
trolling the destinies of men. They are prnyed to or
exorcised on all occasions. In short their origin is cer-
tainly Shamatlistic. Says Leland : " \Ve can still find
the dla as set forlh in old ballads, the incarnation of
beauty and power, the benevolent friend of sufferers, the
geniuses of heroes, the dwellers by rock and river and
Slavs 371 Societies of Harmony
greenwood tree. But they arc implacable m their wrath
to <!.11 who deceke lhem, or who break a promise. :Xay,
they inflict terrible punishment e,·cn on those who disturb
their rings, or the dances which they make l>y midsummer
moonlight. Hence the proverb applied to any man who
;uddenly fell ill, ' he stepped on a fairy ring.' " (See
Circles.)
There arc three varieties of witches or spirits among the
southern Slavs, the Zracne vile, or aerial spirits, evilly dis-
posed to human beings. and inflicting serious injuries uron
them, \Vill-'o-the-wisps, who lead people astray by nights;
the Poeem11e vile, companionable spirits, who give sage
counsel to mankind, and dwell in the earth : and the
Podovue t•ile, or water sprites, kindly to man on shore, but
treacherous to a degree on their o·wn clement. Another
water·spirit is the Likllo, the Slavonic Polyphemus, a dread
and terrible monster, the Leshy is a wood-demon, Xorka
is tile frightful Lord of the Lower World, and Koschei is a
description of ogre whose province is the abduction of
princesses.
rYitchcrajt.-The witch is very frequently mentioned
in !Slavonic folk-tales, especially among the southern Slavs.
She is called vjcstica, (masculine vustae) meaning originally
"the knowing" or " well-informed one," Viedma
(Russian). In Dalmatia and elsewhere among the Southern
Sla:Js the witch is called Krstaca, " the crossed " in allusion
to the idea that she is of the horn~d race of Hell. It
enrages the witches so much to be called by this word that
when they hear that any one has used it they come to his
house by night and tear him in four pieces, which they cast
to the four winds of heaven, and drive away all his cattle
and stock. Therefore the shrewd farmers of the country
call the witch hmana zena, or •· Common woman." There
arc many forms of Slavonic witch, however, and the
Ljcslica dulers from the macio11ica and the latter from the
Zlukob:tica, or •· evil-meetcr," one whom it is unlucky to
encounter in the morning, or possesses the evil eye. A
Serbian authority says : " I have often heard from old
Hodzas and Kadijas that every female Wallach as soon as
she is forty years old, abandons the '' God be with us," and
becomes a witch (v;cstica) or at least a zlokobnica or maci-
onica. A real witch has the mark of a. cross under her nose,
a zlokob11ica has some hairs of a beard, and a tnacionica may
be known by a forehead full of dark folds wtih blood-spots
in her face."
ln South Slavonian countries the peasants on St. George's
Dav adorn the horns of the cattle with garlands to protect
thc'm from witches. They attach great importance to a
seventh or a twelfth child, who, they believe, arc the great
protectors of the world against witchcraft. :Hut th~c are
in great danger on St. John's Eve, for then the wttches,
having the most power, attack them with stakes or the
stumps of saplings, for which reason the peasantry care-
fully remove cver}rthing of the kind from the ground
in the autumn season. The Krstnik, or wizards, notori-
ously attract the vila ladies, who in most instances are
desirous of becoming their mistresses, just as the women-
kind of the salamanders desire to mate with men. (See
the Cmiosa of Heinrich Kornmann, x666.) The man who
gains the Jove of a vita is supposed to he extremely lucky.
The Slavs believe that on St. George's Day the witches
climb into the steeples of churches with the object of
getting the grease from the axle of the bell, which, for some
reason, they prize exceedingly. Transformation stories
are fairly common, too, in Slavonic folklore, which proves
that this was a form of magic employed by the witches of
these countries. The belief in vampires is an outstanding
superstition in Slavonic countries, and its connections are
fully discussed in the article Vampire.
Slawensik Poltergeist: ln the winter of 1806-7 Councillor
Hahn and an officer named Charles Kern, living for the
time in the Castle of Salwcnsik, Silesia, were disturbed by
curious happenings which suggested that the Castle was
haunted. Strange noises were heard, small objects were
seen to rise from the table and fly through the room. The
only account is by Councillor Hahn, and, as is generally the
case in such circumstances, the most surprising occurrences
were not witnessed by the recorder, but were told him by
his friends. Thus Kern is said to have seen in the glass the
apparition of a woman in white ; while Hahn was not
present when a jug of beer was raised from the table by
invisible hands, tilted, and its contents poured down an
invisible throat.
Sleeping Preacher : Rachel Baker, known as the Sleepi:~g
Preacher, was born at Pelham, Massachusetts, in 1794.
\Vhen she was nine years old her parents removed to Mar-
cellus, N.Y. As a child she had a religious training, her
parents being devout people, and she early manifested a
strong conviction of her sinfulness. In 18n she showed
symptoms of somnambulism, in which she seemed stricken
with horror and despondency. But gradually her mind
became calmer, and delivered discourses of singular clear-
ness, marked by a devout and solemn tone. These fits of
somnambulism, or trance- speaking, seized her regularly
every day, and soon became habitual. She began and
concluded her devotional exercises with prayer, between
which came the discourse. Then a state of apparent
physical distress supervened, and sobs and groans shook
her !raCle. At length the paroxysm passed, and she
subsided into a natural sleep. Change of scene did not
affect these exercises, but the administration of opium
would interrupt them. Her trance discourses were after-
wards published.

Smith Helene : The nom-de-gtterre of a trance medium who
came under the observation of Professor Flournoy. Born
about 1863, at the age of twenty-nine she joined a spiritual-
ist circle and soon developed powerful mediumistic faculties.
In 1894 M. Jllournoy\vas admitted to the circle and thence-
forward examined with much interest the clairvoyance and
trance impersonations of Helbze. In the winter of 189.1she
purported to have visited, during trance, the planet 1\fars,
and many of her trance discourses after that date contain
descriptions of Martian life--manners, dress, scenery. At
length she claimed to have learned the language of the
sister-planet, and this language she spoke with fluency and
consistency. (See Martian Language.) Professor Flournoy
howc,·cr, found no evidence sufficient to justify any belief in
a supernormal faculty, unless it be telepathy.
Smith, Joseph: (See America, U.S. of.)
Sneezing, Superstitions Relating to : It is said that the
custom of blessing one who sneezes originated in It~ly in
the time of Gregory the Great, during a pestilence which
proved mortal to those who sneezed. A still older date
is given to this custom by some writers, who state that
s•Jeezing was fatal from the time of Adam to that of Jacob,
when the latter begged that its fatal effects might be
removed. On his request being granted, the people grate-
fully instituted the custom ·of saluting the sneezer. In
some diseases s11eezing was a bad, in others a good omen.
Sneezi11g to the right was lucky, to the left, unlucky : from
noon to midnight good, from night to noon, bad. St.
Austin says that the ancients would return to bed if 'they
sneezed while putting on a shoe.

Solanot, Viscount: (See Spain.)
Solar Deity : (See Theosophy.)
Solar System; Theosophists have special doctrines as. to the
formation of solar systems. They start by postulatmg the
existence of aU pervading ether, or, as it is termed in occult
chemistry (q.v.) lwilol', an eth:er which is quite i~percepti­
b!e to ordinary senses and mdeed even ~o cla•rv?ya~ts
except the most highly-developed. It_ JS,. desp~te 1ts
diffusion of extreme dens1ty. The Detty mtendmg to
create a'universe invests this ether with his divine force,
whereupon it becomes the constituent of ?latter i~ the
shape of minute dro~s or bubbles, _and of th1s_ the uruverse
with its solar systems 1s formed. F1rst a mass 1s aggregated
by the appropriate agitation ?f these drops. and to this
mass is imparted a rotatory mot•on. T~e ma~s thus formed,
of course contains the matter from whtch w1lllJe formed all
the seve~ worlds, the existence of which Theosophy teaches,
and it may be well here to observe that these worlds are
not separate in the manner we usually conceive separate
worlds to be, but inter-penetrate each other. The sub-
stance in its original form is of the texture of the first
world, and in order to create the texture of the second-
and lower-world the Deity sets up a vast number of
rotatory agitations into each of which is collected 49
atoms arranged in a certain way, sufficient of the _first atom
having been left to form the first world. Th•_s process
continues six times, the atoms of the succeeding lower
worlds ueing formed from tho~e of the world immediately
higher and each time of a multiple of 49 atoms. Gradually
and with the passing of long ages, the aggregation, which
contains the atoms of all seven worlds completely inter-
mingled, contracts and becomes more closely knit until it
forms a nebula which eventuall}' attains the fiat, circular
form familiar to students of astromony. Towards the
centre it is much more dense than at the fringes, and in the
process of flattening and because of the initial revolving
motion, rings are fo:omed encircling the centre. From
these rings the planets are formed, and after the further
passing of ages, it is possible for h01man life to exist on
them. The various worlds as has been said, penetrate
each other substantially within the same bol\nds, the
exceptions being the worlds of finer texture which extend
beyond those relatively more dense. The names of the
worlds are : the first which has not as yet been experienced
by roan-the Divine ; tlle second, the l\·lonadic whence
come the impulses that form man ; the third, the Spiritual,
the highest world which man has as yet been able to
experience : the fourth, the Intuitional, the fifth, the
Mental ; the sixth, the Emotional (Astral) world ; and the
seventh is the world of matter as matter is familiar to us.

Solomon : The connection of Solomon, son of David, the
King of Israel, with magical practice, although it does not
possess any Biblical authority, has yet a very considerable
body of oriental tradition behind it. It is supposed,
however, that the Jewish Solomon has in many cases been
confounded with a still older and mythical figure. Then
the Arabs and Persians have legends of a prehistoric race
who were ruled by seventy-two monarchs of the name of
Suleiman, of whom the last reigned one thousand yea.rs.
"It does not seem," says Yarker, " that these Suleimans
who arc par excellence the rulers of al~ Djinn, Afreets and
other elemental spirits, bear any relationship to the
Israelite King." The name, he says. is found in that of a
god of the Babrlonians and the late Dr. Kenealy, the
tranc;later of Hafiz, says that the earliest Aryan teachers
were named :"\fohn, Bodies or Solymi, and that Sulciman
was an ancient title of royal power, synonymous with
" Sultan " or " Pharaoh." A Persian legend states that in
the mountains of Kaf, which can only be reached by the
magic ring of Solomon, there is a gallery built by the giant
Arzeak. where one kept the statues of a race who were
ruled by the Suleiman or wise Kings of the East. The~e
is a great chair or throne of Solomon hewn out of the solid
rock, on the confines of the Afghanistan and India called the
Takht-i-Suleiman or throne of Solomon, its ancient Aryan
name being Shanker Acharga. It is to these olderSuleiman's
then, that we must probably look for a connection with
the tradition of occultism, and it is not unlikely that the le-
gend relating to Solomo1z and his te~ple have been confused
with these, and that the protagonistsof the antiquity ofFree-
masonry, who date their cult from the building of Solomon's
Temple, have confounded some still older rite or mystery
relating to the ancient dynastyof Suleiman with the circum-
stances of the masonic activities of the Hebrew monarch.
" God," says Josephus, " enabled Solomon to learn that
skill which expels d;emons, which is a science useful and
sanative to men. He composed such incantations, also,
b}' which distempers are alleviated, and he left behind
him the manner of using exorcisms, by which they drive
away docmons, so that they never return. And this
method of cure is of great force unto this day; for I have
seen a certain man of my own country, whose name was
Eleazar, releasing people that were dremoniacal, in the
presence of Vcspasian and his sons, and his captains, and
the whole multitude of his soldiers. The manner of the
cure was this. He put a ring that had a root of one of
these sorts mentioned by Solomon to the nostrils ; and
when the man fell down immediately, he adjured him to
return unto him no more, making stiU mention of So/omo,.,
and reciting the incantations which he composed. And
when Eleazar would persuade and demonstrate to the
spectators that he had such a power, he set, a little way off,
a cup, or basin full of water, and commanded the d<!!mon
as he went out of the man, to overturn it, and thereby to
let the spectators know that he had left the man." Some
pretended fragments of these conjuring books of Solomon
are noticed in the" Codex Pseudepigraphus " of Fabricius,
and Josephushimself hasdescribedone of the antid;emoniacal
roots, which must remind the reader of the perils atten-
dant on gathering the " mandrake.''
The Koran alleges that Solomqn bad power over the
winds, and that he rode on his throne throughout the
world during the day, and the wind brought it back every
night to jerusalem. This throne was placed on a carpet
of green silk, of a prodigious length and breadth, and
sufficient to afford st::.nding-room to all Solomon's army. the
men on his right hand and the Jinn on his left. An army
of the most bcatiful birds hovered near the throne, forming
a kind of canopy over it, and the attendants, to screen the
king and his soldiers from the sun. A certain number of
Solomon 373 Sortilege
evil spirits were also made subject to him, whose business
it was to dive for pearls, and perform other work. Vve are
also informed, on the same authority, that the devils,
having received permission to tempt Solomon, in which
they were not successful, conspired to ruin his character.
They wrote several books of magic, and hid them under
his throne ; and when he died they told the chief men
a:nong the Jews that if they wished to ascertain the manner
in which Solomon obtained his absolute power over men,
Genii, and the winds, they should dig under his throne.
They did so anu founcl the books, abounding '"ith the mvst
impious superstitions. The more learned and enlightened
refused to participate in the practices described in those
books, but tltey were willingly adopted by the common
people. The Mahomed?ns assert that the Jewish priests
published this scandalous story concerning So/omen, which
was believed till Mahomet, by God's command, declared
him to have been no idolater.
Solomon, it is further maintained by the Mahomedans,
brought a thousand horses from Damascus and othe1·
cities he conquered, though some say they were left to him
by his father David, who seized them from the Amalekites;
and others pretend that they came out of the Red Sea, and
were provided with wings. The King wished to inspect his
horses, and ordered them to be paraded before him ; and
their symmetry and beauty so much occupied his attention
that he gazed on them after sunset, and thus neglected
evening prayers till it was too late. When sensible of his
omission, he was so greatly concerned at it that he ordered
all the horses to be killed as an offering to God, except a
hundred of the best of them. This, we are informed,
procured for him an ample recompense, as be received for
the loss of his horses dominion over the winds.
Solomon, Mirror of : The method of making the Mirror of
Solomon, which is used fat· purposes of divination, is as
follows : Take a shining and well-polished plate of fine
steel, slightly concave, and with the blood of a white
pigeon inscribe at the four corners the names-Jehovah,
Eloym, :1-letatron. Adonay. Place the mirror in a clean and
white cloth, and when you behold a new moon during the
first hour after sunset, repeat a prayer that the angel
Anael may command and ordain bis companions to act
as they are instructed ; that is, to assist the operator in
di>·ining from the mirror. Then cast upon burning coals a
suitable perfume, at the same time uttering a prayer.
Repeat this thrice, then breathe upon the mirror and evoke
the angel Anael. The sign of the cross is then made upon
the operator and upon the mirror for forty-five days in
succession-at the end of which period Anael appears in the
form of a beautiful child to accomplish the operator's
wishes. Sometimes he appears on the fourteenth day,
according to the devotion and fervour of the operator.
The perfume used in evoking him is saffron.

Somnambulism : (Latin, somttus, sleep, and amb!'lare, to
walk.) The condition in which walking, talking, and
actions of a more complicated character are performed
during sleep, without the agent's consciousness or after
recollection. The somnambulist may have his eyes closed,
and cars deaf to auditory impressions or sen_se impression~.
without waking in him any gleam of con:;c10usness.. This
may have some effect in rousing new trains of assoctabon
and suggesting a new line of action. It is suggested that
the sleep-walker may see only a mental pict~re !lf what. he
is doing-that is, a dream-and not the obJecttve reality,
and certain experimental tests have proved that this occurs
in some cases at least. Som11ambulism admits of many
varying degrees. Its mildest form is typified in th? inarti.cu-
late murmurings or vague gestures of a dreammg child.,
while in the most extreme cases where all the senses are
active, and the actions apparently as purpo:;iye as in the
normal waking state, it borders on the condition of.spon-
taneous hypnotism. Indeed its affinity with hypnoSIS was
early recognised, when the hypnotic subjec~s of the mag-
netists were designated sonmambules. It IS remarka~le
that somnambulists may walk in dangerous paths With
perfect safety, but if they arc suddenly a~aken.ed they
are liable to fall. Spontaneous somnambulum generally
indicates some morbid tendency of the nervous system,
since, as a rule, only in some abnormal state could t~e
dream ideas exercise so exciting an in6uence on the bra10
as to rouse to activity centres normally controlling volun-
The following tradition is narrated by the :'liahomedan
commentators relative to the building of the temple of
Jerusalem. According to them, David laid the foundations
of it, and when he died he left it to be finished by Solomon.
That prince employed }inn, and not men, in the work ; and
this idea might probably originate from what is said in the
First Book of Kings (vi., 7) that the Temple was ·• built of
stone, made ready before it was brought thither, so that
there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron,
hCdrd in the house while it was building " ; and the Rabbins
notice a worm which, they pretend, assisted the workmen,
the power of which was such as to cause the rocks and
stones to separate in chiselled blocks. Solomon, while
engaged in the erection of the Temple, found his end
approaching, and he prayed that his death utigbt be con-
cealed from the Jinn till the building was finished. His
request was granted. He died while in the'act of praying,
and leaning on his staff, which supported his body in that
posture for a whole year, and the ]inn, who supposed him
to be still alive, continued their work. At the expiration of
the year the edifice was completed, when a worm which
had entered the staff, ate it through, and to the amazement
even of the )inn the body fell to the ground, and the King
was discovered to be dead.

Sorcery : (From Latin sorliarius, one who practices dtvma-
tion by lots.) The use of supposed supernatural power
by the agency of evil spirits called forth by spells by a
witch or black magician. (See Magic.)
The inhabitants of the valley of Lebanon believe that
the celebrated city and temple of Baalbcc were erected by
the }inn under Solomon's direction. The object of the
erection of Haalbec is variously stated, one tradttion affirm-
ing tl!at it was intenueu to be a residence for the Egyptian
princess whom Solomon married, and another that it was
built for the Queen of Sheba.
Solomon Ibn Gablrol (1021-1058) : Spanish-Hebrew poet
and mystic philosopher. He was a Neoplatonist, but at
the same time subscribed to the mystical doctrine which
states that the Deity can only be regarded as a negation of
all attributes. This he considered essential to the preser-
vation of the Jewish monotheism.
Sorrel-leaf : A sorrel-leaf was sometimes used to .bewit~h
people, as in the case of the Irish Witch ~enboned to
George Sinclair's Satan's l11visib!e World DJsplay~d, who
gave to a girl a leaf of sorrel, which the ~hild put 1nto he~
mouth. Great torture ensued for the chtld, such tortures
being increased on the approach of the witch. .
Sortilege, or divination uy lots, ts one of the most anc1ent
and common superstitions. We find it used amoug the
Oriental nations to detect a guilty person, as_ when Sa';!l
by this means discovcre•J that Jonathan had d1.sobeyed his
command by taking food,. anu when the sa1lors by a
similar process found Jonah to be the cause! of the t~n1pest
by which they were overtaken. The methods of usmg the
lot have been very numerous, such as .Rhabdomancy,
Clidomancy, the Sortes Sagittari;e, otherwise Belomancy,
Sortilege 374 Spain
and the common casting of dice. The following are the
more cla~ical :-
Sortes Thri:ec:e, or Thri:ean lots, were chiefly used in
Greece ; they were pebbles or counters distinguished by
certain characters which were cast into an urn, and the
first that came out was supposed to contain the right
direction. This form of divination received its name from
the Thri;e, three nymphs supposed to have nursed Apollo,
and to have·invented this mode of predicting futurity.
Sortes Vialcs, or street and road lots, were used both
in Greece and Rome. The person that was desirous to learn
his fortune carried with him a certain number of lots,
distinguished by several characters or inscriptions, and
walking to and fro in the public ways desired the first
boy whom he met to draw, and the inscription on the lot
thus drawn was received as an infallible prophecy. Plut-
arch declares that this form of divination was derived
from the Egyptians. by whom the actions and words of
boys were carefully observed as containing in them some-
thing prophetical. Another form of the Sortcs Viales was
exhibited by a boy, but sometimes by a man, who posted
himself in a public place to give responses to all comers.
He was provided with a tablet, on which certain fatidical
verses were written ; when consulted, he cast dice on the
tablet, and the verses on which they fell were supposed
to contain the proper direction. Sometimes instead of
tablets they bad urns, in which the fatidical verses were
thrown, written upon slips, of parchment. The verse
drawn out was received as a sure guide and direction.
To this custom Tibullus alludes:-
Thrice in the streets the sacred lots she threw,
And thrice the boy a happy omen drew.
This form of divining was often practised with the
Sibylline oracles, and was be6ce named Sortes Sibyllina.
Sortes Prcnestin:e, or the Prenestine lots-, were used in
Italy; the letters of the alphabet were placed in an urn
and shaken: they were then turned out upon the floor,
and the words which they aceidenta.lly formed were
received as omens. This superstitious use of letters is still
common in Eastern nations. The Mussulmans have a
divining table, which they say was invented by the prophet
Edris or Enoch. It is divided into a hundred little squares,
each of which contains a letter of the Arabic alphabet.
The person who consults it repeats three times the opening
chapter of the Koran, and the 57th verse of the 6th chapter :
" \:Vith Him are the keys of the secret things ; none
knoweth them but Him ; He knoweth whatever is on the
dry ground, or in the sea : there falleth no leaf but He
knoweth it ; neither is there a single grain in the dark
parts of the earth, nor a green thing, nor a dry thing. but
it is written in a perspicuous book." Having concluded
this recitation, he averts his head from the table and
places his finger upon it ; he then looks to see upon what
letter his finger is placed, writes that letter ; the fifth
following it; the fifth following that again; and so on
UJltil be comes back to the first he had touched : the
letters thus collected form the answer.
Sortes Homeric:e and Sorles Virgilia.n:e, divination by
op~ning some pocrn at hazard, and accepting the passage
wh1ch first turns up a.s a.n answer. This practice probably
arose from the esteem which poets had among the ancients,
by whom they were reputed divine and inspired persons.
Homer's works among the Greeks had the most credit, but
the traged_ies of Euripides and other celebrated poems
w~re OCcasionally used for the same purpose. The Latins
Ch1efiy consulted Virgil, and many curious coincidences are
related by grave historians, between the prediction and
the event ; thus, the elevation of Severus to the empire is
supposed to have been foretold by his opening at tbis
verse-
Remember, Roman, with imperial sway
to rule the nations.
It is said that Charles I. and Lord Falklana made trial of
the Virgilian lots a little before the commencement of the
great civil war. The former opened at that passage in
the fourth book of the JEncid where Dido predicts the
violent death of her faithless lover ; the latter at the
lamentation of Eva.nder over his son in the eleventh book ;
if the story be true, tbe coincidences between the responses
and events arc amon~ the most J;Cmarkable recorded.
Sortcs Biblic:e, divma.tion by the Bible, which the early
Christians used instead of the profane poets. Nicephorus
Gregoras recommends the Psalter as the fittest book for
the purpose, but Cedrenus informs us that the New Testa-
ment was more commonly used. St. Augustine denounces
this practice in temporal affairs, but declares in one of
his letters that he had recourse to it in all cases of spiritual
difficult[. Another form of the Biblical lots is to go to a.
place o worship, and take a.s an omen the first passage
of Scripture read by the minister, or the text from which
he preaches. This is no uncommon practice ir. modern
times, and it is frequently vindicated by persons who ought
to know better.
The Mussulmans consult the Koran in a similar manner,
but they deduce their answer from the seventh line of the
right-hand page. Others count how often the letters
kha and shin occur in the page; if kha (the first letter of
kheyr, " good") predominate, the answer is deemed
favourable ; but if shin (the first letter of shin " evil ") be
more frequent, the inference is that the projects of the
inquirer are forbidden or dangerous.
It would be casv to multiply examples of these efforts
to obtain guidance from blind chance ; they were once
so frequent, that it was deemed necessary to denounce
them !rom the pulpit as being clearly forbidden by the
divine precept, •· Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."

Spain : WitchcrafJ.-From early times Spain was regarded as
the special abode of superstition, and in the middle ages
a.s the home of sorcery and magic, probably because of
the immense notoriety given to the discoveries of the
Moorish alchemists. (See l!loors.) The Inquisition quickly
took root in the country, and reaped a rich harvest among
Jews, Moriscos, and superstitious Christians.
Alfonso de Spina, a Fra~ciscan of Castille, where the
Inquisition was not then established, wrote, about the year
1458 or 1460, a work especially directed against heretics
and unbelievers, in which he gives a chapter on these
articles of popular belief which were derived from the
ancient heathendom of the people. Among these, witches,
under the name of Xurgume (jurgina) or bruxe, held a
prominent place.
He tell~ us ·that in his time these offenders abounded in
Da.uphiny and Gascony, where they assembled in great
numbers by night on a wild table land, carrying candles
with tQem, to worship Satan, who appeared in the form
of a boar on a. certain rock, popularly known by the name
Elboch de Biterrie, and that many of them had been taken
by the inquisition o£ Toulouse and burnt. Fn:>m that
time we find, in Spanish
' history, the charge o! Wltcbcraft
and sorcery not infrequently brought forward under
different forms and circumstances, of which several remark-
able examples arc given by Llorente in his Hi.~ll>ry of tM
Inquisition in Spain.
The first auto·da-!6 against sorcery appears to have been
that of Ca.lahorra., in 1.507, when thirty women, charged
before the inquisition "-" witches, were burnt. In 1527, a
great number of women were a.~uscd in. Navarre of _the
practice of sorcery, through tbc mformabon ef twe guls,
Spain 375 Spain
one of eleven, the other only of nine years old, who con-
fessed be~ore t~e royal council of Navarre that they had
been rc<?C~ved mto. the sect of the jurginas, and promised
on condtb?n o~ bewg pardoned, to discover all the women
who were 1mphcated in these practices.
The moment. the attention of the inquisition was thus
d£?1~ to the enme of sorcery, the prevalence of this super-
stition 10 the Basque provinces became notorious ; and
Charles V., ~ghtly judging that it was to be attributed
more to the tgnorance of the population of those districts
than to any other cause, directed that preachers shoul~ be
sent to instruct them.
The first treatise in' the Spanish language on the subject
of sorcery, by a Franciscan monk named )1artin de Ca.s-
ta.naga, w~s printed under approbation of the bishop of
Calahorra 10 1529. About this time the zeal of the inquisi-
to.rs of Saragossa wa~ excited by the appearance of many
Wttches who were satd to have come from Navarre, and
to have been sent by their sect as missionaries to make
disciples of the women of Arragon. This sudden witch-
-persecution in Spain appears to have had an influence on
the fate of the witches of Italy. Pope Adrian IV., who
was raised to the papal chair in 1522, was a Spanish bishop,
.and had held the office of inquisitor-general in Spain. In
the time of Julius ll., who r uled the papal world Irorn 1503
to 1513, a sect of witches and sorcerers had been discovered
in Lombardy, who were extremely numerous, and had their
Sabbaths and all the other abominations of the continental
witche~. The proceedings against them ~pear to have
been lundered by a dispute between the inquisitors and the
ecclesiastical judges who claimed the jurisdiction in such
cases. On the zoth July, 1523, pope Adrian issued a bull
against the crime of sorcery, placing it in the sole juris-
diction of the inquisitors. This bull perhaps gave the new
impulse to the prosecution of the witches in Spai11.
Of the cases which followed during more than a century,
the most remarkable was that of the auto-da-te at Logrono
on the 7th and 8th of November, 1610, which arose in some
measure from the visitation of the French Basque province
in the preceding year. The valley of Ba.stan is situated
at the foot of the Pyrenees, on the French Frontier, and
at no great distance from La.bourd. It ·was within the
jurisdiction of the i.tquisition established at Logrono in
Castille. The mass of the population of this valley appear
to have been sorcerers, and they held their meetings or
Sabbaths at a place called Zuganamurdi.
Awoman whowc:.scondemned implicated a number ofother
persons. All the persons arrested on this occasion agreed
in their description of the Sabbath, and of the practices of
the witches, which in their general features bore a close
resemblance to those of the witches of La.bourd. The
usual place of meeting was known here, as in Labourd, by
the popular name of Aquelarre, a Gascon word, signifying
the meadow of the goat. Their ordinary meetings were
held on the nights of Monday, Wednesday and Friday,
every week, but they had grand feasts on the principal
holidays of the church, such as Easter, Pentecost, Christ-
mas, etc., All these feasts appear to have been fixed by
the Christian teachers at the period of older pagan festivals.
The accounts of their Sabbaths are entirely similar to
those given ofsuch meetings elsewhere. They danced, sang
took part in the most horrible orgies, and came into personal
contact with Satan.
The euto-da.-:fC of Logrono, as far as it related to the
sect of the sorcerers of Zugarramurdi, caused a great sen-
sation, and brought the subject of witchcraft under the
consideration of the Spanish theologians. These were so
far more enlightened than th,e body of their contemporaries
in other countries, that they generally leant to the opinion
that witchcraft was a mere delusion, and that the details of
the confessions of the miserable creatures who were its
victims were all creations of the imagination. They were
punished because their belief was a heresy, contrary to the
doctrines of the church. Llorente gives the abstract of a
treatise on this subject by a Spanish ecclesiastic named
Pedro de Valentia, addressed to the grand inquisitor in
consequence of the trial at Logro.no in 161o, and which
remained in manuscript among the archives of the inquisi-
tion.
This writer adopts entirely the opinion that the acts
ccnfessed by the witches were imaginary ; he attributed
them partly to the methods in which the examinations
were carried on, and to the desire of the ignorant people
examined to escape by saying what seemed to please their
persecutors, and partly to the effects of the ointments a:nd
draughts which they had been taught to use, and which
were composed of ingredients that produced sle~p. and
acted upon the imagination and the mental facl!-ltics..
Spiritualism.-A writer in the Religious PhtlosopiMal
Journal says:-" The language that furnishes the largest
number of periodicals devoted to the dis~e_rnina:tion of the
doctrine and philosophy of modern SpiTltuahsm•. ~s the
Spanish. This statement will be somewhat surpnsmg to
many of our readers, for we have been accustomed t<;> lo?k
upon the Spanh\rds as non-progressive and conservative m
the extreme. Spain, until a few years, ha.'i always be~n
intolerant of any religions except the ~oman Catho~1~,
and was the latest of European nations to ytcld to the spmt
of religious progress. Protestantism has with the_ g~eatest
difficulty obtained a foothold in that countr.Y w1thm ~e
last few years, but it has been attended w1th annoymg
restrictions and persecutions, while its progress has been
exceedingly slow and discouraging.
Spiritualism in Spain commenced, as in many ~ther Jan~,
with a series of disturbances, which took place m a farmly
residing in the outskirts of Cadiz. Stone-throwing, beH-
ringing, and other preternatural annoyanc~ were the
first means of awakening attention to the subJect, and as
they occurred at the house of a Spanish gentleman who had
just returned from the United States, full of the marvels of
" the Rochester knockings," circles were at once formed,
intelligent response." by rappings obtained, and a foot-hold
gained, upon which the edifice of Spiritual progress was
upreared. So rapidly did the interest thus a":akened
spread, that the first promulgators were soon lost.s1ght .of,
and as early as 1854, a society was formed at ,Cadiz, which
was organised for the sole purpose of putrushing t.he com-
munications received from " the Spirits" durmg two
preceding years. From 1854 to 186o, Spiritualis~ ~pread
through the principal towns and villages of Spa~~ 1n the
usual fashion. Circles were held in private famihcs, and
an endless number of " societies" were formed and dts-
solved, according to the exigencies of the ti~e. One. of
the first public events of note in connection wtth Sparush
Spiritualism, was of so remarkable a character, that It
deserves special mention. This was no other . than an
Auto-da-te, the only difference between the occ~ston u~der
consideration and the fiery executions of olden bmcs bem~.
that the victims were formerly human beings, whereas m
the present instance, they were all the books, pamphlets,
and works of a Spiritualistic character that could be
procured at that period of the movement. Amongst the
pile thus offered up on the altar of religious ~nlightenment,
were the writings of Kardec Dufau, Grand•. and G~l.den­
stubbe ; some copies of English and Amencan Spm~~al
papers, and a large collection of tracts issued by the Splnt-
ualists of Spain. This memorable scene occurred on the
morning of the 9th of October, 1861, at the Esplanade Bar-
celona.
Among the well-know residents of Barcelona, was a
Spain 376
Selior Navaret, whose daughter, Rosa, had for many years
been the subject of spasmodic atta~ks. called by the
Catholic clergy " the obsession of demons "-by the
medical faculty, an aggravated condition of epilepsy.
Within two years after the Auto-da-fe, Rosa was pronounced
entirely cured, by the magnetic passes of a gentleman who
was the medium ot the private circle held in the city.
Shortly after this, Barcelona could boast of its well-
approved Spiritual organs, numerous societies for investi-
gation, and several mediums, who from their exclusive
positions in private life, would object to their names being
mentioned. The journal whs published by Sefior Alcan·
tara, and. was warmly supported by the Viscount de Torres
Solanot, and numbers of other leaders of science and
literature in Spain. By this publication the opponents of
Spiritualism were amazed to learn of the immense pro-
gress the cause was making, and the number of distin·
guished persons who assembled nightly in circles to promote
investigation. A circular calling the attention of the
Spanish public to the phenomena of Spiritualism was
published in 1875 by Viscount Solanot. The authors of
this circular, met with no response worthy of their fraternal
intentions. It might have been difficult to define exactly
what the Spanish brethren proposed to do or wished others
to unite with them in doing ; certain it is, that no tangible
results could be expected to follow from a very transcen-
dental address to the scattered ranks of a movement, whose
motto might well be Liberty, Inequality, and Disintegra-
tion : " Our Spanish friends mean well, but .is it possible
there can be unity enough amongst them to send a delega-
tion to America ? " asked one of tlJ.e shrewdest on perusing
this grandiloquent circular. Nothing daunted by the
impossibility of getting an international representation
worthy of the cause at Philadelphia, the energetic Viscount
Solanot again agitated the subject previous to the Paris
Exposition of 1878. In the articles written for El Crit~rio
on this proposition, the Viscount names amongst those
societies of Spiritualists prepared to promote an Interna-
tional representation," La Federation Espirita," of Belgium;
" The British National Association of Spiritualists,"
England; "La Sociedad Central Espirita," of the Republic
of Mexico ; and " El Central General del Espiritismo."
Notice is also taken, and with a hope of its ultimate.success,
of the attempt to form a national association and unite all
the discordant elements under the one broad banner of
simple Spiritualism.
Magnetisn1 and Mediumistic Scie~e.-In Spain as in
Italy, a considerable amount of attention has been directed
towards the unfoldment of Mediuinistic power by means of
Magnetism. Magnetic Societies abounded in Spain up to
within the last few years, when many elements of internal
discord prevailed in the ranks, and succeeded in dissolving
the bonds which had united flourishing associations.
Amongst the amateur mesmerists of Spain may be men-
tioned Don Juan Escudero, of Madrid, a gentleman who
having witnessed some experiments in "animal magnet·
ism " in California, tried its effect in his own family with
success.
Among the numerous circles or" groups" formed in the
different parts of Spain for the study of Spiritualism and
its phenomena, was one of long standing at Tarragona
called '· Tne Cnristian Circle," Quite recently the Presi·
dent of this circle sent the following communication to the
Revue SpiTite of Paris :-'' The convict prison here in
Tarragona has Boo inmates sentenced to forced labour
By some means, Spiritualistic books have been introduced
among the prisoners. The circulation of these bookS
among them has been the means of bringing seventy or
eighty of them to be believers in our doctrine. These
converts have C(l:ISed to regard their miserable position
SpaiD
from their old point of view ; they no longer entertain
schemes of revolt against the aut;horities. They endure-
their lot with resignation under the infiuence of the teach·
ing that this world is but-a preliminary stage to another,
where, if repentant of the ill they have done, and seeking
the good of others, they will be better off than here. " Not
long since one--of these men died; at his death he declined.
the established offices of the prison priest, on the ground
that he was a Spiritualist and did not need them. The-
priest then discovered that Spiritualism was a subject of
discussion with many of the prisoners. He made a repre-
sentation of the matter to his bishop, who made formal
complaint of it to the commandant of the prison, and the
comm.illdant made an investigation. In the end a particu-
lar :prisoner ·was selected for punishment in the form of an.
addttional weight of fetters. This coining to the know-
ledge of the Spiritualists of Tarragona, Barcelona, and
Lerida, they had a meeting upon th~ ~ubject ~nd d~legated
one of their number, a man of posttion, to 10tervtew the
comniandant. The representations which he made, led
the commandant to cancel his order as to the additional
fetters. The bishop's censure against spiritualist books
placed them under prohibition, which was maintained.
It is known, however, that although never found by gaolers,
the books are still tbere."
In April, t88t, the editorof the Madrid l[l Criterio says:-
"that great progress has been ma~e 1n the ca~s~ of
Spiritualism ; that the hall of meetmg of the .spmtual
Society 'i&,.completely full every Thurs~ay evelllllg.' and
is not now large enough 'to hold the public who come to
the sessions,' that Dr. Merschejewski has called the atte~­
tion of the University of St. Petersburg to a psychometric
phenomena of much importance ; to wit : A young man
deemed from childhood to be an idiot, who will in some
seconds solve any mathematical problem, while if a poe~
be read to him, even of many hundred verses, he Wlll
repeat the ,vhole of it without £~ling in a sin~le .word."
Se!l.or Manuel Lopez in the same 1ssue of El Crtteno says,
speaking of the progress o.f a society <,>f Spir;ftualists in.
Madrid :-" 'We have rece~ved a medmllllstJ.C work of
extraordinary merit, executed oy a me<l;ium of the ' So~iety
of Spiritualists ' of Zaragoza. It consiSts of a portra.1t of
Isabel the Catholic, made with a pencil, and is a work truly
admirable. It is said by intelligent persons who. have
examined it to be an exact copy of one preserved 10 the
Royal :Museum of Pa.inters of this court. Many thaaks are
tendered to the Zaragozan Society for this. highly appre-
ciated present. It was about the end of the year x88o, that.
the Spiritualists of Spain sustained a.nother series of attacks
from the Church, The first of these was the refusal of the
clergy to accord the customary rites of interment to the
remains of two ladies, both of irreproachable character, and
good standing in society, but bo~h •· guilty" of hav~g
believed in Spiritual manifestations. The seco~ ratd
which the Church in Spain perpetrated about this time
to the prejudice of the Spiritualists, w~ the SUJ>pres~ion
of a well-written Spiritual paper published at Lenda,
entitled El Buen Se11tido. The Bishop of Lerida had long
threatened this step, and·warned the editor to beware how
he presumed to allow any writings reflecting upon ~ler_ical
doings to appear in his columns. As some of the pnnc!pal
contributors were Madame Soler, Mdlle. Sans, Don Murillo,
and others equally capable of arraigning the intolerant.
acts which Church policyseemeddetermined to push against
the Spiritualists, it \vas scarcely likely that the Bishop's
threats would produce much effect. The last article which
seemed to inflame the clergy to retaliate was an indignant
protest which appeared in the columns of this p~~r o~ the
condemnation of a working man to three years unpnson-
ment, leaving a family of children destitute and all for

speaking in public against the intolerance of the Church.
In a number of £1 Criferio, dated I88I, is a letter from
Don Migueles, in which he gives a somewhat discouraging
account of •• the cause " as it recently existed in Spain.
The editor says :-" Don Migueles visited many cities to
examine into the state of affairs of a spiritual nature, but
found many who were only to be enticed by physical
phenomena, caring nothing for the esoteric beauties of our
fa!th ; many who were convinced that they knew all there
was to be known concerning it, and others who were timid
fearing the disapproval of neighbours. In some places,
~owev~r, ex~llcnt.mediums were discovered. In Santiago,
10 Ov1edo, 10 Corunna and Valladolid, an exceptional
interest was manifest. Ncar Santiago, there was a young
girl possessed of wonderfur faculties. Two bars of mag-
netized iro~ held over her horizontally, half a metre distant,
were suffic1ent to suspend her Qocly in the air. " The
proceedings of the Spanish Society, under tbe name of the
Sesiones de Controversio, in the month of April last, are
spoken of in t,he Critic as markedly impressive on accnunt of
the lofty sentiments maintained throughout the·discussions.

SpeaJ Bone, Divination by : A form of divination used in
Scotland. A speal bone, or blade bone of a shoulder of
mutton is us~d, but details ~f the method are wanting. A
common soldier, accompan}'lng Lord Loudnn on his retreat

moment it was decided, pretending to have seen the event

Spells : Spells, incantations. a written or spoken formula of
words supposed to be capable of magical effects.
Anglo-saxon ~pel, a saying or story, hence a form of
wot"ds : Icelan~hc, s·
Pjall, a saying ; Gothic, spill, a fable.
. The concept1o~ of spells appears to have arisen in the
1dea that there 1s some natural and intimate connection
between words and the things signified by them. Thus
1f.one repeats the name of a supernatural being the effect
wtll be analogous to that produced by the being itself. It is
assumed that all tnings are in sympathy, and act and
react upon nne another, things that have once been in
contact continue to. act on each other even after the con-
tact has been removed. Tqat certain names unknown to
man, of gods, demi-gods, and demons, if discovered can be
usedagainstthem by the discoverer, was believed in Ancient
Egypt. Spells or enchantments can be divided into
several classes as follows: (t) Protective spells; (2) the
cu~se o: taboo ~ .{3) Spells by which a person, animal or
ObJect IS to ~e lDJured or transformed; (4) Spells to pro-
cure some mtnor end, or love-spells, the curing of persons
and cattle, etc.
The ~w~r.of the spoken word is implicitly believed in
by all pnm1tive peoples, especially if it emanates from a
known professor of the art nf magic, and if it be in a lan-
guage or dialect unknown. Thus the magicians of Ancient
Egypt employed foreigp words for their incantations, such
J1S Tharthar, thamara, thatha, mommon, thanabotha,
opranu, brokhrex, abranazukhel," which occurs at the end
of a spell'the purpose of which is to bring dreams. The
magicians and sorcerers of the middle ages likewise em-
ployed gibberish of a similar kind, as do the medicine men
of the North American lnd.ians at the present day. The
reason for the spell being usually couched in a well-known
fon11ula, is probably because experience found that that
and no other formula.was efficacious. Thus in Ancient
Egypt n~t only were the formul<e of spells well fixed, but
the exact tone of voice in which they were to be pronounced
was specially taUf;ht. The power of a spell remains until
such time as it JS broken by an antidote or exorcism.
Therefore it is not a passing thing.
(1) The protective spell.-The cnmmonest fnrm of this is
an incantation, usually rhymed, imploringthe protection of
certain gods, saints, or beneficent beings, who in waking
or sleeping hours will guard the speaker from maleficent
powers, such as ~-
" Matthew, Mark, Luke and john,
Bless the bed that I lie on.''
Of a deeper significance are these supposed to be spoken
by the dead Egyptian on .his _journey through. Amen~i
by which he wards off the evil bemgs who would hinder h1s
way, and so the serpent who would bite the dead is ad-
dressed thus : " 0 serpent come not I Geb and Shu stand
against thee. Thou hast eaten mice. That is loathsome
to the Gods. Thou hast gnawed the bones of a putrid cat."
The Book of the Dead says, '· Whoever readeth the spells
daily over himself, he is wlrole upon earth, be escapes
from death, and never doth anything evil mellt him," says
Budge in Egyplian Magu, p. 128. "We learn bow great
was the confidence which the deceased.placed in his words
of power, and alsn that the sources from which they sprang.
were the gods of Thoth and Isis. It will be remembered
the Thoth is called the " scribe of the gods," the " lord ol
writing," the " master of papyru.s," the •· maker of the
palette and the ink-jar," the " lord of divine words,"
i.e., the holy writings or scriptures, and as he was the lord
of books and- master of the power of speech, he was con·
sidered to be the possessor of aU knowledge both human and
divine. At the creation of the world it was he who reduced
to words the will of the unseen and unknown creative Power,
and who uttered them in such wise that the universe came
into being and it was he who pmved himself by the ~xercise
of his knowledge to be the protector and the fnend of
Osiris, and nf Isis, and of their son Horus. From the
evidence of the texts we know that it was not by physical
might that Thoth helped these three gods, but by giving
them words of power and instructing them bow to use them.
We know that Osiris vanquished his foes, and that he
re-constituted his body and became the king of the under·
world and god of the dead, but he was only able to do these
things by means of the words of power which Thoth had
given to him, and which he bad tau~ht him ~o pr?nou0:ce
properly and in a proper tone of vo1ce. It iS thiS belief
which makes the deceased cry out, " Hail, Thoth, wb~
madest Osiris victorious over his enemies, make thou An1
to be victorious over hiS enemies in the presence of the
great and sovereign princes who a.re in Tattu or in. any
other place.'' \Vithout the words of power given tn h1m by
Thoth, Osiris would have been powerless under the attacks
of his foes, and similarly the dead man. who w~ always
identified with Osiris, would have passed out of eXlStence at
his death but for the words of power prvvi<Jed by the
writings that were buried with him. ln the j.11.dgment
Scene it is Tl:.oth who reports to the gods the result of the

weighing of the heart in the_balance, and who _has_suppli~
its owner With the words which he has uttered 1n his suppli-
cations, and whatever can be said in favour of the deceased
he says to the gods, and whatever can l>e done for him he
does. But apart from being the protector and mend of
03iris, Thoth W.!.S the refuge to which Isis fled in her
trouble. The words of a hymn declare that she knew " how
to turn aside evil hap," and that she was ·• strong of ton~e
and uttered the words of power which she knew w1th
correct pronunciation, and halted not in ber_ speec_b, and
was perfect both in giving the command, and m say~ng the
word," but this description only proves that she had been
instructed by Thoth in the art of uttering words of pow~r
with effect, and to him, indeed, she owed more than this:
Spells to keep away disease are of this class.
The amulets found upon Egyptian mummies, and the
inscriptions on Gnostic gems are for the most part of a
protective nature. (See Egypt and Gnostics.) The pr?·
tective spell may be said to be an amulet in words, an.d ~s
often found in connection with the amulet, on which •t 1s
inscribed.
(2) The CIIYSe or taboo.-(a) The word of blighting, the
damaging word. (b) The word of prohibition or rest.ri~tion.
(a) The curse is of the nature of a spell, even If 1t be
not in the shape of a definite formula. Thus we have the
Highland curses : ·• A bad meeting to you." " Bad under-
standing to you." " A down mouth be yours " which are
certainly popular as formula:.
Those who had seen old women, of the ?.!adge 'Vildfire
School, cursing and banning, say their manner is weli-
Cll.lculated to inspire terror. Some fifteen or twenty years
ago, a party of tinkers quarrelled and fought, first among
themselves, and then with some Tiree villagers. In the
excitement a tinker wife threw off her cap and allowed
her hair to fall over her shoulders in wild disorder. She
tlieo bared her knees, and falling on them to the ground, in
a praying attitude, poured forth a torrent of wishes that
struck awe into all who heard her. She imprecated
•.!_ Drowning by sea and conflagration by land ; may you
never see a son to follow your body to the graveyard, or a
daughter to mourn your death. I have made my wish
before this, and I will make it now, and there was not yet a
day I did not see my wish !ulfalled." Curses employed by
witches usually inferred a blight upon the person cursed,
their flocks, their herds and crops. Barrenness, too, was
frequently called down upon women. A person under a
curse or spcU is believed in the Scottish Highlands .. to
become powerless over his own volition, is alive and awake
but moves and acts as if ;:sleep." Curses or spells which
inferred death were frequently mentioned in works which
deal with ~!edireval .Magic. (See Summons by accused.)
(b) The Taboo, the word of prohibition or restriction.
This is found in the mystic expression •· thou shalt not."
Thus a number of the commandments are taboos, and the
Book of Leviticus teems with them. The taboo is the
"don't " applied to children-a curb on primitive desire.
To break a taboo was to bring dire misfortune upon one-
self, and often upon one's family.
Of injuring or transformation of a person, animal or
object there are copious examples. These were nearly
affected by a spell of a given formula. Thus no less than
twelve chapters of the Booh of the Dead (chapters LXXVII.
to LXXXVIII) are devoted to providing the deceased with
v.:ords of power, the recital of which was necessary to enable
htm to transform himself into various animal and human
forms. The Rev. S. Baring Gould in his Book of Folklore,
page 57, says, th?.t in such cases the consequence of a
spell being cast on an individual requiring him or her to
become a be:-.st or a monster with no escape except under
conditions difficult of execution or of obtaining. To this
category belong a number of so-called fauy tales, that
actually are folk-tales. And these do not all pertain to
Aryan peoples for wherever magical arts are believed
to be all-powerful, there one of its greatest achievements
is the casting of a spe!l so as to alter completely the appear-
.anee of the person on whom it is C<\St, so that this indh-idual
becomes an animal. One need only recall the story in
the Arabian Nights of the Calenders and the three noble
!~dies of Bagdad, in which the v.-icked sisters are trans-
formed into bitches that have to be thrashed every day.
Of this class are the stories of " Beattty and the Beast"
and " The Frog Prince."
(4) Spells to procure some minor end, love-spells, etc.,
Love-spells were engraved on metal tables by the Gnostics;
and the magicians of the middle ages. Instances of these
are to be found in The Booh ofthe Sacred .\fagic of Abraham
the jew (q.v.) Spells were often employed to imprison
evil spirits.
The later jews have many extravagant opinions and
legends relating to this subject, which they appear to have
derived in a great measure from the Babylonians. Jose-
phus affirms that it was generally believed by his country-
men that Solomon left behind him many spells, which
had the powt:r of terrifying and expelling evil spirits. The
Rabbins also almost uniformly describe Solomon as an
accomplished magician. It is probable that the belief in
the power of spells and incan~tions became general among
the Jews during the captivity, and that the invention of
them is attributed to Solomon, as a more creditable per-
sonage than the deities of the Assyrians. Those fictions
acquired currency, not only among the Arabs, Persians,
and other Mohammedan nations, but, in process of time,
also in many Christian communities. They were first
adopted by the Gnostics and similar sects, in whose creed
heathenism preponderated over Christianity ; and, in the
dark ages, they found their way among the Catholics ;
principally by means of the Pseudo-gospels and fabulous
legends of saints. An ·incident in the life of St. Margaret
will suffice as a specimen. This holy virgin, having van-
quished an evil spirit who assaulted her, demanded his
name. "My name," replied the demon, "is Veltis, and
I am one of those whom Solomon, by virtue of his spells,
confined in a copper caldron at Babylon ; but when the
Babylonians, in the hope of finding treasures, dug up the
caldron and opened it, we all made our escape. Since that
time, our efforts have been directed to the destruction of
righteous persons ; and I have long been striving to turn
thee from the course which thou hast embraced." The
reader of the "Arabian Nights' Entertainments" will
be immediately reminded of the story of the •· Fisherman."
The Oriental origin of many similar legends, e.g., of St.
George of Cappadocia, is equally obvious.

Spider: As an amulet. This insect, baked, was sometimes
worn round the neck as a charm. Elias Ashmole in his
Diary says : " I took early in the morning a good dose of
elixir, and hung three spiders about my neck, and they
drove my ague away. Deo Gntias ! " Spitkrs and their
webs were often recommended as a cure for this malady.
Burton gives us the following tale : ·• Being in the country
in the vacation time, not ma.ny years since, at Lindly in
Leicestershire, my father's house, I first observed this
amulet of a spitkr in a nut-shell, wrapped in silk, so applie<l
for an ague by my mothh. ..... This I thought most absurd
and ridiculous, and I could see no warrant in it.. ... till
at length, rambling amongst authors, I found this very
medicine in Dioscorides, approved by :\!atthiolus, repeated
by Aldrovandus..... I began to have a better opinion of
Splegelschrilt 379 Spiritism
it, and to give more credit to amulets, when I saw it in
some parties answer to experience."
Spiegelschrlft : Writing written backwards, from right to
left. so as to be read in a mirror. Automatic writing is
frequently done in this way, and it is said that the ability
to produce spiegelschrift is often found where there is a
natmal tendency to automatism.
Spirit in Theosophy, is the monad after he has manifested
himself in the Spiritual. l nt\Jitional and Mental Worlds
in the aspects of Will, Intuition and Intellect respectively,
but the term is often used to denote the monad in the
aspect of Will only. (See Monad and also the vari0us
articles on these Worlds.)

Spirit Photography : The production of photographs on which
alleged spirit-forms are visible. When the plate is develop-
ed there appears, in addition to the likeness of the sitter,
a shape resembling more or less distinctly the human form,
which at the moment of exposure was imperceptible to the
normal vision. Spiritualists assert that there are photo-
graphs of spirits- the spirits of departed friends and
relatives of the sitters-and that the presence of a medium
is required to facilitate their production. Notwithstanding
that on the recognition of the supposed spirit by the sitter
and others rests the main evidence in favour of spiYit
photography, the " astral figure " is generally very vague
and indistinct, with the head and shoulders enveloped in
dose-clinging draperies. The practice of spirit photography
originated in America some fifty years ago, and has enjoyed
a fitful existence to the present day. It was first intro-
duced by Mumler, a Boston photographer, in x86z. Dr.
Gardner, of the same city, was photographed by Mumler,
and on the plate appeared an image which the sitter
identified as his cousin, who had died twelve years before.
Dr. Gardner published abroad his experience, and the new
photogYaphy was at once adopted by spiritualists, who
saw in it a means of proving their beliefs. In 1863, how-
ever, Dr. Gardner discovered that in at least two instances
a living model had sat for Mumler's " spirit" pictures.
Though he continued to believe that some of the photo-
graphs might be genuine, his exposure of Mumler's fraud
effectively checked the movement for a time. After the
lapse of six years Murnler appeared in New York, where
the authorities endt>.a.voured to prosecute him, but the
evidence against him was insufficient to prove fraud,
and he was acquitted. Spirit photography had flourished
in America for some ten years before it became k-nown
in Britain. Mr. and Mrs. Guppy, the well-known
spiritualistic mediums, endeavoured without success to
produce spirit photographs in private, and at length called
in the aid of a professional photographer, Mr. Hudson. A
photograph of Mr. 'Guppy now revealed a dim, draped
" spirit" form. Hudson speedily became popular, and
his studio was as largely patronized as Mumler's h.ad been.
Mr. Thomas Slater, a London optician, made careful
observations of his process without being able to detect
any fraud. Mr. Beattie, a professional photographer, and
something of a sceptic, made the following statement con-
cerning Hudson's performances : " They were not oiade
by double exposure, nor by figures projected in space in any
way ; they were not the result of mirrors ; they were not
produced by any machinery in the background, behind it,
above it, or below it, nor by any contrivance connected
with the bath, the camera, or the camera-slide." :Mr.
TJ:aill Taylor, editor of the British Journal of Photography
said that " at no time during the preparation, exposure, or
development of the pictures was Mr. Hudsom within ten
feet of the camera or dark room. Appearances of an abnor-
mal kind did certainly appear on several plates." Such
testimonies as the above, from the lips of skilled and dis-
interested witnesses, would naturally seem to raise spiYit
photogYaphy to the level of a genuine psychic phenomenon.
But a careful analysis of the evidence, svch as is given by
l\frs. Sidgwiek in her article on Spiyit PhotogYaphy in the
Psychical Research Society's Proceedings, vol. VII., will
serve to show how even a trained investigator may be
deceived by sleight-of-hand. And it is notable that ~lr.
Beattie himself afterwards pointed out instances of double
exposure , in Hudson's productions. In spite of this,
Hudson continued to practise, and the various spiritualist
magazines continued to lend him their support, with the
exception of the Spi,itualist, whose editor, himself a
practical photographer, had aided Mr. Beattie in the
denunciation of sfmit photography. Another enthusiastic
spiritualist, Mr. Enmore Jones, who at first professed to
recognise a dead daughter in one of the pictured "spirits,"
afterwards admitted that he had been mistaken. Those
who bad pinned their faith to the genuineness of the
photographic manifestations were naturally unwilling to
relinquish their belief in what they considered a sure proof
of the reality of the spirit-world, and ingeniousexplanations
were offered to cover the circumstance of the apparent
double exposure. The spirit aura, they said, differed
from the natural atmosphere in its refracting power, and
it was not to be wondered at that objects were sometimes
duplicated. And so Hudson retained a considerable
measure of popularity. Mr. Beattie himself afterwards
attempted to produce spirit photographs, and succeeded
in obtaining vague blotches and flaws on his pictures, some
of them bearing a dim resemblance to a human figure.
But there is reason to believe tltat a hired assistant, who
provjded studio and apparatus, 'vas not entirely above
suspicion. In 1874 Buguet (q.v.), a Paris pbotogtapher
crossed over to London where he commenced the practice
of spirit photog,aphy. Many of his picture:~ were recognized
by his clients, and even when be had been tried by the
French Government, and had admitted deception, there
were those who refused to re~ard his confession as spontane·
ous, and inclined to the opmion that he bad been bribed
by the Jesuits to confess to fraud of which he 'vas innocent !
Other spirit photographers were Parkes, a contemporary
of Hudson, and Boursnell, who produced spirit pictures in
London in more recent years. The principal evidence in
favour of spil'it photography is undoubtedly the recognition
of the spirits by their friends and relatives, but the unre·
liable nature of such a test can be seen when we remember
that time and again a single " spirit " has been .claimed
by several persons as a ncar relative -the sister of one, the
gtandfather of another, and so on. One of the most
prominent defenders of the mediumistic photographers
was the Rev. Stainton Moses (q.v.)-" M.A. Oxon "-who
saw in them the best proof of the reality of spiritualism.
The same view was shared by Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace
(q.v.), who said in the Arena, January, 1891· : " It is that
which furnishes, ~rhaps, the most unassailable demon·
stration it is posstble to obtain of the objective reality of
spiritual forms."

Spiritism : The name bestowed upo'n the French form of
spiritualism, which was in the main founded on the doc-
trines of " Allan Kardec" (M. Rivail), (q.v.} SpiYitistn
differed from spiritualism as expounded tn Britain, America
and elsewhere, chiefly in that 1t included among its tenets
the doctrine of reincarnation. Allan Kardec, who prior
to his adoption of spiritualistic creeds, about 1862 had
been an exponent of animal ma$netism anll phrenology,
based' his new teachings on sp1rit revelations received
through clairvoyants, and so popular were these teachings
that they rapidly spread over the Continent. In Britain,
Spiritualism 380
however, spiritism obtained but little bold, its only exponent
being :\{iss Anna Blackwell, who endeavoured without
success to establish the doctrine of reincarnation in this
country. Spiritism and spiritualism must not be confused.
since the adherents of each section were opposed to the
tenets o! the other, and even in France. where spiritism
obtained the most footing, there was a distinct spiritualistic
party who looked askance at the doctrine of reincarnation.
The word spiritist is sometimes applied to one who seeks
only the physical phenomena, and neglects the religious
and philosophic aspect of spiritualism.
Spiritualism : Spiritualism in its modern aspect bas for its
basic principles the belief in the continuance of life after
death, and the possibility of communication between the
dead and the living, through the agency of a medium or
psychic, a person qualified in some unknown manner to be
the mouthpiece of supernatural beings. On this founda-
tion has been raised the belie£ kno·wn as spiritualism,
variously regarded as a religion or a philosophy. Besides
the spealring (or writing, drawing, etc.) indirectly through
the agency of the medium, there are also physical ma>~ifesta­
tions, such as the materialisation of spirit forms, and
" apports," (q.v.) the so-called " direct" writing, moving
of inanimate objects without contact. and other phenomena
of a like nature. The word " spiritism " used in France to
denote spiritualism, is in this country only applied to the
theories of Allen Kardec (q.v.) a well-known spiritualist
who believed in re-incarnation, or to an io.Ierior phase of
spiritualism, in which only physical manifestations arc
sou~ht, and the religious and ethical significance of the
subJect ignored.
Though the movement in its present form dates no
further back than 1848, it is possible to trace its ancestry
to witchcraft, demoniac possession, poltergeistic distur-
bances, and animal magnetism. ln these all the phenomena
?f spiritualism may be lound, though the disturbing
mfiuences were not in the earlier instances identified with
the spirits of the deceased. Many famous outbreaks of an
epidemic nature, such as that amon~ the 'Tremblers of the
Ce':'enncs (q.v.) and the Convulsionanes of St. Mcdard (q.v.),
whtch to the beholders showed clear indications of demonic
P?SSession, had in. the!r symptoms considerable analogy
With modern spJrttllaltsm. They were accompanied by
spontaneous trance or ecstasy, utterance of long-winded
discourses, and speaking in unknown tongues, all of which
arc to be found in the seance-room. The fiuency of speech,
especially of these ignorant peasants, has been equalled, if
not surpassed, by the outpourings of the unlearned medium
under the influence of her " control." ln such cases the
symptoms were generally referred either to angelicor diabolic
possession, and most frequently to the latter. \Vitcbes
also were supposed to hold converse with the Devil, and
~any aspects o.f witchcraft-and notably the part played
10 the persecutton of suspects by young women and chil-
d~en-show an obvious relationship to those poltergeistic
dtsturbanccs which were the connecting link between
early forms of possession and modem spiritr(a/ism. Cases
in which children of morbid tendencies pretend to be the
victims of a witch are to be found in every record of witch-
craft. lt was the poltergeist (q.v.), however, who showed
most affinity to the " control " of the mediumistic cirde.
For at least the past few centuries poltergeist disturbances
have occurred from time to time, and the mischievous
spirit's favourite modes of manifesting itself have been
singularly akin to those adopted by the spirit control of
our .days. Again, both. spirits r~quire the agency of a
medtum for the production of then· phenomena, and it is
in the immediate presence of the DJedium the>t the phenom-
ena generally make their appearance.
Magnetism.-Partly evolving from these phases of spirit-
Spiritualism
manifestation, and partly running parallel with them, was
an extensive movement whose significance, from the
spiritualist point of view, is very considerable. The
doctrine of animal magnetism was, said to have originated
with Paracelsus, and was much in favour with the old
alchemists. The actual magnet was not greatly used, but
was regarded as a symbol of the magnetic philosophy,
which rested on the idea of a force or fluid radiating from
the heavenly bodies, human beings, and indeed, from every
substance, animate or in•. nimate, by means of which all
things interacted upon one another. While the mystics
were engaged in formulating a magnetic philosophy, there
were others, such as Valentine Greatrakcs, who cured
diseases, claiming their power as a divine gift, and not
connecting it with the rationalist ideas o£ the alchemists.
These tv.·o phases of magnetism united and came to a
height in the work of Franz Antoine Mesmer, who in 1766
published his n~ planelartlm i11tftuu, a treatise on the
influence of the planets on the human body. His ideas
were essentially those of the magnetic philosophers, and his
cures probably on a. level with those of Valentine Greatrakes,
but into both theory <).nd practice he infused new life and
won for himself the recognition, if not of the learned
societies, at least of the general public. To him is due that
application of the magnetic system which resulted in the
discovery of the induced hypnotic trance, whose bearing
on spiritualism is obvious and important. In 1784 a
commission was appointed by the French Government to
consider magnetism as practised by Mesmer and his followers
but its report only served to cast discredit on the science,
and exclude it from scientific discussion. Until the third
decade of the nineteenth century the rationalist explana-
tions of Mesmerism concerned themselves entirely with a
fluid or force emanating from the person of the operator,
and even visible to the clairvoyant eye, but in 18<23 Alex-
andre Bertrand, a Paris physician, published a Traite du
Som~tambulisme, and in 1826 a treatise Du i'lfagnelism~
Animal en France, in which he established the relationship
between ordinary sleep-walking. somnambulism associated
with disease, and epidemic ecstasy, and advanced the
doctrine now generally accepted-that of suggestion.
Magnetism was by this time tcceiving a good deal of
attention all over Europe. A second French Commission
appointed in 1825 presented in 1831 a report which, though
of no great value, contained a unanimous testimony to the
actuality of the phenome~a. In Germany also ma~neti~m
was practised to a cons1derable extent, and ratlonahst
explanations found some acceptance. There was a class
however, more numerous in Germany than elsewhere, who
inclined tov.-ards a spiritualistic explanation of Mesmeric
phenomena. lndeed, the belief in spirit-intercourse had.
gro·wn up beside magnetism from its earliest conception,
in opposition to the theory o£ a magnetic fluid. In the
earlier phases of " miraculous " healing the cures were, as
has been said, ascribed to the divine gift of the operator,
who expelled the evil spirits from the patient. In epidemic
cases in religious communities, as well as in individual
instances, the spirits were questioned both on personal
matters and on abstract theological questions. A detailed
account of the trance utterances of a.n hypnotic subject
was given in 1787 in the journals of the Swedish Exegetical
and Philanthropic Socitty. The society naturally inclined
to the doctrines of their countryman. Emanuel Swedenborg,
'litho was the first to identify the ·· spirits ·· with the souls
of deceased men and women. ln German}' Dr. Kerner
experimented with Frederica Haufle, th~ ·· Seer~ss of
Prevorst" (q.v.), in whose pr~ence phys1ca.l .manifesta-
tions took place, and who descnbed the condttlons of the
soul after death and the constitution of ml\n-the physical
body, the soul, spirit, and neY1:~ngeist, an ethereal body
Spiritualism 381
which clothes the soul after death-theories afterwards
elaborated by spiritualists. Other German investigators,
J. H. Jung (Jung-Stilling}. Dr. C. Romer, and Dr. Heinreich
\Verner recorded the phenomenon of clairvoyance in their
somnambulcs. A French spiritualist, Alphonse Cahagnet,
produced some of the best evidence \vhich spiritualism can
show, his accounts being as remarkable for their sincerity
and good-faith as for the intelligence they display.
Magnetism received but little attention in England, till
the third decade of the nineteenth century. Towards the
end of the eighteenth century Dr. Bell, Loutherbourg, and
others, practised the scienoe in this tountry, but for about
thirty years-from 1798 to 1828--it was quite neglected.
In the latter year Richard Chenevix, an Irishman, gave
mesmeric demonstrations. Dr. Elliotson, of University
College Hospital, practised mesmerism with his somnam-
bules, the sisters Okey, and though he first believed in the
magnetic fluid, he afterwards became a spiritualist. In
1843 two journals dealing with the subject were founded
-the Zoist and the Phreno-magnet. Most of the English
magnetists of the time believed in a physical explanation
of the phenomena. In 1845 Dr. Reichenbach published
his researches, claiming to demonstrate the existence of an
emanation (q.v.} which he called odylic or odic force,
radiating from every substance. This effluence could be
seen by clairvoyants, and had definite colours, and pro-
duced a feeling of heat or cold. W'orking on individual
lines, Braid arrived at the same conclusions as Bertrand
bad done, and demonstrated the power of suggesbon in
"magnetic" experiments, but his theories were neglected
as .Bertrand's had been. By the medical profession,
especially, the whole matter was freely ridiculed, and
declared to be fraudulent. There is no doubt that their
attitude would have changed-it had, indeed, already
begun to do so--but for the wave of spiritualism that swept
over America and Europe, and magnified the extravagant
attendant phenomena of the trance state, and so obscured
its true significance and seient:Uic value.
It ·will thus be seen not only that magnetism contained
the germs of spiritualistic phenomena, but that in many
cases the phenomena were identical ''ith those of spirit-
r•aJism in its present stage of development. Trance-
speaking was well-known, physical manifestations, though
less frequently met ,~;th , were also witnessed, as in the
case of Frau Hauffe; and clairvoyance was regarded as a
common adjunct of the trance. In later years, as has been
seen, the so-called " magnetic " phenomena were largely
attributed to the agency of the spirits of the deceased.
For such an obviously supernormal faculty as clairvoyance
- by means of which the subject professed himself able
to see what was going on at a distance, or to distinguish
objects carefully concealed from.. his normal sight--even
such men as Bertrand and Braid do not seem to have
offered an adequate explanation, nor have they refuted the
evi8ence for it, though it was extensively practised both in
France and England. Indeed, there sprang up in these
countries a class who specialised in clairvoyance, and still
further prepar'tld the way for spiritualistn.
EaYly AtueYican Spiritualism. - What is generally
regarded as the birth of modern spiritualism took place in
America in 1848. In that year an outbreak of rapping
occurred in the home of the Fox family, at Hydesville, in
Arcadia, vVayne County, N.Y. The household comprised
John Fox, his wife, and their two young daughters, Mar-
garetta and Kate, aged fifteen and twelve years respectively,
and the house itself was a small wooden erection. On the
31st March, 1848, :11rs. Fox summoned her neighbours to
bear the knockings, which had disturbed the family for a
few days past. On being questioned the raps manifested
eigns o! intelligence, and it was fmaUy elicited that the
Spiritualism
disturbing influence was the spirit o! a pedlar, done to death
by a former resident of the house at Hydesville for the
sake of his money. It was afterwards said that in April
of the same year the Foxes, while digging in their cellar at
the instigation of the spirits, had disoovered thereiu frag-
ments of hair, teeth, and bones, supposed to be those of a
human being, but the statement was not properly verified,
and the evidence for the murder was but small. The
neighbours of the Fox family, however, were deeply im-
pressed by the " revelations," and, by way of a test,
questioned the spirits on such matters as the ages of their
acquaintances, questions which were answered, apparently,
with some correctness. Soon afterwards Margaretta Fox
visited her married sister, 1\irs. Fish, at Rochester, !\ew
York, where the knockings broke out as vigorously as they
had done at Hydesville. Her sister Catherine visited some
friends at Auburn, and here, too, the rappings were heard.
Many persons found themselves possessed of mediumistic
powers, and the manifestations spread like an epidemic, till
in a few years they were witnessed in most of the eastern
states. Numerous circles were formed by private individ-
uals, and professional mediums became ever more abundant.
Mrs. Fox and her three daughters continued to hold the place
of honour in the spiritualistic world, and gave exhibitions
in many large towns. In t850, while they were at Buffalo,
some professors of the Buffalo University showed that the
raps could be produced by the medium's joints, and shortly
afterwards Mrs. Norman Culver. a relative by marriage of
the Fox family, declared that Margaretta Fox had shown
her how the rappings were obtained by means of the joints.
She also alleged that Catherine l'ox had told her that in a
seance at Rochester where the medium's ankles were held
to prevent fraud, a Dutch servant maid had rapped in the
cellar on a signal from the medium. This latter statement
was hotly denied by the spiritualists, but no refutation
was attempted with regard to the other allegations. Many
mediums confessed that they had resorted to trickery, but
the tide o! popular favour in America held to the actuality
of the manifestations. These, as time went on, became
more varied and complex. Table-turning and tilting (q.v.}
in part replaced the simpler phenomena of raps. Playing
on musical instruments by invisible bands, ·• direct " spirit
writing, bell-ringing, levitation, and materialisation of
spirit hands, are some of the phenomena which were
witnessed and vouched for by such distinguished sitters as
Judge Edmonds, the Hon N. P. Tallmadge, Governor of
Wisconsin, and \Villiam Lloyd Garrison. We find the
levitation o! the medium Daniel D. Home (q.v.} recorded
at an early stage in his career. Slate-writing {q.v.} and
playing on musical instruments were also !eats practised
by the spirits who frequented Koon's "spirit-room" (q.v.}
in Dover, Athens County, Ohio. At Keokuk, in Iovva, in
x8s•h two mediums spoke in tongues identified on somewhat
insufficient data, as " Swiss," Latin, and Indian languages,
and henceforward trance-speaking in their n&.tive lan!)uage
and in foreign tongues was much practised by medmms.
The recognised foreign tongues included Latin and Greek,
French, German, Spanish, rtalian, Chinese and Gaelic, but
generally the trance utterances, when they were not in
English, were not recognised definitely as any known
language, and frequently the " spirits " themselves inter-
preted the " tongue." The latter phenomena are evidently
akin to the early outpourings of the " possessed " or the
articulate but meaningless fluency of ecstatics during a
religious epidemic. There have been cases, however,
where persons in a state of exaltation have spoken fluently
in a language of which they know but little in their normal
state. :\11any o! the " spirit " writings were signed with
the names of great people-particularly Franklin, Sweden-
borg, Plato. Aristotle, St. John and St. Paul. Trance-
Spiritualism 382
lecturing before audiences was also practised, books of
inspirational utterances were published, and poetry and
drawings produced in abundance. These automatic pro·
ductions had a. character of their own-they were vague,
high-sounding, incoherent, and distinctly reminiscent. In
cases where they displayed even a fair amount of merit, as
in the poems ofT. L. Tla.rris, it was pointed out that they
were not beyond the capacity of the medium in his normal
state. As a rule they had a superficial appearance of
intelligence, but on analysis were found to be de,·oid of
mcanin~t. During the e;•rly years ofspiritualism in America
the movement was largely noticed by the pre3S, and many
periodicals devoted ex.dusively to spiril11alism made their
appearance. The Spirit ,\fessu1ger was first published in
1849, lleat and Light in 1851, the Shekinah in 1852, Spiritual
Te!egYtlph in 1853, Spirit World, under the title of the
Spiritual Philosopher, in 1850, untler the editorship of
Larov Sunderland. From the beginning of the movement
those who accepted the actuality of the phenomena ranged
themselves into two separate schools, each represented by
a considerable body of opiruon. The theory of the first
was frankly spiritualistic, the explanation of the scc-.ond
was tlu>.t of Mesmer, now appearing under various guises,
with a more or less definite flavour of contemporary
scientific thought. These two schools, <1-s we have seen,
bad their foundation in the c~arly days of animal magnetism,
when the rationnlist ideas of the ma.gnetists were ranged
against the theories of angelic or diabolic possession. In
America the suppositious " force " of the rationalists
went by the name of ·• odylic force," "electro-magnetism,"
anii so forth, and to it was attributed not only the sub·
jective phenomena, but the physical marufestations as well.
And poltergeistic disturbances occurring from time to
time were ascribed either to spirits or odylic force, as in
the case of the Ashtabula Poltergeist (q.v.). The Rev. Asa
Mahan, one of the " rationalists," suggested that the
medium read the thoughts of the s1tter by means of odylic
force. The protagonists of a magnetic theory attributed
trance-speaking to the subject's own intelligence, but after
the birth of American spiritualism in 1848 a spiritualistic
interpretation was more commonly accepted. Notv.ith-
standing these conflicting theories, of which some were
certainly physical, practically nothing was done in the way
of scientific investigation, with the exception of the experi-
ments conducted by Dr. Hare, Professor of Cherrustry in
the University of Pennsylvania, though they hardly
desern!d the name o! ·· scientific investigation." In
185;, when the experiments were made, Hare was already
advanced in years, and seems to have been easily imposed
upon. Very few· exposures of fraud were made, partly
becaus~ the majority of the sitters accepted the phenomena
with t•llquestioning faith, and partly because the machinery
with whtch such detection might be made was not forth-
coming. The collaboration of skilful, trained, and dis-
interested investigators, such as have recently applied
themselves to the eludtlation of psychic problems, was
entirely lacking in those days, and the public was left to
form its own conclusions. Spiritualism in America was
from the first intimately bound up with socialism. The
cult of spi7ilt<alism was, in fact, the out-growth of the same
state of things which prodnccd socialistic communities,
and occasioned the rise and !all of so many strange religioilS.
Warren Chase, Horace Gre~ley, T. L. Harris, and other
prominent spiritualists founded such communities, and the
so-called " inspirational" writings frequently gave direc·
tions for their construcoon. It was characteristic of the
na jon and the time that the general trend of religious and
philosophic speculation should run on democratic lines.
The fixed standards of thought which obtained in Europe
'll·ere not recognised in America ; everyone thought for
SpirituaH3m
himself, with but httle educational training on which to
base his ideas, and the result was that the ~;gour of his
speculation frequently outran it.~ discretion. As for the·
causes which made spiritualism more popular and more
lasting than other strange doctrin~s of the time, they are
probably to be found in the special conditions which
prepared the way for spirilualisii1. Clairvoyants had
made use of rapping prior to the mediumship of the Fox
girls, the induced trance had only recently been brought
to the notice of the American people by lecturers, the
clergy and others, accustomed to departures from ortho-
doxy in e\·err direction, found no dttficulty in admitting
the intervention of good or evil spirits m human affairs,
while for those who refused to accept U1e spirit hypothe5is
a satisfactory explanation of the phenomena was found in
electricity, electro-magnetism, or "odic force."
SpiritJtalism in Engla11d.-Though, as has been said,
clairvoyants and somnambules were sufficiently common in
England prior to the importation of spiritualism in its
American form, the phenomena were, nevertheless. inter-
preted mainly on rationalist lines, and even when the spirit
doctrine-which in those days had but a small following-
became wide-spread and important, the theory of any
rational explanation was still represented. In 185~. four
years after the "Rochester Rappings," a medium named
Mrs. Hayden was brought from America by a lecturer on
"electro-biology." Soon afterwards another professional
medium, l\lrs. Roberts, crossed the Atlantic, and both
ladies had a disting\tished clientele, and received substantial
remuneration in the way of fees. l\!any of the most
influential Journals published scornful comments on these
performances, but a belief in the genuineness of the phenom-
ena was expressed by one at least, Cham/:Jers's Journal, in
an article by Robert Chambers himself. Professor de
Morgan was another distinguished witness who testified
to the actuality of the phenomena, and its supernormal
character, and yet others \<'ere disposed to im·cstigatc.
In 1853 an epidemic of table-turning (q.v.) spread from the
Continent to Britain, and attained to immense popularity
among all classes. So wide-spread did it become that
such men as Braid, Faraday and Carpenter turned their
attention to it, and showed it to result from unconscious
muscular action. The .. rationalist " explanation, be it
said, was still well ~~ the fore, with talk of odylic force,
electricity, or magnetism. l'araday's experiments were
ridiculed, and a pamphlet entitled Table-turning by A~1imaJ
.~1agnelism demrmslraled ran through more than a hundred
editions in one year. Elliotson and the other protagonists
of mesmerism fountl an illustration of their own views in
table-turning. Those who inclined to a spiritualistic
belief found a spirit agency at work in the same phenomena;
while a band of clergymen, confessedly awaiting similar
manifestations in fulfilment of Scriptural prophecy, con-
cluded that Satanic agency was at the root of the matter,
and had their conclusions supported by the " spirits"
themselves, who confessed that they were fallen angels, or
the spirits of evil-doers. Among the earliest converts to
spiritualism were Sir Charles Isham, Dr. Ashburner, and
the socialist Robert Owen, at that time already over
eighty years of age, who publishetl in 1854 the first number
of The New Existcnc6 of Mat1 upon the Earth, intended as
the organ of a sort of millenium to be brought about by the
spirits. Automatic writing is r~corned at this period, one
medium being a child of four, who wrote in Latin. In the
autumn of r853 ).irs. Hayden returned to America, and the
practice of table-turning speedily declined. Until r86o
little more is heard of spirilttulism, though a few journals
were published in the interval. Owen continued to issue
his New Existence, in which, however, spiritualism was
only a secondary consideration. The Yorkshire Spirit:4a!
Spiritualism 383
Telegraph published at Keighley in 1855, ran till the end
of 1859 (from 1857 under the name of the Bf'itish Spiritual
Telegraph). There were also a few other periodicals which
did not enjoy so long a lease of life. But though tbe
British books and papers dealing with the subject were but
few, the lack was supplied by American productions, which
were largely read in this country. Mediums, as ~-ell as
literature, were imported from America, notable among
them being Daniel Dunglas Home (q.v.) who crossed over to
Britain in r855 at the age of twenty-three, and who had
already acted as a medium in America for some foliA· years.
Many of those who afterwards became prominent mediums
were first coverted to spiritualism at Home's seances. In
the autumn of 1855 Home returned to America, and in
1856 his place was taken by P. B. Randolph, who attended
the meetings of the Charing Cross Circle. In 1859 came
the Rev. T. L. Harris, deputed by the spirits to visit Eng-
land. An English medium, named Mrs. Marshall, gave
seances professionally, but much less successfully than
did Home and the American medil•ms, though the phenom-
ena were of a similar kind. English spiritualists, however,
did not court publicity, but practised for the most part
anonymousty. The phenomena at these seances resemble
those in America-playiolg of instruments without visible
agency, materialisation of hands, table-turning, and so·on-
but on a much smaller scale. It was not so much these
physical manifestations, however, which inspired the con-
fidence or excited the credulity of early spiritualists, but
rather the automatic writing and speaking which, rare at
first, afterwards became a feature of mediumistic seances.
So early as 1854 the trance utterances of a medium named
Annie were recorded by a circle of Swedenborgians presided
over by Elibu Rich. The importance given at this stage
of the movement to subjective phenomena must be attribu-
ted to an imperfect understanding of unconscious cerebra-
tion. Such men as Mr. Thomas Shorter, editor of the
Spiritual Magazint, failed to comprehend how the medium
was able to reason while in the trance state, and to perform
inteUigent acts of which the normal consciousness knew
nothing. Therefore they adopted the spirit hypothesis.
Mrs. de Morgan and Mrs. Newton Crosland gave a ready
credence to the automatic utterances of thei:- friends. Sym-
bolic drawings were a feature of Mrs. Crosla.l"l's circle, as was
also the speaking in unknown tongues, wi.ich were trans-
lated by the spirit through another mecl:.um.
In x86o a new spiritual era opened, and the whole subject
came into more prominence than it had done heretofore.
This was due to the increase in the number of British
mediums and the emigration to Britain of many American
mediums, including the Davenport Brothers (q.v.) and
D. D. Home, who once more visited England in 1859.
Home was treated respectfully, r.ot to say generously. by
the bulk of the press and by the public, and admitted to tl1e
highest grades of society. Another American medium who
practised about the same time was J. R. M. Squire, whose
manifestations were vouched for by Dr. Lockhart Robert-
son. Other mediums there were, however, such as Colches-
ter and Foster, who practised trickery so openly thal tbe
spiritualists themselves exposed their fraud, though main-
taining that at times the manifestations even of these
mediums were genuine. After Home, the most famous
American mediums were the brothers Da\"enport, who
practised various forms o! physical mediuruship. They
took their places in a small cabinet, bound hand and foot
to the satisfaction of the sitters. \1</hen the lights were
lowered, musical instruments were thrown about the room
and played upon and other physical phenomena were
apparent. When the se; occ was over and the lights once
more raised, the brothers Da,•enport were found securely
fastened in their cabinet. The manifestations were so
Spiritual!sm
skilfully produced that many people hesitated whether to
regard them as clever conjoring or spirit phenomena. At
length, however, the Davenports were exposed through
the agency of a secret knot called the" Tom Fool's knot,"
which they were unable to untie, and which rendered the
necessary escape from their bonds impossible. Their career
in Britain was at an end. Shortly afterwards the conjuring
performances of Maskclyne and Cook, in emulation of the
Davenport Brothers, drove the s~ritualists to conclude
that they also must bo renegade med.turns. Native medium-
ship developed much more slowly in England than that of
the American spiritualists. Mrs. Marshall was for a time
practically the only professional medium of standing in the
country, though private mediums were less rare. Notable
among the latter were Mrs. Everitt, Mr. Edward Child, and
Miss Nichol, afterwards the second wife of Mr. Guppy, who
became a famous medium. During lhis period poltergeistic
disturbances were still recorded in which all the familiar
phenomena reappeared, but they were explained on
spiritualist lines. Crystal vision was practised and auras
were comm9nly seen by the medium round tl1e heads of his
friends. Automatic writing, speaking, and drawing con-
tinued, and inspirational addresses, etc., were published.
In Ill69 a new impulse was given to spiritualism by the
appearance of several public mediums, chief among them
being F. Heme, who devoted his talents to the production
of physical manifestations, and in connection with whom
we first sec the phenomenon of "elongation" (q.v.).
Within a few years a number of other English mediums
sprang up-Eglinton, Monck, llita, and many more, while
Dr. Slade, Annie Eva Fay, and Kate Fox (who afterwards
married an English barrister named Jencken) came over
from America. In 1870 the Rev. W. Stainton Moses
(" M. A. Oxon,") destined to be one of the greatest of
English mediums, devoted himself to private mediumship.
In 1872 there was introduced into England, through the
agency of the Guppys, the practice of Spirit Photography
(q.v.), which had originated ten years earlier in America.
To very many people a photograph containing, in addition
to the sitter's portrait, a vague splotcll of white, was con-
clusive evidence of the materialisation of spirits. After
numerous exposures the craze for spirit photography
declined and of late years little has been heard of it, though
in spasmodic fashion it sometimes shows evidence of life.
Slate-writing (q.v.) was a favourite mode of " direct"
writing and one extensively practised. Sittings were
generally held in the dark, and"tllC sitters were enjoined to
talk or sing, or perhaps a musical box was played. Most of
the records of these earlier seances are singularly suggestive
of fraud. In 187.1 Mrs. Jenckcn (Kate Fox) was staying at
Brighton with her baby. aged about six months, and it is
related that the baby became a writing medium. A
facsimile of its writing was published in the Medium aud
Daybreak of ?!-lay 8th, 1874· In the same year came Mrs.
Annie Eva Fay whose feats resembled those of the Daven-
ports. Another celebrated medium was David Duguid, of
Glasgow, who painted "under control." In 1876 Henry
Slade came from America, and turned his attention chiefly
to slate-writing. A few months after his appearance in
Britain Professor Ray J_ankester detected him in fraud,
pro~uted him, and finally obliged him to leave the
country. But the c•owning manifestation, the climax of
spiritual phenomena and apparently the most difficult
of achievement, was materialisation (q.v.) It began with
the materialisatioo of heads, hands, and arms, and pro-
ceeded to full materialisation. ln r872 1\frs. Guppy
attempted this form of manifestation, but with no con-
spicuous success. The mediums Herne and \Villiams also
included it in their repertory, but a new and successful
medium made her appearance-Florence Cook, who
.Spiritualism 384
materialised the spirits of " John" and "Katie t{jng."
\Vhen, during a s6ancc, ~[iss Cook ,.vas seized by Mr.
Volckman while impersonating a spirit, the exposure drew
from Sir WiUiam Crookcs several letters testifying to the
honesty o! the medium, with whom he had experimented,
and rather helped the cause of spiritualism than otherwise.
Other private mediums also gave materialisation seances,
and from them tbe contagion spread to their professional
brethren, among whom the most successful was undoubtedly
William Eglinton. ;\[iss Lottie Fowler also attained to
fame as a medium about the same time--the decade 187o-
8o. These open s6anccs offered a better opportunity to
the investigator, and though even in them some care was
doubtless exercised to prevent the intrusion of " adverse
influences," there were a good many instances where a
sceptic ventured to grasp the spirit, and when this occurred
spirit and medium were always !round to be one and the
same. By way of apology for these untoward happenings
the Spirit~talist suggested that the spirit was composed of
emanations from the medium, and that when it was grasped
by the sitter spirit and medium would unite, the form
possessing most of the medium's force rejoining the other.
Another explanation, especially applicable to physical
manifestations, was that genuine mediums, giving pro-
fessional seances, anrl forced to produce the phenomena on
all occasions, would sometimes resort to fraud when their
mediumistic powers temporarily failed them. This per-
fectly plausible excuse was always ready to meet a charge of
fraud. The subjective phenomena, as time advanced
became less in favour with investigators, who began really
to understand its subjective nature. but with spiritualists
it remained the most important form of manifestation
The trance utterances of Home (q.v.), Stainton Moses, and
i\Iiss Lottie Fowler were highly valued. David Duguid,
the celebrated painting medium, was controlled by a new
spirit, Hafed, Prince of Persia, whose life and adventures
were delivered through the medium. Prominent inspira-
tional speakers were Mrs. Emma Hardinge Britten, 1. 1.
~Iorse, and Mrs. Cora L. V. Tappan-llichmond. Among
English periodicals devoted to spiritualism were Human
Nature, first issued in x867; the J,fedittm and Daybreak,
founded a few years later; the Spiritual Magazi"e; and
the Spiritualist (1867), edited by Mr. W. H. Harrison, and
treating the subject in a scientific manner. A still more
recent paper, Light, dates from x881, and still remains one
of the principal organs of the movement. One of the
earliest investigators was Sir William Crookes, whose
cxpe;iences with D. D. Home are not to be lightly passed
by. In 1863 Professor de Morgan, in a preface to l\Irs. de
Morgan's book, From Matter to Spirit, suggests the agency
of some mysterious force, though he did not become a
spiritualist until afterwards. In r868 Cromwell Varley,
the electrician, testified to the phenomena of Home. In
the following year the London Dialectical Society appointed
a Committee to enquire into the matter, whose members
included Alfred Russel Wallace (q.v.). Charles Bradlaugh,
and Sergeant Cox. The report of the committee stated
that the subject was " worthy of more serious and careful
investigation than it has hitherto received."' Cromwell
Varley, and the Research Committeeof. the British Nationa I
A.'lsociation of Spiritualists carried out various electrical
and other test-s, but a~ these have since been proved to be
inadequate, it is not necessary to consider them in detail.
On the other hand Faraday and Tyndall, Huxley and
Carpenter, refused to have anything to do with the psychic
phenomena, and opposed the spiritualistic movement in a
spirit of intolerance which contrasted unfavourably with
the attitude of its scientific protagonists. Meanwhile the
old rationalist school of believers in magnetic or odylic
emanations still lingered and were represented by the
Spiritualism
Psychological Society (founded in 187:1• and came to an
end in 1879), the writings of its prestdent, Sergeant Cox,
and those of the well-known spiritualist, ~Ir. Samuel
Guppy. One other scientific man of the period is deserving
of mention in this connection. In 1876 Professor Barrett
(now Sir William), lecturing before the British Association,
declared that hyperresthesia and suggestion were not alone
capable of explaining the phenomena, and urged the
necessity for appointing a. committee to investigate. How-
ever, his suggestion was not acted upon, and in t88z he
called a conference to consider the question. The direct
result of this conference was the foundin~ of the Society
for Psychical Research. Up to this potnt the English
movement differed from the American less in kind than in
degree, for it was altogether weaker and more restricted.
Indeed, the difference in tite traditions of the two countries.
and in the Reneral temper of their people, rendered it
impossible that the movement should spread here as rapidly
as it had done in America, or that it should be embraced
with such fervour. It was not-probably for the same
reason-inimical to Christianity in England, but rather
supplementary to it, and there were those who claimed to
be converted to Christianity through its means.
The Society for Psychical Rcsearch,-The history of the
criticism of occult phenomena in Great Britain from r882
to the present time is intimately connected with the
Society for Psychical Research, and there is no development
worthy of record which its members have not investigated.
It was the first body to make a united and organised attempt
to deal with what was called, for want of a better name,
psychic phenomena, in a purely scientific and impartial
spirit, free from the bias of pre-conceived ideas on the
subject. It was, indeed, expressly stated in their prospec-
tus that the members in no wise bound themselves to
accept any one explanation, or to recognise in the phenom-
ena the working of any non-physical agency. The first
president of the Society was Professor Henry Sidgwick,
and the Council numbered among its members F-dmund
Gurney, Frank Podmore, Frederic W. H. Myers, and
Professor Barrett; and the Rev. W. Stainton 1\roses,
Morell Theobald, Dr. George Wild, a_nd Dawson Rogers,
the latter four being spiritualists. It may be mentioned,
however, that the avowedly spiritualistic members of the
Society gradually dropped off. Other presidents of the
Society were, Professor Balfour Stewart, the Rt. Ron. A. 1.
Ballour, Professor William James, Sir William Crookes,
Sir Oliver Lodge, and Professor Barrett, several of these
being among the ori~inal members. The scope of the
Psychical Research Soc1cty was defined by the appointment
of six committees, as follows :-(1) Committee on Thought
Transference; (z) Committee on Hypnotism; (~) Com-
mittee on Reichenbach's Experiments; (1> Comnuttee on
Apparitions; (5) Committee on Physical (spiritualistic)
Phenomena ; and (6) a Committee to cons•der the history
and existing literature of the subject. The field of the
Society was thus a wide one, and it \<aS still further en-
larged in later years, when a comm1ttee, headed by Dr.
Richard Hodgson, conducted an enquiry into Theosophy
(q.v.). And the methods of psychic research were applied
to other matters also, which were outside of the Society's
original scope. In order to find an explanation for the
spiritualistic phenomena, its members journeyed into the
domain of psychology, and studied automatism. hallucina-
tions. and thought transference. one o• other of which has
been proved to have an important bearing on much of the
spiritualistic phenomena, if not on all. They were also
instrumental in detecting a. ~rcat deal nf fraud in connec-
tion with mediumistic performances, espectally in such
phenomena as slate-writin~ (q.,·.) and oth~r ··physical··
manifestations. The explani'.tion of the.~e in ilct, formed
Spiritualism 385
one of the chief aims of the Soci4ty. Though at the time
of its founding public mediumsh1p seemed to have de-
clined ; there was still more than enough phenomena for
the Society to investigate, and the testimony of Sir William
Crookes and others of standing and intellectual strength
indicated that the matter was at least a fit subject for
investigation. In connection with slate-writing, which
m<tny persons declared to be genuine and so simple that
fraud was impossible, Mr. S. J. Davey, a member of the
Society, gave a number of pseudo-s~nces. Having be'!n
himself deceived for a time by the performances in that
line of the well-known medium, William Eglinton, and
having at length discovered the modus of his slate-writing
feats, l'Ylr. Davey set himself to emulate the medium's
" manifestations." In the interests of psychic research he
undertook to give sittings, which were carefully recorded
by Dr. Hodgson. So well were the devices of the pro-
fessional mediums reproduced that none of the sitters were
able to detect the modus operandi of Davey's performances,
even though they were a~ured beforehand that it was
simply a conjuring trick. Such a demonstration could not
fail to do more than any amount of argument to expose
the " phenomenon •· of slate-writing. (Sec article on
Slate-writing.) Excellent work was done by the Society
in the collection of evidence relating to apparitions of the
dead and the living, many of which are embodied in Phat~­
tasnzs ofthe living, by Messrs. Myers, Podmore and Gumey.
A statistical enquiry on a large scale was undertaken by a
Committee of the Society in r889. Some 17,ooo cases of
apparitions were collected by the committee and its
assistants. The main object in taking such a census was
to obtain evidence for the working of telepathy in veridical
or coincidental aJ?paritions, and in order to make such
evidence of scientific value, the utmost care was taken to
insure the impartiality and responsible character of all
who took part in the enquiry. The result was, that after
every precaution had been taken the apparitions coinciding
with a death or other crisis were found greatly to exceed
the number which could be ascribed to chance alone. (See
also Psychical Research.) But the most fruitful of the
Society's researches were those concerning telepathy (q.v.),
or thought-transference, and it was through the influence
of its members that the doctrine of thought-transference,
so long known to the vague speculations of the old mag-
netists and mesmerists, was first placed on a definite basis
as a problem worthy of scientific enquiry. Investigations
into this matter arc still progressmg, and trustworthy
proof of such a mode of communication would affect the
scientific view of splritualism to a remarkable degree.
Among the individual efforts of members of the Society for
Psychical Research the most com}>lete and the most success-
ful were those conducted by Pro essor and Mrs. Sidg,vick in
r889-91. (See Telepathy.) At the same time there was
much to encourage the belief in some " supernormal "
agency, especially in the la~t decade of the nineteenth
century. The two mediums whose manifestations len
many able men in this country, in America, and on the
Continent, to conclude that the spirits of the dead were
concerned in their phenomena were the Italian medium
Eusapia Palladino (q v.) and the American Mrs. Pipt>r.
In t88s Profes..~or James, of Harvard, studied the case of
Mrs. Piper (q.v.), and a few years later Dr. Richard Hodgson
of the Amencan Society for Psychical Research also investi-
gated her case, the latter commencing his investigations in
an entirely sceptical spirit. Of all the trance mediums she
offers the best evidence for a supernatural agency. Dr.
Hodgson himself declared his belief that the spirits of the
dead spoke t.l-trough the lips of the medium, and among
others who held that f~aud alone would not account for
the revelations given by Mrs. Piper in the trance state were

admitting any supernormal11gcncy, suggests that t~lepathy

observation and carefully-conducted enquiries conceming
the affairs of prospective sitters. 1\>!rs. Sidgwick, again,
suggested that probably 1\frs. Piper received telepathic com-
ml!nications from the spirits of the dead, which she repro-
duced in her automatic speaking and writing. The other
medium was Eusapia Palladino, who, after attracting
considerable attention from Professors J...ombroso, Richet,
Flammarion, and others on the Continent, came to Britain
in 1895. Several English scientHic men had already
witnessed her tclergic powers on the Continent, at the
invitation of Professor Charles Richet-Sir Oliver Lodge,
Mr. Myers, and others -and of these Sir Oliver Lodge, at
least, had expressed himself as satisfied that no known
agency was responsible for her remarkable manifestations.
The English sittings were held at Cambridge, and as it was
proved conclusively that the medium made use of fraud,
the majority of the investigators ascribed her " manifesta-
tions " entirely to that. I.ater, however, in r898, a
further series of seances were held at Paris, and so success-
fully that Richet, Myers, and Sir 0. Lodge once more
declared themselves satisfied of the genuineness of the
phenomena. A further account of this medium will be
found under a separate heading. Perhaps the most con-
vincing evidence for the working of some supernormal
agency, however, is to be found· in the famous cross-corres-
pondence experiments conducted in recent years. l'Ylr.
Myers had suggested before he died that if a control were
to give the same message to two or more mediums, it would
go far to establish the independent existence of such con-
trol. On the death of Professor Sidgwick (in August, 1900)
and of Mr. 1\Iyers (in January, 1901) it was thought that
if mediums were controlled by these, some agreement might
be looked for in the scripts. The first corres_pondenccs were
found in the script of Mrs. Thomson and Miss Rawson, the
former in London, the latter in the south of France. The
Sidgwick control appeared for the first time to these ladies
on the same day, January I xth, I90I. On the 8th of
May, 1901 the 1\fyers control appeared in the script of :.\irs.
Thompson and Mrs. Verrall, and later in that of l'Ylrs. Piper
and others. So remarkable were the correspondences
obtained in some cases where there could not possibly be
collusion between the mediums, that it is difficult to believe
that some discarnate intelligence was not responsible for
some, at least of the scripts. (See also Cross-Correspon-
dences.}

ists, mediums, and investigators dealt with in tlus work,

By far the most cxtraordin.'\ry experiments in connection
with psychic phenomena were those undertaken by Sir
William Crookcs. Working under the most stringent con-
ditions he and his fellow experimenters assured themselves
that entrance or exit to the room in which their seances
were held was impossible. Yet he succeeded oy the aid of
a medium in obtaining the best possible evidence of the
presence of spirits or other entities in the apartment.
These were of a tangible nature and were actually weighed
by Sir Vllilliarn, who on one occasion even succeeded in
obtaining a portion of the protoplasmic matter from which
these entities were built up, which he kept in a box for
several days. These entities emerged from the body of the
medium or from that of one of the sitters, walked about,
spoke, and e,·en debated loudly and noisily with Sir
\Villiam and the other sitters on many different topics over
Spiritualism 386 Spiritualism
a prolonged space of time. They frequently vanished
through the 11oor. Sir William found their average weight
to be about one-third of that of a human being. These
phenomena were witnessed by numerous persons of the
highest intelligl'nCe and probity, among them, it is under-
stood, some of exaltt-d rank. A full statement regarding
the phenomena in all their details may be found in Mr.
Gambier Bolton's interesting little volume Ghosts in Solid
Form.
~o work of recent times furnishes the student of psychic
research with such a masterly conspectus of the subject as
Sir W'illiam F. Barrett's On the Threshold of the U1zsee"
(1917). Expanded from an address on the phenomena ot
spiritualism delivered some twenty years ago, it covers
the whole history of psychical res!'.arch during that period
and a notice of it may well serve to complete this article
and furnish the reader with data concerning psychical
research during the present century. The introductory
chapter briefly 'reviews the work of eminent scientists and
provides a frank statement of the present position of psychi-
cal research. Public opinion regarding the quest, and the
conflicting objections of science and religion arc briefly
reviewed in chapters II. and Ill., and are followed by an
essay on the physical phenomena of spiritualism, which
contains little that is not noticed in the present article.
Chapter VII., " On Certain more Disputable Phenomena of
Spirit11alism," deals with examples of the direct voice and
direct writing, materialization and spirit photography, all
of which phenomena have been termed ectoplasms by
Professor Ochorowicz of \Yarsaw. " By Ectoplasy," says
Sir \Yilliam. " is mt>.ant the power of forming outside the
body of the medium a concentration of vital energy or
vitalized matter which operates temporarily in the same
way as the body from which it is drawn, so that visible,
audible or tangible human-like phenomena are produced.
This is very much like the ' psychic force ' hypothesis
under a new name. The chapter " On the Canons of
E,·idcnce in Psychical Research " includes a sentence which
might well be taken to heart by the too sceptical : " It
is utterly unphilosophical to ridicule or deny well-attested
phenomena because they arc inexplicable." Sir \\'iJI'am
shows how the critical examination of psychic phenor..ena
has languished because of the lack of trained sctentific
obsen·ers, those dc"oting thcmsel"es to the subjEoct being
for the most part persons of more enthusiasm than judg-
ment. The chaptpr on theories is eminently useful. " I
ha,·c never yet.'•' says the author, " met with anyone who
has seriously studied the evidence or engaged in prolonged
in\'l'.stigation of this subject who holds · that all mediums
are impostors.' " The theories examined to account for
supemomtal phenomena include those of hallucination.
which is only partially admitted as a cause. F.xo-neural
action of the braih which is, however, a sub-conscious
action, an effect of the subliminal self, but perhaps the
most interesting of the hypolhe~es which account for these
miraculous happenings is described as follows: " It may
be that the intelligence operating at a s<:ance is a thought-
projection of Ottrsclvcs--that each one of us has his simu-
lacrum in the unseen ; that with the growth of our life
and character here a ghostly image of oneself is g<owing up
in the invisible world." The Problem of lllediumsllip is
the subject of the tenth ctt."lpter. Objection is taken to
the word " medium," not only because of its associations,
but for more scientific reasons. A separate division of the
book is occupied with the phenomenal evidence afforded
by apparitions, automatic writing, supernormal messages,
and the evidence of identity in the discarnate condition
and of survival after death. The last portion of the volume
brings the question of human personality up to date,
especially as regards its higher aspects, the conclusion being
that only the barrier of our st.nse perceptions, a " threshold
of sensibility," divides us !romthe world beyond our normal
consciousness, just as " the organism of an oyster con-
stitutes a threshold which shuts it out !rom the greater part
of our sensible world." As re~ards the question of immor-
tality it is concluded that " Life can exist in the unseen,"
but it does not follow that spiritcommunications teach us the
necessary and inherent immortality of the souL " If
we accept the evidence !or ' identity,' that some we have
known on earth arc still living and neaT us," we have still
to remember that " entrance on a life after death does not
necessarily mean immortality, that is eternal per..istence
of our personality, nor docs it prove that survival after
death extends to all. Obviously no experimental evidence
can ever demonstrate either of these beliefs, though it may
and does remove the objections raised as to the possibility
of survival."
Towards the end of 1916 a great sensalhn w<>s made not
only in occult but in general circles by t;1e publication by
Sir Oliver Lodge of a memoir upon his son, the late Lieuten-
ant Raymond Lodge, who was killed uear Ypres in Septem-
ber, 1915. The book is divided into three parts, the first
of which contains a history of the brief life of the subject
of the memoir. The second part details numerous records
of sittings both in the company of mediums and at the
table by Sir Oliver Lodge and members o! his family,
and it is claimed t11at in these many evidences of the per-
sonal survival of his son were obtained. that the whole
trend of the messages was eloquent of his personality and that
although if the evidential matter were taken apart for
examination single isolated proofs would not be deemed
conclusive, yet when taken in a body it provides evidential
material o! an important nature. There is certainly ground
for this contention and it must be admitted that proofs
of identity are more valuable when experienced by those
who were familiar with the subject during his earthly
career. But to those who have not had this opportunity
the balance of the evidence seems meagre and it is notable
that in this especial case most of the tests of real value
broke down when put into practice. The third part of the
book deals with the scicnti1ic material relating to the life
after death which is reviewed and summarized in a spirit of
great fairness, although a natural bias towards belief in
immortality is not a little obvious. In this the work
differs from that by Sir William Barrett, with its wholly
scientific attitude and its greater natural ability to discern
dialectical weaknesses. but it is far !rom being unscientific
in character. On the other hand Sir Oliver Lodge's work
is inspired tllroughont by an enthusiasm which if not
entirely absent in that of Sir 'William Barrett, is certainly
not conspicuous in that writer's treatise. Sir Oliver's
enthusiasm is, indeed, that of a Columbus or a Galileo.
Throughout the centuries the pioneer and discoverer have
been uplifted and assisted more by faith than by reason, and
it is probably because of his abounding faith in human
immortality that Sir Olivet Lodge will in future be regarded
as perhaps the greatest pioneer in psychic science. not
only of his own generation but of many generations. L. S.
Spiritualism os a Religion.-Spiritualis·m was, and is,
<egarded by its adherents as a religion. or a supplement to
an existing religion, imposing certain moral obligations and
offering new and far-reaching revelations on the conditions
of existence beyond the gmve. The continuity of life after
death is, of course, one of its most important tenets, though
not a distinctive one ; since on it depend most of the
world's creeds and religions. But the spiritualist's ideas
concerning the "oturt of the life of the !reed soul are peculiar
to his creed. The soul, or spirit, is composed of a sort of
attenuated matter, inhabiting the body and resembling
it in form. On the Math of the body the soul withdraws
Spiritualism 387 Staus Poltergeist
itself, without however, undergoing any direct change, and
for a longer or shorter period remains on the " earth plane."
But the keynote of the spirit-world is progYess; so after
a time the spirit proceeds to the lowest •· discarnate plane,"
and from that to a higher and a higher, gradually evolving
into a purer and nobler type, until at length it reaches the
sphere of pure spirit. Another central belief of spiritualism
is that the so-called " dead " can, and do, communicate
with the living, througlo the agency of mediums, and can
produce in the physical world certain phenomena dep~nd­
ing for their operation on no known physical laws. To tne
earnest spiritualist, requiring no further proof of the
reality of his creed, the !.ubjoctivc phenomena, as they are
called, comprising trance-speaking. writing, etc.. are of
vastly greater importance than the physical manifestations,
just as the latter are more in favour with psychical re-
searchers, because of the better opportunities they offer
for investigation. From the trance·speaking of the medium
are gathered those particulars of the spirit world which to
the outsider present one of the most unattractive pictures
extant of that domain. The spirit liCe is, in fact, rcpre·
sented as a pale and attcuuatcd reproduction of earthly
life, conducted in a highly rarified atmosphere. Trance
drawings, purporting to depict spirit scenes, afford a
description no less flattering than the written picture.
From their exalted spheres the spirits arc cognisant of the
doings of their fellow-men still on earth, and are at all
times ready to aid and counsel the latter. This they can
do only through the medium, who is a link between the seen
and tqe unseen, perhaps through some quality of super·
normal sensitiveness. There are those who maintain that
those mediums who hold seances and become the direct
mouthpieces of the spirits are only supeTeminently endowed
with a faculty common to all humanity-that all men are
mediums in a greater or less degree, and that all inspiration,
v.hether good or bad, comes from the spirits. It is in
connection with this idea of the universality of mediumship
that the effect of spi..ituolism on the morals and daily life
of its adherents is most clearly seen. For the spirits are
naturally attracted to those mediums whose qualities
resemble their own. Enlightened spirits from the highest
spheres seck high-souled and earnest mediums through
whom to express themselves, while mediums who use their
divine gifts for a base end arc sought by the lowest and
wickedest human spirits, or by beings termed " elementals,"
who do not even reach the human standard of goodness.
Indeed, it is stated that the lower spirits communicate
with the living much more readily than do the higher, by
reason of a certain gross or material quality which binds
them to earth. The path of the ml'dium is thus beset with
many difficulties, and it is essential that he should be
principled and sincere, a creature of pure life and high
idl'.als, so that the circle of his " controts " be select. For
not only do the tricky " elementals " deceive the sitters
and the investigators with their lying ways, but they oft-
times drive the medium himself to fraud, so that under their
control he secretes " apports " about his person. and
materialises false beards and dirty muslin. And as it is
with the full-fledged 1nedium, so with the normal individual.
If he is to insure that the source of his inspiration be a
high one he must live in ::out~h a way that only the best
spuits will control llim, and so his impulses shall be for his
own good and the betterment of the race. It will thus be
seen that spiritualism is in itself a complete religion; but
it also combines well with other religions and creeds. In
America the spiritualistic and the socialistic elements
mingled harmoniously and many of the socialis~ic com-
munities were founded by spiritualists. Other sects there
were which associated themselves with spirituolism during
the early history of the movemenl in America, and rumour
-somewhat unfairly, it must be admitted-would have
associated with it some less creditable ones, such as that
which advocated free Love. But the many forms which
spiritualism took in America were, as bas been said, the
product o( the country and the time. In other lands the
forms were different. In England, for instance, where
wont and tradition were more happily settled, spiritualism
was regarded as by no means incompatible with Christianity
but rather as affording a fuller revelation of the Christian
religion, a view which the trance utterances oC the medium
coafumed. In France, again, AJian Kardcc's doctrine of
re-incarnation blended happily with the doctrines of
spiritualism to produce spirittsm. Then we have the more
modem example of theosophy (q.v.). a blending of spirituol-
ism with oriental religions. But all these varied forms
contain the central creed of spiritualism ; the belief in the
continuance of life after the ·•great dissolution," or death
of the body, and in continual progress; and in the fact of
communication between the freed spirit and living human
beings. On the whole spiritualists have shown themselves
rather tolerant than otherwise to those who were not of their
band. On the one hand their mediums did not hesitate
to claim kinship with the witards, shamans and witch-
doctors of savage lands, whom they hailed as natural
mediums ; and on the other, there were many able and
sincere spiritualists who joined forces with the Psychical
Researcher, in the unflinching endeavour to expose fraud
and get at the truth. M. J.

Staus Poltergeist : The village of Staus, on the shores of Lake
Lucerne, was in the years x86o-62 the scene of the most
remarkable case of poltergeist-haunting to be found in
modern records. 'fhe outbreak occurred in the bouse of
M. Joller, a distinguished lawyer and a member of the
Swiss national council, a man, moreover, whose character
both in public and private life was beyond reproach. The
household comprised M. JoUer himself, bis wife, seven
ohildren (four boys and three girls), and a servant-maid.
One night in the autumn of t86o the latter was disturbed
by a loud rapping on her bedstead, which she regarded as a
presage of death. ;:o.r. joller ascribed lhe sounds to the
girl-'s imagination, and forbade her to speak of them. A
few weeks later, returning after a short absence, he found
his family much alarmed. The knocks had been repeated
in the presence of his wife and daughter, and had even
Staus Poltergeist 388 Subliminal Self
manifested signs of intelligence. When, a few days after-
wards, they had news of the death of a friend, they imagined
that this must have been what the raps portended. But
again in June, x86I the outbreak was renewed. This time
it was one of the boys who fainted at the apparition of a
white, indistinct figure. Other strange things began to be
seen and heard by the children, and a few months later the
maid complained that the kitchen was haunted by dim,
grey shapes who followed her to her chamber, and sobbed all
night in the lumber-room. In October of the same year
the maid was replaced by another, the rappings ceased, and
the disturbances seemed to be at an end. They were re-
newed, however, and with tenfold vigour, in August, r862,
during the absence on business of l\1. Joller, his wife, and
their eldest son. So great was the annoyance that the
children fted from the house into the garden, in spite of their
father's threat to punish their credulity. But at length
the poltergeist began to persecute 1\I. Jolter himself, pursuing
him from room to room with loud knocks, and not all his
efforts sufficed to elucidate the mystery. Things began to
be thrown about by invisible hands. locked doors and
fastened windows were flung wide, strange music and voices
and the humming of spinning-wheels were heard. In
spite of M. Joller's attempts to conceal these happenings.
the news spread abroad, and hundreds, even thousands, of
persons flocked to witness the phenomena. Finding no
rational hypothesis to fit the circumstances M. Joller begged
the Commissary Niederberger to come and investigate, but
in the latter's absence Father Guardian visited the haunted
house, blessed it, though without alleviating the distur-
bances, and suggested that an enquiry be made by men of
authority. M. ]oller privately called in several scientific
men of his acquaintance, but they also were unable to find
a solution, though various theories of electricity, galvanism,
and magnetism were advanced. Other persons of authority,
Land-Captain l.elger, the Director of Police ]ann, Dr.
Christen, the President of the Court of Justice, were
present while Commissary Niederberger and Father
Guardian made a careful examination of the house, vdthout
discovering any cause for the disturbances, which still con-
tinued unabated. At length M. Toller demanded of the
police a formal examination, and three of the heads of the
police were chosen to investigate. The Joller family were
bidden to withdraw, and for six days the police remained in
undisturbed possession. At the end of that period, having
neither heard nor seen any sign of the poltergeist, they drew
up a report to that effect, and took their departure. Imme-
dir.tely on the Jollers re-entering the house the phenomena
began afresh. Ridicule was heaped upon the unfortunate
member of council, even by those of his own party, and his
house was in such an uproar that he found it impossible to
go on with his business. Add to this the unwelcome
curiosity of the crowds who flocked to witness the marvels,
and it is not surprising that at length, in October, 1862, M.
Joller left for ever his ancestral home. In the following
spring he succeeded in finding a tenant for the bouse in
Staus, but the pollergeistic outbnmk was not renewed. It
has been thought necessary to relate the above events
somewhat fully, since they afford perhaps the best evidence
extant for the hypothesis of discarnate intelligence operat-
ing in poltergeistic cases. The Joller case is exceedingly
well-attested, not only by the curious crowds who saw the
opening and shutting of windows, and so on, but also by
men of responsibility, members of the national council,
court of justice, and other institutions.
Stead, William Thomas: Journalist and Spiritualist, was
born at Embleton. J:\orthumberland, in 1849. On leaving
school he was apprenticed in the office of a merchant, but
soon drifted into journalism. In 1871 he was editor of the
Darlington Northern Echo, and in 1883 of the Pall 1\fall
Gazelle. In 1890 he founded the Review of Reviews, finding
therein an outlet for his remarkable energy. His journal-
istic zeal led him to espouse many causes~he conducted a
propaganda in favour of the peace movement, deYoted
himself to the interests of the Boers during the South
African \Var, and issued cheap reprints of classical works.
But not the latest of his activities was concerned with his
advocacy of spiritualism. For four years-1893-97-he
conducted a spiritualistic organ, the Borderland, and till
his death gave the weight of his journalistic and personal
in6uence to the movement. Notwithstanding that there
was something of fanaticism in his zeal, and that his ardour
sometimes carried him beyond prescribed limits, he was
still a force to be reckoned with in the sphere of politics,
and Cecil Rhodes, especially, was much influenced by his
opinions. Mr. Stead perished with the sinking of the
Titanic in April, 19t2, since when many spiritualistic
circles claim to have seen and spoken with him. His
daughter, Miss Estelle Stead, has written his life,

Stomach, Seeing with the : A phenomenon frequently
ot?scrved by the followers of Mesmer in their somnambules.
The subject, in a cataleptic state closely resembling death,
would show no signs o! intelligence when questions were
directed to his ears, but if the questions were addressed to
the pit of the stomach, or sometimes fb the finger-tips or
toes, an answer would be immediately forthcoming.
Several such cases are recorded by Dr. Petetin, of Lyons,
who in 1808 published his Electricitt A nimale, and by other
mesmerists. Not only hearing, but seeing, tasting and
smelling were performed by the stomach, independent of
the sensory organs. Petl!tin attributes the phenomenon to
animal electricity and states that objects placed on the
patient's stomach were not seen when they were wrapped in
wax or silk-that is, non-conductors. The best way to
communicate with a patient in the cataleptic state was
for the operator to place his hand on the stomach of the
subject, and address his question to the finger-tips of his
own free hand. This trance phenomenon, as well as
others, may now be referred to suggestion and hyper·

Subterranean Crypts 389
ordinary cerebral processes, tx:cause of the fact that the
brain and physical organism have not yet reached a very
advanced stage of evolution. The soul, in short, is like
an iceberg, with a fraction of its bulk above water, but
having much the greater part submerged. The subliminal
self, again according to Mr. Myers, was in touch with a
reservoir of psychical energy, from which it drew forces
which influenced the physical organism. Thus the in-
spiration of genius, the exaltation of the perceptive and
intellectual faculties in hypnosis, and such exercises as
automatic writing and talking and table-tilting, were
referred to great influxes of these psychical forces rather
than to any morbid tendencies in the agent. Indeed,
abnormal manifestations were, and still are, regarded by
someauthorities as foreshadowing a new type in the progress
of evolution whose faculties sllall tran.~cend those of man
just as our human faculties transcend those of thP- lower
animals. The soul, thus dependent for a very inadequate
expression on a nervous system of limited scope, is at death
freed from its limitations and comes into its heritage of
full consciousness. These hypotheses have been pressed
into service to explain telepathy and communication
between the living and the dead, as well as hallucination,
automatism, and all the hypnotic phenomena. Bnt the
two former, even if they could be demonstrated, would
require to be explained on other grounds, while the others,
whose existence is undisputed, are more generally regarded
as resultant from cerebral dissociation--i.e., the temporary
dislocation of the connecting links between the various
neural systems.
Subterranean Crypts and Temples : SubteYI'anean resorts,
crypts and places of worship, have ever exercised a deep
fascination upon the mind of man. The mysteries of the
Egyptian, and of other peoples were helcl. in underground
eyypts possibly for the purposes of rendering these cere-
monies still more secret and mysterious to the mob. But
also, perhaps, because it was essential to the privacy they
necessitated. The caves of Elephanta, the Catacombs and
similar subleYI'anean edifices will also recur to the mind of
the reader. But the purpose of this article is to refer to
several lesser and perhaps more interesting underground
meeting-places and temples in various parts of the world.
Mr. Hargreavc jcnnin~s quoting Dr. Plot in his Histoyy
of Staffordshil'e, written 10 the third quarter of the seven-
teenth century, gives an interesting account of a supposed
Rosicrucian crypt in that county, which, however, cannot
be found in the work alluded to. It is, however, given
as an interesting imaginative effort. A countryman was
employed, at the close of a certain dull summer's day, in
digging a trench in a field in a valley, round which the
country rose into sombre, silent woods, vocal only with the
quaint cries of the infrequent- magpies. It was some little
time after the sun had sunk, and the countryman was
just about giving over his labour for the day. In one or
two of the last languid strokes of his pick, the rustic came
upon something stony and hard, which struck a spark,
clearly visible in the increasing gloom. At this surprise,
be resumed his labour, and, curiously enough, found a large.
tlat stone in the centre of the field. This field was far
away from any of the farm:~ or " cotes," as tncy were
called, with which the now almost twilight couutry was
sparingly dotted. In a short time, he cleared the stone
free of the grass and weeds which had grown over it; and
it proved to be a large, oblong slab, with an immense iron
ring fixed at one end in a socket. For half an hour the
countryman essayed to stir this stone in vain. At last
he bethought himself of some yards of rope which he had
lying near amongst his tools ; and these he converted,
being ;l.n ingenious, inquisitive, inventive man, into a
tackle-by means of which, and by passing the sling
Subterranean Crypts
round a bent tree in a line with the axis of the stone, he
contrived, in the last of the light, and with much expendi-
ture of toil to raise it. And then, greatly to his surprise,
he saw a large, deep, hollow place, buried in the darkness,
which, when his eyes grew accustomed a little to it, he
discovered was the top-story to a stone staircase, seem-
ingly of extraordinary dept.h, for be saw nothing below.
The country-fellow had not the slightest idea of where this
could lead to; but being a man, though a rustic and·a
clown, of courage, and most probably urged by his idea
that the stair-case led to some secret repository where
treasure lay buried, he descended the first few steps cau-
tiously, and tried to peer in vain down into the darkness.
This seemed impenetrable, but there was one object at a
vast, cold distance below. Looking up to the fresh air,
and seein~ the star Venus--the evening star-shining
suddenly like a planet, in encouraging, unexpected bril-
liancy, although the sky had still some sunset-light in it,
t he puzzled man left the upper ground and descended
silently a fair, though a somewhat broken stair-case.
Here, at an angle, as near as he could judge, of a hundred
feet underground, he carne upon a square landing-place,
with a niche in the wall ; and then he saw a further long
stair-case, descending at right angles to the first stair-case,
and still going down into deep, cold, darkness. The mao
cast a glance upwards, as if questioning the small segment
of light from the upper world which shot down whether he
should continue his search, or desist and return. All was
stillest of the still about him but he saw no reason particu-
larly to fear. So, imagining that he would in some way
soon penetrate the mystery, and feeling in the darkness by
his hands upon the wall, and by his toes first on each step,
he resolutely descended, and he deliberately counted two
hundred and twenty steps. He felt no difficulty in his
breathing, except a certain sort of aromatic smell of
distant incense, that he thought Egyptian, coming up now
and then from below, as if from another though a
subterranean world. " Possibly," thought he-for he had
heard of them-" the world of the mining gnomes ; and
I am breaking in upon their secrets, which is forbidden for
man." The rustic, though courageous, was superstitious.
But, notwithstanding some fits of fear, the countryman
went on, and at a much lower angle he met a wall in his
face ; but, making a tum to the right, with a singular
credit to his nerves, the explorer went down again. And
now he saw at a vast distance below, at the foot of a decpt'r
staircase of stone, a steady thongh a pale light. This
was shining up as if from a star, or coming from the centre
of the earth. Cheered by this light, though absolutely
astounded-nay, frightened-at thus discovering light,
whether natural or artificial, in the deep bowels of the
earth, the man again descended, meeting a thin, humid
t rail of light, as it looked, mounting up the centre line of
the shining though mouldering old stairs, which apparently
had not been pressed by a human foot for very many ages.
He thought now, although it was probable only the v.'ind
in some hidden recess, or creepin~ down some gallery, that
he heard a murmur overhead, ali If of the uncertain rumble
of horses an!l of heavy wagons., or !_umbering wains..Next
moment, all subsided into total stillness ; but the diStant
light seemed to flicker, as if in answer to the strange sound.
Half a dozen times he paused and turned as if he would
remount-almost flee for his life upwards, as he thought;
for this might be the secret haunt of robbers, or the dread-
ful abode of evil spirits. What if. in a few moments, he
should come upon some scene to affright, or alight in the
midst of desperate ruffians. or be caught by murderers.
He listened eagerly. He now almost bitterly repented his
descent. Still the light streamed at a distance, but" still
there was no sound to interpret the meaning of the Light,
Subterranean Crypts 390
or to display the character of this mysterious place, in
which the countryman himself was entangled hopelessly.
The discoverer by this time stood st;ill in fear. Bulat last,
summoning courage, and recommending himself devoutly
to God, he determined to complete his discovery. Above,
be had been working in no strange place : the field be
knew well, the woods were very familiar to him. and his
own hamlet and his family were only a few mile:; distant
He now hastily, and more in fear than through courage.
noisily with his feet descended the remainder of the stairs ;
and the Light grew brighter as he approached, until at
last, at another turn, he came upon a square chamber
built up of large hewn stones. He stopped. silent and
awestruck. Here was a flagged pavement and a somewhat
lofty roof, gathering up into a centre ; in the groins of which
was a rose, carved exquisitely in some dark stone, or in
marble. But what was this poor man's {right when, making
another sudden turn, from between the jambs, and from
under the large archivolt of a Gothic stone portal, light
streamed out over him with inexpressible brilliancy.
shining over every thing, and lighting up the place with
brilliant radiance, like an intense golden sunset. He
started back. Then his limbs shook and bent under him
as he gazed with terror at the figure of a man, whose face
was bidden, as he sat in a studious attitude in a ston!'
chair, reading in a great book, with his elbow resting on
a table like a rectangular altar, in the Light of a large,
a~cicnt iron lamp, suspended by a thi~k chain to the
middle of the roof. A cry of alarm, which he could not
suppress, escaped from the scared discoverer, who involun-
tarily advanced one pace, beside himself with terror. He
was now within the illuminated chamber. As his feet
fell on the stone, the figure started bolt upright from his
seated position as if in awful astonishment. He erected
his hooded head, and showed himself as if in anger about
to question the intruder. Doubtful if what he saw were
a reality, or whether he was not in some terrific dream,
the countryman advanced, without being aware of it,
another audacious step. The hooded man now thrust out
a long at'm, as if in warning, and in a moment the discoverer
perceived that his hand was armed with an iron baton.
and that he pointed it as if tremendously to forbid further
approach. ~ow, however, the poor man, not being in a
condition eithet' to reason or to restrain himself, \>ith a
cry, and in a passion of fear, took a third fatal step; and
as his foot descended on the groaning stone, which seemed
to give way for a moment under him, the dreadful man, or
image, raised his arm hi~h like a machine, and with his
~Uf~:Ch~on struck a prodi.gtous blow upon the lamp. shatter-
mg 1t mto a thousand pteces, and leaving the place in utter
darkness.
This was the end of this terrifying adventure. There
\vas total silence now, far and ncar. Only a Jon", low
roll of thunder, or a noise similar to thunder, see~ed to
begin from a distance, and then to move with snatches,
as if making turns ; and it then rumbled sullenly to sleep
as if through unknown, inaccessible passages. 'What
these were-if any passages-nobody ever found out.
It was only suspected that this hidden place referred in
some way to the Rosicrucians, and that the mysterious
people of that famous order had there concealed some of
their scientific secrets. The place in Staffordshire became
afterwards famed as the sepulchre of one of the brother-
hood, whom, for want of a more distinct recognition or
name, the people chose to call " Rosicrucius," in general
reference to his order ; and from the circumstances of the
lamp, and il;S sudden extinguishment by the figure that
started up, It was supposed that some Rosicrucian had
determined to inform posterity that be had penetrated to
the secret of the making of the ever-burning lamps of the
Subterranean Crypts
ancients,-though, at the moment that he displayed his
knowledge. be took effectual means that no one should reap
any advantage from it.
The Jesuit priests of the early eighteenth century have
left descriptions of the well-known palace of Mitla in
Central America, which lc:~ovc no doubt that in their time
it contained many subterranean chambers and one
especially which apprars to have surpassed all others in the
dreadful uses to which it was put. Father Torquemada
says of the place. " When some monks of my order, the
Franciscan. passed, preaching and shriving through the
province of Zapoteca, whose capital city is Tehuantepec,
they came to a village which was called Mictlan, that is,
underworld (hell). Besides mentioning the large number
of people in the village they told of buildings which were
prouder and more magnificent than any which they had
hitherto seen in New Spain. Among them was the temple
of the evil spirit and living rooms for his demoniacal
servants, and among other fine things there wa.o a hall
with ornamented panels, which were constructed of stone
in a variety of arabesques and other very remarkable
designs. There were doorways there, each one of \vhich
was built of but three stones, two upright at the sides and
one across them, in such a manner that. although these
doorways were very high and broad, the stone sufficed
for their entire construction. They were 'So thick and
broad that we were assured there were few like them.
There was another hall in these buildings, or rectangular
temples, which was erected entirely on round stone pillars
very high and very thick that two gro\m men could
scarcely encircle them with their arms, nor could one of
them reach the fmger-tips of the other. These pillars
were all in one piece and, it was said, the whole shaft of
the pillar measured 5 ells from top to bottom, and they
were very much like those of the church of Santa .Maria
Maggiore in Rome, ver}' slci..llfully made and polished."
Father Burgo~ is more explicit with regard to these
subterraneatr chambers. He says. " There were four cham-
bers above ground ant\ four below. The latter were
arranged according to their pnrpose in such a way that one
front chamber served as chapel and sanctuary for the
idols, which were placed on a great stone which served as
an altar. And for the most important feasts which they
celebrated with sacrifices. or at the burial of a king or great
lord, the high priest instructed the lesser priests or the
subordinate temple officials who served him to prepare the
chapel anrl his vestments and a large quantity of the
incense used by them. And then h~ descended with a
great retinue, which none of the common people saw him
or dared to look in his face. convinced that if they did so
they would fall dead to the earth as a punishment for t~eir
boldness. And when he rntercd the cha:pel they put on
him a long white cotton garment made Like an alb, and
over that a garment shaped like a dalmatic. which was
embroidered with pictures of wild beasts and birds ; and
they put a cap on his head. and <ln his feet a kind of shoe
woven of many-colored feathers. And when he had put
on these garments he walked \Vith solemn mien and
measured step to the altar. bowed low before the idols,
renewed the incense, and then in quite unintelligible
murmurs (muy entre dientcs) he began to converse with
these imal?es• these depositories of infernal spirits, and
continued In this sort of prayer with hideous grimaces and
writhings, uttering inarticulate sounds, which filled all
present with fear and terror, till he came out of that
diabolical trance and told thoS<l standing around the lies
and fabrications which the spirit had imparted to him or
which he had invented himself. When human beings
were sacrificed the ceremonies were multiplied. and the
assistants of the high priest stretched the victim out upon
Subterranean Crypts 391 Succubus
a large stone, bareing his breast, which they tore open with
a great stone knife, while the body writhed in fearful con-
vulsions and they laid the heact bare, ripping it out, and
with it the soul, which the devil took, while they carried
the heart to the high priest that he might offer it to the
idols by holding it to their mouths, among other cere-
monies ; and the body was thrown into the burial-place
of their " blessed." as they called them. And if after the
sacrifice he felt inclined to detain those who begged any
favor he sent them word by the subordinate priests net to
leave their houses till their gods were appeased, and be
commanded them to do penance meanwhile, to fast and to
speak with no woman, so that, until this father of sin had
interceded for the absolution of the penitents and had
declared the gods appeased they did not dare to cross their
threshold.
" The second (underground) chamber was the burial
place of these high priests, and third that of the kings of
Theozapotlan, whom they brought thither richly dfessed
in their best attire, feathers, jewels, golden necklaces, and
precious stones, placing a shield in their left band and a
javelin in the right, just as they used them in war. And
at their burial rites great mourning prevailed; the instru-
ment.-; which were played made mournful sounds ; and
with loud wailing and continuous sobbing they cha.nte~
the life and exploits of their lord until tl1ey laid him on the
structure which they had prepared for this purpose.
" The last (underground) chamber had a second door at
the rear, which led to a dark and gruesome room. This
was closed with a stone slab, which occupied the whole
entrance. Through this door they threw the bodies of the
victims and of the great lords and chieftains who had
fallen in battle, and they brought them from the spot
where they fell, even when it was very far off, to this
burial place ; and so (lreat was the barbarous infatuation
of these Indians that, 1n the belief of the happy life which
awaited them, many who were oppressed by diseases or
hardships begged this infamous priest to accept them as
living sacrifices and allow them to enter through that portal
and roam ai>out in the dark interior of the mountains, to
seek the great feasting-places of their forefathers. And
when anyone obtained this favour the servants of the high
priest led him thither with special ceremonies, and after
they had allowed him to enter through the small door they
rolled the stone be!ore it again took leave of him, and the
unhappy man, wandering in that abyss of darkness, died
of hunger and thirst, beginning alre<~dy in life the pain
of his damnation; and ou account of this horrible abyss
they called this village Liyobaa, The Cavern of Death.
" When later thero fell upon these people the light of the
Gospel, its servants took much trouble to instruct them to
find out whether this error, common to all these nations.
still prevailed, and they learned from the stories which
had been handed down that <1.ll were convinced that this
damp cavern extended more than 30 leagues· underground,
and that its roof was supported by pillars. And there
were people, zealous prelates anxious for knowledge, who,
in order to convince these ignorant people of their terror,
went into this cave accompanied by a large number o.r
people bearing lighted torches and firebrands, ann de-
scended several large steps. And they soon came upon
many buttresses which formed a kind of street. They had
prudently brought a quantity of rope with them to use as
a guiding line, that they might not lose themselves in this
confusing labyrinth. And the putrefaction and the bad
odour and the dampness of the earth were very great and
there was also a cold wind which blew out their torches
And after they had gone a short distance, fearing to be
overpowered by the stench or to step on poisonous reptiles,
of which some had been seen, they resoh·ed to go out again
and to completely wall up this back door of hell. The
four buildings above ground were the only ones which still
remained open. and they had a court and chambers like
those underground; and the ruins of these have lasted
even to the present day."
The vast subten<aiUJan. vaults under the temple hill at
Jerusalem were probably used as a secret meeting-place
by the Templars during their occupation of the Holy City,
and it was perhaps there that the strange Eastern rites of
Baphomet (q.v.) which they later affected were first cele-
brated. In his Recent Discoreries on the Temple Hill the
Rev. James King says, •· On the occasion of a visit to t.he
Noble Sanctuary, the author bad an opportunity of
examining the ancient masonry inside the wall at the
south-east corner, as well as the vast st~blerranean vaults
popularly known as Solomon's stables. A small doorway,
under a little dome at the south-cast comer. admits by a
flight of steps to a small chamber known as the Mosque
of the Cradle of our Lord. from the existence of a hollowed
stone which somewhat resembles a cradle, and a tradition
that the Virgin Mary remained in this chamber for some
time after her purification in the Temple. Passing through
the chamber, the spacious vaults, which extend over an
acre of ground, are reached. These subterra~tean sub-
structures consist of one hundred square piers arranged in
fifteen rows, each pier being five feet wide and composed
of large marginal drafted stones, placed singly over each
other. The rows are connected by semi-circular arches,
the intercolumniations of which range from ten to twenty-
three feet. The door of these vaults is about forty-feet
below the Haram Area, and more than a hundred feet
above the great foundation corner-stone. They are called
Solomon'sStables by the Franks. But the Moslems call the
place, AI Masjed al Kadim, that is, The Old ~osque.
These vaults were used as stables by the Frank kings and
the J<nights Templar, and holes in which rings were
fastened can still be traced on some of the piers.
Since the floor of Solomon's Stables is upwards of a
hundred feet above the foundation stone, it seems highly
probable that there exists another system of vaults below,
for the vast space from the rock upwards is not Likely to be
.filled with solid earth.
Some allusion seems to be made to these vaults in the
writings of Procopius, a Greek historian of the sixth cen-
tury. He was born at C.esarea, in Palestine. about 500
A.D., and as a young man went to Constantinople, where
his eminent talents brought him under the notice of the
Emperor Justinian. In 529 A.D. Justinian built a splendid
church on the Temple Hill, in honour of the Virgin Mary,
and in the writings of Procopius there is a full and detailed
account of the edifice. The historian relates that the
fourth part of the ground required for the building was
wanting towa.rds the south-cast ; the builders therefore
laid their foundations on the sloping ground, and con-
structed a series of arched vaults, in order to raise the
ground to the level of the other J?arts of the enclosure.
This account is eminently descriptive of the subterranean
vaults at the south-ea.o;t portion of the Haram, and, accord-
ing to Mr. Fergusson, the stonc-~ork of these vaults
certainly belongs to the age of Justinian.
Succubus: A demon who takes the shape of a woman. The
Rabbi Elias says that it is mentioned in certain writings
that Adam was visited during a hundred and thirty years
f:)y female demous, and had intercourse with demons,
spirits, spectres, lemurs, and phantoms. Under the reign
of Roger, king of Sicily, a young man, bathing by moon-
light, with several others, thought be saw someone drown-
ing, and hastened to the rescue. Having drawn from the
water a beautiful woman, he became enamoured of her,
married her, and bad by her a child. Afterwards she
Sufllsm 392 Swedenborg, Emanuel
disappeared mysteriously with her child, which made
everyone believe that sbe was a succubus. Hector Boece,
in his history of Scotland, relates that a very handsome
young man was pursued by a female demon, who would
pass through his closed dOOf'"; and offer to marry him. He
complained to his bishop, who enjoined him to fast, pray,
and confess himself, when the infernal visitor ceased to
trouble him. Delancre says that in Egypt, an honest
marechal-ferrant being otcupied in forging during the
night there appeared to him a demon under the shape of a
beautiful woman. He threw a hot iron in the face of the
demon, which at once took to Jligbt.

Suggestion : The sensitiveness to suggestion of the entranced
subject is the characteristic and invariable accompaniment
of the hypnotic state, and is al~o a distinctive feature of
hysteria. Indeed, many modern scientists give to hypno-
tism the name " Suggestion." An abnormal suggestibility
implies some measure of cerebral dissociation. (See
Hypnotism.) In this state every suggestion advanced by
the operator, whether conveyed by word, gesture, or even
unconscious glance, operates with abnormal force in the
brain of the subject, as being relieved from the counter-
excitement of other ideas. In the view of Professor
Pierre Janet all suggestibility implies a departure from
perfect sanity, but this, though perhaps true in the strictest
sense, is somewhat misleading, since all are more· or less
amenable to suggestion. In hypnotism and hysteria,
however, the normal suggestibility is greatly exaggerated,
and the suggestion, meetin~ with no opposition from the
recipient's critical or judicial faculties (because there are
no other ideas with which to compare it) becomes for the
time his dominant idea. The suggestion thus accepted has
a powerful effect on both mind and body, hence the value
of suggestion in certain com~laints is incalculable. The
" miracles " wrought by Chnstian Scientists, the efficacy
of a pilgrimage to Lourdes, the feats of " healing mediums "
all testily to its po\verful effect. Post-hypnotic suggestion
is the terrn applied to a suggestion made while the subject
is entranced, but which is to be carried out after he awakes.
Sometimes an interval of months may elapse between the
utterance of a command and its fulfilment, but almost
invariably at the stated time the suggestion is obeyed, the
recipient is perhaps unaware of the source of his impulse,
not finding adequate logical grounds for the action he
performs, or perhaps automatically lapses into the hypno-
tic state. Auto-suggestion does not proceed from any
extraneous source, but arises in one's own mind, either
spontaneously or from a misconception of existing cir-
cumstances, as in the case of a person who drinks coloured
water under the impression that it is poison, and exhibits
every symptom of poisoning. Auto-suggestion may arise
spontaneously in dream, the automatic obedience to such
suggestion often givin~ rise to stories of " veridical" dreams.
The outbreaks of rebgious frenzy or ecstasy which swept
Europe in the Middle Ages were examples of the results of
mass-suggestion-i.e., mggestic11 made by a crowd, and
much more potent than that made by an individual.
Cases of so-called collective hallucination may be referred
to the same cause. Suggestion is doubtless responsible to
some extent for clairvoyant and mediumistic faculties,
and on the whole enters largely into the study of psychic
science.

Summa Pertectlonfs : (See Arabs.)
Summons by the Dying : It was formerly maintained by tne
theologians that if anyone who was unjustly accused or
persecuted should summon, with his dying breath, his
oppressor to appear before the supreme tribunal, a miracle
would take place, and the person thus summoned would
die on the day fixed by his innocent victim. Thus the
(Grand Master of the Templars) cited the po~ and the
king of France to appear before God on a certam date not
very far ahead, and the story goes on to relate that both
died at the appointed time. Fran~is I., Duke of Brittany,
hired assassins to murder his brother, in 1450. The dying
prince summoned his murderer before the highest of all
courts, and F~an~is shortly expired. Yet another instance
is that of Ferdinand IV., of Spain, who was summoned by
two nobles whom he had condemned unjustly, and he also
respondM reluctantly at the end of...thirty days.
Many more examples could be quoted to show how
firrnly-rooted was this belief in the power of the dying to
.wenge their death by supernatural means. Indeed, it
would be safe to say that, by an inversion, of the usual
order of cause and effect, the popular faith in the efficacy
of the summons was responsible for such evidence as was
forthcoming on its behalf. Fear, and possibly remorse,
acting on the imagination of the guilty judge, might well
cause him to expire at the stated time, and authenticated
accounts of death caused bythese agents are not unknown.
This is further borne out by the fact that if the condemned
man was guilty-that is, if the judge's conscience was
clear- the summons had no effect. Sorcerers, especially.
summoned their judges. but in vain. A story, is told of
Gonzalvo of Cordova, who sentenced a soldier to death for
sorcery. The soldier exclaimed that he was innocent, and
summoned Gonzalvo to appear before God. "Go, then,"
said the judge, " and hasten the proceedings. My brother
who is in heaven, will appear for me." Needless to say,
Gonzalvo did not die, as he believed he had dealt justly
and had no fear of the consequences of the summons.

Swedenborg, Emanuel, I688-177z: One of the greatest
mystics of all time, was born at Stockholm in Sweden on
the zgth January. His father was a professor of theology
at Upsala, and afterwards Bishop of Scara, and in his
time was charged with possessing heterodox opinions.
Swedenborg completed his education at the university of
Upsala in I710, after which he visited England, Holland,
France and Germany. Five years later he returned to his
native town, and devoted much time to the study of
natural science and engineering, editing a paper entitled
Daedalus hyperboreus which dealt chiefiy v.'ith mechanical
inventions. About 1716, Charles XII. appojnted him to
the Swedish Board of .Mines. He appears at this time to
have had many activities. He published various mathe-
matical and mechanical works, and even took part in the
sie~e of Friederickshall in an engineering capacity.
Onginally known as Swedberg, he was elevated to U1e
rank of the nobility by Queen Uirica and changed his name
to Swedenborg. Sitting in the House of Nobles, his political
utterances had great weight, but his tendencies were
distinctly democratic. He busied himself privately in
scientific gropings for the explanation of the universe, and.
published at least two works dealing with the origin of
things which are of no great account, unless as foreshadow-
ing many scientific facts and ventures of the future. Thus
his theories regarding light, cosmic atoms, geology and
physics, were distinctly in advance of his time, and had
they been suitably disseminated could not but have-
infiuenced scientific Europe. He even sketched a flying-
machine, and felt confident that although it was unsuitable
to aerial navigation, if men of science applied themselves
to the problem, it would speedily be solved. It was in
1734 that he published his PYodom11s PhilosophiQJ Ratiocin-
ant,.io de lnjit~ite which treats of the relation of the finite
Swedenborg, Emanuel 393 Swedenborg, Emanuel
to the infinite and of the soul to the body. In this work
he seeks to establish a definite connection between the
two as a means of overcoming the difficulty of their rela-
tionship. The spiritual and the divine appear to him as
the supreme study of man. He ransacked the countries
of Europe in quest of the most eminent teachers and the
best books dealing with anatomy, for he considered that
in that science lay the germ of the knowledge of soul and
spirit. Through his anatomical studies he anticipated
certain modern views dealing with tho functions of the
brain, which are most remarkable.
About the age of fifty-five a profound change overtook
the character of Swedenborg. Up to this time he had been
a scientist, legislator, and man of affairs; but now his
enquiries into the region of sp.iTitual things were to divorce
him entirely from practical matters. His introduction
into the spiritual world, his illumination, was commenced
by dreams and extraordinary visions. He heard wonder·
ful conversations and felt-impelled to found a new church.
He says that the eyes of his spirit were so opened that he
could see heavens and hells, and converse with angels and
spirits : but all his doctrines relating to the New Church
came directly from God alone, while he was reading the
gospels. He claimM that God revealed Himself to him
and told him that He had chosen him to unveil the spiritual
sense of the whole scriptures to man. From that moment
worldly knowledge was eschewed by Swedenborg and he
worked for spiritual ends alone. He resigned his several
appointments and retired upon half pay. Refreshing his
knowledge .of the Hebrew tongue, he commenced his great
works on the interpretation of the scriptures. After the
year 1747 he lived in Sweden, Holland and London, in
which city he died on the 29th of March 1772. He was
buried in the Swedish Church in Prince's Square, in the
parish of St. George's in the East, and in April, 1908 his
bones were removed, at the request of the Swedish govern·
ment, to Stockholm.
There can be no question as to the intrinsic honesty of
Swedetrborg's mind and character. He was neither pre-
sumptuo~.:s nor overbearing as regards ~ doctrines. but
gentle and reasonable. A man of fe"l\' wants, his life was
simplicity itself-his food consisting for the most part of
bread, milk and c.offcc. He was in the habit of lying in a
trance for days together, and day and night had no dis·
tinctions for him. His mighty wrestlings with evil spirits
at times so terrified his servants, that they would seek
the most distant part of the house in refuge. But again
he would converse with benignant angels in broad day·
light. We are badly hampered regarding first-hand
evidence of his spiritual life and adventures-most of
our knowledge being gleaned from other than original
sources.
So far from attempting to found a new church, or other·
wise tamper or interfere with existing religious systems,
Swedenborg was of the opinion that the members of all
churches could belong to his New Church in a spiritual
sense. His works may be divided into : expository
volumes, notably The Apocalypse Revealed, The Apocalypse
E:rplai1ttd, and Arcana Celestia; books. of spiritual phil-
osophy, such as Intercourse between the Soul and the Body
Divine Providence, and Divine Love and Wisdotn ; books
dealing with the hierarchy of supernatural spheres such as
Heaven and Hell and The Last Judgment; and those which
are purely doctrinal, such as The NtJw Jerusalem, TiltS
True Christiau Religiot~, and Ca11011S of the New Church.
Of these his Divine Love and Wisdom is th'e volume which
most succinctly presents his entire religious systems.
God he regards as the Divine Man. Spiritually He consists
of infinite love, and corporeally of infinite wisdom. From
the divine love all things draw nourishment. The sun, as
we know it, is merely a microcosm of a spiritual sun which
emanates from the Creator. This spiritual sun is the
source' of love and knowledge, and the natural sun is the-
source of nature ; but whereas the first is alive, the second
is inanimate. There ~is no connection between the two
worlds of nature and spirit unless in similarity of con-
struction. Love, wisdom, use ;· or end, cause and effect,
arc the three infinite and uncrcated degrees of being in God.
and man respectively. The causes of all things exist in
the spiritual sphere and their effects in the natural sphere,
and the end of all creation is that roan may become the
image of his Creator, and of the cosmos as a whole. This
is to be effected by a love of the degrees above enumerated-
.
Man possesses two v~ssels or receptacles for the contain-
ment of God-the Will lor divine love, and the Under·
standing for divine wisdom. ~fore the Fall, the flow-
of these virtues into the human spirit was perfect, but
through the intervention of the forces of evil, and the sins
of man himself; it was much interrupted~ Seeking to-
restore the connection between Himself and man, God
came into the world as Man ; for if He had ventured on
earth in His unveiled splendour, he would have destroyed
the hells through which he must proceed to redeem man,
and this He did not wish to do, merely to conquer them.
The unity of God is an essential of the Swedcnborgian
theology, and he thoroughly believes that God did not
return to His own place without leaving behind Him a
visible representative of Himself in the word of scripture,.
which is an eternal incarnation, in a three-fold sense-
natural, spiritual and celestial. Of this Swedenborg is-
the apostle ; nothing was hidden from him ; he was awar~
of the appearance and conditions of other worlds, good and
evil, heaven and hell, and of the planets. " The life of
religion," he says, " is to accomplish good." " The kingdom
of heaven is a kingdom of uses." One of the central ideas
of his system is known as the Doctrine of Correspondences.
Everything visible has belonging to it an appropriate
spiritual reality. Regarding this Vaughan says: "The
history of man is an acted parable ; the universe, a temple
covered with hieroglyphics. Bchmcn, from the light which
flashes on certain exalted moments, imagines that he
receives the key to these hidden significances-that he can
interpret the Signatura Rerum. But he does not see-
spirits, or talk with angels. According to him, such
communications would be less reliable than the intuition
he enjoyed. Swedenborg takes opposite ground. • What
I relate,' he would say, • comes from no such mere inward
persuasion. _,.I recount the things I have seen. I do not
labour to recall and to cx:prcss the manifestation made me-
in some moment of ecstatic exaltation. I write you down.
a plain statement of journeys and conversations in the-
spiritual world, which have made the greater part of my
daily history for many years together. I take my stand
upon experience. I have proceeded by observation and
induction as 'strict as that of any roan of science among-
you. Only it has been given me to enjoy an experience
reaching into two worlds-that of spirit, as well as that
of matter.' .....
" According to Swede11borg, all the mythology and the-
symbolisms of ancient times were so many refracted or
fragmentary correspondences-relics of that better day
when every outward object suggested to man's mind its
appropriate divine truth. Such desultory and uncertain.
links between the seen aud the unseen arc ~o many imper-
fect attempts toward that harmony of the two worlds
which he believed himself commissioned to reveal. The
happy thoughts of the artist, the imaginative analogies of
the poet, are exchanged with Swedenborg for an elaborate
system. All the terms and objects in tho natural and
spiritual worlds arc catalogued in pairs. This method
Swedenborg, Emanuel 394
appears so much formal pedantry. Our fancies will not
work to order. Tbe meaning and the ufe with which we
continually inform ouh\>'ard objects-those suggestions
from sight and sound, which make almost every man at
times a poet-are our own creations, are determined by
the mood of the hour, cannot be imposed from without,
cannot be arranged like the nomenclature of a science. As
regards the inner sense of scripture, at all events, Sweden-
borg introduces some such yoke. In that province, how-
ever, it is perhaps as well that those who are not satisfied
with the obvious sense should find some restraint for their
imagination, some method for their ingenuity, some guid-
ance in a curiosity irresistible to a certain class of minds.
If an objector say, • I do not sec why the :\SS should corres-
pond to scientific truth, and the horse to intellectual
truth,' Swedenb01'g will reply, ' This analogy rests on no
fancy of mine, but on actual experience and observation
in the spiritual world. I have always seen horses and asses
present and circumstanced, when, and according as, those
inward qualities were central.' But I do not believe that
it was the design of Swedenborg rigidly to determine the
relationships by which men are continually uniting the
seen and unseen worlds. He probably conceived it his
mission to disclose to men the divinely-ordered corres-
pondences of scripture, the close relationship of man's
several states of being, and to make mankind more fully
aware that matter and spirit were associated, not only in
the varying analogies of ima~Pnation, but by the deeper
affinity of eternal law. In th1s way, he sought to impart
an impulse rather than to prescribe a scheme. His con-
sistent followers will acknowledge that had he lived to
another age, and occupied a different social position, the
forms under which the spiritual world presented itself in
him would have been different. To a large extent, there-
fore, his }..femorable Relatiotu must be regarded as true for
him only-for such a character, in such a day, though
containing principles independent of personal peculiarity
and local colouring. It would have been indeed inconsis-
tent, had the Protestant who (as himself a Reformer)
essayed to supply the defects and correct the errors of the
Reformation-had he designed to prohibit all advance
beyond his own position."
The style of Swedenborg is clear-cut and incisive. He is
never overpowered by manifestations from the unseen.
WheTeaS other mystics are seized by fear or joy by these
and become inc'omprchcnsible, be is in his element, and
when on the very pinnacles of ecstasy can observe the
smallest details wtth a scientific eye. Vie know nowadays
that a great many of his visions do not square \vith scien-
tific probabilities. Thus those which detail his journeys
among the planets and describe t he flora and fauna, let
us say, Qf Mars, can be totally disproved, as we are aware
that such forms of life as he claims to have seen could not
possibly exist upon that planet. The question arises :
Did the vast amount of work accomplished by Swedenborg
in the first half of his life lead to more or less serious mental
derangement ? There have been numerous cases of
similar injury through similar causes. Dut the scientific
exactness and clarity of his mind survived to the last . So
far as he knew science he applied it admirably and with
minute exactness to his system; but just as the science of
Dante raises a smile, so we feel slightly intolerant of
Swedenborg's scientific application to things spiritual. He
was probably the only mystic with a real scientific training;
-oth&S had been adepts in chemistry and kindred studies,
but no mystic ever experienced such a long and arduous
scientific aj)rrenticeship ;.s Swedenborg. It colours the
whole of his system. It would be exceedingly difficult to
say whether he was more naturally a mystic or a scientist.
ln the first part of his life we do not find him greatly
Swedenborg, Emanuel
exercised by spiritual affairs ; and it is only when he Bad
passed the meridian of human days that he seriously
began to consider matters supernatural. The change to
the life of -a mystic, if not rapid was certainly not pro-
longed : what then caused it ? We can only suspect that
his whole tendency was essentially mystical from the
first, and that he was a scientist by force of circumstance
rather than because of any other reason. The spiritual
was constantly simmering within his brain, but, as the
world is ever with us, he found it difficult to throw off t he
superincumbent mass of affairs, which probably tram-
melled him for years. At length the fountains of his spirit
welled up so fiercely that they could no longer be kept
back ; and throwing aside his scientific oars, he leaped into
the spiritual ocean which afterwards speedily engulfed
him. There is perhaps no analogy to be found to his case
in the biography of science. We cannot altogether unveil
the springs of the man's spirituality, but \VC know that they
existed deep down in him. It has often been said that he
was a mere visionary, and not a mystic, in the proper sense
of the word ; but the terms of hiS philosophy dispose of
this contention ; although in many ways it does not square
with· the generally-accepted doctrines of mysticism, it is
undoubtedly one of the most striking and pregnant con-
tributions to it . He is the apostle of t he divine humanity,
and the "' Grand Man " is with him the beginning and
end of the creative purpose. The originality of his system
is marked, and the detail with which he surrounded it
provides his followers of the present day with a. greater
body of teaching than that of probably any other mystical
master.
The following extracts from Swedenborg's works will
assist the reader in g~ining some idea of his eschatology
and general doctrine :-
"The universe is an image of God, and was made for use.
Providence is the government of the Lord in heaven and on
earth. It extends itself over all things, because there is
only one fountain of life, namely, the Lord, whose power
supports all that exists.
" The influence of the Lord is according to a plan, and
is invisible, as is Providence, by which men are not con-
strained to believe, and thus to lose their freedom. The
influence of the Lord passes over from the spiritual to the
natural, and from the inward to the outv.-ard. The Lord
confers his influence on the good and the bad, but the latter
converts the good into evil, and the. true into the false ;
for so is the creature of its wiU fashioned.
" In order to comprehend the origin and progress of this
influence, we must first know that that which proceeds
from the Lord is the divine sphere which surrounds us,
and fills the spiritual and natural world. All t hat pro-
ceeds from an object, and surrounds and clothes it, is
called its sphere.
" As all that is spiritual knows neither time nor space,
it therefore follows that the general sphere or t he divine
one has extended itself from the first moment of creation
to the last . This divine emanation, which passed over
from the spiritual to the natural, penetrates actively and
rapidly through the whole created world, to the last grade
of it , where it is yet to be found, and produces and main-
tains all that is animal, vegetable, and mineral. Man is
continually surrounded by a sphere of his favourite pro-
pensities ; these unite themselves to the natural sphere of
his body, so that together they form one. The natural
sphere surrounds every body of rtaturc, and all the objects
of the three kingdoms. Thus it allies itself to t he spirit ual
world. This is the foundation of sympathy and antipathy,
of union and separation, according to which there are
amongst spirits presence and absence.
" The angel said to me that the sphere surrounded
Swedenborg, Emanuel 395 Switzerland
men more lightly on the back than on the breast. where
it was thicker and stronger. This sphere of influence,
peculiar to mao, operates also in general and in particular
around him by means of the will, the understanding, and
the practice,
" The sphere proceeding from God, which surrounds man
and constitutes his strength, while it thereby operates
on his neighbour and en the whole creation, is a sphere
of peace and innocence ; for the Lord is peace and inno-
cence. Then only is man consequently able to m:.ke ills
influence effectual on his fellow man, when peace and
innocence rule in his heart, and he himself is in union
with heaven. This spiritual union is connected with the
natural by a benevolent man through the touch and the
laying on of hands, by which the inftuence of the inner
man is 't!Jicl:eo~d. prepared,. and imparted. The body
communlcates With others which are about it through the
body, and the spiritual in.fluence diffuses itself chiefly
through the hands, because these are the most outward or
ultimum of man ; and through him, as in the whole of
nature, the first is contained in the last, as the cause in
the effect. The whole soul and the \ovhole body are con-
tained in the hands as a medium of influence. Thus our
Lord healed the sick by laying on of hands, on which
account so many were healed by the touch ; and thence
from the remotest times the consecration of priests and
of all holy things was effected by laying on of. hand.
According to the etymology of the word, hands denote
power.. Man believes that his thoughts and his will
proceed from within him, whereas all this flows into him.
If he considered things in their true form, he would ascribe
evil to hell, and good to the Lord ; he would by the Lord's
grace recognise good and evil within himself, and be happy.
Pride alone has denied the influence of God, and destroyed
the human race."
lieavcn, they speak just as intelligently as the man by
my side. But if they tum away from man, he hears
nothing more whatever, even if they speak close to his
ear. It is also remarkable that several angels ~n speak
to a man ; they send down a spirit inclined to man. and
he thus hears them united."
In another place be says :-" There are also spirits
called natural or corporeal spirits; these have no con·
nection with thought, like the others, but they enter
tb" body, possess all the senses, speak with the mouth,
an4 act with the limbs, for they know not but that every-
thing in that man is their own. These are the spirits
by which men arc possessed. They were, however, sent by
the Lord to hell ; whence in our days there are no more
such possessed ones in existence."
Swedenborg's further doctrines and vistons of Har-
monies, that is to say, of heaven with men, and with
all objects of nature ; of the hannony and correspondence
of all thing with each other; of Heaven, of Hell, and
of the world of spirits ; of the various states of man
after death, etc.-arc very characteristic, important, and
powerful. ••His contemplations of the enlightened inward
eye refer less tO everyday associations and objects of
life (although he not unfrequently predicted future occur-
rences), because his mind was only directed to the highest
spiritual subjects, in which indeed he had attained an
uncommon degree of inward wakefulness, but is there-
fore not understood or known, because he described his
sights so spiritually and unusually by language. His
chapter on the1mmensity of heaven attracts more especially
because it contain" a conversation of spirits and angels
about the planetary system. The planets are naturally
inhabited as well as the planet Earth, but the inhabitants
differ according to the various individual formation of the
planets. These visions on the inhabitants of the planets
agree most remarkably, and almost without exception
with the indications of a clairvoyant whom I treated
magnetically. I do not think that she knew Swetknborg;
to which, however, I attach little importance. The two
seers perceived Mars in quite a different manner. The
magnetic seer only found images of fright and horror.
Swedenborg, on the other hand, describes them as the best
of all spirits of the planetary system. Their gentle, tender,
zephyr-like language. is more perfect, purer and richer in
thought, and nearer to the language of the angels, than
others. These people associate together, and judge each
other by the physiognomy, which amongst them is always
the expression of the thoughts. They honour the Lord
as sole God, who appears sometimes on their earth."
" Of the inhabitants of Venus be says :-' They are of
two kinds ; some are gentle an~ benevolent, others wild,
cruel and of gigantic stature. The latter rob and plunder,
and live by,this means; the former have so great a degree
of gentleness and kindness that they are always beloved by
the good ; thus they often see the Lord appear in their
own form on their earth.' It is remarkable that this
description of Venus agrees so well with the old fable, and
with the opinions and.experiencc we have of Venus.
In his work Heaven and Hell, Swede11borg speaks of in-
fluence and reciprocities- Correspondences. The action
of correspondence is perceptible in a man's counntenance.
In a countenance that has not learned hypocrisy, all
emotions are represer.ted naturaUy according to their
true form ; whence the face is called the mirror of the soul.
In the same way, what belongs to the understanding is
represented in the speech, and what belongs to the will in the
movements. Every expression in the face, in the speech,
in the movements, is called correspondence. By corres-
pondence man communicates with heaven. and he can
thus communicate with the angels if he possess the science
of correspondence by means of thought. In order that
communication may exist between heaven and man,
the word is composed of nothing but correspondences, for
everything in the word is correspondent, the whole and
the parts ; therefore he can learn secrets, of. which he
perceives nothing in· the literal sense; for in the word, there
is, besides the literal meaning, a spiritual meaning--one
of the world, the other of heaven. Swedenborg had his
visions and communications with the angels and spirits by
means of correspondence in the spiritual sense. " Angels
speak from the spiritual world, according to inward thought;
from wisdom, their speech flows in a tranquil stream,
gently and uninterruptedly,-they speak only in vowels
the heavenly angels in A and 0, the spiritual ones in E and
I, for the vowels give tone to the speech, and by the tone
the emotion is expressed ; the interruptions, on the other
hand, corresponds with creations of the mind ; therefore
we prefer, if the subject is lofty, for instance of heaven or
God, even in human speech, the vowels U and 0, etc.
Man, however, is united with heaven by means of the
word, and forms thus the link between heaven and earth,
between the divine and the natural."
" The inhabitants of the Moon are stnall, like childten
of six or seven years old ; at the same time they have the
strength of men like ourselves. Their voice rolls like
thunder, and the sound proceeds from the belly, because
the moon is in quite a different atmosphere from the other
planets."

SpirituaJism.-Two cases of spiritual visitation occurred
in the Swiss Cantons during last century, of so startling a
nature, as to attract the eyes of all Europe. The following
Switzerland 396
briei summary of the Morzine epidemic is collated from
the pages of the Cor1zhill iWagad11e, two or three of the
London daily journals, the Reveu Spirile, and Mr. ·william
Howitt's magazine article entitled," The Devils of Morzine.''
The period of the occurrence was about I86o : the scene,
the parish of Morzine, a beautiful valley of the Savoy, not
more than half a day's journey from the Lake of Geneva.
The place is quite, remote, and had been seldom visited
by tourists before the period named above. Being more-
over shut in by high mountains, and inhabited by a simple,
industrious, and pious class of peasantry, Morzinc might
have appeared to a casual visitor the very centre of health,
peace, and good order_ The first appearance of an abnor-
mal visitation was the conduct of a young girl, who, from
being quiet, modest, and well-conducted, suddenly began
to exhibit what her distressed family and friends supposed
to be the symptoms of insanity. She ran about in the
most singular and aimless way; climbed high trees, scaled
walls, and was found perched on roofs and cornices, which
it seemed impossible for any creature but a squirrel to
reach. She soon became wholly intractable; w:~s given to
:6ts of hysteria, violent laughter, passionate weeping, and
general aberration from her customary modest behaviour.
"
Whilst her parents were anxiously seeking advice in
this dilemma, another and still another of the young
girl's ordinary companions were seized with the same
malady. In the course of ten days the report prevailed,
that over fifty females-ranging from seven years of age to
fifty-had been seized. and were exhibiting symptoms of the
most bewildering mental aberration. The crawling, climb-
ing, leaping, wild singing, furious :swearing, and frantic
behaviour of these unfortunates. soon found crowds of
imitators. Before the tidings of this frightful affliction,
had passed beyond the district in which it originated
several hundreds of women and children, r.nd scores of young
men, were writhing under the contagion. The seizures
were sudden, like the at.tacks : they seldom lasted long,
yet they never seemed to yield to any form of treatment,
whether harsh or kind, medical, religious or persuasive.
The first symptoms of this malady do not seem to have
been noted with sufficient attention to justify one in giving
details which could be considered accurate. It was only
when the number of the possessed exceeded two thousand
persons, and the case was attracting multitudes of curious
enquirers from all parts of the Continent, that the medical
men, priests, and journalists of the day, began to keep
and publish constant records of the progress of the epidemic
One of the strangest features of the case, and one which
most constantly baffled the faculty, was the appearance
of rugged health, and freedom from all physical disease,
which distinguished this malady. As a general rule, the
victims spoke in hoarse, rough tones unlike their own,
used profane language, such as few of them could ever have
beard, and imitated the actions of crawling, leaping, climb-
ing animals with ghastly fidelity. Sometimes they would
roll their bodies up into balls and distort their limbs beyond
the power of the attendant physicians to account for, or
disentangle. Many amongst them were levitated in t.he air,
and in a iew instances, the women spoke in foreign tongues,
manifested high conditions of exaltation, described glorious
visions, prophesied, gave clairvoyant descriptions of absent
persons and distant places, sang hymns, and preached in
strains of sublime inspiration. It must be added, that
these instances were very rare, and were only noticeable
in the earlier stages of the obsession. It is almost needless
co say that the tidings of this horrible obsession attracted
immense multitudes of witnesses, no less than the attention
of the learned and philosophic. When the attempts of
the medical faculty, the church, and the law, had been
tried again and again, and all had utterly failed to modify
the ever-increasing horrors of this malady, the Emperor
Switzerland
of the French, ~he late Louis Napoleon, un~l:er whose pro•
tectorate Morz•ne was then governed, Yielding to the
representations o1 his advisers, actually sent out three
military companies to Morzine, charged with strict orders
to quell the ~isturbances,','on the authority of the Emperor,
or by force If necessary. The result of this high-handed
policy was to increase tenfold the violence of the disease,
and to augment the num_ber of the afilicted, in the persons
':lf many of the very sold•ers who sank under the contagion
which they were expected to quench. The next move of
the baffled ~rench Government, was a spirit~al one ; an
army of pnests, headed by a venerable BIShop, much
beloved in his diocese, being despatched in the quality of
exorcists, at the suggestion of the Archbishop of Paris.
Unhappily this second experiment worked no better than
the first. Respectable looking groups of well-dressed
men, women, and children, would pass into the").:hurches in
reverent silence, and with- all the appearance of health and
piety-but no sooner was the sound of the priest's voice,
or the notes of the organ heard, than shrieks, execrations,
sobbings, and frenzied cries, resounded from different
parts of the assembly. Anxious fathers and husbands
were· busy in carrying their distracted relatives into the
open air, and whether in the church or the home, every
attempt of a sacerdotal character, was sure to arouse the
mania to heights of fury unknown before. The time
came at length, when the good old Bishop thought of a
coup de grace to achieve a general victory over the adver-
sary. He commanded that as many as possible of the
afflicted should be gathered together to hear high mass,
when he trusted that the solemnity of the occasion would
be sufficient to defeat what he evidently believed to be
the combined forces of Satan.
A.ccording to the description cited by William Howitt
in his paper on" The Devils of Morzine," the assemblage in
question, including at least two thousand of the possessed,
and a number of spectators, must have far more faithfully
illustrated Milton's description of Pandemonium than any
mortal scene before enacted. Children and women were
leaping over the seats and benches: clambering up the
pillars, and shrielcing defiance from pinnacles which
scarcely admitted of a foothold for a bird. The Bishop's
letter contains but one remark which seems to offer a
clue to these scenes of horror and madness. He says :
" When in my distress and 80nfusion I accidentally laid
my hand on the heads of these unfortunates, I found that·
the paroxysm instantly subsided. and that however wild
and clamorous they may have been before, the parties so
touched generally sunk down as it were into a swoon, or
deep sleep, and woke up most commonly restored to sanity,
and a sense of propriety." The complete failure of epis·
copal influence threw the Government back on the help of
-medical science. Dr. Constans had, since his first visit, pub-
lished a report, in which he held out hopes of cure if his
advice were strictly followed. He was again commissioned
to do what he could for Morzine. Armed with the powers
of a dictator he returned there, and backed by a fresh
detachment of sixty soldiers, a.brigade of gendarmes and a
fresh cure, he issued despotic decrees, and threatened
lunatic asylums, and in any case deportation for the con-
vulsed. He fined any person who accused others of magic,
or in any way encouraged the prevalent idea ofsupernatural
evil. He desired the cure to preach sermons against the
possibility of demoniacal possession, but this order could
not be carried out by even the most obedient priest. The
persons affected with fits were dispersed in every direction.
Some were sent to asylums and hospit2.ls, anrl many were
simply exiled from Chablais. They were not allowed to
revisit except by very special favour. Mr. William Howitt,
writing in the London Spiritual .Mogazin11 says: "\Ve need
not point to the salient facts of our narrative, or discuss
Sword, Magical 397
the various theories that have been invented to account for
them. . ... It is impossible not to see the resemblance of
the Morzine epidemic with the deroonopathy of the six-
teenth century, and the history of the Jansenist and Ceven-
nes convulsionnaires. . . . . Some of the facts we have
related were often observed in the state of hypnotism. or
nervous sleep, with which physicians are familiar. The
hallucinations of. which we have ~iven instanc;es are too
common to astomsh us. But the likeness of this epidemic
to others that have been observed does not accou.:t for
its symptoms."

Symbolism In Art : " It is in and through symbols," says
Carlyle, " that man, consciously or unconsciously lives,
works, and has his being " ; and his words apply very
pertinently to art in all its branches, for every one of these
represents, in the first place, an attempt to reincarnate
something in nature, and this attempt cannot be made
save with the assistance of some manner of symbolism.
The author uses the arbitrary and sadly restricted symbol
of language whereby to state his conception of life, the
composer employs notes wherewith to body forth his im-
pressions and emotions ; while the painter must needs
be still more symbolical, his art consisting as it does in
expressing distance on a flat surface, and in suggesting
bulk by the practice known technically as modelling. The
sculptor is 2.lso a symbolist, for, while he has at his disposal
a third dimension not vouchsafed to the painter, he tries to
delineate coloured things in a mono-chromatic material ;
while again, it is impossible for him to convey motion or
action as the writer can, and he can only suggest this by
moulding a figure wherein an ephemeral gesture is per-
petrated. Some kind of symbolism, then, is the technical
basis of all the arts ; yet another kind of symbolic signifi-
cance, a deeper and more mysterious one, transpires in them
in many cases. As Coleridge observes, " An idea in the
highest sense of the word, cannot be expressed but by a
symbol " ; and from time immemorial painters and
sculptors have realised this, and have tried to crystalise
abstract ideas by the aid of certain signs, some of them
having quite an obvious meaning, but others being cryptic.
Among the jap2.nese masters of the Akiyoe school, Fuji-no-
Yama was a favourite topic, one which many of them
figured scores of times ; and to Occidental eyes a picture of
this sort is just a picture of a mountain, but to the Japanese
it meant something deeper, Fuji being almost sacred to
them, and its representation in line and colour being a sort
of symbol of patriotic devotion. Then Hokusai, commonly
accounted the greatest master of the school aforesaid,
loved to draw a pot-bellied man reclining at his ease against
cushions ; and this too means little in the East but much
in the West', for in reality it is more than a study in volup-
tuousness, it represents Hotei, the god of oeacc and plenty.
And poor people in the Land of the Rising Sun would buy
a copy of this picture-for those woodcuts which are so
priceless now were mostly sold for a few pence originally,
and were within the reach of the humblest. And they
would hang it on the wall, trusting thus to win the favour
of the deity it personified. Other Japanese, more religious-
ly minded, preferred a picture of a curious male figure
emanating from a plant, and this symbolised the legend
that Buddha rose originally from a lotus; while further,
in many Japanese draperies and the like we find a strange
<!ecoration not unlike a fieur-de-lys, and this was originally
a drawing of the foot of Buddha, a drawing which evolved
Symbolism in Art
throughout the centuries into the form above-named.
The art of the Hindoos is likewise permeated with
symbolism, much of it quite incomprehensible to Euro-
peans ; while the ancient Greek masters also traded in
symbols, one which occurs repeatedly in their output being
the fig-leaf, which represented simply amorousness, and
was a direct reference to the story of the fall of man as
detailed in the book of Genesis. This same symbol is
found occasionally in early Italian works of art and it is
in these, really, that we find symbolism at its apogee ; for
in Italy, more essentially than in any other country, art
was long the handmaiden of the Church, and thus early
Italian painting and sculpture is replete with emblems
referring to the Christian faith. The frequent allusions
in the Old Testament to the hand of God, as the instrument
of his sovereign power, naturally inspired pristine artists
to symbolise the deity's omnipotence by drawing a hand,
sometimes with a cross behind it, sometimes emerging
from clouds; while equally common among the primitives
was the practice of expressing the name of Christ by the
first two letters of his name in Greek, and this errtblem
evolved betimes, assuming divine and intricate forms.
Another familiar Christian symbol, figuring in numerous
sarcophagi and mosaics, is a small picture of a fish ; and
this refers indirectly to baptism but most directly to
Christ, for those who first used this sign observed that the
letters forming the word fish in Greek, IXOYE, when
separated supplied the initials for the five words, Jesus
Christ, Son of God, Saviour. Christ is also represented
sometimes by a picture of a lion, this referring to the phrase
in the Scriptures, " The lion of the tribe of Judah" ; while
the Passion is frequently symbolised by a drawing of a
pelican, tearing open her breast to feed her young. Then
the Holy Ghost is invariably :;uggested by a presentment
of a dove, while the phoenix and the peacock were both
employed as symbols of the Resurrection ; nor does the
symbolism in the art of Italy end here, for an early artist
of that country, doing a picture of a saint, would usually
add some sign having reference to an event in the subject's
career, or to some particular predilection on his part.
Thus, if the saint was famous as a devotee of pilgrimage,
a shell was drawn at his feet ; or, if the doing of penance
was his particular virtue, a skull was figured on some part
of the picture ; while finally, if his life culminated in the
glory of martyrdom, this was hinted at by a sketch of an
axe, a lance or a club.
Mystic symbolism waned in Italy before the eleventh
century was over. Some of the anonymous early Floren-
tines had symbolised love by a great, flaring lamp ; but
with the advent of Titian and Veronese all this sort of
thing was discontinued, and amorous scenes were painted
in realistic fashion. The great medireval masters of
religious art, moreover-men like Ghibcrt and Raphael,
Pinfunichio and Michelangelo- scorned to deal in mere
emblems, and strove to depict biblical scenes with a
ruthless veracity to nature, Ghibert going so far as to try
and introduce a species of perspective into bas-relief. But
meanwhile the practice of the fathers of Italian art had been
taken up in France and in Spain, and more especially in
Germany by Altdorfcr and Albrecht Diirer ; while in
England, too, symbolism of various kinds began to become
very manifest in ecclesiastical architecture and crafts-
manship. The beautiful ~orman Church with its square
tower gave place to a Gothic one with a spire, symbol of
aspiration; while the wood-work was garnished at places
with emblems of the passion-three nails and a hammer,
pincers, ladder, sponge, reed and spear. Besides, gargoyles
commenced to appear on the outsides of Churches, the idea
being that, when the building was consecrated, the devils
took fiight from the interior, and perched themselves on
Symbolism in Art 398
the roof, and this species of symbolism did not pass away
with the middle ages, but was carried on for long afterwards,
as also was the " rose window," symbol of the cro"·n of
thorns.
Table-turning
close of the eighteenth century in engraving, the engraver
of a portrait almost always thinking it necessary to surround
his sitter with allegorical accessories : and to choose a
good example, in many prints of La Fontaine we find a
scene from one of his fables introduced beneath the sub-
ject's visage. A few modern engravers have essayed
something analogous, !'>Ir. \Villiam Strange, for exampley
engraving a tiny portrait of a soldier in the corner of his
familiar plate of Mr. Rudyard Kipling; while reverting
to painting many of the great English masters of portraiture
saw fit to figure, almost in juxtaposition to the sitter,
various items symbolising his tastes or action. Raeburn
was among the last to do this, several of his pictures of great
lawyers being only embellished with bundles of briefs tied
up with red tape; and, though this form of symbolism is
practically dead now, the fact remains that most good
portrait-painters still choose their repoussoir with a view
to its aiding ttlem in adumbrating more completely the
sentiment of the subject in hand. Thus, doing a picture-
of a child, an artist will usually employ a high-pitched
background, this being in some degree emblematic of
youth ; while delineating an olrl man, he will almost cer-
tainly place him in sombre surroundings. And so we see
again, as we saw at the outset, that all art is in a sense
symbolical : and that it is through symbols that it" Lives,
works, and has its being." (Su also Magical Diagrams.)
W.G.B.M.
The churches' suzerainty over art was virtually dead by
the end of the fifteenth century, and thenceforth, during
fully a hundred years. painting found its chief patrons in
various enlightened kings and noblemen. But symbolism
was not altogether ousted accordingly, for the new patrons
were hardly collectors in the usual sense of the term, they
did not buy landscapes to decorate their dwellings-very
few bona fide landscapes were done before the time of
Claude, born in I6oo-and it was m;.inly portraits of
themselves and their families which they sought. So now,
in consequence of this, a new form of symbolism became
very manifest in painting, tbe artist being almost invariably
charged to introduce his patron's coat-of-arms into some
part of the canvas or panel ; and, though this practice
began to wane with the advent of the seventeenth century
-when collecting in the real sense began painters still
continued to trade in emblems of one kind and another.
Even Antoine Watteau (born in 1684), doing a portrait of
the divine Venetian pastellist, Rosalba Cankra, shnwed
her with white roses in her lap ! and anon this rather obvious
symbolism was deepened by the engraver Liotard. for
beneath his print after Watteau he inscribed the beautiful
if sentimental phrase, " La plus belle des fleurs ne dure
qu'un matin." A practice akin to this lingered till the Sympathetic Magic ; (See Magic.)
T
'fable-tmning : A form of psychic phenomena in which a
table is made to rotate, tilt, or rise completely off the
ground by the mere contact of the operator's finger-tips,
and without the conscious exercise of muscular force. The
modus operaJ~di is exceedingly simple. The sitters take
their places round a table, on which they lightly rest their
finger-tips, thus forming a " chain." In a few moments
the table begins to rotate, and may even move about the
room, seemingly carrying the experimenters with it. It
was, and is, in high favour among spiritualists as a means
of communicating with the spiritual world. The alphabet
was slowly repeated, or a pencil was run down the printed
alphabet, the table tilting at the letter which the spirits
desired to indicate. Tbus were dictated sermons, poems,
information regarding the spirit-,..-orld, and answers to
questions put by the sitters. Table-tur,ing, in common
"·ith most spiritualistic phenomena, originated in America.
It rapidly spread to Europe, and early in 1853 reached
Britain, where it soon became immensely popular, and
for the time replaced the earlier method of communication
by means o1 raps. It commended itself to the public
mainly because the services of an expensive profes~ional
medium were not required. In all parts of the country
and in every grade of society the popular craze was practised
with enthusiasm, and in this case as in others the results
increased proportionately \Vith the credibility of the sitters.
In these earlier sta~es of the proceedings the gyrations of
the table were attnbuted entirely to spirit agencies. So
serious did matters become at last that men of science
could no longer ignore the •· manifestations," and were
forced to turn the light of scientific knowledge on the
phenomenon of table-turning and endeavour to explain it on
rational grounds. Foremost among these distinguished
investigators was the chemist Faraday, who showed by
means of simple apparatus of his own devising that the
movements of the table were due to unconscious muscular
action on the part of the sitters, who were thus themselves
the automatic authors of the messages purporting to come
from the spirit world. Faraday's apparatus consisted of
two thin wooden boards with little glass rollers between,
the whole bound together ,,;ith rubber bands, and so con-
trived that the slightest lateral pressure on the upper
board would cause it to slip a little way over the other. A
haystalk or a scrap of paper served to indicate any motion
of the upper board over the lower. The conclusion drawn
from these experiments was that when the sitters believed
themselves to be pressing downward;, they were really
pressing obliquely, in the direction they expected the table
to rotate. Other investigatorS also held that the expecta-
tion of the operators bad a good deal to do with the motions
of the table. Braid pointed out in the appendix to his
Hypnotic Theraperllics that some one generally announced
beforehand the direction in which the table would rotate.
and so encouraged the expectation of the operators.
Another authority, Dr. W. B. Carpenter, shared the same
view, as did a committee of four medical men who pub-
lished their experiences of table-tur11ing in the i\lt>dical
Times and Gazette Among the earliest investigators of the
phenomena of table-turning were count de Gasparin and
Professor Thury of Geneva, who held seaP.ces, and were
satisfied that the movements resulted from a force radiating
from the operators, to which they gave the name of'' ectenic
force." There were others, however, who were less rational
in their attempts to explain the phenomenon. The public
were on the whole indisposed to accept the conclusions of
Faraday and the rest. They preferred the more popular
spiritualistic explanalions or the pseudo-scientific theories
of such men as Dr. l<och, who believed that the .. chain "
of operators formed a sort of electric battery which supplied
the table with vital energy or, as it was called, •· electro-
odyllic " force, and made it respond to the will as though
it were a part of the human body. Other explanations
offered were odic force, galvaJtism, animal magnetism,
and, strangest notion of all, the rotation of the earth ! In
an anonymous pamphlet published during the tabie-
turni11g epidemic and entitled Table-talki11g considered in
contrection with the dictates of reason and common sense, the
conclusions of Faraday are ridiculed, and an electrical.
Table-turning 399 Taigheirm
theory advanced, in such a way, nowever, as to show that
the writer is quite ignol"ant of hiS subject. Another pamph-
let. also anonymous, entitled Tabte-tuming by Animal
J.Iag.utism demonstrated ascribes the phenomenon to mag-
netism, ana bases its suppositions on the results of some
experiments in which the table was isol2.ted by glass or
gutta-percha. Dr. Elliotsorc and the other believers in a
mesmeric ·• ftuid " which would affect inanimate objects
as well as living being.;, saw in table-turning a support for
their views. The Rev. G. Sandby and the Rev. C. H.
Townshend, claimed to have experienced a fe~ling ol
fatigue after a table-turning seance as though they bad been
hypnotising someone. They also felt a tingling sensation
in their finger-tips, and Townshend suggested that spirit
rappings may be caused by a " disengagement of Zoogen
from the System." n~·. Elliotson himself followed with an
admission that the phenomenon was not explicable within
the bounds of muscular force. There was another set,
mainly composed of Evangelical clergymen, \vho credited
the whole business to Satanic agency. The Rev. N. S.
Godfrey, the Rev. E. Gillson, and others held seances in
which the ·• spirits " confessed thcmeslves to be either
the spirits of worthless persons of evil inclination, or
devils, both of which confessions caused the reverend
gentlemen to denounce the whole practice of table-tumi11g.
One of them remarks, npropos of Faraday's experiments,
that the phenomena "appear to be whatever the 'investi-
gator supposes them to be," a saying which aptly charac-
terises their own attitude.
Camille Flammarion, whose exhaustive experiments and
scientific attainments give to his opinion considerable
weight, has offered an explanation of the various phases
of table-turniug phenomena. Simple rotation of the table
he ascribes to an unconscious impulse given by the operators
and other movements of the table while the fingers of the
sitters rest upon it arc ascribed to similar causes. The
tilting of the table on the side furthest away from the
operator can also be explained by muscular action. But
vibrations in the wood of the table, or its levitation under
the fingers, or, to a still greater extent, its rotation without
contact of the operator's hands, be attributes to a force
emanating from the body, and, in the latter case, capable
of acting at a distance by means of ether-waves. This
force, the result of a cerebral disturbance, is greater than
that of the muscles, as is seen by the levitation of tables
so weighted that the combined muscular strength of the
operators would not suffice to lift it. To the dictating of
messages and other intelligent manifestations he would
also ~ve an origin in this psychic force, which is perhaps
identical with Thuc-y's " ectenic" force, or " psychode,"
and which is obedient to the will and desires, or even, in
some cases. the sub-conscious will of the operator. The
hypothesis of spirits he does not consider necessary. It
is possible, however, that fraud may have crept into the
seances of M. Flammarion, as it has done in so many other
cases. And there are thOSt~ among the most profound
students of psychic research who find in unconscious
muscular action and deliberate fraud a satisfactory explana-
tion of the phenomena.
Taboo, Tabu or Tapu : A Polynesian word meaning " pro-
hibited " and signifying a prohibition enforced by religious
or magical power, which bas come to be applied to similar
usages among savage peoples all over the world. Taboo; or
prohibition is enforced in the cases of sacred things and
unclean things. In the first instance, the taboo is placed
on the object because of the possession by it of inherent
mysterious power. But, taboo may be imposed by a chief
or priest. It aims at the prott:ction of important individ-
uals ; the safeguarding of the weak, women, children and
slaves from the magical influence of more highly-placed
individuals ; :1.gamst danger mcurred by handling or
coming in contact with corpses ; or eating certain foods ;
and the securing of human beings agaim;t the power of
supernatural agencies, or the depredations of thieves.
Tab{)() m11.y ?.!so be sanctioned by social u~ or instinct.
The violation of a tab{)() makes the offeuder biDISeU taboo,
for it is characteristic of the tab{)() that it is tra.nsmis.-ible,
but can be thrown off by magical or purificatory cere-
monic:<. It may last for a short period, or be imposed in
perpetuity. It may be said, generally speaking, that
tJ:a practice of taboo was instituted through human instinct
for human convenience. This applies of course merely to
the most sin1ple type of tab{)(). It is, for example, for-
bidden to reap or steal the patch of corn dedicated to an
agricultural deity, for the simple reason that his wrath
would be incurred by so doing. Similarly it is tab{)() to
devour the flesh of the totem animal of the tribe, except
in special circumstances with the object of achieving
communion with him. It is taboo to interfere in any
manner with the affairs of the shamans or medicine-men :
this again is a type of the imposed taboo for the convenience
of a certain caste. It is prohibited to marry a woman of
the same totem as oneself, as all the members of a totemic
band arc supposed to be consanguineous, and such a union
might incur the wrath of the patron deity. A very strict
taboo is put upon the beholding of certain ritual instru-
ments belonging to some barbarian t ribes, but this only
applies to women and uninitiated men : the reason for
such taboo would be that it was considered degradation for
women to behold sacred implements. Taboo, if it does not
spring directly from the system known as totemism, was
strongly influenced by it-that is, many intricate tab{)()s
arose from the totemic system. We have also the taboo
of the sorcerer, which in effect is merely a spell placed upon
a certain object, which makes it become useless to others.
Taboo, or its remains, is still to be found in strong force
even in the most civilised communities, and from its use
the feeling of reverence for ancient institutions and those
who represent them is undoubtedly derived.

Taigheirm : A magical sacrifice of cats to the infernal spirits,
formerly practised in the Highlands and Islands of Scot-
land. It is believed to have been originally a ceremony of
sacrifice to the subterranean gods, imported from more
northern lands, which became in Christian times an invoca-
tion of infernal spirits. The word " Taigheirm " signifies
either an armoury, or the cry of a cat, according to the
sense in which it is used. A description of the ceremony,
which must be performed with black cats, is given in
Horst's De-uteroscopy: " After the cats were dedicated to
all the devils, and put into a magico-sympathetic con-
dition by the shameful things done to them, and the
agony occasioned them, one of them was at once put upon
the spit, and, amid terrific howlings, roasted before a slow
fire. The moment that tlu: howls of one tortured cat
ceased in death, another was put upon the spit, for a
minute of interval must not take place if they would control
hell ; and this continued for the four entire days and nights.
If the exorcist could hold it out still longer, and even till
his physical powers were absolutely exhausted. he must
do so." Vllhcn the horrible rites had been continued for a
time the demons began to appear in the shape of black
cats, who mingled their dismal cries with those of the
unfortunate sacrifices. At length a cat appeared of
larger size and more frightful aspect than the others, and
the time had come for the exorcist to make known his
demands. Usually he asked for the gift of second sight,
but other rewards might be asked for and received. The
Tale:; of Terror 400 Talisman
last Taigheirm was said to have been held in Mull about
the middle of the seventeenth century. The exorcists were
Allan Maclean and his assistant Lachlain l\IIaclean, both
of whom received the second sight. Of this particular
ceremony Horst says: " The infernal .spirits appeared
some in the early progress of the sacrifices, in the shape of
black cats. The first who appeared during the sacrifice,
after they h2d cast a furious glance at the sacrifices, said-
Lachlain Oer, that is, • Injurer of Cats.' Allan, the chief
-operator, warned Lachlaio, whatever he might see or hear,
not to waver, but to keep the spit incessantly turning.
At length the cat of monstrous $ize appeared ; and after
it had set up a horrible howl, said to Lachlain Oer, that if
he did not cease before their largest brother came he would
never see the face of God. Lachlain answered that he
would not cease till he bad finished his work if all the
<)evils in hell came. At the end of the fourth day, there
sat on the end of the beam in the roof of the barn a black
cat with fi're·flaming eyes, and there was heard a te,.ific
howl quite across the straits of Mull into .Mowen." By
this time the elder of the two men was quite exl1austed,
and sank down in a swoon, but the younger was sufficiently
self-possessed to ask for wealth and prosperity, which both
received throughout their life·time. Shortly before this,
Cameron of Lochiel received at a Taigheirm a small silver
shoe which, put on the foot of a new·bom son of his family,
would give courage and fortitude to the child. One boy,
however, had at his birth, a foot too large for the shoe,
a defect inherited from his mother, who was not<!. Cameron.
His lack of the magically bestowed courage was apparent at
Sheriffmuir, where he fied before the enemy.

Talisman ; An.inanimate object which is supposed to possess
a supernatural capacity o£ conferring benefits or powers
in contradistinction to the amulet (q.v.), the purpose of
which is to ward off evil. It was usually a disc of mdal
or stone engraved with astrological or magical figures.
Talismans were common in ancient Egypt and Babylon.
The virtues of astrological talismans were as follows : The
astrological figure of Mercury, engraven upon silver, which
is the corresponding metal, and according to the pre-
scribed rites, gave success in Merchandise ; that of Mars
gave victory to the soldier; that of Venus, beauty, and
so of the rest. All such talisma1:s likewise are more power-
ful in the hour t>f their planet's aseendency. There are
three general varieties of these potent charms : x. The
astronomical, having the characters of the heavenly signs
or constellations. 2. The magical, with extraordinary
figures, superstitious words, or the names of angels. 3· The
mixed, engraven with celestial signs and barbarous words.
To these, Fosbrook, in his Encycloptedia of Antiquities,
adds two others :- 4. The sigilla planelarum, composed of
Hebrew numeral letters, used by astrologers and fortune-
tellers ; and 5· Hebrew names and characters. As an
example of the most powerful of the latter, may be men·
tioned the sacred name o£ Jehovah. The famous tephillin
or phylacteries, used in Jewish devotion, and which were
bound on the bead, the arm, and the hand, may be regarded
as tali.smans, and they were the subject of many traditional
ceremonies. We may also mention the me;~:u;~:oth or
schedules for door-posts, and another article of this des-
cription mentioned in the following quotation from the
Talmud:-'' Whoever has the telphillin bound to his
head and arm, and the tsitsith thrown over his garments,
and the me.zuza fixed on his door·post, is protected from
sin."
Writing of talismans in his Occult Sciences, :\ir. A. E.
Waite says:
" I. The Talisman of the Sun must be composed of a
pure and fine gold, fashioned into a circular plate, and
well polished on eith~r side. A serpentine circle, enclosed
by a pentagram must be engraved on the obverse side with
a diamond-pointed graving tool. The reverse must bear
a human head in the centre of the six-pointed star of
Solomon, which shall itself be surrounded Vl'ith the name
of the solar intelligence Pi-Rhc, written in the characters
of the )!agi. This talisman is supposed to insure to its
bearer the goodwill of influential persons. It is a pre·
scrvative against death by heart disease, syncope, aneurism,
and epidemic complaints. It must be composed on a
Sunday during the passage of the moon through Leo, and
when that luminary is in a favourable aspect with Saturn
and the Sun. The consecration consists in the exposure
of the talisman to the smoke of a perfume composed of
cinnamon, incense, saffron, and red sandal, burnt with
laurel-wood, and twigs of dessicated heliotrope, in a new
chafing-dish, which must be ground into powder and buried
in an isolated spot, after the operation is finished. The
talisman must be afterwards encased in a satchel of bright
yellow silk, which must be fastened on the breast by an
mterlaced ribbon of the same material, tied in the form
of a cross. In all cases the c~remony should be preceded
by the conjuration of the Four, to which the reader has
already been referred. The form of consecration, accom·
panied by sprinkling with holy water, may be rendered in
the iollowing manner :-
.. In the name of Elohim, and by the spirit of the living
waters, be thou unto me as a sign of light and a seal of will.
•· Presenting it to the smoke of the perfumes :-By
the brazen serpent before which fell the serpents of fire,
be thou unto me as a sign of light and a seal of Will.
" Breathing seven times upon the lalism~n :-By the
firmament and the spirit of the voice, be thou unto me as a
sign of light and a seal of will.
.. L;:.stly, when placing some grains of purified earth or
salt upon the pentacle :-In the name of the salt of the
earth and by virtue of the life eternal, be thou unto me
as a sign of light and a seal of will.
" II. The Talisman of the !\loon should be composed of
a circular and well-polished plate of the purest silver, being
of the dimensions of an ordinary medal. The image of a
crescent, enclosed in a pentagram, should be graven on the
obverse side. On the reverse side, a chalice must be
encircled by the duadic seal of Solomon, encompassed by
the letters of the lunar genius Pi-Job. This talisman is
considered a protection to travellers, and to sojourners in
strange lands. It preserves from death by drowning, by
epilepsy, by dropsy, by apoplexy, and madness. The
dangers of a violent end which is predicted by Saturnian
aspects in horoscopes of nativity, may be r~moved by its
means. It should be composed on a .Monday, when the
moon is passing through the first ten degrees of Capricornus
or Virgo, and is also well aspected with Saturn. Its con·
secration consists in exposur~ to a perfume composed of
white sandal, camphor, aloes, amb1!r, and pulverised seed
of cucumber, burnt with dessicated stalks of mugwort,
moonwort, and ranunculus, in a new earthen chafing-dish,
which must be reduced, after the operation, into powder,
and buried in a deserted spot. The talisman must be
sewn up in a satchel of white silk, and fixed on tile breast by
a ribbon of the same co!J:>ur, interlaced and tied in the form
of a cross.
" III. The Talisman of Mars must be composed of a
well-polished circular plate of the finest iron, and of the
dimensions of an ordinary medal. The symbol of a sword
in the centre of a pentagram must be engraved on the
obverse side. A lion's head surrounded by a six-pointed
star must appear on the reverse face, with the letters of the
name Erotosi, the planetary genius of :\lars, above the
Talisman 401
outer angles. This talisman passes as a preservative
against all combinations of enemies. It averts the chance
of death in brawls and battles, in epidemics and fevers,
and by corroding ulcers. It also neutralizes the peril o£ a
violent end as a punishment for crime when it is foretold
in the horoscope of the nativity.
"This talisman must be composed on a Tuesday, during
the passage of the moon through the ten first degrees of
Aries or Sagittarius, and when, moreover, it is favourably
aspected with Saturn and Mars. The consecration con.~ists
in its elCposure to the smoke of a perfume composed ofdried
absinth and rue, burnt in an earthen vessel which has
never been previously used, and which must be broken into
powder, and buried in a secluded place, when the operation
is completed. Finally, the talisman must be sewn up in a
satchel of red silk, and fastened on the breast with ribbons
of the same material folded and knotted in the fore::. of a
cross.
"IV. The Talismat: of Mercury must be formed of a
circular plate of fixed quicli:silver, or according to another
account of an amalgam of silver, mercury, and pewter, of
the dimensions of an ordinary medal, well-polished on both
sides. A winged caduceus, having two serpents twining
about it, must be engraved in the centre of a pentagram
on the obverse side. Tile other must bear a dog's head
within the star o! Solomon, the latter being surrounded
with the name of the planetary genius, Pi-Hermes, written in
the alphabet of the Magi. This ttdisman must be composed
on a Wednesday, when the moon is passing through the
ten first degrees of Gemini or Scorpio, and is well aspected
with Saturn and Mercury. The consecration cons1sts in
its exposure to the smoke of a per-fume composed of ben-
zoin, macis, and storax, burnt with the dried stalks of the
lily, the narcissus, fumitory, and marjolane, placed in a
clay chafing-dish which has never been devoted to any
other purpose, and which must, after the completion of
the task, be reduced to powder and buried in an undisturbed
place. The Talisma11 of Mercury is judged to be a defence
in all species of commerce and business industry. Buried
under the ground in a house of commerce, it will draw
customers and prosperity. It preserves all who wear it
from C,Pilepsy and madness. It averts death by murder
and p01son ; it is a safeguard against the schemes of treason
and it procures prophetic dreams when it is worn on the
head during sleep. It is fastened on the breast by a ribbon
of purple silk folded and tied in the form of a cross, and
the talisman is itself enclosed in a satchel of the same
material.
"V. The Talisman of Jupiter must be formed of a
circular plate of the purest English pewter, having the
dimensions of an ordinary medal, and being highly polished
on either side. The image of a four-pointed crown in the
centre of a pentagram must be engraved on the obverse
side. On the other must be the head of an eagle in the
centre of the six-pointed star of Solomon. which must be
surrounded by the name of the phmetary genius Pi-Zeous,
written in the arcane alphabet.
" This talisman must be composed on a Thursday,
during the passage of the moon through the first ten
degrees of Libra, and when it is also in a favourable aspect
with Saturn and Jupiter. The consecration consists i 1
its exposure to the smoke of a perfume composed of incense,
ambergris, balm, grain of Paradise, saffron, and macis,
which is the second coat of the nutmeg. These must be
burnt with wood of the oak.poplar,fig tree, and pomegranate,
and placed in a new earthen dish, which must be ground
into powder, and buried in a quiet spot, at the end of the
ceremony. The talisntatt must be wrapped in a satchel of
sky-blue silk. suspended on the breast by a ribbon of the
same material, folded and fastened in the form of a cross.
Talisman
"The Talisman of Jupiter is held to attract to the wearer
the benevolence and sympathy of everyone. It averts
anxieties, favours honourable enterprises, and augments
well-being in proportion to social condition. It is a pro-
tection against unforeseen accidents, and the perils of a
violent death '"'hen it is threatened by Saturn in the horo-
scope of nativity. It also preserves from death by affec-
tions of the liver, by inflammation of the lun~s. and by that
cruel affection of the spinal marrow, which IS termed tabes
dcwsalis in medicine.
- "VI. The Talisman of Venus must be formed of a
circular plate of purified and well-polished copper. It
must be of the ordinary dimensions of a medal, perfectly
polished on both its sides. It must bear on the obverse
face the letter G inscribed in the alphabet of the Magi, and
enclosed in a pentagram. A dove must be engraved on
the reverse, in the centre of the six-pointed star, which
must be surrounded by the letters which compose the
name of the planetary Genius Suroth. This talisman must
be composed on a Friday, during the passage of the moon
through the first ten degrees of Taurus or Virgo, and when
that luminary is well aspected with Saturn·and Venus. Its
consecration consists in its exposure to the smoke of a
perfume composed of violets and roses, burnt with olive
wood in a new earthen chafing-dish, which must be ground
into powder at the end of the operation and buried in a
solitary spot. The talisma" must, finally, be sewn up in a.
satchel of green or rose-coloured silk, which must be
fastened on the breast by a band of the same material,
folded and tied in the form of a cross.
The Talisman of Venus is accredited with extraordinary
power in cementing the bonds of love and harmony between
husbands and wives. It averts from those who wear it the
spite and machinations of hatred. It preserves women
from the terrible and fatal diseases which are known as
cancer. It averts from both men and women all danger
of death, to which they may be accidentally or purposely
exposed. It counterbalances the unfortunate presages
which may appear in the horoscope of nativity. Its last
and most singular quality is its power to change the ani-
mosity of an enemy into a love and devotion which will be
proof against every temptation, and it rests on the sole
condition that such a person should be persuaded to
partake of a liquid in which the talisma1~ has been dipped.
"VII. The Talisman of Saturn must be composed of a
circular plate of refined and purified lead, being of the
dimensions of an ordinary medal, elaborately polished.
On the obverse side must be engraven with the diamond-
pointed tool which is requisite in all these talismanic
operations, the i~Rge of a sickle enclosed in a pentagram.
The reverse side must bear a bull's head, enclosed in the
star of Solomon, and surrounded by the mysterious letters
which compose, in the alphabet of the Magi, the name
of the planetary Genius Tempha. The person who is
intended to wear this talisman must engrave it himself,
without witnesses, and without taking any one into his
confidence.
" This talisma11 must be composed on a Saturday when
the moon is passing through the first ten degrees of Taurus
or Capricorn, and is favourably aspected with Saturn. It
must be consecrated by exposure to the smoke of a perfume
composed of alum, assa-fretida, cammonee, and sulphur,
\lrhich must be burnt with cypress, the wood of the ash
tree, and sprays of black hellebore, in a new earthen
chafing-dish, which must be reduced into powder at the
end of the performance, and buried in a deserted place.
The talisman must, finally, be sewn up in a satchel of
black silk and fastened on the breast with a ribbon of the
same material, folded and tied in the form of a cross. The
Talisman of Saturn was affirmed to be a safeguard against

poLwn. or ambush. If the head of the army in war-time
were to bury the Talisman of Saturn in a place which it was
feared might fall into the bands of the enemy, the limit
assigned by the presence of the talisman could not be over-
stepped by the opposing host, which would speedily with-
draw in discouragement, or in the face of a determined
assault." (See Ceremonial Magic.)
Talmud, The: From the Hebrew Iammi, to learn; the
name of the great code of Jewish civil and canonical law.
It is divided into two portions-the Mishna and the
Gemara ; the former constituted the text and the latter
was a commentary and supplement. But besides being
the basis of a legal code, it is also a collection of Jewish
poetry and legend. The Mishna is a development of the
laws contained in the Pentateuch. It is divided into six
sedarim or orders, each containing a number of tractates,
which arc again divided into peraqim or chapters. The
sedarim are: (r) Zcraim, which deals with agriculture;
(2) Moed, with festivals and sacrifices; (3) Nashim, with
the law regarding women : (1) Nezaqin, with civil law;
(5) Qodasllim, with the sacrificial law ; and (6) Tohorotl~
or Tah, with purifications. The Mislma was supposed to
have been handerl down by Ezra and to be in part
the work of Joshua, David or Solomon, and originally
communicated orally by the Deity in the time of Moses.
There are two recensions-the Talmud of Jerusalem, and
the Talmud of Babylon; which latter besides the sedarim
mentioned contains seven additional treatises which are
regarded as extra-canonical. The first in supposed to·have
been finally edited towards the close of the lourth century
A.D., and the second by Rabbi Ashi, President of the
Academy of Syro in Babylon, somewhere in the fourth
century. Though revised from time to time before then,
both versions have been ~reatly corrupted through the
interpolation of gross traditions. The rabbinical decisions
in the ~1ishna are entitled helacoth and the traditional
narratives haggadqh. The co~mogony of the Talmud
assumes thM the univ~>rse has been developed by means
of a series of cataclysms : world after world was destroyed
until the Creator made the present globe and saw that itwas
good. In the wonderful treatise on the subject by Deutsch
which first appeared in the Quarterly Review in 1867, and
is reprinted in his Literary Remai11s, the follo,,;ng passage
appears:-
" The how of the creation was not mere matter of specu-
lation. The co-operation of angels, whose existence was
warranted by Scripture, and a whole hierarchy of whom
had been built up under Persian influences, was
distinctly denied. In a discussion about the day of their
creation, it is agreed oa all hands that there were no angels
at first, lest men might say, 1
Michael spanned out the
firmament on the south, and Gabriel to the north.' There
is a distinct foreshadowing ol the Gnostic Demiurgos-
that antique link between the Divine Spirit and the world
of matter-to be found in the Talmud. What with Plato
were the Ideas, with Philo the Logos, with the Kabalists
the • World of Azilutb,' what the Gnostics called more
emphatically the wisdom (sophi ~).or power (dunamis), and
Plotinus the nous, that the Talmudical authors call Meta-
tion. There is a good deal, in the post-captivity Talmud,
about the Angels, borrowed frOm the Persian. The
Archangels or Angelic princes are seven in number, and
their Hebrew names and functions correspond almost
exactly to those of their Persian prototypes. There are
also hosts of ministering an~els, the Persian Y azalas, whose
.functions, besides that of bemg messengers, were two-fold-
to praise God and to be guardians of :man. In their
.first capacity they arc daily created by God's breath out
of a stream of fire that rolls its waves under the supernal
throne. In their second, two of them accompany every
man, and for every new good deed man acquires a new
guardian angel, who always watches over his steps. \Vhen
a righteous man died, three hosts of angels descend from
the celestial battlements to meet him. One says (in
the words of Scripture), 1
He shall go in peace' ; the
second takes up the strain and says, • \Vho has walked in
righteousness ' ; and the third concludes, • Let him come
in peace and rest upon his bed.' In like manner, when the
wicked man passes away, three hosts of wicked angels are
ready to escort him, but their address is not couched in any
spirit of consolation or cncourngement."
It would be impossible in this place to give a resum~
of the traditional matter contained in the Talmud. Suffice
it to say that it is of great extent. It has been considered
by some authorities that a great many of the traditional
tales have a magical basis, anrl that magical secrets are
contained in them ; but this depends entirely upon the
interpretation put upon them, and the subject is one which
necessitates the closest possible study.
Tam o' Shantor: (See Scotland.)
Tannhauser : A mediooval German legend which relates
how a minstrel and knight of that name, passing by the
Horselberg, or Hill of Venus, entererl therein in answer to a
call. and remained there with the enchantress, living an
unholy life. After a time he grew weary of sin, and
longing to return to clean living, he forswore the worship
of Venus and left her. llt! then made a pilgrimage to
Rome, to ask pardon of the Pope, but when he was told
by Urban IV., himself that the papal staff would as soon
blossom as such a sinner as Tamt!lauser be forgiven, he
returned to Venus. Three days later, the Pope's staff did
actually blossom, and he sent messengers into every country
to find the despairing minstrel, but to no purpose, Ta1m-
Muser had disappeared. The story has a mythological
basis which has been laid over by medireval Christian
thought, and the original hero of which has been displaced
by a more modern personage, just as the Venus of the
existing legend is the mythological Venus only in name.
She is really the Lady Holda, a German earth-goddess.
Tan~thauser was a " minnesinger" or love-minstrel of the
middle of the thirteenth century. He was very popular
among the minnesingcn; of that time and the restless and
intemperate tife he led probably marked him out as the
hero of such a legend as has been recounted. He was the
author of many ballads of considerable excellence, which
are published tn the second part of t11e " Minnesinger"
(Von der Hagen, Leipsic, 1838) and in the sixth volume of
Haupt's Zeitschrift Jt{r deutschss Allhertmn. The most
authentic version of this legend is given in Uhland's
Alte !Joch tmd 11iederdeutsche Volkslieder (Stuttgart, x845).

" inspired " lecturer on spiritualism, i:l which capacity
she soon: became famous throughout America. Coming
to Britain in 1873 she was warmly received by the spiritual-

and the comparative clarity of their ideas.
Tarot, or Tarots, is the French name for a srecies of playing-
cards, originally used for the purpose o divination, and
still employed by fortune-tellers. Tarot cards, however.
Tarot 403 Tears on Shutters
form part of an ordinary pack in certain countries of
southern Europe, whence the name of tarocchi given to an
Italian game. The derivation of the word is uncertain.
One suggestion is that these c:uds were so called because
they were tarotees on the back ; that is, marked with plain
or dotted lines crossing diagona\ly. ConJirmation of this
theory may be found in the German form of the word ;
a Iarock-karle being a card chequered on the back. Not
improbably, however, there is here a confusion between
cause and effect.
De I' Hoste Ranking, who dismisses as " obviotisly
worthless" the explanations of Count de Gebelin, Vaillant
and Mathers, refers the name to the Hungarian Gipsy tar, a
pack of cards, and thence to the Hindustani ta-u. The figures
on these cards arc emblematic, and arc believed by many
to embody the esoteric religion of ancient Egypt ami India ;
but on this subject there is much difference of opinion.
" The tarot pack most in use," observes Ranking, •· con-
sists of seventy-eight cards, of which twenty-two are more
properly known as the tarots, and arc considered as the
' keys ' of the tarot ; these correspond with the twenty-
two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, or, according to
Falconnier and to Margiotta, with the ' alphabe~ of the
.Magi.' The suits are four : waads, sceptres, or Clubs,
answering to diamonds ; cups, chalices, or goblets, answering
to hearts ; swords, answering to spades ; motzey, circles,
or pentacles, answering to clubs. F.ach suit consists of
fourteen cards, the ace, and nine others, and four court
cards : king, queen, knight, and knave. The four aces
form the keys of their respective suits.'' As already
indicated, the twenty-two " keys of the tarot," which
consist of various emblematic figures, are assumed to be
hieroglyphic symbols of the occult meanings of the letters
of the Hebrew alphabet; or, alternatively," the alphabet
of the Magi.'' ·' Immense antiquity is claimed for these
symbols," observes Ranking. " Alliette or (by trans-
position) Ettcilla, a French mystic of the beginning of the
nineteenth century, ascribed their origin to Hermes Trisme-
gistu3, under the name of The Book of Thoth. or The Golden
Book of Hermes. Others have sought to identify the tarot
with the sibylline leaves." Raymond Lully (1235-1315)
is said to have based his great work, Ars Gmeralis sive
Magna, on the application of the occult philosophy con-
tained in the taYot.
The idea that the tarot was introduced into Europe by the
Gypsies appears to have been first broached by Vaillant,
who had lived for many years among the Gypsies, by
whom he was instructed in their traditional lore. ::\!uch of
the information thus obtained is incorporated in Les
R6mes, histoire vraie des vrais Bohemietzs (c. 1853), La
Bible des Boltimiens (186<>), and La Clef Magique de Ia
Fiction et dz< Fait (1863). Vaillant's theory has been fully
accepted by a French writer. " Papus," who published in
1889 Le Tarot des Bollemiens: Le Plus Ancien Livre du
Monde ;describing it as" Ia clef absolue de Ia science occt4lte."
"The Gypsies possess a Bible," he asserts; " yes, this
card ga.me called the Tarot which the Gypsies possess is
the Bible of Bibles. It is a marvellous book, as Gount
de Gebelin and especially Vaillant have realized. Under
the names of Tarot, Thora, Rota, this game has formed
successively the basis of the synthetic teaching of all the
ancient peoples."
Althou~h it may not be possible to accept this dictum
in its entirety, it is of interest to note that Ranking con-
cludes that these and all other :playing-cards were intro-
duced into Europe by the Gyps1es. " I would submit,'
he says, writing in 1908, " that from internal evidence we
may deduce that the tarots were introduced by a race
speaking an Indian dialect ;- that the form of the Pope
(as portrayed in the tarots) shows they had been long in a
country where the orthodox Eastern Church predominated ;
and the form of head-dress of the king, together with the
shape of the eagle on the shield. shows that this was governed
by Russian Grand Dukes, who had not yet assumed the
Imperial insignia. This seems to me confirm:1tory of the
widespread belief that it is to the Gypsies we are indebted
for our knowledge of playing-cards." It will be seen that
this conclusion is based upon independent judgment.
A5; early, however, as x86s-two years after the appearance
of Vaillant's last book-E. S. Taylor supported the same
h)Tothesis in his History of Playing Cards. Willshire
(Descriptive Catalogues of Cards in the British Museum, 1877)
controverts Taylor's conclusion, on the ground that
"whether the Ziogari be of Egyptian or Indian origin,
they did not appear in Europe before 1417, when cards
had been known for some time.'' But this objection is
nullified by the fact that the presence of Gypsies, in Europe
is now placed at a date considerably anterior to x.p7.
There was, for example, a well-established feudum Acin-
ganorum, or Gypsy barony, in the island of Corfu in the
fourteenth century.
To examine in detail the various emblematic figures of the
tarot would demand a disproportionate amount of space.
Ranking's reference to the Pope and the King points to
two of these twenty-two figures. The others are : the
Female Pope, the Queen, Osiris Triumphant, The Wheel
of Fortune, Justice, Prudence, Temperance, Strength,
1-Iarriage, The Philosopher, The Juggler, Death, The Devil,
The Fool, The Lightning-struck Tower, The Sun, The
lVloon, The Star, The Universe, The Last Judgment. There
is great diversity of opinion, even among " initiates," as
to the meaning of these symbols. They are very fully
discussed in the work of •• Papus " already cited ; to
which the reader is specially referred. On the whole,
there is much to be said in favour of the theory that the
origin of the tarot ~ traceable to the ~otcric philosophy of
the schools of ancient Egypt and Chaldea, by whatever
means it has found its way mto Europe.

Tatwic Yoga: meaning "The Science of Breath." 'fhe
title of a little book translated from the Sanscrit some
years ago by the Pandit Rama Prasad. The " breath"
referred to is the life-giving breath of Brahman, and in it
are contained the five elementary principles of nature,
corresponding to the f1ve senses of man. These principles
are know as Tatwas, and of them the body is composed.
The knowledge of the Tatwas is believed to confer wonder-
ful power ; and to this end all undertakings must be com-
menced at times which arc known to be propitious from
the movements of the Tatwas in the body. An important
method o! yoga practice is given in the book, which will
certainly assure marvellous results.

These were intended to represent tears, and were a sign of
general mourning.
Teleklnesls : A term denoting the hypothetical faculty of
moving material objects by thought alone. The move-
ment of objects without contact-e frequent phenomenon
of the seance-room, including in its wider sense rappings,
table-tiltings, levitations, the conveyance of apports,
practically all material phenomena, with the possible
exception of materialisation-is exceeding difficult of
explanation on rational grounds, and the attempt to
explain it thus, without the intervention of discarnate
spirits, has given rise to the telekinetic theory, which holds
that all these varied feats are accomplished by the thoughts
of medium and sitters, independent of muscular energy,
whether direct or indirect. How thought can possibly
act in this immediate way on inanimate matter is beyond
comprehension in our present state of lmowledge. The
evidence for telekinesis is very much less th;m, say, that for
telepathy. The telekinetic theory is akin to that offered
by the magnetists, who regarded a fluidic or energetic
emanation as the cause of the movements.
Telepathy : Of the various branches of psychic phenomena
there is none which engages more serious attention at the
present day than telepathy or thought transference. The
idea of inter-communication between brain and brain, by
other means than that of the ordinary sense-channels, is a
theory deserving of the most careful consideration, not
only in its simple aspect as a claimant for recognition as an
important scientific fact, but also because there is practically
no department of psychic phenomena on which it has not
some bearing. To take one instance-a few decades ago
the so-called " rationalist" view of ghosts was simply
that supernatural phenomena did not exist, but now a
telepathic explanation is offered, more or less tentatively,
by an ever-increasing body of intelligent opinion. There
are those who, while admitting the genuineness of psychic
phenomena are yet satisfied that pure psychology provides
a field sufficiently wide for their researches, and who are
loath to extend its boundaries to include an unknown
spirit-world where research becomes a hundred-fold more
difficult. To such students the theory of telepathy affords
an obvious way of escape from that element of the super-
natural to which they are opposed, since it is generally
agreed that in seeking an explanation of thought trans-
ference it is a physical process which must be looked for.
In the words of Sir William Crookes : " It is known that
the action of thought is accompanied by certain molecular
movements in the brain, and here we have physical vibra-
tions capable from their extreme minuteness of acting direct
on individual molecules, while their rapidity approaches
that of the internal and external movements of the atoms
themselves."
There is therefore nothing to render the theory of thought-
vibrations impossible, or even improbable, though the
difficulty of proving it has yet to be overcome. We have,
however, to contend with the fact that in many cases on
record the most vivid impressions have been transmitted
from a distance, thus showin~ that the distinctness of the
impression docs not necessanly decrease in proportion as
the distance becomes greater. In this case we must either
conclude that there are other factors to be taken into
account, such as the varying intensity of the impression,
and the varying degress of sensitiveness in the percipient,
or we must conclude, as some authorities have done, that
telepathic communication goes direct from one mind to
another, irrespective of distance, just as thought can travel
to the oppostie side of the globe with as much ease as it can
pass to the next room. Other a~thorities claim that the
transmission of thought is on a different plane from any
Telepathy
physical process, though, as the action of thought itself
has a physical basis, it is difficult to understand why a
supernatural explanation should be thought necessary in
the case of telepathy. I11 the former connection it may be
remarked that trivial circumstances can be transmitted to
a percipient ncar at hand, while as a rule only the more
intense and violent impressions are received from a dis-
tance. The question whether the telepathic principle is
diffusive, and spreads equally in all directions, or whether
it can be projected directly toward one ~dividual, is still
a vexed one. If it be in the form of ethereal vibrations,
it would certainly seem easier to regard it as diffusive.
On the other hand, practical experience has shown that
in many instances, even when acting from a distance, it
affects only one or two individuals. However, this might
be explained naturally enough by the assumption that each
transmitter requires a special receiver-i.e., a mind in
sympathy ·with itself. But a~ yet no explanation is
forthcoming, and the most that can be done is to suspend
judgment for the present, knowing that only the possi-
bility, or, at most, the likelihood, of such a mode of com-
munication has been proved, and that of its machinery
nothing can be said beyond the vaguest surmise.
The theorr of thought transference is no new one. Like
gravitation, 1t is a daughter of the hoary scienceof astrology.
but while gravitation is a full-grown fact, universally
accepted ofscience, telepathy, in its scientific aspect, is as yet
an infant, and a weakling at that. However, it is not
difficult to understand how both should ~pring from
astrology, nor to trace the connection between them. The
wise men of ancient days supposed the stars to radiate an
invisible influence which held them togeth~r in their course,
and which affected men and events on our planet, receiving
in their tums some subtle emanation from the earth and its
inhabitants. From this idea it was but a step to assume
that a radiant influence, whether magnetic or otherwise,
passed from one human being to another. The doctrine
of astral influence was shared by Paracclsus and his alchem-
istic successors until the ep<'Ch of Sir Isaac Newton, whose
discovery of the law of gravitation brought the age of
astrology to a close. To the conception of magnetic
influence colour was lent by the practices of Mesmer, and
his followers, who ascribed to the •· magnetic fluid " the
phenomena of hypnosis. The analogy between the
mysterious and inexplicable force binding worlds together
and the subtle influence joining mind with mind is suffici-
ently obvious, but the difficulty is that while gravitation
may be readily demonstrated, and never fails to give
certain definite results, experiments in telepathy reveal
the phenomena only in the most spasmodic fashion and
cannot be depended upon to succeed even under the most
favourable conditions. Nevertheless such systemati7.ed
experiments as have been conducted from time to time
have more than justified the interest which has been dis-
played in telepathy. Science, wh'ch had so long held herself
aloof from hypnosis, was not desirous of repeating her error
in a new connection. In t 882 the Society for Psychical Re-
search (q.v.} came into being, numbering among its members
some of the most distinguished men in the country. It
had for its object the elucidation of the so-called "super-
natural" phenomena which were exciting so much popular
interest and curiosity ; and foremost among these was
the phenomenon of thought transference, or, as it has since
been christened, telepathy. Viewing their subject in a
purely scientific light, trained in the hanJling of evidence,
and resolved to pursue truth with open and unbiassed
minds, they did much to bring the study of psychic phenom-
ena into a purer and more dignified atmosphere. They
recognized the untrustworthiness of human nature in
general, and the prevalence of fraud even where no object
Telepathy 405 TempIars
was to be gained but the gratification of a perverted vanity,
and their experiments were conducted under the most rigid
conditions. with every precaution taken against conscious
or unconscious deception. Among the most valuable
evidence obtained from experimental thought transference
was that gleaned by Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick (q.v.)
fTom their experiments at Brighton in 1889-91. In this
series the percipients-clerks and shop assistants-were
hypnotized. Sometimes they were asked to visualize, on a
blank card, an image or picture chosen by the agent. At
other times the agent would choose one of a bu;1dle of
cards numbered from 10 to go, and the percipient was
required to state the number on the picked card, which
"-'as done correctly in a surprising number of cases. We
find, curiously enough, that the results varied in proportion
as the agent and percipient were near or far apart. and were
materially affected by the intervention of a door, or even a
curtain, between the two, but this was ascribed to a lack of
confidence on the part of the percipient, or to such physical
causes as fatigue or ennui, rather than to the limited scope
of the telepathic principle. On the whole we are justified
in thinking that chance alone would not account for the
number of correct replies given by the hypnotised subject.
Towards the end of the century a criticism was levelled
at these experiments by 1\llessrs. Hansen and Lehmann, of
Copenhagen. whose belief it was that the phenomenon
known as " subconscious whispering." together with
hyperresthesia on the part of the percipient, would suffice
to produce the results obtained by the Sidgwicks. This
suggested explanation, while it does not cover the entire
ground has some right to our consideration. If hypnotism
reveals so marvellous arefinement of the perceptions, may
not some elements of hypcr<esthesia linger in the sub-
consciousness of the normal individual ? If dreams contain
in the experience of almost everyone, such curious examples
of deduction, may not the mental under-current follow in
waking moments a process of reasoning of which the higher
consciousness knows nothing ? It may, and it does.
That •· other self," which is never quite so much in the
background as we imagine, sees and hears a thousand
things of which we are unconscious, and which come to the
surface in dreams, it may be long afterwards; and there is
no reason to suppose that it might not see and bear indica-
tions too slight to be perceived in a grosser sphere of
consciousness, and thus account for some cases of·· thought
transference." On the other hand, we have evidences of
telepathy acting at a distance where sub-conscious whisper-
ing and hyper<esthcsia are obviously out of the question.
Though hypcr<esthesia may be advanced as a plausible
explanation in some-or, mdeed. in many-instances of
telepathy, it cannot be accepted as a complete explanation
unless it covers all cases, and that it certainly does not.
So we must look elsewhere for the explanation, though it
is not without reluctance that we quit a theory so admir-
ably adapted to known conditions that it scarcely requires
a stretching of established physiological laws to make
telepathy fit as naturally as wireless telegraphy into the
scheme of things.
As bas been earlier mentioned, practically every branch
of psychic phenomena would be vitally affected by the
scientific proof of telepathy. Coincident dreams might, in
the majority of C<\ses, be easily explained away. The
visions of the crystal-gazer, the trance-utterances of the
medium, could be accounted for in the same manner, to-
gether with the occasional apparitions visiting the normal
individual. Apparitions of the dead. however, do not so
readily submit themselves to a telepathic explanation. If
they are genuine apparitions, and not meaningless hallu-
cinations. we must either admit that the impulse directing
the impression comes from the surviving spirit of the
deceased agent, or that it was transmitted while he was
yet alive. In the latter case we are confronted with a
difficulty-how to account for the time which may elapse
between the death of the agent and the appearance of the
vision. To bridge the gap thus formed Mr. Podmore (q.v.),
in his work on Telepathic Hallrtcinations, has produced his
theory of latent impressions, which successfully overcomes
the difficulty. According to Mr. Podmore, impressions
transmitted from one mind to another may remain latent
for a considerable time awaiting a favourable opportunity
fot development. Thus the apparition of one who
been dead for some time may result from an impression
transmitted during his lifetime, which the perciptent has
retained, until a chance combination of ideas brings it into
the upper stratum of consciousness in the form of a hallu-
cination. Obviously the theory of latent impressions ma"y
bear on other phenomena than that of apparitions, and
serve to fill in gaps which might otherwise remain blank.
It is interesting to compare the tone of criticisms pro-
nounced on telepathy in the last quarter of the nineteenth
century with that which characterises later utterances on
the subject. Science is no longer ashamed to pursue her
researches in psychic phenomena ; thought tr<~.nsference
no longer appears to intellectual people as a doubtful
by-path of psychology, and the change argues that at least
a fair attempt will be made to reach the truth of the
matter.

Templars : The Knights Templars of the Temple of Solomon
were a military order, founded by a Burgundian, Hugues
de Payns, and Godeffroi de St. Orner, a French Knight, in
1119, for the purpose of protecting pilgrims journeying into
the Holy Land. They were soon joined by other knights,
and a religious chivalry speedily gathered around this
nucleus. Baldwin I., King of Jerusalem, gave them as
headquarters a portion of his palace, contiguous to a
mosque which tradition asserted was part of the Temple
of Solomon, and from this building they took their designa-
tion. One of the purposes of the Society was to convert
and render useful knights of evil life, and so many of these
entered the order, as to bring it under the suspicaon of the
Church, but there is every reason to believe that its founders
were instigated by motives of the deepest piety, and that
they lived in a condition akin to poverty. notwithstanding
the numerous gifts that were showered upon them, is the
best proof of this. They had properly constituted officials,
a Grand Master. knights, chaplams, sergeants, craftsmen,
sensechals, marechals, and commanders. The order had
its own clergy exempt from the jurisdiction of diocesan
rule, and its chapters were held as a rule in secret. The
dress of the brotherhood was a white mantle with a red
cross for unmarried knights, and a black or brown mantle
with a red cross for the others. The discipline was of the
very strictest description and the food and clothiug stipu-
lated were rough and not abundant. By the middle of
the twelfth century, the new order had got a footing in
Templars 406
nearly all the Latin lcingdoms of Christendom. Its power
grew apace, and its organisation became widespread. It
formed, as it were, a nucleus of the Christian effort against
the paganism of the east, and its history may be said to be
that of the crusades. Moreover it became a great trading
corporation, the greatest commercial agency between the
east and west, and as such amassed immense wealth. On
the fall of the Latin kingdom in Palestine, the Templars
had perforce to withdraw from that country, and although
they continued to harass the Saracen power they made
but little headway against it, and in reality appear to have
undertaken commercial pursuits in preference to those of
a more warlike character. \'l'hen the Temple was at the
apogee of its power, its success aroused the envy and avarice
of Philip TV. of France, who commenced a series of attacks
upon it. The election of Pope Clement V., who was
devoted to his interests, and a denunciation of the order for
heresy and immorality gave Philip his chance. For
several generations before this t ime, strange stories had
been circulating concerning the secret rites of the Templars
which were assisted by the very strict privacy of these
meetings. which were usually held at day-break with
closely-guarded doors. It was alleged that the most
horrible blasphemies and indecencies took place at these
meetings, that the cross was trampled under foot and spat
upon. and that an idol named Baphomet (q.v.) (Baphe
metios, baptism of wisdom} was adored, or even the Devil
in the shape of a black cat. Other tales told of the roasting
of children, and the smearing of the idol with their burning
fat, and other nonsense was wildly promulgated by the
credulous and ignorant. A certain Esquian de Horian,
pretended to betray the "secret " of the Templars to
Philip, and they were denounced to the Inquisition ; and
Jacques de )folay, the Grand :\Iaster, who had been called
from Cyprus to France, was arrested with one hundred
and forty of his brethren in Paris and thrown into prison.
A universal arrest of the Templars throughout France
followed. The wretched lrnights were tortured en masse.
and as was usually the case, under such compulsion, con-
fessed to the most grotesque crimes, and the most damning
confession of all, was that of the Grand ~!aster himself, who
confessed that he had been guilty of denying Christ and
spitting upon the Cross, but repudiated all charges of
immorality in indignant terms.
The process dragged on slowly during more than three
years, in consequence of the jealousies which arose among
those who were more or less interested in its prosecution.
The pope wished to bring it entirely under the jurisdi-
ction
of the church, and to have it decided at Rome. The king,
on the other hand, mistrusting the pope, and resolved on
the destruction of the order, and that none but himself
should reap advantage of it, decided that it should be
judged at Paris under his own personal influence. The
prosecution was directed by his ministers, Nogaret, and
Enguerrand de Marigny. The Templars asserted their
innocence, and demanded a fair trial ; but they found few
advocates who would undertake their defence, and they
were subjected to hardships and tortures which forced
many of them into confessions dictated to them by their
persecutors. During this interval, the pope's orders were
carried into other countries, ordering the arrest of the
Templars, and the seizure of their ~oods, and everywhere the
same charges were brought aga1ust them, and the same
means adopted to procure their condemnation, although
they were not everywhere subjected to the same severity
as in France. At length, in the sprin$" of 1316, the grand
process was opened in Paris, and an IDlmense number of
Templars, brought from all parts of the kingdom, under-
went a public examination. A long act of accusation was
read, some of the heads of which were, that the Templars,
TempJars
at their reception into the order, denied Christ (and some-
times they denied expressly all the saints) declaring that be
was not God truly, but a false prophet, a man who had
been punished for his crimes ; that they had no hope of
salvation through him ; that they always, at their initiation
into the order, spit upon the cross. and trod it under foot ;
that they did this especially on Good Friday; that they
worshipped a certain cat, which sometimes appeared to
them in their congregation ; that they did not believe in any
of the sacraments of the church ; that they took secret
oaths which they were bound not to reveal ; that the
brother who officiated at the reception of a new brother
kissed the naked body of the latter, often in a very unbe-
coming manner ; that each different province of the order
had its idol, which was a head, having sometimes three
faces. and at others only one; or sometimes a human skull;
these idols they worshipped in their chapters and congre-
gations. believing that they had the power of making them
rich, and of causing the trees to flourish, and the earth to
become fruitful; that they girt themselves with cords. with
which these idols had been superstitiously touched ; that
those who betrayed the secrets of their order, or were
disobedient. were thrown into prison, and often put to
death : that they held their chapters secretly and by night,
and placed a watch to prevent them from any danger of
interruption or discovery ; and that they believed the
Grand Master alone had the power of absolving them from
their sins. The publication of these charges, and the
agitation which had been designedly got up, created such
a horror throughout France, that the Tetnplars who died
during the process were treated as condemned heretics, and
burial in consecrated ground w01s refused to their remains.
\Vhen we read over the numerous examinations of the
Templars, in other countries, as well as in France, we
cannot but feel convinced that some of these charges had
a degree of foundation, though perhaps the circumstances
on which they were founded were misunderstood. A very
great number of knights agreed to the general points of
the formula of initiation, and we cannot but believe that
they did deny Christ, and that they spat and trod upon
the cross. The words of the denial were, Je reney Deu
or Je reney j hesu, repeated thrice; but most of those who
confessed having gone through this ceremony, declared
that they did it with repugnance. and that they spat
beside the cross, and not on it. The reception took place
in a secret room, with closed doors ; the candidate was
compelled to take off part or all of his garments (very
rarely the 1:\tter). and then he was kissed on various parts
of the body. One of the knights ex-amined, Guischard
de 1\farzici, said he remembered the reception of Hugh
de Marhaud, of the diocese of Lyons, whom he saw taken
into a small room, which was closed up so that no one
could sec or hear what took place within; but that when,
after some time, he was let out, he was very pale, and looked
as though he were troubled and amazed (fuit valde pallidus
et quasi lurbatus ct stupefactu.~.) In conjunction, however,
with these strange and revolting ceremonies, there were
others that showed a reverence for the Christian church and
its ordinances, a profound faith in Christ, and the con-
sciousness that the partaker of them was entering into a
holy vow.
M. Michelet, who has carefully investigated the materials
relating to the trial of the Templars, has suggested at
least an ingenious explanation of these anomalies. He
imagines that the form of reception was borrowed from
the figurative mysteries and rites of the early church. The
candidate for admission into the order, according to this
notion, was first presented as a sinner and renegade, in
which character, after the example of St. Peter, he denied
Christ. This denial was a sort of pantomime, in which the
Templars 407
novice express~ his reprobate state by spitting on the
cross. The candidate was then shipped of his profane
clothing. received through the kiss of the order into a higher
state of faith, and re-dressed with the garb of its holiness.
Forms like these would, in the middle ages, be easily
misunderstood, and their original meaning soon forgotten.
Another charge in the accusation of the Templars seems
to have been to a great degree proved by the depositions
of witnesses; the idol or head which they were said to have
worshipped, but the real character or meaning of which
we arc totally unable to explain. Many Templars con-
fessed to having seen this idol, but as they described
it di.fferently, we must suppose that it was not in all cases
represented under the same form. Some said it was a
frightful bead, with long beard and sparkling eyes ; others
said it was a man's skull; some described it as having
three faces ; some said it was of wood, and others of x::.otal ;
one witness described it as a painting (tab~tla picta) repre-
senting the image of a man, (imago hominis). and said that
when it was shown to him, he was ordered to·' adore Christ
his creator." According to some it was a gilt figure, either
of wood or metal ; while others described it as painted
black and white. According to another deposition, the
idol had four feet-two before and two behind ; the one
belonging to the order at Paris was said to be a silver head;
with two faces and a beard. The novices of the order were
told always to regard this idol as their saviour. Dcodatus
Jaffet, a knight from the south of France, who had been
received at Pedenat, deposed that the person who in his
case performed the ceremonies of reception, showed him a
head or idol, which appeared to have three faces, and
said, " You must adore this as your saviour, and the
saviour of the order of the Temple," and that he was made
to worship the idol, saying, " Blessed be he who shall save
my soul." Ccttus Ragonis, a knight received at Rome in
a chamber of the palace of the Lateran, gave a somewhat
similar account. Many other witnesses spoke of having
seen these heads, which, however, were, perhaps, not
shown to everybody, for the greatest number of those who
spoke on this subject, said that they had heard speak of the
head, but that they had never seen it themselves ; and
many of them declared their disbelief in its existence. A
friar minor deposed in England that an English Templar
had assured him that in that country the order had four
principal idols, one at London in the sacristy of the Temple.
another at Bristelham, a third at Brueria (Bruem in
Lincolnshire), and a fourth beyond the Humber.
Some of the knights from the south added another
circumstance in their confessions relating to this head.
A Templar of Florence declared that, in the secret meetings
of the chapters, one brother said to the others, showing them
the idol, ·• Adore this head. This head is. your G<>d, and
your Mahomet." Another, Gauserand de Montpesant ,
said that the idol was made in the figure of Baffomet (in
figuram Baffometi) ; and another Raymond Rubei, described
it as a wooden head, on which was painted the figure of
Baphomet, and he adds, " that he worshipped it by kissing
its feet, and exclaiming, Y alla," which he describes as " a
word .of the Saracens " (verbH11l Saracenorum). This has
been seized upon by some as a proof that the Templars had
secretly embraced Mahometanism. As Baflomet or Bapho-
met is evidently a corruption of Mahomet ; but it must not
be forgotten that the Christians of the West constantly
used the word Mahomet in the mere signification of an
idol, and that it was the desire of those who conducted the
prosecution against the Templars to show their intimate
intercourse with the Saracens. Others, especially Von
Hammer, gave a Greek derivation of the word, and assumed
it as a proof that Gnosticism was the secret doctrine of the
Temple.
TempIars
The confessions with regard to the mysterious cat were
much rarer and more vague. Some Italian knights con-
fessed that they had been present at a secret chapter of
twelve knights held at BrindiSi, at which a grey cat suddenly
appeared amongst them, and that they worshipped it.
At Nismes, some Temp!ars declared that they had been
present at a chapter at Montpellier, at wb.ich the demon
appeared to them in the form of a cat, and promised them
worldly prosperity ; and added, that they saw devils in
the shape of women. Gilletl\s de Encreyo, a Templar of
the diocese of Rheims, who disbelieved in the story of the
cat, deposed that he had heard say, though he kne,,· not
by whom, that in some of their battles beyond sea, a cat
had appeared to them. An English knight, who was
examined at London, deposed, that in England they did
not adore the cat or the idol to his knowledge, but he had
heard it positively stated that they worshipped the cat
and the idol in parts beyond sea.. English witnesses
deposed to other acts of "idolatry." It was of course
the demon, who presented himself in the form of the cat.
A lady, named Agnes Lovecote, examined in England,
stated that she had heard that, at a chapter held in Dines-
lee (Dynnesley, iu IIertfordshire), the devil appeared to the
Templars in a monstrous form, having precious stones
instead of eyes, which shone so bright that they illuminated
the whole chapter ; the brethren, in succession, kissed
him on the posteriors, and marked there the form of the
cro3s. Slie was told that one young man, who refused
to go through this ceremony, was thrown into a well. and
a great stone cast upon him. Another witness, Robert
de Folde, said that he had heard twenty years ago, that
in the same place, the devil came to the chapter once a
year, and flew away with one of the knights, whom he took
as a sort of tribute. Two others deposed that certain
Templars confa~>sed to them that at a grand annual assembly
in the county vi York, the Templars worshipped a calf.
All this is mere hearsay. but it shows the popular opinion
of the conduct of the order. A Templar examined in
Paris, named Jacques de Treccs, who said that he bad been
informed that at secret chapters held at midnight, a head
appeared to the assembled brethren, added, that one of
them ·• had a private demon, by whose council he was
wise and rich."
The aim of King Philippe was secured ; he seized upon
the whole treasure of the temple in France, and became
rich. Those who ventured to speak in defence of the
order were browbeaten, and received little attention ;
the torture was employed to force confessions ; .fifty-four
Templars who refused to confess were carried to the wind-
mill of St. Antoine, in the suburbs of Paris, and there
bornt ; and many others, among whom was the Grand
Master himself, were subsequently brought to the stake.
After having last~d two or three years, the process ended
in the condemnation and suppression of the order, and its
estates were given in some countries to the knights of
St. John. It was in France that the persecution was most
cruel ; in England, the order was suppressed, but no
executions took place. Eve~ in Italy, the severity of the
judges was not everywhere the same ; in Lombardy and
Tu~cany, the TemplaYs were condemned, while they were
acquitted at Ravenna and Bologna. They were also
pronounced innocent in Castile, wi;rile in Arragon they
were reduced by force, only because they had attempted to
resist by force of arms ; and both in Spain and in Portugal
they only gave up their own order to be admitted into
others. The pope was offended at the lenity shown towards
them in England, Spain, and Germany. The ordel" of the
temple was finally dissolved and abolished, and its memory
branded with disgrace. Some of the knights are said to
have remaincJ together, and formed secret societies. The
Templars 408 Tetragram
result, in effect, was the same everywhere. Convicted
of heresy, sorcery, and many other abominations, the
wretched Templat-s were everywhere punished with death
by lire, imprisonment, and their goods escheated to the
various crowned heads of Europe, nearly all of whom
followed the avaricious example of Philip of France.
Jacques de Molay. the Grand Master, brought out on to a
scaffold erected in front of Notre Dame in Paris, and asked
to repeat his confession and receive sentence of perpetual
impnsonment, flared into sudden anger, recanted all
he·had said. and protested his innocence. He was burnt,
and summoned the Pope and the King with his dying
breath, to meet him before the bar of Heaven. Both of
these dignatories shortly afterwards died, and it remained
in the public mind that the outcome of the Grand Master's
summons had proved his innocence.
As bas been said, there is every reason to believe that
there was some foundation for the charges of heresy made
against the Templars. Their intimate connection with
the East, and the long establishment of the order therein
had in all probability rendered their Christianity not
quite so pure as that of Western Europe. Numerous
treatises have been Ytritten for the purpose of proving and
disproving the Temple heresy, to show that it followed the
doctrines and rites of the Gnostic Ophites of Islam
(Baphomet being merely a corruption of Mahomet), and it
has been collated with various other eastern systems.
Hans Prutz, in his Geheimlehre furthered the view of the
rejection of Christianity in favour of a religion based
on Gnostic dualism, and at once raised up a host of critics.
But many defenders of the order followed, and it was
proved in numerous instances the confessions wrung from
the Templat-s were the result of extreme torture. In not
a few eases were they acquitted, as in Castile, Aragon,
Portugal, and at many German and !Q.lian centres. It
has also been shown that tbe answers of a number of the
knights under torture were practically dictated to them.
In England, out of eighty Templars examined, only four
confessed to the charge of heresy, and of these two were
apostates. The whole question may perhaps be summed
up as follows. The Templat-s, through long association
with the East, may have become more tolerant of pagan-
ism, more broadrninded, in their outlook, than their
bigoted stay-at-home countrymen. Expressions as regards
the worthiness of Saracen nations, among whom the
Templars had many friends, would be regarded askance in
France, SpaiD and England, and habits acquired by
residence in the East would probably add to the growing
body of suspicion regarding the loyalty of the order to
Christianity. It it even possible that the Templars intro-
duced into their rites practices which savoured of Gnosti-
cism or Mahomedanism, but that is unlikely. They were,
in short, the victims of their own arrogance, their com-
mercial success, and the superstitious ignorance of their
eontemporaries.
It has frequently been asserted that on the death of
jacques de Mclay a conspiracy was entered into by the
surviving Templars which had for its objects the destruction
of papacy ancl the several kingdoms of Europe, and that
this tradition was handed on through generations of
initiates through such societies as the Illuminati and the
Freemasons, who in the end brought about the French
Revolution and the downfall of the French throne. Such
a theory, however enticing to the pseudo-occultist, the
defender of the theory that occult tradition has descended
to us through a direct line of adepts, or the fictioneer, can
receive no countenance here, and must be dismissed as a
mere figment of enthusiasm or imagination.
Temple Church. London : Hargrave Jennings ill his Rosi-
C1'ucians, their Rites and Mysteries, says : The Temple
Church, Lot~don, presents many mythic figures, which
have a Rosicrucian expression. In the spandrels of the
arches of the long church, besides the " Beauseant ·•
which is repeated in many places, there are the armorial
figures following; " Argent, on a cross gules, the Agnus
Dei, or Paschal Lamb, or, " Gules the Agnus Dei, dis-
playing over the right shoulder the standard of the Temple ;
or, a banner, triple cloven, bearing a cross gules; " Azure,

argent. horns. upwards, on either side of the cross, a star
or." This latter figure signifies the Virgin Mary, and
displays the cross as rising like the pole, or mast of a shi.P

or... The staff of the Grand Master of the Templars
displayed a curved cross of four splays, or blades, red upon
white. The eight-pointed red Buddhist cross was also one
of the Tcmplar ensigns. The Temple arches abound with
brandished estoiles, or stars, with wavy or crooked flames.
The altar at the east end of the Temple Church has a cross
£Iourie, with lower limb prolonged, or, on a field of estoiles,
wavy ; to the right is the Decalogue, surmounted by the
initials, A.O. (Alpha and Omega), on the left are the
monograms of the Saviour, I. C., X. C.; beneath, is the
Lord's Prayer. The whole altar displays .feminine colours
and emblems, the Temple CJmYth being dedicated to the
Virgin Maria. The winged horse, or Pegasus, argent, in a
field gules, is the badge of the Templars. The tombs of
the Templars, disposed around the circular church in
Loudon, are of that early Norman shape called dos d'ane ;
their tops are triangular ; the ridge-moulding passes
through the temples and out of the mouth of a mask at
the upper end, and issues out of the horned skull, apparently
of some purposely trodden creature. The bead at the top
is shown in the " honour-point " of the cover of the tomb.
There is an amount of unsuspected meaning in every
curve of these Templar tombs.
Tempon-teloris-Shlp of the Dead : Among the Dayaks of
Borneo the Ship of the Dead, the vessel which carries the
souls of the departed in search of the hereafter, is generally
represented as being of the shape of a bird, the rhinoceros-

the fire-sea are aU the stores which have been laid out at
the trivah or feast of the dead, and all the slaves who have
been killed for that purpose. After some vicissitudes in
the fiery sea, the Ship ofthe Dead, with Tempon-telon at the
helm, reaches the goldet;t shores of the Blessed.

Teutons 409
Teutons : The Teutonic or " Germanic " nations, embracing
the peoples of High and Low German speech, Dutch,
Danes, and Scandinavians, have always displayed and still
display a marked leaning towards the study and con-
sideration of the occult. We are, however, concerned
here with their attitude towards the hidden sciences in
more ancient times, and must refer the reader to the
article on " Germany " and the other countries alluded
to for information upon medi<eval and modern occultism
in them.
B\tt little can ~ gleaned from the writings of dasskal
authors upon the subject, and it is not until we approach
the middle ages, the contemporary manuscripts concerning
the traditions of an earlier day, and the works of usch
writers as Snorre Sturluson and S:emund (The Eddas)
Saxo·Gr;ammaticus, and such epics or pseudo-histories as
The Nibelungenlied that we find any light thrown upon the
dark places of Teutonic magical practice and belief. From
the consideration of such authorities we arrive at several
basic conclusions: {I) That magic with the Ter4tons was
non-hierophantic, ami was not in any respect the province
of the priesthood, as with the Celtic Druids ; (2) That
women were its chief conesrvators ; (3) That it principally
resided in the study and elucidation of the runic script, in
the same manner as in early Egypt it was part and parcel
of the ability to decipher the hieroglyphic characters.
Passing from the first conclusion, which is self-evident,
as we discover all sorts and conditions of people dabbling
in magical practice, we find that to a great extent sorcery-
for efforts seem to have been confined mostly to black
magic-was principally the province of women. This is
to be explained, perhaps, by the circumstance that only
those who could read the runes-that is, those who could
read at all-were able to undertake the study of the occult,
and that therefore the unlettered warrior, too restless for
the repose of study, was barred from all advance in the
subject. We find women in all ranks of life addicted to
the practice of sorcery, from the queen on the throne to
the wise-woman or v.itch dwelling apart from the com-
munity. Thus the mother-in-law of Siegfried ~witches
him by a draught, and scores of similar instances could be
adduced. At the same time the general type of ancient
Teutonic magic is not vtry high, it is greatly hampered
by human considerations, and is much at the mercy of the
human element on which it acts, and the very human
des.irei which call it forth. Indeed in many cases it is
rendered nugatory by the mere cunning of the object
upon waich it is wreaked. In fine it does not rise very
much above the type of sorcery in vogue among barbarian
peoples at the present day. It is surprising, however,
with all these weaknesses, how {>Owerful a hold it con-
trived to get upon the popular Imagination, which was
literally drenched with the belief in supernatural science.
Rtmes.-(German, rune ; Anglo-Saxon ~utJ ; Icelandic
run). The word is derived from an old Low German
word Yatmen " to cut" or "to carve," and as the runes
in more ancient times were invariably carved and not
written, it latterly came to designate the characters them-
selves. As has been said, comparatively few were able
to decipher them, and the elucidation was left to the
curious, the ambitious among the female sex, and the
leisured few in general, those perhaps including priests
and lawmen. Consequently we find the power to decipher
them an object of mysterious veneration among the ignorant
and a ~lief that the ability to elucidate them meant the
possession of magieal powers. The possessors of this
ability would in no wise minimise it, so that the ~lief in
their prowess would flourish. Again, it is clear that a
certain amount of patience and natural ability were
necessary to the acquirement of such an intricate script.
Teutons
The tradition that they were connected with sorcery has
scarcely yet died out in some parts of Iceland. In later
times the word runes came to be applied to all the alpha-
betical systems employed by the Teutonic peoples ~fore
the introduction of Christianity. Their origin is obscure,
some authorities denying that it is Teutonic, and asserting
that they are merely a transformation or adaptation of
the Greek characters, and others that they have a Phomi-
cian or even cuneiform ancestry. That they are of non-
Teutonic origin is highly probable, as may ~ inferred
frc:n their strong resemblance to other scripts and from
the circumstance that it is highly unlikely that they could
have been separately evolved by the Teutonic race in the
state of comparative barbarism in which it was when they
first came into general use. They have been divided into
three systems-English, German, and Scandinavian-
but the difference ~tween these is merely local. They
were not employed in early times for literary purposes, but
for inscriptions only, which are usually found on stone
monuments. weapons, implements, and personal ornaments
and furniture. In England runic inscriptions are found in
the north only, where Scandinavian infiuencewas strongest.
The first symbols of the runic alphabet have the powers of
the letters f, u, th, 6, r, c, for which reason the order of the
runic letters is called not an alphabet but a fuJhon. The
system is symbolic. Thus its first quantity or letter
pictures the head and horns of an ox, and is called feol~
after that animal, the second is called ur, after the word
for " bull," the third thoru, a tree, the others following os,
a door; Yad, a saddle,; caen, a torch, all because of some
fancied resemblance to the objects, or, more properly
speaking, because they were probably derived or evolved
from a purely pictorial system in which the pictures of the
animals or objects enumerated above stood for the letters
of the alphabet. Since these were cut, some connection
may be permitted between Anglo-Saxon secgan, to say, and
Latin secare, to cut, especially when we find secret signa-
tures made of old by merely cutting a chip from the bark
manuscript. In spelling, for example, the old sense of
" spell" was a thin chip or shaving. Tacitus mentions
that in Teutonic divination a rod cut from a fruit-bearing
tree was cut into slips, and the slips, having marks on them,
were thrown confusedly on a white garment to be taken
up with prayer to the gods and interpreted as they were
taken. A special use of light cuttings for such fateful
cross-readings or "Virgilian lots," may have given to
" spells " their particular association with the words of
the magician.
Belief in NatuYe Spirits.-The scope of this work is
entirely without the consideration of mythology proper,
that is to say that the greater deities of the ma~y human
religious systems receive no treatment save m several
special circumstances. But the lesser fi~ures of mytholo&Y•
those who enter into direct contact w1th man and ass1st
him, or are connected with him, in magical practice, receive
special and separate notice. Thus the duergar<, or dwarfs
trolls, undines, nixies, and all the countless host of :reu·
tonic folk-lore are alluded to under their separate headings,
and we have here only to. consid~r their general.conn~tion
with Teutonic man m hiS mag1cal aspect. H1s behef In
them was distinctly of an animistic character. The dwarfs
and trolls inhabited the recesses of the moun~ins, caves,
and the underworld. The nixies and undines dwelt in the
lakes, riverS, pools, and inlets of the sea. In general these
were friendly to man, but objected to more than an
occasional intercourSe with him. Though not of the class
of supernatural being who obey the behests of man in
answer to magical summonses, these, especially the dWOl.rfs,
often acted as his instructors in art-magic, and many
instances of this are to ~ met with in tales and romances
Teutons 410 Theosophy
of early Teutonic origin. The dwarfs were usually assisted
by adve~titious aids in their practice of magic, such as
belts which endowed the wearer with strength, like that
worn by King Laurin, shoes of swiftness, analogous to the
seven-league boots of folk-tale, caps of inv-isibility, and so
forth.
Witchcraft.-\Vitchcraft, with its accompaniment of
diabolism was much more in favour among the northern
Teutons t~an it was in Germany, and this circumstance has
been attributed to their proximity to the Finns (~.v.), a
race notorious for its magical propensities. In Norway,
Ori.:ney, and Shetland. we find the practice of sorcery
almost exclusively in the hands of women of Fin-nish race,
and there is little doubt that the Finns exercised upon the
Te11tons of ~candinavia the mythic infl.uence of a conquered
ra~. t~at 1s, _they took fuil advantage of the terror in-
sprred m thetr conquerors by an alien and unfamiliar
religion a~d ritual, ~hich partook largely of the magical.
The pnnc1pal machmerv of Teutonic witchcraft was the
raising of storms, the sel'ting of pieces of knotted rope, each
~no~ r~p.r~~nting a wind, di'?nation and prophecy, acquir-
Ing mvJs1b1lity, and such mag1cal practices as usually accom-
pany a condition of semi-barbarism. In the North of
Scotland the Teutonic and Celtic magical systems mav be
said to have met and fused, but not to have clashed as
their many points of resemblance outweighed their differ-
~nces. ~s the sea. was the clement of the people, we find
1t the ch1ef element of the witch of the northern Teutons.
T~us we discover in the saga of Frithjoj, the two sea·
w1tc~es II~yde and Ham riding the storm and sent by
Hcl~t to ra1se a tempest which would drown Frithjof, and
taking ~he shape of a bear and a storm·eagle. In the saga
<>f Gretttr the Strong we find a witch-wife, Thurid, sending
adrift a magic log which should come to Grettir's island,
.a_nd which should lead to his undoing. Animal transforma-
tl?n plays a considerable part in Teutonic magic and
Witchcraft. In early Germany the witch (hexe) seems to
have been also a vampire.
. Seco11d Sigltt -It was, however, in prophecy and divina-
tton that the Teulot~s excelled, and this was more rife
among the more northern branches of the people than the
southern. Prophetic utterance was usually induced by
ecstasy. But it was not the professional diviner alone who
was capable of supernatural vision. Anvone under stress
of excitement, and particularly if near death, might
become •· fey," that is prophetic, and great attention
was invariably paid to utterances made whilst in this
coudition.

by this means that Moses performed so many marvels ;
that Joshua was able to stop the sun ; that Elias caused
fire to fall from heaven, and raised the dead; that Daniel
dosed the mouths of the lions ; and that the three youths

perform any of the wonders done by their fathers.
Theosophical Society was founded in 1875 by Helena Petrovna
Blavatsky and Henry Steele Olcott. They met in America
in 1874 where Colonel Olcott was engaged in spiritualistic
investigation at the house of the Eddy Brothers in Vermont.
Madame Blavatsky was, of course, deeply read in every
thing pertaining to the occult and similarity of tastes very-
naturally drew them together. Scientific materialism was
then engaging general attention and making no little
progress, and since theosophy is the antithesis of material-
ism of any kind, it was decided that some society should be
formed to combat this movement. In :\lay, 1875. a Miracle
Club was formed, but it was a failure. Later in the same
year, in the month of September, a fresh attempt was how-
ever, agreed on and this was made in ::s'ovember with Col.
Olcott as president, and :\fadame Blava.tsky as correspond-
ing secretary, and a membership of twenty. This attempt
seemed also to be doomed to failure, many members
dropping off because no phenomena were manifested and
indeed only Col. Olcott and Madame Blavatsky remained
with two of the founders of the society and a few
other members. Not discouraged by this, however, they
decided to amalgamate with the Indian Society, but even
this met with no more success, and it was not till by a happy
inspiration the society was removed to India, that it began
to attract attention and make headway. From that time
its success was assured and, whatever opinions may be
held of the soundness of theosophical teaching, no doubt
can be entertained of the extent and influence of the
society, which has numerous members in lands so far apart
and so different in spirit as America and India, besides every
other civilised country in the world. In accordance with
the spirit of theosophy, no dogma is demanded of members
save acceptance of the belief in the brotherhood of man, so
that Christian and :Mohammedan may meet on equal terms
without any necessity of varying their peculiar religious
beliefs. Its activities include study of everything germane
to theosophy, religion, philosophy, laws of nature whether
patent to all mankind as in the domain of science, or hidden
as yet from all but those with special knowledge, as in tbe
domain of the occult. (See Theosophy.)
Theosophical Society of Agrippa: Agrippa (q.v.) established
in Paris and other centres a secret theosophical society, the
rites of admission to which were of a peculiar character.
The fraternity also possessed signs of recognition. Agrippa
visited London in 1510, and whilst there he established a
branch of the order in that city. A letter of Landulph's
is extant in which he introduces to Agrippa a native of
N'uremberg resident at Lyons, and whom he hopes .. may
be found worthy to become one of the brotherhood."
Theosophy : From the Creek theos, god, and sophia, wisdom ;
a philosophical-religious system which claims absolute
knowledge of the existence and nature of the deity, and
is not to be confounded with the later llystem evolved by
the founders of the Theosophical Society. This knowledge,
it is claimed, may be obtained by special individual revela-
tion, or through the operation of some higher faculty. It is
the transcendent character of the godhead of theosophical
systems which differentiates them from the philosophical
systems of the speculative or absolute type, which usually
proceed deductively from the idea of God. Cod is con-
ceived in theosophical systems as the tra.nscendant source
of being, from whom man in his natural state is far removed.
Theosophy is practically another name for speculative
mysticism. Thus the Kabalistic and Neoplatonic con-
ceptions of the divine emanations are in realitytheosophical,
as arc the mystical systems of Boehme and Baader.
Theosophy has also come to. signify the. tenets .and
teachings of the founders of t he Theosophtca.l Soc1ety.
This ·Society was founded in the United States in 1875
by ;\ladame H. P. Blavatsky (q.v.), Col. H. S. Olcott (q.v.)
Theosophy 411
and others. Its objects were to establish a nucleus of the
Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, to promote the
study of comparative religion and philosophy and to
investigate the mystic powers of life and matter. The
conception of the Universal Drotherbood was based upon
the oriental idea of One Life-that ultimate oneness
which underlies all diversity, whether inward or outward.
The study of comparative religion was materialised into
a definite system of belief, the bounds of which were
dogmatically fixed. It is set forth in the Theosophlcal
system that all the great religions of the world originated
from one supreme source and that they are merely expres-
sions of a central " V>'isdom Religion " vouchsafed to
various races of the earth in such a manner as was best
suited to hme and geographical circumstances. Underlying
these was a secret doctrine or esoteric teaching which
it was stated, had been the possession for ages of certain
JYfallatmas, or adepts in mysticism and occultism. With
these Madame Blavatsky claimed to be in direct communi-
~ation, and she herself mani!esteu occult phenomena,
producing the ringing of al.1:ml bells, and so forth.. On
several occasions these efforts were unmasked as fraudu·
lent, but that is no jusl ification for believing that Madame
Blavatsky was entirely a person of deceitful character.
There can be very little doubt that she was one of those
rare personalities who possess great natural psychic powers,
which at times failing her, she was driven in self-protection
to adopt fraudulent methods. The evidence for the
existence of the '' Great White Brotherhood " of Mahat-
mas, the existence of which she asserted, is unfortunately
somewhat feeble. It rests, for the most part, on the
statements of Madame Blavatsky, Col. Olcott, J.l.1r. Sinnet,
11r. Leadbeater, and others, who claimed to have seen or
communicated with them. \Vith every desire to do
justice to these upholders of the Theosophical argument,
it is necessary to point out that it bas been amply proved
that in occult, or pseudo-occult experiences, the question
of self-hallucination enters very largely (See Witchcrt.ft),
and the ecstatic condition may be answerable for subjective
appearances which seem real enough to the visionary.
Again the written communications of the Mahatmas give
rise to some doubt. It is pointed out for instance that
one of them employed the American system of spelling,
and this was accounted for by the circumstance that his
English had been sophisticated by reading American books.
The revelations of Madame Blavatsky were in reality no
more than a m~la11ge of Buddhistic, Brahministic and
Kabalistic matter ; but the Theosophical Society has
numbered within its members several persons of very high
ability, whose statement and exegesis of their faith has
placed it upon a much higher level and more definite
foundation. 1£ the system is intensely dogmatic, it is
also constructed in a manner akin to genius, and evolved on
most highly intricate lines. This system was to a great
extent pieced together after the death of the original
founder of the society, on which event a schism occurred
in the Brotherhood through the claims to leadership of
William Q. Judge, o£ New York, who died in r896, and
who was followed by Mrs. Katherine Tingley, the founder of
the great theosophical community at Point Lorna, Califor-
nia. Col. Olcott became the leader of the remaining part
of the original Theosophical Society in America and India,
being assisted in his work by Mrs. Annie Besant, but~ more
or less independent organisation was founded in England.
A brief outline of the tenets of Tlleosoplly may be
attempted. It posits absolute belief in its vie·ws instead
of blind faith. It professes to be the religion which holds
the ~erms of all others. It has also its aspect as a science-
a sc1ence of life and of the soul. The facts which it was
to lay before humanity are as follow:-" There are three
Theosophy
truths which are absolute, and which cannot be lost, but
yc~ may remain ~ilent for lack of speech. The soul of man
1s 1mmortal and tts future is the future of the thing, whose
~owt~ and splendour has no limit. The principle which
gtves hfe dwells in us and without us, is undying and eter-
nally beneficent, is not heard, or seen, or smelt, but is
perceived by the man who desires perception. Each man is
his own absolute law-giver, the dtspenser of glory or gloom
to himself, decreer of his life, his reward, his punishment."
. Although Theosophy posits the existence of an Absolute,
ti does not pretend to knowledge of its attributes. In
the Absolute arc innumerable universes, and in each universe
countless solar systems. Each solar system is the ex-
pression of a being called the Logos, the Word of God, or
Solar Deity, who permeates it and exists above it and
outside it. Below this Solar Deity are his seven ministers,
called Planetary Spirits, whose relation to him is like that
of the nerve centres to the brain, so that all his voluntary
acts come through him to them. (See Kabala.) Under
them are vast hosts or orders of spiritual beings called
devas, or angels, who assist in many ways. This world
is ruled by a great official who represents the Solar Deity,
which is in absolute control of all the evolution that takes
place upon this planet. When a new religion is to be
founded, this being either comes himself or sends one of his
pupils to institute it. In the earlier stages of the develop-
ment of humanity, the great officials of the hierarchy are
provided from more highly evolved parts of the system.
but whenever men can be trained to the necessary level of
power and wisdom these offices are held by them. They
can only be filled by adepts, who in goodness, power and
wisdom are immeasurably greater than ordinary men, and
have attained the summit of human evolution. These
advance until they themselves become of the nature of
deities. There arc many degrees and many lines of activity
among these, but some of them always remain within
touch of the earth and assist in the spiritual evolution of
humanity. This body it is which is called the " Great
\'Vhite Brotherhood." Its members do not dwell together,
but live separately apart from the world and are in con-
stant communication with one another and with their
head. Their knowledge of higher forces is so great that
they have no necessity !or meeting in the physical \vorld,
but each dwells in his own country, and their power remains
unsuspected among those who live near them. These
adepts arc ,~;mng to take as apprentices those who have
resolved to devote themselves utterly to the service of
mankind, and anyone who will may attract their attention
by showing himself worthy of their notice. Such an
apprentice was Madame Blavatsky. One of these masters
has said : " In order to succeed the pupil must leave his own
world and come into ours."
The formation of a solar system and the cosmogonic
operation of the theosophical conception bas been treated
in several separate articles; as have the various planes on
which the personality of a man dwells in its long journey
from earth to the final goal of Nirvana. The theosophical
conception of the constitution of man is that he is in
essence a spark of lhc divine fire belonging to the Monadic
world (q.v.). For the purposes of human evolution this
monad manifests itself in lower worlds. Entering the
Spiritual World it manifests itself tltere as the triple spirit
having its three aspects, one o£ which always remains in
the Spiritual Sphere. The second aspect manifests itself
in the Intuitional World ; and the third in the Higher
Mental World ; and these two are collated with intuition
and intelligence. These three aspects combined make up
the ego which is man during the human stage of evolution.
The way or path towards enlightenment and emancipation
is lmown as kam1a. The human personality is composed
Theosophy 412 Thomas the Rhymer
of a complex organisation consisting of seven principles
which are united and interdependent, yet divided into
certain groups, each capable of maintaining a kind of
personality. Each of these principles is composed of its
O'\\'ll form of matter and possesses its own laws of time,
space and motion. The most gross of those, the physical
body, is known as yupa, which becomes more and more
refined until we reach the universal self 6tma ; but the
circumstance which determines the individual's powers,
testS and advantages, or in short his character, is his
karma, which is the sum of his bodily, mental and spiritual
growth and is spread over many lives past and future;
in short, as man soweth, so must he reap ; and if in one
existence be is handicapped by any defect, mental or
physical, it may be regarded as the outcome of past delin-
quencies. This doctrine is practically common to both
Buddhism and Brahntinism.
After this digression, which was entered into for the
purpose of affording a fuller view of the theosophic con-
ception of human personality, we return to the constitution
of man. The ego existing in the Higher Mental World
cannot enter the Physical World until it has drawn around
itself a veil composed of the matter of these sphere<;: nor
can it think in any but an abstract manner without them-
its concrete ideas being due to them. Having assumed the
astral and physical bodres, it is born as a human being;
and having lived out its earth-life sojourns for a time in the
Astral World, until it can succeed in throwing off the
shackles of the astral body. When that is achieved
man finds himself living in his mental body. The stay in
this sphere is usually a long one-the strength of the
mental constitution depending upon the nature of the
thoughts to which he has habituated himself. But he is
not yet sufficiently developed to proceed to higher planes,
and once more he descends into the denser physical sphere
to again go through the same round. Although be come
from on high into these lower worlds, it is only through
that descent that a full recognition of the higher worlds is
developed in him.
In the Higher Mental World, the permanent vehicle is
a causal body, which consists of matter of the first, second
and third sub-divisions of that world. As the ego unfolds
his latent possibilities in the course of his evolution, this
matter is greatly brought into action; but it is only in the
perfect man, or adept, that it is devt>loped to its fullest
extent. In the causal body none of the possibilities of the
grosser bodies can manifest themselves.
The mental body is built up of matter of the four lower
sub-divisions of the Mental World, and expresses man's
concrete tboughts. Its size and shape are determined
by those of the causal vehicle.
While on earth the personality wears the physical, mental,
and astral bodies all at once. It is the astral which connects
him with the Astral World during sleep or trance (See
Astral Plane.) It is easy to see how the doctrine of rein-
carnation arose from this idea. The ego must travel from
existence to existence, physical, astral, mental, until it
transcend the Mental World and enter the higher spheres.
We have in this sketch attempted as far as possible
to eschew the oriental verbiage of the older theosophical
teachers, which it is understood is now 1·eplaced by more
modern terms, but this we have retained in some of the
lesser articles dealing with 1'heosophy.
The theosophic path to the goal of Nirvana is practically
derived from Buddhistic teaching, but there are also other
elements in it,- Kabalistic and Greek. The path is the
great work whereby the inner nature of the individual is
consciously transformed and developed. A radical alter-
ation must be made in the aims and motives of the ordinary
mortal. The path is long and difficult, and as has been
said extends over many existences. Morality alone is
insufficient to the full awakening of the spiritual faculty,
without which progress in the path is impossible. Some-
thing incomparably higher is necessary. The physical and
spiritual exercises recommended by Theosophy are those
formulated in the Hindu philosophical system known as
Raja Yoga. The most strenuous efforts alone can impel
the individual along the ~tb, and thus to mount by the
practice of Vidya, that higher wisdom which awakens the
latent faculties and concentrates effort in the direction oi
union with the Absolute. The way is described as long
and difficult, but as the disciple advances he becomes more
convinced of his ultimate success, by the possession of
transcendental faculties which greatly assist him to over-
come difficulties. But these must not be sought for their
own sake, as to gain knowledge of them for e"il purposes
is tantamount to the practice of Black Magic.
It is not pretended that in this brief sketch the whole of
the theosophical doctrine has been set forth, and the
reader who desires further information regarding it is
recommended to the many and excellent handbooks on the
subject which now abound.

Thomas tbe Rhymer: Scottish Soothsayer (circa, 1220.) It
is impossible to name the exact date which witnessed
the advent of the Scottish soothsayer, Thomas the Rhymer,
who is well known on account of his figuring in a fine old
ballad, duly included in Sir Walter Scott's Minstrelsy ofthe
Scottish BMtkr. But Thomas is commonly supposed to
have lived at the beginning of the thirteenth century,
that period being assigned because the name, " Thomas
Rimor de Ercildun," is appended as witness to a deed,
whereby one " Petrus de Haga de Demersyde " agrees to
pay half a stone of wax annually to the Abbot of Melrose,
and this " Petrus " has been identified with a person of
that name known to have been living about 1220. Ercildun
is simply the old way of spelling Earlston, a village in the
extreme west of Berwickshire, hard by the line demarking
that county from Roxburgb ; and it would seem that
Thomas held estates in this region, for he is mentioned as
a landed-proprietor by several early writers, most of whom
add that he did not hold his lands from the Crown, but
from the Earls of Dunbar. Be that as it may, Thomas
probably spent the greater part of his life in and around
Earlston, and a ruined tower there, singularly rich in ivy,
is still pointed out as having been his home, and bears his
name ; while in a wall of the village church there is a
lichened stone with the inscription :-
" Auld Rhymour's Race
Lies in this Place."
and, according to local tradition, this stone was removed
to its present resting place from one in a much older church,
long since demolished. Nor are these things the only
relics of the soothsayer, a lovely valley some miles to the
west of Earlston being still known as .. Rhymer's Glen " ;
and it is interesting to recall that Turner painted a water-
colour of this place, and no less interesting to remember
that Sir Walter Scott, when buying the lands which
eventually constituted his estate of Abbotsford, sought
eagerly and at last successfully to acquire the glen in
question. Naturally he loved it on account of its associa-
tions with the shadowy past, and Lockhart tells that many
of the novelist's happiest times were spent in this romantic
place ; while he relates how Maria Edgwortb visited it in.
Thomas the Rhymer 413 TH
1823, and that thenceforth Sir Walter used always to
speak of a certain boulder in the glen as the " Edgworth
stone," the lady WTitcr whom he admired so keenly having
rested here for a space. It ~ems probable, however, that
the glen was so named by Scott himself.
It is thought that Thomas died about 1297, and it is
clear that he had achieved a wide fame as a prophet, many
references to his skill in this relation being found in writers
who lived comparatively soon after him. A Harleian
manuscript in the British Mu~um, known to have been
written before 1320, discloses the significant phrase, ·• La
Comtesse de Donbar demanda a Thomas de Essedoune
quant Ia gucrc dcscoco prcndrcit fyn ; " but the lady in
question was not a contemporary of the prophet. In
Barbour's Bruce, composed early in the fourteenth century,
we find the poet sayin~.
" Sikerly
I hop Thomas prophecy
Off Hersildoune sail weryfied be."
Andro of Winton, in the Originate Cronykil of Scotland,
also makes mention of Thomas as a redoubtable prophet;
while Walter Bower, the continuator of Fordun's Scotic-
ronicon, recounts how once Rhymer was asked by t he
Earl of Dunbar what another day would bring forth,
whereupon he foretold the death of tbe king, Alexander
IIL, and the very next morning news of his .majesty's
decease was noised abroad. Blind Harry's Wa/lace,
written midway through the fifteenth century, likewise
contains an allusion to Thomas's prophesying capacities;
while coming to later times, Sir Thomas Gray, Constable of
Norbam, in his Norman-French Scalacronica, compiled
during his captivity at Edinburgh Castle in 1555. speaks
of the predictions of Merlin, \vhich like those of " Banaster
ou de Thomas de Ercildoune.... furount ditz en figure."
A number of predictions attributed to Thomas the Rhy-
mer are still current, for instance that weird verse which
Sir \Valter Scott made the motto of The Bride of La;mnu-
muir; and also a saying concerning a Border family with
which, as we have seen, the soothsayer was at one time
associated :
"Betide, betide, whate'er betide,
There'll aye be Haigs at Bemersyde."
It will be observed that both the foregoing are couched
in metre, yet there is really no sure proof that the sooth-
sayer was a poet. It is usually supposed that he acquired
the sobriquet of Rhymer because be ·was a popular minstrel
in his day, but the fact remains that Rymour was long a.
comparatively common surname in Berwickshire, and,
while it may have originated with Thomas, the assumption
has but slight foundation. Again, the prophet of Earlston
has been credited with a poem on the story of Sir Tristram,
belonging to the Arthurian cycle of romance, and the
Advocate's Library contains a manuscript copy of this,
probably written so early as 1300. However, while Sir
Walter Scott and other authorities believed in this ascrip-
tion, it is quite likely that the poem is but a paraphrase
from some French troubadour. For generations, however,
the Scottish pea~;~ntry continued to be influenced by the
sayings attributed to " True Thomas," as they named him,
as is witnessed by the public.•tion during comparatively
modern titncs of books containing the prophecies which he
is said to have uttered.

Thought.Reading : A term somewhat loosely applied to various
forms of apparent thought-transference, even where the
method employed is muscle-reading or actual fraud. It
must not be confused with telepathy, for, though both
terms.are som?timCS used synonymously, the latter implies
the d1rect actwn of one mmd on another, independent of
the ordinary sense-channels, while no such restrictions are
contained in the term " thought-reading." In early times,
when outbursts of ecstatic frenzy were ascribed to demoniac
possession, we find the ecstatics credited with the power to
read thoughts ; witches were supposed to be endowed with
the same faculty ; Paracclsus and the early magnetists
recognised its existence. The advent of spiritualism gave
to thought-reading a new impetus. It ·was now the spirits
who read the thoughts of the sitters and replied to them
with raps and table-turnings. Until quite recently, how-
ever, thought-readitzg was attributed either to occultism
or f,aud. Not only was the " ethereal vibration " theory
unthought of, but the phenomena of hypera!Sthesia and
" subconscious whispering " were very imperfectly under-
stood in their bearing on thoufht-readi,zg. Yet it is probable

Tibet : In this country, the stronghold of Buddhism, all
superstition circles around the national religion, which at
the same time has absorbed into itsel£ the aboriginal beliefs
and demonology. Nowhere perhaps has such a vast amount
of pure superstition crystallised around the kernel of
Buddhism,- the pure doctrines of which were found by the
Hindu conquerors of the Tibetans to be totally unsuited to
the Hunnish aborigines of the country, who before the
advent of Buddhism were in the aministic stage of religion.
This was allowed to revive and rites and ceremonies,
charms and incantations, of the very nature which Buddha
had so strongly condemned, clustered quickly around his
philosophy in Tibet. From this sprang the !antra system,
which is almost a purely magical one. It was founded by
Asanga, a monk of Peshawar, who composed its gospel, the
Yogachchara Bhumi Sastra in the sixth century A.D.
Basing his pantheon upon the debased system of Buddhism
then prevalent, Asanga reconciled it to native requirements
by placing a number of Saivite devil-gods and goddesses
in the lower Buddhistic heavens. These be made sub-
se;vient to the Buddha. His religion was speedily adopted
by the barbarian tribes of Tibet, who sacrificed readily to
the deities of this new religion. Very naturally they
exaggerated the magical side of it, their main object being
to obtain supernatural power by means of spoken spells
and words of power. A very considerable literature sprang
up in connection with the new faith, which has been
scathingly commented upon by disciples of the purer
B uddhism as being nothing more or less than mere barbarian
sorcery. Of course the monkish class of lamas found it
impossible altogether to ignore the tantra system, but
Tsongkapa in the middle of the fourteenth century unhesi-
tatingly condemned the whole system. The lamas had
and have an esoteric form of Buddhism, which has but
little in common with the tantra system of the people, but
we find them at festivals and so on unbending so far as to
represent the various devils and .fiends of this faith. As
literature, the tantras may be considered as a later develop-
ment of the puranas, but they are without any poetic
value. They arc regarded as gospels by the Saktas, or
worshippers of Kali, Durga or Purvati the wife of Siva, or
some other creative agency. They abound in magical
performances and mystic rites-a great many of which are
of a quite unspeakable character. Tboy usually take the
form of a dialogue between Siva and his wife. There were
originally sixty-four tantras, but as yet no satisfactory
scholarly examination has been made of them.

Timaeus of Locrls 414 Trance
Tlroreus or Locrls : The earliest known writer on the doctrines
of magic. The Tima:an theory of God, the Universe, and
the World-soul is thus set forth by Biisching : •· God
shaped the eternal unformed matter by imparting to it His
being. The inseparable united itself with the separable;
the unvarying with the variable ; and, moreover, in the
harmonic conditions of the Pythagorean system. To
comprehend all things better, infinite space was imagined
as divided into three portions, which are,-the centre, the
circumference, and the intermediate space. The centre
is most distant from the highest God, who inhabits the
circumferertce ; the space between the two contains the
celestial spheres. When God descended to impart His
being, the emanations from Him penetrated the whole of
heaven, and filled the same with imperishable bodies.
Its power decreased with the distance from the source.
and lost itself gradually in our world in minute portions,
over which matter was stm dominant. From this proceeds
the continuous change of being and decay below the moon,
where the power of matter predominates ; from this, also,
arise the circular movements of the heaven and the earth,
the various rapidities of the stars, and the peculiar motion
of the planets. Dy the union of God with matter, a third
being was cre.'l.ted, namely, the world-soul, which vitalizes
and regulates all things, and occupies the spacfl between
the centre and the circumference."

Tongues, Speaking and Writing in : The speaking and writing
i11 jo-reig11 tongues, or in unintelligible outpourings mistaken
for such, is a very old form of psychic phenomenon. It
was a frequent accompaniment of the epidemic ecstasy
which was so common in mediceval Europe. Thus the
Nuns of Loudon (q.v.) are declared to have understood
and replied to questions put to them in Latin, Greek,
Spanish, Turkish, and other even less-known languages.
The Tremblers of the Cevennes (q.v.) spoke in excellent
French, whereas French was to them a foreign language.
And practically every epidemic of the kind was character-
ised by the speaking in tongues, which seemed to be infec-
tious, and spread rapidly through whole communities.
In these early cases the phenomenon was ascribed to the
power of supernatural agencies, whether demons or angels,
who temporarily controlled the organism of the·· possessed."
But analogous instances are to be found in plenty in the
annals of modern spiritualism, where they are of course
regarded as manifestations of the spirits of the deceased
through the material organism of the medium. Campara·
tively early in the movement there are evidences ofspeaking
and writing in Latin, Greek, .French, Swiss, Spanish, and
Red Indian languages. Judge Edmonds, the well-known
American Spiritualist, testified to these faculties in his
daughter and niece, who spoke Greek, Spanish, Polish. and
Italian at various times, as well as Red Indian and other
languages. Some of these cases are well attested. Two
professional mediums (J. V. ~lansfield and A. D. Ruggles)
arc known to have written automatically in many lan-
guages, including Chinese and Gaelic, but whether or not
they had any previous acquaintance with these languages
remains at least a matter of doubt. In still more modern
times speaking in tonques has been practised, notably by
Helene Smith, who 1nvented the ":Martian language."
On the whole, we may take it that the so-called foreign
tongues were generally no more than a meaningless jumble
of articulate sounds, of which the spirits themselves some·
times purported to offer a translation. \Vbere there is
good evidence to show that the writings were actually
exe?uted in 2: foreign l~nguage, as in the case of the pro-
fesslOnal med1ums menboned abo_ve, there is generally some-
rea;;on to suppose~ former acquain~~ce with the language,
wh1ch the exaltation of memory 1nc1dental to the trance
state might revive. When unknown tongues were written the)~
were seldom found to correspond with any real language.

Tower or London : The jewel-room of the Tower of London is
reported to be haunted, and, in 186o, there was published
in Noles a•:d Queries by the late Edmund Lenthal Swifte,
Keeper of the Crown Jewels the account of a spectral
illusion witnessed by himself in the Tower. He says that in
Octob~r..1817, be ~as at s.uppcr with his ·wife, her sister,
and h1s httle boy, m the Slttlng·room of the jewel-house.
To quote his own words : " I had offered a glass of wine
and water to my wife, when, on putting it to her lips. she
exclaimed, ' Good God ! what is that ? • I looked up
and saw a cylindrical figure like a glass tube, seemmgly
about the thickness of my arm, and hovering between the
ceiling and the table ; its contents appeared to be a dense
fluid, white and pale azure. This lasted about two minutes,
when it began to move before my sister-in-law; then,
following the oblong side of the table, before my son and
myself. passing behind my wife, it paused for a moment
over her right shoulder. Instantly crouching down, and
with both hands covering her shoulder, she shrieked out,
' 0 Christ I it has sei:ted roe ! • " " It was ascertained,"
adds Mr. Swifte, " that no optical action from the outside
could have produced any manifestaion within, and hen~
the mystery has remained unsolved." Speaking of the
Tower, we learn from the same source how ·• one of the
night sentries at the jewel-house was alarmed by a figure-
like a huge bear issumg from underneath the jewel-room
door. He thrust at it with his bayonet which stuck in
the door. He dropped in a fit and was carried senseless
to the guard-room.... In another day or two the brave
and steady soldier died."
Tractatulus Alchlmae: (See Avicenna.)
Trance : An abnormal state, either spontaneous or induced,
bearing some analogy to the ordinary sleep-state, but
differing from it in certain marked particulars. The term
is loosely applied to many varied pathologic conditions-
e.g., hypnosis, ecstasy, catalepsy, somnambulism, certain
forms of hysteria, and the mediumistic trance. Some-
times, as in catalepsy, there is a partial suspension of the
vital functions ; generally, there is insensibility to pain
and to any stimulus applied to the sense-organs ; while
the distinguishing feature of the lraw;e is that the subject
retains consciousness and gives evidence of intelligence,
either his own normal intelligence or, as in cases of posses-
sion and impersonation, some foreign intelligence. In
hypnosis the subject, though indifferent to sensory stimuli
applied to his own ·person, has been known to exhibit a
curious sensitiveness to such stimuli applied to the person
of the hypnotist. (Sec Community of Sensation.) In
Ecstasy. which is frequently allied with hallucination, the
subject remains in rapt contemplation of some transcen-
dental vision, deaf and blind to the outside world. It
was formerly considered to indicate that the soul of the
ecstatic was viewing some great event distant in time or
place or some person or scene from the celestial sphere.
Now-a-days such a state is believed to be brougllt about
by intense and sustained emotional concentration on some
particular mental image. by means of which hallucination
may be induced.
The mediumistic ll'attee is recognised as having ar.
affinity with hypnosis, for the hypnotic trance, frequently
induced, may gradually become spontaneous, when it
exhibits strong resemblances to the tra1~ce of the medium.
Trance 415 Transmutation
This latter is, among spiritualists, " The Trance" par
excel/mce, and they object to the term being applied in any
case where there is no sign of spirit " possession." The
entranced medium- who seems able to produce this state
at will-frequently displays an exaltation of memory
(hypcrmesia), of the special senses (hyper.esthesi:.), and
even of the intellectual faculties. Automatic writing and
utterances arc generally produced in the trance state, and
often display knowledge of which the medium normally
knows nothing, or which, according to some authorities,
gives evidence of telepathy. Such are the tranu utterances
of Mrs. Piper, whose automatic phenomena have in recent
years provided a wide field for research for many men of
science both in Britain and on the Continent. Naturally
these phenomena, and those of all trance mediums, arc
referred by spiritualists to tho agency of disembodied
inteliigences- the spirits of the dead-acting through the
medium's physical organism, a notion which is akin to the
old idea of demoniac possession, to which spontaneous
trance was referred. Moreover, the IYance messages them-
selves purported to come from the spirits of deceased persons
and there arc many who sec no reason to disbelieve the
emphatic assertion of the " intelligence," especially when
that assertion is supplemented by an exact representation
of the voice, appearance, and known opinions of the
deceased friend or relative whose spirit it claims to be.
Such tra11ce impersonations supply a large part of the
evidence on which the structure of spiritualism rests.
There is, however, nothing to show that the information
concerning the deceased, thus reproduced, may not have
been obtained by normal means, or, at the most, telepathi-
cally from the minds of the sitters.
Trance Personalities : Trance messages purporting to come
from the medium's spirit control do not as a ~ule reveal
a very definite personality. The control reflects the
thoughts and opinions of the medium and the sitters,
possesses little knowledge that they do not possess, and is in
general a somewhat colourless creature. Yet not infre-
quently a trance medium is controlled by a spirit of distinct,
not to say distinguished, personality, whose education and
culture are on a much higher plane than the medium's
own, and whose ideas and opinions are quite independent.
Such spirits arc generally given distinguishing names.
They often control the medium alternately with other
controls. On the other hand, the medium has generally a
monopoly of one or more of these spirits, though sometimes
one control may be shared by a number of mediums.
Among those who may justly be regarded as the common
property of the mediumistic fraternity are the spirits of
certain great men-Virgil, Socrates, Shakespeare, Milton,
Benjamin Franklin, Victor Hugo, Swedenborg, and so on.
The messages delivered through their control seldom
resemble anything they Wl'Ote during their lives. It would
indeed be ludicrous to hold these great men responsible for
the feeble outpourings delivered in their name. But
these spirits come and go ; it is perhaps hardly accurate
to call ttu:m tranc~ psrsonalitiss at all. Among the best
known of the latter class arc the spirits who purported
to control the late Mr. Stainton Moses-Imperator, Rector,
Mentor, Prudens, and others. What the real names of
these controls may be is not known, for Mr. Moses only
revealed the secret to a few of his most intimate friends.
lmperator and Rector were among the controls of Mrs.
Piper in still more recent ye:~rs, and indeed much of her
automatic discourse did not come directly from the com-
municating spirits, but was dictated by them to Rector.
It is suggested, however, by Sir Oliver Lodge and other
authorities, that the controls of )Irs. Piper are not identical
with those of Stainton ~loses, by whom were written through
his hand the well-known Spirit Teachi•1gs, but are merely
masqueraders. But Mrs. Piper has several interesting
trance psrsonaWiss of her own, without borrowing from
anybody. One of her earliest controls wao; Sebastian
Bach, but ere loalg he g;Lve place to a spirit calling himself
" Dr. Phinuit," who held sway for a considerable time, but
gave place in his tum to George Pelham-" G.P." Pelham
was a young author and journalist who died suddenly in
1892. Soon after his death he purported to control Mrs.
Piper, and gave many striking proofs of his identity. He
constantly referred, with intimate knowledge, to the affairs
of Pelham, recognised his friends, and gave to each ~s due
meed of welcome. Not once, it is said, did he fail to
recognise an acquaintance, or give a greeting to one whom
he did not know. litany of Pelham's old friends did not
hesitate to see in him that which he claimed to be. Only
on one occasion, when asked for the names of two persons
who had been associated with him in a certain enterprise.
" G.P." refused, saying that as there was present one who
knew the names, his mea1tioning them would be referred to
telepathy! Later, however, he gave the names-incor-
rectly. When " G.P." ceased to take the principle part in
the control of :\Irs. Piper, his place was taken by Rector and
Imperator, as numtioned above. Another well-known
medium, Mrs. Thompson, had as her chief control " Nelly,"
a daughter of hers who had died in infancy; also a Mrs.
Cartwright, and others. These controls of Mrs. Thomson
are said not to have shown any very individual character-
istics, but to resemble Mrs. Thomson herself very strongly
both in voice and manner of speech, though :Mrs. Verrall
has stated that the impersonations gave an impression of
separate identity to the sitter. Mrs. Thomson's early
trance utterances were controlled by another band of
spirits, with even less individuality than those mentioned.
Frequently the mediums and investigators themselves, on
reaching the discarnate plane, become controls in their
turn. The late Mr. Myers, }!r. Gurney, Dr. Hodgson, and
Professor Sidgwick purported to speak and write through
many mediums, notably through Mrs. Piper and Mrs.
Thompson, Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Holland. Many of the
statements made by these controls were correct, and some
matters revealed which were apparently outside the scope
of the medium's normal knowledge, but at the same time
several fatal discrepancies were found to exist between the
controls and those they were supposed to represent. Thus
the script produced by Mrs. Holland contained grave
warnings, purporting to come from Myers, against Eusapia
Palladino and her physical phenomena, whereas Myers was
known to hold in his lifetime opinions favourable to the
physical manifestations. On the whole these trance
personalities show themselves decidedly coloured by the
personality of the medium. In cases where the latter was
acquainted with the control the tra11ce personality is pro-
portionately strong, whereas when there was no personal
acquaintance it is often of a neutral tint, and sometimes
bad guesses are made, as when Mrs. Holland represented
the Gurney control as of a brusque and almost discourteous
temperament. But such instances must not be taken
as impeaching the medium's good faith. Even where the
trance personality is patently the product of the medium's
own consciousness, there is no reason to suppose that there
is any intentional deception. While in some of the most
definite cases the evidence for the operation of a discarnate
intelligence is very good indeed, and has proved satis;actory
to many prominent investigators.
Transformation : (See Spells.)
Transmutation of Metals: (See Alcbemy.)
Transmutation or tbe Body : This is indeed the end and aim
of all Alchemy-to restore man to his primordial con-
dition of grace, strength, perfection, beauty and physical
immortality. With this in view the alchemists of all the
Tree Ghosts 416 Trevlsan, Bernard
ages have laboured to discover the secret of the Elixir of
Life, which mystics believed would, literally, achieve this
renewal of youth, and therefore immortality. Endless
receipts for this medicine have been given, and some
honestly believed they had attained it ; but all to no
purpose, and the great secret still remains hidden from
human eyes.
Tree Ghosts : Indian tree spirits. Says Mr. Crookes in his
Popular Religion of Northern India. •· These tru ghoss
are, it i5 needless to say, very numerous. Hence most
local shrines are constructed under trees ; and in one
particular tree, the Bira, the jungle tribes of Mirzapur
locate Bagheswar, the tiger godling, one of their most
dreaded deities. In the Konkan, according to Mr. Camp-
bell, the medium or Bhagat who becomes possessed is
called ]had, or • tree.' apparently because he is a favourite
dwelling-place for spirits. In the Dakkhin it is believed
that the spirit of the pregnant woman of Churcl lives in a
tree, and the Abors and Padams of East Bengal believe
that spirits in trees kidnap children. Many of these tree
spiritsappear in the folk-tales. Thus, Devadatta worshipped
a tree which one day suddenly clave in two and a nymph
appeared who introduced him inside the tree, where was a
heavenly palace of jewels, in which, reclining on a couch,
appeared Vidyatprabha. the maiden daughter of the king
of the Yakshas ; in another story the mendicant hears
inside a tree the Yaksba joking with his wife. So Daphne
is turned into a tree to avoid the pursuit of her lover."
Tree of Life, The, and The Tree of tbe Knowledge of Good
and Evil : Two of the trees planted by God in the Garden
of EdeLl, which were believed by St. Amb,.ose to be of
mystical significance. The former is understood to be the
manifestation of God, and the lattllT of the woddly wisdom
to which our human nature is too apt to incline.
Tremblers of the Cevennes : A Protestant caste of convul-
sonaires, who during the sixteenth century spread them-
selves from their centre in the Cevennes over almost the
whole of Germany. They possessed many points of
resemblance with cases of possession (q.v.), and are said
to have been .insensible to thrusts and blows with pointed
sticks and iron bars, as well as to the oppression of great
weights. They had visions, communicated with good and
evil spirits, and are said to have performed many miraculous
cures similar to the apostolic miTacles. They made use of
vCTy peculiar modes of treatment called grandes secours or
secours nuurtYiers, which are authenticated by the reports
of eye-witnesses and by judicial documents. Although
they were belaboured by the strongest men with heavy
pieces of wood and bars of iron weighing at least thirty
pounds, they complained of no injury, but of experiencing
a sensation of pleasure. They also were covered with
boards, on which as many as twenty men stood without
its being painful to them. They even boTe as many as
100 blows with a twenty-pounds weight, alternately
applied to the breast and the stomach with such force
that the room trembled, and they begged that the blows
might be laid on harder, as light ones only increased
their sufferings. Indeed only those who laid on the
heaviest and most strenuous blows were thanked by their
sick. It seemed that it was only when the power of these
blows had penetrated to the most vital parts that t.bey
experienced real relief. Ennemoscr explains this insen-
sibility to pain bystating that in his experience "spasmodic
convulsions maintain themselves against outward attempts,
and even the greatest violence, with almost superhuman
strength, without injury to the patient, as has often been
observed in young girls and women, where anyone might
have almost been induced to believe in supernatural
influence. The tension of the muscles increases in power
with the insensibility of the power, so that no outward
force is equal to it : and when it is attempted to check
the pa,.oxysm with force, it gains in intensity, and accord-
ing to some observers not less psychical than physical. ...
I have observed the same manifestations in children, in
Catholics, Protestants and Jews, without the least variation,
on which account I considllT it to be nothing more than an
immense abnormal and inharmonic lusus natuYar."
Trevlsan, Bernard : This Italian alchemist's life was a
curious and intensely pathetic one. Bent on discovering
the philosopher's stone, he began at an early age to lavish
huge sums of money on the pursuit; but again and again
he was baffled, and it was only when old age was stealing
upon him, and he had disbursed a veritable fortune, that
his labours were crowned with some measure of success.
Bernard Trivisan, Comte de Ia Marche, was born iu the
year 1406 at Padua, a town whose inhabitants were famous
for erudition throughout many centuries in the middle
ages. His fathe,. was a doctor of medicine, so it is probable
that Bernard received his initial training in science at home ;
while eTe he was out of his teens he began to devote himself
seriously to alchemy, having been lured thereto by reading
the woTks of the famous Eastern philosophers, Geber and
Rhasis. Bernard's father was rich. and accordingly,
whenever it was known that the young man was minded
to dabble in gold-seeking, he found himself surrounded by
charlatans offering counsel ; and his very first experiments
resulted in his spending upwards of three thousand crowns,
the bulk of which sum went into the pockets of the yo.uth's
fraudulent advisers. He was not discouraged, however;
and, finding new henchmen, and at the same time aug-
menting his learning by a close study of the writings of
Sacrobosco and Rupecissa, he proceeded to make a new
series of attempts. But these also proved futile, once
more the alchemist did no more than enrich his assistants,
and in consequence he vowed that henceforth he would
prosecute his researches single-handed.
Bernard now engaged in a long course ofsedulous reading,
while he also began to give much time to prayer,
thinking by this means to gain his desired end ; and anon
he started fresh experiments, expending on these some
six thousand crowns. But again his devotion and extrava-
gance went unrewarded, year after year went by in this
fashion, and betimes Bernard realised that he was past
the prime of life. yet had achieved nothing whatsoever.
His bitter disappointment engendered an illness, but scarcely
was he restored to health ere he heard th'llt one Henry, a
German priest, had succeeded i::\ creating the philosopher's
stone ; and thereupon Ber11ard hastened to GllTffiany,
accompanied by various other alchemists. After some
difficulty they made the acquaintance of the cleric in
question, who told them he would disclose all would they
but fumish a certain sum of money to procure the necessary
tools and materials ; so they paid as desired, yet having
devoted much time to watching the German at work they
found themselves no nearer the goal than befoTe.
This last piece of quackery opened Bernard's eyes, and he
proclaimed his decision of eschewing hermetic philosophy
altogetheT in the future-a decision which was warmly
applauded by his Tclatives, for already his researches bad
cost a king's ransom. But it soon tTanspired that the
alchemist was quite incapable of clinging to his resolution,
and, growin~ more ardent than ever, he visited Spain and
Great BritaLn, Holland and France, trying in each of
these countries to enlarge his stock of Learning, and to
make the acquaintance of others who were searching like
himself. Eventually he even penetrated to Egypt, Pcr£ia
and Palestine, while subsequently he travelled in Greece,
where he witnessed many alehemistic researches ; yet all
proved vain, and ultimate~y Bernard found. himself im-
poverished, and was forced to sell his parental estates.
Triad 417 Tumah
Being thus without so much as a home. he retired to the
Island o~ Rhodes, intending to live there quietly for the
rest of hiS days ; but even here his old passion continued
to govern him, and, chancing to make the acquaintance
of a priest who knew something of science, the thwarted
and ruined alchemist proposed that they should start
fresh experiments together. The cleric professed himself
'\villing to give all the help in his power, so the pair borrowed
a large sum of m;~ney to admit of their purchasing the
necessary paraphernalia ; and it was here, then, in this
secluded island, and while in a literally baakrupt con-
dition, that BeYnaYd made the wonderful discovery with
which he is traditionally credited. Doubtless the tradition
has little foundation in fact, yet at least the philosopher
deserved some reward for his indomitable if foolhardy
perseverance, and it is pathetic to recall that his death
occurred soon after the day of his triumph.
In contradistinction to the majority of his brother-
alchemists, BemaYd appears to have loved actual experi-
ments much better than writing about them. It is probable
however, that he was at least partly responsible for an
octavo volume published in 1643, Le Be1'nard d' Alchmague,
cum BernaYd Treve.<o ; while he is commonly credited with
another work also, La Philosophic Natu,elle des lv!etau~.
Herein he insists on the necessity of much meditation on
the part of the scientist who would create the philosopher's
stone, and this rather trite observation is followed by a
voluminous alchemistic treatise, most of it sadly obscure,
and demonstrating the author no great expert.
Triad : (See God.)
Triad Society : An ancient esoteric society of China. The
candidate scantily clothed, is brought into a dark room
by two members, who lead him to the President, before
whom he kneels. He is given a Jiving cock and a knife,
and in this posture he takes a complicated oath' to assist
his brethren in any emergency, even at the risk of his life.
He then cuts-off the head of the cock, and mingles it with
his own, the three assisting individuals adding some of their
own blood. After being warned that death will be his
portion should he divulge the secrets of the society, he is
initiated into them, and is entrusted with the signs of
recognition which are in triads. For example a member
must lift any object with three fingers only. This society,
originally altruistic, is now of a political character.

Tripod : (See Necromancy.)
Trithemius : The son of a German vine-grower, named
Heidenberg, received his Latinized appellation from
Trittheim, a village in the electorate of Treves, where he
was born in 1462. He might reasonably be included among
those earnest and enthusiastic souls who have persevered
in the pursuit of knowledge under difficulties ; for his mother,
marrying a second time, had no love for the offspring of
her first marriage. The young Trithemius was ill-fed, ill-
clothed, and over-worked. All day he toiled in the vine-
yards ; but the nights he was able to devote to the acquisi-
tion of knowledge, and then he stole away from his miserable
home, :\nd perused what books he could beg or borrow, by
the light of the moon. As his mind expanded he became
sensible of the vast stores of learning to which his cir-
cumstances denied him access. lie could not rest content
with the few grains of sand he had picked up on the sea-
shore. Extorting his small share of the patrimony be-
queathed by his father, he wandered away to Treves,
entered himself a student of its celebrated University, and
assumed the name of Tritltemius. His progress was now as
rapid as migbt be inferred probable from the intensity of
his aspirations and the keenness of his intellect. At the
age of twenty he had acquired the reputation of a scholar-
a reputation which was of greater advantage in the 15th
than it is in the 20th century. He was now desirous of
once more seeing the mother whom he did not love the
less because she had ill-used him, and in the winter of
1482 be quitted the cloistered shade of Treves on a solitary
journey to Trittheim. It was a dark day, ending in a
gloomy, fast-snowing night, and the good student, on his
arrival near Spannheim. found the roads impassable. He
sought refuge in a neighbouring monastery. There the
weather imprisoned him for several days. The imprison-
ment proved so much to the liking of Tritl~mius, that he
voluntarily took the monastic vows, and retired from the
world. In the course of two years he was elected abbot,
and devoting all his little fortune lo the repair and im-
provement of the monastery, he gained the love and
reverence of the brotherhood, whom he inspired with his
own love of leatning. But after a rule of one-and-twenty
years, the monks forgot all his benefits, and remembered
only the severity of his discipline. They broke out in
revolt, and elected another abbot. The deposed Triihe-
mius quitted Spa.nnheim, and wandered from place to
place, until finally elected Abbot of St. James of Wurzburg,
where he died in 1516.
His fame as a magician rests on very innocent foundations
He devised a species of short-hand called steoganographia,
which the ignorant stigmatized as a cabalistical and necro-
mantic writing, concealin~ the most fearful secrets. He
wrote a treatise on the subJeCt ; another upon the supposed
administration of the world by its guardian angels-a
revival of the good and evil geniuses of the Ancients-
which William Lilly translated into English in 1647 ; a
third upon Geomancy, or divination by means of lines and
circles on the ground ; a fourth upon Sorcery; and a fifth
upon Alchemy. In his work upon Sorcery he makes the
earliest mention of the popular story of Dr. Faustus, and
records the torments he himself occasionally suffered from
the malice of a spirit named lludekin. He is said to have
gratified the Emperor Maximilian with a vision of his
deceased wife, the beautiful Mary of Burgundy, and was
reputed to have defrayed the expenses of his monastic
establishment at Spannheim by the resources which the
Philosopher's Stone put at his disposal. His writings show
him to have been an amiable and credulous enthusiast
but his sincere and ardent passion for knowledge may well
incline us to forgive the follies which he only shared with
most of the scholars and wise men of his age.

Trivah : Among the natives of Borneo the tYivah, or feast of
the dead, is celebrated after a death has taken place.
A panel containing a representation of Tempon-teloris'
ship of the dead (q.v.) is generally set uo at the triva!L and
sacrifices of fowls are offered to it. Until the trivah has
been celebrated the soul's soul is unable to reach the

Tumah: According to the Kabala, physical or moral unclean-
ness. The latter is divided into three main divisions-
idolatry, murder, and immorality. Sin, says the Sall!e
authority, not only rendered imperfect man himself, but
also affected the whole of nature, even to the sphere of
angels, and the Divinity himself. In physical uncleanness
there is a coarserand a more subtle form. The latter causes
a dimness in the soul which is most keenly felt by those

who are nearest to sacred things. Organic things which
come into contact with the human body are more liable
to the Tumah than remoter things. The human corpse is
more unclean than that of the lower animals, beCause its
more complex nature involves a more. repulsive decay.

Univercmlum, The: An American _periodical havirig for its
aim " the establishment of a umversal System of Truth,
the Reform and Reorganisation of Society." It made its
first appearance in December, 1847. under the editorship
of Andrew Jackson Davis (q.v.), and lived for about a year
and a half. Its supporters and contributors looked for a
new revelation to supplement those of the Old and New
Testaments, Swcdenborg and Fourit-.r. Attention was
given in its pages to prophecy, clairvoyance, somnam-
bulism and trance phenomena generally, while it also
taught •· an interior and spiritual philosophy " whose
central idea was that God was the infinitely intelligent
Essence which pervaded all things- the Universal Soul,
expressing itself in the material universe and the !awe;
of nature as the human soul expresses itself through the
material body. Though the Rochester Rappings broke
out some time before the U11i11erca:lum came to an end, the
adherents of the paper did not seem to connect the distur-
bances with their propa~anda. However, many of those
who were associated w1th the Univerccclum afterwards
became editors of spiritualistic papers. In July, 18-+9
the paper passed out of the hands of A. J. Davis, and became
The Present Age, under the editorship of W. 1\I. Channing.
Universal Balm : An elbcir composed by the alchemists, which
formed a sovereign remedy for every malady, and would
even bring the dead to life.
Universities (Occult) : In many works on the occult sciences
allusions are made to schools and universities for the in-
struction of those who were drawn to thenr. Thus we
are told that Salamanca abounded in such schools ; that
Jechicl, a Jewish Rabbi of medireval France, ltept such a
seminary ; and there is reason to believe that in all ages
such institutions were by no means uncommon. Balzac
alludes to one of them in a well-known novel The Secret of
Ruggier, which he places at the time of Catherine de Medici.
He says, " At this epoch the occult sciences were cultivated
V.'ith an ardour which put to shame the incredulous spirit
of our century.... The universal protection accorded to
these sciences by the ruling sovereigns of the times was
quite remarkabTc." He goes on to say that at the commence-
ment of the sixteenth century Ruggier ·was the member of
a secret university for the study of the occult sciences,
where astrologers, alchemists, and others. studied several
branches of hidden knowledge; but he gives no details as
to its locality, or as to the exact nature of its curriculum.
There is no doubt that during the Middle Ages many extra-
mural lecturers taught alchemy and kindred subjects at the
great 1miversities. Thus Paracelsus lectured on alchemy
at the University of Basel, and he was preceded and followed
there and elsewhere by many illustrious professors of that
and other occult arts. M. Figuicr in his work Alchemy and
the Alchemists (See Alchemy), alludes to a school in Paris
frequented by alochemists, which he himself attended in the
middle of the last century. The school---an ordinary
chemical laboratory through the day-became in the
evening a centre of the most elaborate alchemical study,
where Figuicr met many alchemical students, visionary
and practical, with one of whom he had a prolonged argu-
ment. which we have outlined at consider~ble length in
the article '' Alchemy." Many professors of the occult
sciences in early and later times drew around them con-
siderable bands of students and assistants and formed
distinct schools for the practice of magic and alchemy,
principally the latter. The College of Augurs in Rome and
the Calmecac of Ancient Mexico arc distinct examples of
institutions for the study of at least one branch of occult
science, and in this connection the House of Wisdom of
the Ismaelite sect at Cairo may be mentioned. It is
likely that in ancient Egypt and Dabylonia, institutions of
the kind flourished more or less in secret. Mme. Blavatsky
insisted to the last that a great " school " of illuminated
occult adepts flourished in Tibet ; but as nobody except
herself and her immediate friends ever saw them, or
had any dealings with them ; and as all proof is against
the existence of such a semi-divine brotherhood, her
statements must be taken as being ~omewhat open to
question. There is, however, no reason to doubt that
bodies of men who study the higher occultism do exist in
various Asiatic centres, whatever the nature of their
powers, supernormal or otherwise, may be. Vague rumours
reach students of occultism every now and again of schools
or colleges on the continent of Europe, the purpose of
which is to train aspirants in the occult arts ; but as
definite information is seldom forthcoming regarding
these, they can only be merely alluded to here. The
" School for the Discoveryof the Lost Secrets of Antiquity."
which flourishes at Lotus-land, California, was founded by
Catherine Tingley late in the nineteenth century, and is
under theosophical n!gime. Numerous small bodies for
the study of occultism exist in every town of considerable
size in Europe and America ; but these cannot be dignified
even by the name of " schools," as they arc for the most
part private aff.Urs, the occultism ofwhich is of an extremely
amateurish and innocent character.
Ura : A spirit. (See Babylonia.)
Urgund: (See Boehme.)
Urlm and Thummlm: A means of divination employed by
the ancient Hobrews, and which it was believed consisted
of a species of casting lots. Their form and method of use
is uncertain, but £rom passages in the Book of Samuel, it
seems probable that (t) they were used to determine guilt
and innocence, and (2) that this was done by means of
categorical questions, to which the suspected person
answered " Ycs " or " No." They appear to have been
the prerogative of the priesthood.
Valentine, Basil 419
v
Valentine, Basil : This German adept in hermetic philosophy
is commonly supposed to have been born at 1\iayence
towards the close of the fourteenth century. As a young
man he espoused holy orders, and it is recorded that he
entered the Abbey of St. Peter, at Erfurt, and eventually
became its Prior; but otherwise very little is known con-
cerning him, and even the date of his death is uncertain.
He appears to have been a very modest person, for accord-
ing to Olaus Borrichius, the author of De OrJu ~t Progressu
Chemia!, Valentine imprisoned aU the manuscripts of his
scientific writings inside one of the pillars of the Abbey
Church ; and there they might have remained for an
indefinite period, but a thunderstorm chanced ultimately
to dislodge them from their curious hiding-place. It is
possible, of course, that this incarceration was not alto-
gether due to modesty on the writer's part, and arose
rather from his dreading a visitation from the Inquisition
in the event of their discovering his alchemistic proclivities;
but be that as it may, Valentine's works certainly mark him
as a very shrewd man and a capable scientist. In con-
tradistinction to most analo~ous medireval literature, his
treatises are not all couched m Latin, some of them being
in high Dutch and others in the author's native German ;
and prominent among those in the latter tongue is The
Triumphal Chariot of Antimony, first published at Leipsic
in r624. Heroin Vale11tine exalts antimony as an excellent
medicine, while the volume likewise embodies a lengthy
metrical treatise on tho philosopher's stone, the writer
contending that whoso would discover and use this must
do charitable deeds, mortify the flesh, and pray without
ceasing.
As re~ards tho alchemist's further writings, it behoves
to mention his Apocalypsis Chymica, De Microcosmo degue
}.fagno Mtmdi /lfysterio et }11edeciua Hominis and Prac:Jica
un.l cum duodecim Clavibus et Appendice. All these were
originally published in Germany at the beginning of the
seventeenth century, and divers passages in them demon-
strate that the author understood the distillation of
brandy, and was acquainted with the method of obtaining
chlorohydric acid from salt-water ; while moreover,
reverting to his faith in antimony, he bas been credited
with having been the first to extract this from sulpburet.
Vampire: (Russian Vampir, South Russian upuir, probably
from the root pi, to drink, with the prefix va, or av.) A
dead person who returns in spirit form from the grave for
the purpose of destroying and sucking the blood of living
persons, or a living sorcerer who takes a special form
for the same purpose. The conception of the
vampiye is rifcst among Slavonic peoples, and especially
in the Balkan countries, and in Hungary, Bohemia,
Moravia, and Silcsia, and in these territories from I730- 35
there was a well-marked epidemic of vampirism, but it is
by no means confined to them. In White Russia and tile
Ukraine it is believed that vampires are generally wizards
or sorcerers, but in Bulgaria and Serbia it is thought that
any corpse over which a cat or a dog jumps or over which
a bird has flown is liable to become a vampire. In Greece
(q.v.) a vampire is known as a brotzcolaia or bou,.habahos,
which has been identified with the Slavonic name for
" werewolf" (q.v.), vlhodlah, or wliodlak. The vampire,
too, is often supposed to steal the heart of his victim and
to roast it over a slow fire, thus causing interminable
amorous longings.
Marks of Vampirism.-Vampirism is epidemic in char-
acter. Where one instance is discovered it is almost
invariably followed by several others. This is accounted
for by the circumstance that it is believed that the victim
of a vampire p!11es and dies and becomes in turn a vampire
Vampire
himself after death, and so duly infects others. On the
disinterment of a suspected vampire various well-known
signs are looked for by experienced persons. Thus, i!
several boles about the breadth of a man's finger, are
observed in the soiJ above the grave the vampire character
of its occupant may be suspected. On unearthing the
corpse it is usually found with wide-open eyes, ruddy and
life-like complexion and lips and a general appearance of
freshness, and showing no signs of corruption. It may
also be found that the hair and nails have grown as in life.
On the throat two small livid marks may be !coked for.
The coffin is also very often full of blood, the body has a
swollen and gorged appearance, and the shroud is fre-
quently half-devoured. The blood contained in the veins
of the corpse is found on examination to be in a fluid
condition as in life, and the limbs arc pliant and flexible
and have none of the ri$'idity of death.
Examples of Vampinsm.-Many well-authenticated ex-
amples of vampirism exist. Charles Ferdinand de Schertz
in his work Magia Posthuma printed at Olmutz in 1706
relates several stories of apparitions of tllis sort, and
particularises the mischief done by them. One, among
otl1ers, is of a herdsman of the village of Blow near the
town of Kadam in Bohemia, who appeared for a considerable
length of time, and visited several persons, who all
died within eight days. At last, the inhabitants of Blow
dug up the herdsman's body, and fixed it in the ground
with a stake driven through it. The man, even in this
condition, laughed at the people that were employed about
him, and told them they were very obliging to furnish him
with a stick with which to defend himself from the dogs.
The same night he extricated himself from the stake,
frightened several persons by appearing to them, and
occasioned the death of many more than he had hitherto
done. He was then delivered into the hands of the hang-
man, who put him into a cart, in order to burn him without
the town. As they went along, the carcass shrieked in the
most hideous manner, and threw about its arms and legs,
as if it had been alive ; and upon being again run through
with a stake, it gave a loud cry, and a great quantity of
fresh, florid blood issued from the wound. At last, the
body was burned to ashes, and this execution put a final
stop to the spectre's appearing and infecting tl1e village.
Calmet in his Dissertation on Vampires appended to his
Dissertation upo11 Apparitions (English translation, 1759),
gives several well authenticated instances of vampirism
as follows :-
" It is now about fifteen years since a soldier, who was
quartered in the house of a Haidamack peasant, upon the
frontiers of Hungary, saw, as he was at the table with his
landlord, a stranger come in and sit down by them. The
master of the house and the rest of the company were
strangely terrified, but the soldier knew not what to make
of it. The next day the peasant died, and, upon the
soldier's enquiring into the meaning of it, he was told that
it was his landlor~·s father, who had been dead and buried
above ten years, that came and sat down at table, and
gave his son notice of his deatll.
" The soldier soon propa~ated the story through his
regiment, and by this means 1t reached the general officers,
who commissioned the count de Cabrcras, a captain in
Alandctti's regiment of foot, to make an exact enquiry
into the fact. The count, attended by several officers, a
surgeon, and a notary, came to the house, and took the
deposition of all the family, who unanimously swore that
the spectre was the landlord's father, and that aU the
soldier had said was strictly true. The same was also
attested by all the inhabitants of the village.
Vampire 420 Vampire
" In consequence of this the body of the spectre was
dug up. and found to be in the same state as if it bas been
but just dead, the blood like that of a living pel'son. The
count de Cabreras ordered its bead to be cut off, and the
corpse to be buried again. . He then proceeded to take
depositions against other spectres of the same sort, and
particularly against a man who bad been dead above
thirty years, and had made his appearance three several
times in his own house at meal-time. At his first visit he
had fastened upon the neck of his own brother, and sucked
his blood : at his second, he had treated one of his children
in the same manner; and the third time, he fastened upon
a servant of the family, and all three died upon the spot.
" Upon this evidence. the count ge.ve orders that he
should be dug up, and being found, like the first, with his
blood in a fluid state, as if he had been alive, a great nail
was drove through h!s temples, and he was buried again.
The count ordered a third to be burnt, who had been dead
above sixteen years, and was found guilty of murdering two
of his own children by sucking their blood. The com,-
rnissioner then made his report to the general officers; who
sent a deputation to the emperor's court for further direc-
tions ; and the emperor dispatched an order for a court.
consisting of officers, lawyers, t>hysicians, chirurgeons, and
some divines, to go and enqu1re into the cause of·these
extraordinary events, upon the spot.
" The gentleman who acquainted me with all these
particulars, had them from the count de Cabreras himself, at
Fribourg in Brisgau, in the year 1730."
Other instances alluded to by Calmet are as follows :-
"In the part of Hungary, known in Latin by the name
of oppida Heidonun:, on the other side of the Tibiscus,
vulgarly called the Teyss ; that is, between that part of
this river which waters the happy country of Tockay, and
the frontiers of Transylvania, the people named Heydukes
have a notion that there are dead persons. called by them
vampires, which suck the blood of the living, so as to make
them fall away visibly to skin and bones, while the car-
casses themsclv~ like leeches, are tilled with blood to such
a degree that it comes out at all the apertures of their
body. This notion bas lately been confirmed by several
facts, which I think we cannot doubt the truth o:f, con-
sidering the witnesses who attest them. Some of the most
considerable of these facts I shall now relate.
" About five years ;\go, an IIeyduke, named Arnold
Paul, an inhabitant of ~ledreiga. was killed by a cart full
of hay that fell upon him. About thirty days after his
death. fout persons died suddenly, v.ith all the symptoms
usually attending those who are killed by vampires. It
was then·remembered that this Arnold Paul had frequently
told a story of his having been tormented by a Turkish
vamp1re, in the neighbourhood of Cassova, upon the borders
of Turkish Servia (for the notion is that those who have been
passive vampires in their life-time become active ones after
death; or, in other words, that those who have had their
blood sucked become suckers in their turn) but that he had
been cured by eating some of the earth upon the vampire's
grave, and by rubbing himself with his blood. This I?re-
caution. however, did not hinder him from being gmlty
himself after his death ; for, upon digging up his corpse
forty da.ys after his burial, he was found to have all the
marks of an arch-vampire. His body was fresh and ruddy,
his hair, beard, and nails were grown, and his veins were
full of fluid blood. which ran from all parts of his body
upon the shroud that be was buried in. The hadt1agy, or
bailiff of the village. who was present at the digging up of the
corpse, and was very expert in the whole business of
vampirism, ordered a sharp stake to be drove quite through
the body of the deceased, and to let it pass through his
heart, which was attenrlod with a hideous cry from the
carcass, as if it had been alive. This ceremony being
performed, they cut off the head, and burnt the body to
ashes. After this, they proceeded in the same manner
with the four other persons that died of vampirism, lest
they also should be troublesome. But aU these executions
could not hinder this dreadful prodigy from appearing
again last year, at the distance of five years from its first
breaking out. In the space of three months, seventeen
persons of different ages and sexes died of vampirism. some
without any previous illness, and others after languishing
two or three days. Among others, it was said, that a girl,
named Stanoska, daughter of the Heyduke jotuitzo, went
to bed in perfect health, but awoke in the middle of the
night, trembling. and crying out that the son of the Hey-
duke Millo, who died about nine weeks before, had almost
strangled her while she was asleep. From that time she
fell into a languishing state, and died at three days' end.
Her evidence against Millo's son was looked upon as a
proof of his being a vampire, and, upon diggiug up his body,
he was found to be such.
" At a consultation of the principal inhabitants of the
place, attended by physicians and chirurgeons. it was
considered bow it was possible that the plague of vam-
pirism should break out afresh, after the precautions that
had been taken some years before : and, at last. it was
found out that the original offender, Arnold Paul, had not
only destroyed the fo.ur persons mentioned above, but had
killed several beasts. which the late vampire.<, and particu-
larly the son of Millo, bad fed upon. Upon this foundation
a resolution was taken to 0ig up all the persons that had
died within a certain time. Out of forty were found.
seventeen, with all the evident tokens of vampirism ; and
they had all stakes drove through their hearts, their heads
cut off, their bodies burnt, and their ashes throwu into
the river.
"All these several enquiries and executions were carriEd
on ....>ith all the forms of law, and attested by several officers
who were in garrison in that country. by the chirurgeon-
majors of the regiments, and by the principal inhabitants
of the place. The original papers were all sent, in January
last. to the Imperial council of war at Vienna, which had
issued out a commission to several officers, to enquire
into the truth of the fact."
Methods of Extirpatirm.-The commonest methods of the
extirpation of vampires are-(a) beheading the suspected
corpse; (b) taking out the heart ; (c) impaling the cprpse
with a white-thorn stake (in Russia an aspen), and (d)
burning it. Sometimes more than one or all of these
precautions is taken. Instances are on record where the
graves of as many as thirty or forty persons have been
disturbed during the course of an epidemic of vampirism
and their occupants impaled or beheaded. Persons who
dread the visits or attacks of a vampir~ sleep with a wreath
made of garlic 'round the neck, as that esculent is supposed
to be especially obnoxious to the vampire. When impaled
the vampire is usually said to emit a dreadful cry, but it
has been pointed out that the gas from the intestines
may be forced through the throat by the entry of the stake
into the body, and that this may account for the sound.
The method of discovering a vampire's grave in Serbia is to
place a virgin boy upon a coal-black stallion which has never
served a marc and marking the spot where he will not pass.
An officer quartered in \Vallachia wrote to Calmet as
follows, giving him an iMtance of this method :-
.. At the time when ..,.,.e were.quartered at Temeswar in
Wallachia, there died of this disorder two dragoons of the
company in which I \Yas cornet, and several more who had
it would have died also, if the corpor.:i of the company
had not put a stop to it, by applying a remedy commonly
made use of in that country. It is of a very singular kind,
Vampire 421 Vaulderle
and, though infallibly to be depended on, I have never met
with it in any Dispensatory.
"They pick out a boy, whom they judg& to be too your.g
to have lost his maidenhead, and mount him bare upon a
coal-black stone-horse, which has never leaped a mare.
This virgin-pair is led about the church-yard, and across
all the graves, and wherever the animal stops, and refuses to
go on, in spite of all the whipping they can give him, they
conclude they have discovered a vampire. Upon opening
the grave, they find a carcass as fleshy and fa:r as if the
person were only in a slumber. The next step is to cut
off his head with a spade, and there issues from the wound
such a quantity of fresh and 1lorid blood, that one would
swear they had cut the throat of a man in full health and
vigour. They then fill up the pit, and it may be depended
on that the disorder will cease, and that all who were ill
of it will gradually get strength, like people that recover
slowly after a long illness. Accordingly this happened to
our troopers, who were attacked with the distemper. I
was at that time commanding officer of the troop, the
captain and lieutenant being absent, and was extremely
angry at the corporal for havin~ made this experiment
without me. It was with great dtfficulty that I prevailed
with myself not to reward him with a good cudgel, a
thing of which the officers of the emperor's service are
usually very liberal. I would not, for the world, have been
absent upon this occasion, but there was now no remedy."
A Bulgarian belief is that a wizard or sorcerer may entrap
a vampire by placing in a bottle some food for '"'hich the
vampire has a partiality, and on his entry in the shape of
fiufi or straw, sealing up the flask and throwing it into the
fire.
Scientific Theories of Vampi, ism.-Thc English custom of
piercing suicide's bodies with a stake would appear to be
a survival of the belief in vampirism. Such demons are
also to be seen in the Polynesian Iii, the Malayan nantu
penyardin, a dog-headed water-demon, and the kepnn of
the Karcns, which under the form of a wizard's head and
stomach devours human souls. Tylor considers vampires
to he •• causes conceived in spiritual form to account for
specific facts of wasting disease." Alanasief regards
them as thunder-gods and spirits of the storm who during
winter slumber in their cloud-coffins to rise again in spring
and draw moisture from the clouds. But this theory will
scarcely recommend itseU to anyone with even a slight
kno',VIedge of mythological science. Calmet's difficulty in
believing in vampires was that he could not understand how
a .spirit could leave its gTave and return thence with pon-
derable mat ter in the form of blood, leaving no traces
showin~ that the surface of the earth above the grave had
been stirred. But this view might be combated by the
theory of the precipitation of matter.

of sorcery. Most of the unhappy creatures confessed to
have attended the " Witch's Sabbath," and the strange

pronounced at Arras in 146o upon five women, a painter,

in manner following, that is to say :-' That when they
wished to go to the said Vaulderie, they, with an ointment
given to them by the devil, anointed a small wooden rod
and their palms and their hands ; then they put the wand
between their legs, and soon they flew wherever they
wished to go, over fair cities, woods and streams ; and the
devil carried them to the place where they should hold
their assembly, and in this place they found others, and
tables placed, loaded with wines and viands ; and there
t hey found a demon in the form of a goat, a dog, an ape,
or sometimes a man ; and they made their oblation and
homage to the said demon, and adored him, and ~ieldcd
up to him their souls, and all, or at least some portton, of
their bodies ; t hen, with burning candles in their hands,
t hey kissed the rear of the goat-devil. ... . (Here the
Inquisitor becomes untranslatable).. . .. And this homage
done, they trod and trampled upon the Cross, and befouled
it with their spittle, in contempt of Jesus Christ, and the
Holy Trinity, then turned their backs towards heaven and
the firmament in contempt of God. And after they had
all eaten and drunk well, they had carnal intercourse all
together, and even the devil assumed the guise of man and
woman, and had intercourse with both sexes. And many
other crimes, most filthy and detestable, they committed,
as much against God as agcinst nature, which the ~aid
Inquisitor did not dare to name, that innocent ears mtght
not be told of such villainous enormites.' "
Vecchla Rellglone, La i22 Villars
The eagerness displayed by the Inquisitor and his
acolytes so excited the public mdignation, that at the
close of the year r16o the judges did not dare any longer
to condemn to death the unfortunate wretches accused, it
is said only for the purpose of depriving them of their
property. As in the case of all great wrongs, a reaction set
in-a re-action in favour of the right ; and thirty years
later, when the county of Artois had been re-united to the
Crown, the Parliament of Paris declared, on the 2oth of
May, 1491, these trials " abusive, void, and falsely made,"
and condemned the heirs of the duke of Burgundy and the
principal judges to an amend of 500 Parisian livres, to be
distributed as a reparation among the heirs of the victims.

Vehm-3erichte : A secret tribunal which during the Middle
Ages exercised a peculiar jurisdiction in Germany and
especially in Westphalia. Its origin is quite uncertain.
The sessions were often held in secret, and the uninitiated
were forbidden to attend them on pain of death. The most
absurd stories have been circulated concerning thero,-
that they met in underground chambers and so forth.
These have been discounted by modern research. Far from
dabbling in the occult, these courts frequently punished
persons convicted of witchcraft and sorcery.
Veleda: A prophetess amon~ the ancient Germans, of whom
Tacitus says : " She exerctscs a great authority, for women
have been held here from the most ancient times to be
prophetic, and, by excessive superstition, as divine. The
fame of Tleleda stood on the very highest elevation, for she
foretold to the Germans a prosperous issue, but to the
legions their destruction! Veleda dwelt upon a high tower,
whence messengers were dispatched bearing her oracular
counsels to those who sought them ; but she herself was
rarely seen, and none was allowed to approach her. Cerca-
lis is said -to have secretly begged her to let the Romans
have better success in war. The Romans, as well as
those of her own race, set great store on her prophecies,
and sent her valuable gifts. In the reign of the Emperor
Vespasian she was honoured as a goddess."
Veltis: An evil spirit who assaulted St. Margaret but was
overcome by her. On being asked by St. Margaret who
he was and whence he came, he replied : " My name •s

when the Babylonians, in the hope of finding treasure dug
up the cauldron and opened it, we all made our escape.
Since that time our efforts have been directed to the des-
truction of righteous persons; and I have long been
striving to turn thee from the course thou hast em-
braced."
Verdelet: A demon of the second order, master of ceremonies

before the sun had risen. Later sorcerers followed the
same usage, and the demo.nologists believe that in order to

Villanova, Arnold de: Arnold de Villanova was a physician
by profession, and is reported to have been something of a
theologian besides a skilled alchetnist. His natal place
has never been determined, but Catalonia. Milan and
Montpellier have all been suggested ; while as to the precise
date of his advent, this too is uncertain yet appears to
have been about the middle of the thirteenth century.
Anr.old studied medicine for many years at the Sorbonne
in Paris, which in medireval times was the principal
European nursery of physicians ; and thereafter be
travelled for a long time in Italy, while subsequently he
penetrated to Spain. Here, however, he heard that a
friend of his was in the hands of the dreaded Inquisition ;
and, fearing that he likewise might be trepanned by that
body, he withdrew speedily to Italy. For a considerable
period he lived at Naples, enjoying there the friendly
patronage of the Neapolitan sovereign, and spending his
time less in the actual practice of his profession than in the
compilation of various scientific treatises ; while at a later
date he was appointed physician in ordinary to Pope
Clement V., so presumably the rest of his life was spent
mainly at Rome, or possibly at Avignon. MeamThile
his interest in alchemy h;>d become widely known, and
indeed many people declared that his skill herein was
derived from communications with the arch-fiend himself,
and that the physician accordingly deserved nothing less
than burning at the stalce : while he also elicited particular
enmity from the clergy by sneering openly at the monastic
regime, and by declaring boldly that works of charity are
more acceptable.to God than the repetition of paternoste..s.
Thanks to Papal favour, nevertheless, Arnold went un-
scathed by his enemies ; but soon after his death, which
occurred about the year I3IO, the Inquisition decided that
they had dealt too leniently with the deceased, and in con-
sequence they signified their hatred of him, by ordering
certain of his writings to be burned publicly at Tarragona.
Arnold wa$ acquainted with the preparation of oil of
turpentine and oil of rosemary, while the marcasite fre-
quently mentioned by him is supposed to be identical with
bismuth. His most important treatises are his Thesaurus
Thesaurorum., Rosariurn Philosophorum, Speculam A lchemitZ
and Perfecluf1! Magislerum; while two others of some
moment arc his Testamentum and Scientia Scientice. A
collected edition of his works was issued in 1520, while
several writings from his pen are embodied in the Biblio-
theca Chemica Curiosa of Mangetus, published in 1702.
Villars, l'Abbe de MonUaucon de: French Mystic (1635-1673.)
This Churchman, author and mystic was what the French
style" un meridional," being a nativt. of ~outhern Franch.
He was born in 1635 at Toulouse, no.t very !ar from the
seaport town of Bordeaux; and at an C\i.tiY age he espoused
holy orders, while in 1667 be left tile &outh ana came to
Paris, eager to win fame as a preacher. Kor did this
ambition of his go wholly Wlgratified, his eloquence in the
pulpit winning him numerous admirers ; but he soon grew
Vi\lars 423 Visions
more interested in literature than in clerical affairs, and
in 1670 he published his first and most important book,
Comle dll Gabalis. Ostensibly a novel, this volume is largely
a veiled satire on the writings of La Calprencde, at this
time very popular both in France and in England ; but
the satirical element in Villars' paper is supplemented by a
curious blend of history, philosophy and mysticism ; and,
as much of the last-named is of a nature distinctly hostile
-to the dogmas of Rome, the a\lthor soon found himself in
iU odour with his brother clerics. Probably it was for this
reason that he renounced the pulpit, yet his literary
activities were not vitiated by persecution; and in 1671
he issued De Ia Dtlicetesse, a speculative treatise, couched
in the form of dialogues, in which the author takes the
part of one, a priest who had lately been writing
in opposition to Port Royal doctrines. Like its predecessor
this new book made a considerable stir, and Villars began
to write voluminously, at the same time plunging deeply
into the study of various kinds o! mysticism ; but his
activities were suddenly terminated in an unexpected
fashion, for in 1673 he was murdered on the public high·
road not far from Lyons, whither he was journeying from
Paris. Presumably he had incurred the hatred of some one
but the question is shrouded in mystery; and, be the
solution what it may, no attempt appears to have been
made to frustrate the posthumous publication of divers
works from Villa!'s' pen. Within the first decade succeed·
ing his death three such works appeared, L'A mottr sa1:s
Fai.blesse, A 1111e de JJretague et A ilmanzaris, and Critique
de la Berenice de Racine et de Comeille, the last-named
subsequently winning the enconiums of a shrewd judge,
Mme. de Sevignf>; while so late as 1715 a further production
by Villars was issued, a sequel to the Comte du Gabalis,
bearing the significant title of Nouveau~ EJrlt-etiens sur
les Sciences secretes. This volume elicited ready and wide
interest among thinkers in the eighteenth century, and it
may be briefly defined as a treatise opposing the philosophi·
cal theories of Descartes, or rather, opposing the popular
misapprehension and abuse of these.
Vintras, Eugene : A Norman peasant of great devoutness,
who in the year 1839 was fixed upoll by the Saviours of
Louis XVII. (q.v.), as a fitting successor to their prophet
Martin who had just died. They addressed a letter to
the pretended Louis XVII. and arranged that it should
fall into the hands of Vi11tras. 1t abounded in good
promises for the reign to come and in mystical expressions
calculated to inflame the brain of a person of weak and
excitable character such as Vintras was. In a letter
Vintras himself describes as follows the manner in which
this communication reached him:-
"Towards nine o'clock I was occupied in writing, when
there was a knock at the door of the room in which I sat,
and supposing that it was a workman who came on business,
I said rather brusquely, • Come in.' Much to my astonish·
ment, in place of the expected workman, I saw an old
man in rags. I asked merely what he wanted. He
answered with much tranquillity, • Don't disturb yourself,
Pierre "'lichel.' Now, these names are never used in
addressing me, for I am known everywhere as Eugene,
and even in signing documents I do not make use of my
first names. I was conscious of a certain emotion at the
old man's answer, and this increased when he ~aid : I am
utterly tired, and wherever I appear they treat me with
disdain, or as a thief.' The word:> alarmed me considerably,
though they were spoken in a saddened and even a woeful
tone. I arose and placed a ten sous piece in his hand, say·
ing, ' I do not take you for that, my good man,' and whlle
speaking I made him understand that I wished to see him
out. He received it in silence but turned his back with
a pained air. ~o sooner had he set foot on the last step
than I shut the door and locked it. I did not hear him
go down, so I called a workman and told him to come np
t<? my room. U.nder some busines~ pretext, I was wishing
htm to search w1th me all the poss1ble places which might
conceal my old man, whom I had not seen go out. The
workman came accordingly. I left the room in his com-
pany, again locking my door. I hunted through aU the
nooks and corners, but saw nothing.
" I was about to enter the factory when I heard on a
s~.~:dden th_e beU ringing for mass, and felt glad that, not·
w1thstandmg the disturbance, I could assist at the sacred
ceremony. I ran back to my room to obtain a prayer
book and, on the table where I had been writing, I found
a letter addressed to ).•
Ime. de Generlls in London ; it was
written and signed by M. Paul de Montfieury of Caen, and
embodied a refutation of heresy, together with a profession
of orthod?x faith. The address notwithstanding, this
letter was.mtended to place before the Duke o_f Normandy
the most 1mport~nt truths of our holy Cathohc, Apostolic
and Roman reltglOn. On the document was laid the
ten sous piece which I had given to the old man."
Vintras immediately concluded that the bringer of the
letter was a messenger from heaven, and became devoted
to the cause of Louis XVII. He became a Visionary. He
had bloody sweats, he saw hearts painted with his own
blood appear on hosts, accompanied by inscriptions in his
own spelling. Many believed him a prophet and followed
him, among them several priests, who alleged that they par·
took of his occult vision. Doctors•analysed the fluid which
flowed from the hosts and certified it to be human blood.
His enemies referred these miracles to the Devil. Vinlras'
followers regarded him as a new Christ. But one of them,
Gozzoli, published scandalous aceounts of his doings,
alleging that horrible obscenities and sacrilegious masses
took place in their private chapel at Tilly-sur-seules. The
unspeakable abominations alluded to are cont:>ined in a
pamphlet entitled Le Prophtle Vi11tras (1851). The sectwas
formally condemned by the Pope, and Vintras constituted
himself sovereign Pontiff. He was arrested on a charge of
exploiting his cult for money, was tried at Caen. and
sen~nced to five years' imprisonment. 'Vhen freed in
1845 he went to England. and in London resumed the
head-ship of his cult which seems to have flourished for
some time afterward,;.

Visions: (From Latin visus, p.p. of videre, to see.) The
appearance to mortals of supernatural persons, or scenes.
Of great frequency in early and medireval times, and among
savage or semi-civilised races, visions seem to have decreased
proportionately with the advance of learning and enlighten·
ment. Thus among the Greeks and Romans of the classic
period they were comparatively rare, though visions of
demons or gods were occasionally seen. On the other
hand, among Oriental races the seeing of vision.s was a
common occurrence, and these took more varied shapes.
In medireval Europe, again, visions were almost common·
places, and directions were given by the Church to enable
men to distinguish visions of divine origin from those false
delusions which were the work of the Evil One. Visions
may be roughly divided into two classes-those which are
spontaneous, and those which are induced. But, indeed,
the great majority belong to the latter class. Ennemoser
enumerates the causes of such appearances thus : (1)
Sensitive organism and delicate constitution~ (2} Religious
education and ascetic life (fasting, penance, etc.) ; (3)
Narcotics-opium, wine, incense, narcotic salves (witch·
salves) ; (4) Delirium, monomania; (5) Fear and expecta·
tion, preparatory words, songs, and prayers. Among the
visions induced by prayer and fasting, and the severe self·
discipline of the reUgious ascetic, must be included many
VIsions 424 Wafer
historical or traditional instances- the VlStons of St.
Francis of Assisi, St. Anthony, St. Bernard Ignatius, St.
Catherine of Siena, St. Hildegarde, Joan of Arc. It may
be noted that the convent has ever been the special haunt
of religious visions, probably for tbe reasons above men-
tioned. But the most potent mt:ans for the induc(ions of
visionary appearances are those made use of by tbe
Orientals. Narcotics of all kinds-opium, haschish, and
so on-are indulged in, and physical means used for this
express purpose. Thus the Brahmins will gaze for hours at
a time at the sun or moon, will remain for months in
practically the some pos1tion, or will practise all manner of
mortification of the body, so that they may fall at length
into tlte visionary sleep (a species of catalepsy.} The
narcotic salves with which they anoint themselves are said
to be similar to the witch-salves used in tbe Middle Ages,
which mducell in the witch the hallucination that she was
flying through the air on a goat or a broomstick. Opium
also is said to produce :\ sensation of flying, as well as
visions of cekstlal delight. Alcoholic intoxication induces
vis-ions of insects and small animals, as does also nitrogen.
The vapours rising from the ground in some places, or those
to be found in certain caverns. are said to exercise an effect
similar to that of narcotics. The Indians of North America
practise similar external methods of inducing visions--
solitude, fasting, and the use of salves or ointments. The
savages of Africa have dances which, by producing severe
dizziness, help them towards the desired visionary ecstasy.
The northern savages attain the same end by the use of
drums and noisy music. Spontaneous visions, though
less common, are yet sufficiently numerous to merit atten-
tion here. The difficulty is, of course, to lmow just how
far" fear and expectation " may have operated to induce
the visi011. In many cases, as in that of Swedenborg, the
visions may have commenced as ·• visions of tbe night,"
hardly to be distinguished from dreams. and so from vision
of an " internal " nature to clearly externalised apparitions.
s'"·edenborg himself declares that when seeing visions of the
latter class be- used his senses exactly as when awake,
dwelling with the spirits as a spirit, but l'l.ble to return to
his body when be pleased. An interesting case of spon·
taneous visio-n is that of Benvenuto Cellini (q.v.). Visions
are by no means confined to the sense of sight. Taste,
hearing, smelling, touch, may all be experienced in a
vision. Joan of Arc, for instance, heard voices encouraging
her to be the deliverer of her country. Examples may
be drawn from the Bible, as the case of the child Samuel in
the Temple, and instances could be multiplied from all
ages and all times. The visions of Pordage and the " Phila-
delphia Society,"-or, as they called themselves later, the
" Angelic Brethren "-in 1651 are noteworthy in this
respect because they include the taste of" brimstone. salt,
and soot." In the presence of the " Angelic Brethren "
pictures were drawn on the window-panes by invisible
hands, and were seen to move about.
Physiological exlpanations of visions have from time to
time been offered. Plato says : " The eye is the organ of a
fire which does not burn but gives a mild light. The rays
proceeding from the eye meet those of the outward light.
With the departure of the outward light the inner also
becomes less active ; all inward movements become calmer
and less disturbed ; and should any more prominent
influences have remained they become in various points
where they congregate. so many pictures of the fancy."
Democritus held that visions and dreams arc p:lssing shapes,
ideal forms proceeding from other beings. Of death-bed
Vision.s Plutarch says: " It is not probable that in death the
soul gains new powers which it was not before possessed ot
when tbe heart was confined within the chains of the body ;
but it is much more probable that these powers were always.
in being, though dimmed and clogged by the body ; and
the soul is only then able to practise them when the cor-
poreal bonds are loosened, and the drooping limbs and
stagnating juices no longer oppress it." The spiritualistic-
theory of 1:1s-ions can hardly be called a physiological one,
save in so far as spirit is regarded as refined matter. An
old theory of visionary ecstasy on these lines was that the
soul left the body and proceeded to celestial spheres, where
it remained in contemplation of divine scllnes and persons.
Very similar to this is the doctrine of Swcdenborg, whose
spirit, he believed, could commune with discarnate spirits
-the souls ofthe dead-as one of themselves. To this may
be directly traced the doctrines of modern spiritualism,
which thus regards visions as actual spirits or spirit scenes,
visible to the ecstatic or entranced subject whose spirit was
projected to discarnate planes. The question whether or
no visions arc contagious has been much disputed. It has
been said that such appearances may be transferred from
one person to another by the laying on o£ hands. In the
case of the Scottish seers such a transference may takeplace
even by accidental contact with the seer. The vision of the
second person is,howevcr,lessdistinct than that of theoriginal
seer. The same idea prevailed with regard to the visions of
magnetised patients. Jn so far as these may be identified
with the collective halluc;inations of the hypnotic state, there
is no definite scientific llvidence to prove their existence.
Visions have by no means been confined to the ignorant
or the superstitious. Many men of genius have been subject
to visionary appearanc,e. While Raphalll was trying to-
paint the Madonna she appeared to him in a vision. The
famous composition known as the " Devil's Sonata" was
dictated to Tartini by the Evil One himself. Goethe also-
had visions. Blake's portraits of tbe Patriarchs were done
from visionary beings w!Uch appeared to him in the night.
And such ill$tanccs might easily be multiplied.
Vitality, according to theosophtsts, comes from the sun.
'When a physical atom is transfused with viJality, it draws-
to itself six other atoms and thus makes an etheric element.
The sum of their vitality is tben divided among each of the
atoms and in this state the element enters the physical
body by means of one of the sense organs or challsams of
the etheric double-that situated opposite the spleen.
Here the element is divided into its component parts and
these are conveyed to the various parts of the physical
body. It is on vitality that the latter depends. not only
for life but for its well-being in life. A person sufficiently
supplied with it enjoys good health and one insufficiently
supplied is afflicted with poor health. {n the case of a.
healthy person, however, more vitality is drawn in than is
necessary for the vita! purposes and the superfluous
vitality acts beneficially on his neighbours, whether human
or animal, while it can also be directed in certain definite·
channels to the healing of diseases and so forth. With
unhealthy persons, the case is, of course, reversed, and
they devitalise the more healthy, with whom they come·
in contact.

Waldenses 425 War
Waldenses : The name of a Christian sect which arose in the
south of France about 1170. 'Ihey were much the same in
origin :lnd ethics as the A!bigenses (q.v.}, that is, their
religious system rested upon that of Manich.eism, which
believed in dualism and severe asceticism. It undoubtedly
arose from the desire of the bou):'geois class to have changes
J'l\ade in the clerical discipline of the Roman Church. Its
adherents caUed themselves calhan thus demonstrating the
eastern origin of theit syste.m. There were two classes of
these, cretkntes aud perjectt, or neophytes and adepts,-
the perfecti only being admitted to the esoteric doctrines
of the Waldensian Church. Outwardly its aim and effort
was rationalistic ; but the inn.er doctrine partook more
of the occult. It was in II70 that Peter Waldo, a rich
merchant of Lyons, sold his goods and gave them to the
poor, and from him the sect was named. The earliest
account of Waldensian beliefs is that of an enemy, Sacconi,
an inquisitor of the Holy Office, who wrote about the
middle of the thirteenth century. He divides the \"'al-
densians into two classes, those of Lombardy, and those
north of the Alps. The latter believed that any layman
might consecrate the sacrament of the altar, and that the
Roman Church was not the Church of Christ ; while the
Lombardiansect held that the Roman Church was the Scarlet
Woman of the Apocalypse. They also belie\'ed tltat all
men were priests. As their opinions became more wide-
spread, persecution became more severe, and the \"'alden-
sians latterly withdrew themselves altogether from the
Church of Rome, and chose ministers for themselves by
election. Papal bulls were issued for their extermination,
and a crusade was directed against them ; but they sur-
vived these attacks, and so late as the time of Cromwell
were protected by him against the Duke of Savoy and the
Frencl. king. Their ministers were later subsidised by the
government of Queen Anne, and this subsidy was carried on
until the time of Napoleon, when he granted them an
equivalent. Latterly they have received much assistance
from various Protestant countries of Europe, especially
from England; and at the present time number some
12,ooo to IJ,OOO communicants.
During the Middle Ages, it was strongly held by the
priesthood of the Roman Church that, like the Albigenses,
the \Valdensians had a diabolic element in their religion
and they have been from time to time classed with the
various secret societies that sprang up in medi.eval Europe,
such as the Knights Templar, the Rosicrucians, and so
forth ; but although they possessed an esoteric doctrine
of their own, there is no reason to believe that this was
in any way magicnl, nor in any manner more "esoteric"
than the inner doctrine of any other Christian sect.
Walder, Phileas : A Swiss, onginally a Lutheran minister,
a well-known occultist and spiritualist, and friend of
E!!phas Levi (q.v.). He is represented by· the ·pseudo-
historians of " Satanism " as a right-hand man of Albert
Pike (q.v.) in his alleged diabolic practices at Charleston,
U.S.A. (See Devil Worship.) In reality Walder was an
earnest mason and mystic.
Wallace, Alfred Russel : A distinguished British naturalist,
who discovered the theory of evolution independent of
Darwin. He was born at Usk, in Monmouthshire, on the
8th of January, 182]. His scientific studies included an
enqUiry into the phenomena of spiritualism, and he became
a firm believer in the genuinenes.~ of these manifestations.
Dr. Wallace had unique opportunities for studying these
in connection with Mrs. Guppy, who, as Miss Nichols,
lived for a time with his sister. Among his workS
was one entitled Miracles and Moden1 Spiritualism, pub-
lished in t88t. Dr. Wallace's views on psychic phenomena
remained unchanged until his death in 1903. His scientific
position made him a tower of strength to the spiritualists.

Wandering Jew, The : A medi~val German legend which
has several forms. Through various writers, and differing
in detail, the essential features of the narratives which have-
been handed down to us, are the same. The legend is that
as Christ was dragged on his way to Calvary, he passed
the hous<> of a Jew, and stopping there, sought to rest a
Little, being weary under the weight of his cross. The
Jew, however, inspired with the adverse enthusiasm of the
mob, drove Him on, and would not allow Him to rest
there. Jesus, looking at him, said, " I shall stand and
rest, but thou shalt go till the last day." Ever afterwards.
the Jew was compelled to wander over the earth, till this
prophecy should be fulfilled.
The legend of the Wandering Jew is to be regarded as the-
epic of the Semite people in the Middle Ages.
In some parts of Germany we find the Wantknng J~w
identified with the Wild Huntsman, whilst in several French
districts that mythical character is regarded as the wind of
the night. The blast in his horn, which, rushing through
the valteys creates a hollow booming sound not unlike a
great bugle. In this legend we have in all probability the
clue to the mythological side of the story of the wandering
jew. Or perhaps the idea of the Wandering jew has been
fused .with that of the conception of. the wind. The re-
semblance between the two conceptions would be too strong
to escape the popular mind. From a literary point of
view this legend has been treated by Eugene Sue and Croly.
wanneln Nat: An evil spirit. (See Burma.)
w ar, Occult Phenomena during the : A surprising number
of ideas regarding the supernatural have crystallized
around the circumstances of the war. Perhaps the most
striking of these was the alleged vision of angels at Mons.
The first notice regarding this, or at least the most impor-
tant and public record of the occurrence, was that con-
tained in the Evening News for September 14th, 1915, in:
\"'hich Mr. Machen described the evidence as given to him
by an officer who was in the retreat from Mons. This officer
was a member of a well-known army family and was a
person of great credibility, who stated that on August 26th,
J.9Iof, he was fighting in the battle of Le Gateau, from
which his division retired in good order. " On the night ot
the 27th," he says, " I was riding along the column with
two other officers.... As we rode along I became consciouS·
of the fact that in the fields on both sides of the road along
which we were marching I could see a very large bod:y· of
horsemen.... the other two officers had stopped talking.
At last one of them asked me if I saw anything in the
fields. I told them what I had seen. The third officer
confessed that he, too, had been watching these horsemen
for the past twenty minutes. So convinced were we that
they were really cavalry, that at the next halt one of the
officers took a party of men out to reconnoitre and found
no one there. The night then grew darker and we sa\or
no more."
Mr. Harold Beghie in his book On the Side of the Angels
states that a vision of angels was seen in the retreat from
Mons and gives the narrative of a solllier, who states that
an officer came up to him c. in a state of great anxiety "
and pointed out to him a c. strange light which seemed to-
be quite distinctly outlined and was not a reflection of the-
moon, nor were there any clouds in the neighbourhood.
The !ight became brighter and I coul~ see quite distinc~ly
three shapes, one in the centre haVIng what looked like-
outspread wings. The other two were not so large, but
were quite plainly disti'nct from the centre one. They
·appeared to have a long. loose-hanging garment of. a
golden tint and they were above the German line facing us.
\"'e stood watching them for about three-quarters of an
hour." All the men in the battalion who saw this with.
War 426
the exception of five were killed. i\Ir. Begbie goes on to
say that he was told by a nurse that a dying soldier spoke
to her of the reluctance of the Germans to attack our line,
" because of the thousands of troops behind us." Tlris
man had heard German prisoners say so and fully believed
in the phantasmal nature of those supporting hosts.
In his monograph on the Bowmen at Mons, Mr. Machen
put forward the idea that those seen before the retreat
from Mons were the spirits of the English bowmen who bad
fought at Agincourt and this idea gained wide prevalence,
an interesting monograph being written upon it by Mr.
Ralph Shirley. Men from the front, too, have stated to
interviewers that phantasms of the dead frequently
appeared in the space between the German and British
trenches called "No Man's Land."
Mr. Shirley has also written an excellent pamphlet on
" Prophecies and Omens of the Great War " dealing
with the various oracular utterances on the gigantic
struggle, which may be referred to with confidence.
Stories, too, were current in the earlier times of the war
regarding the appearance of saintly and protective figures
resembling the patrons of the several allied countries.
Thus the English were convinced that in certain engage-
ments they bad beheld the figure of Saint George mounted
on a white charger and the French were equally sure that
the figure in question was either Saint Denis or Joan of Arc.
Wounded men in base hospitals asked for medallions or
coins on which the likenesses of these saints were impressed
in order to verify the statements they made.
Wayland Smith : A famous character in German mythological
romance and father of Welticb, whom he trained in the
art of warfare and sent to the Court of Dietrich in Bern.
To him he gave the sword Miming and told him of a mer-
maid, his ancestress, to whom he was to apply when in
difficulty. He is also referred to in the Sigfried story,
being in company with a smith named Mimi, when Sig-
frlcd joins the smithy. His workmanship is praised in the
Beowulf Saga and be is mentioned there and elsewhere as a
maker of impregnable armour. Ile is the supernatural
smith of the Teutonic peoples, and is comparable to Vulcan
in Roman, and to Hephaistos in Greek mythology.

Werwolf: A man temporarily or permanently transformed
into a wolf, from the Anglo-Saxon wu, a man, and
wulj, a wolf. 1t is a phase of Lycanthropy (q.v.), and
in ancient and medi:Eval times was of very frequent
occurrence. It was, of course, in Europe where the wolf
was one of the largest carnivorous animals, that the super-
stition gained currency, similar tales in other countries
usually introducing bears, tigers, and so forth.
The belief is probably a relic of early cannibalism.
Communities of semi-civilised people would begin to shun
those who devoured human flesh, and they would be
ostracised and classed as wild beasts, the idea that they
had something in common with these would grow, and the
conception that they were able to transform themselves into
veritable animals would be likely to arise therefrom.
There were two kinds of werwolj, voluntary and involun-
tary. The voluntary would be, as has been said, those
persons who, because of their taste for human flesh, had
withdrawn from intercourse with their fellows. These
appeared to possess a certain amount of magical power, or at
least sufficient of it to transform themselves into the animal
shape at will. This they effected by merely disrobing, by
the taking off a girdle made of human skin, or, putting on
a similar belt of wolf-skin, obviously a sub!>'titutc for an
.entire wolf-slOn. But we also hear of their donning the
Werwolf
entrre skin. In other instances the body is rubbed with a
magic ointment, or water is drunk out of a wolf's foot-
print. The brains of the animal are also eaten. Claus
Magnus says " t.bat the werwolves of Livonia drained a
cup of beer on initiation, and repeated certain magic
words. In order to throw oil the woli shape the animal
girdle was removed, or else the magician merely muttered
a certain formula. In some instances the transformation
was supposed to be the work of Satan.
The superstition regarding werwolves seems to have been
exceedingly prevalent in France during the 16th century
as is evidenced by numerous trials, in some of which it is
clearly shown that murder and cannibalism took place.
Self-hallucination, too, was accountable for some of these
cases, the supposed werwolves fully admitting that they
had transformed themselves and had slain numerous
persons. But at the beginning of the 17th century,
commonsense came to the rescue, and persons making
such confessions were not credited. In Teutonic and
Slavonic countries it was complained by men of learning
that werwolves did more damage than the real criminals,
and a regular " college " or institution for the practice of
the art of n.nimal transformation was attributed to them.
Involuntary werwolves were often persons transformed
into an animal shape because o£ the commission of sin,
and condemned to pass so many years in that form. Thus
certain saints metamorphosed sinners into wolves. In
Armenia it is thought that sinful women arc condemned
to pass seven years in the form of a wolf. To such a woman
a demon appears, bringing a wolf-skin. He commands her
to don it, from which momtlnt she becomes a wolf with all
the nature of a wild beast, devouring her own children and
those of strangers. wandering forth at night, undeterred
by locks, bolts, or bars, returning only with morning to
resume her human form.
Romance, especially French romance, is full of wer-
wolves, and one of the most remarkable instances of this is
the Lay by Marie de France entitled BisclavereJ, the Lay of a
werwolf.
Many werwolves were innocent persons suffering through
the witchcraft of others. To regain their true form it was
necessary for them to kneel in one spot for a hundred years,
to lose three drops of blood, to be hailed as a werwolj, to
have the sign of the cross made on their bodies, to be
addressed thrice by their baptismal names, or to be struck
thrice on the forehead with a knife.
According to Donat de Hautemer, quoted by Goulart,
"there are some lycanthropes who are so dominated by
their melancholy humour that they really believe them-
selves to be transformed into wolves. This malady, accord-
ing to the testimony of Actius in his sixth book, chapter
XI., and Paulus in his third book, chapter XVI., and other
moderns, is a sort of melancholy, of a black and dismal
nature. Those who are attacked by it leave their homes
in the months of February, imitate wolves in almost
every particular, and wander all night long among the
cemeteries and sepulchres, so that one may observe a
marvellous change iu the mind and disposition, and,
above all in the depraved imagination, of the lycanthrope.
The memory, however, is stiirvigorous, as I have remarked
in one of this lycanthroplc melancholiacs whom we call
werwolues. For one who was well acquainted with me
was one day seized with his affiiction, and on meeting
him I withdr~w a little, fearing that he might injure me.
He, having glanced at me for a moment, passed on followed
by a crowd of :people. On his shoulder he carried the
entire leg and th1gh of a corpse. Having received careful
medical treatment, he was cured of this malady. On
meeting me on another occasion be asked me if I had not
been afraid when he met me at such and such a place•
WerwoU 427
which made me think that his memory was not burt by the
vehemence of his disease. though his imagination was so
greatly damaged."
" Guillaume de Brabant, in the narrative of Wier,
repeated by Goulart, has written in his History that a
certain man of sense and settled understanding was still
so tormented by the evil spirit that at a particular season
{)f the year he would think himself a ravening wolf, and
would run here and there in the woods. caves and deserts,
chasing little children. It was said that this man was
{)ften found running about in the deserts like a man out
of his senses, and that at last by the grace of God he came
to himself and was healed. There was also, as is related
by job Fincel in the second book On Miracles a villager
near Paule in the year 1541, who believed himself to be a
wolf, and assaulted several men in the fields, even killing
some. Taken at last, though not without .great difficulty,
he stoutly affirmed that he was a wol!, and that the only
way in which he differed from other wolves was that they
wore their hairy coats on the outside, w,hile he wore his
between his skin and his flesh. Certain persons, more
inhuman and wolfish than he, wished to test the truth of
this story. and gashed his arms and legs severely. Then,
learning their mistake, and the innocence I>f the melan·
<:holiac, they passed him over to the consideration of the
surgeons, in whose hands he died some days after. Those
affiicted with this disease are pale, with dark and haggard
eyes, seeing only with difficulty ; the tongue is dry, and
the sufferer very thirsty. Pliny and others write that the
brain of a bear excites such bestial imaginations. It is
even said that one was given to a Spanish gentleman to
eat in our times, which so disturbed his mind, that imagin-
ing himself to be transformed into a bear, he fled to the
mountains and deserts."
" .As !or the lycanthropes, whose imagination was so
damaged," says Goulart, "that by some Satanic efficacy
they appeared wolves and not men to those who sa... them
running about and doing aU manner of harm, Bodin main-
tains that the devil can change the shape of one body
into that of another, in the great ~wer that God gives
him in this elementary world. He says, then, that there
may be lycanthropes who have really been transformed
into wolves, quoting various examples and histories to
prove his contention. In short, after many disputes, he
believes in Colt's forms of lycanthropy. And as for the
latter, there is represented at the end of this chapter the
summary of his proposition, to wit, that men are some-
times transformed into beasts, retaining in that form the
human reason ; it may be that this comes about by the
direct power of God, or it may be that he gives this power
to Satan, who carries out his will, or rather his redoubtable
judgments. And if we confess (he says) the truths of the
sacred history in Dimiel, concerning the transformation
of Nebuchadnezzar, and the history of Lot's wife changed
into motionless stone, the changing of men into an ox or
a stone is certainly possible ; and consequently the trans-
formation to other animals as well."
G. Peucer says in speaking of lycanthropy : " As for
me I had formerly regarded as ridiculous and fabulous the
stories I had often heard concerning the transformation
of men into wolves ; but I have learnt from reliable
sources, and from the testimony of trustworthy witnesses,
t hat such things are not at all doubtful or incredible,
since they tell of such transformations taking place twelve
days after Christmas in Livonia and the adjacent coun-
tries ; as they have been proved to be true by the con-
fessions of those who have been imprisoned and tortured
for such crimes. Here is the manner in which it is done.
Immediately after Christmas day is past, a lame boy
goes round the country calling. these slaves of the devil,
Werwolr
of which there are a great number, and enjoining them
to follo\v him. If they procrastinate or go too slowly,
there immediately appears a tall man with a whip whose
thongs are made of iron chains, with which he urges them
onwards, and sometimes lashes the poor wretches so
cruelly, that the marks of the whip remain on their bodies
till long afterwards, and cause them the greatest pain.
As soon as they have set out on their road, they are all
changed into wolves..... They travel in thousands, having
for their conductor the bearer of the whip, after whom
they march. When they reach the fields, they rush upon
the cattle they find there, tearing and carrying away
all they can, and doing much other damage ; but they are
not permitted to touch or wound persons. When they
approach any rivers, their guide separates the waters with
his whip, so that they seem to open up and leave a dry
space by which to cross. At the end of twelve days the.
whole band scatters, and everyone returns to his home,
having regained his own proper form. This transformation,
they say, comes about in this wise. The victims fall
suddenly on the ground as though they were taken with
sudden illness, and remain motionless and extended like
corpses, deprived of all feeling, for they neither stir, nor
move from one place to another, nor are in any wise trans-
formed into wolves, thus resembling carrion, for although
they are rolled or shaken, they give no sign of life."
Bodin relates several cases of lycanthropy and of men
changed into beasts.
" Pierre Mamot, in a little tre.•tise he has written on
sorcerers, says that he has observed this changing of
men into wolves, he being in Savoy at the time. Henry
of Cologne in his treatise de Lamiis regards the trans-
formation as beyond doubt. And Ulrich in a little book
dedicated to the emperor Sigismund, writes of the dispute
before the emperor, and says that it was agreed, both on
the ground of reason, and of the experience of innumerable
examples, that such transformation was a fact ; and he
adds that he himself had seen a lycanthrope at Constance,
who was accused, convicted, condemned, and finally
executed after his confession. And several books pub-
lished in Germany say that one of the greatest kings of
Christendom, who is not long dead, and who had the
reputation of being one of the r-eatest sorcerers in the
world, often changed into a woii.'
" I remember that the attorney-general of the King,
Bourdin, bas narrated to me another which was sent to
him from the Low Countries, with the whole trial signed
by the judge and the clerks, of a wolf, which was struck
by an arrow on the thigh, and afterwards found himself
in bed, with the arrow (which he had torn out), on regain-
ing his human shape, and the arrow was recognised by him
who had fired it~the time and place testified by the con-
fession of the person."
" Garnier, tried and condemned by the parliament of
Dole, being in the shape of a we,wotf, caught a girl of
ten or twelve years in a vineyard of Chastcnoy, a quarter
of a league from D~e. and having slain her with his teeth
and claw-like hands, he ate part of her flesh and carried
the rest to his wife. A month later, in the same form, he
took another girl, and would have eaten her also, had he
not, as he himsel£ confossed, been prevented by three
persons wlio happened to be passing by ; and a fortnight
after he strangled a boy of ten in the vineyard of Gredisans,
and ate his flesh ; and in the form of a man and not of a
wolf, he killed another boy of twelve or thirteen years in a
wood of the village of Porouse with the intention of eating
him, but was again prevented. He was condemned to be
burnt, and the sentence was executed."
.. At the parliament of Bezanc;on, the accused were
Pierre Burgot and Mkhel Verdun, who confessed to having
Werwolf 428
renounced God and sworn to serve the devil. And Michel
Verdun led Burgot to the bord du Chaste! Charlon where
everyone carried a candle of green wax which shone with
a blue flame. There they d:lnced and offered sacrifices
to the devil. Then after being anointed they were turned
into wolves, running with incredible swiftness; then they
were changed again into men, and suddenly transformed
back to wolves, when they enjoyed the society of female
woh·es as much as they had done that of their wives.
They confessed also that Burgot had killed a boy of seven
years with his wolf-claws and teeth, intending to eat
him, but the peasants gave chase. and prevented him.
Burgot and Verdun had eaten four girls between them ; and
they had caused people to die by the touch of a certain
powder."
" Job Finccl, in the eleventh book of his i\.!arvels wrote
that there was at Padua a lycanthrope who was caught
and his wolf-claws cut, and at the same instant he foun·d
his arms and feet cut. That is given to strengthen the
case against the sorcerers of Vernon (1556) who assembled
themselves in an old and ruined chateau under the shape
of an infinite number of cats. There happened to arrive
there one evening four or five men. who decided to spend
the night in the place. They were awakened by a multi-
tude of cats, who assaulted them. killed one of thetr number,
and wounded others. The men, however, succeeded in
wounding several of the cats, who found on recovering
their human shape that they were badly hurt. And in-
credible as it may seem, the trial was not proceeded
\Vith."
" But the five inquisitors who had experimented in
these causes have left it in writing that there were three
sorcerers in Strasbourg who, in the guise of three large
cats, assaulted a labourer. and in defending himself he
wounded and dispersed the cats, who found themselves,
at the same moment, laid on sick-beds, in the form cf
women severely wounded. At the trial they accused him
who had struck them, and he told the judges the hour and
the place where he had been assaulted by the cats, and
how he had wounded them." (See Lycanthropy.)
West Indian Islands: Magic and sorcery in the West Indian
Islands are wholly the preserve of the negro population, who
possess special magical cults called Obeah and Vaudoux,
variants of V.'est African fetishism. The root idea of
Obeahism and Vaudoux is the worship and propitiation of,
the snake-god Obi-a West African word typifying the
St>irit of Evil. Vaudoux or Voodoo is a form of
Obeah practised in Hayti, San Domingo, and the French
West Indies. Its rites are always .accompanied by the
sacrifice of fowls and goats, and in only too many cases by
the offering up of the ·• goat without horns "-the hu~an
sacrifice, usually a young girl or boy. The lonely groves
and mountain caves where the devotees of Vaudoux enjoy
the orgies of a Walpurgis night seldom give up their secrets.
There are two sects of Vaudoux-the white and the red.
The former, which only believes in the sacrifice of white
fowls and goats, is tolerated by the laws of Hayti, and its
rites are as commonly practised as those of the Catholic
Church. But even the red sect, which openly stands for
human sacrifice, is seldom interfered with. The authorities
dare not suppress it. for their own policemen and soldiers
stand in awe of the " Papaloi," and •· Mamaloi "-the
priests and priestess of the snake-god. More than that,
there have been Presidents of Hayti in recent years who
believed in Vaudoux. Hippolyte was even a •· Papal"i"
himself. He beat the black goatskin drum in the streets of
the capital to call the faithful together to see him kill
the sen-sel fowl. Another president, Geffard, tried to do
his duty and stamp out the cult. A terrible revenge was
taken upon him. His young daughter, Cora, was shot
West Indian Islands
dead as she knelt io prayer before the altar of a church in
Port-au-Prince. To-day there is a temple of the red sect
in the Haytian capital near a triumphal arch, which is
inscribed with the unctuous words,·· Liberty-education-
progress." Under British government Ol:>eahism perforce
takes forms less dangerous to the social order than it does
in Hayti ; but it is none the less a constant public peril in
Jamaica and the other British West Indian Islands. It is
a bitter foe of religion, education and social advancement
In olden days it worked by means of wholesale poisoning,
and in quite recent days there have been not a few case.<; of
Obeahmen seeking to do murder in the old way. A
favourite method of the Obeahmen, both in Jamaica and
Hayti, is to mix the infinitesimal hairs of the bamboo in
the food of persons who refuse to bow the knee to them.
This finally sets up malignant dysentery. If the afflicted
one remains contumacious, he dies ; if he makes his peace
with the Obeahman, and gives him a handsome present, the
slow process of poisoning ceases. and he lives. In all the
crises and troubles of life the negro fties to the Obeahman.
If he has to appear at the Police Court he pays the Obeah-
man to go there also and ·· fix de eye " of the magistrate,
so that he will be discharged. Perhaps he has been turned
out of his office o! deacon in the Baptist Chapel by a white
minister for immorality. ln that case the Obeahman will
arrange for a choice collection of the most powerful spells-
such as dried lizards, fowls' bones, and graveyard earth-
to be placed in the minister's Bible for him to stare upon
when he looks up the text of his sermon. Then, if the
Obeah works properly, the erring deacon will be received
back to office. Even coloured men of education and
official position are often tainted with Obeahisrn. They
often make use of it for profit and to increase their power
over the ignorant negroes. The mulatto chairman of a
Parochial Board-the Jamaican equivalent o[ our County
Council-was ~ent to goal for practising Obeah only a few
years ago. A prominent member of the Kingston City
Council was the leading Obcahman in the island- the
pontiff of the cult. He was so clever that the police could
never catch him, although he was supposed to make over
[3,000 a year by his nefarious practices. Once some
detectives raided his place, but he received timely warning
and fied.
A writer to the press thus describes a " red" Vaudoux
ceremony : " I had seen the · white · ritual several times
in Port-au-Prince and elsewhere when at last I was per-
mitted through the kindness of a mulatto general, to
witness the ' red ' rite. I was informed that only cocks
and goats would be sacrificed, and that turned out to be
the fact. The General conducted me to a small wood about
three miles from the town of Jacmel. By the light of
kerosene oil flares I saw about forty men and women
gathered round a rude stone altar, on which, twined
around a cocomacacque stick, was the sacred green snake.
The · Mamaloi,' a tall, evil-looking negress, was dressed
in a scarlet robe, with a red turban on ,her head. She was
dancing a sinuous dance before the altar, and droning an
ancient West African chant. which the onlookers repeated.
Rapidly she worked herself up to a frantic pitch of excite-
ment, pausing noyr and then to take a drink from one of the
rum bottles which passed freely from hand to hand. At
last she picked up a glittering machete from the altar, and
with her other hand seized a black cock held by a bystander.
She whlrled the bird round her head violently until the
feathers were flying in all directions, aud then severed the
head from the body with one swift stroke. The tense and
horrible excitement bad kept the worshippers silent, but
they burst into a savage yell when the priestess pressed the
bleeding neck of the slaughtered fowl to her lips. After-
wards she dipped her finger in the blood and made the
West Indian Islands 429 Westear Papyrus
sign of the cross on her forehead and pressed it to the
forehead of some of her disciples."
The obeah man can always be easily recognised by one
who has had much to do With negroes. He has an indes-
cribably sinister appearance. He is unwashed, ragged,
often half mad, usually diseased, and almost always has an
ulcerated leg. This last, indeed, is a badge of the tribe.
Often he is a very old negro who knew " slavery days"
and more than half believes ill his magical pretensions.
But not all are of this disreputable t}rl>e. Even some of
the white planters themselves do not scorn to make use of
obeah, although, of course, they have no belief in it. The
theft of growing crops by the negroes is one of the greatest
trials of their lives. Sometimes they adorn the trees
ro~~d the edge of a " banana piece " or orange grove with
mtmature coffi!ls, old bones, bottles of dirty water, and
other obeah obJects ; and then the negroes will r.ot d:ue to
enter and steal. An interesting report published in a
Jamaican journal during 1908 gives particulars of an obeah
case of possession or haunting as follows :
" The cause celebre at Half-way Tree Court, Jamaica,
recently, was the case of Rex v. Charles Donaldson for
unlawfully practising obeah. Robert Robinson, who
stated that he was a labourer living at Trench Pen, in the
parish of St. Andrew, stated that on Tuesday, the 8th
ult., he was sitting down outside the May Pen cemetery
on the Sp:~.nish To~n Road. H~ w~s on his way from
work, and had a white handkerchief tled around his head.
He was feeling sick, and that led him to sit down. While
there sitting the prisoner came to him. He did not know
the man before, but he began by asking him what was the
matter. Vlitn!lsS replied, " I am well sick." The
prisoner said, ·• No, you arc not sick; you have two ghosts
on you--one creole and one coolie." Witness told the
prisoner to go away and was left. He next saw prisoner
on Wednesday 9th. He came to him at Bumper Hall,
where he was working, and he said to him, " ~Ian, how
you find me here ? •· ·• Oh," replied the prisoner, "if a
man is in hell self I can find him ; I come for you to give me
the job ? " Witness then inquired, " \Vhat job ?" and
accused told him he wanted to " take off the two ghosts."
He would do it for £-zs, and he" killed " for any sum from
f.25 to f.so. He had worked for all classes-white, black,
coolie, Chinese, etc. Witness said he did not give him any
" good consent" at the time, but reported the matter
after the accused left to Clark and Wright, two witnesses in
the case. Clark told him he must not scare the man but go
home. On Thursday, the roth, the defendant came to
him at his yard at French Peu. The accused told him he
would come back to him to take off the ghost. He also
told him to get a bottle of rum and ss. He (witness) con-
seitted to the arrangement. The defendant began by
taking off his jacket. He then opened his " brief bag "
.and took out a piece of chalk. The accused then made
three marks on the table and took out a phial and a white
s_tone. _Th~ phial contained so":le stuff which appeared
hke qlllckstlver. He arrayed h1s paraphernalia on the
table. They consisted of a large whisky bottle with some
y_ellow stuff,_ a candle, a pack of cards, a looking-glass, three
c1garette pictures, a pocket knife, etc. The accused
also took out a whistle which he sounded, and then placed
the earns on the table. He then asked for the ss. which
was given to him. He placed the coins on the cards around
a lighted candle. The pint of rum which he (witness) had
brought was on the table and prisoner poured some of it into
a pan. He went outside and sprinkled the rum at •he
four corners of the house. Accused came back in and
said, " Papa ! papa I your case is very bad I There are
two ghosts outside. The creole is bad, but the coolie is
rather worse. But if he is made out of hell I will catch him."
The prisoner then began to blow his whistle in a very funny
way-a way in which he had never heard a whistle blown
before. He also began to speak in an unknown tongue and
to call up the ghosts.
::\{r. Lake- " Aren't there a lot of you people who believe
that ghosts can harm and molest you ? "
'Witness-" No, I am not one."
Mr. Lake-" Did you not tell him that a duppy struck
you on your back and you heard voices calling you ?"
Witness--'' He told me so." Continuing, witness said
he had seen all sorts of ghosts at·all different times and of
different kinds also.
Mr. Lake-" Of all different sexes, man and woman ? "
Witness--" Yes; any man who can see ghosts will know
a man ~host from a woman ghost. Dcm never walk
straight. '
Westear Papyrus : An Egyptian papyrus dating from the
eighteenth century B.C., devoted chiefly to tales of magic
and enchantment. The commencement and ending arc
wanting, yet enough of the subject matter has survived to
enable us to form a fairly correct idea of the whole. \Viede-
mann says concerning it (Popular Literature in Ancient
Egypt) : " The papyrus tells how Kheops-the king wliom
notices of Greek writerS have made universally famous as
the builder of the Great Pyramid of Gizeh-commands
stories of magic to be told to him. The first of these, of
which the conclusion only remains, is supposed to have
occurred in t9e reign of King T'eser of the Third Dynasty.
The next, which is complete, belongs to the reign of Neblea.,
a somewhat earlier king. In those days it came to the ears
of a great nobleman that his faithless wife was in the habit
of meeting her lover by the side of a lake. Being skilled
in magic he mo.dclled a crocodile in wax and ordered one of
his servants to cast it into the water. It was immediately
transformed into a real crocodile and devoured the lover.
Seven days later the king was walking by the lake with his
friend the nobleman, when at the command of the latter
the crocodile came to the shore and laid its victim at their
feet. The king shuddered at the sight of the monster
but at the touch of its maker it became once more a mere
figure of wax. T hen the wbole astonishing story was told
to the king, who thereupon granted the crocodile per-
mission to take away that which was its own. The creature
plunged into the depths of the lake and disappeared with
the adulterer. while the guilty wife was burnt to death and
her ashes were scattered in the stream.
A tale of enchantment follows, the scene of which is
laid during the reign of King Sneferu, the predecessor of
Kheops. The king was one day takin~ his pleasure on a
lake in a boat rowed by twenty beautiful maidens, when
one of the girls dropped a malachite ornament into the
water. The king promised to give her another in its
stead, but this did not content her, for she wanted her own
jewel and no other. A magician was summoned who
repeated a spell by the might of which he piled one half of
the lake on th<' top of the other, so that the water, which
at first was twelve ells deep in the middle of the Lake, no,.,
stood twenty-four ells high. The jewel, found lying in
the mud in the dry portion of the lake, was restored to its
owner ; and the magician having once more mumbled his
spell the water returned to its former place.
When Kheops had listened for some time with much
interest to the accounts of the strange events that had
transpired in the days of his predecessors, then stepped
forward Prince Horduduf, who is really known to us from
the song in the tomb-temple of King Ante£ as renowned
for his wisdom. He told the king that all man·els were not
thin~ of the past but that even then there was •n-ing a
magtcian named Deda, who was one hundred and ten years
Westcar Papyrus 430 Williams, Charles
old, and consumed every day five hundred loaves, a side of
beef. and a hundred jars of beer.
Kbeops was so much interested that he sent the prince
to escort the magician to his presence. Deda obeyed the
royal summons and performed his chief feat before the king.
This consisted in decapitating a goose, a duck, and an ox,
and charming the beads back again on to the bodies so that
the creatures lived and breathed as before. Kbeops fell
into talk with the magician, who told him that the wife of
a priest in Sakhebu was awaiting the birth of three sons,
ch•ldren of the god Ra, who should one day sit on the
throne of Egypt. Deda sought to allay the king's natural
distress at this information by prophesying that only
after the reigns of his son and grandson should the power
fall into the bands of the desc;;ndants of the Sun-god. But
Kheops was not to be consoled ; he inquired into the
details of the story and announced that he would himself
travel to Sakhebu, no doubt with.the ultimate intention of
finding an opportunity to put out of the way the pretenders
to his throne.
The scene of the sequel is laid in Sakhebu. The birth
a.nd infancy of the three children are described in detail,
and all sorts of marvellous incidents are represented as
influencing their fate. The gods cared for the safety of the
little ones. A maid to whom the secret was known being
enraged by a severe punishment inflicted upon her,
threatened to betray all to Kheops. Her own brother
beat her, and when she went down to the water she was
c.'lrricd off by a crocodile. Here the papyrus ceases, but it
is possible to a certain extent to restore the conclusion.
The names of the three children of Ra show that they
stand for the first three kings Qf the Fifth Dynasty, the
family that followed the bouse of Kheops. The papyrus
must therefore have told how the boys escaped all the
snares bid for their lives and in due time ascended the
throne for which they were destined."

Wild-Women: A species of nature spirits believed in by the
German peasantry. Says Keigbtley concerning them:
" The Wilde F1'auen or Wild-women of Germany bear a
very strong resemblance to the Ellc-maids of Scandinavia.
Like tliem they are beautiful, have fine flowing hair, live
within hills, and only appear singly or in the society of
each other. They partake of the piety of character we
find among the German Dwarfs.
·· The celebrated Wundcrberg, or Underberg, on the
great moor ncar Salzburg, is the chief haunt of t he Wild-
womm. The Wundcrberg is said to be quite hollow, and
supplied with stately palaces, churches, monasteries,
gardens, and springs of gold and silver. Its itthabitants,
besides t he Wild-women, are little men, who have charge
of the treasures it contains, and who at midnight repair
to Salzburg to perform their devotions in the cathedral ;
giants, who used to come to the church of Grodich and
exhort the people to lead a godly and pious life ; and
the great emperor Charles V., with golden crown and
sceptre, attended by knights and lords. His grey beard
has twice encompassed the table at which he sits, and
when it has the third time grown round it, the end of the
world and the appearance of the Antichrist will take place.
·• The following is the only account we have of the
Wild-u:omuz.
" The inhabitants of the village of Grodicb and the
peasantry of the neighbourhood assert that frequently,
about the year r753, the Wild-u'Omen used to come out of
the Wunderburg to the boys and girls that were keeping
the cattle near the hole within Glanegg, and give them
bread to eat.
" The Wild-women used frequently to come to where
the people were reaping. They c.•me down eagerly in the
morning, and in the evening, when the people left off
work, they went back into the "'underburg without
partaking of the supper.
" It once fell out ncar this hill, that a little boy was
sitting on a horse which his father had tethered on the
headland of the field. Then came the Wild-women out
of the hill and wanted to take away the boy by force.
But the father, who was well acquainted with the secrets
of this bill. and what used to occur there, without any
dread hasted up to the women and took the boy from them,
with these words : • \'Vhat makes you presume to come so
often out of the hill, and now to take away my child with
you ? What do you want to do with him ? ' The Wild-
women answered : • He will be better with us, and have
better care taken of him than at home. We shall be very
fond of the boy, and he will meet with no injury' But the
father would not let the boy out of his hands, and the
Wild-women went away weeping bitterly.
" One time the Wild-women came out of the Wundcrberg,
near the place called the Ku~el-roill, which is prettily
situated on the side of this hlll, and took away a boy
who was keeping cattle. This boy, whom every one knew,
was seen about a year after by some wood-cutters, in a
gteen dress, and sitting on a rock of this bill. Next
day they took his parents with them, intending to search
the bill for him, but they all went about it to no purpose,
for the boy never appeared any more."
Will is in theology, one of the aspects of the triplicity, of the
Logos, and hence since the Monad is essentially a part o!
the Logos, it is also an a.Spect of the Monad, taken on when
the latter commences his descent into matter by entering
the Spiritual World and appearing as Spirit. ·
WUUam Rufus : Son of William the Conqueror, and tyrant
of England in the eleventh century ; a wicked and cruel
prince. He was much disliked, particularly by the priests
and monks, whom he reduced to the extremest poverty.
One day when he was out bunting (in the year 1100, the
forty-fourth year of his life, the thirtieth of his reign) he
was killed by an arrow launched by an invisible hand.
Wb.ile he was drawing his last breath the comte de Comon-
ailles, who had been separated from the hunt, saw a shaggy
black goat carrying off a mangled human form, pierced by
an arrow. The comte cried aloud to the goat to halt, and
asked who he was, and where he was going. The goat
responded that he was the devil, and was carrying off
W•lliam Rufus, to present him before the great tribunal,
where he would be condemned for his tyranny and forced
to accompany him (the devil) to his abode.
Williams, Charles ; An English medium who began to
practice about t87o. In r87t he went into pa1tnership
with the medium Herne. During the earlier years of their
mediumship Mrs. Cuppy, herself a well-known medium,
was their patroness. The phenomena then produced were
not of a very ambitous character, but consisted of lights,
apports, movements of the furniture without contact.
spirit voices, and the appr..a.rance of fiery letters in the air.
One of the most curious feats of these early seances was
the transit of Mrs. Guppy. (See Levitation.) Soon
afterwards materialisation was attempted by Messrs. Herne
and Willia1HS, in emulation of the feats of Miss Florence
Cook, who had been a sitter at their early seances. In
1878 Williams'swas the mediumship chosen for investigation
Willow-Tree 431 WJt.cherart
by t1le Research Committee o! the British National Associa-
tion o! Spiritualists (q. v.). Notwithstanding the favourable
report of the Committee, Williams'$ mediumship was not
destined to last much longer. In company with a new
partner, Rita, he had gone to Amsterdam, and there were
found in their possession false beards, spirit draperies, and
phosphorised oLI. The exposure was entirely carried out
and given to the public by mdignant spiritualists.
WiDow-tree: The Wiliow, as might be expected, had many
superstitious notions connected with it, since, accorriing to
the authorized version of the English Bible, thc Israelites
are said to have hung their harps on willow trees. The
'l.veeping willow is said to have, ever since the time of the
Jews' captivity in Babylon, drooped its branches, in
sympathy with this circumstance. The common willow
was held to be under the protection of the devil, and it was
said that, if any were to cast a knot upon a young willow,
and sit under it, and thereupon renounce his or her baptism,
the devil would confer upon them supernatural power.
Windsor Castle : Windsor Castle is said to be the haunt of
numerous spectres. Queen Elizabeth, Henry VIII.,
Charles 1., and some of the Georges have all been reputed to
haunt the Castle, while Herne the Hunter (q.v.) is also
said to roam the Great !'ark. An officer of the Foot
Guards, while on duty, was once sitting zu the library
reading in the gloaming when he declares he heard a rustle
of silken dress, and, looking up, saw the ghost o! Queen
Elizabeth glide across the room. He buckled on his
sword, and reported the matter. The story attracted the
attention of the country for some weeks. Sir Richard
Holmes and his assistants kept watch for many nights, but
the ghost did not re-appear. Not long ago a housemaid
in St. John's Tower thought she saw a ghost, and was so
frightened that she became ill, and had to be sent horne.
In 1908 a sentry discharged five rounds of ball cartridge
at a figure which he declared was a spectre which appeared
on the terrace.

Wlrdlg's Magnetic Sympathy : The doctrine of magnetic
attraction and repugnance formulated by Tenzel Wirdig,
professor at Rostock, who published his Tenzeliz4S Wirdig,
Nova tnedicina spiriluum in 1673. Wirdig believed that
everything in the universe possessed a soul, and that the
earth- itself was merely a larger anima1. Between the
souls of things in accordance wilh each other there was a
magnetic sympathy and a perpetual antipathy between
those of an uncongenial nature. To this sympathy and
antipathy Wirdig gave the name of magnetism. He says :
'· Out o! this relationship of sympathy and antipathy arises
a constant movement in the whole world, and in all its
parts, and an uninterrupted communion between heaven
and earth, which produces universal harmony. The stars
whose emanations consist merely of fire and spirits, have
an undeniable influence on earthly bodies ; and their
influence on man demonstrates itself by life, movement,
and warmth, those things without which he cannot live.
The influence of the stars is the strongest at birth. The
new-born child inhales this influence, and on whose first
breath frequently his whole constitution depends, nay,
even his whole life."
Wlseonsin Phalanx : A spiritualistic commumty founded by
Warren Chase in t844. Chase had settled in Sout hport,
Wisconsin, in 1838, and there, with his wife and child, he
lived for a time in the deepest poverty. At length, however,
their circumstances brightened, and Chase attained to a
position of civic honour in Southport. Meanwhile he had
studied mesmerism and socialism with the aid of a few
periodicals-Laroy Sunderland's Magnet and the New
Yotk Tribune-and was filled with the idea of founding a
community where his ideals of social order and harmony
might be carried out. With the aid of his friends such a
community was formed, each member with a share of
twenty-five dollars. The chosen settlement-near the
town of Ripon-was christened Ceresco, in honour of Ceres.
For six years the TViscou.si11 Phalanx flourished, having
as its leader and ruling spirit Warren Chase himself. But
at last dissensions arose, and in 1850 it was dissolved.
\~en its affairs were wound up it was found that a con-
siderable profit fell to the share of its members. I n all, it
was one of the most successful spiritualistic or socialistic
communities of the time.
Wisdom Religion : (See Theosophy.)
Witchcraft : (From Saxen Wicca, a contraction of wifega,
a prophet or sorcerer.) The cult of persons who, by means
of satanic assistance or the aid of evil spirits or familiars,
are enabled to practise minor black magic. But the
difference between the sorcerer and the witch is that the
former has sold his so~1l to Satan !or complete dominion
over him for a stated period, whereas the witch usually
appears as the devoted and often badly treated servant of
the diabolic power. But she is often mistress of a familiar,
her bounden slave, and among certain savage peoples her
occult powers nrc self-evolved. The concept Of witchcraft
was perhaps brought into being by the mythic influence of
conquered races. It closely resembles in ritual and practice
the demonism of savage races, from which it probably
sprang. (See Devil Worship.) That is, the non-Aryan
peoples of Europe who precc(,lcd the Aryan population,
carrying on the practice and traditions of their religions
more or less in secret, awoke in the Aryan mind the idea
that such practices were of a" magical " character. This
idea they would not fail to assist, and would probably
exaggerate such details as most strongly impressed the
Aryan mind, to which their gods would appear as " devils,"
and their religious ritual as sorcery. This view has been
combatted on the ground that the gap betwixt, say, the
extinction of the pre-Aryan religion known as Druidism
and the first notices of witchcraft, is too great to bridge.
But Druidism continued to exist long after it was officially
extinct, and British witchcrajl is its lineal successor. The
theory is further advanced that on the failure of the non-
Aryan priesthood novices would be adopted from the
invading race !or the purpose of carr}•ing on the old religion.
It seems to the present writer that the circumstance that
the greater number of the upholders o£ this ancient tradition
were women points to the likelihood of an early custom of
t he adoption or marriage of Aryan women by a non-Aryan
people who would prefer to recruit their novices and
devotees from the more plastic sex, naturally distrusting
the masculine portion o! an alien people to fall in with
their religious ideas, and that the almost exclusive employ-
ment of women in the cult (in Britain, at least) originated
in this practice. Then individually all claimed to have
been initiated. Says Gomme, " I am inclined to lay great
st'l'ess upon the act of initiation. It emphasises the idea
of a caste distinct from the general populace, and it postu-
lates the existence of this caste anterior to the time when
those who practice their supposed powers first come into
notice. Carrying back this' act o! initiation age after age,
as the dismal records of witchcraft enable us to do for
some centuries, it is clear that the people from time to
time thus introduced into the witch caste carried on the
practices and assumed the functions o! the caste even
though they came to it as novices and strangers. \V~ thus
arrive at an artificial means of descent of a peculiar group
of superstition, and it might be termed initiatory descent."
This concept, thinks Gomme (Folklore as an Histori.cal
Science, p. 201 at seq.) was inftucnced in the !'.fiddle Ages
by another.
" Traditional practices, traditional formul~. and traditional
Witchcraft 432
beliefs arc no doubt the clements of witchtYajt, but it was
not the force of tradition which produced the miserable
doings of the Middle Ages, and of the seventeenth century
against witches. These were due to a psychological force,
partly generated by the newly acquired power of the people
to read the Bible for themselves, and so to apply the witch
stories of the Jews to neighbours of their own who possessed
powers or peculiarities which they could not understand,
and partly generated by the C?.Trying on of traditional
practices by certain families or groups of persons v.·ho could
only acquire knowledge of such practices by initiation or
family teaching. Lawyers, magistrates, judges, nobles
and monarchs are concerned with witchcraf:. These are
not minds that have been crushed by civilisation, but
minds which have misunderstood it or misused it."
Sabbatli.-Thc media!Val criminal records abound in
descriptions of a ceremony at which the rites of the witch
cult were periodically celebrated. This was the v.-itches'
Sabbath. The Sabbllth was generally held in some wild
and solitary spot. often in the midst of forests or on the
heights of mountains, at a great distance from the residence
of most of the visitors. The Circumstance connected
with it most difficult of proof was the method of transport
lrom one place to another. The witches nearly all agreed
in the statement that they divested themselves of their
clothes and anointed their bodies with an ointment made
for that especial purpose. They then strode across a
stick, or any similar article, and, muttering a charm, were
carried through the R.ir to the place of meeting in an incred-
ibly short space of time. Sometimes the !;tick was to be
R.nointed as well as their persons. They generally left
the house by the window or by the chimr.ey, which perhaps
suggests survival of the custom of an earth-dwelling
people. Sometimes the witch went out by the door,
and there found a demon in the shape of a goat, or at
times of some other animal, who earned her away on his
back. and brought her horne again after the rneeting was
dissolved. Tn the confes~ions extorted from them at
their trials, the witches and sorcerers bore testimony to
the truth of all these p2rticulars; but those who judged
them, and who wrote upon the subject, asserted that they
had many other independent proofs in corroboration.
We ue told by Bodin that a man who lived at the little
town of Loches having observed that his wife frequently
absented herself from the house in the night, became
suspicious of her conduct. and at last by his threats obliged
her to confess that she was a witch, lind that she attended
the Sabbaths. To appease the anger tJf her. husband, she
agreed to gratify his curiosity by taking him with her to
the next meeting, but she warned him on no account
whatever to allow the name of God or of the Saviour to
cross his lips. At the appointed time they stripped and
anointed themselves, and, after uttering the necessary
formula, they were suddenly transported to the Iandes of
Bordeaux, at an immense distance from their own dwelling.
The husband there found himself in the m1dst of a great
assembly of both sexes in the same state of deshabitle as
himself and his wife. aJ1d in one part h.: saw the devit in a
hideous form ; but in the first moment of his surprise he
inadvertently uttered the exclamR.tion, ·• Afon Diw l
c!4 sommes-ncus ? " and all disappeared as suddenly from
his view, leaving him cold and naked in the middle of t he
fields, where he wandered till morning, when the countr.':-
men coming to their <!a1ly occupations told him where he
was, and he made his way home in the best manner he
could. But he lost no time in denouncing his wife, who
WR.S brought to her trial, ccnfessed, and was burnt.
As the witches generally went from their beds at night
to the meetings, leaving their husbands and family behind
them, it may seem extraordinary that their absence was >'lOt
Witchcraft
more frequently perceived. They had, however, a method
of providing against this dR.nger, by casting a drowsiness
over those who might be witnesses. and by placing in their
bed an image which, to all outward ·appearance, bore an
exact rese!"lblance to themselves, although in reality
was nothing more than a besom or some other similar
article. But the belief was so inculcated that the witches
did not always go in body to the Sabbath-that they were
present only in spirit, whilst their body remained in bed.
Some of the more rational writers on witchtYajt taught that
this was the only manner in which they were ever carried
to the Sabbaths, and vanous instances are deposed to
where that was manifestly the C'ase. The president,
Touretta told Bodin that he bad examined a witch, who
was subsequently burnt in the Dauphine, and who was
carried to the SabbR.th in this manner. Her master one
night found her stretched on the floor before the fire in a
state of insensibility and imagined her to be dead. In his
attempt to arouse her, be first beat her body with great
severity, and then applied fire to the more sensitive parts,
which being without effect. he left her in the be'ief that
she had died suddenly. His astonishment WR.S great when
in the morning he found her in her own bed, in an evident
state of great suffering. When he asked what ailed her, her
only answer was, " Ha I mon matstre, tant m'avez batue I "
\Vhen further pressed, however, she confessed that during
the time her body IR.y in a state of insensibility, she had
been herself to the witches' Sabbath, and upon this avowal
she was committed to prison. Bodin further informs us
that at Bordeaux, in 1571, an old woman, who was con-
demned to the tire for witchcraft, and confessed that she was
transported to the Sabbath in this manner. One of her
judges, who was personally known to Bodin, while she was
under cxaminR.tion. pressed her to show him how she was
effected, and released her from the fetters for that purpose.
She rubbed herself in different parts of the body with "a
certain grease," and immediately became stiff and insensible
and, to all appearance, dead. She remained in this state
about five hours, and then as quickly revived, and told her
inquisitors a great number of extraordinary things, which
showed that she must have been spiritually transported to
far distant places.
The description of the SabbR.tb given by the witches
differed only in slight particulars of det;:.il ; for their
examinations were all carried on upon one model and
measure-a veritable bed of Procrustes. and equally fatal
to those who were placed upon it. The Sabbath was, in
general, an immense assemblage of witches and demons,
sometimes from rlistant parts of the earth, at others only
from the province or distnct in which it was held. On
arriving, the ~isitors performed their homage to the evil
one with unseemly ceremonies, and presented their new
converts. They then gave an account of all the mischief
they had done since the l;,st meeting. Those who had
neglected to do evil, or who had so far overlooked them-
selves as to do ~tnod, were treated with disdain, or severely
punished. Several of the victims of the Frer.ch courts
in the latter part of this century confessed thR.t, having
been unwilling or un:>.ble to fulfil the commands of the
evil one, when they appeared at the Sabbath he had
beaten them in the most cruel manner. He took one
womR.n, who hR.d refused to bewitch her neighbour's
c
1aughter, and threatened to drown her in the Moselle.
Others were plagued in tl>cir bodies, or by destruction of
their property. Some were punished for their irregular
attendance at the S:tbbath; and one or two, for slighter
offences, were condemned to wR.Ik home from the Sabbath
instead of !Jeing carried throu~h the ~ir. Those, on the other
band, who had exerted me>st their miscbie"ous pmpensities
were hu;hly honoured at the Sabb2.th, and often rewarded
Wltchcralt 433
with gifts of money. After this examination was passed,
the demon distributed among his worshippers unguents,
powders, and other articles for the perpetration of evil.
A French witch, executed in rsSo, confessed that some of
her companions offered a sheep or a heifer ; and another,
executed the following year, stated that animals of a black
colour were most acceptable. A third, executed at Gerbe-
ville in 1585, declared that no one was exempt from this
offering, and that the poorer sort offered a hen or a chicken,
and some even a lock of their hair, a little bird, or any
trifle, they could put their hands upon. Severe punish-
ments followed the neglect of this ceremony. In many
instances, according to the confessions of the witches,
besides their direct worship of the devil, they were obliged
to show their abhorrence of the faith they had deserted
by trampling on the cross, and blaspheming the saints, and
by other profanations.
Before the termination of the meeting, the new witches
received their familiars, or imps, who they generally
addressed as their " little masters," although they were
bound to attend at the bidding of the witches, and execute
their desires. These received names, generally of a popular
character, such as were given to cats, and dogs. and other
pet animals and the similarity these names bear to each
other in different countries is very remarkable.
After all these preliminary ceremonies had been trans-
acted, and a great banquet was laid out, and the whole
company fell to eating and drinking and making merry. At
times, every article of luxury was placed before them, and
they feasted in the most sumptuous manner. Ofte.n,
however, the meats served on the table w&re nothing but
toads and rats, and other articles of a revolting nature.
In general they bad no salt, and seldom bread. But,
even when best served, the money and the victuals fur-
nished by the demons were of the most unsatisfactory
character ; a circumstance of which no rational explanation
is given. The coin when brou$ht forth by open daylight,
was generally found to be nothlhg better than dried leaves
or bits of dirt ; and, however, greedily they may have eaten
at the table. they commonly left the meeting in a state of
exhaustion from hunger.
The tables were next removed, and feasting gave way
to wild and uproarious dancing and revelry. The common
dance, or carole, of the middle ages appears to have been
performed by the persons taking each other's hand in a
circle, alternately a man and a woman. This, probably the
ordinary dance among the peasantry, was the one generally
practised at the Sabbaths of the witches, with this peculiar-
ity, that their backs instead of their faces were turned
inwards. The old writers endeavour to account for this, by
supposing that it was designed to p'revent them from seeing
and recognising each other. But this, it is clear, was not
the only dance of the Sabbath ; perhaps more fashionable
ones were introduced for witches in better conditions in
society ; and moralists of the succeeding age maliciously
insinuate that many dances of a not very decorous character
invented by the devil l1imself to heat the imaginations
of his victims, had subsequently been adopted in classes in
society who did not frequent the Sabbath. It may be
observed, as a curious circumstance that the modern waltz
is first traced among the meetings of the witches and their
imps I lt was also confessed, in almost every case, that the
dances at the Sabbaths produced much greater fatigue
than commonly arose from such exercises. Many of the
witches declared that, on their return home, they were
usually unable to rise from their bed for two or three days.
The1r music, also, was by no means of an ordinary
character. The songs were generally obscene, or vulgar, or
ridiculous. Of instruments there \Vas considerable variety,
but all partaking of the burlesque character of the proceed-
Witchcraft
ings. " Some played the fiute upon a stick or bone; another
was seen striking a horse's skull for a lyre; there you saw
th_em beating the drum on the trunk of an oak, with a
Stick ; here, others were blowing trumpets with the
branches. The louder the instrument, the greater satis-
fac~io~ it gave:. and the dancing became wilder and wilder,
untiltt merged mto a vast scene of confusion, and ended in
scenes over which, though minutely described in the old
treatises on demonology, it will be better to throw a veil."
The witches separated in time tx> reach their homes before
cock-crow.
We then see that Satan bad taken the place of the
deities of the older and abandoned cults of the non-Aryans,
whose obscene rites were attended by "initiated" or
" adopted " neophytes of a race to the generality of which
they were abominable, that witches often worked by means
of familiars, whose shapes they were able to take, or by
means of direct satanic agency. B\lt there were probably
mythological elements in witchcraft as well.
Powers of Witches.-In the eyes of the populaoe the
powers of witches were numerous. The most peculiar
of these were : The ability to blight by means of the evil
eye (q.v.) the sale of winds to sailors, power over animals,
and capacity to transform themselves into animal shapes.
Thus, says Gomme-" The most usual transformations
are into cats and hares, and less frequently into red deer,
and these have taken the place o! wolves. Thus, cat-
transformations are found in Yorkshire, hare-transforma-
tions in Devonshire, Yorkshire and Wales, and Scotland,
deer-transformations in Cumberland, raven-transformations
in Scotland, cattle-transformations in Ireland. Indeed the
connection between witches and the lower animals is a very
close one, and hardly anywhere in Europe does it occur that
this connection is relegated to a subordinate place. Story
after story, custom after custom is recorded as appertaining
to witchcraft, and animal transformation appears always.
Witches also possessed the power of making themselves
invisible, by means of a magic ointment supplied to them
by the devil, and of harming others by thrusting nails into
a waxen image representing them.
Witchcraft among Savage People.-Witchcraft among
savage people is, of course, allied to the various cults of
demonism in vogue among barbarian folk all over the
world. These are indicated in the various articles dealing
with uncultured races. The name witchcraft is merely a
convenient English label for such savage demon-cults,
as is " witch-doctors " applied to those who " smell out"
these practitioners of evil.
Evidence for Witchcraft.-Tbe evidence for witchcraft,
says Podmore (Modem Spiritualism) falls under four main
heads : (a) the confessions of w.tches themselves ; {b)
the corroborative evidence of lycanthropy, apparitions,
etc. ; {c) the witch-marks ; (d) the evidence of the evil
effects produced upon the supposed victims.
" (a)-The confessions, as 1S notorious, were for the most
part extrac:ted by torture, or- by lying promises of release.
ln England, where torture was not countenanced by the
law, the ingenuity of Matthew Hopkins and other pro-
fessional witch-finders could generally devise some equally
efficient substitute, such as gradual starvation, enforced
sleeplessness, or the maintenance for hours of a constrained
and painful posture. But apart from these extorred con-
fessions, there is evidence that in some cases the accused
persons were actually driven by the accumulation of
testimony against them, by the pressure of public opinion,
and the singular circumstances in which they were placed,
to believe and confess that they were witches indeed.
Some of the women in Salem who bad pleaded guilty to
witdacrajt explained afterwards, when the persecution had
died down and they were released, that they had been
Witchcraft 434
" consternal.cd and affrighted even out of their reason " to
confess that of which they were innocent. And there were
not a few persons who voluntarily confessed to the practice
ot witchcraft, nocturnal rides, compacts with the devil, and
all the rest of it.'' The most striking instances of this
voluntary confession arc afforded by children. For even
among the earlier writers on witchcraft the opinion was not
uncomm9nly held that the nocturnal rides and ban9,uets
with the'devil were merely delusions, thought the gwlt of
the witch was not lessened thereby. And in the sixteenth
centuries, at least in English-speaking countries this
belief seems to have been generally alike by believers in
witchcraft and their opponents. Thus Gaule: " But the
more prodigious or stupendous (of the things narrated by
witches in their confessions) are effected merely by the
devil ; the witches all the whjle either in a rapt ecstasie,
a charmed sleepe, or a melancholy dreame ; and the witches
imagination, phantasic, common sense, only deluded ,.,.ith
what is now done, or pretended. Even Antoinette Bourig-
non, observing her scholars eat " great pieces of bread and
butter " at breakfast, pointed out to them that they could
not have such good appetites if they had really fed on
dainty meats at the dcvil's Sabbath the night before.
" (b)-But if the witch's own account of her marvellous
feats may be explained as, at best, the vague remembrance
of a nightmare, it is hardly necessary to go beyond this
explanation to account £or the prodigies reported by others.
In most ca-~es there is no need to suppose even so much
foundation for the marvels, since the evidence (e.g., for
lycanthropy) is purely traditional. And when we get
accounts at first hand, they arc commonly concerned, not
with such matters as levitation, or transformation of hares
into old women, but merely with vague shapes seen in the
dusk, or the unexplained appearance of a black dog. Even
so the evidence comes almost exclusively from ignorant
peasants. and is given years after the events."
"(c)-The evidence for" witch-marks" does not greatly
concern us. The insensible patches on which :lfatthew
Hopkins and other witch-finders relied may well have been
genuine in some cases. Such insensible areas are known to
occur in hysterical subjects, and the production of insen-
sibility by means of suggestion is a commonplace in modern
times. The supposed witches' teats, which the imps
sucked, appear to have been found almost exclusively, like
the imps themselves, in the English-speaking countries.
Any wart, boil, or swelling would probably form a sufficient
warrant for the accusation ; we read in Cotton ~ather of
a jury of women finding a preter-natural teat upon a
witch's body, which could not be discovered when a second
search was made three or four hours later, and of a witch's
mark upon the finger of a small child, which took the
form of" a deep red spot, about the bigness of a fica-bite."
And the wHch-mark which brought conviction to the
mind of Increase Mather in the case of George Burroughs
was his ability to hold a heavy gun at arm's length, and to
carry a barrel of cider from the canoe lo the shore."
"{d)-01 most of the evidence based upon the injuries
suffered by the witches' sup~osed victims, it is difficult to
speak seriously. If a mans cow ran dry, if his horse
stumbled, his cart stuck in a gate, his pigs or fowls sickened,
if his child had a fit, his ,.,ifc or himself an unaccustomed
pain, it was evidence acceptable in a court of law against
any old woman who might be supposed within the last
twelve months-or twelve years-to have conceived some
cause of offonce against him and his. Follies of this kind
are too well known to need repetition.
But there is another feature of witchcraft, at any rate
of the cases occurring in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries in England and America, which is not so well
recognised, and which bas a more direct bearing upon our
Witchcraft
p~ent inquiry--;-the predominant part played in thc-
mJbal stages of Witch persecution by malevolent or merely
hysterical children and young women."
Symptoms of Bewitchment.-:1-lr. Podmore remarks:
" The symptoms of the alleged bewitchment were, in all
these cases monotonously alike. The victims would fall
into fits or convulsions, of a kind which the physicians
called in were unable to diagnose or to cure. In these fits
the children would commonly call out on the old woman
who was ~e imaginary cause of their ailment; would
profess, at times, to sec her shape present in the room, and
would even stab at it. with a knife or other weapon. (In
the most conclusive cases the record continues that the
old woman, being straightway sought for, would be found
attempting to conceal a corresponding wound on her
person:> . These fits, which sometimes lasted, with slight
mtermtsston, for weeks together would be increased in
violenc:e by the approach of the supposed witch ; or, as
Hutchinson notes, by the presence of sympathetic specta-
tors. The fits, all was also commonly noted by contem-
porary chroniclers, would diminish or altogether cease
when the witch was imprisoned or condemned ; on th&
other hand, if the supposed witch were released the victim
would continue to suffer horrible tortures, insomuch that"
at the Salem trials one old woman who had been acquitted
by the jury was, because of the hideous outcry from the
afflicted persons in court, straightway re-tried and con-
demned. The witch's touch would always provoke severe
attacks, indeed, contact with tho witch or the establishment
of rapport between her and the victim by means of some
garment worn by the latter, as in :1-Iistrcss Faith Corbet's
case, was generally regarded as an essential pre-requisite
of the enchantment. Once this rapport established the
mere look of the witch, or the direction of her evil will
would suffice. The affiicted in Salem were, as the Mathers
testify, much tortured in court by the malevolent glances
of the poor wretches on trial ; and two ' visionary ' girls
added greatly to the weight o£ the evidence by foretelling
with singular accuracy, when such or such of the afllicted
persons then present would feel the baneful influence, and
howl for anguish. Itshould be added-though the evidence
as we now understand. the word, for the fact alleged is of
course practically negligible--that it was commonly
reported that the witch's victim could, although blind-
folded, distinguish her tormentor by the touch alone from
all other persons, and could even foresee her approach and
discern her actions at a considerable distance.
"The effe::t of the convulsions and cataleptic attacks,
which modern science would unhesitatingly dismiss as
being simply the result of hysteria, was heightened in many
cases by manifestations of a more material kind. It was a
common feature for the victim to vomit pins, needles,
wood, stubble, and other substances ; or for thorns or
needles to be found embedded in her flesh. In a case
recorded by Glanvil an hysterical servant girl, Mary
Longdon, in addition to the usual tits, vomiting of pins,
etc., was tormented by stones being continually flung at
her, which stones when they fell to the grO'Und straightway
vanished. Her master bore witness in court to the falling
of the stones and their miraculous disappearance. More-
over, the same l'vlary Longdon would frequently be trans-
ported by an invisible power to the top of the house, and
there " laid on a board betwixt two Sollar beams," or
would be put into a chest, or half suffocated between two
feather-beds.
"Gross as these frauds appear to us, it is singular that
for the most part they remained undetected, and even, it
would seem, unsuspected, not merely by the ignorant
peasants, for whose benefit the play was acted in the first
instance, but in the larger theatre of a law court. But there
Witchcraft 435
are some notorious instances of confession or detection.
Edmund Robinson, the boy on whose accusation the
Lancashire witches were tried, subsequently confessed to
imposture. Other youths were detected with blacklead
in their mouths when foaming in sham epileptic fits,
colouring their urine with ink, concealing crooked pins
about their persons in order to vomit them later, scratch-
ing the bed posts with their toes, and surreptitiously eating
to repletion during a pretended fast. But commonly the
spectators were so convinced beforehand of the ge1;uineness
of such portents that they held it superfluous to examine
the claims of any particular performance of this kind on
their credence.
·• It is difficu It to know in such cases where self-deception
ends and where malevolent trickery begins. Nor would
the examination of these bygone outbreaks of hysteria
trivial in themselves as terrible in their consequences-be
of interest in the present connection, except for the fact
that we find here the primitive form of those Poltergeist
manifestations which gave the popular impetus in 1848 to
the belief in l\Iodern Spiritualism, and which are still
appealed by those who maintain the genuineness of the
physical manifestations of the seance room as instances
of sjmilar phenomena occurring spontaneously."
Difference betwee11 British and Continental Witch~raft.­
The salient difference between British and Continental
witchcraft systems seems to have been that whereas the
former was an almost exclusively female system, the
Continental one favoured the inclusion in the ranks of
sorcerers (as foreign witches were caUed) of the male
element ; this at least was the case in France and Germany,
but there is evidence that in Hungary and the Slavonic
countries, the female element was the more numerous.
In Ireland we find women also pre-eminent ; this is prob-
ably to be accounted for by the circumstance before noted
that the non-alien priesthoods in their decline became
almost entirely dependent upon the offices of women. But
the various forms of witchcraft are duly entered in the
several articles dealing with European countries.
Growth of Belief in Wi~llcraft.-It is significant that
in early times the supernatural side of wi~hcraft won little
public credence. People believed in such things ,as magical
poisoning and the raising of tempests by mtches. but they
refused to give credence to such superstitions as that the
'vitch rode through the air. or had communion in any way
with diabolic agency. As early as 8oo A.D. an Irish synod
pronounced the belief of Bight through the air and vam-
pirism, to be incomeatible with Christian doctrine, and
many early writers like Stephen of Hungary and Regino
state that flight by night and kindred practices are merely
a delusion. Indeed those who held these beliefs were
actively punished by penance. In face of the later develop-
ment of belief in witchcraft, this frank scepticism is almost
amazing, and it is most strange that the tenth and eleventh
centuries should have rejected superstitions embraced
widely by the sixteentl1 and seventeenth.
From the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries we find the
conception of witchcraft and demonology greatly furthered
and assisted by the writings of scholars and the institu-
tion of the Inquisition to deal mth the rise of unbelief.
A vast amount of literature was circulated dealing with
questions relating to magic and sorcery, and regarding the
habits and customs of witches, magicians and practitioners
in ·• black magic," and many hairs were split. The Church
gladly joined in this campa1gn against what it regarded as
the forces of darkness, and indeed both accused and accusers
seem to have lingered under the most dreadful delusions-
delusions which were to cost society dear as a whole. The
scholastic conception of demonology was that the witch
was not a woman but a demon. Rationalism was at a
Witchcraft
discount and the ingenuity of medi<eval scholars disposed
of all objections to the phenomena of witchcraft. The
deities of ,Pagan times were cited as practitioners of sorcery,
and erudttion, especially in .ecclesiastical circles, ran riot
on the subject. There also arose a class of judges or
inquisitors like Bodin in France and Sprenger in Germany,
who composed lengthy treatises upon the manner of
discovering witches, of l?utting them to the test, and
generally of presiding in Witchcraft trials. The cold-blooded
cruelty of these textbooks on current demonology can only
be accounted for by the likelihood that their authors felt
themselves justified in their composition through motives
of fidelity to their church and religion. The awful terror
disseminated especially among the intelligent by the
possibility of a charge of witchcraft being brought against
them at any moment brougl\t about an intolerable con-
dition of things. The intellectual might be arraigned at
any time on a charge of witchcraft by any rascal who cared to
make it. Position or learning were no safeguard against
such a charge, and it is peculiar that the more thoughtful
and serious part o£ the population should not have made
some attempt to put a period to the dreadful condition of
affairs brought about by ignorance and superstition. Of
course the principal reason against their being able to do so
was the fact that the whole system was countenanced by
the Church, in whose hanus the entire procedure of trials
for witchcraft lay.
Strangely enough convents and monasteries were often
the centres of demoniac possession. The conception of
the incubi and succubi undoubtedly arose from the ascetic
tortures of the monk anu the nun. Wholesale trials, too,
of wretched people who were alleged to attend Sabbatic
orgies of the enemy of mankind on dreary heaths were
gone through with an elaborateness which spread terror
in the public mind. The tortures inflicted on those un-
fortunates were generally of the most fiendish des-
cription, but they were supposed to be for the good of
the souls ot those who bore them. In France the majority
of these trials took place in the fifteenth century; whereas
in England we find that most of them were current in the
seventeenth century. Full details regarding these mil
be follnd in the articles France and England. The
famous outburst of fanaticism in ~ew England under
Cotton Mather (See America) in 1691 to 1692 was by no
means the last in an English-speaking country, for in 1712
a woman was convicted of witchcraft in England, and in
Scotland the last trial and execution for sorcery took place
in 1722. In Spa.in we find burnings by the Inquisition in
1781 ; in Germany as late as 1793. and as regards Latin
South America a woman was burned in Peru so r~ently as
r888. The death of the belief in witchcraft \vas brought
about by a more sane spirit of criticism than had be~ore
obtained. Even the dull wits of the inquisjtorial and other
courts began to see that the wretched creatures upon
whom they passed sentence either confessed because of the
extremity of torture they had to suffer, or else were under
hallucination regarding the nature of their connection with
the satanic power. Reginald Scot in his Discot•ery of
Witchcraft (r584) proved that the belief on the part of the
witch that sbe was a servant of the Devil was purely
imaginary, and in consequence drew upon his work the
wrath of the British Solomon, James I., who warmly
replied to him in his Demonologie. But Friedrich von
Spee's Cautio Crimit~t~lis, 1631, advanced considerations of
still greater weight from the rationalistic point of view-
considerations of such wci~ht indeed that Bodin, the arch-
demonologist, denounced htm and demanded that he should
be added to the long list of his victims.
Psychology of Witcltcraft.-No doubt exists nowadays
when the conditions of savage witchcraft have been closely
Witchcraft 436 Worlds, Planes, or Spheres
examined and commented upon, that the witch and the
sorcerer of the Middle Ages·, like their prototypes among
the native races of Africa, America, Asia and elsewhere,
have a firmly-rooted belief in their own magical p_ower;;.
and in their connection with unseen and generally diabolic
agencies. It is a ~trange circumstance that in .many
instances the confessiOns wrung from two or more w1tches,
when a number of them have been concerned in the same
case have tallied with one anQthllr in almost every detail.
Thi; would imply that these women suffered from collective
hallucination, and actually believed that they had seen
the supernatural beings with whom they confessed fellow-
ship, and had gone through the rites and acts for which
they suffered. A period :!rrived in the medi<eval campaign
against wit&hcraft when it \vas admitted that the whole sys-
tem was one of hallucination; yet, said the de.monologists,
this was no palliation of the offence. for it was equally as
evil to imagine such diabolic acts as actually to take part
in them.
There is also evidence which would lead to the belief
that the witch possessed certain minor powers of hypnotism
and telepathy, which would give her real confidence in her
belief that she wielded magical terrors. Again the phen-
omena of spiritualism and the large possibilities it offers
for fraud suggest that some kindred system might have
been in use amongst the more-shrewd or the leaders in
these Sabbatic meetings, which would thoro,1ghly con-
vince the ignorant among the sisterhood of the existence in
their midst of diabolic powers. Trance and hysteria,
drugs and salves, there is good reason to believe, were
also used unsparingly, but the great source of witch-
belief undoubtedly exists in auto-suggestion, fostered and
fomented from ecclesiastical and scholastic sources, and
by no means lessened by popular belief.
Since the above article was written an exhaustive
examination of the phenomena of witds&raft has been made
by :Miss M.A. Murray,lecturer on Egyptology at University
College, London. Basin~ her conclusions upon the sug-
gestions of C. G. Leland, 1n his " Aradia, or the Witches of
Italy," and t.hose of other modem writers.. she inclines to
the hypothesis t11at witchcraft was in reality the modern
and degraded descendant of an ancient nature-religion, the
rites of which were actually carried out in deserted places
and included child-sacrifice and other barbarous customs.
In the Satanic presence at such gatherings she sees the
attendance of a priest of the cult. In brief, her hypothesis
tends to prove the actual reality of the witch-religion as
against that of hallucination which, until recently, was the
explanation accepted by students of the subject. Her
remarks, too, upon the familiar, go to show that a large
body of proof e>dsts for the belief that this conception also
rested upon actual occurrences. (See her papers in l't'Ia1t
and elsewhere.)
Recent researches on the part of the v.'Titer have con-
vinced him of the soundness of these views, but have added
the conviction that witchcraft religion was, in some manner,
possessed of an equestrian connection, the precise nature
of which is still dark to him. The broomstick appears to be
the magical equivalent of a horse, the witches occasionally
rode to the Sabbath on horseback, and one of the tests
for a witch was to see if her eye held the reftection or like-
ness of a horse. May it not be that the witch-religion was
the remnant of a prehistoric horse-totem cult ? But this
is, after all, merely of the nature of surmise. The writer
has also found good evidence for the existence of a witch-
cult precisely similar to that of Europe in pre-Columbian
Mexico, and has even encountered a picture of a naked
witch with peaked cap riding on a broomstick in the
native .Mexican p<l.inting known as the Codex Fejervary-
Mayer, which seems to show that the witch-religion was
in no sense limited to Europe, and was of most ancient
origin.
Woll, The: Amongst the ancient Romans, the wolf was a.
fruitful seutce of augury, e.nd many are the tales in which
he has figured as a good or evil omen. A wolf running to
the right with his moutl! full was a sign of great joy. If a
wolf, after he had entered a Roman camp, escaped unhurt
it was regarded as a sign of defeat ; and the terrible result
of the second Punic war was said to have been augured
from the carrying off of the sword of a sentinel in the camp
by a wolf. Plutarch tells of a wolf who ate the landmarks
of a proposed new settlement at Libya and thus stopped its
colonisation ; but later another wolf which had stolen a.
burnt sacrifice led his pursuers to a place where they after-
wards settled in. It is said that a wolfran off with Hiero's
slate when he was a schoolboy, and this was regarded as a
sign of his future greatness. The peasants of Sweden do
not dare to speak of a wolf by name but call him the " grey
one " or " old grey " : they seem to regard the pronounc-
ing of his name as unlucky.
Wonders of the Invisible World: (See America, U.S. ot.)
Woriel Period : (See Planetary Chains.)
Worlds, Planes, or Spheres: According to theosophists,
these are seven in number and are as follows : The older
Sanskrit names, which arc now superseded, being given
for reference :-Divine, or Adi; Monadic or Anutadaka,
Spiritual or Nirvana, Intuitional or Buddhi, Mental or
Manas, Astral or Kama, and Physical or Slhula. These
worlds arc not physically separate in the manner which
planets appear to be. but interpenetrate each other, and
they depend for their differences, on the relative density
of the matter which composes them, and the consequent
difference in the rates at which the matter of each world
vibrates.
Except for the physical world {the densest) our know-
ledge of them, so far as it extends. is dependent on clair-
voyance, and the more exalted the vision of the clairvoyant
the higher the world to which his vision can pierce. Each
world has its appropriate inhabitants, clothed in appro-
priate bodies, and possessing appropriate states of con-
sciousness. The two highest worlds, the Divine and the
Monadic are at present incapable of attainment by human
powers, the remaining five are i.n greater or less degree.
The monad for the purpose of gathering experience and
for development, finds it necessary to pass downwards into
the matenal sphere, and, when it has taken possession of
the spiritual, intuitional, and higher Mental Worlds, it may
be looked on as an ego or soul embodying will, intuition and
intellect, continuing eternally the same entity, never
altering except by reason of increasing development, and
hence being immortal. These Worlds, however, do not
afford sufficient scope to the Monad and it presses ~ ill
farther down into matter. through the lower Mental, h.to
the Astral and Physical Worlds. The bodies with which
it is there clothed form its personality and this personality
suffers death and is renewed at each fresh incarn::o.tion.
At the death of the physical body, the ego has merely
cast aside a garment and thereafter continues to live in the
next higher world, the Astral.
At the death of the Astral body in tum, another garment
is cast aside. the ego is clear of all appendages and as it was
before its descent into denser matter, having returned to
the ::VIental World, the Heaven World. The ego finds itself
somewhat strange to this owing to insufficient development,
and it agam descends into matter as before. This round is
completed again and again, and each time the ego returns
with a fresh store of experience and knowledge, which
strengthens and perfects the mental body. \>Vhen at last
this process is complete, this body in turn is cast aside and
the ego is clothed with its ellsual body. Again it finds
Wraith 437
itself strange and the round of descents mto matters again
begins and continues till the casual body has been fully
developed. The two remaining worlds arc but imperfectly
known but the intuitional, as it's name indicates is that
where the ego's vision is quickened to see things as they
really are, anJ in the Spiritual World the divine and
the human become unified and the divine purpose is
fuUiUed. (See the articles on the various Worlds and
bodies Theosophy, Monad, Evolution, Reincarnation.)

such as" waff," "swarth," " task," "fye," etc. Variants
of the wraiths are the Irisil" fetch" (q.v.), and the Welsh
" Iledrith." In Scotland it was formerly believed that the
wraith.of one about to die might be seen wrapped in a
winding-sheet. The higher the shroud reached the nearer
was the approach of death. Something analogous to
wraith-seeing comes within the scope of modern psychical
science, and the apparition is explamed in various ways, as
a projection of the " astral body," an emanation from the
person of its living prototype, or, more scientifically
perhaps, on a telepathic basis. A well-known case in point
is that of the DirkbeekGhost, where three children witnessed
the apparition of their mother shortly before her death.
This instance, which is recorded i.n the " Proceedings " of
the Psychical Research Society, is noteworthy because of
the fact that Mrs. Birkbec!C was conscious before she died
of having spent the time with her children.
Wraith : The apparition or " double " of a living person,
generally supposed to be an omen of death. The wraith
closely resembles its prototype in the flesh. even to details
of dress. It is believed possible for people to see theu own
wraiths, and among tho,;e who have been warned of
approaching dissolution in this wise are numbered Queen
Elizabeth, Shelley, and Catherine of Russia, the latter of
whom, seeing her " double" seated upon the throne,
ordered her guards to fire upon it I But wraiths of others
may appear to one or more persons. Lord Balcarres saw
the wrtuth of his friend " Bonnie Dundee " at the moment
when the latter fell at Killiecrankie, while Ben Jonson saw Wronski : (See France.)

Xylomanoy : Divination by means of wood, practised

from the position of small pieces of dry wood found in one's
path. No less certain presages of future events may be
drawn from the arrangement of logs in the fire-place, from
t he manner in which they burn, etc. It is perhaps the
survival of this mode of divination which makes the good
people say, when a brand is disturbed, that " they are
going to have a visitor."

Y·Kim, Book or : A Chinese mystical book attributed to the
Emperor Fo-Hi, and ascribed to the year, 3468 B.C. It
consists of ten chapters, and is stated by Eliphas Levi in his
History of Magic to be a complement and an appendix to
the Kabalistic Zohar, or record of the utterances of
Rabbi Simeon Ben Jochai. The Zohar, says Levi, explains
universal equilibrium, and the Y-Kim is the hieroglyphic
and ciphered demonstration thereof. The key to the
Y-Kim is a pantaele known as the Trigrams of Fo-Hi. In
the Vay-Ky of Lcon-Tao-Yuen, composed in the Som
dynasty (about eleventh century) it is recounted that the
Emperor Fo-Hi was one day seated on the banks of a
river. deep in meditation, when to him there appeared an
animal having the parts of both a horse and a dragon. Its
back was covered with scales, on each of which shone the
mystic Trigrammic symbol. This animal initiated the
just and righteous Fo-Hi into universal science. Number-
ing its scales, be combined the Trigrams in such a manner
that there arose in his mind a synthesis of sciences com-
pared and united with one another through the harmonies
of nature. From this synthesis sprang the tables of the
Y-Kim. The numbers of &-Hi arc identical with those
of the Kabala, and his pantaclc is similar to that of
Solomon. His tables are in correspondence with the
subject-matter of the SephiY Yetzirah and the Zohar. The
whole is a commentary upon the Absolute which is con-
cealed from the profane, concludes Levi, but as he had little
real acquaintance with the subject, these analogies must
be taken as of small value.

Yaksha or Jak : A species of Indian fiend or imp. Says Mr.
Crookes : " The ] all is the modern representative of the
leaksha, who in better times was the attendant of Kuvera,
the god of wealth, in which duty he was assisted by the
Gohyaka. The character of the Yallsha is not very certain
He was called Punya-janas, " the good people," but be
sometimes appears as an imp of evil. In the folk-tales, it
must be admitted. the Yallshas have an equivocal reputa-
tion. In one story the female, or Yakshini, bewilders
travellers at night, makes horns grow on their foreheads, and
finally devours them; in another the Yallshas have, like
the Churel, feet turned the wrong way and squinting eyes ;
in a third they separate the hero from the heroine because
he failed to make due offerings to them on his wedding day.
On the other hand, in a fourth tale the Yakshini is des·
cribed as possessed of heavenly beauty; she appears:':again
when a sacrifice is made in a cemetery to get her into the
hero's power, as a heavenly maiden beautifully ador?ed·
seated in a chariot of gold surrounded by lovely grrls ;
and lastly, a Brahman meets some Buddhist ascetics,
performs the Uposhana vow, and would have become a
god, had it not been that a wicked man compelled him by
force to take food in the evening, and so he was re-born as a
Guhyaka.
" I n the modern folk-lore of Kashmir, the Yaksha has
turned into the Yech or Yach, a humorous, though power-
ful, S)?rite in the·shape of a civet cat of a dark colour, with
a wh•te cap on his head. This small high cap is one of the
marks of the Irish fairies, and the Incubones of Italy wear
caps, • the symbols of their hidden, secret natures.' The
feet of the Yech are so small as to be almost invisible, and
it squeaks in a feline way. It can assume. any shape. and
if its white cap can be secured, it becomes the servant of
the possessor, and the white cap makes him invisible.
" In the Vishnu Purana we read that Vishnu created the
Yakshas as beings emaciate with hunger, of hideous
aspect, and with big beards, and that from their habit of
crying for food they were so named. By the Buddhists
they were regarded as benignant spirits. One of them
acts as sort of chorus in the Meghaduta or ' Cloud Messen-
ger • of Kalidasa. Yet we read of the Yalla Alawalla,
who, according to the Buddhist legend, used fo live in a
Yauhabu 438 Zachaire, Denis
Banyan tree, and slay any one who approached it ; while
in Ceylon they are represented as demons whom Buddha
destroyed. In later Hinduism they arc generally of fair
repute, ,and one of them was appointed by Indra to be the
attendant of the Jaina, Saint Mahavira."

Yeats, William Butler: Irish Author and :\<Iystk William
Butler Y eats was born at Dublin in 1866, his father being
John 'Yeats, a talented portrait-painter whose works
include a fine likeness of Synge ; and during his boyhood
the future author lived chie6y at his native town, and
occasionally with his grandparents in County Sl1go. At
first he intended to make painting his life's work, an<S
accordingly he entered the Dublin Art School ; but be
soon left it, having realised that his true bent was for
Literature ; and in 1887 he went to London, where be
became intimate with Mr. Arthur Symons, and subse-
quently with Mr. George Moore. Prior to this Mr. Yeats
bad issued a little play, Mosada ; and now his gifts began
to develop apace, the result being sundry volumes of
beautiful poetry, notably The Wande,-ings of Oisin and
The Wind among the Reeds. At this time, also, the author
began to show himself an eminently thoughtful critic of
literature; while in 1870 he published a collection of
Irish folk tales, and in the preface thereto he observed in
relation to his compatriots that " a true literary conscious·
ness-national to the centre-seems gradually to be
forming out of all this disguising and prettyfing this
penumbra of half-culture. \Ve are preparing likely
enough for a new Irish literary movement....." Nor
was the prophecy unfulfilled, for, during the closing decade
of the 19th century, the intellectuals of Ireland began to
manifest a tense interest in their country's legendary lore,
while simultaneously it transpired that the rising genera-
tion of writers in Ireland included many men of fine promise.
Most of these last regarded Jl!Y. Y eats as their leader, they
rallied round him, he returned from London to Ireland, and
anon be achieved the founding of the Irish Literary Theatre
in Dublin, its Yaisou d'elre being the staging of plays by the
new school of Hibernian authors.
This is not the place to detail the Irish artistic revival of
the nineties of last century, and the reader may be referred
to the monograph thereon by ~lr. H . S. Krans, and more
especially to ;\tr. George :\foores' IIail and FMewell. Pass-
ing to speak of ,\fr. Y eats' contributions to the literature of
Mysticism, these arc mostly contained in a volume of
collected essays, Ideas of Good a1zd Evil; and prominent
among them arc studies of the mystic element in Blake and
Shelley, while another notable paper is one concerned with
" The Body of the Father Christian Rosencrux." But
still more important than these, perhaps, is a long study
of ·· ::\Iagic," contained in the same volume, and here the
author begins by bravely stating his creed: " I believe in
the practice and philosophy of what we have agreed to call
magic, and what I must call the evocation of spirits, though
I do not know 'vhat they arc, in the power of creating
magical illusions, in.the visions of truth in the depths of the
mind when the eyes arc closed......"
After this declaration he tells bow once an acquaintance
of his, gathering together a small party in a darkened
room, held a mace over" a tablet of many coloured squares,
at the same time repeating " a form of words" ; and
straightway Mr. Yeats found that his" imagination began to
move of itself, and to bring before me vivid images.. .. ."
He goes on to descant on these visions, while in the re·
mainder of his essay he offers some details about super-
stitions in remote parts of Ireland ; and also furnishes
sundry examples of thought-transmission and the like,
most of them fresh and interesting.
But the author's interest in the supernatural does not
transpire only in his prose, and, turning to his poems, one
finds them permeated by a curious kind of mysticism which
is perhaps essentially Celtic. For M,-. Yeats, it would
seem, is only incidentally interested in holding communi·
cations with the dead, or with the spirit-world ; yet, like
old bards of his native Ireland, he seems to find inanimate
nature a living reality, he seems to have a strange intimacy
therewith. A dreamer of dreams and a beholder of visions,
be frequently crystalises these in his verse; but the
mystic element in his output consists pre-eminently in
this, that he appears to hold actual converse with all those
things which to ordinary men are no more than lifeless-
with flowers and trees, with rivers, lakes and mountains.

Yetziratie World: (See Kabala.)
Yoga, meaning " union," is applied in theosophy to assistance
rendered to evolutionary process. The theosophical idea
of evolution postulates a universal consciousness from
which particular consciousness has come and to which each
is returning along the path of evolution. The journey
along this path can be quickened by the Yoga, the union
of each particular with the universal consciousness. By
the concentration of thought on any particular idea, j:hat
idea, in course of time becomes worked into the constitu·
tion of the thinker, so that, if the thought be good he will
correspondingly help on the process of evolution. This
general principle, applied in the light of past experience to
the multifarious activities of the human mind, is of vast
importance and influence in the moulding of the characters
both of individuals and communities. (See The Path,

Zabulon : A demon 'vho possessed a lay sister of Loudon.
Zachaire, Denis : Alchemist. This French alchemist is
chiefly remembered by his book, Opuscule de la Pllilosophie
de Metaux, tYaitatll de l'Augmentation el Perfection de ceux,
and in the preface thereto he gives some account of his
life, yet fails to state the precise date at which he was born.
Ho\vever, the event is commonly supposed to have ta}cen
place about 1510; \vhile it is known that Denis was a
native of La Guyenne, and that his parents were com-
fortably off, if not actually rich. As a young man be
studied at Bordeaux, and subsequently at Toulouse,
intending to become a lawyer; yet he soon became more
interested in alchemy than in legal affairs, and in 1535. on
his father's death putting him in possession of some money,
he decided to try and multiply it by artificial means.
Associating himself with an abbe who was reckoned a
great adept in gold-making, Denis bad soon disposed of the
bulk of his patrimony ; but the charlatan's futile experi-
ments, far !rom disillusioning him, $erved rather to nerve
him to further endeavours, and in 1539 he went to Paris,
where he made the acquaintance of many renowned
alchemists. From one of them, so he declares, he imbibed
the precious secret ; and thereupon ho hastened to the court
of the King of Navarre, Antoine d'Albert, grandfather of
Henri IV., offering to make gold if the requisite materials
were supplied. His majesty was deeply interested, and
Zacornu 439 Ziito
promised a reward of no less than four thousand crowns
in the event of the researches proving fruitful ; but
Zacllaires' vaunted skill failed him in the hour of need. and
he retired discomfited to Toulouse. Here he became
friendly ";th a certain priest, who advised him strongly to
renounce his quest, and study natural science instead ; so
De11is went off to Paris once more, intending to act in
accordance with hi!' counsel. Ere a little while, neverthe-
less, he was deep in alchemy again, making actual experi-
ments, and studying closely the writings of R<~.ymond
Lully and Arnold di Villanov~ ; while, according to his
own account of his career, on Easter day in the year Ij50
be succeeded in converting a large quantity of quick-
silver into gold. Then, some time after this alleged triumph,
he left France to travel in Switzerland, and Jived for a
while at Lausanne ; while later on he wandered to Ger-
many, and there he died. It is probable that his closing
years were spent in dire poverty, but this is not recorded
definitely, nor has the exact date of the alchemist's demise
ever been ascertained.
As regards the book by Zachaire cited above, it was
published originally at Antwerp in 1567, it was repeatedly
reprinted thereafter, and even won the honour of being
translated into Latin; while to this day, indeed, it is
sought keenly by French philosphers with a taste for the
curious.
Zacornu : A tree in the Mohamedan hell, which has for
fruit the heads of devils.
Zadkiel : One of the angels in the Jewish rabbinical legend
of the celestial hierarchies. He is the ruler of Jupiter, and
through him pass grace, goodness, mercy, p1ety, and
munificence, and he bestows clemency, benevolence and

Zaebos : Grand count of the infernal regions. He appears in
the shape of a handsome soldier mounted on a crocodile.

He appears under the form of a bull with the wings of a
griffin. lie changes water into wine, blood into oil, the

Thirty legions obey him.
Zahuris or Zahorles : French people who had travelled in
Spain frequently had curious tales to tell concerning the
Zahuris ; people who were so keen-sighted that they could
see streams of water and veins of metal hidden in the
earth, and could indicate the whereabouts of buried
treasure and the bodies of murdered persons. Explana-
tions have been offered on natural lines. It was said that
these men knew where water was to be found by the
-vapours arising at such sr.ots; and that they were al)Je
1:0 trace mines of gold and silver and copper by the particuh•
herbs growing in their neighbourhood. But to the Spaniard
·such explanations are unsatisfactory; they persist in
believing that the Zahuris are gifted with supernatural
facultie:;, that they arc en t-apport with the demons, and
that, if they wished, they could, without any physical aid,
read thoughts and discover secrets which were as a sealed
book to the grosser senses of ordinary mortals. For the
rest, the Zahuris have red eyes; and in order that one
should become a Zahuri it is necessary that he should have
been born on Good Friday.

Zapan : According to Wierius, one of the Kings of Hell.
Zedekias : Notwithstanding the credulity of the French
people in tl1e reign of Pepin the Short, they refused to
believein the existence of elementary spirits. The Kabalist
Zedeki.a.<, being minded to convince the world, thereupon
commanded the sylphs to become visible to all men.
According to the Abbe de Villars, the admirable creatures
responded magnificently. They were beheld in human
form, sometimes ranged 10 battle, whether marching in
good order, or under arms, or camping in superb pavilions;
and, again, i.o aerial navies of marvellous structure, whose
flying flotillas sailed through the air, at the will of the
ZephyYs. But the ignorant generation to which they
appeared failed entirely to understand the significance of
the strange spectatlc. They believed at first that the
creatures were sorcerers who had betaken themselves to
aerial regions for the purpose of exciting storms and
sending dO\VO bail on the harvests. The sages and juris-
consuls were of the popular opinion. The emperors shared
the same idea, which became so widespread that even the
wise Charlemagne, and after b.im Louis the Dcbonnair,
imposed heavy penalties on these supposed aerial tyrants.

Zeernebooch : A dark god, monarch of the empire of the
dead among the ancient Germans.
Zepar: Grand duke of the infernal empire, who may be
identical with Vcpar, or Scpar. Nevertheless, under the
name of Zepar he has the form of a warrior. He casts men
into the ev•l passions. Twenty-eight legions obey him.
Ziazaa : A black and white stone ; it renders its possessor
litigious, and causes terrible visions.
Ziito : One of the most remarkable magicians of whom
history has left any record. He was a sorcerer at the court
of King \¥enceslaus of Bohemia (afterwards Emperor of
Germany) towards the end of the fourteenth century, and
among bis more famous exploits is one chronicled by
Dulsavius, bishop of Olmutz, in his History of Bohemia.
On the occasion of the marriage of Wenceslaus with Sophia,
daughter of the elector Palatine of Bavaria, the elector,
knowing his son-in·law's liking for juggling and magical
exhibitions. brought in his train a number of morris-dancers,
jugglers and such entertainers. When they came forward
to give their exhibition Ziito remained unobtrusively
among the spectators. He was not entirely unnoticed,
however, for his remarkable appearance drew the attention
of those about him. His oddest feature was his mouth,
which actually stretched from car to ear. After watching
the magicians for some time in silence, Ziito appeared to
become exasperated at the halting way in which the tricks
were carried through, and going up to the principal magician
he taunted him with incompetency. The rival professor
hotly defended his performance, and a discussion ensued
wbicb was ended at last by Ziito swallowing his opponent,
just as he stood, leaving only his shoes, which he said were
dirty and unfit for consumption. After this extraor~nary
feat, be retired for a little while to a closet, from which he
shortly emerged, leading the rival magician by the band.
He then gave a performance of his own which put the
former exhibition entirely in the shade. He changed
himself into many divers shapes, taking the form of fust
one person and t.ben another, none of whom bore any
resemblance either to himself or to each other. In a car
drawn by barn-door fowls he kept pace with the King's
carriage. When the guests were assembled at dinner, he
played a multitude of elfish tricks on them, to their amuse-
ment or annoyance, as the case might be. Indeed, he w~s
at all times an exceedin::ly mischievous. cr~ture as IS
shown by another story told of hi>:n. Fe1grung to be m
want of money, and apparently casting about anxiously for
the means of obtaining some, be at length took a handful
of corn, and made it look like thirty fat hogs. These he
took to ~fichael, a rich but very mean dealer. The latter
purchased them after some haggling, but was warned n~t to
Jet them drink at the river. But the warning was disre-
garded, and the hogs turned into grains of corn. Tl.:.<>
enraged dealer went in search of Ziito, whom he found at
last in a vintner's ~!-op. In vain Michael shouted and
Zizis 440 Zulu Witch.flnders
stamped, the magician took no notice, but seemed to be in
a fit of abstraction. The dealer, beside himself, seized
Ziito's foot and pulled it as hard as he could. To his
dismay, tbe foot and leg came right off, \\"hile Ziito screamed
lustily, and hauled Michael before the jud~e. where the two
presented their complaints. What the decision was,
history does not .relate, but it is unlikely that the ingenious
Ziilo came off worse.

Zoaphite: According to tbe Journal des Voyages of Jean
Struys, a species of Cucumber which feeds on neighbouring
plants. Its fruit has tbe form of a lamb, with the head,
feet, and tail of that animal distinctly apparent, whence it
it is called, in tbe language of tbe country, Ct~naret, or
Conarer, signifyin~ a lamb. Its skin is covered with a
white down as dehcate as silk. The Tartars think a great
deal of it and most oftbem keep it carefuily in their houses,
where the author of the Journal des Voyages saw it several
times. It grows on a stalk about three feet in he1ght, to
which it is attached by a sort of tendril. On this tendril
it can move about, and turn and bend towards the herbs
on which it feeds, and without which it soon drys up and
withers. Wolves love it, and devour it with avidity,
because it tastes like the Bash of ·amb. The author adds
that he has been assured that it has bones, Besh, and blood,
\Vhence it is also known in its native country as Zoaphite.
