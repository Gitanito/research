OBITUARY
ACK WEBBER passed into spirit life, after a very
short illness, on March 9th, 1940, aged thirty-three
years.
The manuscript of this book was in the publisher's
hands in January, 1940.
As the book had been written while Jack Webber was
still with us, and a long life of service contemplated, it
has been emphasized in the Foreword and Conclusions
that as the mediumship was contemporary, every state
ment made regarding the phenomena was capable of
being re-demonstrated under test conditions before
impartial authorities. That position has now, unfor
tunately, been altered.
In consultation with the publishers, it was, neverthe
less, decided to publish the work as originally written,
with the addition of this explanation.
In order to include the 1940 photographs, and in
order to make the record complete, addenda have been
added to various chapters.
For the interest of readers it may be added that at no
time was any weakening of the mediumship noticeable.
The number of occasions on which Mr. Webber demon
strated was strictly limited and the rules were never
exceeded. The Guides were frequently consulted as to
the medium's physical condition, and no anxiety or hint
of weakening was disclosed. Mr. Webber enjoyed a
strong constitution and had not had a day's illness since
he was fourteen years of age, until this year. Therefore
there is no known reason to assume that his passing was
in any way connected with his mediumship.
It was only twelve days before the passing that the

remarkable photograph (Plate No. 7) was obtained, and
during the week previous to his passing he gave two
very fine seances to the Spiritualist Community in
London.
While the loss of the mediumship to the Spiritualist
movement is great, the personal loss has been much
alleviated by our knowledge of the reality of survival,
the evidence already received of his return (see Chapter
XXII), and the many tributes to his mediumship and
uplifting letters received.
His work amongst us is finished, his new work has
commenced.

CHAPTER I
FOREWORD
THIS
book presents a series of photographs of
supernormal activity and a narrative of events
incidental to them.
They have been secured through the physical medium-
ship of Mr. Jack Webber during the fourteen months
from November, 1938, to December, 1939. They are not
ancient history, they are contemporary and are being
repeated many times a year, now.
If the photographs or any statements made are
challenged, it is of the utmost importance to remember
that the mediumship is still functioning and demon
strations are being continually given.1
No special set stage is necessary. Mr. Webber gives
between one hundred and fifty and two hundred demon
strations a year, by far the greater number in places to
which he is a complete stranger. As a rule he journeys
unaccompanied, so that pre-arrangement or confederacy
is out of the question.
In 1939, over four thousand persons witnessed the
phenomena, from small home circles to mass seances
of five hundred people.
The photographs have been taken in different places,
sometimes in surroundings that the medium has never
before visited. Quite often he has arrived only a few
minutes before the commencement of the sitting. The
photographers have been official press photographers
representing national newspapers who have provided

their own cameras and plates and undertaken all process
work in their own studios. Other persons who have
taken photographs have only been present through their
possessing a suitable camera.
The sitters who have been present during the period
under review represent many professions, including
official representatives of the British Broadcasting
Corporation, National Newspapers, the Editors of the
Psychic News, the Two Worlds, Light, and the U.S.A.
Journal of Psychical Research, Admirals of the Fleet,
Clergymen, Doctors, Scientists, University Officials,
etc., while Psychical Research Societies in London and
the provinces have tested the mediumship over and over
again.
A sceptical mind has to face the fact that the photo
graphs and reports are true. Otherwise there must
have been a gigantic conspiracy embracing many
hundreds of people, including organizations and news
papers of note, all actively participating in fraudulent
acts to deceive the public without motive or reward.
Newspapers and their critical representatives are only
too willing to expose fraudulent mediums ; yet all,
without exception, have testified to the mediumship
under review. No critic, worthy of the name, would
classify all the alert, questioning minds that have
testified to the mediumship of Jack Webber as dupes
or simpletons.
To produce faked photographs, as perfect as those
reproduced, would include a number of the most
reputable photographic firms in the conspiracy ; also
the technical staffs of the newspapers whose names
are printed in the reports. Actually, the question
of faking negatives cannot arise since the phenomena
are visible to all present when the exposure flash is
made.
Finally, a hostile mind has to take into account the
scores of reports published in the psychic and general
Press by correspondents of unimpeachable integrity,

who have voluntarily supplied appreciative commen
taries on the mediumship. Numbers of these reports
are included with names and dates of publication.
Three independent accounts of seances are published,
two by official representatives of our national daily
newspapers, reprinted word for word, and the other
from the pen of one well versed in psychic research.
These give a good impression of the happenings at a
typical seance.
The purpose of this book is to add a little to the
known proven knowledge of the powers of the spirit
people manifesting through a human medium.
Phenomena occur when the medium deliberately sits
for their manifestation in a state of deep trance and
with his normal consciousness dormant. In this
state of acquiescent dormancy the right physical and
mental condition for the operation of psychic powers
is attained. Thus an invitation is extended for the
manifestations.
Every movement of matter, every vibration and
radiation, even life itself, are subject to definite forces
controlled by law.
The simple action of lifting an object into the air,
and returning it to the place from whence it came,
brings into action a controlling mind force. To carry
out a similar action by psychic force denotes the presence
of an intelligence possessing the knowledge of applying
psychic forces to a physical object. For intricate and
involved operations, of which the photographs in this
volume are corroborative evidence, the controlling
intelligence must possess an extensive knowledge of both
physical and metaphysical forces and the laws that
control them.
Since no human mind is capable of manipulating,
under seance or any other conditions, a medium's
mind or body to produce the phenomena described, it is

logical to infer that the controlling intelligence is
non-human.
Such happenings cannot be the product of the
medium's sub-conscious mind, for there has been no
human experience from which a sub-conscious mind
can draw such knowledge.
Therefore, if the performance of the many acts
chronicled are completely outside man's compre
hension, the salient fact emerges —there is no alter
native —that the operating intelligence must belong to
a discarnate entity, and that, therefore, spirit people do
exist.
Realizing this, there is no reason why we should not
accept the statements of the spirit-controls that they once
lived on the earth. Unquestionable evidence is further
provided by the spirit people themselves who return
to their relatives in a recognizable materialized form and
speak in their own voice and language of intimate
mutual earth experiences. Since this is so, it is indis
putable that our relatives and friends must still be
"
living
" to be able to communicate so. If this
book establishes this position its purpose will be
achieved.
The value to humanity of proving beyond all doubt
the truth of survival is incalculable. With the recogni
tion that this life is but a prelude to a further and more
enlightened existence, the nature of which is individual
and therefore dependent upon our conduct here, so
must a transformation in our present code of values
take place.
In this calculating and questioning age, a firm, demon
strable foundation is necessary for an enlightened
philosophy of life. Never before has there been a
greater need for such a philosophy than during these
days of war, and the need will be even greater in the
days of reconstruction after the War. All peoples will
then be seeking a new morality, based upon stronger
claims than traditional creedalism.

FOREWORD
The structure of our present civilization is based upon
laws determined by individual and sectional interests,
pregnant with injustices, begetting wars, revolutions,
and human suffering. In the past, peace efforts have been
conducted by strong sectional interests, with failure as
a natural result.
Peace and brotherhood, to be real, must be based
upon an insistent spiritual force, founded on knowledge,
recognizing the true perception of life and its purpose.
As prejudice recedes and the general acceptance of the
implications of survival advances so must our civilization
conform more and more to spiritual values, impelling
the reconstruction of our social, economic, national,
and international codes, developing life on the under
standing that human effort should contribute to the
peaceful, harmonious, and spiritual progress of humanity.
In other words, the aim must be to spiritualise the
world.
Thanks beyond expression are due to Mr. Webber
for his willing co-operation in the work, and particularly
so to his spirit-guides and workers for their great
patience and understanding. Sometimes weeks of work
on their part has been destroyed by our clumsiness —yet
they have never complained. It is only when one
continuously works with these spirit people that one
realizes their infinity of resource and they become as
personal as the closest of friends. No form of words
can adequately express the thanks that are due to these
wonderful people.
A tribute must be paid to Mr. Leon Isaacs, for his
work in applying infra-red rays to the photographing
of phenomena : and the help afforded by his perfection
of a practical infra-red light unit.
Thanks are also due to Mr. Maurice Barbanell, Editor
of the Psychic News, for assistance given on a number of
occasions, and to the Psychic News, the Two Worlds,

CHAPTER II
THE MEDIUM—JOHN BOADEN (JACK) WEBBER
JACK
WEBBER was born of Devonshire parents
at Loughor, South Wales, in 1907.
His childhood was as ordinary as that of most
children, although perhaps a little more irresponsible
than usual. His education was neglected during the
war years in the absence of disciplinary insistence upon
attendance, etc.
At the age of fourteen he commenced work in a coal
mine, and continued so working until 1936. During the
latter period Mr. Webber would be employed under
ground- during the day. Arriving home in the evening,
he would then prepare himself to sit for physical pheno
mena. This dual strain on his physical resources was too
great to continue, so the manual labour was given up.
In early manhood he was a cornet player in the Salva
tion Army band—his mother being a trenchant Salvation
Army worker—whilst his father was a bell-ringer in the
local Protestant church.
When Mr. Webber was about twenty-one years of
age he met Miss Rhoda Bartlett, whom he married in
1930. They have two sons, Denzil, aged eight, and
George, aged six.
Mrs. Webber belonged to a staunch spiritualist family
which, at the time when Mr. Webber first met his future
wife, were holding home circles for the development of
their psychic gifts.
Thankful appreciation should here be mentioned of
the patience and faithfulness of Mrs. Webber and Mr.
and Mrs. Evans (Mr. Webber's father and mother-in

law) for their painstaking work in developing Mr.
Webber, and their daughter Winnie (now Mrs. Rooke),
also a well-known healer, speaker, and clairvoyant.
To Mr. Webber, at the age of twenty-one, spiritualism
was, to use his own expression,
" bunk," nevertheless,
mainly in order to be with his fiancee, he attended the
home circle, and was thoroughly bored with the whole
procedure, invariably going to sleep.
At this period the circle sat for table phenomena, and,
as is customary at such circles, messages would be
tapped out. One evening Mr. Webber, still a sceptic,
tried to play a joke and manipulate the table to give a
false message. To his surprise a message was tapped out,
in spite of his mental and physical obstructive tactics.
A message which, more amazing still, told of the correct
place in which a lost handbag, containing money, would
be found.
This incident caused Mr. Webber to reconsider his
former opinion of the gatherings, and he began to take a
more sympathetic interest in the circles he attended.
Later on, through his Guide, information was given
for the finding of the body of a man who had been
missing for some days, mention being made of the actual
spot by a bridge over a nearby river. On another occasion
he told a friend of the passing of a workmate. They had
been working together that afternoon and had parted in
good health. His friend ridiculed the idea, but after
wards it was found to be perfectly true, as the man in
question had passed over at his tea-table during that same
afternoon.
The table circle was changed into a circle for the
development of control work, and after about two years
from the commencement Mr. Webber would sink into a
trance-like sleep.
The next stage in the development of the medium was
the control of the mind and body by spirit entities, the
latter being replaced later by the controls using Mr.
Webber for his present-day work. This development was

by no means easy, many tense moments being provided
by the violence with which the controls manifested
through the medium's body.
The spirit-guide in control of the medium during
seances is Black Cloud. In the early days he asked for
toys, musical instruments, etc., to be placed near to Mr.
Webber in the circle —trumpets, too, were soon added.
First of all slight movements and tappings were noted,
then development came quickly and levitation of the
trumpets and objects followed soon after.
It was suggested that Mr. Webber should sit in a
cabinet, but, to Mr. Webber's normal mind, to sit in an
enclosed cabinet was sufficient to induce a certain
amount of suspicion. Mr. Webber has never used a
cabinet—he prefers to be in the circle, as one of the sitters.
Ropes were used to secure him to his chair in the first
instance, and it is in this way that the mediumship has
been built up, providing a technique the spirit-controls
are accustomed to.
Researchers and others have often suggested other
forms of securing the medium, including strait-jackets,
sewing up in a sack, enclosing in a packing-case, etc.
Such suggestions have been resisted, mainly because they
would be a departure from the technique to which the
controls are accustomed, secondly, because the medium
should be protected - from fanciful experiments that
" bleed
" him, and finally because the use of a red
light combined with the precautions stated in the
following chapter are ample and sufficient.
Even during this stage of his development Mr. Webber
was still sceptical as to the powers being exercized through
him, and it was only after visiting other circles in the
district, when the same phenomena occurred, and were
testified to by independent sitters, that Mr. Webber
came to accept as actual fact his own psychic powers.
Very strong healing forces soon became evident,
mainly through a spirit-control known as Malodar (a
young Egyptian). Considerable healing work was under

taken, including the gathering of herbs and the making
of medicines therefrom. Mr. Webber relates how he
would be taken out into the marshlands and open
country near his home, in a semi-dazed condition, to
where the particular herbs grew, collecting them, and
then returning home and brewing them for a special
complaint. It was found that the healing work exhausted
the physical body, so with the development of the physical
mediumship the healing work was allowed to lapse.
Addendum. May, 1940.
Early in 1940, Mr. Stanley Croft (a member of the
developing circle) arrived one evening, deeply distressed.
His daughter, evacuated in the Westcountry, had been
admitted to hospital with severe blood poisoning, and
her life was despaired of.
Assistance was asked for through Mr. Webber's
Healing Guides, which they said they would give. Later,
during the same seance, the healing control, Malodar,
spoke through the trumpet and said that he had been to
the patient, and that he would again return and draw
the poison from her body. He also gave this evidential
information—the poisoning had been caused through the
sting of an insect in the head.
Up to this time, the cause of the poisoning had not been
traced, and the medical authorities had no knowledge
of the cause of the trouble. Mr. Croft wrote and inquired
whether such a sting could be traced. It was then
recalled that a day or so before the illness, a bee had
become enmeshed in Miss Croft's hair and had stung her
when it was being extricated. Neither Miss Croft nor her
mother had associated the sting of the bee with the illness,
and this evidential information proves the powers of
diagnosis, and which, of course, could not possibly have
been telepathy.
In a few days, all traces of the poison left the patient
and the recovery was complete.

THE MEDIUM —JOHN BOADEN (JACK) WEBBER 21
Most temarkable, was the manner in which healing oils
would be produced from the medium's hands. Mr.
Webber would stand by his patient in an entranced
state and thick oil would ooze on to his hands. So
thick were these oils that his hands presented the
appearance of having been immersed in a large can
of vaseline. The patient would then be massaged with
the oil.
The preparation of the medium for the work ahead
was not restricted to the developing circles. It continued
at night-time, when loud knocks would be heard, the
bed-clothes would be pulled off the bed, a bedside table
on which stood a paraffin lamp and other odds and ends
would tip over sideways and descend to the floor with
out any oil being spilled or an object displaced —and
then be righted again. Voices would be heard, and often
Mr. Webber would forcefully express himself, telling the
controls to leave him alone.
Gradually, as the years passed by, the powers de
veloped, voices in the trumpets, and independent of the
trumpet, became stronger. Heads and hands material
ized, and eventually the medium was prevailed upon to
give demonstrations before strangers, visiting on a
friendly basis the homes of neighbouring spiritualists.
Until quite recently Mr. Webber was afraid of these
phenomena. Generally, as soon as he sat for a seance
and the light was extinguished, and before Mr. Webber
went into a trance, there would be noises and the levita-
tion of trumpets, etc. These made the medium fearful
until the trance state took away his consciousness. How
ever, this fear is now disappearing, for in the developing
circle, in red light, voice and levitation have been
manifested before normality departs. At first these
phenomena were of a few seconds duration, and then
week by week they became gradually prolonged to from
five to ten minutes, consequently the medium can now
see a part of the phenomena, and is able to hear and speak
to his own controls.

22 MEDIUMSHIP OF JACK WEBBER
Mr. Webber is an unassuming man, unlettered, fond
of athletic sports, a keen dart player, and always willing
to help anyone in need of his assistance. Never yet has
any person been denied who needed the comfort of the
" return
" of their loved ones, even if they were unable to
pay as much as a portion of the usual fee. Mr. Webber
has co-operated with cheerful willingness in all efforts to
further our knowledge of the spirit people.
The following are some of the main spirit-controls
concerned in the present-day mediumship.
Black Cloud. A North American Indian of the Mohawk
tribe. He takes charge of the seance and is in direct
control of the medium's body. When Black Cloud first
made his presence known he could not speak English,
and left for a time to learn, through the medium, an
English vocabulary. It is to Black Cloud that we are
most indebted, both for his co-operation in taking
photographs and also for the considerate understanding
which he has shown and which has endeared him to
those who have had the privilege of co-operating in the
work.
Paddy. A boy control. He is one of the most active
workers in the seance, and is in control of the
" inner
"
circle. He acts as instructor to the spirit people who
desire to make their presence known, telling them the
way to use the ectoplasmic voice mechanism. He has an
exceedingly humorous turn of mind, but can be very
serious, especially when giving an explanation as to how
the phenomena are produced. Paddy sings in a thin
voice and has materialized many times. He is a constant
visitor to the homes of members of the developing circle,
recounting various incidents that have happened to them
during the day. A most lovable personality.
Reuben. A South American, schoolmaster by profes
sion, visited this country during his earthly life and passed
over from tetanus. In his early attempts to control the

medium was very violent, reproducing the physical
contortions of the disease from which he passed over.
He is a powerful agency in the circle work, and is
particularly noted for his strong singing voice, a rich
baritone, which has been recorded by the Decca Record
Co., Ltd. This voice is so powerful as to be of full loud
speaker strength, and is referred to in a later chapter.
Reuben also controls the medium for trance addresses
on the platform, but this work has been allowed to
lapse in order to conserve the medium's strength. He
has fully materialized.
Other controls are Malodar, the healer ; Talgar ;
Rev. John Boaden (a great-uncle of the medium) ;
Dr. Millar and Professor Dale, whose work is mainly
concerned with the materializations and whose earthly
existences have been verified from the data they have
supplied.

CHAPTER III
INFRA-RED PHOTOGRAPHY
THE
following is a simple non-technical descrip
tion of the method whereby the photographs
reproduced in this book have been secured.
All the photographs have been taken by means of
infra-red ray. By this means the lens of a camera is able
to record in the dark whatever is in existence, as clearly
and as precisely as a photograph taken in normal white
light.
The method adopted has been to flash a powerful
sashalite bulb housed in a light-proof cabinet. One
side of the cabinet is fitted with an infra-red filter.
The bulb generates from 100,000 to 150,000 watts,
and the period of the flash, and therefore the exposure,
is from one-fiftieth to one-seventy-fifth part of a second.
With this momentary flash of such tremendous power
only a very dim, dull-red light emission is seen by the
eye.
The cameras are loaded with plates sensitive to the
infra-red ray.
When the infra-red ray first became practical for photo
graphic use in the dark, it was said that it would expose
stance-room trickery. Through Mr. Webber's medium-
ship it has proved the genuineness of physical pheno
mena, and, by doing so, has provided evidence of survival
after
" death."
The infra-red ray is most suitable for this work :
firstly, because the radiations emitted are least harmful
to ectoplasmic formations, etc. (such formations cannot
be physically created in the presence of ultra-violet rays,

which are harmful to mediumship) ; and secondly,
because it is the only known process permitting photo
graphic records to be taken in darkness.
The rapidity of the exposure prevents the possibility
of collusion by any sitter with the medium, for any
change of position would be recorded.
As a general rule a number of cameras are positioned
in the room in order to obtain photographs from different
angles. Any person with a camera possessing a reasonably
fast lens can take the photographs.
The majority of these photographs have been taken
during the sitting of Mr. Webber's developing circle,
or at special photographic seances, when representatives
of the Press and other organizations have been present
in their official capacity, bringing with them their own
equipment. Occasionally they have been taken in places
which the medium has never before visited.
Generally the Guide, speaking through the medium,
gives the instruction when the photograph is to be taken,
and the operator in charge of the infra-red flash then
presses the switch. The camera lenses have meanwhile
remained open, awaiting the necessary exposure On
one occasion the press-switch to fire the bulb was placed
under the medium's hand, so that the Guide in control
of the medium could press the switch and so take the
photograph at the most suitable moment.

CHAPTER IV
THE SECURING OF THE MEDIUM
iHE general method of securing the medium is by
a rope, fifteen yards long, to a wooden arm-
JL chair of the Windsor pattern. On occasion the
rope has been provided by independent people. Some
times short lengths are used, with additional independent
tapes and threads to secure the arms and legs.
The tying-up can be carried out by any person present.
At the hundreds of public seances the roping has been
carried out by skilled tiers, sailors, policemen, and
psychic researchers, etc.
Further precautions employed are the sewing-up of the
ends of the rope, after tying, thus making it endless. The
ends and knots are sealed with wax and impressed with a
seal provided by any sitter. A piece of cotton or wool is
then tied at the base of one thumb, a piece of paper
threaded on through a needle-hole, and the other end
tied to the base of the opposite thumb. The value of this
precaution in demonstrating supernormal activity is
seen when two or three objects are in simultaneous
levitation, so wide apart from each other that it would
be a physical impossibility for the medium to accomplish
the movement normally with hands secured by a cotton
or a piece of fragile wool, fifteen inches long. The
distancing of the objects in levitation can be so wide
apart that no one person could manipulate both move
ments, even with hands quite free.
On a number of occasions at the London Spiritual
Alliance in 1939, a very long rope (the property of the
organization) was used, in which the roping was carried

out to plan. A reef-knot first secured the centre of the
rope to the back of the chair. The rope was then passed
round the body four times, and each time knotted at the
back of the chair. Each upper arm was twice bound and
knotted to the back strut of the chair, and the forearms
were bound several times to the arm-rest. The remainder
of the rope secured the medium's legs and ankles to the
chair legs. The ends of the rope were then sewn together
with strong thread, sealed with wax, and impressed with
a signet-ring. On these occasions (as often happens) the
ropes were tied just sufficiently tight so as not to impede
blood circulation. During the course of a sitting*(about
two hours) the arms and legs swell, so that by the time
the seance ends the ropes are pressing well into the flesh,
so much so that the rope-marks are visible hours after
the termination of the sitting.
At the sittings with the London Spiritual Alliance full
demonstrations were given, of which the following two
incidents are worthy of mention.
Mr. Webber was roped as above, his own rope being
left loose near at hand. During the seance this spare
rope was taken and the sitter next to the medium was
roped by unseen
" hands
" to his chair. The rope was
taken right across the circle and intertwined in the chair
of the sitter opposite, under the seat and round the chair
legs, the rope returning to further enmesh the first
sitter, the remainder being tied in a confusion of knotting
with no end visible. When the seance was over the rope
had to be cut to free the sitter and to free the rope from
each chair.
The second incident occurred on another occasion, the
medium being similarly roped. When the coat was
removed from the body while the medium's hands were
held by adjacent sitters, it was found that an elastic arm
let the medium wore above the elbow was outside a rope,
that is, the rope that had been tied over the coat in the
first tying up was underneath the elastic arm-band. To
do this normally, the end of the sewn and sealed rope

must have been freed, all knotting undone to the arm
band and then threaded through, the knotting and bind
ing restored and the ends sewn up, and sealed with the
signet ring of the sitter. Later on, when the coat was
returned to the medium's body, the rope was freed from
the armlet and left outside the coat as originally tied.
The Guide later explained that the armlet had been
dematerialized when the coat was taken off and remateri-
alized outside the rope ; when the coat was being
replaced the process had to be reversed to enable the
rope to be freed to be placed outside the coat.
Another method that has been used is to employ
" sensitive
"
roping, so that if the medium ever (nor
mally) freed himself from the ropes they would fall into
one loop, impossible to replace without assistance.
Repeatedly during seances the white light is put on
immediately before and after some phase of phenomena
requiring rapid action. Those who roped the medium
are invited by the Guide to examine the ropes, etc., to
see if they are precisely as originally tied. The roping
has never been found to have altered, and at the end of a
seance, whatever the phenomena may have been, it is
exactly as tied in the beginning. The report later on by
Mr. Colin Evans of one of our seances illustrates this
point in detail.
Roping, no matter how elaborately tied, is ineffective
to keep the medium in the chair, if the Guide wishes to
take him out of the bonds. This feat is one of the most
remarkable of those exhibited by the spirit people. The
modus operandi is as follows : the light is put on to show
the medium roped in the chair, the ropes and knots are
examined, and the light is switched off. The next one
hears is the instruction for
"
light
" which shows the
medium standing on the far side of the circle. The time
which has elapsed may be only a few seconds. The ropes
are seen to be resting on the chair as tied, even to the
crossing of one rope over another, in precisely the same
position as if the medium's body was within them. In

THE SECURING OF THE MEDIUM 29
considering this process it is interesting to remember that
as a rule it takes two people from two to four minutes
each to tie the medium in the ropes alone, and an appreci
able time to undo the knotting, sometimes longer,
especially when the knots are obstinate, than the time
taken to tie him up.
The return of the medium to the roped condition in
the chair is also a matter of seconds, from five to ten.
The medium is seen standing in an entranced condition
away from the chair. Before the light is put out, he may
be seen to be gyrating quickly. The light is extinguished,
and a slight sound may be heard. There is an immediate
call for light, and he is seen back in his chair, roped
precisely, to the minutest detail, as before.
A variation of the above is as follows :
The white light is put on and the ropings are examined.
Then two sitters are asked to hold the medium's hands.
The light is extinguished. The sitters linked to the
medium feel his hands fall over the side of the chair arm
and the medium rises to his feet, out of the ropes,
without exertion or jerkiness.
On several occasions the medium has been levitated
out of the ropes and deposited outside the circle of
sitters. The sitters are close together, touching each
other with their hands linked, in circle formation. The
medium therefore had to be levitated into the air and
carried over the sitters' heads to enable him to alight out
side the circle. Sometimes on such an occasion he may
be suspended in the air for a number of minutes, his
feet gently resting on the shoulders of a sitter who is
asked by the Guide to place his hands on them and to
feel up the sides of the legs. While the sitter is doing
this the ceiling may be somewhat violently knocked by
the medium's head and/or hands. The interesting
feature of this phenomena is that no weight is felt on
the sitter's shoulders. The medium is then brought to
the floor outside the circle of sitters. As a rule this takes
place at the end of a seance, and the medium is then

brought to himself —standing. When this occurs, the
ropes are left on the chair, and efforts are made by one
of the sitters to try and get into the roping. A lady and
the author, both smaller boned than Mr. Webber, have
unsuccessfully tried to place both arms and legs into the
fastenings. Struggling takes place for a number of
minutes, but even after taking the shoes off, no one has
yet succeeded in doing it. When one has been able to
get one arm in it was only by displacing the ropes and
rucking one's clothing. Rarely is it possible to get the
coat-sleeves under the ropes at all, and when the medium's
upper arm was bound to the chair the task of normal
re-entry was absolutely impossible. These normal efforts
made considerable noise, and it is noteworthy that when
the medium is returned to the roped condition in the
chair, all that is heard is one slight movement as the
levitated body comes to rest on the chair accompanied
by an immediate request for "
light."
In June 1939 three representatives of the British
Broadcasting Corporation were present. They were
Mr. Lot de Biniere, Director of Outside Broadcasts,
and Mr. John Snagge and Mr. Michael Standing,
Commentators. These gentlemen undertook the secur
ing of the medium. After he had been roped, the ends
of the ropes, knots, etc., were bound with cotton and
knotted. An extra length of cotton was tied by Mr.
Lot de Biniere round the outside of the medium's
forearm to the arm-rest of the chair, then tied round
the buttons on the coat cuff, carried straight in front
of the medium's body to the other side where the
opposite coat cuff buttons, arm, and chair were similarly
secured. During this seance the coat was taken off while
the medium's hands were held by two of these gentle
men, without the cotton being broken (examination
being made in white light immediately after the coat
fell to the floor). Later, the coat was returned to the
body with the cotton intact and knotted around the coat
cuff buttons as originally tied. At the end of a two

hours' seance, Mr. Lot de Biniere was asked to thor
oughly examine the cotton on the ropes and especially
that in front of the body, and he declared that everything
was exactly as originally tied. The Guide then asked
him to break the cotton in front of the medium, which
he did with negligible effort. This demonstrated how
the slightest tension on the cotton during the evening's
phenomena would have easily broken the strand.
Later experiments include the tying (after roping) of
silk threads, firmly and tightly around the wrists and
to the chair (knots underneath) and elbow to the back
of the chair (knots at rear). At the end of the seance the
silk thread was found to be embedded in the flesh of the
wrist owing to swelling.
In other chapters different methods of securing the
medium are referred to.
To those who still may consider that the medium may
possess a technique to permit his exit and entry from the
fastenings normally, there is a final aspect that forbids
that supposition. At the commencement of a seance,
immediately after the tying, the light is put out.
Within a fraction of a second one or two trumpets are
in levitation encircling the sitters. As the levitation ends
and the trumpets come to the floor, there is an immediate
request for light. The trumpets may have moved
several feet away from the medium and have come to
rest well away from his chair. Frequently in most
seances the trumpets are lying on the floor, in positions
where it is absolutely impossible for the medium to
touch them without getting out of the fastenings and
reaching down to pick them up. The almost instan
taneous switching-on of the light before and after this,
and other phenomena, illustrates beyond any possible
doubt whatever that supernormal means must have been
employed. The Guides have so perfected this rapidity
of action that trumpets are often seen moving as the
light goes on—and still more amazing, continuing in
motion for a period while the light is on. (See the

32 MEDIUMSHIP OF JACK WEBBER
description by Colin Evans of a seance, further on in
this volume.)
The main purpose of roping is the prevention of any
conscious or subconscious action on the part of the
medium, but it is also designed to satisfy the sitters
the medium is not consciously, subconsciously, or
fraudulently producing movement. The one aim of the
mediumship is to provide proof of survival through
supernormal action, directed by intelligences possessing
a greater knowledge than we have.
Special sittings in red light add further testimony to
the powers of the spirit people in manipulating forces
beyond human knowledge. In red light levitation has
been repeatedly observed —the medium meanwhile being
bound in his chair, while articles, trumpets, etc., are
moving round, up and down, twisting, turning, and per
forming all kinds of evolutions without any visible con
nection with the medium. Alternatively, the article is
seen sometimes in movement, strongly held by an ecto-
plasmic structure emerging from the solar plexus or other
part of the medium's body —the medium being seen,
quite still, roped in his chair. (See later chapter on
ectoplasmic structures.)

CHAPTER V
REPORT OF A SEANCE BY BERNARD GRAY
{Sunday Pictorial).
THE
seance reported took place on May 24th, 1939,
and occupied two pages of the Sunday Pictorial
dated May 28th, 1939.
Mr. Gray prefaced his report with an affidavit as
follows :
"I, Bernard gray, of 27, Barn Rise, Wembley
Park, in the County of Middlesex, Journalist, make
Oath and say as follows :
" 1. That my description of the incidents enumer
ated in the Article written by me hereunto annexed
and marked
'
B.G.' to appear in the issue of the
Sunday Pictorial of the Twenty-eighth day of May
One thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine under the
heading of '
I Swear I Saw This Happen
'
is true.
" 2. I further make Oath and say that the incidents
so described in such Article did occur in my presence."
This oath was sworn before a solicitor yesterday.
I bound him to his chair, hand and foot, with knots
and double knots which a sailor once taught me.
Just to make sure he couldn't wriggle out and back
without my knowing
it,
I
tied lengths of household
cotton from the ropes to the chair legs. And
I
sewed
up the front of his jacket with stout thread.

a Welsh miner. He's now a medium —a man for whom
such remarkable claims are made that I selected him for
my first test.
Through him, I was told, are performed some of the
most astonishing miracles of spirit power, physical
demonstrations intended to prove the reality of life
after death.
And in this, my second adventure into Spiritualism
during my association with the Sunday Pictorial, I want
physical phenomena.
Startling deeds, not words, as proof. Not testimonies
of people claiming to be healed, not messages from the
dead. Just material facts which a materially minded
man like me can grasp.
I want final and complete conviction. That is more
important to me than Hitler, the Axis, or even the threat
of war. And that is why I have asked the Editor to
allow me —for a while—to leave politics, and go in
search of Truth.
So we sat, fourteen of us, a cheerful, talkative group of
very ordinary people, in a plainly furnished room at
Balham, London.
There was a Metropolitan policeman. A consulting
engineer. A waiter. A postman. A foreman plumber.
Several women of various ages. And next to me,
between the medium and me, Mr. Harry Edwards,
leader of the Balham Psychic Society, by trade a printer.
We all held hands loosely, Mr. Webber settled himself
back as comfortably as my knots would allow, and out
went the light, leaving only a red bulb gleaming dully
through the darkness from the middle of the room.
Things began to happen immediately. They went on
happening with remarkable rapidity, with startling
variety, for ninety minutes.
But I do not want to recount them in order. For I
want to describe first two astonishing happenings which

make the rest seem small in contrast. Happenings
which I, personally, can only compare with the miracles
of the New Testament.
THERE WAS THE APPEARANCE, IN MID-AIR, SO TO
SPEAK, OF A PERFECT HUMAN FACE.
I am sitting, remember, only one removed from the
medium. An hour of the seance has gone by. The
early tenseness, the trace of excitement, which perhaps
affected me at the start has disappeared.
I am my normal, cool, and vigilant self—alert for any
sign of deception, accustomed to the eerie glimmer of
light we get from the red bulb near the ceiling.
In the corner, so near I can touch him, the medium is
breathing heavily, gulping occasionally, moaning un
easily at times, like a man with a nightmare.
Suddenly, he gurgles alarmingly, as if making some
still greater effort.
Before me rises a kind of tablet, rather like a slate,
and from the upper surface it sheds a luminous white
light.
I watch it intently, not in the least perturbed. I saw
it in its normal state before the seance started. An
ordinary piece of four-ply wood, about a foot long and
nine inches wide.
Now it hovers in front of the medium's face, its soft
radiance lighting his features so clearly I can see the
closed eyes and the twitching lips.
It moves gently down to his hands and I see quite
clearly that the arms are still bound to the chair.
" IT'S SHOWING YOU THE MEDIUM TO CONVINCE YOU
HE'S STILL IN THE SAME POSITION," MR. EDWARDS EX
PLAINS, IN A NORMAL TONE.
" AH ! YOU'RE REALLY
GOING TO SEE SOMETHING NOW !
"
The glowing tablet has moved over to me. It hangs
motionless so close to my face I feel that if I breathe hard
I shall blow it away.

36 MEDIUMSHIP OF JACK WEBBER
" Watch !
"
says Mr. Edwards, giving my hand a
squeeze.
Then above the tablet I begin to see something white
emerging from the darkness. Almost invisible at first,
it grows stronger every moment, like a motor car head
lamp advancing through fog ; until I can clearly see
it as a diaphanous ellipse, standing on its end, as it were,
on the tablet.
"
Ectoplasm," says Mr. Edwards.
" Watch closely
in the centre of it !
"
No need to tell me. My eyes are glued on
it,
though,
I
want to emphasize, I'm still cool and unemotional.
Now, framed in this luminous halo,
I
can perceive
dimly what appear to be features. They are becoming
clearer, easier to trace. There's the nose, and—yes —
the mouth. The eyes, and, my God
!
The eyelids are
moving.
The tablet moves still closer. The eyes, soft and
natural, are looking directly into mine.
I
jerk myself
back to
a
detached, inquisitive state of mind, examine
the thing in front of me closely and searchingly.
It's not like the pictures of spirit faces many of us
have seen in Spiritualist papers. It's not white and
unearthly, like the frame in which
it
is
set. rather is
IT A HUMAN FACE —BUT SOFTER, FINER, AND SOMEHOW
DIFFERENT.
I
can trace the cheek-bones fading back from the
eyes. The lips, they are quite clear. The chin, rounded
and delicate,
is
silhouetted against the lower rim of
the halo.
I
recognize
it
suddenly as the face of
a
very old lady.
Just like
a
lovely miniature —for
it
is
much smaller,
now
I
come to think, than the face of any human
adult.

REPORT OF A SEANCE BY BERNARD GRAY 37
There's a whisper. What is she saying ? Who is
she speaking to ? Yes —I've got it.
" MY BOY, MY BOY," WHISPERS A WOMAN'S VOICE,
IN THE TONE A WEALTH OF LOVE, OR MAYBE COMPASSION.
" Who's she speaking to ?
" I ask, without taking my
eyes off the face for a second.
" You," replies Edwards.
"
Speak to her !
"
" Who are you ?
" I ask, gently.
" I am——," she answers, and whispers a name I shall
not repeat —it is personal.
" I cannot stay," she goes on.
" I just want you all
to see me. God bless you, my boy . . ."
The tablet and its burden move away. I can see it
floating around our circle. Other sitters are exclaiming
that they can see
it,
quite plainly, that it's wonderful.
i'm glad i'm not the only one who can see it. . .

The tablet returns to me. The features in the miniature
are fading, like outlines yielding to the dusk of
a
summer
evening. Now the halo
is
going too.
Only the tablet
is
left. Its gleam disappears with
the suddenness of
a
light being extinguished. The
tablet falls with
a
clatter at my feet.

a
voice instantly.

grasp. The pressure tightens till it hurts. I set my
teeth and wait.
The medium is moaning like a man in pain.
I can feel a soft fabric rubbing against my wrist.
" Can you feel his coat ?
" asks the deep voice in the
corner.
" I can feel some kind of material on my wrist,"
I answer, readily.
" I am dematerializing his coat and taking it off."
Now the coat is rubbing the other side of my wrist.
Something drops to the floor with a light, rustling
impact.
" LIGHTS ON," SAYS THE VOICE SHARPLY.
Simultaneously, it seems, somebody presses the
switch.
The medium is in his shirt-sleeves. He is no longer
wearing his coat. Round his arms, over his shirt now,
are the ropes, still fastened by my patent knots.
The thin strands of cotton from the ropes to the
chair are unbroken.
On the floor, the medium's jacket. Not a stitch
holding the edges together broken. My twisted thread
round the button just as I had left it.
" That is merely intended to prove to you that the
spirit world exists and has power to dematerialize,"
says the deep voice in the corner, when the lights are
off again.
" Later I hope to replace the medium's
coat."
Half an hour later the lady on the other side and I
are asked to hold Webber's hands a second time. Again
the grip is firm enough to be painful.
A rustling. Cloth rubbing against my wrist again.
Yes, and now the other side.
Lights. Webber is wearing his coat once more.
Over and round each arm, the bonds. The cotton
intact. The thread just as before, but the bonds and

" And I felt
the coat go through my wrist. Didn't you ?
"
Well, those two happenings, or miracles —call them
what you like, take a bit of explaining away.
There were other things too. Heaps of them.
" I can feel a hand on my head," said Mr. Edwards,
casually, just as if it were quite a natural thing for a
hand to emerge from nowhere.
" I can feel something on my head," I said a moment
later, and gripped Edwards's hand more tightly to
make sure it hadn't been raised.
Something was pulling my hair pretty hard. I realized
then with a sense of shock that the
"
something
" was
definitely fingers, yet rather different from human fingers.
They felt sharper, more like claws, seemed almost
metallic at the tips.
My neighbour chuckled.
" I know what they're doing," he said, highly amused.
The fingers pulled me firmly by the hair in Edwards's
direction, till my head was touching his. My hair was
pulled and twisted about for fully a minute.
" We're
being tied together," said my neighbour, laughing.
" Can't you feel your hair being twisted with mine ?
"
We were tied together, too ! We couldn't separate,
and the seance was held up for a moment or two while
the lights were put on so that we could be unravelled.
" A mischievous trick," said everybody else, laughing
at our plight. Mischievous, all right. Inexplicable, too.
I'll swear nobody moved before, during, or after the
knots were tied in our hair.
Frequently throughout the proceedings the luminous
trumpets were shooting about the room three at a time,
with the speed and accuracy of swallows in flight.

ing them," I said boldly, though I myself considered it
impossible.
One of the trumpets shot straight at my head with the
speed of an express train, pulled up sharp just as it
touched my temple, and I cringed expecting a knock-out
blow.
That tin cone proceeded to run itself on my face and
round my head, pressing first the broad end, then the
narrow end, against my lips to prove it had no earthly
connection at any point on its surface.
A bell which I'd seen on a table in a corner rose into
the air and rang a rhythmic accompaniment to our sing
ing. A pair of clappers, similar to those used by a
dance band drummer, floated about clacking merrily
in time with the music.
In a powerful bass voice, which has been recorded on
gramophone discs,
" Reuben
" led some of the singing.
Toys in the room, illuminated by a strange incandescent
glow, leapt from the table and sailed about near the
ceiling.
A boy, I was told, plays with the toys —a boy who
died some years ago.
As something moved off the table and began to dart
about the room, Mr. Edwards explained that it was a doll.
Whatever it was, it settled on my knee, and frolicked
up and down my leg. I could feel it as well as see it
glowing, like an outsize glowworm. It came to rest
finally on my knee. And when the lights came on, I
found that it was indeed a toy elephant, such as any
child would use in play.
You see, therefore, it wasn't a gloomy gathering by
any means. The strange pranks with the toys —a
clockwork engine wound itself up and ran itself down
near the ceiling —distinctly enlivened the proceedings.
All these little things, however, paled into insig
nificance beside a remarkable demonstration of furniture
removing by unseen hands.

CHAPTER VI
CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF A STANCE BY
COLIN EVANS, B.A.
I
ATTENDED a group seance for physical pheno
mena with Jack Webber, on Monday, February 27th,
1939. I was particularly alertly observant and more
analytical and critical than, in my own experience as a
medium, it is usually advisable to be (owing to the
unhelpful mental radiations resulting from such an
attitude).
The only two sitters who might be supposed to have
personal association with the medium or whom even a
hostile sceptic might suspect of collusion, were Mr.
Harry Edwards, the head of the Balham Psychic Research
Society —under whose auspices Webber sits —and Web
ber's father-in-law. These two gentlemen were at points
in the room most remote from the medium —the former
at the very opposite end of the room, the latter in the
diagonally opposite corner furthest from Webber, where
the electric light control is. No phenomena occurred
near enough to either of these gentlemen for it to be
physically possible for them to play any part in
it,
and
at no time,
by
any possible means, could either of them
have left his position without the full knowledge of half
the independent sitters. Neither of these gentlemen had
any part in the roping and tying of the medium or the
stitching of his coat.
I
sat by the door in the fourth seat from the medium.
This seance was held in darkness.
I
scrutinized very closely the tying of the medium's
arms and ankles to the chair
by
rope. Two men did

this, and the knots tied and the tightness of the tope
were such that no "
escape
"
trickery was possible that
would permit of getting back into the ropes without
obvious disturbance of them. They cut closely into the
flesh, and the muscles of arms and ankles were immov
ably secured to the solid wood of the chair, so that
absolutely no movement of the feet or of the arms above
the wrist was possible ; and I made special note (without
drawing attention to
it)
of the exact angle at which two
looped portions of rope crossed one another under the
forearm. Even had it been possible to slip the arm from
this rope, and later to put
it
back,
it
would have been an
utter and complete impossibility to arrange precisely the
same angle of crossing of the rope there, except by using
both hands to do so, and to be able to see clearly while
doing
it
—and therefore an utter impossibility for the
medium himself to achieve, in light or in darkness, or
for any other person to accomplish in the dark.
Before he was tied in the chair, his coat was stitched
all down the front so that
it
was an absolutely tight fit
that could not possibly be taken off or put on again,
even
if
his arms had been free, without undoing the
stitching.

examined the stitching, and noted

the medium's hands where he was seated. First one

trumpets simultaneously a moment later. The direction
in which each trumpet pointed and its angle and the
position of the unilluminated narrow ends could be
quite accurately judged from the luminous portions
owing to the distinctive shape of the luminous paint on
the aluminium.
They rose vertically till the broad ends were about
three feet from the floor, then tilted over horizontally,
and, mostly with the narrow ends towards the medium,
moved freely in all directions away from him to distances
of seven or eight feet (from the nearest part of the
medium's chair to the broad ends of the trumpets,
leaving about five or six feet between the nearest part of
the medium's chair and the narrow end of the trumpets),
but occasionally turned completely round and moved
equally freely with the broad ends pointing towards him
and the narrow ends away from him. No mechanical
device of the nature of a rod or tongs could have
produced this effect by any human possibility.
They repeatedly tapped firmly on the bodies of the
sitters, including myself, and on the medium's own head
and body, and later in the seance soared to the full height
of the room—about twelve or thirteen feet —knocking
against the ceiling in the middle of the room, and
against the walls at considerable distances from the
medium, and sometimes at such distances from one
another that no one person could simultaneously have
been manipulating both trumpets, even if free to walk
about and stand on chairs or the like.
Repeatedly the medium's control called for

"
and every time the light was switched on instantly, and
as it was switched on the trumpets would sink with a
fairly rapid movement, but not so rapid as a falling body,
unsupported, towards the floor, and when the light was
on the trumpets were usually just reaching the floor, but
still in movement, and continued moving for a moment
or two —once for almost half a minute —with gentle
movements, obviously intelligently controlled, on the

floor —not rolling on their curved sides, but

"
as it were on their broad flat ends.
Every time the light was in this way flashed on sud
denly, the medium was seen to be still securely roped
and tied with the knots and the exact angle of the crossing
loops of rope so undisturbed as to prove that he had not
even been twitching restlessly as a medium in trance
often does, and this within a small fraction of a second
of movements of the trumpets at a distance from his
body that could not have been normally manipulated
unless he had been free from the ropes. His hands were
empty and there was no possibility of his having con
cealed any mechanical device for moving the trumpets
at a distance.
Two luminous plaques were, first separately and then
simultaneously, levitated in the same way as the trum
pets, and levitated to a position, once, where their light
shone clearly on the motionless and helplessly-tied-up
medium and neighbouring sitters, showing their com
plete independence of the medium's and sitters' bodies.
Incidentally all sitters' hands were linked throughout the
seance. These plaques or luminous slates fell flat to the
floor after each levitation of them, at considerable dis
tances (from four feet and upwards) away from the
medium's chair. Several times the moment the light had
been switched off again, the flat luminous-painted slabs
of wood in question rose immediately from the floor in
a way that would not have been possible normally
without some person reaching down to the floor to pick
them up or using tongs or some such device to reach
them, and when there had been no time even for a person
not tied or held or restrained or controlled in any way
to make such movement.
I satisfied myself that the least movement in or from
his chair, or of his chair, even tilting or tipping it in any
direction, would make a clearly distinguishable sound —
and no such sound was heard at any time during the
seance. .

A tambourine and some bells were visibly (all lumin
ous) and audibly levitated and
"
played
" at heights of
seven or eight feet from the floor and in the centre of
the room, six or seven feet from the medium, floating to
that position from a table near the medium's chair
instantly on light being switched off, and remaining in
motion at the distances mentioned up to the very moment
of light being switched on again. This occurred
repeatedly, as did every phenomenon produced.
Two pairs of castanets or clappers, also luminous,
were levitated to the centre of the room and to a height
of some ten feet—nearly to the ceiling —and for about
three minutes played in strict time and tempo, very
strongly, to the rhythm of the sitters' singing. These
dropped to the floor from " mid-air
" at the moment of
light being switched on.
Once, the very instant light was switched off after I
had scrutinized the undisturbed tying of the medium in
his chair, and while all sitters' hands were linked,

cheeks and rested on my forehead and the back of my
head, or tapped my shoulders and my knees. Ladies on
both sides of me reported the same thing, and so did
sitters all round the room—once or twice this pheno
menon was reported simultaneously from widely separ
ated parts of the room.
A lady, whom I know very slightly, but whom I
definitely know to be a regular and experienced fee-
paying sitter with many mediums when she is in England
(she is not English and is often abroad), and who can
hardly be suspected of confederacy, reported child hands
clasping hers. As she was linking hands with two other
sitters (strangers) at the time, one of these gentlemen
also felt the child's hands simultaneously on his own.
The child then spoke in the direct voice. Its name was

declared had never manifested before and who she
also declared was not known of as having ever existed
to the medium or sitters in the seance.
Two dead friends spoke to me in the direct voice
through the trumpet. Neither of them gave absolutely
arguable evidence of identity, but I feel satisfied that I
knew them both. Their voice and intonation and
manner of speech differed from one another and both of
them from the mediumln a way that to me was absolute
proof of the complete impossibility of mimicry, and the
voices were clearly within a few inches of my face, and
could not have issued from the medium's lips without
at least six people knowing he had left the chair to which
he was roped. The messages showed evidential know
ledge of health conditions of my own which are not
obvious and not public knowledge nor, as far as I can
tell, knowable by Webber.
Another lady was spoken to, at an even greater dis
tance from the medium, in the same way by a spirit who
gave the full christian and surname of Phyllis Gunning,
which she accepted as evidential. This name was not
mentioned until a spirit uttered it.
Other sitters also received in direct voice what they
accepted as good personal evidence. Voices and accents
were well differentiated.
After the medium had been inspected and his ropes
and knots and stitched coat had been examined in full
white light, the light was switched off and afterwards
switched on again. The medium was seen to be still
tightly and securely roped in his chair, the rope (includ
ing the evidentially exact angle at which these two loops
crossed under one arm, which the medium himself could
not have seen or rearranged even had the rope been
loose enough for him to get his arms free and replace
them) undisturbed —his coat was off. The stitching of
the coat was examined and was undisturbed. The light
was switched off again, and on being switched on again
he was again wearing the coat, the sleeves being perfectly

straight and smooth to a degree impossible if his arms
with the coat on had been pushed through the loops of
the rope which cut tightly into his arms through the
coat-sleeves. The time taken for the coat to be put on
again wis approximately five to six seconds.
Intermittently, light rain of real objective cold water
fell on sitters' faces.
Finally, the table which stood slightly behind and to
one side of the medium's chair, and in front of which two
trumpets, both luminous, were standing, was levitated
to the centre of the room without obscuring the view of
the two luminous trumpets. The table would have to
have been lifted over to have brought it there normally.
The trumpets never moved. To have lifted the table
normally from its original position to the middle of the
room without knocking down or hiding the trumpets,
it would have been necessary for a man to stand and lift
it five or six feet in the air, over the heads of the seated
sitters.
In two hours of physical phenomena there was not one
thing that I did not eye with the critical scrutiny of a
sceptical investigator —and not one thing failed to con
vince me that it was, and only could have been, wholly
supernormal in its nature.

REPORT OF A SEANCE BT
" CASSANDRA
"
{Daily Mirror)
THE
following report occupied the best part of the
two centre pages of the Daily Mirror on February
28th, 1939. Cassandra
" is the pen-name of a
gentleman on the staff of the Daily Mirror who writes a
daily pertinent review on matters in general. He is well
known for his cryptic and biting sarcasm, and has, on
numbers of occasions, given full vent to his opposition
to spiritualism.
The seance in question was held in North London at a
place to which the medium had never been before, and the
people present were complete strangers. Mr. Leon
Isaacs had been asked to take infra-red photographs.
The problem arose as to the means of transporting the
equipment, and since
" Cassandra
" had a car, he was
asked to help this way. Thus the only reason why
" Cassandra was present was because he possessed a
car.
The article was illustrated by a photograph (Plate
No. 20), with the following description beneath it :
" The medium in a trance, lashed to the chair, while a
table leaves the ground and books

that's a powerful load of scepticism these days. I
haven't got an open mind on the subject—I'm a violent,
prejudiced unbeliever with a limitless ability to leer
at the unknown. At least, I was till last Saturday. And
then I got a swift, sharp, ugly jolt that shook most of
my pet sneers right out of their sockets.
" Picture to yourself a small room in a typical
suburban house. In one corner a radio-gramophone.
In the centre a ring of chairs. At the far end an arm
chair.
" About a dozen people filed in and sat in the circle.
I hope they won't mind my saying
it,
but they struck
me as
a
credulous collection that would have brought
tears of joy to
a
sharepusher's eyes.
" Almost everyone a genuine customer for
a
lovely
phony gold brick.
" They sat down and the medium,
a
young Welsh
ex-miner, was then roped to the arm-chair. The
photographer and
I
stood outside the circle. The
lights went out and we sailed rapidly into the unknown.
" The medium gurgled like water running out of
a
bath, and we opened up with
a
strangled prayer.
" The circle of believers answered with
'
All Hail
the Power of Jesu's Name,' and
I
was told that we
were
'
on the brink.'
I
thought we were in Cockfosters,
Herts, but
I
soon began to doubt
it
when trumpets
sprayed with luminous paint shot round the room like
fishes in
a
tank. They hovered like pike in
a

CHAPTER VIII
THE REMOVAL AND REPLACING OF THE COAT
A
FREQUENTLY performed phenomenal feat at
stances is the removal and replacing of the
l medium's coat, while the medium is helplessly
bound to his chair.
The preliminary preparation for this occurrence may
vary in two ways.
A piece of thin cotton, the breaking strain of which is
very slight, ties the top button of the coat to the button
hole. Any slight strain on this cotton would snap it.
Alternatively, the two sides of the coat are sewn down
the front, body-tight, extending from the revers of the
coat to the skirt. Fancy stitching can be employed and
the cotton knotted and tied round each button. Some
times the coat has been sewn so high up to the neck that
an aperture of only six inches diameter has been left.
The medium is then secured to the arm-chair as
previously described.
Early in the seance, immediately after some of the
other phenomena, such as the levitation of articles,
the members of the circle sitting on either side of the
medium are asked by the Guide to hold the medium's
hands. Then, within one or two seconds, the coat is
heard to fall as it is either thrown on the floor or on to a
sitter's lap. Immediately after this there comes the request
for " Light !
" There is no delay whatsoever between the
falling of the coat and light being switched on.
The light shows the roped medium's hands still held
by the sitters. The coat is examined and there is not the
slightest variation in the stitching. To conceive of the

coat being unstitched, removed, and then re-stitched
is a fantastic impossibility.
Plates Nos. 3 and 4 show the coat partially removed.
It will be seen that while the head and shoulders are still
within the coat the arms are outside the sleeves. In
attempting to reproduce this condition normally, con
siderable bunching of the coat at the shoulders could not
be avoided. In the photographs the entire absence of
bunching should be noted. Several other factors should
be taken into account when considering these pictures :
firstly, that when the coat has been discarded, the roping
on the medium's arms does not vary by the smallest
fraction ; secondly, the time factor between action and
immediate light ; and thirdly, there is no sound of
movement during the coat's removal.
Plate No. 5 shows the coat entirely removed from the
body and ready to be discarded. It will be noted in these
photographs that the medium's hair is undisturbed, and
this is invariable.
Plate No. 6 shows the coat discarded while the
medium's hands are secured. (The gentleman holding
the medium's hand is Mr. Harold Sharpe, the well-
known medium in whose seance room the sitting took
place.)
Plates Nos. 8 and 9 show the method whereby the
coat is removed by dematerialization. . The National
Spiritualists Union badge can be seen in the lapel. If
an article is left in the coat pocket, especially letters,
these are found at the medium's feet when the coat
has been removed, owing to the article not having
been dematerialized. This photograph is more ex
tensively dealt with in the chapter,
" The Astral
Head."
A report by Mr. A. J. Case, President of the Cam
bridge Research Society, published in the Psychic News
on August 1 2th, 1939, bears witness to the demateri
alized condition of the coat in transit from and to the
body.

54 MEDIUMSHIP OF JACK WEBBER
Mr. Case writes :
" One of the most baffling things was the removal
and replacement of Jack Webber's coat while his hands
were held on each side.
" While holding his hand, I felt a substance almost
like a cobweb on my wrist, which appeared to get
more solid till it assumed the consistency of cloth.
It seemed to have no weight. After a few seconds it
slid gently to the floor. The light went up instantly,
and there sat the medium minus his coat. Both the
coat and the ropes were examined and the stitches and
knots found intact as before."
The Dean of Trinity College afterwards said
" wherever the power came from he was quite satisfied
that trickery was impossible." Prince Deo and his friend,
who had had considerable experience of the occult in
India, said that
" fraud was out of the question."
(Psychic News, August 12th, 1939.)
The coat is placed on the floor somewhere near to the
medium (within six to eight feet). The Guide will
again ask two sitters to hold the medium's hands, then
says he is going to try to replace the coat. The sitters
holding the hands often feel the coat, free of the body,
being lifted up preparatory to its replacement. Within a
very few seconds comes the call for light when the coat
is seen back on the medium's body under the ropes.
The stitching and roping are again examined, and they
are found to be precisely the same as originally tied.
The time factor is again important; —as a rule five seconds
only between the coat being felt free of the body, and
the light showing its replacement.
There are two items that should be mentioned. The
first is that during the time the coat has been off the
body, the arms have swelled so that the ropes are
pressing tightly into the flesh. The author, has, with
others, been asked to note the tightness and has tried to
move the ropes a fraction, but so tight have they been

that any movement of them was not possible. To insert
a coat-sleeve under the ropes was almost an impossi
bility and could only have been normally achieved after
a very long struggle —if it were possible at all. Secondly,
when the coat has been returned under these very tight
ropes, there is not any rucking or bunching of the sleeves.
The chapter on " The Securing of the Medium
" deals
with this phenomenon, when cotton was tied and
knotted round the medium's coat-cuff buttons.
The first time this phenomenon was photographed
(the technique of holding the medium's hands has been
developed since) Mr. Maurice Barbanell, the Editor of
the Psychic News, was present, and in reporting the
incident he wrote :
" These photographs are a challenge to materialistic
science, for they demonstrate what is regarded as the
'
impossible.'
" The removal of a coat through ropes —this means
that either the coat or the ropes dematerialized to
allow matter to pass through matter . . . proves the
existence of a psychic law which materialists refuse to
accept.
"
Jack Webber, a
'
physical medium,' was securely
roped to his chair, the knots being threaded with
black cotton which normally would snap if interfered
with.
" Black cotton was also tied around a button and
knotted through a button-hole of his jacket, so that
the slightest movement on his part would have
broken them. Yet all these knots and threads were
intact at the end of the seance.
" The removal of the coat and its reappearance in
its original position could not have been done by the
medium. None of the sitters was responsible, as they
were all controlled, everybody linking hands with his
neighbours.
" The feat was accomplished by an invisible
intelligence. Whose was it ?

Conjuring is out of the question. No magician
could have emulated this happening, under the same
conditions, nor at the speed with which it was accom

six seconds for its replacement.
" Fraud is out of the question."
The following extracts are taken from an article
published in Light (page 427-428, 1939), written by
Mr. B. Abdy Collins, CLE., well known for his books
and writings on psychical research.
"... I wish to draw attention to one phenomenon
which is quite in a class by itself and cannot be ex
plained; they are explained by those who accept the
facts, as caused by psychic rods or voice boxes emanat
ing from the medium and directed by his sub-conscious
mind.

and replacement of Mr. Webber's coat. In order that
its importance may be clearly appreciated, I will

sewn up all down the front with a needle and coarse
thread by one of the sitters. He then sits in an arm
chair into which he is securely bound. The middle of
a long piece of rope is fastened to the back of the chair
and Mr. Webber's arms are tightly tied to the arms
and his legs to the legs of the chair. This is effected
by two sitters each taking one end of the rope and
winding it round and round his limbs and the chair
arm and leg, securing it with knots here and there and
finally bringing the ends of the rope together, when
they are sewn up and sealed in several places. . . .

asks for the light to be turned on, and there is Mr.
Webber sitting bound in his chair as before, but his
coat has been removed with the stitches in front
intact. It may be lying on the medium's knees or
on the lap of one of the sitters. After any examination
the sitters wish,

Black Cloud
'
announces that he
will replace the coat, the two sitters grasp the medium's
hands and the light is switched off. Very soon,
'
Black
Cloud
'
calls for light and Mr. Webber is found sitting
in the chair, his hands still held, and the coat on him
again as it was at first.
" The facts are undoubted. They have been
'
witnessed,' if that is the proper word, by many
hundreds of persons. I myself have twice

seen
'
the coat removed in this way and once

replaced. The coat is removed while Mr. Webber's
hands are held, his arms are tightly bound to the arms
of the chair and the front of the coat is closely stitched
together. It is not a conjuring trick. How is it done ?
The only explanation seems to be that the coat is
'
dematerialized
'
in some way, or else that matter
as represented by the coat is passed through matter
as represented by Mr. Webber. Anyway, this is a
phenomenon which cannot be explained by invisible
psychic rods, or
'
pseudo-pods.' Apports brought into
a closed room have been explained in much the same
way as I have suggested, but our sceptics get over this
simply by denying that any case of an apport is properly
substantiated. Here they cannot deny the facts.
If they refuse to accept the testimony of others, they
can easily verify the facts themselves. What '

can they offer.
" If nothing will induce them to accept the spiritist
hypothesis, then at least they must admit that some

it seems less absurd to ascribe these activities to

than to try to explain them by the activities
of the medium's subconscious mind. The latter
hypothesis seems to get us nowhere. It does not

This phenomenon is also testified to in other
descriptions of seances.

Plate No. 7. This photograph was obtained on
February 28th, twelve days before the passing of
Mr. Webber, and was the last secured.
The first photographs secured dealt with the coat
phenomenon, and the last deals with the same subject,
providing a mystery-picture that can only be described
as "impossible."
For some months, work in the developing circle had
been directed towards the manifesting of materialized
forms in red light and the removal of the coat and the
more general forms o£ the physical phenomena had not
been encouraged. No other apparatus was brought into
the circle except the trumpet and the luminous plaques.
The coat was not sewn up, and had not been interfered
with for a considerable time. Roping was always
employed.
During the sitting came the request for photograph,
and after the exposure was made the Guide said it would
show the coat with the sleeves under the ropes, while
other parts Of the coat had been
" removed."
The photograph shows a position that it is impossible
to reproduce, even normally, with one coat. The
members of the circle have spent some time trying
to reproduce normally what the photograph shows,

and a general invitation is extended to the public to
reproduce it.
Examination of the photograph under magnification
shows that the pattern and texture of the coat is identical
throughout.
It will be observed that the coat-sleeves are on the
arms under the ropes, the shoulders and lapels of
the coat are in their proper position, but the back of the
coat is draped across thefront of the body.
The author affirms most definitely that Mr. Webber
had only one suit of this pattern, that only one coat was
present at the seance, and that it was impossible for a
second coat of such precise pattern and texture to have
been in the room.
Before the author had time to change the plates and
light bulb, there came a request for a second photo
graph. As the apparatus was not ready, this was lost.
Immediately after this the coat fell to the floor> the white
light was put on, and the coat was examined. It was
quite normal.
The only possible way in which the position depicted
in this remarkable photograph can be normally repro
duced is with two coats or extra material. With two
coats there is so much bunching that a reproduction
becomes a caricature of the photograph.
There is one logical explanation of how this feat was
accomplished. For the coat to be shown as photo
graphed it must be in two parts, and the suggestion is
made that using the process of dematerialization the
Guide separated the back part of the coat from the
collar downwards, and reformed it in the position
shown.
When discussing the photograph with Mr. Webber,
he put forward the thesis that the back part of the coat
was first dematerialized and brought through the body
(as an apport is produced through the body) and re-
materialized in front of him.

precise method employed by the Guide, the author
suggests that the former thesis is supported by the
piece of cloth hanging down below the abdomen, which
may be the top part of the back of the coat where it
joins the collar, especially as in this portion the lining
and a seam, consistent with this theory, is shown.
In the attempts to reproduce normally this position,
a second person to drape the coat was essential, and the
experiment occupied some considerable space of time,
with attendant noise. For the medium to reproduce
normally the position from a roped condition and to
return to a roped condition would be absolutely im
possible.
If trickery is contemplated, all the persons present
must have been implicated, since collusion would be
impossible without the knowledge of all sitters. In a
subsequent photograph taken later at the end of the
sitting, the roping was portrayed precisely, even to the
crossing of the ropes, etc., as shown in this picture.
Thus we are faced with a photograph of a position,
impossible to reproduce, that must have required
super-normal powers beyond human capacity.

CHAPTER IX
THE PROCESS OF APPORTING OBJECTS
ON
only one occasion has the process of apporting
objects been photographed.
Only on rare occasions have objects been
apported through Mr. Webber's mediumship. The
following is the narrative of events that led to the
securing of the photographs referred to.
The occasion was a public sitting, at which about
eight members of the Temple of Truth, Paddington,
were present, on November 8th, 1938. The following
quoted description was signed as an accurate description
of the incident by Mr. James Sing, President of the
Temple of Truth.

Webber on November 8th, 1938

this room to show we can bring objects through
walls and doors."

this."

Three photographs are printed (Plate Nos. 10, n, and

The bird and ectoplasm can be seen near the medium's
solar plexus. No. 11 is an enlargement of the area
concerned. On No. 36 is a picture of the apported bird.
It will be noted that this event was produced in
accordance with a plan stated beforehand. First, by
Paddy, who told the sitters what was intended, and
who was seconded by Black Cloud who foretold what
would be on the photographic plate before it was
developed. Here is signal evidence of extraneous
intelligences operating laws unknown to human beings.
The brass ornament is three and three-quarters of an
inch high and weighs two ounces. This object was
definitely passed through the wall and/or door of one
room into another. To achieve this, the ornament
must have been rendered into a dematerialized condition

of a vibration so high that it would pass through solid
obstacles as sound passes through a brick wall. In this
condition it passed through the medium's body and
rematerialized on emerging. The ectoplasmic state at
the emerging doubtless is an essential factor for the
rematerialization, as is necessary for all forms of material
izations.
This process, demonstrating that apported objects
have to come via the medium's body, is consistent with
the usual procedure of apport mediums, who are able
to produce apports, using a trumpet for their delivery.1
The trumpet is connected to the medium by an ecto
plasmic arm as in Plate No. 12. The apport in its
dematerialized condition travels via the medium's body
along the ectoplasmic arm into the mouth of the trumpet,
where it is materialized ; the trumpet acting as a con-
server or retainer for the ectoplasmic force and the act
of materialization.
On a later occasion the apporting of two objects was
witnessed in red light. For some hours before a seance
when apports may occur, Mr. Webber feels a tightness
of the abdomen and is therefore able, at times, to know
what is intended. On the occasion referred to, he had
these symptoms, and therefore he invited a search to be
made of his person, which was carried out by a member
of the circle (Mr. S. Croft), a member of the Metro
politan Police Force, in the seance room before all the
1
The method of apporting objects via the medium's body is
not applicable to all apport mediums. The author was present in
April, 1940, at a sitting with another medium, where apports were
received by a different process. On this occasion the trumpet,
previously shown to be empty, was taken to the ceiling, to receive
the apport (in this case a glass vase). The explanation from the
Guide is that the object is transformed into a vibratory state, and
contained in an etheric envelope. The object is then rematerialized
within the trumpet. Another apport produced on this occasion was
a finely engraved seal, which rematerialized while the trumpet was
describing circular movements of amazing speed—at first faint
tappings could be heard in the rapidly moving trumpet, gradually
becoming stronger as the materializing process was completed.

sitters, just previous to his sitting down for roping.
He did not leave the presence of the sitters, but immedi
ately sat down for roping. The red light was on,
sufficiently bright for all to see the medium with his
arms bound to the chair. Trumpets were in levitation—
also clearly discernible in the red light —one of these
turned round, presenting its large opening to the solar
plexus region and an object was heard to fall into it.
It then came to the author who was asked to take out
of the trumpet the article within. —an Egyptian orna
ment. (See Plate No. 36). After a minute or two the
trumpet again travelled to the solar plexus and another
object was heard to fall into it. This, too, was taken out
of the trumpet by the sitter to whom it was presented
(Mr. S. Croft). See Plate No. 36 in this case, a stone
Bhudda. It will be seen from the photographs that the
size of the objects could not have been hidden from
an experienced searcher. Furthermore, all the eleven
persons present saw the medium tied to the chair and
the trumpet which had a second before been in very
violent levitation move to the medium's body, when
the article was heard to fall into the trumpet. Ectoplasm
was not seen at the time of emergence of these two
objects. This is easily understood since the process
was being executed in red light and ectoplasm is in its
strongest form or highest vibration when invisible.
Plate No. 36 also shows an apport produced the week
previous to the above incident, but this was produced
in darkness, and pinned directly on the lady's dress, to
whom it was given (Mrs. G. Layton).
At seances elsewhere, apports are occasionally pro
duced. On one occasion a coin commemorating the

Gordon Grahame) said he had been in that State in that
particular year. At the same seance, a lady received a

would be given to her.

to attend a sitting with another medium at Luton when
this medium wired that he could not be present owing
to illness. The organizer, Mr. Gordon Grahame,
telephoned Mr. Webber to ask if he would sit, so that
on this occasion there could not have been any pre
conceived action on Mr. Webber's part, and the lady
who received the crucifix came from Bedford —a com

CHAPTER X
THE ASTRAL HEAD
THIS
photograph is one of the most remarkable yet
secured, for here has been photographed for the
first time, and physically, an astral or spirit head.
The photographer (Mr. W. J. Clayton) was not a
spiritualist, and the only reason he was present at the
seance was that he possessed a camera. This camera was
of the box type and fixed to an ordinary though some
what rickety tripod.
This photograph is so important that consideration is
given to the possibility of error on the part of the
photographer or complicity on the part of the medium.
The question of a double exposure is ruled out by
the precision of the sitters as well as the body of the
medium. It should be borne in mind that a period of
several minutes, with the white light on, occurred
between each exposure (the flash bulb had to be changed
and plates withdrawn and new plates inserted). The
rickety state of the photographer's stand was also an
item that would have prevented such precision if it had
been a double photograph. It is not credible that a
sitter could so precisely retain or resume a posture so
photographically exact.
The photograph was taken at an exposure speed of
one-fiftieth of a second, by sashalite flash. Knowledge
of the number of exposures made and the recording on
the other plates in the camera, prevents the theory of
double exposure remaining tenable.
If it were possible for the medium to register these
two distinct impressions, he would have to have done

so within a fraction of the fiftieth of a second exposure
without movement, leaving each image to register pre
cisely on the plate. Also he would have had to have
judged the changing of his expression to coincide with
the precise fiftieth part of a second during which the
flash occurred —an obviously impossible feat.
Thus, there can be no other conclusion than that the
two faces were in physical being simultaneously during
the exposure.
The Guide has said that the outer face is
" the spiritface."
It is impossible to suggest any other reasoned state
ment as to what the outer face can be, and it therefore
remains that this must be the astral or spirit counterpart
of the medium. Further examination of the photograph
supports this view.
The inner face is not Mr. Webber's normal face but
shows a transfiguration by the Guide, a tenable thesis
when the astral body is outside the physical body and
the Guide is in control.
The outer face is a perfect face, devoid of expression.
It should be noted how the chin of the astral face stops
short where it meets the lapel of the coat, showing the
harmony of density between the dematerialized coat and
the astral face.
The alignment of the two faces is precise, but whilst
it can be seen that the eyes and mouth are in line, the
ears are not, which indicates that a rotary motion is
necessary for one head to join the other. This rotary
movement provides evidence that the two heads are
three dimensional, that
is,
it
is
not one face super
imposed over the other, and
is
further evidence that the
picture
is
not the result of
a
double exposure.
There
is
not
a
physical head in existence.
The rear part of the inner head
is
in
a
state of partial
dematerialization, as
is
seen by its transparency. The
darker part within the two heads
is
where the two heads
merge, bringing the total density of the two heads to
normality.

68 MEDIUMSHIP OF JACK WEBBER
The astral head possesses breadth, as evidenced where
the strand of hair on the astral head is shown over the
hair of the inner head. This may be more readily under
stood if the rotary motion of the merging of one head
over the other is taken into account.
This photograph was obtained primarily in order to
illustrate the dematerialized condition of the coat when
being removed or restored to the medium's body. (See
chapter VIII :
" The Removal and Replacing of the
Coat.")
It provides proof of the thesis held by spiritualists that
each person possesses, while in the physical condition,
an astral body, which leaves the flesh at the time of the
physical death, to continue in a
"
spirit
"
sphere of activity.
Since this photograph was taken, there have been
further incidents in Mr. Webber's developing circle that
bear out the ability of the Guides to dematerialize the
physical body. The first incident occurred in a good red
light, when the medium's head, hands, and arms were
seen to have vanished. The sitters near by were able to
look down into the cavity formed by the neck part of
the clothing and only a black void was to be observed.
Mrs. Webber, who sat near to the medium on this occa
sion, was rather alarmed at the condition of the medium.
On a subsequent evening, in a duller red light, one
not sufficient to see the medium as clearly as on the
above occasion, the Rev. Maurice Elliott and Mr.
Byerley of The Link, who were present, were invited by
the Guide to feel the space where the medium's hands
and arms should be roped to the chair. They were not
there and the Rev. Maurice Elliott slid his hand up inside
one of the medium's coat-sleeves, but could feel no arm
there. Then the medium's hands and arms returned
almost instantaneously.
This chapter is a recital of facts without elaboration ;
much could be written upon the implications of this
photograph, and the importance of being able to provide
a physical photograph of the spirit body.

CHAPTER XI
LEVITATION OF THE MEDIUM
PART
of the demonstration of psychic power given
at seances is the levitation of the medium —who is
throughout bound to his chair —from the place
where he is sitting to another part of the room or hall.
Several attempts have been made to photograph this
phenomenon, but without evidential success.
The process involves the lifting up of the medium
with his chair into the air, where he often stays for a
number of minutes, and then depositing him in a place
as far from his original position as the room or hall
allows.
At times during such levitation the medium's feet are
felt travelling round on the heads of the sitters. When
there has been some light present, such as a luminous
spot on the wall or perhaps where there has been a
dull emergence of light through a curtain, the body in
the chair has been seen in suspension. On occasions in
halls where the roof is high, not only is it clear from the
sound of the voice that the medium is high up, but
evidence is provided of the levitation by the movement
of light fittings that could only be reached with a
ladder.
Further, when the table has been previously levitated
out into the room, the medium is deposited with only
the smallest margin of room between the table and the
sitters to spare.
This phenomenon usually takes place at the end of the
seance when the floor space before the medium is
occupied with luminous trumpets and other objects,

70 MEDIUMSHIP OF JACK WEBBER
these precluding any possibility of the medium attempting
to wriggle the chair and himself from one position to
another.
The following is an extract from a letter dealing with
the levitation of the medium, published in the Two
Worlds, February 24th, 1939, by Mr. J. W. Byerley,
Chairman of The Link :
". . . Twenty-four sitters were around the walls ;
white light on ; Webber securely bound in his chair ;
three-foot-six-inch table obliquely across centre of
circle, leaving only a narrow gangway between sitters ;
luminous trumpet on floor at sitters' feet, half-right
inclined to me. Lights put out —my eyes were on
trumpet. If the medium passed between my eye-level
and the floor, it would blot out the trumpet. He did
not pass ; no sound of medium moving (I was sitting
next but one). Control's voice heard from ceiling ;
well to my left a gentle bump on the floor. Light put
on—medium still tightly roped.
"
Admittedly it is possible for the medium to wriggle
across the circle whilst bound in his chair, but to do
this under the prevailing conditions, he would have
to come forward two feet, turn to the right three or
four feet, and then pass between the table and the
sitters, which could not be done without bumping the
table or sitters, and there was no sound of a moving
chair. The total distance he would have to cover
would be fifteen feet, an absolute impossibility in a
few seconds without noise. . . ."
Quite often marks from the medium's hair (from the
hair preparation he uses) are seen upon the ceiling.
Plate No. 25 illustrates an unusual happening. An
attempt had been made to photograph the levitation,
when by some means the power necessary to lift the
medium was reversed. The sound of the chair coming
down was heard, and then a continued grinding and
cracking of considerable volume. When the light was

put on, the medium was found tied to the wreckage of
the chair.
The Windsor chair that he occupied was very strongly
constructed. The seat was one and a quarter inches
thick and this was broken right across in two places
while the chair legs were forced out, as were the stays,
and the arm-rest was broken away from the back. The
photograph taken at the moment of breaking up clearly
shows what is occurring. Please note the entire absence
of strain or tension in the medium's body.
It is worth while to consider the amount of force
necessary to break up a chair so completely. It is doubt
ful whether a very strong man could, by lifting and then
smashing the chair down, break it as described. Remem
ber the medium (as photographed at the moment of the
smashing up of the chair) is in a roped condition, pre
cluding, of course, any such collusion. This photograph
is indicative of the tremendous forces brought into being
by the spirit operators.
Addendum. March 1940.
On February 26th, at a seance given at the Inter
national Institute for Psychic Investigation, levitation
took place. In descending, one of the rear legs of the
arm-chair into which the medium was bound, was placed
through a cross-stay of the table, which had previously
been levitated to the far side of the circle —another
impossible human feat, in total darkness, without noise,
and definitely proving that the medium in his chair had
been suspended in the air.

CHAPTER XII
TABLE LEVITATION
THESE
photographs show tables in levitation.
In each case the tables are well in front of the
medium, though owing to the head-on focus
they appear to be nearer to the medium than they actually
are.
The table in Plate No. 23 weighs over 45 lb., and was
very highly polished.
" Cassandra
" refers to this
incident in his description of the seance as requiring a
"
husky
" man to lift it. If this table was resting on the
cushion, it would show indentation marks.
Comparison of the cushion on which the medium is
seated, with that in Plate No. 21, shows that the cushion
is depressed. This record testifies to the theory of
Professor Crawford that the weight levitated is returned
through the medium.
Plate No. 24 shows the table in levitation in front of
Mr. Bernard Gray of the Sunday Pictorial (the reason why
Mr. Gray is seen crouching is that the table a moment
before had been dancing on his head and shoulders).
On other occasions while the table is levitated high
in the air, a trumpet also rises and hits the table all round,
to demonstrate that the table is indeed floating in the
air.
Addendum. March 1940
On February 19th, 1940, at the International Institute
for Psychic Investigation the table was levitated, circled
round, and touched the heads of sitters, and finally
descended with such force as to break the leg of the
table completely off.

CHAPTER XIII
TRUMPET PHENOMENA
MR.
COLIN EVANS describes in his report,
with some detail, trumpet movements.
The Guides have now brought their tech
nique between trumpet movements and light to a perfect
state. If the one who operates the white light responds
immediately the call for light comes, the trumpets are
seen in movement as the light goes on, these being well
away from the medium helplessly bound in his chair.
As the light is put out the trumpets ascend at once.
They are often lying on the floor, yet this makes no
difference, since they rise with force as soon as the room
is darkened.
Four trumpets have been seen in simultaneous levi-
tation. The best trumpet movement is with two trum
pets. One may be at one end of the room and the other
at the further end. One trumpet may be in the air
knocking on the ceiling, while the other sweeps the floor.
Tall people are unable either to hold up a trumpet so
high as is accomplished in the seance or with both arms
extended span the distance between the trumpets. May
it again be stressed that, for such a movement to take
place within a split second of light being put on, with
the medium still entranced, bound in sealed ropes, with
knots fastened with gummed tape or wax, provides
incontrovertible evidence of spirit power.
In the red light, these movements are still more
interesting, for the trumpets are then clearly seen to be
floating about the room without visible means of
control.

74 • MEDIUMSHIP OF JACK WEBBER
Trumpets in levitation will move as requested by the
sitters, turning completely round as if on an axis, first
with the narrow end towards the medium, then with the
broad end, and so on.
The trumpet will weave its way round the heads of
the sitters, going past one side of the head with the
broad end outwards, turning round the back of the head
and coming back with the small end foremost, going to
the next sitter in similar manner, and so on round the
circle.
The speed at which the trumpets travel is phenomenal,
band of light. At times they travel so fast that the eye
cannot follow the movement even in the restricted area
of a room.
To see two trumpets, moving at such a speed, weaving
intricate patterns one with the other without ever
hitting each other, provides an amazing spectacle.
It is often the case that there is an electric light pendant
or a length of flex hanging from the ceiling in the centre
of this trumpet activity. Only once has the electric
fitting been smashed or the flex pulled down, though the
trumpets in fast movement will suddenly slow up and
gently touch the pendant.
Again the rapid movement may bring the trumpet to
within a fraction of an inch of a sitter's nose, so that the
wind caused by the movement is heard and felt.
Repeatedly the trumpet will do this in front of a sitter,
then flash away to caress gently the face of another
sitter on the opposite side of the room. The control of
the trumpet is perfect.
For any person normally to execute such movements
in total darkness without hitting a sitter or a hanging
object would be an obvious impossibility.
To exhibit such controlled movement considerable
energy must be present. This is evidenced by the marks
that are made on the floor or linoleum when the trumpet
sweeps the floor in large arcs.

TRUMPET PHENOMENA 75
Plate No. 22 (the trumpet has been outlined) shows
the trumpet in movement close to a sitter ; so rapid was
the movement that the flash of the bulb was not fast
enough to enable a precise trumpet to be photographed.
On this occasion, the press switch to flash the exposure
was tied to the arm of the medium's chair, and the
Guide, through the medium, is pressing the switch with
a finger, thus taking the photograph.
One phase of this phenomena that often causes
apprehension on the part of a sitter is that the trumpet
returns with great force, hitting the medium on his
head. The Guide explains this as the return of a
psychic rod, carrying the trumpet back with it to
the medium.
On other occasions, for reasons not yet known, the
medium has been unmercilessly beaten on the head with
the trumpet continuously for some moments, the trum
pet swinging with tremendous force and crashing down
on the head. At one time a long heavy trumpet made of
stout tin was in use and this would beat the medium's
head. If a person were normal, surely he would soon be
beaten into unconsciousness.
So terribly severe have been these beatings that the
author could not believe, in the beginning, that the
trumpets could have hit the head so hard —he believed
they must have been hitting the wall. After the sitting,
the wall was examined and there was not even the
smallest indentation of the wallpaper.
At the next sitting the author was invited to place his
hand sideways on the medium's head, while the trumpet
crashed down upon
it,
to demonstrate that the trumpet
did come in contact with the head.
After such events,
it
is

neither bruise nor bump on the medium's head,

. . . and it is still another mystery of the spirit people,
how they are able so to protect a body from ill.
In this connection it is interesting to note that medical
men who have been invited to take the medium's pulse
while in trance, have declared it to be between 90 and a
100 —an appreciable acceleration. One doctor gave
the opinion that it would be likely to prove fatal for
such a pulse rate to be maintained for two hours, which
is the usual duration of a seance.
The respirations have also been taken, and found to
be nearly double the normal rate.
When a two-piece trumpet has been used, it has
sometimes become separated, the two ends being widely
apart. At one time, one end was outside the circle
behind the sitters. This end was brought up behind the
sitter, passed over the head and reunited with the other
end. This separation and joining together has been
observed on a number of occasions.

CHAPTER XIV
ECTOPLASMIC STRUCTURES
THE
photographs referred to in this chapter are
ectoplasmic structures physically constructed
for various purposes. The following chapter
dealing with voice boxes is closely connected with these
structures and both chapters should be considered
together.
It is desirable that definitions should be clearly under
stood. The term
"
psychic rod " has been generally
applied to all such forms of ectoplasmic emanations.
The photographs obtained, and very close observance of
the various forms of phenomena in which a force
external from the medium is employed, now definitely
permit of two main classifications, i.e.,
"
ectoplasmic
arms
" and
"
ectoplasmic rods."
The structures photographed are ectoplasmic arms.
Nevertheless, it is not possible to draw a distinct line
between an arm and a rod, as an arm can be instantly
converted into a rod when required.
The function of the arms is to act as a
"
power cable
"
for the construction of voice boxes, either in the trumpet
or attached to the medium. In the latter instance the
arm is used to convey the sounds from the voice box to
the trumpet for amplification. These formations are also
used in the process of apporting objects, conveying them
in a dematerialized condition through the
" arm
" to
the trumpet, where rematerialization is effected.
When at times these arms have come in contact with
sitters they have been felt to be soft and flexible, slightly
warm and coarse in texture. They are able to grip

objects (Plate No. 14 shows the gripper-like tentacles
at the end of the arm). When an arm lifts a trumpet or
other light object, the control of the object is weak.
In Plate No. 1 5 the arm had been connected to a trumpet,
a second or two before the exposure, but the control of
the trumpet was too weak to hold
it,
and
it
fell to the
floor
by
the side of the sitter. The author has at times
helped the trumpet to rest on his lap for photographs by
gently raising the knees so that the trumpet would not
fall off. These photographs provide corroboration for
the descriptions of similar
" tubular
" or
" ribbon
"
formations with " sucker-like
" tentacles at the ex
tremities, witnessed through the mediumship of Rudy
Schnieder.
The possibility must not be overlooked that levitation
of an object may be assisted
by
a
rod which
is
withdrawn
immediately prior to an exposure.
On several occasions the ends of the arms have been
illuminated. By
a
very high vibration the extreme tips
of the arms are shown as
a
blue ring of light. It
is
important to mention here that the light
is
in
a
ring
formation with
a
dark centre. (See
" Voice Production.")
When this phenomenon has been produced there have
been two such lights, which move about in a controlled
manner. Firstly, they are shown near the solar plexus,
then they move out away from the medium to the sides,
forward, and above his head. When the Guide has been
asked to elevate them they have risen above the head, and
when asked to move them forward, they have moved
forward, and so on. At one sitting the illuminated end
descended in
a
circular movement to the mouth of a
trumpet standing just in front of the medium. The
trumpet rose in the air and moved freely round the
sitters
;
the blue light being seen the whole time at
the trumpet's mouth. Finally, the trumpet was returned
to the floor and the blue ring of light was seen to rise
from the trumpet and return to the solar plexus in an
arc-like movement.

ECTOPLASMIC STRUCTURES 79
Quite different is the function of the ectoplasmic
" rod." This is used for strong movement and for the
levitation of heavy articles. It has not yet been possible
to photograph one of these
" rods." The Guide (Black
Cloud) has given the following reason for this. Rods
are often invisible and cannot therefore be photographed.
If the rods were to be brought into a physical condition
they would appear as shafts of light ; if the vibration
was still further reduced to create a physical object, it
would simply photograph as an ectoplasmic arm. The
emission of" the infra-red ray and the very dull red glow
that accompanies
it,
" dissolves
" the rod instantly.
It must, however, be placed on record that rods have
been seen by sitters. In the many and varied conditions
under which seances are held, there has at times been
a
slight degree of daylight seen through the general
darkness where
a
window has not been covered with
a
thoroughly opaque material. The general darkness
created was sufficient for the Guides to work in, but to
eyes attuned to the darkness
a
less dense black area
is
observable under these conditions. When this situation
has existed and objects are in levitation, passing over
this area,
a
strong thick straight structure
is
seen
attached to the object in levitation, the circumference
of which may vary from three to six; inches.
The less dark area
is
at times
a
fanlight, and the
levitated object being so high in the air
it
would be
absolutely impossible for the medium to have secreted
a
sufficiently sizable piece of mechanism about his person
to accomplish such
a
levitation.
On other occasions, luminous objects may be on the
floor, and the rods can be seen, as described, against the
lighted surfaces.
At one sitting the author saw, against
a
very dimly
illuminated area lit up
by
the glow of luminous paint,
a
rod extending from the ceiling straight down to the far
side of the medium. This looked like

but this structure was perfectly straight and precise, the
edges being as clean-cut as a rule.
Again in a very dim red light a structure has been
seen by all sitters emerging from the solar plexus region
as thick as the trunk of a medium-sized tree about
eight to ten inches wide at the base close to the body and
slowly tapering off to where the trumpet joined it.
Experience in sittings has given further knowledge
of these rods. When a trumpet has been temporarily
rested upon the lap of the sitter, three or four places
removed from the medium, and is again taken into use,
the rod has been felt across the linked hands or knees of
the sitters. It is felt to be rigid and extremely strong,
as may be gathered from the downward pressure that
the sitters in question have experienced. It can best
be likened to a rod of iron.
These rods are capable of very great strength. At
times a trumpet has been pressed against a sitter, forcing
him back into his chair in spite of every effort to resist.
A solid mahogany table so heavy that it takes two
people to lift
it,
has been taken from
a
corner of the
room and deposited in the centre of the circle. At
a
Christmas Tree Party for spirit children held at the
Balham Psychic Society, at which sixty people were
present, the tree had been fastened into
a
wooden crate.
The crate was nailed to the floor with eight-inch nails
through pieces of timber four inches thick. The tree
was also nailed with similar nails to other pieces of four-
inch quartering which, in turn, were nailed to the sides
of the crate. The tree was further wedged in with wood,
etc. At the end of this seance, after almost every toy had
been played with, musical instruments played in harmony
with the singing, clockwork toys wound up and set
working, and every toy on the tree had been taken off
(there were over
a
hundred toys), the tree was wrenched
out of the fastenings, pulling up the floor-boards in
doing so, levitated to the skylight, where
it

pulled off the brown paper that had been fixed to make

the church light-proof, and finally gently descended in
the dark, crowded hall to rest between two sitters. This
Christmas tree was ten feet high.
Rods used in a seance for levitation of objects are
straight, and movement is the same as would result
from movement of a ball-and-socket joint.
The gripping of objects by the rods is instantaneous ;
one object may be in levitation and deposited, and as the
act of deposition takes place, a second object nearby
may be immediately raised with great vigour.
The levitation of the medium to considerable heights
and distances in halls, etc., also indicates the strength
of the psychic power used.
Although the use of rods for levitation is the main
method used, the movement of objects in a seance is
not confined to this means, as may be seen by referring
to the chapter on Materialized Forms, Heads, Hands, etc.

CHAPTER XV
VOICE PRODUCTION
THE
production of a spirit-voice, unassociated
with the medium's vocal organ, takes place in
a "voice-box" produced in ectoplasm or by
other means.
The photographs show the ectoplasmic formations
housing the voice mechanism. The Guides inform us
that a replica of the medium's vocal organs are built in
the structure. For such a physical formation to be
built up with Mr. Webber, a complete trance state is
essential, and the Guides' instruction must be accepted.
When photographs have been secured of voice-boxes
through other mediums, they show a similarity of
structure.
Plates Nos. 18 and 19 bear a very close resemblance
to photographs of voice-boxes obtained in New York
some years ago through the mediumship of Mrs. Margery
Crandon. It is noteworthy that, when similar photo
graphs are taken with a number of years intervening in
places as far apart as London and New York, through
different mediums, with different controls, prima facie
evidence exists of a common fund of knowledge from
which the Guides are able to obtain instruction.
It is definitely established that voices do emanate
from these formations, as is proved by the hearing of
weaker-toned words in the immediate proximity of the
medium, while at the same time the words are being
loudly produced by amplification in the trumpet a
considerable distance away from the medium, the

dim voice resembling the volume of sound one hears
from a gramophone sound-box disconnected from the
amplifier.
Proof that the spirit-voice cannot be the product of
the medium's vocal organ lies in the fact that, while the
spirit-voice is speaking, the Guide can often be heard
speaking through the medium's throat simultaneously.
Further evidence that voices must be produced
through a mechanism external to the medium is demon
strated when two spirit conversations are taking place
at the same time in different parts of the room, while
the Guide is also using the human throat. Thus one
often hears three voices, each distinct in its tonal quality
from the others, simultaneously.
When such phenomena are produced the trumpets
carrying the spirit-voices are on each side of the room
and the source of the voice at these times lies within the
mouth of the trumpet, so that the voice mechanism is
constructed very near to or within the trumpet mouth
—the trumpets being connected to the medium by an
ectoplasmic arm and held by an ectoplasmic rod.
Voices so obtained are termed the
" direct voice."
Voices are frequently produced, clearly and dis
tinctly and without the use of a trumpet ; these are called
"
independent voices." No specific evidence has yet
been obtained to indicate what mechanism is used for
the independent voice.
The photographs show, in each case, that the voice-
box is either attached directly to the medium, or by an
ectoplasmic arm. An arm also connects the voice-box
to the mouth of the trumpet.
The sounds created in the voice-box have to travel
along the ectoplasmic arm to the trumpet for amplifica
tion. Our knowledge of how the sound so travels is
not conclusive. The probability is that the ectoplasmic
arm is tubular. Another alternative is that the ecto
plasmic connection possesses a quality that carries
sound waves, which are again translated into audibility

by a mechanism such as a diaphragm constructed in
the trumpet.
Evidence in support of the thesis that the ectoplasmic
arms are tubular is seen on Plate No. 14, where just
above the grippers a mouth-like orifice is seen, present
ing an appearance of hollowness throughout the arm.
The statement in the previous chapter that when the
ends of these arms were illuminated, they appeared as
rings of light, gives further support to the contention that
the arms may be hollow. The Guides also speak of
" hollow rods."
Definite statements can be made as to the way in
which sounds are produced through the voice-boxes.
As the replica of human vocal organs are reproduced,
so is a wind-instrument created, requiring a current of
air to vibrate the mechanism.
When a vigorous, loud, and sustained voice is heard
coming through a trumpet, the sound of air emission can
also be distinguished, consonant with the deep breathing
of an orator. This is particularly noticeable with a strong
singing voice.
The method by which the air current is directed
through the voice-box has not yet been ascertained. It
may be {a) passed through the medium's body ; (b)
travel from the body via the ectoplasmic arm ; or
(c)
emanate from the atmosphere adjacent to the medium.
As regards the latter,
it
should be remembered that
a
phenomenon common to most forms of physical
mediumship
is
that strong currents ofair are experienced,
sometimes of great force. These currents of air come
from the proximity of the medium, and curtains are
blown horizontal to their fastenings. They are much
colder than the general atmosphere. Therefore the
possibility exists that the current of air required to
create sound may be obtained from
a
source external to
the medium.
More tenable
is
the thesis that the air current
is
supplied through the medium's body to the voice-box.

VOICE PRODUCTION 85
This is confirmed by the statement above that respiratory
sounds are heard with vigorous singing. Furthermore,
as apported objects and ectoplasm can be emitted through
the physical body so could a volume of air be trans
mitted. This need not interfere with the operating of
the human throat by the Guide in control, which is often
heard speaking while spirit-voices are also present.
A feature of Mr. Webber's mediumship is the singing
of hymns and ballads through the trumpet or in the
independent voice. One control, Reuben, possesses an
extremely powerful voice, so strong that at times
the trumpet is in a condition of tension, setting up
such a high vibration that it takes on a ringing tone.
At all times the direct voice is of full loud-speaker
strength, possessing a quality of tone that is distinctive,
and which the medium is incapable of reproducing.
Each syllable is clearly articulated. If the medium could
produce this singing voice normally, he could obtain a
good living on the concert platform without endanger
ing his life and health at public seances.
Reuben has sung continuously for an hour without
cessation, with such vigour that any human throat
would have become exhausted and hoarse. His render
ing of hymns has been recorded by the Decca Record
Co., Ltd.1
Clearly too, but without such force, Paddy (a boy
control) is often heard, as is also the rich contralto voice
of a lady, and other spirit singers. A phenomenon
(impossible for human agency to reproduce) is the
singing of Reuben and Paddy at the same time through
the same trumpet —one voice a powerful rich baritone,
and the other a thin piping voice. When these controls
sing, the voice-box is definitely built in the small end
of the trumpet. The trumpet is generally well away

from the medium, six to eight feet high, and a similar
distance in front of the medium. The origin of these
voices lies within the trumpet. It is interesting to
remember that the diameter of a trumpet's mouth is
half an inch, and after use this end becomes battered and
bent so that the orifice is partially closed. Under such
conditions no human mouth could possibly use such a
mouth-piece and produce the perfectly formed words of
a hymn, slow, deliberate and perfectly enunciated.
Reuben has also revealed a comprehensive knowledge
of acoustics and the technical knowledge necessary
for recording his voice through the microphone —he
was responsible for giving instructions as to where
the microphone should be placed and positioned
the trumpet to avoid distortion. On one occasion,
when Mr. Hugh Millar was recording the voice, the
trumpet in use was a two-piece one, producing a vibrant
effect. Reuben discarded the trumpet and sang as
clearly and as strongly in independent voice. No
human throat could produce the resonant vibrant tone
that is heard when Reuben sings.
It is not intended to give here details of the evidential
nature of messages received —let it suffice that voices are
heard with every kind of intonation and dialect ; speech
in foreign tongues has been given to visitors from other
lands and conversations maintained in that tongue.
Voices of men, women, and children are distinct, and
the conversations display an intimate knowledge of
family events that are personal to the sitter and the spirit
communicant.
Our knowledge of the manner in which an indepen
dent voice is produced is limited. All that can be said
here is that such voices are heard speaking clearly with
out trumpets, without physically constructed voice-
boxes, in either darkness or white light. Independent
voices have been obtained through other mediums with
out the need for those mediums to go into a deep or
even partial trance.

VOICE PRODUCTION 87
On occasions when the medium has had a mishap,
and is unconscious, with bleeding, and doubt has been
felt as to the treatment or procedure to be adopted, and
the light has been on, the voice of Black Cloud or Paddy
has been heard giving instructions, the voices originating
some feet away from the medium.
On one evening, when Mr. Webber was away from
home, Paddy's voice was heard speaking softly yet dis
tinctly in three different rooms of the house. He was
beard by people in each room, uttering the same words
at the same time.
Addendum. March 1940
On February 10th, at Lincoln, a conversation was
carried on via the trumpet in French. On January 27th,
at the Sanctuary of St. Andrew, Harringay, conversations
were carried on in Swedish, Portuguese, and a recital of
Latin was given. The sitter who carried on the Swedish
conversation said there was no trace of an accent foreign
to the tongue. It may be re-emphasized here that Mr.
Webber was an unlettered man, he rarely read a book,
in fact, his only reading matter was the newspapers and
children's comics.

CHAPTER XVI
ECTOPLASMIC MATERIALS
THE
ectoplasmic formations referred to in the
photographs have been repeatedly produced
in a reasonable red light, all sitters observing
the phenomena. In dark seances, the process of
emitting ectoplasm is often illustrated by means of
the illuminated plaques.
The process is as follows : the medium's body is bent
forward whilst in the ropes, so that his head is over his
feet. From the mouth there commences to emerge a
substance that to the eye looks like heavy vapour. As
it emerges, it
" unrolls
" and pours down in front of the
medium's body to the floor. At the same time it con
tinues to pour out from the mouth, like a cascade, until
there is a considerable volume on the floor, spreading
for several feet each way. The emergence is rapid and
the process of emission only occupies a few seconds.
There is no noise from the medium's throat during this
time.
Rapidly, in two to three seconds only, the vapourish
mass condenses or becomes concentrated, until there
hangs from the mouth a length of material-like substance.
The texture of this material varies according to the
conditions prevailing at the sitting, and the condition of
the medium himself. When conditions are good, the
texture is very fine and close. When the conditions are
not so good the material is coarser and rents may be
seen in the fabric. (See Plate No. 27, where a rent is
visible.)
This material has often been handled, under the

Guide's instructions, by the author and other sitters. It
is moist, though not very wet, and possesses a peculiar
odour. On a number of occasions the author has been
invited to unravel the material and open it out. To do
this, however, extreme care has to be taken. The width
of the material, when opened out, is wider than the out
stretched arms of one person. Whilst unravelling the
ectoplasm at a sitting, the author was unable to stretch
it out to its full extent, and the assistance of the next
sitter was allowed by the Guide. The full extent must
have been two yards or more.
Plate No. 34 illustrates an occasion when sitters were
permitted to take hold of the ectoplasmic material, and
they were asked to open it out and hold it up so that a
better idea of its area could be photographed. On
occasions such as these sitters are a little nervous of
causing harm, and here apparently they did not use their
two hands ; the photograph, however, serves to show
the considerable length of material produced.
The return of the ectoplasm is instantaneous. The
author has had gentle hold of the material one moment,
and within the second that followed, the material has
been whisked away with a sound like the twang of a
piece of elastic and it has disappeared.
On the occasion when the photograph, shown by
Plate No. 29, was taken, a red light was burning, and
the sitters saw this voluminous material passing back
into the medium in a fraction of a second —one moment
it was visible, and the next it had disappeared. Follow
ing the re-absorption of the material by the medium, a
gulping throat action is heard.
Several descriptions of this material have been given
by sitters, as
" closely woven silk of a rich quality
" ;
" like wet toy balloon rubber
" ; "a wide piece of thin
seaweed."
This formation has no pattern, such as
" net." It is
like a skin rather than a woven fabric. It is distinct from
the ectoplasmic drapery that enfolds a materialized form.

90 MEDIUMSHIP OF JACK WEBBER
This drapery is most gossamer-like, and is so light
that its texture is as a spider's fine web. Each strand is
composed of thirteen to fifteen minor strands, which are
interwoven four times around each side of the square
forming the net pattern, and the size of the square is
about the size of a pin's head : impossible to humanly
produce.
The author has been told that the formations, as
photographed, are composed of cells, and that they
possess nerves and capillaries and are therefore
sensitive.
Whatever form ectoplasm may take, it is obviously of
human content —it proceeds from the living body and
returns to be absorbed into the body. It must therefore
be living matter.
This ectoplasm is the basis for materialization of
spirit people (see chapter on Materializations), though
from observations taken whilst with Mr. Webber, it
is not clear what form the ectoplasm is in, to enable
spirit people to use it to manifest themselves.
One of the controls (Dr. Miller) has given the follow
ing information : first the ectoplasm is produced, then
the controls mould it around the etheric body of the
spirit visitor, who is able to draw from the ectoplasm
that power to materialize the etheric body. In doing so,
the body becomes as physical as in earthly life, with the
various organs also materialized. Thus the materialized
etheric form is able to speak, etc.
At one sitting, ectoplasmic hands were seen to travel
to the red lamp, take hold of
it,
and detach
it
from the
ceiling hook. The bulb had
a
controlling switch in
the fitting enabling
it
to be turned on and off at will
by the spirit-controls. On this occasion the bulb was
held, illuminating the ectoplasmic material, showing its
texture, semi-transparent, and the complete absence
of weaving marks —no threads or cross-threads were
visible.

ous plaques, its texture is shadowy and does not show
clear, defined edges. An ectoplasmic rod was shown
this way, appearing straight and rigid, with bulges in it
like " knuckles." The plaques travelled along the whole
length of the rod, showing its emergence from the solar
plexus, to the far end where an object was in levitation.
Trumpets, high up in the air, are also lit up by the
plaques, which travel all round the trumpet to show no
visible connection.
Plate No. 26 was obtained within two minutes of the
commencement of a developing circle. Mr. Webber had
been bound to the chair and the white light put out,
leaving the ruby lamp alight. The sitters had com
menced to sing when Mr. Webber remarked :
" There
is something over my face ; try a photograph." An
exposure was made, resulting in the picture shown.
While levitation of objects in a white light is not
uncommon, here is obtained (for the first time, it is
believed) a photograph of ectoplasm in a physical state,
taken with the medium
" normal
" in red light. The
word normal is quoted, for while the medium was quite
conscious of what was taking place, he was in an
extremely sensitive condition.
After the exposure had been made, Black Cloud spoke
in the
"
independent
" voice, saying that when the plate
was developed,
" it would show ectoplasm over the head
and face."
The source of the ectoplasmic emergence is from the
body below the neck.
Later on during this sitting, sitters in the circle felt
their heads similarly enmeshed in ectoplasmic material,
which stretched out from the medium. The circle, being
a small one of seven sitters, saw, at one time, the floor
space filled with ectoplasm, rising up round their legs.
The atmosphere was very cold.
Plate No. 32 shows a length of ectoplasmic material
over five yards long—the wide-angle lens of the camera
could not receive the full length.

91 MEDIUMSHIP OF JACK WEBBER
Addendum. March, 1940.
These two photographs of ectoplasmic formations
were secured in January, 1940. They are remarkable for
an unusual instruction from the Guide, eloquent of the
improved technique the Guides were acquiring with
the further development of the medium, illustrating the
manner in which they were co-operating with the
efforts to secure evidential photographs.
The author was in charge of the photographic
apparatus and white light and all was ready to take a
photograph should the opportunity come. The sitting
was proceeding and throat noises were heard coming
from the medium, when the unusual instruction was
received
"
photo and light."
A photograph being anticipated by the character of
the throat-action noise, the infra-red was immediately
flashed by pressing the switch, the right hand came across
and closed the shutter in front of the plate, returning
to the white-lights witch. Both these switches are of
the press kind, so that no delay was caused. Before the
commencement of the sitting both these switches and
the camera had been placed so conveniently that all
could be worked quickly and without the necessity to
rise from the chair. The three movements were there
fore rapid, and the only interval between the photo
graphic exposure and the white light was the time
allowed to close the plate shutter. Two seconds is a
generous time allowance.
Plate No. 30 was the first to be taken, and it will be
realized that the absorption back into the medium of the
ectoplasmic formation was therefore instantaneous.
It is obvious that it would be impossible for the medium
in the photographed roped condition to dispose normally
of the material requiring the use of his hands and to
return to the roped position inside two seconds.
It would also have been impossible for any sitter to
have taken and secreted the volume of material without

unlinking hands, and other sitters becoming aware of
the movement. Also it is doubtful whether any sitter
could have disposed of the material before the white
light was switched on.
A few minutes later, after the plate had been changed
and a new sashalite bulb inserted in the infra-red cabinet,
a similar instruction was received
"
photo and light."
On this occasion Plate No. 31 was secured. The author
was ready for this instruction, and the period between
the infra-red flash and the white light was not more than
one second, indeed the operation was so rapid that for
a few moments the medium came back to normality.
It will be seen in this second photograph the expanse
of ectoplasmic material is considerably greater, and the
absorption back into the medium must have been an
instantaneous action immediately after the exposure.
It is hard to imagine a more perfect test condition
for a medium than this, or more definite evidence of
super-normal activity.
How completely these photographs dispose of the
theory recently put forward that ectoplasm is a cheese
cloth-like material, swallowed by the medium before
the seance, regurgitated, and then reswallowed ! In the
light of these photographs, and the time-factor,
the absurdity of such a thesis is so obvious that no
other comment is necessary.
Plans had been made to re-demonstrate this phe
nomenon before various scientific faculties and photo
graphic societies, and this was only prevented by the
passing of the medium.
It is confidently asserted, that these two photographs
prove beyond doubt the existence of operating spirit
intelligences possessing a knowledge of forces, anatomy,
and laws entirely unknown to man.

CHAPTER XVII
MATERIALIZED FORMS, HEADS, HANDS, ETC.
THE
first phase of Mr. Webber's mediumship to
produce materialized forms was the creation of
heads only, which were illuminated by means
of the luminous plaques. With this development came
hands, that were felt and seen by the sitters.
Looking into the heads full faced, they are seen to be
of perfect formation ; hair, eyes, nose, and mouth being
fully physical.
The faces are often full-sized, but now and again are
much smaller than any normal head, being about four
to five inches high.
A white ectoplasmic cowl invariably surrounds the
head, and the shape of shoulders and garments can be
glimpsed in the illumination.
The period of formation occupies only a few seconds.
When the plaque first illuminates the head it may not
be perfectly formed, but it rapidly assumes the correct
features.
The heads remain in the proximity of the medium,
probably linked to the medium by an ectoplasmic
connection. They can, however, travel about six feet
from the medium in any direction.
After the head has formed and a short period of time
has elapsed, the lips are seen to move, and sounds like
a preliminary struggle for articulation ensues. This
finally leads to the materialization speaking to the
sitters. This speech is usually perfectly audible, and the
difference between that of a woman, a child, a man, or
a Guide is quite distinctive.

MATERIALIZED FORMS, HEADS, HANDS, ETC. 95
The forms of Guides build up strongly, particularly
so with the controls of the medium, in which case the
voice is loud and clear.
These heads have been recognized very many times
by sitters as the faces of those whom they knew when
on earth.
Guides are often able to give further details of their
personality, either showing head-dresses, colouring of
features, or speaking in their own tongues. Conversa
tions have taken place in tongues other than English
between a materialized head and a sitter. If a person
passed over as the result of head injuries, bandages,
and blood-stains are reproduced to add weight to the
identity.
Hands of all sizes are also seen by the plaques, and
if in an instance ofthis nature there had been a deformity
in physical life, such as the loss of a number of fingers
or enlarged joints, these are faithfully reproduced.
Sometimes as many as five or six forms may be seen
at a seance ; at others, there may be materialized only
one head, or not any at all.
The copious white ectoplasmic cowling is evidential
of supernormal power apart from the heads themselves.
So voluminous is it that it would be difficult for any
person to secrete it. Mr. Webber is always open to a
search ; in fact, after there has been shown excessive
cowling or drapery, the Guide invariably asks the chair
man of the seance to search the medium before he leaves
the presence of the sitters.
Frequently, hands are felt by sitters. They are full
physical hands. The large hand of a powerful man or
the small hand of a child. They are, as a rule, slightly
wet, yet their temperature is warmer than the hands of
the sitters themselves. The latter through being linked
for an hour or more are usually hot, yet the materialized
hand is the warmer. If the hands are of Chinese Guides,
the long nails which these Guides have can be felt by
the sitters.

96 MEDIUMSHIP OF JACK WEBBER
Sometimes the hands caress the face, hands, and arms
of a sitter, or they may play with the hair or an ornament.
There is another phase of materialization that is
worthy of comment. In a dark seance a cigarette-
lighter has been flicked on, and in the white flash there
has been outlined the solid form of a being with out
stretched arm—one of the medium's controls.
At times, when the sitters are known to the Guide,
or it is judged they will not be alarmed by a little
frivolity, jokes are played. On one occasion Mr.
Bernard Gray, of the Sunday Pictorial, who was present
at the seance, had his hair lightly tied to that of the
author. If there should be spare rope or string, a sitter
may find himself or herself securely tied. (See
" The
Securing of the Medium.")
Thus the fact has to be taken into account that at
times there may be present in the circle the materialized
forms of the medium's controls who are carrying out
work in connection with the phenomena. The author
has not yet excluded from his mind the work of controls
in this state of being responsible for the joining of two
parts of a trumpet together, removing the spectacles
from a sitter's face, and perhaps assisting with the
final stage of removing the coat from the medium.
At the present time, the developing circle is sitting
in red light for materializations, and the physical forms
have been seen, felt, and conversed with. During such
phenomena the medium is often seen bound to his chair.
With materialization, at first a vague, shadowy
form is seen, darker than the prevailing light. This
form then becomes denser, and the hands and head
are held to the red light for closer examination. The
red light is about nine feet from the floor, yet the
materialized people are able to rise to it and expose
their heads in close proximity to the bulb.
Reuben and Paddy materialize most easily. At one
circle Reuben materialized perfectly. He took hold of
the author's hand and passed it over his face. This

was repeated with other sitters. It was noticed that
Reuben's hands were very warm. A conversation also
took place between Reuben and those present. Thus
not only is a physical figure present, but the lungs and
larynx must also have been formed.
The warmth experienced in materialization raises an
interesting problem. From whence does the warmth
come ? Ectoplasm as felt, is wet and cold, yet it is
from this substance that the forms build themselves.
One reasonable hypothesis is that the ectoplasm is in a
state of very high vibration, and just as the infra-red
ray is the transition stage between light and heat (there
is always heat with the infra-red ray) so it may be that
the condition of " vibration
"
(for want of a more
expressive word), which is used for the purpose of
materializations may give the heat that is certainly in
evidence.
When a form has built up in the red light, its dis
appearance is of interest. Standing full length in the
centre of the circle, it is seen to diminish downwards as
if passing through the floor. The period of time neces
sary for the disappearance is about two seconds. After
the disappearance of a form, throat action is heard from
the medium —gulp-like sounds, rather similar to those
made when ectoplasm is returning to the medium's body.
On the occasion previously referred to, when the
red light was detached from the fitting, it was used to
fight up the faces of materialized people, the lamp
being held close to, and almost touching, the faces,
so that there could be no possible doubt at all as to the
form being present.
Three forms have been seen at the same time, in a
moderate degree of red light —two of the forms were
full length, while the third, quite small, was of Paddy, a
boy of about ten years old.
At most seances a small spirit child, answering to the
name of Matilda, skips with a rope, and obeys requests
for fast skipping, hopping, etc.

98 MEDIUMSHIP OF JACK WEBBER
The following are extracts from published reports, by
independent persons, dealing with this phenomenon :
"
Jack Webber gave four remarkable seances at
Cambridge. . . . He came alone and only arrived a
short time before the first seance ... so there was
no chance of anything being arranged beforehand.
Several well-known people were present, including an
Indian Prince (Prince Deo), and the Dean of Trinity
College. Some members of the Cambridge Society
for Psychical Investigation were present at each
seance.
" The sittings were carried out under test condi
tions. No restrictions were made as to the method of
tying, in fact, he was tied so tightly one evening that
some of the sitters complained that it might stop his
circulation. But Jack just said :
'
That's all right, let
it go.'
" On three nights, materialized heads appeared, and
although some of these heads were perfectly formed
they were considerably smaller than normal size. The
most remarkable materialization occurred when the
head of an Indian came close to me, the features
showing clearly above the luminous slate.
" The head bowed, and when I asked him if he
could tell me his name, he said
'
Ranji,' which, of
course, was the name by which Prince Ranjitsinhji
was known when he was up at Cambridge at the
height of his fame as a cricketer. I knew him quite
well when he was up at the University."
(Mr. A. J. Case, President of the Cambridge Research
Society, reporting in the Psychic News, August nth, 1939.)
" For me, the most outstanding event of the seance
was the materialization of two faces. A luminous
plaque rose from the floor, and came within a few
inches of my face : rising from
it,
partially concealed
in what appeared to be
a
shining band of material,

some two inches wide, was the face of a woman —I
should estimate her to be between forty and fifty
years of age : the face was perhaps a little larger than
three-quarters life-size, and near enough for me to
observe the fine moulding of the features, which were
illuminated with the glow from the plaque. Par
ticularly, I noticed the nose and nostrils, which seemed
to be perfectly chiselled as from alabaster or some
similar material.
" The face was quite solid—three-dimensional,
without colouring, but obviously alive ; I encouraged
it to talk while it floated there, resting on the plaque
which was quite unsupported. The lips moved in an
attempt to answer me, but produced strange
'
ticking
'
sounds that seemed to precede any attempt at speech
on these occasions. Eventually the woman whis
pered :
'
I have no pain now, I do not suffer as I used
to . . . isn't it glorious . . . Mother.' . . . Then the
plaque withdrew and the face disappeared.
" The woman's face was remarkable for the fine
moulding of the features —almost like a piece of
Greek sculpture ; the absence of skin creases probably
accentuated this, and while it was obviously the face
of a mature woman, there was a suggestion of youth-
fulness about it. The eyes were partly in shadow,
owing to the lighting arising from the plaque, so that
it was difficult to determine whether or not they had
been materialized : yet during the whole time the face
remained there—a matter of several minutes—there
was no suggestion of eyeless sockets.
" The second face which appeared after an interval
. . . also came across to within a few inches of my
face, supported by the luminous plaque.
" This time the strong masculine features were
surmounted with a white, typically Egyptian head
dress : the long Roman nose gave the face a look of
severity, and the eyes —what I could see of them,
looked piercingly into mine. This face was unlike its

predecessor in that there was a suggestion of swarthi-
ness about it. Pronounced facial ridges in the flesh
enhanced the severe expression, and the set of the jaw
and mouth suggested a powerful character. Several
times the head bowed in front of me, and, projecting
from the head-dress I noticed a triangular device
which stood out and threw a shadow back on the
forehead. I heard other sitters commenting on the
'
hair
'
; they apparently overlooked this triangular
projection, which had its base in the head-dress, and
apex standing well out from the head. It seemed to
be constructed from different material, and was
evidently not intended to be overlooked. I com
mented on
it,
and, after remaining in front of me for
a
brief period, the head withdrew and disappeared.
" This, too, was solid, and three-dimensional
in
appearance, certainly more life-like than the first,
nearer to life-size, and without the mask-like
appearance that characterized the first, before
it
spoke.
" Needless to say, there were no sitters in the room
resembling either face.
I
later learned that the device
in the head-dress corresponded to that worn by priests
and officials of the ancient Egyptian temples
:
it
apparently signified rank in the temple —this no doubt
explains the repeated endeavours of the head to draw
my attention to the device."
{Special reporter for the Two Worlds, published January
ijth, 1939.)
" In the course of the seance there were five
materialized heads shown against an illuminated
plaque
;
they came to within an inch of our faces.
They were not more than half the size of
a
normal
head. Some of these were Guides who announced
themselves by name, and such names were quite
unknown to Mr. Webber."

" Three faces then materialized and came within a
few inches of my eyes, and they were definitely smaller
than Jack Webber's face."
{Sid. C. Carter, Two Worlds, March $rd, 1939.)
Addendum. March, 1940.
In February, 1940, the Guide asked for the floor to be
covered with white powder. This was done. In the
red light the medium and the white floor was clearly
seen. Materialized forms were seen more easily against
the white background. After the seance it was seen
that the powder had not been disturbed, proving that
the physical materialized forms did not touch the floor,
but
" floated." This peculiar gliding movement of
materialized people has often been commented on with
other materialization mediums, and the above experiment
tends to confirm that they do not contact the floor.
This raises an interesting point, for as the materialized
individuals are definitely physical for the time being,
they do not obey the law of gravity.
Plate No. 35 was obtained in February, 1940, at a
sitting specially arranged for the South London Press,
when two editors and another representative were
present. The photograph shows a perfect materialized
hand emerging (probably) from the solar plexus region.
On this occasion another photograph was secured (and
published by the newspaper) showing the medium's
hands held by the two editors, while the coat was
removed from the body, similar to Plate No. 6. This
newspaper published a laudatory article on the medium-
ship, as indeed has every other newspaper that has
investigated it. It is pertinent to remember that news
paper men are, as a rule, of the hard, sceptical turn
of mind, and invariably extremely critical of physical
phenomena, and attend with the idea of "

INCIDENTS OF THE MEDIUMSHIP
THE
following selected extracts are taken from
the Psychic Press and other publications.
" At Birmingham, twenty-six roses were apported
into the circle through closed doors and windows
and were distributed to the twenty-six sitters. (The
number of people sitting was not determined until
the very last moment.)
"
Psychic News, July 8th, 1939."
" At Birkbeck, there was a novel experiment. A
bowl of water was placed on a locked piano and a
jug of water on a gramophone cabinet. Despite
the fact that both instruments were well beyond the
medium's reach, Webber's Guides managed to place
a record on the gramophone turntable and play
it,
and also to play the piano.
"
Psychic News, July 8th, 1939."
" Several deceased friends addressed sitters
by
name and in every case correctly defined their exact
degree of relationship.
" At the second seance
I
took my mother. Mr.
Webber did not know my mother was present, yet
my father spoke and addressed her with
a
favourite
expression of hers. The tone and inflexion was
undoubtedly my fathers, so much so, that my mother,
who
is
extremely sceptical, instantly recognized it.

for his Mummy and spoke about a bottle. Asked,
'

He said :
'
Don't you remember ?
You put it in my hand when I was in the coffin.' His
mother broke down on hearing his voice. I asked
him :
'
Where were you when that happened ?
'
He said :
'
Standing by Mummy's side.' Now I
knew nothing of this incident, but on questioning
my wife, I found she had put a small bottle of perfume
in his hand the day before the funeral.
"... there is no possible doubt that the voice
which addressed me through a trumpet floating at
some distance from Webber's chair was my dead
father's voice . . . my father's voice was very dis
tinctive and unmistakable. He was a man of three
Universities, a member of the professional class,
and a man of culture. His speech, voice, enunciation,
and intonation were typical. Mr. Webber's voice
is that of a working man and a provincial.

" The Guide said he would dematerialize the
medium, and before our eyes, in good red light, we
saw the head, hands, and wrists vanish, leaving just
the medium's clothes in the chair. It remained so for
approximately a minute. We all then saw the rapid
emergence of the medium.

CHAPTER XIX
THE GUIDES' CARE OF THE MEDIUM
MR.
WEBBER sits about two hundred times a
year, including public sittings and his develop
ing circle. He has never ceased to sit for his
own further development. It is in this developing circle
that the Guides are preparing to demonstrate in red
light, to develop further the physical materializations of
spirit people, and to conduct their own experiments to
improve their technique for these demonstrations.
Every possible precaution is taken to protect the
medium from accident. During this large number of
sittings, accidents do sometimes occur. Occasionally
some person unwittingly interferes with an article still
connected with the medium by an ectoplasmic arm or
rod. In one instance, in the developing circle, whilst
four trumpets were in levitation, a sitter's arm, on
which a trumpet temporarily had come to rest, was
moved. When such events occur there is bleeding
from the medium's mouth and nose, and once when
somebody deliberately shone a light on to the medium
there was external bleeding from the solar plexus. It
may be that the interference has been slight and phe
nomena have continued after bleeding, but as a rule the
sitting terminates.
The medium has also been unconscious for consider
able periods. Black Cloud has explained that he has to
" leave the body to permit the return of the medium's
astral body. If the condition of the physical body was
such that the astral body could not return, the medium
would pass over."

106 MEDIUMSHIP OF JACK WEBBER
During these periods, especially during the uncon
scious state, the controls are administering healing to the
body. On one occasion such as this, when after a seance
a period of unconsciousness ensued, the sitters present
tried various remedies without success. The voice of
Black Cloud was then heard, telling the people to leave
the medium alone.
Latterly, when mishaps have occurred and a state of
unconsciousness has ensued, Black Cloud has re-entered
the body and brought Mr. Webber back to normality.
It is noteworthy that on such occasions Mr. Webber
feels but slight ill-effect from the incident.
At a sitting when the photographers of the Daily
Mirror were in attendance, endeavouring to obtain a
photograph of the medium roped to his chair in levita-
tion, a mishap took place. Instead of the Guide asking
for "
photograph
" he said,
"
Light," and the one in
charge of the white light did not put it on. Again came
the command, in imperative tones :
" Put the light on,"
and it was put on. The medium was seen to be in the
air some distance from the floor. A major calamity was
feared. Then the sitters saw the medium descend in
slow motion, turning a complete somersault as he de
scended, arriving on the floor on his head, the chair
being upside down, and his feet uppermost. The medium
and chair were stood upright by the sitters, and after a
state of unconsciousness of about twenty minutes,
normality returned. No harm or ill-effect was felt by
the medium. Strangest of all is that there was no bruise
on the head, or even a red mark, where his head came
into contact with the floor. (See
"
Trumpet Pheno
mena
" for similar non-injury.)
Mr. Webber tells of an experience he had as a miner.
He was engaged on repair work, by himself, in a mine
some two miles away from the main shaft, when his lamp
failed . In the low tortuous windings ofthe mine passages
it was almost impossible for any person in the dark to
find his way out. Mr. Webber tells how a small blue

light appeared in front of his face and guided him through
the passages to the main shaft, where his workmates
would not believe his story. This event occurred some
time before Mr. Webber had any knowledge of his
psychic powers.
The following point can never be stressed too much
or too often to people who attend seances of this nature.
Never commit any unorthodox action, or interfere with
any phase of the phenomena, or touch any article in
levitation or after levitation. The medium's life may be
imperilled by such action. The photographs show the
nature of the forces used, but if also the strength used
for various feats is considered, the harm that would be
caused to a medium by the uncontrolled return of these
forces to the physical body must be immediately appar
ent. Interference may perhaps kill the medium, or at
least destroy health, sight, and the powers of medium-
ship. No research experiment should ever be contem
plated without the full knowledge and co-operation of
the Guide in control.
Author's Personal Note. —The author was walking
home one evening heavily laden with awkward parcels,
and unthinkingly crossed a main road immediately on
turning a corner, walking across the road obliquely.
When half-way across he received a sudden impetuous
urge to gain the pavement at all costs. No sooner had
he achieved this than a coal motor lorry travelling at
speed came round the corner. Without any doubt, the
writer would have been in serious difficulties had he not
felt impelled to take quick action to get off the roadway.
There have been other occasions when persons associated
with Mr. Webber have been helped out of difficulties.

CHAPTER XX
ELECTRICAL INTERFERENCES
A
NUMBER of unexplained incidents have occurred
during seances in which electrical apparatus has
been interfered with and other happenings have
taken place that may have a bearing upon the employ
ment of electrical forces by the spirit people.
One evening, preparations had been made to take
photographs by the usual infra-red apparatus. Battery,
connections, leads, etc., were overhauled, checked, and
found to be in order. During the seance, when instruc
tions were given to take a photograph, the bulbs would
not fire. When the seance was over, each bulb that
refused to fire was placed in the light cabinet and on
contact being made they flashed at once.
At Leeds Psychic Research Society a similar experience
was noted. After a failure of the first bulb to flash, the
white light was put on, a new battery was installed, and
the firing points checked. The seance proceeded, yet no
bulb would flash. At one time an unexplained light was
seen near the apparatus.
The strength of the red light in the medium's develop
ing circle has often been varied without human contact
with the rheostat.
After an incident at another sitting, when the electric
light had been put on, the fuse controlling the lights
in another part of the house was put out of order.
In the two latter cases, there is evidence of direct
manipulation of a fuse and the intensity of light, which
apparently could be altered as desired.
The contrary happened with the first two cases cited,

and perhaps also happened in connection with the
incident that follows. Obviously the medium's controls
would not take the trouble to prepare a phenomenon to
be photographed, only to render their own efforts
abortive by interference. It is logical that other spirit
intelligences conducting research work of their own
have been responsible for the occurrences. At times the
medium's control has asked us to disconnect apparatus
as other presences were likely to interfere. When it is
considered, admitting the presence of the controls with
the medium, it is only reasonable to assume that other
independent intelligences can also be present and indeed
that they would take advantage of the opportunity in a
physical seance, where apparatus exists, for the purpose
of conducting their own personal
" tests."
A remarkable incident occurred at Wolverhampton
in January, 1940. A stance had been in progress for a
while when a flash of bright light was seen by all sitters
coming from a levitated trumpet, which immediately
crashed to the floor. The Guide at once asked for light,
when the medium was found to be unconscious and
bleeding from the nose and finger-nails.
The organizer of the seance, a Mr. Herbert Wright,
also a medium, was in charge of the light-switch, stand
ing outside the circle of sitters. As the flash came, he
received a terrific blow in the solar plexus region. As
he reeled he heard the Guide ask for light, which he
was just able to switch on before becoming uncon
scious. It is definitely ascertained that Mr. Wright did
not put the light on and was in no way normally respon
sible for the flash that was seen near the medium.
During the ten minutes during which Mr. Wright was
unconscious, no respiration could be noted and clouds
of steam arose from his body. When he recovered con
sciousness his garments were saturated with perspiration,
and a mark, generally termed a
"
psychic burn," en
circled his body. This mark was red in colour and three-
quarters of an inch wide, commencing at the solar

plexus and travelling right round the body and ending
where it began. This band was extremely painful, yet
the main trouble experienced by Mr. Wright was in
other nerve centres of his body.
The author spoke to the Guide about this incident a
few days later, and Black Cloud gave the opinion that
the incident was caused through a joining up of the force
created through the mediumship with the positive wire
in an electric pendant, near the medium's head.
This is the first occasion recorded with Mr. Webber
where the
" power

person, and there is little doubt that had this not been
the case, Mr. Webber would have suffered severely.

CHAPTER XXI
CONCLUSIONS
MANY
questions will arise in the mind of the
reader who has read the foregoing chapters.
To those convinced of the reality of survival,
little more need be added, for they will recognize the
operation of the wonderful powers of the spirit people,
and while marvelling at them, will understand them.
To the reader not so convinced some perplexity is
inevitable. At the risk of redundancy, it may be repeated
that the whole of the incidents related have occurred
recently. That the mediumship of Mr. Webber is still
with us. That demonstrations can be witnessed and
photographs taken.
It should be made plain that while it would not be
possible to accommodate every individual photographer
or enquirer desiring satisfaction for a particular type of
phenomenon, every effort will be made to afford facilities
for investigation to any bona fide association.
The pertinent fact is that every statement made
dealing with the seance work, and every photograph
taken, are capable of being re-demonstrated.1
This statement is stressed to meet the only possible
criticism that, in spite of the independent corroboration,
the phenomena described are the product of imagination,
and that a conspiracy embracing hundreds of people and
impartial organizations has produced
"
staged
"
photo
graphs.

Written before the decease of the medium. It must be empha
sized that there are other mediums through whose agency
similar phenomena may be witnessed.

112 MEDIUMSHIP OF JACK WEBBER
If the reader accepts the evidence that the super
normal activities did take place, the following observa
tions may be helpful in arriving at a fundamental decision.
1 . Each phenomenon is a deliberate act, planned from
its commencement to its completion.
2. To produce phenomena, law-governed forces are
employed.
3. To produce phenomena consciously, or sub
consciously, is beyond human effort, mental or
physical.
4. To employ forces within man's knowledge intel
ligent direction is required.
5 . To employ spirit-forces, intelligent direction is also
required.
6. The execution of an act of phenomena demands the
application and combination of both spirit agencies
and physical forces.
7. To have gained such knowledge the operating in
telligence can only have obtained wisdom through
experience and thought activity. This experience
has not been gained through human effort and
therefore cannot be the product of the sub-con
scious mind.
8. It is reasonable to accept verbal evidence of sur
vival co-existent with the phenomena as part of the
phenomena.
9. It is reasonable to accept that a form of existence
continues after
" death
"
through the re-creation in
physical forms of persons who have passed over,
together with the ability to recognize and be
recognized, and to converse intelligently about
common memories.
These observations lead to this question :
What can be the nature of the directing intelligence able to
control and direct both the spirit and physical forces ? Logic
affirms that it must of necessity be a discarnatt or spirit

intelligence. This is further demonstrated when it is con
sidered that this intelligence must be in touch with other spirit
people in order to provide for them the means to communicate
through human medium ship. Logic also affirms that there must
be a further period of individual activity after the earthly phase
of existence.
This brings us back to the Foreword of this book in
which its purpose was clearly stated : to demonstrate
that survival is a truth —a proven fact. If this book does
so, its purpose has been achieved and the change in our
code of values must follow.

CHAPTER XXII
THE
" RETURN
" OF JACK WEBBER
S stated in the Obituary Notice, Jack Webber
J. JL 9.30 a.m.
On Sunday, March 10th, at the Wandsworth branch
of the Marylebone Spiritualist Association, Mrs. Bertha
Harris was the medium conducting the evening service.
After the meeting she mentioned that during the
service she felt she was surrounded by trumpets moving
about. Then came the name of Jack Webber with the
impression that he wanted to get in touch with Harry
(the author). It so happened that the author was present
at that service, but owing to a late arrival had to be
content with a seat in the annexe, as the church was
packed, and he left without speaking to anyone.
There was also present a lady who knew that the
medium had passed on, and after the service told Mrs.
Harris what had happened, which explained the presence
of the trumpets and the message which Mrs. Harris
could not understand at the time of its reception.
On Tuesday, March 12th, at Hendon Spiritualist
Fellowship, where Mr. Webber had demonstrated on his
first visit to London, and where, by the invitation of the
President of the church, Mrs. Catherine Wilson, the
author first witnessed the mediumship, little compre
hending the events that were to follow, of which this
book is the result, a medium, Miss Eveline Cannon, was
demonstrating clairvoyance when she saw Mr. Webber.

THE RETURN OF JACK WEBBER 1 1 5
Not knowing that Mr. Webber had passed on, and
believing him to be physically alive, she could not under
stand the vision she saw. Miss Cannon relates that Mr.
Webber, observing her dilemma, shook his head and
disappeared. It was only afterwards when discussing
this matter with Mrs. Wilson that she heard for the first
time of the passing.
• • * • •
On the evening of the same day, at a developing circle
held for direct voice at the Great Metropolitan Spiritual
ist Association, a trumpet was levitated through the
mediumship of Mr. Harold Evans, and Jack Webber
spoke. Mr. Webber had demonstrated a number of
times at this society, and amongst those present were a
number of persons who had known Mr. Webber well.
Apart from the message (characteristic of him), the
sitters recognized the tonal qualities of his voice, so that
the value of the communication was evidential.
On Wednesday, another medium, Mr. Harold Sharp,
saw Jack Webber clairvoyantly with a company of other
people, one of whom he recognized as a Mrs. Lander, a
great friend of Mr. Webber's, who had passed over a
few months previously. To Mr. Sharp's vision Mr.
Webber held up to him a baby. Five weeks before Mr.
Webber's passing, he had attended the funeral of a baby
niece. Mr. Sharp was unaware of this incident.
On the next day, Thursday, after the body had been
interred, preparations had been made for a service for
members of the family and the developing circle, in the
house, in the evening. The chairs had been arranged,
and the only light was that from a coal fire. Mr. Webber
senior, an elderly gentleman, not a strong spiritualist,
entered the room with the idea of having a short rest.

Il6 MEDIUMSHIP OF JACK WEBBER
As he opened the door he saw his son Jack standing
in the room, and instinctively stepped forward—not
comprehending —and shook hands with his son. As he
did so, the realization of what he was doing overcame
him, and made him so distraught that he was indisposed
for some hours afterwards. Mr. Webber senior says he
saw his son as if he were
" really there," and felt his hand
as he shook hands.
During the period of the following two weeks (to the
date when this is being written) many other reports have
been received from mediums who testify that Mr. Webber
has made himself known through their mediumship, but
the above will serve as sufficient evidence that Mr.
Webber has returned. It will be noted in all the above
cases that he returned to people who knew him well,
whom he liked, and .in three cases gave evidence before
the medium concerned knew of the passing.
His family and friends have naturally asked why, with
all Jack's protective influences, attendant healers, and
spirit-helpers, he should have been taken away so quickly.
That question cannot be answered now, but it may yet
be answered with evidence, by the new work he may
undertake, in his new sphere of activity —to prove sur
vival—of which the incidents narrated may be a criterion
of that to come.

Il8 MEDIUMSHIP OF JACK WEBBER
During the next four months Mr. Webber paid three
visits to circles arranged by Mr. Edwards. On the last
occasion, in early September, Mr. George Daisley, the
well-known medium, was present previous to a sitting,
and Daisley, Webber, and Edwards were together in the
seance room. Mr. Daisley jokingly expressed a desire
to see how it felt to be roped in a chair, and he was so
secured. He then said his Guide would like to come
and speak, and he submitted himself for control. His
Guide, Tomaso, spoke and told Mr. Webber that there
would be great and new developments for him in that
room, and, turning to Mr. Edwards, said he would
write a book about them.
At that time no word had been said regarding Mr.
Webber coming to London, and the message was
accepted with considerable reserve.
A few weeks later Mr. Webber wrote to Mr. Edwards
and said he wanted to come and live in London and
asked for suitable premises to be found. At first the
efforts were unsuccessful, and then on an inspiration
Mr. Edwards asked his next-door neighbours if they
would think of moving. He was told that they wished
to, and within a month the house was vacated, and Mr.
Webber and his people were installed.
The work has gone on in the same seance room, the
new development of photographic records has been
taken, and the book is written.
Addendum. March, 1940.
The next time Mr. George Daisley came to the author's
house was in January, 1940, for the purpose of giving
advice, by his Guide, to Mrs. Layton, concerning her
personal development. Mr. Daisley asked the author
and Mrs. Edwards to sit with Mrs. Layton.
Tomaso, the Guide, entranced Mr. Daisley, and during
the time he was present turned to the author and referred
to his previous prophecy, which had come true. Tomaso

THE AUTHOR —HENRY JAMES (HARRY) EDWARDS 119
continued saying words to the effect that there would be
a disappointment with the book, but that would dis
appear. He then said, there is a great sorrow to come,
and the parting between you and Mr. Webber will be
brought about as quickly as you came together.
Again the author was sceptical, and did not pay much
heed to the new prophecy, for then its fulfilment seemed
most remote, but again it has happened, the parting, in
physical life, has taken place, with the abruptness
described.
Did the spirit people have pre-knowledge of Mr.
Webber's passing ? Who can say ? Suffice it that each
prophecy (unacceptable at the time) has proven true.
We only realize the lack of our knowledge and compre
hension of spirit activity the deeper we delve into it.
There is obviously a boundary we cannot pass, but out of
the mists of obscurity we are able to place together a few
factual fragments, preparing the way for the greater
knowledge of the future ; certain at least of the sure
foundation, that there is no
" death," but a new phase of
individual existence, greater than any we can now
conceive.
