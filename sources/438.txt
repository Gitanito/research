    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Pearls.
 A Home Circle Classic, Devoted to the Cultivation of the Natural Mental Forces / A Classic Monthly for the Home Circle.
 1898--1900?  Monthly
 New York, New York.  Publisher: Metaphysical Publishing Company.  Editor: E.F.S. (Elizabeth Francis Stevenson).
 1/1 April 1898.  32 pp., $1.00 a year.

 This was the woman's adjunct to the Metaphysical Magazine.  It was promoted as devoted to the more "practical" side of metaphysics, nearer to the home ("'Pearls' is the result of our efforts to meet this growing want, and its editor and publishers intend that it shall not be found wanting. â€˜Pearls' will be a companion in Metaphysics, dealing with subjects near to the home and dear to the hearts of all who love the light of truth and recognize its universal radiance"), but those were obviously code words for its expected audience: women.  E.F.S., the editor, was an associate editor of the parent journal.  Through its Home Circle Open Column, the journal invited correspondence "on any of the practical questions of everyday life, considered from the bearings of metaphysical and philosophical thought, which, we believe, may be demonstrated as both a lever and a balance for all the difficult problems of life," and offered articles on the same topics largely by otherwise unknown writers, mainly women,  like Mary E Cardwell, Barnetta Brown, F. Booker Hawkins, Hannah Rodgers Sprague, et al.

 The journal announced that "in launching our little journal upon the broad sea of public favor we are animated by a confident trust that we shall receive an appreciative welcome from that portion of the great public to whom our efforts will be devoted-- the home. It is our aim to place in the hands of the family a periodical which shall inculcate high living and high thinking, and whose teachings, built upon the rock of Truth, shall develop the purest ideals, thus sowing a seed which shall become a beautiful flower in many a heart whose virgin soil is ready for the planting, and in many a heart, also, grown world-weary under the daily "cross" of this earth life.  To these, we hope to bring a message of Peace and Love, combined with strengthening Thought, and couched in simple form, within the comprehension of young and old."

 The advertisement for the journal in the New Thought, June 1898, says that the journal "covers all the reliable ground in the advancing mental and spiritual lines of occult teaching, in the purest, clearest, and most loving manner for the mother, the youth, and the child.  It thoroughly up to date and will be maintained at the top by experience and capable minds who have the best interests of the home deeply at heart." It was advertised in Neue Metapsychische Rundschau, June-July 1898,  The New Thought, April 1898, and The Ideal Review, 1900.  LOC.
