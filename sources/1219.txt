FURTHER REPORT ON EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-
TRANSFERENCE AT LIVERPOOL.
By MALCOLM GUTHRIE, J.P.
In November, 1883, I read a paper before the Society for Psychical
Research on some experiments in thought-transference carried on by
Mr. James Birchall and myself, many of them in the presence of
various members of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liver-
pool, who took an interest in the investigation. The experiments
were resumed and carried on till Christmas, when I was obliged, by
iII-health, to discontinue all further inteIlectual work.
However, as I had commenced the investigations, and as it appeared
that the cases of the possession of the power were very few, I considered
it my duty to pursue the inquiry in the interests of science; and my
first endeavour was to secure the aid of some good Rcientific authorities.
I first asked my cousin, Dr. Guthrie, Professor of Physics at South
Kensington, to be present. He, however, was only able to attend one
evening and part of another, and expressed no opinion. I therefore
made it a. rule that I would entrust the investigation to no one who
would not promise to attend four evenings at least, as, moreover, I
found the presence of strangers sometimes disconcerting. In the
spring of 1884 I was fortunate enough to secure the assistance of Dr.
Lodge, Professor of Physics, University College, Liverpool, whose
report was presented to our Society and was published in Vol. II. of
the Proceedings. This report vouched for the genuineness and accuracy
of the experiments, and contained an account of some new arrange-

ments. In the autumn I also had the company of Dr. Herdman,
Professor of Biology at the same college. We were sufficiently
successful under his observation, but not as much so as previously.
In the summer we lost the services of one of our percipients,
l\Iiss Edwards, who left to be married and was no longer available.
Miss Relph, however, kindly continued to give her assistance at
meetings during the autumn, which were attended by Dr. Herdman,
lIr. R. C. Johnson, F.R.A.S., Mr. H. E. Rensburg, and others.
At Christmas there was an interregnum, owing to Miss R. suffering
from a quinsey, and we did not resume work until the month of April.
Dr. Herdman was not able to attend, on account of extra. work con-
Qected with the new marine biology studies; but he recommended three
medical men, of whom one only, Dr. Hyla Greves, was able to take up
the inquiry. Dr. Hicks, President of the Microscopical Society of
Liverpool, also joined in the inquiry; and these two gentlemen have
both expressed themselves as perfectly satisfied with the fact of the
mental transference of impressions without contact from one person to
another, as exhibited by our varied experiments. Throughout the
studies of the autumn and winter I have had the valuable assistance of
Mr. R. C. Johnson, and of Mr. James Birchall, the hon. secretary of
the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool. .
I have noticed a falling off in the facility and success of our
experiments since our first great results were obtained. I do not know
to what cause to attribute this declension. Personally, I find I am not
equal to my former self in my power to give off impressions, and if I
exert myself to do so I experience unpleasant effects in the head and
nervous system. I therefore seldom join in the active experiments,
but leave the thinking for the most part to others. Then we have lost
one of our percipients; and as the novelty and vivacity of our seances
has departed there is not the same geniality and freshness as at the
outset. The thing has become monotonous, whereas it was formerly a.
succession of surprises. We have now nothing new to try. J do not
know if there is loss of power on the part of the percipient; it is just
as likely that the agents are in fa.ult.
I have been, I need hardly say, ,'eryanxious to find additional
casea of percipiency, and I have induced quite a number of people
to make trials in this direction, but hitherto without any satis-
factory result. I have, indeed, heard of several apparently genuine
cases, but have never been able to get at them. There has always
been a reticence which has caused me to meet with disappointment,
when I have ~xpressed a desire for a scientific investigation. Some
cases reported to me turned out to be simply varieties of the willing-
game done under contact, and evidently the result of unconscious
muscular indication.~. One Ca8Q I investigated, in which five or six

persons were supposed to possess the power, was evidently explainable
by the limited number of objects experimented with, all known ~
the supposed percipients, and conjured up by them in the mind's eye.
This was merely a co.se of gueBBing.
I have not much in the way of novelty to report beyond my
previous range of experiments. These included the successful transferp
with and without contact,of (a) visual impreBBions, actual and imagin~
extending up to complicated pictures; (6) impreBBions of pains
under contact, and (c) impressions of tastes and smells under
contact; (d) impreBBions of names and numbers, with and with-
out contact; (e) willing without contact. Dr. Lodge tried
the remarkable experiment of two independent visual impressions.
transferred at the same time by two agents to the mind of one per-
cipient, which resulted in a combined impreBBion, in which the two
originals were absolutely united. At the suggestion of Dr. Herdman,
we tried pains without contact. The percipient, blindfolded and isolatedp
SlIt with hel· back towards the company, who simultaneously infiicted
upon themselves a pain in a given spot, and this has been repeatedly
indicated with great exactneBB by the percipient. Another novelty has
been the transference of imagined tunes. This has not been done with-
out contact, and naturally gave rise to the inquiry whether the notion of
tune could hM-e been transferred by muscular indications. 'Ve there-
fore tried to transfer tunes by muscular indications to all the persons
present, but failed; and it seems not unreasonable to suppose that a.
person who is on his guard can prevent himself from conveying the
sharply-defined rhythm of a tune by a series of paUl or sudden pressures
on another person's hand ; and alao that without COn8ci0U8ne88 of the
rhythmic indications on the percipient's part, the tune could not be
identified.
Some recent experiments in the presence of Dr. Greves have been
a little remarkable as illustrating the phenomena of inversioll and
remlmscence. It has been observed that visual impressions are some-
times given right as left, and left as right In many cases lately pains
have been correctly localised, but placed on the right side of the body
instead of the left, and on the left side instead of the right. Then as to
reminiscence-in some taste experiments recently, it happened three
times running that the taste which the percipient described was not the
one which the agent was at that moment tasting, but the one which he
had been tasting in the preceding trial a minute before, none of the
substances having been named during the course of the experiments.
In looking back over the volumes of diagrams I possess, I find that
a good many which I considered failures at the time are evidently due
to reminiscence of the preceding diagram which had not, in the majority
of instances, been shown to the percipient in the interval. lly atten-

tion was first called to a case of this kind by Dr. Guthrie in regard to
one of the drawings executed in his presence.
'Ve have now a record of 713 experiments, and I recently set
myself the task of classifying them into the 4 classes of successful,
partially successful, misdescripUons, and failures. I endeavoured to
work it out in what I thought a reasonable way, but I experienced
much difficulty in assigning to its proper column each experiment we
made. This, however, is a task which each student of the subject will
be able to undertake for himself according to his own judgment. I
do not submit my summary as a basis for calculation of probability. A
few successful experiments of a certain kind carry greater weight with
them, than a large number of another kind; for some experiments are
practically beyond the region ofguesses. I doubt, indeed, if any amount
of calculation of probabilities will help to convince of the trustworthiness
of the experiments. One successful evening when the conditions are
strict is absolutely convincing; and the simple genuine truthfulness
of the percipients is a better guarantee than any amount of subsequent
cross-examination as to the conditions of trial.
The following is a summary of the work done, classified to the best
of my judgment.

Eu"tller Report on Thought-Tm/l8/ereJ/cc. 429
I append the record of a few of our evenings. I may remark that
since November, 1883, owing to a suggestion of Dr. Guthrie's, the
objects in all our visual experiments have been placed on a screen fixed
to the back of the chair upon which the percipient is seated, blind-
folded-the agents taking their places in front of the screen at a distance
generally of three or four feet. In previous experiments of this kind
the percipient, blindfolded, had faced the agents, the object or diagram
experimented with having been placed at a distance behind the per-
cipient, and the agents looking over her shoulder. I do not consider
that the change of position made any difference in the result of the
experiments.
The following examples will give the most important of the results
from the point where my former account broke oft In every case all
the experiments made on that occasion are given.
London, 24th November, 1883. Evening.
p,.esent: Miss Relph, Miss Edwards, Mr. Hughes, and Mr. Guthrie.
Visitors expected, but it was hoped they would not come, the company
feeling dispirited. Miss Relph proposed to try BOme of the experiments
in colours and outlinea. Miss Relph was blindfolded and isolated, all
joining in as operators. '
1.-Around red spot on satin was ex-
hibited on a black background,
behind the subject.
2.-A pink diamond.
3.-A strip of green ribbon of thia

Not seen at all.
Reply - "Colour bluish green."
Afterwards said to be a diamond.
Reply-"It is green .. shape square

Somebody proposed experiments in tastes, and Mr. G. suggested a few
preliminary experiments in the transference of pains. This being received
with zest by the company, Miss Relph became the subject, and Mr. Hughes,
taking her hand, received the following paiIlS:-

Here Mr. G. tried, &8 subject, to receive a pain. He felt a alight
sensation in the middle joint of the right little finger, and thought
of naming the spot, but thought it would only be a gueaa and
refrained. It afterwards appeared that the pain was located there.
He tried another and failed to receive any impreaaion.
Tastes were next tried.

pins, pricked the front of the right wrist of Mias Redmond.
Mias E. sa.id: "Ia it a taste at all 1" Mr. G. : "Why do you ask 1'"
Miss E. : "Because I feel a sort of pricking in the left wrist." Told
it was the right wrist, but she said she felt it in the left. Miaa.

Professor Herdman was expected, and while waiting for him it was
tletermined to try SOIlltl new experiments. Mr. J. proposed the transference
of pains through obstructions, and Miss Relph went into the next room,
separated by a wooden partition. Two experiments were tried, but in
neither instance was anything felt; one guess was made, but it was wrong.
On Miss Relph's retum, Mr. G. proposed thinking of a word, and wrote
" Victoria" on a card. which was silently passed round. This was the
llosition :-

Mr. G. then proposed pictur8l, and it was understood that pictures from
the Autumn Exhibition would be thought of. Mr. G. wrote on a card, and
}l388ed round silently, "Too Late," the Danle of a well-known picture, and

one easily to be remembered. III five minutes Miss Relph said, "Is it
'Too Late' 1" (" Yes.") "Oh, it came to me so quickly-in two or three
seconds nIter I started." (" Did you see it, or did the idea come to you 'I ")
" I saw it." (" Why did you not name it before 1") "I wanted to make
sure, and it would not go away."
Mr. G. then wrote as before, .. The Last Supper, by Leonardo da Vinci."
In about five minutes Miss Relph said: "Is it the last days of somebody 1
Somehow there seems to be a dying man and a lot of people in the room. A
bed with a dying man, and someone holding a paper or something to him, or
else he is holding it. I don't remember the picture." Miss R. was then
told it was not in the Autumn Exllibition, as she seemed to think, but thll.t
she knew the picture. She said: "It can't be the Death of Nelson." Mr.
G. explained that he imagined a long table covered with a pure white
table-cloth, in a room, with people behind it. Miss R. said: "I saw a lot of
heads straight up and down, like as if kneeling on the other side of the bed...
(" What picture do you think it was?") "The Last Supper." Mr. G.
inquired as to the details of the picture, as he had imagined Christ to btl
holding a large goblet in His hand, and Judas leaning over between Him anti
John, dipping something into it. This in explanation of part of Miss R.·s
description.
The picture of "Dante meeting Beatrice and her Two Companions," in
the Autumn Exhibition, was then tried, but nothing was perceived.
The above is recorded by Mr. G. The following is by Mr. J. :-
Mr. G. then left the room, and the name of a picture, "The Flight
into Egypt" (by Goodall), was written by Mr. J. and passed to Miss
Redmond. In about four minutes Miss Relph said: "Is it the Flight int"
Egypt? I see it quite distinctly."
In the same way Miss Redmond and Mr. J. agreed to think of the
portrait of "Miss Mary Anderson" in same exhibition, but after a simiL"\r
interval had elapsed with no result the experiment was discontinued.
Miss Redmond then left the room, and Mr. J. thought of .. Ellen Terry
as Portia," which was named correctly in about two minutes.
Mr. J. then thought of the" Spirit of Music." In two or three minute;t
Miss Relph said: "Gelert comes into my mind." On being infomled that
this was incorrect, she said she could not see anything else.
"The Druidess," a water colour, was then thought of by Mr. J. TIllS
also was not seen.

LOCAL ANlESTHESIA INDUCED IN THE NORMAL STATE
BY MESMERIC PASSES.
The experiments which form the subject of this paper were a repeti-
tion of those described inthe Proceedings,Vol. I., pp. 257·260,and Vol.II.,
pp. 201.205, and were made with the same operator, Mr. G. A. Smith,
and the same subject, Mr. F. Wells. They were made in the presence
and under the superintendence of Professor and Mrs. H. Sidgwick, Mr.
E. Gurney, and Dr. A. T. Myers, on March 20th and 21st, and July 3rd,
1885, in a room at a hotel at Brighton, engaged for the occa-
sion. On March 20th, Mr. Bull, F.R.C.S., and Mr. White Cooper
were also present.
Mr. Wells has been frequently mesmerised by Mr. Smith, and falls
very easily into the sleep-waking state under his influence. But in the
present experiments he is not put into any sleep, but remains in an
apparently completely normal condition. He lays his hands on the
table with the fingers extended and separated. Mr. Smith holds his
hand pointed downwards, and with the four fingers in a line along one
of llr. Wells' fingers, at a distance varying from say, two inches down-
wards. With his hand in this position, he makes passes for some
minutes along the finger j after which, if the experiment is successful,
the finger oyer which the passes are made, and that only, is found to
have lost all sensitiveness and to have become rigid. The effect goes of[
after a time in any case, but recovery seems to be materially hastened
by reverse passes.
The measures taken to test the effect will be given in detail
presently. With regard to the cause, the present experiments did not
take us very far j indeed, they are so little more than a mere repetition
of part of what was done before, that the only excuse for publishing
them is that in the case of a phenomenon so little observed or recog-
nised the mere verification of the fact that it occurs is worth some-
thing, and so also is the wtimonyof fresh. witnesses, which Mr. and
Mrs. Sidgwick were. It was hoped that Mr. Bull and Mr. White
Cooper might have been so too j but the experiments, on the only
day on which they were able to be present, calIDot be regarded as
successful.
Of the possible explanations of the phenomenon we only endeavoured
to eliminate two, namely, an influence on the nerves due (1) to expecta-

454 Local A.mestllesia induced in tlw
tion on Mr. Wells' part, or (2) to mere monotonous stimulation due to
the passes and independent of the person making them. There remain
the severa.1 possibilities of II. mesmeric efBuence, such 8S Esda.ile
believed water to be affected by when he mesmerised it; of some sort of
what we may perhaps call nervous induction; and of suggestion con·
veyed through unconscious telepathy. Mr. Wells is, according to his
own account, quite unconscious of any effect whatever, mental or
physica.l ; so that, for instance, if he closes his hand he is unaware that
the affected finger remains extended, unless he can see it. From pre-
vious experiments (see Proceeding" Vol. II., pp. 203,204) there is some
reason to think that the effect is only produced if Mr. Smith knows
which finger he is making passes over, which suggests that a
<:onscious direction of his thoughts or will is necessary. It
is, however, very difficult to be sure that, in making this
experiment, the absenc~ of definite direction of attention was
the only change, having a bearing on the experiment, which the new
<:onditions introduced. For instance, a want of confidence on the part
of the operator may have been the real cause of failure. That
mental disturbance has an important effect is at any rate suggested by
part of our experience in tho present series of trials. The reader will
see, on turning to the table of experiments (pp. 457-9) that the success
on the first day was very poor. The first experiment succeeded well
enough, but the second was broken off abruptly because we thought
that Mr. Smith had accidentally touched Mr.Wells' finger, which would
have nullified the precautions taken to prevent his knowing which finger
was being operated on. It was very important, of course, to take note
of this fact; but we made a mistake in breaking off the experimen~
since this was very likely to produce a disturbing eft'ect on the minds
of both operator and subject. And it seems not improbable that the
failure of the subsequent experiments on that day may have been due
to this cause. Further experiments to throw lighfi on the cause of the
phenomenon are much to be desired, but experimenation with Mr. Wells
is attended with much difficulty. He is a busy and prosperous young
man, not himself interested in the investigation; and, notwithstanding
some remuneration given for loss of time, finds it difficult to make
the arrangements necessary to enable bim to leave his business-that
of a baker and confectioner-during the time necessary for the
experiment. The consequence is that we ha.ve found it difficult to
obtain his services at all, have found it still more difficlllt to make
arrangements beforehand, and when Mr. Wells has come have had to
work under an inconvenient sense of limited time. We are, however.
grateful to him for the opportunities be has given us of trying experi-
ments which must be, to him, very tedious and uninteresting.
We proceed to the precautions taken to exclude, as fa.r"as possible,
Digitized by Google
Normal State by lllesmel'ic Passel. 451)
the operation of expectation. Mr. Wells was, of course, aware of the
nature of the experiment, and that one of his fingers was to be made
insensitive; but he was effectually prevented from seeing which of
the ten it was by two large sheets of thick brown paper, through
holes in which his hands were passed. This screen extended in aU
directions ,far enough to prevelit the possibility of his seeing round it,
and the armholes fitted closely enough to prevent his seeing through
them. We were unable ourselves to fee~ by air currents or otherwise,
passes made over our fingers; and unless Mr. Wells' perceptions are
more acute, the paper screen seems to reduce the chance of his forming
a correct opinion as to which finger was being operated on to 1 in 10.
As a further precaution, Mr. Smith's passes were, in most of the experi-
ments, imitated over some other finger by one of the other persons pre-
sent; so that if the passes could be felt, they might be felt in two fingers.
This would not guard against the possible perception of some subtle
difference between Mr. Smith's passes and others which eluded our own
observation, but it is difficult to see how this can be guarded against.
The finger to be operated on was always selected by some person other
than Mr. Smith; but the proximity of the operator and the "subject"
is such as would make it hard absolutely to preclude the former from
informing the latter, by auditory or other signs, which is the selectec:l
finger, did he wish to do so. We have, howevElr, every reason to
believe Mr. Smith to be as much interested in carrying out a genuine
experiment as the other persons present.
The passes made simultaneously over a different finger by another
person served further to exclude the second explanation we have spoken
of, namely, that the aruesthesia may be due to the effect of mere pas&ell
on the nerves. Here again, however, as it seems almost impossible to
prove that there is not some mechanica.l difference between the passes
of Mr. Smith and his "imitators, which cannot be discerned by tl\.e eye,
the explanation is not completely excluded; and it is just conceivable
that some unconscious mechanical change in Mr. Gurney's mode of
making the passes may explain the fact that in one experiment
(No.9) the finger that he operated on imitatively, as well as that
operated on by Mr. Smith, became insensitive. This happened again,
but to a very slight extent, in experiment No. 12. The fact seems
iDlportant, though the exact import of it canI10t be ascertained
without further investigation. It, at any rate, seems to aft'ord an
argument against the hypothesis that the effect is due to mesmeric
efBuence.
This Dlay be the most convenient place to mention two other
anomalies observed, and which we cannot at present interpret. In
experiment No. 6 Mr. Smith operated on the middle finger of
Mr. Wells' right hand, but it was the index finger, and not the
Digitized by Google
456 Local AmeJJilwsia induced ill t~e
middle finger, which became insensitive and to some extent rigid. And
in the next experiment (No.7) when the fourth finger was operated on
with success, the middle finger, which should have been rendered
insensitive in the previous experiment, seemed to be to a slight extent
affected, though this wo.s a little doubtful. We have no note of reverse
passes having been made over this finger after the previous experiment,
nor ofany imitative passes being made in experiment No.7. Something
of the same kind occurred in experiment No. 19. In the previous
experiment the fourth finger of the left hand had been operated on, but
only for two minutes and with slight success. Reverse passes were
then mada and sensitiveness, as we believed, completely restored. In
experiment No. 19 the little finger of the right hand was operated on
successfully, but the finger of the previous experiment became even
more insensitive, and it was not the one over which imitative passes
were made.
To test the insensitiveness, electric shocks were given hy means of a.
medical magneto-electric machine. One terminal ending in a cylindrical
brass handle, was placed under the palm of Mr. Wells' hands, and con-
tact was made with the finger to be tested by meansof the point of a wire
forming the other terminal; or, in experiments10 to 16, with the edge of
a cylindrical brass handle. The machine was adjusted to give the
strongest current it was capable of, and the handle turned as fast as we
could, that is about 2j- times a second. Each tum of the handle
represented about 8! turns of the coils. In experiments 10, and 17 to 2()
inclusive, care was taken that the palm of the hand, which rested on the
electrode, should be moist; and in the last four experiments the point of
the wire with which the other contact was made was previously
dipped in water. In experiment 16'the palms of the hands were
wetted with a sponge after the passes had been made, but before the
insensitiveness was tested. It was then found that a prick could be
felt in the finger operated on, but apparently not the electrical shock;
but curiously enough this was the only experiment in which the electti-
cal shock contracted the fingers. The partial insensitiveness quickly
disappeared without reverse passes, and renewed passes did not restore
it for some time, and then not completely. AB we supposed that this
might be due to fatigue, the experiments were discontinued for that day.
Rigidity was not looked for; but no reverse passes were made, and Mr.
Wells, on trying to close his hand after the screen was removed, found
the finger to be rigid.
In some of the experiments the insensitiveness was tested by a.
severe prick (applied in experiments 1 and 15 under the nail) as well
as by the electric shocks.
During the first experiment Mr. Bull noticed that Mr. Wells
trembled a good deal, suggesting an exercise of self-control But it is
Digitized by Google
Normal Slate by Mesmeric Pa88e8. 467
Dot unlikely that the trembling was simply callsed by the ra.ther violent
tremor in the table on which his hands rested, caused by turning the
electrical machine. In experiment No. 5 Mr. Bull observed the same
trembling, but did not think it coincided with the severest shocks; and
his final opinion was that the trembling had had no emotional signific-
ance. Care was taken throughout the experiments to tum the machine
when no contact was made, 80 that the exact moment of the shocks
should not be known by the shaking or the sound. During t.he last six
experiments of March 21st, Mr.Wells was reading to himself behind the
screen, and as far as we could judge went on doing so calmly when the
Ehocks were applied. During two of these experiments Dr. Myers
(,specially noticed that the motion of his eyes travelling across the page
was quite equable, which seems a good proof of unconsciousness of pain.
On July 3rd Mr. Wells was engaged the whole time in conversation
with Dr. Myers, and during the last experiment especially he was
talking steadily and confidentially. Dr. Myers had good opportunity
of observing the pupils of hia eyes, and could see no change due to
pain. The proof of insensitiveness is therefore, we think, pretty
complete.
The following is a synopsis of the experiments. The fingers are
numbered in order beginning with the thumb of each hand, and the
hands are distinguished as R. and L., 80 that, for example, L 2 means
the index finger of the left hand. All the experiments are included.

REPORT ON AN ALLEGED PHYSICAL PHENOMENON.
Commiele6 :-WILLIAM CROOItES, F.R.S. ; VIcroR HORSLEY, F.R.C.S.;
W. C. BuLL, F.R.C.S. ; and A. T. MYERS, M.D.
On April 17th, 1885, Mr. Husk met us at 24, CIarges Street, and
courteously agreed to such slight inconveniences as our examination of
necessity involved.
We found a metal ring on his left forearm; and our inquiry was
/.

limited solely to the determination whether that ring could have come
into the position it then held by known natural forces.
The ring was of iron, solid, formed of a continuous bar, skilfully

welded in one place, bearing marks of a file throughout, especially near
the place of welding. The internal circumference (as determined by
the mean of two independent measurements, differing from one a.nother
by Imm. only) was 182·5mm. ; the thickness of the iron, 4·5mm. In
shape it was roughly elliptical, the length of the major and minor axes
being 68mm. and 48mm. The hand was fairly normal in size and
proportion, and contained no soft tissues in excess; all the joints were
loosely articulated; the fingers turned slightly outwards. No scars
were observed. A short transverse line was drawn on the back of the
hand at the level of the lowest point of the styloid process of the radius,
and at right angles to it another line down the long axis of the third
metacarpal bone, to the centre of the knuckle of the middle finger (third
meta.carpo-phalangeal joint). The length of this was found to be
I) centimetres, as shown in the diagram. It was divided into eight
parts, and used to determine some other measurements.
The hand was held out loosely, with the fingers in nearly complete
extension, and the thumb turned inwards and lying across the palmar
surfaces of the hand. In this position, under slight compression, the
greatest circumference of the hand was found to be 230mm. Before
other measurements were taken, the hand was reduced to a more
compact shape by gentle manipulation; it was "troughed," i.e., the
inner and outer palmar surfaces were approximated, the back was
thereby made more convex, and the thumb was drawn downwards and
inwards, so as to lie almost completely in the trough so formed in the
palm of the hand. Measurements of the circumference were then
taken, first with metallic tape, afterwards with copper wire, at points
marked in the diagram: moderate, but not painful pressure was used
at the moments of measurement. The measurements showed :-

The measurement at 5, with the metallic tape, was repeated after
flexure of the wrist, but showed no appreciable difference.
The greatest circumference of the hand, measured as described
before it was "troughed," exceeded the internal circumference of the

ring by 47·5mm., or about Hin.; after it had been "troughed," by
11·5mm., or under lin.
Where the ring fitted most loosely, ie.,
about an inch above the wrist joint, it was
found easy to insert between it and the forearm
a solid body of about 23mm. square, as is
roughly shown in section.
It was considered that any attempt to take measurements of the-
smallest circumference to which Mr. Husk's hand could be reduced,
would necessitate considerable pressure for the emptying of the blood-
vessels as far as possible, and the decisive elimination of all voluntary
or involuntary muscular contraction,* and might possibly be so painful
as to be unjustifiable without the administration of an amesthetic. As
Mr. Husk was disinclined for this, no such a.ttempt was made.
Mr. Victor Horsley subsequently took measurements, with metallic
tape, of the circumference of the right hands of three men-Mr.
Crookes assisting in two of the cases-(l) under the same conditions
as those applied to Mr. Husk; and (2) again when they were under
the full influence· of ether, but no other additional means had been
taken to reduce the volume of the ha.nd, e.g., by pressure, «c., &c. The
points of measurement were distant 1, 2, 3, «c., centimetres from th~
styloid process of the radius, along the metacarpal bone of the index
fingel', after the plan adopted with Mr. Husk. The results were as

These show a. decrease in the three la.rgest measurements of an
lwerage of IOmm.
The conclusion to which we are brought is, that under the con-
ditions of measurement in Mr. Husk's ca.ae, the greatest circumference
of the hand exceeded that of the internal circumference of the ring by
II·amm., or rather less than half·au-inch; and that, u.s we do not
consider these conditions to be those best adapted to reduce the
circumference of the hand as much as is possible, we cannot infer that
it is impossible that the ring should have come into the position in
which we found it by known natural forces.
