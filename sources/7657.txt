  		              		Experience Description   

    I had a cardiac arrest and was was dead for 25 minutes. I  remember going to a wooden house. There was a  strong sun setting in the evening. I went into the house and there was  no furniture inside. There were no windows inside, just the outside frames of the windows. I floated upstairs and  was going out the top window. Before I could leave, they asked me if I wanted to stay or go. I said that I would stay for my children. I was told that if I came back that  my life would be very hard for years before it settled down. I didn't care because I  wanted to go back for my sons.
