you
the next time he was in 1957 after he
took command of to 552 missile battalion
he had several incidences in the desert
one of them is a cave that they G I
showed him that was there and it was
always animals had water in the cave and
it was a cool place to go out of the
desert and often many of the men would
go up there and himself on you know just
for excursion and something to do you
got to understand red Canyon is very
isolated for many there&#39;s no stores or
anything around they built a church
there which I think was highly
interesting later on there&#39;s a story
that involves that but anyway he went to
this cave and when he was in the cave he
tells the story of the first meeting
with the alien in the cave do you want
me to go into detail on that he said he
was kind of laying back sleeping
relaxing dozing off and all sudden he
rolled over and pulled his gun they
always wore their gun whenever they were
off their post up there and he pulled a
gun and he pointed it toward this forum
he says he didn&#39;t recognize what the
forum was so he asked
he says friend or foe the forum said
neither but he was very very upset
because the message came mentally and he
figures how in the heck is this thing
and what is it and what is it doing
he later sees it move a little bit and
he sees that it has a type of helmet on
with a type of stone in the center of
its head on a band he drew pictures of
it or had an artist draw it this
creature asked him to shut down his
radars for 15 minutes he says that he
figured in his head how does this thing
know time the only person that could
give that command to shut these radars
down
he asked a creature well why should I do
it or what&#39;s in it for me the creature
answered a new world if you can take it
at the time it that had little to no
meaning to him only in later days did it
have a meaning meaning to it he went out
at a cave called sergeant Rex ACK
told him to shut down the radars and he
says that as he was leaving the cave he
sees the creature standing in the end of
the cave and he does kind of a gesture
with his hand which wasn&#39;t a salute or
wasn&#39;t a wave or anything but he saluted
it back and that was basically the end
of the encounter there later no he never
said he never said but later he&#39;s on his
radar as they picked up this is the same
year 57 and I don&#39;t know exact date but
he left 12 hours of film that gives
exacting details they picked up a ship
moving over 3,000 miles an hour through
the atmosphere it went down near red
canyon so he had a light airplane then
and he got the pilot he flew up looked
around and he saw a shiny object on the
ground he figured that he would
investigate closer by himself so he
landed did not take anybody with him got
one of the old staff cars went out into
the desert and he says he found a craft
and it was he says it was perfectly
smooth it was oval shaped more like a
cigar and a saucer stuck into a side are
less ting against a rock sideways he
said this thing would fade out
completely and then fade back in he
thought he was loosen a ting and he
couldn&#39;t figure this out what was going
on he was scared to death he says but he
managed to take a tumble weave and throw
under it when it was faded when it was
gone
just to see if he was elucidating or if
it was real it came back again he says
that he touched it
it was cool to the touch on the side he
says when it disappeared again I went
back out of phase again the tumbleweed
was crushed so he knew it was physical
he said there were footprints around the
craft I always felt like there was more
there that he hadn&#39;t told just my
personal feeling because you don&#39;t see
footprints in the craft I don&#39;t think
without having a second encounter but
that&#39;s my own personal view
he says the ship began to vibrate he
says he got scared he jumped back into
staff car threw it in reverse it went
flying backwards and he says the motor
stalled he said he saw the thing rise up
turn and go up into the air and then it
went into an envelope that it kind of
imploded into and he says later on he
told von Braun about it he told Albert
about it which were on his scientific
teams later on he knew them because he
was in charge of Operation Paperclip for
President Eisenhower so you know this is
a man of credentials telling a story
like this my wife and I always said this
story is bull you know do the are we to
believe him and this I must say this
about my father when you see his
presence on film and if you knew my
father for only a few minutes he never
would change his story he would never
make the fish longer even he told the
story he would tell in front of anybody
he didn&#39;t care who they were
credibility credentials or whatever he
would tell it the same as he would tell
any other story about mi A&#39;s or so like
that or you know such they would do
research for the White House they were
part of Operation Paperclip they they
would do research on for instance if you
want to know one of them but my dad was
a declassifying office on his project
horizon see President Kennedy really
didn&#39;t do such a great thing when he
said we&#39;re going to send a moon landing
by whenever it was 1967 or
whenever he promised us already ended
1969 that I had actually all been
proposed and project horizon obviously I
would say that the president probably
knew about this because it was
classified at the time later on when it
was put into the book my dad was the
declassifying officer on that so he knew
it was it was to put on I remember
seeing that as a boy by accident I
picked it up on his desk one day and it
was a about an inch thick and it had all
color photos in it and I said wow look
at this space stuff you know and of
course I didn&#39;t know what it was if it
was a fiction book or what it was but I
do remember seeing it he speaks of a man
named will Byrd Smith which was a great
investigator of UFOs and phenomena built
a lot of machinery for magnetism and you
know along a Tesla lines that was
Canadian he was disgraced that says
later on that exchanged medals with him
in the 60s of course dad has discussed
this issue with many politicians he
discussed this issue with coarse Strom
Thurmond he discussed this issue with
the CIA director J Edgar Hoover he&#39;s FBI
I&#39;m sorry yeah he discussed this also
with CIA leaders I don&#39;t know who they
were but he says really all branches of
the services and the you know
intelligence community he briefed
several of the Chiefs of Staff they did
keep the information from several
presidents they figured that they just
did not have the matrix to to be briefed
on this subject one was Carter he
wouldn&#39;t he would never know they said
and there was actually a group of about
thirty now don&#39;t pin this number to an
exact number but he says about thirty
key generals and key military and key
congressional people such as he Bree
John McCormack Speaker of the House I
was actually under his patronage for a
while I worked on Capitol Hill as a
Capitol police
and as a page and he briefed these
people he briefs senator Strom Thurmond
another congressman that dad was very
close to was John Fein from Ohio he
briefed him why this why did they brief
these certain people it was part of my
dad&#39;s agenda and others at the time to
keep knowledge and secret and to let
knowledge out in certain areas and this
was more or less a community of friends
there were many generals involved in
this and a pack was the lasted I could
tell and the last that did die you&#39;re
blinking red alas that did die was of
course general Trudeau and then my
father told everything after General
Trudeau but if you notice there was
never a word said before 1992 my father
was on the National Security Council as
a he was intact now this is a part here
that becomes Freeman raised a question
and it became very controversial when it
should not have been my father was not
on the council but he was an adviser to
the council for the president in other
words as many advisors that sit in on
council meetings and they just sit back
and take notes and then report back to
the President as far as being listed as
part of the council no he was not and
why a big deal with us not going there
it just wasn&#39;t necessary but to answer
your question I&#39;m going to tell this in
my words these weren&#39;t exactly my dad&#39;s
words I try to keep his words pure but
it went something like this
Eisenhower he says asked him where these
creatures were from I&#39;m speaking of
Roswell that says we don&#39;t know he says
what do they want
he said we don&#39;t know that either so Ike
he said said well of course oh what&#39;s
your opinion what should we say about it
and dad says the answer to Ike was look
world military man
let&#39;s just say nothing but it did
penetrate our airspace
so we have to treat them as foe and in
so the cover-up or whatever you want to
call it began my father says there was
never a cover-up never intended to be a
cover-up
well with all these agencies and with
the White House not wanting to say
anything
it certainly shortly got written into
mandate to be a cover-up and that&#39;s how
my father says for instance the
government doesn&#39;t need to cover itself
up it&#39;s so inefficient to do it itself
but as you can see this is developing a
pattern it wasn&#39;t just chanced and my
father was put in research and
development in 1960 under foreign
technology because this is now the the
second time in the government are a
second time that since he was in the
career you might say from Fort Raleigh
to Eisenhower to general Trudeau this
was no accident because you can see that
Eisenhower was also another very
important president that had
disinformation and knew of this
information
my dad says my dad says he knew he knew
of the information what type of
technologies and how would a transferred
I go back to where Dad first inherited
the file the file general Trudeau had
brought up as soon as he took his job
had it brought up from the basements of
the Pentagon this file had a lock on it
just like in our website we tried to
duplicate it that&#39;s a four drawer and it
was a three drawer he speaks up on the
film&#39;s it had materials in it it had
classified files and it had files on the
Philadelphia Experiment it had files on
many other government issues besides
Roswell but it did have some artifacts
in it these artifacts my father said
there was actually a file that briefed
worthy artifacts came from and it was
indeed Roswell 1947 July 4th and these
artifacts were he speaks of laying three
of them on a triangle on his desk and
general Trudeau walking in and saying
what&#39;s that junk on your desk
we and dad would say well you know these
could change the world needs general
truths and yes I know and we just hope
that people that come afterwards will
know what to do with these
well first was a piece of metal and this
metal was kind of different because it
couldn&#39;t be penetrated folded and
creased or sealed but when they sent it
to one of the laboratories
I remember dad saying they put a certain
frequency and current to it and it
became transparent and it passed energy
through it and it could be cut and
destroyed in another object that he had
was the first integrated circuit more
than an integrated circuit though it was
a wafer a very multi stacked wafer with
a kind of a prom window in the middle of
it partially burned on one end now this
is the interesting part
my father says by him concentrating on
that he can make it glow it would glow a
blue light he also had fiber optics
laying there they didn&#39;t know what these
things were they figured they were wires
of some sort but didn&#39;t know how they
operate the interesting thing that shows
you that we have not achieved a point of
where these fiber optics are as my dad
would also hold them in his hand when he
close his hand around them the ends
would be glowing so this means they
contained our own energy so you know we
we haven&#39;t reached this state yet of
understanding how materials can
atomically align and and become you know
opaque and and such from that one of the
things that general Trudeau did say to
my father though was after they analyzed
the metal was that an alignment of atoms
any time my dad had any hint of it he
would take the team of ol dirt and and
all of the Germans and scientific team
and go to this facility instantly
because general Trudeau said that would
be bigger than Los Alamos there were
other items he spoke of an item that was
moved over to human body that went to
either John Hopkins or Walter Reid he
never saw it again he said it also
couldn&#39;t be opened such he had the first
laser in his hand they didn&#39;t know what
it was and he tells the story on film
that he thought I was a flashlight and
the batteries were dead so he had no
idea
this thing was but when they put it to
Fort Belvoir and they put the energies
and currents to it and this and that the
first laser appeared but he says that
the characteristic of this laser is
nothing like we have today it was
molecule size he was sorry he wrote the
book he was sorry he exposed a family to
the ridicule to the lawsuits it&#39;s been
very tough on our entire family he did
not want to die leaving us with these
problems we were very fortunate to find
an angel a true angel and mr. Kent if it
wasn&#39;t for this man I certainly would
not be sitting in this front of this
camera now just hope that the future
people such as yourself and me will know
what to do with this type of knowledge
that this man brought forward I do say
that he is the first man to come forward
in a high capacity and possibly it will
start to snowball going down to Hill
getting larger and larger I certainly
hope so because I&#39;m sure then he would
be looking down and be proud of us of
course the the paramount company would
be Bell Laboratories as most of you know
about the lawsuit between American
computer and Bell Laboratories and no
previous history of inventing the
integrated circuit now let me set
something straight for the record I&#39;m
doing like my father didn&#39;t let me a
product okay
he the transistor is an earth invention
okay and people said yes it did come in
1948 began this research on it and
nothing that has nothing to do with the
integrated circuit except for that it is
solid-state and it did begin to
technology and as they would plant some
of this technology such as night vision
they would plant this technology into
areas that were already existing already
working on these areas for instance
there was in for there was an infrared
night viewing device or such that came
from German technology at Fort Belvoir
well that would be the natural place to
take the lens from one of the aliens
eyes and dad says when they held it up
in the hallway they could see
it&#39;s in the background of soldier or
people moving and such it again
contained its own energy nothing like we
have today so they planted these Rd
projects and already existing now they
didn&#39;t implant the artifact that&#39;s a big
misconception too they they gave them up
a procurement they gave them the funding
they gave them the what to develop
toward and then they would insert from
their own laboratories certain knowledge
--is to keep them going on the right
path to keep them developing and if it
took the artifact to get the final
product they did this and it wasn&#39;t
being done benevolently it wasn&#39;t been
done it was being done for the army&#39;s
own advantage over all the other
services and over our enemies and such
like that there was no you know reason
that the public deserved it are two
human beings or kindness or such like
that it was strictly a military
operation he says that the Air Force had
this material from Roswell the ships
actually at Edwards Air Force Base and
that what they had was simply materials
that were thrown into a jeep the reason
he knows that it was in the briefing
file in the file cabinet with the
artifacts so when the army had was there
that&#39;s right imaging crap that&#39;s right
it was a few scraps so the airport had
the entire shipped remainder of the ship
and we were the Edwards Air Force Base
now dad didn&#39;t tell that except for on
his deathbed
I guess it&#39;s clear it was still
classified he was very he had nine
levels above top secret he was still
almost to his dying day you could see
him wavering between sometimes he would
say something and I would come back to
him and he&#39;d say no I never said that
for instance he found a key they
couldn&#39;t get to ship opened up so this
is how I knew he was still in contact in
later days because they could not still
analyze the ship they had no way to open
this
and he told me when he after he had his
first heart attack that there was a key
that they inserted and it began line
seams came out everywhere let me go to
this part to answer that question of
what the extra-terrestrial look like you
know the alien autopsy film he was often
asked if that was real and he says well
he can&#39;t testify whether it&#39;s real or
not but he says let me tell you this
whom an intelligence officer standpoint
there&#39;s three items that date that
whoever faked this film if they did fake
it could not know number one there was
no emphatic system number two it had two
brains four lobes one of the brains was
laced with I sees of course that was not
in the film but it did have to film -
Seth integrated circuit the other part
is is that it had three eyelids
it had the outside one that was
removable had a membrane and then the
eyeball so dad says whoever faked this
if they did fake it had the same report
that he had from Walter Reed by the way
the autopsies were done at Walter Reed
he said that de Bie was indeed parted a
craft integrated into the craft and it
was the propulsion system lack of a
better word there&#39;s really there&#39;s
really not a science to describe how the
craft moved but he said it they knew it
was integrated into the ship and so were
the other occupants of the ship part of
the guidance system so on and so on
the ship was was a living in it entity
also you know we knew that from the
reports they knew it died it simply
turned from blue to brown and died like
a fish out of water
and so did the occupants shortly after
now I tell you something about also de B
there was he often spoke of a room in a
pentagon which you had it like a jail
door you slid it back and you went in
there and you were not able to take any
pencil paper recording device or so and
you simply viewed documents and then you
came out with whatever you could
door in your head once or twice it led
me to believe that there was something
else that was kept in those room or
rooms that would give information he had
a thread also that was from the clothing
and he says that they the ship&#39;s skin
the aliens
suit silver suit and his skin were all
similar material absolutely he was aware
of other crashes he says that the
Germans told him that they had a crash
and that&#39;s where most of their
technology and their advanced materials
and their research as we brought him
here and this was you know part of a
team that he worked with every day he
said there was another crash in 1957 in
Corona they knew that it was Stalin&#39;s
number one mandate to steal Roswell
technology so they they began a
operation to hide it they felt that the
CIA was infiltrated they felt that their
funding would be cut off and they felt
that there would be nothing done with
this material if they did indeed leave a
paper trail or such like that our family
was shocked I mean we absolutely you
know were in disbelief that he would
keep that he could keep this a secret
all these years and my mother would not
be too type to even listen to anything
like that I&#39;m sure that he didn&#39;t I&#39;m
sure he never told another soul except
for people that were in the loop he says
that this group of thirty that were in
charge of his technology he says it
wasn&#39;t a written mandate for them they
were simply hardened battlefield
officers and they had an oath among
themselves
so I guess men that you die next to and
that you fight next to that oath is
probably just as good as if you signed
it with the Lord
so I know my father had never talked to
anyone about this stuff I&#39;m positive he
told me many many times there were no
borders and have not been any borders he
say him and others that were in charge
and political they knew by 1983 we would
become a user country and that means we
would concern consume about 90% of the
world&#39;s goods and we were a Faton Cowen
would keep consuming it this is the way
the economic system is set up he
schooled me that he was taught by two
popes the meaning of money that was a
deal he had worked out with them for
doing certain favors for them father of
flannel tea and and two at a Pope&#39;s
papayas I think 212 and John 2/5 or so
but don&#39;t quote those I&#39;d have to look
into his records to see that no he I was
always a product of his schooling
without me knowing about it
and now I see why maybe I have a job to
do he knew of this yes he knew of he
knew of mi a&#39;s korea he knew quite a bit
about vietnam because of course him and
Trudeau were going to go there they were
one of the candidates to take over the
job yes the world is entirely different
than most people think it is that came
in later days when he told me that after
the book he says the Vatican is indeed
very knowledgeable source my dad knows
of the MIAA s that were left in Korea
and why and how they were moved to
Russia and he testified on open and
closed Senate committees on this he says
that the main reason that this was done
is course because of our liberal views
are sympathizing with communist doctrine
during the time blackmail and it&#39;s in
it&#39;s in my father&#39;s writings in detail
and we didn&#39;t know they did nothing
right now there&#39;s no civilian machinery
to handle another crash if it happens
again it will simply go to the military
and it would probably be the same
situation that happened in Roswell even
though the time is different
thank to military agenda as any
it will come under national security and
it will probably be the end of it I
think that we need a movement that we as
people of the earth and people of the
universe that if a ship does crash here
again which my father said will happen
that we can be in charge of that or how
salvage rights my father after the book
he never knew John Glenn but for some
reason I guess he thought he was very
important so he made a trip to
Washington but there was another reason
he made the trip to see Jean Dixon
she was very sick and he went in the sea
John Glenn and he gave John Glenn a
document on an automobile lightweight
automobile now whether it was a
lightweight impractical or whatever I
don&#39;t know the entire but John Glenn he
gave him two brief on it it was about a
quarter-inch thick and it was from one
of the laboratories that was funded this
is one of the items that came out of the
recession that no one knows about until
right now
I&#39;m except for the people that actually
built and were in on the secret project
but someone might ask John Glenn if he
remembers my dad&#39;s visitation I think it
was in 98 they they would absolutely put
the end to anyone that does that that is
something that has passed through many
generations of our government not to be
done in fact even even teller was good
friends and my father and they knew that
also how they knew it I don&#39;t know but
that he did make that prediction and
darned if it didn&#39;t happen during the
Reagan administration I think when SDI
was started that it was a this is he
told me later you know after 92 when he
wrote a book he says that that was a
planet sense system and that years of
most of the leaders knew that at the
time see the Cold War about as a cold
war and he says the meaning was is that
it was a it was an extraterrestrial war
he says they were terrorizing military
facility rising citizens and interfering
with military facilities and I I would
say and he thought a military solution
well the the planetary defense system is
SDI that&#39;s also a hint I had that
something was up I didn&#39;t understand it
at the time what a planetary defense
system meant but I had a good idea
reading between the lines so what and
you said how many hermetically sealed in
caskets do you have three and a half
four foot and stuntman&#39;s we don&#39;t have
any
hello I&#39;m going to take you to get over
I said well I call em relative by 3:30
this afternoon
so what&#39;s going on well it was important
also but anyway and I own it
