The Fifty-fourth Anniversary
ofthe T. S.
Adyar, Dec. 24th, 1929
Dr. Besant's Presidential Address
Brethren:
Again I have the happiness of
welcoming you here to the F ifty -
fourth Anniversary of the T h e-
osophical Society, and as ever, I
ask you, those of you w ho be­
lieve in the Masters, to join me in
the annual invocation to T hose
whom we believe to be our
Guides, leading us from the u n ­
real to the Real, from darkness to
Light, from death to Im m or­
tality:
"May Those w ho are the em ­
bodiment of Love Im m ortal,
bless with Their protection the
Society established to do T h eir
Will on Earth; m ay T h ey ever
guard it by Their Pow er, inspire
it with Their W isdom , and en­
ergize it with T heir A ctivity.”
During the last year H e w hom
many of us regard as the vehicle
of the W orld-Teacher, has been
working in the outer w orld,
carrying far and wide H is M es­
sage of Freedom to all w ho are
in bondage of any kind. H e has
dissolved His Order of the Star,
since He looked on it as an a t­
tempt to organize spirituality,
w hich cannot be organized. B u t
H e has sanctioned the form ation
o f five T ru sts, to carry o u t the
physical plane w o rk connected
w ith the physical side o f H is la­
bors. P ersonally I acknow ledge
H im as the vehicle o f the W o rld -
T eacher in o u r w orld, b u t I can­
not, of course, in any w ay bind
the Society, w hich has no creed,
leaving absolute F re e d o m to
every m em ber to belong to any
religion or to none, each m em ber
being responsible to h im s e lf
alone for his beliefs and his u n ­
beliefs, creating his ow n future
by his present, as he has created
th a t present by his past. M an, as
says the U panishat, is the crea­
ture o f th o u g h t; as he thinks,
so he becomes. T herefore let
him th in k u p o n B rahm an, the
Self.
T h ere are tw o m ain dangers,
w e m ay th ink, in the w ay o f the
T heosophical Society, each o f
w hich w e m ust avoid. T h e
danger o f orthodox y, w hich
w ould be its death by fossiliza-
tion; we m ust oppose any tend­
ency— w orld-w ide, racial, na-
290 THE THEOSOPHIST
tional, local, the last in o u r
Lodges— of identifying the So­
ciety w ith any religious, eco­
nomic, political, or social beliefs.
W e m ust avoid tearing it in to
pieces by p arty spirit, the result
of such identifications, w hich
easily cause the creation of p a r­
ties. T h e religions of the w orld
are the partial unveiling of T ru th
— th at is, the unveiling of such
portions of T ru th as are needed
to help the stages of evolution
present at any given tim e. Hence
the com ings into o u r w orld o f an
em bodim ent of the W o rld -
Teacher, in connection w ith the
appearance of a new sub-race.
F or each, T heosophy, the D ivine
W isdom , has its special message
through a special M essenger. If
some of us believe in the com ing
of such a M essenger at the pres­
ent time, we believe because our
T heosophy tau g h t us to look for
such a M essenger, at the present
epoch, in connection w ith a new
sub-race, w hich has appeared in
C alifornia, as H . P . B .— the
M essenger from the H ierarchy in
the last quarter of the nineteenth
century— announced it as com ­
ing in Am erica, (see T h e Secret
D octrine, V ol. ii, p. 4 6 4 ).
I notice th a t m any confuse the
M essenger w ho comes in the last
quarter of the century w ith the
com ing o f the W orld-T eacher in
connection w ith a new sub-race.
T h ey are inclined to reject K rish­
naji as the W orld-T eacher, w ho
comes at H is ow n time, whose
disciples later m ake a new re­
ligion from H is teachings, be­
cause H e has come, as they think,
half a century too soon. He has
come, and is pouring out H is
L ife over the w orld. He has
come “ th a t ye m ay have Life,
and th a t ye m ay have it more
abundantly. " # #
H e a d q u a r t er s’ E vents
A ll o u r extensive and varied
w o rk at H eadquarters has been
carried on sm oothly during the
year, m ostly by the same group
of devoted members whom I
m entioned last year. There have
been b u t few changes. Owing to
illness, M r. S. R aja Ram has
foun d it necessary to give up his
w ork a t the Theosophical Pub­
lishing House, and M r. M.
S ubram ania A iyar, formerly of
R angoon, and a fam iliar figure at
H eadquarters, has taken up that
onerous w ork. T here has also
been a change at the Bhojana-
shala, w here M r. C. Subbata-
m ayya has taken up the post of
M anager, m ade vacant last year
by the tragic death of M r. J.
Srinivasa R ao.
F o r the sake of producing a
M agazine in a form w hich would
m ake a special appeal to the mod­
ern reader, I have transferred the
publication of T h e Theosophist
to America, where, in Los An­
geles, M rs. M arie R ussak Hotch-
ener w ill act as E ditor and Mr.
H enry H otchener as business
M anager. In this I had the
hearty sup port o f the General
C ouncil, and the m ost generous
help from m y tw o American
collaborators. A t the same time
I _found it necessary— in fact,
binding on me as President by
C olonel O lcott's bequest — to
have an O rgan at the Presidential
residence at A dyar; so I continue
to publish from here w hat is now
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS 2 91
called The Adyar Theosophist.
I hope the Magazine started by
H
. P. B. and H. S. O. will in
both parts of its new bifurcated
form (Adyar and America),
continue to win the support of
the members, and those sections
of the public for which they are
especiallyintended.
Mr. Schwarz will now take a
well-merited holiday for some
months. He has had only three
vacations abroad during his long
service of twenty-two years as
Treasurer at Adyar. During the
last year he has also acted as Re­
cording Secretary, but now that
M
r. Ernest Wood has returned
from his travels to take up that
post, hewill act as Treasurer also
in the absence of Mr. Schwarz,
payingback to him some of that
karma which he has so richly
earned.
My Brother Charles Lead-
beater, after nearly sixteen years'
residence in Australia, has re­
turned to Adyar to make his
home here as of yore. For sev­
eral years he has been living in
Australia for nine months and
making a three months' trip to
Adyar. Now he intends to re­
verse that process. I am happy
to have him with me again, for
he is always a tower of strength
and a fount of wisdom. My
Brother C. Jinarajadasa is also
here for a few months, after his
long trip through many coun­
tries of South and Central
America, in which he aroused im­
mense interest in Theosophy,
and was instrumental in forming
no less than three new National
Societies.
Many of our prominent mem-
hood of Humanity, and its Na-
bers were gathered together in
August at the great World Con­
gress at Chicago, over which I
had the pleasure of presiding. I
have elsewhere described it as "a
magnificent success." Many vari­
eties of Theosophical opinion
were there represented, but the
spirit of more than tolerance—
real Brotherhood— which was
there as a perpetual flame made
mutual understanding easy, and
presented a rare spectacle of The­
osophy living and triumphant in
the nearly two thousand dele­
gates who attended the meetings
in the splendid Stevens Hotel,
"the largest hotel in the world."
Our thanks are due to the Joint
Secretaries of the Congress, Miss
Dijkgraaf and Mr. Rogers and
their many helpers, for their ex­
cellent organization of so impor­
tant a function of our Society.
Our Congress took place when
Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, Prime
Minister of Britain, was about to
visit Washington to confer with
the President of the United
States, Mr. Herbert Hoover. Our
gathering took the opportunity
to send the following message to
Mr. Hoover and a courteous ac­
knowledgment was sent me
through the American Embassy
in London.
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
May it Please Your Excellency:
The Third World-Congress
of the Theosophical Society, and
its National Sections in forty-five

UNITED STATES: The Report from
America states that the event of the year was
the third session of the Theosophical W orld
Congress, which met in Chicago in August,
and at which 27 countries were represented.
The maximum attendance was about 1,300,
and splendid audiences came to hear the Presi­
dent’s lectures. During the year, for very vari­
ous reasons, 27 Lodges were dissolved. 8 new
Lodges were organized. As to members— 79
were lost by death and 88 by resignation and
many were transferred to the inactive list. We
took in 716 new members and have now
6,917, 942 less than last year. The Summer
School at Wheaton was a complete success,
with Dr. Arundale as Dean. Nearly 1,000
Theosophical books were donated to 88 public
libraries, but the sale of Theosophical literature
has fallen off about 40 per cent, on account
of economic depression, the dearth of newly
written books, and other factors. The visits
of the President and a number of other over­
seas visitors have done much to revive the
enthusiasm of the American membership. Good
results are anticipated for next year from the
recently started tours of Miss Codd and Mr.
Hodson.
ENGLAND: England has now 5.050
members, 158 Lodges and 52 Centres. 381
new members were admitted, and 485 members
lapsed, resigned, transferred to other National
Societies, or died. Several Lodges have ac­
quired their own premises, namely, Bolton,
Liverpool, and High Wycombe. Students’
Week and Week-ends have been a great success
in various parts of the country, also a One
Day Campaign, in which most of the Lodges
held lectures or symposiums on the Life After
Death, which drew a good deal of press pub­
licity. There have been three very generous
gifts: namely, the remainder of the 14 years'
lease of Headquarters, a small property in East
London occupied by a Lodge, and the M orti­
mer Hall property.
IN D IA : India reports general progress
throughout the country. The minds of the
members appear to be much occupied with an
attempt to understand Krisbnaji’s teaching and
to solve the problems which it raises. The
Constitution and Rules have been revised in
order to remove legal discrepancies and to bring
them into closer relation with present needs.
Newly formed and revived Lodges number 21,
and 16 were dissolved, so there is an increase
of 5. 10 new Centres were formed and 4
dissolved. There has been a loss of 34 mem­
bers, and the active Y outh membership has
fallen from 829 to 722, The Federations of
Central India and Rajputana, and Gujerat and
Kathiawar became autonomous on October 1st,
and promise vigorous work. The autono­
mous Southern Federations have been working
well, but the Northern Federations are not yet
quite so well organized. Conferences and
Camps have been very well attended, and im­
portant educational work also continues. The
finances generally are more satisfactory than in
the past, there being a credit balance, and the
Indian Bookshop shows a profit of Rs. 4,000.
The Headquarters needs repairs, improvement
of gardens, and sanitary installations.
A U STRA LIA : Australia reports a suc­
cessful Thirty-fourth Annual Convention. Its
chief features were addresses by Bishops Lead-
beater and Arundale. and Mrs. Arundale; the
adoption of the Active Service Fund (which
is an appeal for one shilling a week from
every member) ; the re-publication of the
Australian Theosophist as the official organ;
meetings for the Youth Work. Order of Serv­
ice and Education; and the establishment of
the "Advance Australia News Service." The
largest part of the public work has been car­
ried out through the medium of the Theo-
366 TH E THEOSOPHIST
sophica! Broadcasting station, which continues
to pay its way. The Theosophical Society in
Australia can be proud of its radio service to
the Commonwealth, for its popularity is great
and it has earned high praise from many
sources. It also finances the issue of Advance
Australia as a fortnightly newspaper, having a
circulation of 10.000 copies. The News Serv­
ice has in four months secured publicity to the
extent of 253 full columns at least, the news­
papers making much use of the four page
budget of paragraphs which is distributed to
over 500 editors in Australia every week. Perth
and Claremont Lodges have new premises of
their own; in the latter case the actual work of
building was done by the members of the
Lodge themselves.
SWEDEN: Sweden reports that the or­
ganization of the National Society had become
rather loose, but is now being tightened up
again. The work will proceed in a free spirit,
with the recognition that while, as Krishnaji
teaches, a belief cannot be organized, the T.S.
has no creed, and may therefore quietly hold
its old position. It is hoped that this will
bring order into the somewhat bewildered
ranks, and assist the strengthening of a real
nucleus of Universal Brotherhood. The mem­
bership, having been severely revised, shows a
decrease of deadweight to the extent of 340
indifferent members. The sectional magazine
has changed its name to Fri Horisont. The
subscription of shares for the Headquarters
building project goes on slowly. (I hope
some one will tell us the meaning of the new
name.— A. B.)
NEW ZEALAND: New Zealand has 40
new members, while those who have resigned,
lapsed, passed over, and been transferred to
other Sections amount to 113. Still it has a
large membership in proportion to population,
namely 1,074. The sectional magazine, issued
on alternate months, goes free to all members,
and every new member has also received copies
of A Message from an Elder Brother. What is
the Theosophical Society? and The Hidden
Side of Lodge Meetings. The Headquarters’
library has 60 subscribing non-members. The
Vasanta Garden School is making excellent
progress, the eurythmic classes being especially
useful. It has built a new Assembly Hall. The
attendance is 42. The Vasanta Farm, a prop­
erty of 114 acres, presented to the Section 18
years ago with the idea of establishing a Theo­
sophical College and Retreat, is being success­
fully worked as a farm, and the Order of
Service is now fully organized.
THE NETHERLANDS: The new Head­
quarters, opened in July, has attracted many
members and much Press attention. The
buildings form a very remarkable piece of ul­
tra-modern architecture. They include a most
beautiful bookshop and a splendid library.
The membership returns show a loss of 240,
and a gain of 149, the total now being 2,703.
The Publishing House shows great depression
of business, which began suddenly and unex­
pectedly in September, 1928. It is reported
that the dissolution of the Order of the Star
is causing many T.S. members to questionthe
value of the T.S. The Society is alsosuffer­
ing under the mistake which people m
ake is
identifying the Liberal Catholic Church w
ith
the T.S., but it is hoped that Dr. Besant’sex­
pressed intention (not to attend the Church
herself) may gradually improve the sitnatiou
in this respect. The Order of Service isbung
re-organized.
FRANCE: France reports 368 newm
em
­
bers and a loss of 345, making the present
total 3,398. The General Secretary is not
satisfied with the situation as. although there
is no decline, there is a lack of teal progress,
which he ascribes not to the members being
less energetic than before, but to their using
their energy not directly in the Society's w
ork.
As formerly, lectures and classes have beenheld
regularly at Headquarters, but unfortunately
Mile. Aimee Blech’s increasing ill-health now
prevents her from taking part in this. The
Theosophical work in Cochin Cbina deserves
special mention. It is rooted chiefly amongthe
cultured classes—the Annamites. Some of the
members are erudite Buddhists, to whom the
teachings of Theosophy soon become fam
iliar,
and who likewise quickly absorb Krishnaji'e
messages, as they are so closely akin to
Buddhism.
ITALY: In addition to its Notes and
News. Italy has a new Review, II Loto, w
hich
will endeavor to show the unity of life on the
three lines of philosophy, science, and art. The
Order of Service has done good work and is
expanding. 96 members have been lost, aod
54 have joined, the total now being 622.
GERMANY: An extremely brief report
informs us that the membership has fallen from
902 to 745, the reduction being ascribed as
partly due to the influence of Krishnaji’s teach­
ing. The General Secretary is endeavoring to
bring about friendship between the T.S. and
the Anthroposophical Society.
CUBA: Cuba reports benefit derived from
several distinguished or prominent visitors—
Mr. Jinarajadasa, Mr. D. Rajagopal. Mr. L.
W. Rogers, and Mr. Adolfo de la Pena Gil.
With Mr. Jinarajadasa as chairman, a meeting
was held to form a Federation of the Spanish­
speaking countries of North America, namely
Mexico, Cuba, and other Antilles. The Lodges
and members of San Domingo have been trans­
ferred to the Porto Rican T.S., so that they
may have the benefit of the greater proximity.
The magazine has been enlarged, and new and
more pliable By-Laws have been passed.
Membership shows 92 admissions and 217
losses, and the total is now 468.
HUNGARY: Hungary records a year of
steady progress and an increase of members
from 352 to 382. A special Convention of
the T.S. in Hungary, held in May under the
auspices of the European Federation, was a
memorable event, and much strengthened the
position of Theosophy throughout the coun­
try. The Headquarters has continued its sys­
tematic lecture courses, propaganda meetings,
question and answer meetings, study meetings,
and social gatherings. Kindred movements had
REPORTS OF NATIONAL SOCIETIES 367
torem
ain suspended, owing to the strict policy
oftheGovernment. There is an International
Correspondence League, communicating with
m
em
bers in 20 different countries. The Pub­
lishing Trust has been active, and has printed
10 booklets. 5 leaflets, a larger book, and a
sm
all magazine on a printing machine lent by
M
r. Nicholas Miles. The donation of £ 600
presented by the President from the Hamilton
legacywill enable the new Headquarters to be
com
pleted next year.
FINLANDt The T.S. in Finland has an
increaseof 30 members, making a total of 729.
The Twenty-second Convention in the new
H
eadquarters’ building was very well attended
andwasvery harmonious and brotherly. The
propaganda Committee has been particularly
active, sending out lecturers and selling liter­
atureat many meetings. A notable feature was
the work of the travelling bookseller, Mr. J.
Sim
panen, who was sent out for two months,
going from town to town and village to vil­
lage, selling books and distributing pamphlets.
M
r. K
. Unho also travelled for some time.
This work cannot pay the keep and travelling
expenses of the workers, but is valuable if
financedby the Society. The magazine Teosofi
has 1,150 subscribers—very many more than
the m
em
bers of the Section. October was
m
ade a special propaganda month, during
w
hichthe Section had the additional advantage
of a Hindu lecturer, Mr. A. L. Simha. At
V
am
m
elsuu the Society has a summer resort,
w
hich was used by about a hundred members,
com
bining health with congenial company.
The General Secretary feels that the move­
m
ent has entered upon a new phase: “The
living of Theosophy by Theosophists.”
RUSSIA: The "R. T. S. outside Russia"
reports two new Russian Lodges, at Berlin and
B
russels, making 14 all over the world. There
are47 new members and 8 have been lost: the
total is now 356. A Convention was held in
Parison White Lotus Day, with delegates from
London, Brussels, Berlin, and Geneva. The
G
eneral Secretary, Dr. Anna Kamensky, and
M
iss C. Helmboldt have lectured in various
tow
ns. The little magazine Vestnik appears
regularly, in spite of financial difficulties, and
the help given by Mr. P. Raggis of Reval has
m
ade possible the publication of The Voice of
the Silence and In the Outer Court. This is
very precious service, because of the book-
hunger of Russian Theosophists. Every Lodge
works in its own way, and many are active in
various lines of service and in artistic expres­
sion. The Russian Lodge in Tientsin, China,
has been attacked by Christian Missionaries,
but nevertheless has carried on its work
bravely. In addition to her direct work for
the Society, the Secretary has a Chair in the
University, and holds courses on the Compara­
tive Study of Religions, Vedism and the
Bhagavad-Gita.
CZECHO-SLOVAKIA: The membership
is now 108, a decrease of 7. Many public
lectures have been given in different towns.
M
r. and Mrs. Cimr publish a magazine Especo-
Teozoh. which does the very useful work of
giving information about Theosophy to Esper-
antists. The General Secretary remarks that
this work is deserving of help from other Na­
tional Societies.
SOUTH AFRICA: Sooth Africa reporta
an increase of 4 members, the total now being
528. The Annual Convention was notable as
the 21st, the “Coming of Age” of the Society
in South Africa. In addition to its other
work, it approved of the formation of a sepa­
rate Central South African T.S.. to be formed
from its own Lodges. For some time adver­
tisements have been inserted in the principal
daily newspapers of the four Provinces, in­
viting those interested to apply for information
on Theosophy: these have almost immediately
brought in replies.
SCOTLAND: A drastic revision of the
membership list leaves the total now 688, as
compared with 743 last year. The Annual
Convention held at Perth was a very happy
one. with the President of the Society in the
chair. Special mention must be made of the
deaths of Mr. William McLellan and Mrs.
Isabel Stead, valuable and very old workers,
well-known to many of us.
SWITZERLAND: The membership of
the Society in Switzerland continues its steady
increase, this year from 245 to 260. A policy
of very careful expenditure of money and
elimination of all wastefulness has enabled the
Society to reduce membership fees, carry on
vigorous activities, and close the year with a
credit balance of £40. Special mention is
made of the activity of the International Centre
organized by Mrs. Cousins, of Adyar, and
Mrs. G. Kern. Mr. Meautis, the General Sec­
retary, and Mme. Kamensky have been active
in the lecture field. German Switzerland is
especially active.
BELGIUM: Belgium reports an increase of
29 members, the total now being 475. The
Lodges have been individually active, and the
book-selling department has provided the T.S.
in Belgium with good financial support. The
Theosophical Order of Service has also helped
much in the organization of lectures, concerts,
etc. For some years we have had in Belgium
a legal organization, the “Association Th£o-
sophique,” to represent the Society in all finan­
cial transactions. This has now changed its
name to the “Society Theosophique,” so our
Society has now a “personnalite civile” and
can own, sell, receive legacies—and pay taxes.
NETHERLANDS-INDIES: The T.S. in
the Netherlands East Indies reports 1.026
European members. 902 Indonesian and 209
Chinese, a total of 2,13 7, a reduction of 46.
The General Secretary ascribes the decrease to the
rising unrest caused by the teachings of Krish-
naji, sometimes misinterpreted, and sometimes
awakening the people to an earnest self-inspec­
tion which shows them that their place is not
in our Society. He appears to agree that their
place is not within the Society, though if they
are true to their inner motives they will remain
our friends and helpers outside, and he remarks
that the Section is stronger for their absence.
The Society publishes four magazines, pro-
THE THEOSOPHIST
368
viding for Dutch. Malay, and Javanese readers.
The Lodge in Solo has undertaken the transla-
tion of the entire Mahabhdrata into the Java­
nese language, and this has received an enthusi­
astic welcome. (Well done! brave little Lodge,
shouldering so large a task.) There is great
activity in the building of Lodges in no fewer
than five places. Twelve of the Lodges now
own their own buildings, and at some of them
small Theosophical Communities dwell. The
biggest effort this year appears to be at Ban­
doeng, which has raised almost £25,000.
The great event of the year has been the visit
of the Rt. Rev. C. W. Leadbeater, accompanied
by a large circle of old and new friends. He
stayed nearly half the year and visited nearly
all the Lodges of the Section. Great benefit
was also derived from the visits of Bishop
Arundale, Mrs. Arundale, and Dr. van der
Leeuw. The Convention was a great success,
a new stepping-stone for the promotion of
Brotherhood between the many different races
and nationalities in Java. As it was held in
Solo, which is a very characteristic Javanese
cultural centre and the residence of two of the
most influential Javanese Princes, it was de­
cided not to give prominence to ceremonial
work; the Liberal Catholic Church and Co-
Masonry were therefore left out of the pro­
gramme. In June a very successful Summer
School Camp was held in Lembang. The sub­
sidiary movements are carrying on their work,
the educational being particularly notable.
There are now 13 schools under Theosophical
management, with over 2,000 pupils and 70
teachers.
BURMA: Burma reports 301 active mem­
bers, including honorary Bhikku members, an
increase of 8. Most of the Lodges have been
very active, the Youth Lodge, Rangoon, de­
serving special congratulations. The General
Secretary states that by far the best work done
during the year was the splendid distribution
of booklets and leaflets by post. Mr. A.
Verhage contributed Rs. 300 for books, and a
thousand copies of Krishnamurti, Who is Hei
The Sectional magazine has been dormant, but
will now be revived. Nothing has been done
with the land belonging to the Section, and
attempts to sell it have not been successful so
far. The Buddhist Educational Trust schools
are having an anxious time, as the Trust funds
have become involved to the extent of about
Rs. 17,000, owing to the failure of the firm
with whom the money was deposited. The
deficit on the Girls’ School has been made up
by a generous member.
AUSTRIA: The membership has increased
by 16. and now numbers 536. The General
Secretary states that though activity has not
been great, the Theosophical life has been
intense. The Section benefited much from the
visits of the President and Bishop Wedgwood.
The Liberal Catholic Church has proved a
tower of strength to some of the Section’s best
workers.
NORWAY: The principal events men­
tioned in the General Secretary’s report are a
series of public lectures held in the new Head­
quarters, to which many non-members w
en
attracted, and the publication of a series o
f
short booklets on popular Theosophy, w
hich
are doing much to spread the ideas all o
v
er
the country.
DENMARK: Denmark reports 483 activ
e
members, being a decrease of 46. W
e m
o
st
record with regret the death of Mr. A
ugust
Plum, who founded and for 18 years w
orked
for the Blavatsky Lodge at Copenhagen, an
d
was also publisher and editor of the T
beosofek
Tidsskrift. Successful Summer Schools h
av
e
been held at Nakskov and Vadstrupgaard, le
d
by Mr. Edwin Bolt. No books have b
e
en
published this year, but the sectional m
agazine
in its new form has been a great success. T
here
is not much cooperation between the T.S., th
e
Liberal Catholic Church, and Co-Masonry, hut
on the other hand there is no ill-feeling.
IRELAND: The General Secretary regret:
to report once more that not much interest is
taken in Theosophy in his country, probably
because more than three-fourths of the popu­
lation are strictly forbidden by their religious
authorities even to attend our lectures. T
he
membership shows an increase of 4. _T
he
visits of helpful friends are mentioned—inad
­
dition to the President—Mrs. Cannon, M
iss
Codd, Mrs. Yates, Dr. and Mrs. Cousins, and
Prof. James Scott.
MEXICO: The chief event of the year
was Mr. Jinarajadasa's tour, in which in <
2
days he addressed 81 meetings in 26 p
laces
with an approximate total audience of 59,000.
This visit came at a time when there w
asa
transition from the old to the new spiritual
life of the Nation. Most of the listeners w
ere
women, young people, and laborers, a re­
markable sign of the awakening of the N
ational
consciousness. There are now 449 m
em
bers.
The Lodge at Vera Cruz has erected its ow
n
building. Over 80,000 leaflets were printed
on a small press managed by the General S
ecre­
tary. Mr. Jinarajadasa's Cods in Chains is
being published in Spanish.
CANADA: The General Secretary a-
plains that the T.S. in Canada has stood sin
ce
its organization for Theosophy as expounded
in The Secret Doctrine, the early literature,
and the Masters’ letters, while maintaining per­
fect freedom of thought and speech and the
privilege of criticism. He hopes that the Fed­
erated Lodges will see their way to reunite
with the Section, as the harmony that pre­
vailed at the Chicago Congress amid decided
differences of opinion indicated what is possi­
ble. A very successful lecture tour by M
rs.
Hampton, in which no debatable questions
were raised, was arranged jointly by the Na­
tional Society and the Federation. Since the
last report there has been a loss of 73 m
em
­
bers, the number being now 430. M
t.
Smythe speaks of the very valuable work done
by Theosophists who have been active in other
organizations, and instances one who was head
of a Dickens’ Fellowship of 1.100 m
em
bers,
and also the lecturing of Mr. Roy Mitchell in
many fields. The Sectional magazine has been
the chief instrument of propaganda, and the
REPORTS OF NATIONAL SOCIETIES 369
services of several of the very oldest Theoso-
phists have been secured to write articles for it.
There has also been a republication of several
valuable books, including The Evidence of
Immortality by Dr. Jerome Anderson. There
is also a travelling library, which is sent to
anypart of the country.
ARGENTINA: The visit of Mr. Jinaraja-
dasa aroused deep interest among the public,
andmore especially among the members. The
G
eneral Secretary feels "that one of the greatest
results of our brother’s work was to bring the
Argentine soul nearer to the reality of its own
existence, revealing aspects of its own spiritual­
ityhitherto ignored or unappreciated.” It has
beenthe year of the most intense and effective
worksince the foundation of the National So­
ciety. On the administrative side, Lodges and
m
em
bers in Paraguay and Peru have been sep­
arated to form their own Sections. This takes
awaymore than 100 members.
CHILE: Chile reports a reduction of two
m
em
bers, the total number being now 285.
The outstanding event was the visit of Mr.
Jinarajadasa, who spent 40 days in Chile, and
attracted very large and enthusiastic audiences
in 14 of the most important cities. The Gen­
eral Secretary feels very strongly that we are
in the midst of a period of renovation, so that
the near future will find us much stronger and
m
ore efficient in true spirituality than before.
BRAZIL: Reports an increase of three mem­
bers, the total now being 485. The great event
of the year was the visit of Mr. C. Jinaraja­
dasa, which was of great benefit, and received
m
uch attention in the press. A notable feature
has been the fraternization of Lodges, the two
lodges in Sao Paolo, for example, having a
monthly Day of Fraternity.
BULGARIA: Bulgaria reports 200 active
m
em
bers, the same number as last year. Public
opinion is turning very much in favor of the
Theosophical Society. One often hears of its
members as philosophers, religious, truthful,
and trustworthy; and almost all cultural or­
ganizations invite Theosophists for different
kinds of social work. The members try to
reach Liberation by service to other move­
m
ents.
ICELAND: There are now 300 members in
the National Society, 82 less than last year.
Som
e of the Lodges are in a bad way, but
others are getting on well. One librarian records
theloan of 700 volumes, mostly to non-mem­
bers. There is uncertainty in the minds of some
of the members as to the value of our work.
SPAIN: Spain reports a gain of 28 members,
thetotal now being 451. Six of the Lodges are
mentioned as being especially active. The Sec­
tion has to face unusual geographical and eth­
nographical difficulties, on account of the great
variety of types, languages, and diajects. and
the long distances between the principal cities
and populated districts. The independent char­
acter of most Spaniards is also to be reckoned
with. The present political situation and the
power of the Church also prevent the free ex­
position of Theosophy froin public platforms,
but it is nevertheless permeating the thought of
the cultured classes.
PORTUGAL: The number of active mem­
bers is now 202, as against 331 last year. A
large number of members have been dropped
because they have failed to pay their subscrip­
tions. What the General Secretary calls "the
gust of purifying wind from Ommen" has
caused some temporary inactivity in the South.
At the same time the intense clerical reaction
has assumed an aggressive aspect in opposition
to Theosophical development.
WALES: Reports 373 members, which is
15 more than last year. Members have been
active in many ways during the year, and steady
progress has been made. An interesting point
is that the University College of North Wales
sent a request for a representative collection of
Theosophical literature, which was duly pro­
vided. That is a remarkably good sign.
POLAND: This National Society has now
343 members, a decrease of 4. Its main effort
has been to inspire its members with the ideal
of service. A ten days’ visit by Bishop Wedg­
wood was a great inspiration, and Mr. A.
Knudsen also rendered most effective assistance.
URUGUAY: Sends no report.
PORTO RICO: The Theosophical work
during the year has not been so intense and
enthusiastic as formerly, chiefly on account of
deep economic depression following the terrific
hurricane of December, 1928. Certain inter­
pretations of Krishnaji’s messages have also
caused some confusion in the members’ minds.
The number of members is now 300, a reduc­
tion of 41 in the year.
RUMANIA: Report arrived too late.
YUGOSLAVIA: Reports a present mem­
bership of 146. The library has increased to
600 volumes. The bi-monthly magazine con­
tinues and publishes a translation of Dr.
Besant’s Karma. Prominent members of the
Section have given lectures, and Mr. A. F.
Knudsen, described as "the Godfather of the
Yugoslavia Theosophical Society,” paid a visit
for the third time and lectured every day.
CEYLON: Has now 89 members. The
outstanding event of the year is the completion
of the Headquarters' building, the result of the
cheerful and steady sacrifice of many small sav­
ings and a few handsome donations. There is
also a T.S. Sports’ Club. The excellent indi­
vidual work of our members in various organ­
izations is a triumphant justification of our
existence. The Headquarters is always a house
of friendship, where friendly exchange of opin­
ion and harmonious and pleasant intercourse
are possible.
GREECE: Sends no report.
CENTRAL AMERICA: This new Society
covers Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nic­
aragua. Costa Rica and Colombia, that is, all
Central America with Colombia. The sense of
responsibility awakened by the new organiza­
tion has much stimulated most of the Lodges.
The tour of Mr. Jinarajadasa, who spared no
pains and efforts in order to visit all the Cen­
tral American countries, also greatly strength­
ened the enthusiasm and vitality of the mem­
bers. Despite the hostility of the Roman Cath­
olic Church, his lectures were crowded every-
370 THE THEOSOPHIST
where. The number of members is 313, an
increase of 61 in 4 months.
CENTRAL SOUTH AFRICA: This So­
ciety was also chartered in May, 1929, as an
offshoot of the Theosophical Society in South
Africa, which gave its kindly blessing to the
new venture. There are 9 active Lodges with
about 200 members.
UNSECTIONALIZED
CHINA: The Shanghai Lodge has given
up its room in the Nanking road, and hired a
letter box in the G. P. O. so as to have a
permanent address. Its weekly meetings have
been held at the residence of Mr. and Mrs.
Browne. Mr. M. Manuk, Presidential Agent
for China, visited the Lodge and gave two lec­
tures, which were well attended. The mem­
bership stands at 34. The Hong-Kong Lodge
has now 30 members. 79 meetings have been
held, of which 34 were public lectures. Be­
sides giving some of the lectures, Mr. Manuk
conducted weekly classes in The Secret Doc­
trine, The Bhagavad-Gita and The Voice of
the Silence, after which a Star meeting was
always held. The Chinese Lodge, Hong-Kong,
has 65 members, and has given 32 public lec­
tures. It is printing 5,000 copies of Life
the Goal, by Krishnaji, translated into Chi­
nese, for free distribution, the cost of which
has been provided by Commander Cather and
Mr. Manuk. The Lodge also conducts two
night schools, the teachers of which are mem­
bers of the Lodge, who give their services free
of charge. There are 127 students, consisting
largely of office boys and shop assistants. The
Besant School for Girls at Shanghai has se­
cured new premises in Ferry Road, and has
now 381 students. It is gratifying that after
years of disappointing reverses the efforts of
Miss Arnold and Miss Kwai show every prom­
ise of being crowned with success.
EGYPT: Report arrived too late.
CANADIAN THEOSOPHICAL FED­
ERATION: This Federation has now 10
Lodges, with 231 members, a net gain of 4 in
the year. Mrs. Hampton’s tour throughout
the Lodges is mentioned as having been par­
ticularly useful. The Secretary speaks of much
variety of opinion and activity among the
members, but considers that this diversity will
enrich and strengthen the movement.
RUSSIAN FEDERATION WITHIN
THE FINNISH SECTION: This Federation
consists of Russian refugees who are so poor
that they need no Treasurer. In the various
Lodges the studies were chiefly based upon the
methods of Krishnaji.
SINGAPORE: Singapore Lodge reports lit­
tle progress, but a persistency which has made
the Lodge more coherent and the members
more earnest. There have been weekly meet­
ings for the public and Sunday classes for the
members. The library is the chief means of
propaganda. Visits of Dr. and Mrs. Arundale
and Dr. and Mrs. Cousins were much appre­
ciated. There are 15 members.
BARBADOS LODGE: Has now a m
em
­
bership of 30. The President, Mr. G
. C
lyde
Williams, and the Vice-President, M
r, P, P
,
Spencer, have delivered a number of lectures,
and there are regular weekly classes.
SELANGOR LODGE: This Lodge w
as
founded at Kuala Lumpur in June, 1929,
with 11 members, and it has now 13. R
eg­
ular meetings and study classes are beingheld,
and a library is being established.
THE ADYAR LIBRARY: Under the
continued direction of Dr. C. Kunhan R
aja,
the Library maintains its reputation as anin­
stitution of great usefulness to scholars, m
any
of whom have made use of it by personal visits
and also through correspondence. The pub­
lication of the 98 Minot Upanishats with a
good Commentary (the only complete edition
with a Commentary) is now complete, and
beautifully printed by the Vasanta Press. The
Samnyasopanisat and the Rukminikalyanaa
have been issued, and other works are in hand.
Much useful rearrangement and cataloguing
has been done, and there are many additions,
THE OLCOTT PANCHAMA FREE
SCHOOLS: There are now 267 pupils in the
Olcott Free School, and 193 in the H. P. B
.
Memorial Free School. It was proposed to
transfer the H. P. B. School to the Labor D
e­
partment of the Madras Government, but the
policy adopted by the Authorities has beento
assist private agencies with substantial grants
instead of taking over such institutions.
Reports of visitors and Inspectors are very
favorable. The health of the children receives
particular care, and there is daily distribution
of midday food.
THE BRAHMAVIDYA ASHRAMA: The
work has been carried on with typical will­
ingness, in the absence of Dr. Cousins, by M
r.
A. F. Knudsen. as acting Principal. (Mt.
Knudsen is now at Ojai, California).
THE THEOSOPHICAL WORLD UNI­
VERSITY CENTRE IN LONDON: The
report on this subject contains an account of
the history of the movement, suggestions as to
methods which it may adopt, a list of the
activities in the form of lectures at Brompton
Road and in various other places, and a state­
ment as to the financial conditions and the
requirements for the immediate future. These
are all too complex for brief statement, but it
is evident that great and varied activities ate
a-foot, which may become the seed of a splen­
did world-wide Institution in process of time.
INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF
THE EUROPEAN FEDERATION OF
THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETIES: This Com­
mittee was founded to link the T.S in friendly
cooperation with the numerous international
organizations in Geneva, especially the League
of Nations. It has an excellent suite of rooms
in a good position. Its chief activities so far
have been a Peace Week, and various lectures
by Mrs. Cousins, Dr. Cousins, Mile. Brisy.
and others.
