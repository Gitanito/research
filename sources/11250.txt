  		              		Experience Description   

    I was 64 years old.  On March 23, 2014, I had awoke with what I thought was a bad sinus infection.  I took sinus medicine and   I felt really out of sorts.   My husband had left to run an errand and I decided to lay down for a while and fell asleep.  

       I experienced my  body not functioning and I could see 2 to 3 people looking in on me.  I'm positive it was my Dad and my Mother.  It was like they were looking into small window.  Suddenly, I awoke. My legs were jerking and I was trying to catch my breath.  I quickly got up and  and started walking fast, like something had scared me to death.   My husband returned and a few hours later it happened again.  I saw the same people again.   My husband thought I was having a convulsion,  the way I was jerking.   He took me to emergency room.   I was admitted to the  hospital and learned that I had a slight problem with the main ventricle in my heart.  This took three days.   

       Several weeks later, I went into the cardiac lab.      When my cardiologist was putting in the stent, my heart stopped.  So he stopped the procedure. The next morning, I had open heart surgery, which was a single bypass.  I did great.   This was April 14, 2014 and by May 15th I was enrolled in Cardiac Care exercise at the hospital.   I worked out 3 times a week.

  On July 23, 2014, my husband and I went to exercise together at the hospital.   I was in the process of a 45 minute intense exercise on a treadmill.    I was hooked up with a  heart monitor while a nurse watched every part of my heart work out.    I was 30 minutes into the exercise when I went into cardiac arrest.  The bottom of my heart had stopped. I passed out,  fell hard off the bike and busted my head.  There was a Code Blue issued.  

  Here's where my NDE occurred.   I heard two women happily laughing.  Then I could see.   I was up against the ceiling in this huge workout room.   I wasn't in my body.   I describe it as a vapor of me.   Words  cannot  describe the way I felt because it was beyond anything imaginable.     I was so very  happy, peaceful, and content!  I felt feelings I did not know I could feel or that even existed.    On one side of me, it was very bright.  I looked down and saw  my body on the floor with about a dozen people gathered around it.   I could even see the color of the clothes these people had on.   And since I was working out in the hospital center, there were lots of medical staff around. 
  
   I knew I was dead and I DID NOT WANT TO GO BACK.  I could see other people working inside of a glass window like an office building.  I thought that I did not want to go back to that body ever.    There was this indescribable feeling that we do serve an awesome God  that is  so forgiving.  He loves so many people, no matter what.   Then I saw a picture of my husband and  my daughter.   I knew that they would be OK if I went on.   But when my youngest Son, I knew I had to go back. Suddenly, it was like I was falling down a black tunnel.

   I awoke on the floor with people all around me.   The first thing I did was ask for my husband.  He was right there.   I told him, 'I was so happy, I was so happy.'    I kept saying that over and over and on the way to the emergency room and while in the emergency room.  The next morning, I had a pacemaker installed.    

According to the Staff at the workout facility, they could not believe I came back. My husband was prepared that I was gone. It also was the scariest thing the staff had ever experienced and my Husband would say the same. 

  The event changed my life measurably.  Heaven is what it is all about.  Just make the best of life that God has given us.   NOTE:  My son Aaron had childhood cancer.  He was 34 when my episode occurred.   He has had a tough medical life.    I have been with him every step of the way.    I am his angel I think.   He is married and has children, but I am his Angel.

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No

I feel a real personal connection to God   like I've been to visit him but did not get past the entry.   I also feel compelled to tell my experience to people losing loved ones or people near death.    I've found that the ones facing death are so open to my story.  But people who have lost someone are not so receptive.

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   I tried to described in detail above.   Some feelings, I cannot describe    
  
How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  This experience I would put up with my children being born.   At the top.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Yes.   God is real, Heaven is Real, and our earthly life is short.   So many bible verses convey this feeling I have:   Worry, Love, Hate, Resentment, Forgiveness...on and on.   God's word tells us.  We need to listen.  
  
Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Like I said before, people facing death embrace it.    People who have lost or losing a loved one are not as receptive.    People in general love to hear NDE.    It's like knowing your going to win the lottery when you die.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I think about it every day.  
  
What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     I think about it every day.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Let me add.   Most people are very skeptical about NDE, including some  Christians.   But I think they think I am just talking about silly stuff.    I am not the kind of person that does that.  I'm a very private person.  I only talk about my NDE when I feel in my heart it is a good time.    At first, I wanted to shout it from the rooftops, but quickly learned to tell me story to people that have a heart to hear it.   So I do.  
  
Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         It was good.   Seems I repeated a lot.
