     A Review of the Study: Respect in Close   Relationships:&nbsp; Prototype Definition, Self-Report Assessment, and Initial   Correlates, J. Frei and P. Shaver, Personal Relationships, 9 (2002),   121-139. &nbsp;

    Here is a quick, review of   an insightful study on respect and how it figures in relationships.&nbsp; Interestingly,   marriage counselors hear about the two main issues in a marriage as being love   and respect, but respect and aspects of respect have never been scientifically   studied or defined until now.&nbsp; The core relationship values   are defined as respect, commitment, intimacy and forgiveness.&nbsp; This study   removes the realm of respect away from the emotional, and places into the realm   of an attitude towards &quot;a particular person based on his or her perceived good   qualities.&quot;
  
  Respect has long been regarded as the opposite of contempt.&nbsp; &quot;Implicit in   contempt is a view of one's partner as beneath dignity and essentially beyond   the reach of rational discussion&quot; and can be measured by &quot;noticing wrinkles of   disgust and upward eye-rolling, two very dismissive gestures. When a person has   contempt rather than respect for a partner, there is little the partner can do   to get his or her feelings and needs taken seriously.&quot;

This study supported   findings in Lawrence-Lightfoot's studies, published in her book Respect: An   Exploration (2000), when she delineated the six qualities that make   individuals respect worthy amongst their peers.&nbsp; The qualities are: 1)   dialogue (&quot;real communication&quot;); 2) attention (&quot;being fully present&quot;); 3)   curiosity (being &quot;genuinely interested in others -- their thoughts, feelings,   and fears&quot;), 4) healing (&quot;nourishing feelings of worthiness&quot;); 5) empowerment   (enabling others to &quot;make their own decisions,&quot; nurturing their &quot;self-confidence   and self-reliance&quot;); and 6) self respect (helping others &quot;feel good about   themselves&quot;).&nbsp; These qualities are comparable to those found in   studies of &quot;psychological   qualities that allow a person to serve as a security-inducing attachment   figure.&quot;
  
  The qualities identified by Frei and Shaver &quot;included being honest, being   truthful, listening to the other any hearing the other is viewpoint, being   accepting, and fostering the others freedom and development.&quot;&nbsp; Another   finding was that respect is often a mutual exchange whereby if one person   respects another, the other person returns that respect.&nbsp; Likewise, if one   person disrespects another person, that disrespect is returned in like-kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Common attributes of   respect from Lightfoot's research were &quot;deference to hierarchy, often driven by   duty and based on persons positioned, age, gender, race, class, or   accomplishments.&quot;&nbsp; Interestingly, these qualities of respect would imply   that the relationship is unequal.&nbsp; Upon closer inspection of traditional   values, she found that respect in close relationships was really &quot;derived from   the quality, empathy, and connection in all kinds of relationships, even those   often seen as an equal, such as parent and child, teacher and student, doctor   and patient.&quot;
  
  Lastly, I was intrigued by reasons why a person would engage in disrespecting   another person.&nbsp; The core reason is one of avoidance, such that avoidance   refers to avoidance of intimacy and dependence on partners.&nbsp; A person would   be less respectful of their partners for one or both of two reasons: 1)   avoidance caused from prior negative models of attachment figures such contempt   behaviors learned from parents during childhood, and; 2) that avoidance is a   defensive strategy based upon prior attachment relationships.&nbsp; Failing to   fully respect romantic partners may be one way to &quot;avoid becoming emotionally   close to and/or dependent on them.&quot;&nbsp;

The bottom line is that   respect fosters closeness and intimacy with another.&nbsp; Disrespect will cause   the other partner to emotionally distance themselves and become independent in   the relationship.&nbsp; This is truly a shame because the NDE truths show we are   here to experience God's love on earth.&nbsp; And for most people, experiencing   love starts in the eyes of ourselves, our beloved partners, and family.&nbsp; An   impediment to getting close to others, is an impediment to soul growth.&nbsp;   Further, it deprives the person and those around them of ultimate union and   co-creation with God.
