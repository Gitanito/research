we have lost a hundred years of
evolution on planet Earth
a true loss century huge progress was
made in the 1920s as Nikola Tesla
developed energy generation technology
that could power the earth drawing
endless free energy from the so called
empty space around us so-called empty
space isn&#39;t really empty at all it&#39;s
actually full of energy so instead of
being like kind of a quiet empty lake
it&#39;s more like the froth of the base of
the waterfall of something the amount of
energy and a cubic meter of space time
was 10 to the 26th power at 10 with 26
zeroes behind in joules per cubic meter
and that&#39;s enough energy even in a
coffee cup to boil all the oceans of the
earth completely away into steam the
acronym unidentified flying object is a
deliberately office gating term and what
it really is is an alternative energy
and propulsion system they had a piece
of they thought with Plexiglas a
rectangular piece of Plexiglas four
years before they figured out it was the
energy device for the craft and it was
connected in such a manner that this
device could power very small watch up
to a city power was determined by what
the demand on it was and so each craft
had one of these the implications of
free energy go far beyond keeping the
lights on in your home or running your
car without gasoline most of the costs
of making anything from growing food to
constructing a skyscraper is the energy
used to mind the raw materials out of
the ground ship process ship again
packaged
deliver a free energy society in which
the cost of manufacturing and
agriculture moved towards zero would
mean endless abundance for everything
they already exist it&#39;s not like they
even have to be invented you and I the
taxpayers have already paid trillions of
dollars literally in super secret black
budget funding to develop these systems
this is the Society we could have had a
century ago
