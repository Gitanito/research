I was feeling peaceful when an ex-boyfriend arrived and we started really fighting. He started hitting me. I fell down and lost consciousness. I started seeing a light that was very, very white and many people whose faces I was unable to distinguish. They were all dressed beautifully in clothing like large angels. All of a sudden, a voice told me to go back; it's not your time yet. I came back. I didn't know how to explain this to my girlfriend. She told me she didn't know what to do because she thought I was dead for a long time. I never told her what had happened because I was afraid of being ridiculed. But now I am suffering from anxiety and want what I experienced beyond and what happened to me to be true.
