  Morse, Melvin M.D. &amp;   Perry, Paul (2000).&nbsp; Where God Lives&nbsp; The Science of the Paranormal and How Our   Brains are Linked to the Universe.&nbsp; New York, NY:&nbsp; HarperCollins Publisher.

Sample    The sample   is identified as, 'hundreds of children who have had near death experiences.'&nbsp;   These children interviewed are sometimes well into adulthood by the time that   the most recent interview takes place.

  Methodology    Dr. Morse   used observation and interview to obtain his data.

  Abstract    Dr. Morse   had a young patient who asked him, 'what are near death experiences good for   anyway?'&nbsp; This was the catalyst for this book.&nbsp; He covers many topics related to   the near death experience.&nbsp; He looks at the children that he has treated over   the years and finds commonalities among those that have had near-death   experiences.&nbsp; He looks at healing and the different avenues patients take in   curing themselves of terminal diseases.&nbsp; He looks at spirituality and identifies   belief in a master source of goodness in the universe.&nbsp; He looks at what the   skeptics are saying about near-death experience and give his scientific views on   how the skeptics are missing the boat.&nbsp; Brain research is presented in terms of   what areas of the brain are involved in experiencing the near-death experience   and how are they changed as a result of the experience.

  Important Concepts and Definitions    Near-Death   Experience ' experienced by patients who are clinically dead but then are   resuscitated.&nbsp; These experiences are reported as occurring to the subject during   the time that they are no longer clinically alive.&nbsp;

Operationalizations    The   reports contained in this book are qualitative in nature having been the actual   reports of the patient's and family's experiences.&nbsp; There is also an element of   self-report in that Dr. Morse describes his own experiences in the field and in   his personal life regarding people's deaths and leading him to the conclusion   that there is a life after death.

  Major Findings    Dr. Morse   took a look back at the patients that he had as children that had near-death   experiences.&nbsp; These patients now were adults and he wanted to see if the   near-death experience had had a lasting effect on their lives.&nbsp; He found that   these people did indeed display different characteristics from the people that   were in their same age group.&nbsp; He found that the, 'NDE have given them a variety   of unusual abilities, like telepathy or the power to perceive the future (p.   12).'&nbsp; He also found that this group of people was far more 'steady' than their   peers.&nbsp; None of the people in the group had ever had drug problems or even   teenaged pregnancy issues.&nbsp; He found this to be a statistical anomaly for the   size and composition of the group.&nbsp; One father described the transformation of   his daughter after her near-death experience as her not being like any of the   other teenagers he'd been exposed to.&nbsp; He said that, 'she's got drive and   ambition, but it's not mean-spirited (p. 19).'&nbsp; He said that the activities that   she was involved in were things to help others in the community.&nbsp; This he found   as a great change from the person that the child was previous to her near-death   experience.&nbsp; It seems that the changes that the children have made in their   lives since having their near-death experience are much more easily integrated   into a family than the changes made by adults who have near-death experiences in   adult life. </font></body>
