I know that Maharishi University in
Fairfield Iowa and David Lynch
foundation put a lot into promoting TM
with students and veterans and all kinds
of cool balls my interested in the c-5
verticals oh yeah a lot of people in the
meditation movements TM and otherwise
are and in fact I&#39;ve been invited out
there I have never had the time to go
but a lot of people who do meditation
and study the physics behind mind-body
and also the science of consciousness
the fields are very interested in this
so what if anything they have done with
it or would want to do with it I don&#39;t
know maybe a bridge too far because you
know there&#39;s there&#39;s sort of a nexus of
disinformation and auto automatic kook
factor that gets associated with
anything UFO and et and that&#39;s been done
since the 1950s by the CIA and it&#39;s been
very effective so a lot of people don&#39;t
want to lose their respectability by
touching the UFO issue that&#39;s just true
I mean it&#39;s a psychological warfare is
the term used in the CIA document I have
from 1953 where they specifically talked
about the psychological warfare a value
of the subject but also how it could be
basically neutralized and even up to the
point of enlisting very renowned
scientist on the payroll of the agency a
dr. Donald Menzel who was this renowned
astrophysicist at Harvard I have a
document where it names him and it says
it cannot be known that he&#39;s working
with us on this because then it would
lose all credibility but he was the
person who back in that era of 56 would
stand up and debunk all this and then
there was a professor Condon of the
Condon committee at you know University
of Colorado that was in charge of the
project Bluebook the Conant Commission
to look into where their Project Blue
Book the Air Force should be continued
or shut down and so he was the chairman
of the of the committee whether it was
called the Condon committee Co n do n
and professor Condon worked with dr.
Robert Woods who I mentioned is one of
our disclosure witnesses from McDonnell
Douglas and when dr. Woods kept bringing
really hard data cases he dr. Condon
went to the head of McDonnell Douglas
oh man McDonald himself and tried to get
dr. Woods fired I have all this on
videotape by the way and eventually you
know and of course dr. Woods was just so
shocked at this man who was supposed to
be an independent professor looking into
this was so biased after I met with the
CIA director in the 90s I got a tranche
of documents that named dr. Condon as an
asset of the CIA and it says in black
and white so it&#39;s very very well done
from the point if you want to be Mach
abelian and just twisted but it is well
done and for the right amount of money
or threats or inducements they can get
the cooperation of certain people who
have sterling reputations and who can
then ridicule or take the subject down
so the problem usually is is that by
time I emerged on the scene in the 90s
the CIA already had a 40-year run on top
of me of disinformation ridiculing the
subject being sure that things were
covered in the National Enquirer
catapulting to the forefront of the
field charlatans and cranks and all
kinds of misinformation and
disinformation and lunatic conspiracy
theories and so the problem is you&#39;re
you know it&#39;s not like you&#39;re you&#39;re
you&#39;re you&#39;re climbing Mount Everest not
from base camp
we&#39;re from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea
up to the top of Mount Everest and
that&#39;s the problem with a lot of people
who privately will express a great deal
of interest then publicly would not want
to be associated because of the social
opprobrium and ridicule attached to the
subject
you
