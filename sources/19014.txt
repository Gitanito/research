Oh wonderful
that&#39;s where all this started Asheville
North Carolina awesome she is yes I want
to say to thank you to everyone who
sprayed a you know Emily had stage four
cancer I thought she was a goner she&#39;s
completely clear yeah it was frightening
I wasn&#39;t free of people there Verity
National Forest
well it&#39;s all very abstract without
having more detail with what she&#39;s
asking is that she&#39;s had she had an
experience with a fully materialized
craft and subsequently has had
experiences sounds like in consciousness
with someone who&#39;s in the next world as
it were yeah who it has and the thing is
to understand is to look at I call you
know in the ancient excuse me times they
would call this the I of oneness so
looking at this in a unitive way so
there it really is no distance between
these dimensions say the afterlife and
the
a stroll except what our minds construct
because your conscious mind is
omnipresent so your conscious mind can
experience something from an ancestor or
a relative who&#39;s in their astral body of
light whatever in the next world or
spirit being an ancient spirit theme or
an angelic being
I know these all exist or an
extraterrestrial spacecraft in this
dimension or that has resonated to where
it&#39;s moved into astral very close to
what you would call the spirit world now
as I said when the the the Lockheed
skunkworks guy had this his out-of-body
experience with the Astro and he hit the
crap because it but it and it moved it
it was not as materialized but it was
over your head but it was there and it
looked exactly like a craft like this
but it is shifted just into that near
what I call the near astral sort of a
transdimensional energy field and if you
understand that all of this is on a
continuum we create these like barriers
between dimensions so in a sense we
create our own compartmentalization so
we have our bodies we through the 3d
world
everything&#39;s linear and that&#39;s the myth
we create because that&#39;s where our
understanding is but that&#39;s not what&#39;s
actually operating all the time and so
there will be moments where we can break
into and experience something in
consciousness that&#39;s in this another
dimension whether it be the afterlife or
an interstellar civilization that&#39;s
resonating beyond the frequency of light
and matter before it steps down as it
were into 3d but all of it is on a
continuum and the only thing that
separates our understanding it or making
it look like it&#39;s a us versus them or
not an us versus them a yin and yang
thing is the lens we look at it through
so what we have to do is adjust our
paradigm to understand that the whole
cup
that it only camp it does and it does at
all times and from a higher level of
consciousness and perhaps from a higher
level of civilization where you become
interstellar this understanding would be
very very normal and natural okay
from our level at this stage of our
evolution as a society and also as
individuals it seems very strange but I
think it will become less strange as it
becomes more everyday
well the question is when they stop oh
you&#39;re white wouldn&#39;t a craft stop and
land and say hey they have sometimes I
just told you at Joshua Tree we had a
this this sphere come in and there was a
beam there and literally waved it&#39;s on
our website and the question is why
don&#39;t they do this at you know Yankee
Stadium during the okay oh this is like
when Larry King asked me what we little
the White House lawn I probably been
asked that question of the 30,000 times
and and the reasoning but here&#39;s the
reason for it is that and the answer is
really a important answer how successful
has our misadventure been for
instituting Jeffersonian democracy in
Iraq and Afghanistan okay and we&#39;re
dealing with humans living in the same
century on the same planet kind of now
don&#39;t get me started okay now the point
I&#39;m making without becoming politically
incorrect is that if you have a
civilization that is thousands to
millions of years more developed than
ours and they were to come in and force
disclosure let&#39;s say
by being that open a couple things would
happen first there the world would
divide into idolatry people who&#39;d
worship them like the people on the
island making a the plain to bite the
the propeller plane-- or would demonize
them the military and intelligence
community would say we&#39;ve been invaded
and we&#39;re back to the movie Independence
Day okay and it would galvanize the fear
to justify unifying the world as Ronald
sake Reagan said at the UN around an
extraterrestrial threat so if I have
figured this out with my limited
capabilities I&#39;m quite sure these
interstellar civilizations have figured
it out anything that is that frontal
could be what would have blowback that
would not be good so they let themselves
be known in a number of ways they&#39;ve
tested how humans react to that but
again over the course of the thousands
of years of human history and
particularly look at the last 50 years
it&#39;s been quite a bit but they&#39;re still
testing our responses and so and so I&#39;m
trying to answer your question so if I
can finish so the ETS do not want to do
something that would precipitate either
panic misunderstanding and worse the
galvanization of the military using it
like a 9/11 event to create all kinds of
boogie men in space they know that that
is exactly how an event like you&#39;re
talking about would be used I know it
they know it and so the only way that
global open contact is going to happen
like you&#39;re discussing is that if it is
under a ce-5 protocol with a lot of
world leaders involved this could happen
we&#39;re working on this it&#39;s done in a way
that is Invitational and k√∂ppen coherent
if it happens the other way
it could be something that would have a
lot of bad consequences that are
unintended to most people the other
problem with it is that what would be
the purpose in doing that if the people
aren&#39;t ready and you know how I think
they&#39;re measuring how ready we are is
how much we go out there and pull
ourselves out of YouTube and the
television and Netflix and go out under
the stars together and with intent and
sincerity ask them to make contact that
says to them that we&#39;re ready and if we
don&#39;t do that then we&#39;re dilettante and
we&#39;re sitting at home in front of our
TVs being dilettante so I think that you
have to walk the walk not just talk it
and I think that&#39;s what they&#39;re
measuring and there&#39;s many people have
said well you know certainly they would
have cures for cancer and AIDS and and
could do all kinds of yes of course but
the are covert programs have all these
things already also they do it&#39;s not a
myth so they&#39;re watching that there are
certain types of humans that like to
keep all this secret and other types of
humans who are passive or cowardly so
how do we find the our voice how do we
find our our courage to do this in a way
that is really a good event for Humanity
and I think that&#39;s the measure now there
are certain conditions where that may
not happen I think if we had a massive
earth change type event or if we&#39;d gone
to mutual assured destruction a massive
thermonuclear event with thousands of
missiles there the skies would be filled
with ET craft trying to intervene but
short of that sort of just cataclysmic
stupid sort of thing happening they&#39;re
gonna they&#39;re gonna want us to learn and
to because this is our planet we&#39;re the
children of Earth and they&#39;re going to
want us to learn to do this to educate
one another to care for one another to
make contact openly and that&#39;s the
measure that&#39;s the men
they&#39;re looking and even with disclosure
they&#39;re watching to see how much makes
it out that&#39;s true and how much of it
gets folded into disinformation you know
if you read the paper I wrote when
disclosure serves secrecy if you haven&#39;t
read it you should it&#39;s on the website
where disclosure information and
evidence gets folded into the whole
fear-mongering that is the stock and
trade of the UFO subculture so I think
we have to be aware that this is being
monitored by these civilizations who I&#39;m
sure work together there&#39;s no question
about it
I mean if we have coalition&#39;s and we
work together as dysfunctional as humans
are you can be assured that interstellar
civilizations work together with
infinite more coherence than we do that
this is being measured and observed and
there are certain metrics that I think
they were looking at how mass society
media and political establishments react
how military reacts how the public
reacts but also what are the people
doing and at you know having been in the
kind of the center of this for 25 years
now 2015 will be the 25th year since I
found it all this what I what I&#39;ve feel
over and over again is that the real
action is with each individual person
and then coming together and making this
wave happen and I think that for that
reason a forced disclosure by the ETS or
an event happening from on high on
Capitol Hill or the president those are
the two least likely ways and this other
path it just involves more effort and
work but that&#39;s part of the lesson you
know earth is a schoolhouse floating
through space and we&#39;re here to learn
certain lessons about self-realization
but also self-actualization and creating
a new world and I think that&#39;s really
why we&#39;re here together at this time
well we are at a time thank you so much
for being here and stay in touch
you
