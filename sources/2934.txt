INTRODUCTION
"Neither let there be found among you anyone that con-
sulteth soothsayers • . . nor let there be anyone that con-
sulteth pythonic spirits, or fortune tellers, or that seeketh the
truth from the dead. . . . For the Lord abhorreth all these
things and for these abominations He will destroy them at
their coming." Deuteronomy, Chap. 18, vs. IO-I2 (Douay).
This book is about swindlers. Fascinating swindlers:
men and women who practice the most contemptible
form of deception. They take advantage of the mis
fortune of others. They are not like the cheerful
grafters of the circus tent, who short-change the pleasure-
seeking rustics; these fellows snatch up people who are
perhaps in desperation, and then think nothing of taking
their life's savings by means of a little adroit thimble
rigging- Card-sharpers and second-story men are up
right citizens compared to the folk who exorcise their
way through this volume.
These people are known as "Spook Crooks." That
is the title of abuse conjurers and sincere spiritualists
have bestowed on persons who sell predictions and advice
from "supernatural" sources —fraudulent astrologers,
crooked spirit mediums, fortune-tellers, numerologists.
They catch about 30,000,000 people a year, and take
$125,000,000 away from them; in return for this com
fortable livelihood they ruin many of their victims, cause
the suicide of others, even drive some of them insane.

Spook Crooks!
In the chapters which follow, one finds described a little
of the havoc which individual swindlers have left in
their wake.
The Spook Crooks may be contemptible, but they are
clever, colorful, and convincing. Their chief stock-in-
trade is superstition, which in company with mysticism
in one form or another has held the human race in bond
age from the beginning of time. In every age the super
stitious and credulous have been easy victims of the craft
of the alleged prophets of that period. Yet, never in
the history of mankind has there been such a wave of
superstition and belief in the supernatural as now exists.
The bearded cone-hatted diviners of the Middle Ages
were bungling amateurs compared to the modern seers,
the men and women you will find in this book.
The World War brought its aftermath of an increased
belief in Spiritualism through mothers desiring "mes
sages" from their sons who were killed in action. The
widespread use of the radio made millions familiar with
the involved pseudo-astronomical phraseology of the
astrologer and the fantastic mathematical palaver of
the numerologist.
Unemployment drove thousands to fortune tellers.
The seers fattened on the last dollars of the unfortu
nates who asked only two questions, "Where can I find
work"? and "When shall I be employed again?"
Just as the witch-doctor of the African tribes is be
lieved to find the best hunting grounds through his weird
and uncanny incantations, so are the 1932 fortune tellers
supposed to "find" positions for the unemployed.
Superstitions of the jungle inhabitant are not much dif
ferent from those of the city dweller.
Everyone is a little superstitious down in his heart.

Spook Crooks!
How about you? Will you light three cigarettes with
one match? Do you expect bad luck on Friday, the thir
teenth? Or do you think it is unlucky to have supersti
tions? Even if you are not superstitious, perhaps you
think it reasonable that the stars should have an influ
ence on human affairs. And although you can plead "not
guilty" on all these counts, remember how many tall
buildings skip lightly from the twelfth to the fourteenth
floor. The Spook Crooks' stock is an article of first qual
ity, you see, and does not spoil with age.
The second asset of these swindlers is showmanship.
You go to see them, because you think there may be
something in it after all. Step by step, they build up to
an emotional and nervous climax, where your reason
loses all control; then they stop short, and tell you to
come again to-morrow —the spirits can tell you no more
to-day. You come to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to
morrow; until your money is gone. So is the fortune
teller. According to your temperament and the amount
of your losses, you keep sheepishly still, or you go to
the police, or something gives way.
In 1 93 1, there came to the attention of the authorities
many suicides which were directly traceable to fortune
tellers; how many people were sent to jails, asylums, or
the poorhouse I cannot tell. Warden Lewis E. Lawes
of Sing Sing prison wrote me he kept no records of
how many of his charges were started on a criminal life
by the vicious predictions of fortune tellers.
"But," you may say, "how do you know that it is all
swindling? How do you know that the course of the
stars or planets does not affect human affairs? How do
you know that the dead cannot communicate with the
living?" My answer is ready and simple. I do not know.

I merely believe —but back my beliefs with undisputed
facts.
The Smithsonian Institution issued an official pronun-
ciamento (June 31, 1931 ) to the effect that the future of
individuals is not predictable by astrologers, spirit
mediums or fortune tellers; statements such as "Astrol
ogy is the bunk," "Numerology is nothing but plati
tudinous piffle, and not an esoteric science," "The falla
ciousness of astrology ceased to be debatable more than
three hundred years ago," have come in droves from
leading scientists; but I do not know if they know; but
I believe they do.
/ do know however that all the predictions of the
future, whether by astrologers, spirit mediums, fortune
tellers, or mind-readers, of which I have ever heard were
false —and conscious chicanery. And the majority of
these predictions were for the vilest of purposes, that of
falsely obtaining money from the credulous.
In this book I have written down the stories of some
typical victims, have told how the false prophets cheated
them, what happened to them; and then I have explained
the thimble-rigging mountebank tricks by which the for
tune-teller contrived to perform miracles.
You will see how a simple piece of palming which any
amateur conjurer can do, made a mother of two children
kill herself; how an old side-show chemical trick made
an eminent anthropologist lose his mind; how stock
brokers pay comfortable retaining fees for the privilege
of being tipped off to worthless bucket-shop stocks. It
is a long and sordid story, but it deserves to be told.
The characters in this book are real people, the
swindlers (alas!) real swindlers; the means they use to
get "messages from the dead," or to consult the stars,

are the same tricks that charlatans have used for gen
erations. Many of these tricks were the inventions of
stage magicians, who used them for honest entertain
ment. The fortune tellers have stolen these tricks, and
the public is sometimes prone to confuse the honest de
ceivers, the now-you-see-it-and-now-you-don't men, who
give you an evening's genuine enjoyment, —with the low
characters who use the same tricks to ruin their unfor
tunate visitors.
Largely for this reason, the Parent Assembly of the
Society of American Magicians, an organization of
legitimate entertainers, professional and amateur, re
cently started and won many notable victories in a cam
paign against fortune tellers, fake spirit mediums, and
others claiming supernatural powers.
Through the work of the magicians' Press Bureau, of
which I am chairman, I am able to write down the his
tory of the unfortunate cases which follow. Our com
mittee delved into the records of all the false seers on
which it could lay its hands; experiences derived from
the work of the former national president of the Society
of American Magicians, the late Harry Houdini, world's
most famous "ghost-breaker," were capitalized; and our
efforts have culminated in the disbarment of all fortune
tellers or other predicters of the future from the radio.
For example, in March, 1931, there were 147 astrolo
gers on the air; in March, 1932, there were four, at
insignificant stations. Police Commissioner Edward P.
Mulrooney of New York has been making grateful use
of assistance from the magicians in clearing that
metropolis of clairvoyants. All authorities have co-oper
ated to enforce such laws against fortune tellers as
exist, and the days of false prophets seem limited.

The cases detailed in this book come from the records
of many police courts, and from the files of the Press
Bureau. The names and the cities in which the episodes
occurred have been changed and disguised to spare the
feelings of the victims, or in the cases of the suicides,
to save the families from unhappiness. But the facts
remain untarnished and correct.
I am particularly indebted to the President of Parent
Assembly No. i, Society of American Magicians, Mr.
Bernard M. L. Ernst, Houdini's attorney and close
friend, for his counsel and advice, as well as for access
to Houdini's private records; to Mr. John Mulholland,
one of the leading professional magicians, for an in
credibly vast store of technical knowledge ; to Mr. J. B.
Mussey, author of many books on magic; to Mr. Howard
Cushman of the New York Evening Post; to Messrs.
Ernest Davids and M. Robert Herman, my fellow-mem
bers of the committee responsible for directing the drive
against charlatans, for their time, assistance and advice;
and to the members of the Society of American Magi
cians throughout the world for their co-operation and
unselfish aid during the strenuous times when the cam
paign was under way.
The Author.

SPOOK CROOKS!
CHAPTER I
THE GREAT BUDDHA
Stark melodrama rides out of the night into the here
tofore placid lives of thousands for the Spook Crooks are
abroad! Mounted on steeds of superstition they are
sweeping ruthlessly across the horizon of men, women
and adolescent youth leaving in their paths death, dis
honor, poverty and disgrace.
These are not allegorical expressions. These are not
sentences constructed in an attempt at fine writing. They
are but the truth.
Unbelievable tales of fortune tellers' cupidity, diaboli
cal cleverness and deceit have been assembled. There
is no time or space for careful phrasing, for these stories
of the Spook Crooks must pour forth to educate and
alarm the citizenry.
Today, tomorrow, next week or next month, you and
your families may come in contact with one of the more
than 60,000 fortune tellers in America. You must be
prepared to laugh at them, to expose them and to drive
them out of town.
The case histories you read in this, the first complete
expose of fortune tellers, include the most startling effects
of fake spirit mediums, astrologers, crooked mind read
ers and vicious fortune tellers ever written. Fiction
stories? Hardly! Not one of them. For example, come
with me to the "boom town" of Bigwells, Oklahoma.
We arrive in town just in time to see two women

descend from a cheap and dilapidated automobile. They
are dressed in that traditional Romany costume gypsies
have worn for generations. As they get down we note
a huge trailer attached to their car with a gigantic pic
ture of Buddha painted on the sides. The driver is a
swarthy type with fierce moustachios, in keeping with the
picture.
Selecting a nearby policeman the taller of the two
women addresses him. Let us move closer and hear what
is said.
"Pardon, M'sieur. I look for location for my fortune
telling office. Perhaps you help me and I read your palm
and tell your fortune free."
The tall Irish officer grinned.
"Sure 'n' it's all the same to me what the fortune may
be, but I'll help yiz anyway."
Introduced to a renting agent, the women quickly
made a deal. Four hundred dollars a month for a shack.
Money means nothing in an oil boom town—or to a
successful fortune teller.
The following day saw a gaudy banner across the
front of the house.
"MADAM ROSIKOFF. FORTUNE TELLER TO THE
CZAR OF RUSSIA. LOVE PROBLEMS SOLVED. THE
TRUTH ABOUT YOURSELF. PALMS READ. HAVE
THE MYSTIC BUDDHA TELL YOUR FUTURE!"
Madam Rosikoff did a land office business. Not the
cleverest woman in America but a smart one. The friend
who came with her had told her there was no law in a
boom town. She thought the fortune telling business
must be good where there was no law, not that small
fines of careless judges bothered her much anyway.

For furnishing the money for the trip and as well
as giving the tip about the possible profits, the friend
wanted half the proceeds. Never was a fortune teller
more unsuspecting. For the "friend" who made the trip
with her was a "spotter" for a large oil company.
Time went on. The underlings of the oil fields were
daily and nightly visitors. Some wanted their palms read.
Others wanted to write messages to the mystic Buddha
which was advertised to answer all questions privately.
This Buddha was the weirdest, most mysterious device
that any one ever saw. According to Madam Rosikoff,
the Czar himself had given her this statue of solid
bronze.
One merely dropped questions in the metal bowl in
the Buddha's lap and they were answered most mys
teriously in any language. And as there were more than
four dialects and languages spoken in the boom town,
and no one man in town knew them all, the Buddha cer
tainly was a Gift of the Gods, because no matter what
language in which the questions were written, the Buddha
answered them all.
There came a day when a "capper," one who is most
essential in an oil operation, a man of unquestioned
loyalty to his employers, visited the seeress.
A great future was assured him by the gypsy who
read his palm, but besides that he wanted to ask the
Buddha a private question, he said. He gladly paid the
five dollar fee, and with the fortune teller entered the
room in which the statue stood.
He wrote a message on an ordinary piece of paper.
He handed it to Madam Rosikoff who dropped it in the
bowl. She stepped back, took a long black stick, and
stirred the papers in the bowl.

Bowing low before the huge statue she began a weird
chant. Suddenly she broke off, picked up a piece of in
cense and ignited it. As she did so, from the mouth of
the solid bronze statue, in a stentorian voice came the
words :
"It would not be disloyal to your employers if you
bought stock in the X Oil Company."
The "shooter" left the room elated, as well as amazed,
for the question he had written was:
"We shot the No. 4 well this afternoon and it came
in at twenty thousand barrels, but we capped it before
the news got out. Would it be wrong for me to buy
stock in the X Company?"
Madam Rosikoff showed her "silent partner" the
question after the "capper" left the house, and laughed.
The partner left and hurried to the telegraph station.
Wiring her Oklahoma City employers she considered
her "work" done. She had found out what she wanted.
All the floating supply of the X company stock was
bought up privately before the stock exchange opened on
the following day. Then the market was depressed for
a few days. Poor people who should have been "in" on
the profits were frozen out, having sold their stock for
a song. Then the news of the gusher came out. Millions
were made in a skyrocketing market by the manipulators.
All because of a fortune teller.
Not very exciting, you say, except to point out the
gullibility of an oil man who gave away an employer's
secret ?
All right, let's follow Buddha to another town.
You want to know how Buddha works? Why, by the
supernatural powers of Madam Rosikoff!

Spook Crooks!
Here we are in Oilville. The madam's banners are
flying. Crowds are flocking to the fortune teller. A golden
shower of oil money is flowing into her coffers. Suckers?
Harmless amusement?
Geraldine Summers was frantic. She had come to Oil
ville eight months ago with her little daughter Barbara
and her husband Eddie. Geraldine was not quite twenty-
two, Eddie twenty-four. Just a pair of kids themselves.
Eddie had a "swell job." He handled the nitro. A real
"shooter," that lad. He knew just when to "blow" the
well. Got big money, too. $125.00 a week. Shooters
really get paid. He and "Gerry" were certainly happy.
But shooters don't live long if they get a bad break.
Eddie did. They took what was left of him to the com
bination undertaker and furniture man and went to tell
Gerry that Eddie was a "game guy." But that did not
help the girl-mother. Barbara had to eat. She didn't care
so much about herself as she did about Babs.
The thousand-odd Eddie had left, and the twenty-five
hundred the company gave, wouldn't last forever. As
a matter of fact it was fast disappearing for money
doesn't last long in a boom town.
Then along came Madam Rosikoff and the mystic
Buddha who "knows all—tells all." What a break for
Gerry. Also for the fortune teller.
Gerry was ushered into the presence of the gigantic
bronze deity. As the fortune teller burned a joss stick,
the girl-widow wrote a message to Eddie.
"Tell me, dear, what shall I do with the money you
left and that which the company gave me?"
The answer came quickly from the Buddha, loud and
clear :

"Nothing yet, dear. Come back and consult me again
tomorrow."
Gerry went home to Babs somewhat comforted and
startled that Eddie could talk to her through the Buddha.
On the morrow Gerry returned. Taken before the
statue she knelt and prayed as Madam Rosikoff had told
her.
Her reveries were interrupted with a voice that seemed
to come from the very mouth of the Buddha itself.
"I am the reincarnated spirit of your husband. I
will watch over you and keep you from harm. As you
prayed I heard you. For Babs' sake and mine, entrust
your money to Madam Rosikoff. Come often to pray
in this room and I will return and talk with you. Good-
by, dear!"
With a sob Gerry fell over in a dead faint. Revived,
she explained what had happened.
"It really was Eddie's voice," she said.
Half running, half walking, Gerry hastened home.
Here she grabbed Babs, kissed her, murmured that sort
of love talk only a young mother knows, and waltzed to
her bedroom. Here she lifted the mattress, extracted
the two worn stockings in which she kept her money and
went back to Madam Rosikoff as fast as she could go.
Delivering the $3,600.00 to the fortune teller she
went back home.
Yes, you've guessed it. In the morning Gerry dis
covered that Madam Rosikoff had moved.
When she recovered from a swoon, she found her
self in the hospital. While there physicians told her what
she had long suspected, that some day Babs would have
a brother or sister.
She smiled, went home and told Babs, who, being but

two years old, couldn't understand much through the
tear choked voice.
Interesting story? Yes? You haven't heard the end.
For in the morning when police came to get Gerry to
sign a formal complaint against Madam Rosikoff, what
do you think they found ?
You're right. Seated in a little arm chair, with Babs
at her breast, was Gerry. Her golden curls would never
again play a part in "Goldilocks." Her blue eyes would
never smile again. For she was still and stark in death.
Police opened the doors and windows so the gas would
be blown out.
Not a note was left. Not a single scrap of paper the
courts would call evidence against the fortune teller.
Madam Rosikoff —you are not interested in her any
longer? She should be in jail for murder? Surely. No

What? Certainly. That's what this book should do.
Expose the "racket" and protect the innocent, credulous
and superstitious. Fortune tellers may beat the law—but
they can't beat the bright light of publicity that shows
up their dastardly tricks.
Here is how the Buddha works. The "solid Buddha"
isn't—it's just a shell. But it is so constructed that certain
places, when hit with a hammer or other heavy object,
give off the sound of solidity.

This is not a stage trick and is never used by magi
cians. It has been used in small imitation spiritualistic
halls with great effect. Questions are answered on pay
ments of any sum from 50c to $50.00 for a "life read

The Madam Rosikoff of the story has been working

CHAPTER II
JUST EPISODES
Herein are related seven episodes of fortune tellers'
wiles. They are tales of unbelievable credulity, tales
of loss of life, money and honor. Ghosts, "cures" and
feats, sleight of hand, which read ridiculously simple
when explained, but incredibly clever in operation, are
explained in detail.

Nicholas Dempolis was so happy at the thought of
going back to his home in Greece that he forgot momen
tarily the throbbing pain of his rheumatism. He would
be homeward bound in just a few more days.
Twenty-two years of savings had brought him sixteen
thousand dollars, which he had sent back to Athens
little by little, and he had more than two thousand dol
lars cash in the house with which to buy his steamship
ticket and presents for his relatives. He was in a benign
mood.
Tomorrow he'd go to the steamship ticket agent and
then to New York for a few days' visit with his cousin
Popolocatus, who had a fine fruit stand near the Grand
Central Station. Truly America was a great land.
But now that pain again. He'd have to do something
about
it,
but what
?
He'd tried various things, but
a
few
doses of medicine couldn't take out the aches that had

come from years of standing on cold piers in the early
morning waiting for banana boats from South America.
Why, even Dr. Anchovius, the famous physician, hadn't
helped him much.
Ah, well, a few days in sunny Greece would cure him.
Mentally he was picturing the grapevines on his Athe
nian plateau, his family about him.
The doorbell rang. Painfully Nicholas got up, pressed
the buzzer that opened the downstairs door of his
apartment house, and wonderingly waited his visitor.
It was Nick Haskolopious, his former partner, who
had bought out his interest in the fruit store.
"Hello Nick."
"Hello, Nick, yourself."
"Greetings to you. What brings you here, my partner
of other days?"
"I passed a place on Vine Street that had a sign in
its window that said any kind of troubles or sickness
could be cured. It's a gypsy medicine maker. I thought
of your troubles and came to you."
"Thank you my friend. Where was it? I would try
anything." Haskolopious told him. So Nick set out for
the gypsy medicine maker's.
The dim light on the street corner threw in relief a
gaudily painted sign reading:

all fortune telling gypsy women. He seated himself pain
fully and awaited Stergo.
A woman came in. Her face was heavily lined with
age, her beaklike nose jutted out from thin, high cheek
bones.
"Man, you want to see me?" she said in hesitating
tones.
"Yes, lady," Nick told her. "I gotta pain and I want
help."
"You have come to right place. Come to this little
table and I will read your palm."
Seated at the table, the old crone took Nick's hand
and muttered a lot of indistinct gibberish. She stopped.
The silence was intense for a moment, then the fortune
teller broke the stillness with her cracked, rasping voice.
"I see you are a man from 'nother country. You not
be American, but be here some time. You want to go
home soon, yes."
"How did you know that?" Nick broke in. "You must

"
"You came here to see what is matter with your
health. Not so?"
Nick was deeply impressed. He'd forgotten that he
had told her he had a pain when he came in the room.
Of such things are fortune tellers' successes made !
"Cure my pain," Nick pleaded.
"All right, you give me five dollars and I cure you."
Nick paid. The old crone told him to wait and hob
bled out of the room.
She returned in a few minutes with a bottle of green
ish-looking liquid and told Nick to rub it where the pain
was most severe, and to return the following day.
Nick went home, rubbed the aching spots, and felt

better almost immediately. He retired and slept through
the night and awoke without his customary pains. The
gypsy must be good, he thought.
He returned to her the following day for more medi
cine, and while there met a fellow Greek in the reception
room. To him, in his native tongue, he confided the facts
of his return home and was amazed to hear that his
countryman had been treated by the fortune teller and
was completely cured. The stranger said:
"Yes, and Mrs. Stergo also got me a magic charm
when she cured me. What she did was to have me put
a lot of money in a handkerchief and I put the whole
thing in a box and after three days, when I opened the
box, the money was there and with it the magic charm.
Since that day I never have had a bit of trouble."
Conversation broke off here, for the seeress came into
the room. She asked Nick how he felt. Then she invited
him into another room. She told Nick that if he would
bring her a thousand dollars or more she would make
the money work as the cure for his troubles, and the
more money he brought the quicker the cure would be
wrought.
Nick said he only had two thousand dollars and
needed that for a trip to the old country. Mrs. Stergo
explained that made no difference, as her cure didn't
take the money away. So Nick decided to try this new
type of "magic cure."
When he left he carried with him another bottle of
green fluid. When he reached home he rubbed some more
on the rheumatic aches, and the relief this brought con
vinced him that he was taking no chances with his funds.
Therefore he went to the bank and withdrew his bal
ance. As he had already told the bank officials that he

was leaving the country for good, the withdrawal made
no impression, other than to bring him many good wishes
and farewells.
He returned to the fortune teller's home and was
greeted at the door by the soothsayer herself. She con
ducted him into a room. There was a table and two
chairs, and no other furnishings being visible, for the
old lady stated, "If we have other chairs maybe bad
spirits occupy them and knock good spirits away. This
way, two chairs, you and me have them, no one else be
here for they have nowhere to sit down."
This childlike logic impressed Nick. They sat down
and the crone brought out a metal box about four inches
high, three inches long and six inches across. Attached
to this was a heavy key that hung on a piece of rawhide.
"This be magic box," Mrs. Stergo announced. "You
bring out your money, put it in your handkerchief, put
in box, and take the whole box with money into bed with
you. You be cured in two days. Three days it takes when
only one thousand dollars be used, or two days when
two thousand dollars."
Nick took out his two thousand dollars and tied it in
the end of his handkerchief, as shown by the fortune
teller, who moved the box to the center of the table.
Taking the key, which was on a rawhide thong, she
opened the box and turned it with the opened cover to
ward her. She then told Nick to place his money-stuffed
handkerchief in the box. As he started to do so, she took
it from him and visibly placed it in the box herself with
one hand, the other hand being under the table.
As the handkerchief was almost entirely out of sight
she swung the box about and told Nick to lock the box
himself. Nick pushed the bundle, craftily feeling to

see if his money was still in it. He felt a bulge and was
sure everything was well. He closed the cover, locked
the box, and hung the key around his wrist.
"You pay me now," the fortune teller said, "the price
of the box—ten dollars —and also five dollars for the
medicine you had earlier today. Then on the second day
from now come back here and pay me one hundred dol
lars for the cure."
Nick was glad to agree to this and paid the fifteen dol
lars demanded. With the box under his arm in a deathlike
grip, the happy Greek left the house.
The two days passed slowly. Nick's rheumatism both
ered him, but he supposed it would be all cured as soon
as the time was up. Finally the two days had passed.
He could hardly wait to open the box. He inserted the
key and threw open the cover. Pulling out the handker
chief he was shocked to find only some newspapers cut
to the size of money
fly
into the air. He looked for his
money, but not
a
trace of
a
greenback could be found.
Rushing to the gypsy's house he found the sign gone
and the house unoccupied. Realizing what had happened,
he dashed to the nearest police station and related his
story.
"Handkerchief switch," the detectives said laconically
as they conducted Nick to the warrant officer where he
swore out
a
warrant.
But the gypsy had vanished and the warrant still re
poses unserved in police headquarters at Philadelphia,
in
the shadow of Independence Hall. And Nick had to
postpone his trip home.
Without the metal box
it
would have appeared to
have been the customary "Handkerchief switch" theft
as described
in
detail in Chapter VI.

investigated the story of Nick.
In the first place, the Greek Nick met at the fortune

perfection.
Probably she figured the two thousand dollars she
got from Nick was sufficient pay for her to leave it be

The metal box, which rests on the table, has a sliding
bottom. While the fortune teller kept the visitor's atten
tion on her right hand, her left hand had pulled out the
slide of the metal box and also released the trapdoor in
the table top. Note the diagram on page 30.
As she dropped the handkerchief with the money pre
sumably into the box, but actually through the trap into
a compartment, her left hand was pushing the handker
chief of cut newspapers up into the box.
After the exchange was made and the trap quickly
and silently closed, all she had to do was to hand the
dupe the box and let him lock it himself.
The green mixture that had made Nick feel better,
after analysis proved to be a liniment, sold by the mil
lions of bottles, for rheumatism. It simply brought tem
porary relief. But, of course, it prepared Nick to be an
easy victim.

Helene Marsden lived with her husband, a con
tractor in a small town outside of Los Angeles. The
Marsdens had a comfortable house; Helene had a maid
to help her, and had two sons and a daughter.
Early in January of this year Helene met an old
friend, Sarah Bellow, from her home in Ohio, who said
that she had come to California looking for a wonderful
clairvoyant. This man, denying he was a true believer
in spiritualism, Sarah said, brought spirit music out of
the air. The seer had vanished, according to her story,
but Sarah had traced him to the city where Helene lived.
The name of the medium —no other name is known
in the light of further events—was Hart Andos. The
story Sarah related was to the effect that Andos had been

a great musician, but had lost his arms in a railroad
accident. While he was recovering in an Ohio hospital
his room was suddenly filled with music, from violins,
guitars, banjos, and other instruments. No explanation
was found until a Cleveland spirit medium visited the
hospital and heard the music. He pronounced it the work
of spirits, she explained.
Sarah further said Andos had brought her many mes
sages from her dead husband, but had moved to Cali
fornia.
That was why she was in town, for she wanted Andos
to get a new message from her husband. She wanted to
know how to proceed in certain personal matters for,
she said, previous advice from her dead husband, that
Andos had received in her behalf, had turned a certain
real estate deal to her great advantage.
Helene offered Sarah the hospitality of her house
while she remained in town, and Joe Marsden, although
stating privately to Helene that he took no stock in the
story of the miracles, agreed to let her chum of school
days remain.
A few days sped by, when Sarah announced that she
wanted Helene to visit him. So together they went to
see him.
Sarah explained that she wished an immediate seance.
Andos was willing, so both girls and the medium retired
to a large, heavily curtained room.
The medium sat down at a huge old dining room table,
and the women took seats on either side of him.
"I want to point out that most of the music which you
will hear will be well known Christian hymns," he ex
plained. "It will be music played by mysterious instru
ments, the like of which you have never heard."

"I will not completely darken the room, but will have
illumination from the floor lamps throw some light on
the table. I am now ready to proceed. Place your hands
on the table, press heavily and be silent while I commune
with the dead. Shortly you will hear the clear tinkle of
these unearthly musical instruments playing favorite
selections. As the first hymn ends, ask me what you will."
Silence reigned. The women's hands were white and
bloodless as they pressed hard on the table. Andos had
both armless sleeves in full view.
Suddenly there came the strains of "Silent Night,
Holy Night." The slow, reverent music came from the
very center of the table; from under their hands! It
was unbelievable!
The music ceased.
"Ask your questions now," the seer commanded.
Sarah did.
"Shall I buy any of the ten stocks that my broker
advises ?"
The room was again filled with the sweetest music.
"Onward Christian Soldiers" was being played softly,
yet with great volume. Helene was filled with the dread
of the unknown. Sarah seemed intent on the medium's
answer.
"Buy no stocks now," he said, "for there are trouble
some times ahead in Europe. Stocks will fall, nations
will tremble, and later on you will be able to buy securi
ties at much lower prices."
"May I ask something?" Helene whispered to Sarah.
"Certainly."
"I want to . . ."
As Helene started to speak the music changed into
a rollicking march.

"Please tell me if my brother is alive," Helene gasped.
The strains of Sousa's "Stars and Stripes Forever"
almost drowned out the medium's answer.
"Your brother lies with the honored dead in France,
but his spirit bids me tell you all is well with him."
Helene's smothered scream seemed to wake the
medium from his trance. Helene really had lost a brother
in service. He had been reported "Missing in Action."
The music stopped. The room was deathly still.
With labored breathing, speaking jerkily, Andos di
rected Sarah to pull up the blinds. As the light filled the
room from the afternoon sun, Helene stared about to
see if there was a radio or phonograph in the room.
Reading her thoughts, the medium said, "Please examine
the room for radio wires, concealed speaking trumpets,
phonographs, or anything that will explain the psychic
phenomena you have seen."
The girls looked the room over, Helene in a half
frightened, half skeptical manner. She even knocked on
the walls to see if they were hollow. Convinced that they
were all solid, and that nothing was concealed that could
have produced the music, she was more awed than ever.
She paid the medium a fee of ten dollars and left
with Sarah.
That evening, when Joe came home from his office, she
related her experiences and begged him to go with her
to another session.
Joe reluctantly consented to accompany the woman
to a session the following night. He met Andos. As a con
tractor, he did more than tap the walls to see if they
were solid. He thumped them. He peered out of the
windows to see if there were loud speaker connections.
After he was satisfied, the medium took his seat.

"Tonight we will have to use flash lights," he said.
"There is no gas or electricity in the room. If there were
light sockets, chandeliers, or connections of any kind,
you might suspect the music that was heard was earthly
radio and not spiritual."
And then the same performance, with the same inex
plicable music, took place, and Helene's brother in spirit
gave many family details to confirm his authenticity.
Joe was half convinced and promised to come again.
The fame of Andos and his spirit music spread through
the town. Soon every one was flocking to his seances.

Early in September of this year a newspaper headline
stated :
KILLS SELF BECAUSE OF SEER'S CURSE
Helene Marsden, 38-Year-Old Mother of
Three, Takes Poison to Escape
Wrath of Fortune Teller
To the writer, in his capacity of Chairman of the
Press Bureau, Parent Assembly No. i, Society of Ameri
can Magicians, came clippings telling the bitter story.
Queries to a reporter in the city wherein the suicide
took place brought forth a story of cunning and vicious-
ness.
It seemed that Helene had developed a small cyst
on her breast which doctors thought might be an ulcer
or boil. But Helene, by then under Andos's spell, showed
the sore to the man, and asked his advice. He pronounced
it cancer (while in a trance), saying the spirits had told
him so.
He further ordered her to come to him for treatment

regularly —"spirit healing" he called it. Helene did,
without telling her husband. From March until Sep
tember she went four times a month, paying ten dollars
a visit. Helene told her husband she was spending the
money for doctor's treatments for the cyst.
Early in September Joe decided to take Helene to
another doctor, for the cyst showed no signs of abating.
Helene went reluctantly. After the examination, the
doctor said emphatically that the sore was nothing
serious and there was no need to go to any one for fur
ther treatment. He gave her a salve and said that would
stop the trouble.
The following day, Helene, in fear and trembling,
went to the seer. She explained she was going to stop
coming, as the doctor said there was nothing seriously
wrong with her.
The fortune teller rose in terrible indignation and put
the "curse of Arradaba" on her and her whole family.
Helene, terrified, sobbing, ran home.
Rushing to the bathroom she took a bottle of car
bolic acid and drained its contents. Her piteous cries
for help brought the police and a city ambulance.
On her death bed, with her head in her husband's
arms, she told the story of what had led to her unhappy
act.
Let the authorities' official report tell the story:
"To the Commanding Officer, Detective Bureau:
"Following up Mrs. Marsden's deathbed statement we went
to the house where Andos lived. We found him and arrested him
on a charge of prescribing medicine without a license, fortune
telling, and obtaining money under false pretenses.
"We attempted to book him as an accessory to a homicide, but
the district attorney said this charge would not hold.

"Careful search of the house disclosed the source of the secret
music that caused Mrs. Marsden and others to fall victims to this
faker's fraud.
"Under the table on which the sitters place their hands, was an
old style Swiss music box. From that came this spirit music. There
are four separate disks held under the table in alignment with a
metal arrangement which lets the operator change them almost
without a motion by using his knee.
"The fact that Andos hadn't any arms (a fact verified by the
police surgeon when we booked him) kept suspicions from him.
"On the way to the station house the music box fell from the
police wagon and was somewhat damaged. I think that this music
box was the same one used by Florence Rose, that fortune teller
we pinched last year. She recovered the box after she was fined.
This box will never do anyone any good again.
"Respectfully submitted,
"Harris, Lt. Com. Det. Bureau"
"Music from the air" is one of the most common of
all methods of impressing victims. The music box
method, the radio phonograph method and the concealed
musician are the three methods most commonly used.
No sincere and genuine medium has ever produced
"spirit music" for a body of psychic phenomena investi
gators.

Here is an interesting letter:
"Thank God for the good work the magicians and you
are doing in exposing these terrible fortune teller fakers.

line for promotion to foreman, when I met a Mrs. ■
who was introduced to me as a great medium.

"To make a long story short she did many things that
got me half batty with messages coming to me from the
spirits on paper which I wrote my name on. This abso
lutely blank paper with nothing on but by own signature,
this medium would wave about in the air over a stove in
her kitchen, or maybe over a candle, and real messages
came.
"Well, I got so I went to her house almost every night
on the way home and every Tuesday payday, I always
went and gave her half or more of my pay. I know you'll
think I am crazy, or was crazy because I don't go any
more, but it got so that my wife wouldn't talk to me and
finally went home to her mother.
"After she left me I began to drink pretty bad, we are
near the Canada border, so I lost my job because Mr.
won't have drinkers about. Well, I got the bugs
from the liquor and went to the Hospital as a police
case because I slugged a cop when I was drunk. When I
got well, the judge pardoned me, when I told my story,
with a suspended sentence, and the cops went after the
medium but she had moved.
"Now I am out of a job doing only what work I can
get, have not got my wife or little girl back, and all be
cause of this faker. I hope you truly get after them all.
"Yours truly,
"Edward C ."
"P. S. I know those spirit messages were fakes, but
how were they done ?"
The author checked the statements in the above letter

firmation, from the judge who suspended sentence, which
just came which proved its authenticity. The facts in

the letter are substantially true and are passed on here
for the reader's consideration.
Back of this letter is a story that needs no words, a
story of disaster, wrecked home, poverty, loss of position,
trouble, and calamity.
There are two reasons for reproducing the letter
First, to show the damage done a hard working man of
good reputation, and, second, because the question. "How
were the fake messages done?" brings to mind the fact
that thousands of fortune" tellers are working with in
visible inks to bring "messages from the spirits."
To start with, it is obvious, even to an untrained ob
server, that any messages which appear on blank paper
come there because of some material method. Spirits
don't write messages. Hence there is only one solution of
the mystery: some kind of chemical is used.
Herewith are ten chemical compounds used for in
visible writing together with the methods of applying
them.
Method I.—One of the best methods of making writ-\
ing invisible is to write with a concentrated solution of J
caustic potash. Use a new pen and write as finely or / ^p/i?'T
broadly as you wish. Let the paper dry and writing is V
absolutely invisible until strong heat is applied. Inci- f (
.
dentally, many spies during the world war wrote mes- I
sages underneath ordinary correspondence with caustic I
potash, for it is easy to obtain at any drug store. J
Method II.—Procure some rose-colored paper. Write
on it with a solution of cobalt chloride. The writing fades
on drying, becomes visible in deep blue when heated, and
disappears again when cool.
Method III.—Buttermilk or ordinary milk makes ex
cellent invisible ink, although the former is better. Write

what you please on unglazed paper with the buttermilk,
let dry, and it can be developed out later with a hot flat
iron.
Method IV.—A little known fact is that the juice of
lemons, onions, leek, cabbage or artichokes make excel
lent invisible inks. Simply dip the pen in the juice of any
ione. When the writing is dry, the characters become
strongly visible when the paper is waved over a hot lamp
or stove. This method has been used by convicts to
smuggle out messages from jails.
Method V.—Another war time invisible ink is made of
ammonium hydrochlorate in the proportion of fifteen
parts of one hundred. Any druggist will make this up for
you. The writing of this solution becomes visible when
held over a stove, or (as women spies did in the war),
when passed through a heated hair curler.
Method VI.'—A slightly alcoholic solution of copper
bromide makes a good invisible ink, as the writing be
comes visible without need of too much heat, and also
fades away quickly as the paper cools. Many a chemical
student has used this method to write his best girl when
her father objected to his young devotions.
Method VII.—A pretty invisible ink is made of nickel
chloride and nickel nitrate in weak solutions. The writing
from these chemicals becomes green by heating.
Method VIII.—A weak solution of mercury nitrate
becomes black on the paper when heated. This method is
used where the invisible messages must stay for quite a
period. It makes the characters appear in a heavy black
color.
Method IX.—This is probably the most popular war
time method and was used by the spies because the paper
destroys itself, after the message is read. Take some

ordinary sulphuric acid. Reduce it with water until the
lines of the pen are not visible on the paper after two
minutes. Then write your full message. After the heat is
applied and the characters become visible, the acid eats
and destroys the paper.
Method X.—This is known as a reagent method, no
heat being needed. Use a weak solution of lead acetate,
made by reducing the chemical in distilled water. (Your
druggist will make a bottle of it for you.) Write your
message. It is absolutely invisible in two minutes, and
neither heat, light nor water will make it visible. A solu
tion of alkaline sulphide powder poured over the paper is
all that will bring the writing to view.
There are many formulas and methods of using invis
ible inks, but these ten are in most common use with me
diums. Never believe your own eyes if a fortune teller
makes "writing appear with the aid of the spirits." The
"spirits" he talks of must be in the chemicals.
Mr. 's letter is answered. It's too bad he did not
have the knowledge of invisible inks that you now have.

To A small Western town of about eighteen thousand
inhabitants, early this year came one who called himself
"Rajah Remarkable." He advertised in the local papers,
claiming to be an "Oriental Seer and Spirit Medium."
One of his advertisements, a large spread in heavy
black type, carried this amazing message to the world:
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

Among the readers of this ad was Alice Andrews,
pretty, petite, twenty-two, daughter of a prominent local
attorney. She was madly in love with George Carter, son
of "oF Doc" Carter, the country practitioner who had
brought Alice into the world.
Alice wasn't so sure that George returned her love, for
early that week George had taken Mabel Harris to a
dance to which she herself had "just been dying" to go.
She decided to ask the Rajah about George.
Alice almost ran the entire distance to the Rajah's
"Salon of the Orient." Entering, she was greeted by a
huge turbaned Negro, who salaamed and bade her to
wait; but it was not long before she was conducted into
the private sanctum of the seer.
Here she found an oriental setting, in the center of
which was an ordinary table covered with a number of
slates, tablets, incense burners, and some small pieces of
regular drawing paper. The seer sat at one end of the
table, and Alice was told to occupy the seat at the other
end. '
Alice was upset and excited, although outwardly calm.
Creepy, uncanny and spooky feelings ran up and down
her back as the Rajah's penetrating eyes pierced her. Yet
nothing he said was out of the ordinary.
As the Rajah gave her one of the pieces of drawing

paper, he let his eyes rest on her hand, stating in a deep
voice :
"Write your name at the top of the paper. Put your
address and age underneath. Then the month of your
birth, and directly under that write the questions closest
your mind and heart."
With these words he handed Alice a pencil and stood
up. As he walked away from the table he commanded her
to write only so long as his back was turned. Alice did as
she was told and, after writing, called the Rajah back to
the table.
Resuming his seat directly opposite her, he told her to
fold the paper in half and then again, and place it in the
center of the table. This done, Alice leaned back in awe
as the seer picked it up between two fingers and deftly
carried it to his forehead with his right hand, placing his
left hand on his other temple.
He called her by name, and said George did love her,
but he needed to ask the spirits just what should be done
to make him propose. This first session cost only three
dollars, but for a more complete "reading," in which
"spirits were involved," the fee was ten dollars. Alice
left, much impressed, because the seer had called her by
name and had most impressively stated that George did
love her.
Returning the next day with the ten dollars, she was
ushered into the same room and felt that uncanny near
ness of the mysterious. The Rajah gave her two slates to
wash, without any preliminaries. Then she was told to
place a piece of chalk between them and tie them to
gether.
The Rajah seemed to be working rapidly—"urged by
the spirits," he said.

After the slates were tied, with the chalk between, he
gave Alice a roll of adhesive tape and told her to seal the
slates together and mark her initials on the tape to iden
tify the slates. Then he took them from her and placed
them underneath the table.
His movements grew faster and faster, then suddenly
he grew languorous. He asked Alice to "concentrate on
George" while he went in a trance.
After a few minutes of "conversation with the spirits"
he brought the slates from underneath the table and
had Alice unseal them.
Lo and behold, in rather shaky writing, but legible, ap
peared these words: / am Alice's grandmother. In
George's heart is a place for her, but not yet. Ask me
again in three days.
Alice was paralyzed with amazement and much im
pressed. She paid the ten dollars and left, happy and con
tent in her belief in the Rajah.
She came again and again, waiting for the right mes
sage, until finally, after her money gave out, she told her
father, a lawyer, of her visits and asked for more funds.
Luckily, he investigated, with the result Rajah Remark
able was run out of town. The father did not wish to
prosecute because of the publicity it would bring to Alice.
A famous magician and former college professor, was
lecturing on magic and physics at a college in this town
some days later when he met Alice's father, who told him
the whole story. While Mr. Andrews knew the thing was
a fake and of the worst kind, he did not know how it was
done. The Press Bureau wrote him a complete explana
tion of the fraud.

we wrote, "for cold statistics show us that more than

$125,000,000 is given up by a credulous public yearly to
fortune tellers, fake mediums and clairvoyants who pre
tend to read the future or receive messages from the
spirit world. In New York alone about $60,000,000 is the
gain of these frauds who prey on superstitious or gullible
people.
"According to the records of various police depart
ments, one finds about four convictions for every hundred
working fortune tellers. Victims shrink from signing
formal complaints or appearing in court; the publicity is
dreaded.
"The best way, therefore, to save the public from itself
is to expose the methods used. Therefore, the most care
fully guarded secrets of fortune tellers and mediums are
being revealed by the Parent Assembly of the Society of
American Magicians, the arch foe of fortune tellers.
"The means of learning Alice's name, address, and the
questions is the most common trick used by mediums and
fortune tellers. It is known as the 'office switch.'
"While Alice wrote her name and question, the Rajah
had concealed in his right hand a duplicate piece of paper

"When she placed her folded question in the center

the same time, and it was an easy thing for him to switch
the papers.
"Look at the accompanying illustration. He shifts the
folded blank paper in his left hand to his right and Alice's
message to his left hand, concealing the substitution.
While he lets a corner of the blank paper show from be

his left hand to his lap, deftly opens Alice's message and

read it, reverse his palming hiding process, replace the
original paper in his right hand, and drop the left hand,
with the blank message, in his pocket in a natural man
ner. Many mediums get rid of the blank, or duplicate piece
of paper, by drawing out a handkerchief.
"The slate writing part is most convincing and uncanny,
even to a magician, or one versed in medium's wiles, un
less he is familiar with chemistry and physics. Alice actu
ally did seal the two slates together, after the piece of
chalk was placed between them. The slates are 'real,'
meaning untampered with—some mediums permit the
dupe to bring his or her own slates. But the secret lies in
the chalk itself.
"Seemingly nothing but an ordinary piece of chalk
which one may buy in any store, it is actually the entire
secret of the trick! It is pulverized chalk mixed with a
little water, glue, and iron filings, molded and allowed to
become hard.
"The medium, after the slates have been sealed with
the chalk between them, places them under the table.
While they are out of sight he brings out unseen a small
but powerful magnet and traces with it the words he
wants to appear. As he writes the magnet pulls the chalk
along noiselessly ! The greatest skill is needed to do this
stunt, as the writing must be done backward.
"The iron filings in the chalk naturally follow the mag
net, and while the writing is always somewhat shaky, it
is always readable. Naturally, no one expects a spirit
to write Spencerian or Palmer methods.

Virginia worked in the First National Bank. She was
a check sorter. Virginia was twenty-four this summer.
Pretty, gullible, happy, and a girl on whom the rest of
the world smiled. She lived with her mother, a widow,
on the outskirts of town in the house in which she had
been born. She drove to the bank each day in a second
hand flivver.
Part of the perpetual happiness of Virginia, Ginny to
her friends, was her friendship with young Arthur Lee,
who was twenty-seven and wanted to marry her.
They were at a party one night when one of their
friends, Pauline Jones, met them breathlessly with this
announcement :
"There is a fortune teller in town, down at the Spiritu
alist Hall, who is wonderful. He told me I was going
to marry this year, that I didn't know the man very well
yet, but that it was certain I would get better acquainted
with him this month and before six months were passed
I'd be Mrs. So-and-So !"
"Ginny," Arthur cried, "let's go to see what he says
about us."
So Ginny and Arthur and the rest of the party went
down to the Spiritualist Hall. There was a banner outside
reading: "Rajah Ahmet, Prophet."
The prophet was garbed in the traditional turban of
many colors and stood on a small raised platform. A
large crystal ball was in a small stand. The Rajah was
rubbing his hands together. He reminded one of a cat
licking its chops.
"My friends," he opened sonorously, "you are gath
ered to see a miracle, the reading by the spirits of unseen
messages sealed in light-proof envelopes. Not alone will
these messages be read by the spirits, but the proper

answer will be given to each of them by the same spirits.
And this message will in turn be given by me to you, for
I will see the truth in the crystal, and then pass it on."
The Rajah distributed envelopes, paper and pencils to
the audience.
Then he spoke again.
"My friends, as you write your question, keep your
mind concentrated on it. As you finish writing, raise your
hand, I will then collect the questions.
The Rajah held the tray high so that every one could
see that he did not touch, substitute, or change the en
velopes. He placed the tray and questions on the table on
the little platform. He put the crystal ball and stand on
one side of the tray. "To insure the spirits being close
to the questions," he said.
Quickly, one right after another, the Rajah answered
each question. He seemed not to touch the envelopes at
all, except to move them aside when he had answered
the question contained in them.
When he came to Ginny's question, he said : "The ini
tials 'V. R.' come through very strong. This person, a
girl, has a very nice answer coming to her, but it's a
little too personal for reply in public. Wait after the
seance is over, and I will give you a private reading."
Ginny's question had been :
"If I marry Arthur will I have to leave my position
in the bank?"
Setting the crystal ball aside, the Rajah picked up the
tray and came down in the audience with it.
"Pick up your own envelopes, friends," he said. "Note
they are unopened and not tampered with at all !" It was
a miracle !

agreed to wait downstairs for her. Ginny fell under the
Rajah's spell. She told him much more than he told her.
The Rajah in the end, predicted Arthur and she would
be married. She was very happy.
Two days went by.
Rajah Ahmet came to the bank where Ginny worked
with a check on a New York bank signed by a well known
broker. It was for four thousand dollars. The paying
teller refused to give the cash for
it,
so the receiving
teller took
it
for collection.
That night, at home, Ginny received
a
telephone call
from the Rajah. He had phoned to state that the spirits
had just come to him to say that Ginny's and Arthur's
first child would be
a
son. Ginny flushed, even though
the fortune teller was
a
long way away. In the midst
of her embarrassment, the Rajah explained about the
check.
"Would Ginny,
in
her capacity of check sorter, tell the
paying teller to release the four thousand dollars?"
"Surely."
First thing in the morning, the Rajah appeared at
the paying teller's window. Was the check O. K.
?
Could
he have the cash? Ginny O.K,.'d the transaction. The
Rajah got his cash and off he went.
Shortly after the noon hour came
a
telegram.
Hold Rajah Ahmet for forgery.

Let's pass on. You can draw your own conclusions as
to the disgrace and unhappiness another fortune teller
had caused.

There was a small light in the crystal ball that was

Fake mediums make use of the death columns as
leads. Here is a letter which has just come into my hands,
which proves this fact beyond doubt.
ALLAH AHASSAD
Oriental Seer and Spirit Medium
Dear Mr. Kane:
After four months I am at last happy to tell you that I can
arrange a meeting with the Master and you. Conditions are now
favorable for you and your family to get in touch with those in
the spirit world. Phone me for an appointment. The Master
will tell you exactly what you want to know about your health
(you recall you were worried about this), business affairs, etc
The Master's fees are only ten dollars for a consultation, but
even if they were ten times ten dollars, what you would learn
would be well worth it. He may be able to materialize a spirit,
or, if not, he can bring you a message from some relative in the
spirit world.
Phone as soon as you can for an appointment, as the favorable
conditions may not last.
Very truly yours,
Grace Hardy,
Secretary.

Inasmuch as this letter was delivered two days after
Mr. Kane's death, you can readily see the effect it had
on Mrs. Kane. Her instant desire was to see the "Mas
ter" seer at once. Read the letter carefully. Note that
he may "materialize a spirit." It might even be Mr.
Kane, she reasoned. See how, in the letter, it is stated
conditions are favorable. That is urging quick action.
The whole letter, if analyzed, shows an amazing under
standing of human nature.
Fortunately, Mrs. Kane showed the letter to a family
friend who understood the "racket." He turned it over
to the police, who sent a policewoman dressed in black
to pose as Mrs. Kane. This policewoman obtained
enough evidence to convict the arch faker—but the
courts only gave him a short sentence (six months) on
a charge of fortune telling; there is not a sufficiently
powerful statute in the State in which Mrs. Kane lives
to send fake mediums up for the length of time they
deserve.

Tony Malano, a Sicilian by birth, was a prosperous

an honest, hardworking and God fearing man bringing
up his six "bambinos" as good American children. One
day, one of his customers, living on West 109th Street,
known to him as Mrs. Stern, seemed particularly happy.
Unlike her usual self, Mrs. Stern chatted with Tony.
There were no other customers and Tony welcomed the
opportunity to talk with a "fine American lady" about
something other than, "Yes, the bananas are fine, to

having made a lot of money on some stock "the ghosts
told him to buy."
Superstitious Tony eagerly asked for more details,
but Mrs. Stern said she didn't know them, but if Tony
was really interested, she'd ask her husband for the
whole story. Tony practically begged her, and as she
left, he presented her with a huge pineapple he said he'd
been "savin'
"
for the wife and bambinos.
Two days passed before Mrs. Stern returned. Two
anxious days for Tony because he had heard so much
of the great wealth in the stock market that he yearned
for a chance to make money faster than in selling fruits,
despite the fact in seventeen years he had scrimped and
saved until he had almost $30,000 in the Chemical
National Bank. Nervously finishing waiting on a cus
tomer, he went to her.
"Did you find out about the ghosts?" he asked. "Will
they tell me about how to make money?"
Mrs. Stern gave him a card and said that her hus
band had told her it would admit him to the presence
of a great fortune teller, whose aim was to aid others,
not himself, and that all he charged was "what the visitor
could afford." Mrs. Stern explained that her husband
had made more money that day and that Tony would be
wise to go at once to consult with the fortune teller.
The card read:
ORIENTAL SEER TELLS THE FUTURE

It is said foreign born men are most susceptible to
belief in fortune tellers and Tony proved
it,
as he lost
no time after closing his store, to go home to dress
in
his best clothing. He then took the subway to East 96th
Street from where he went to the address on East 101st
Street.
Walking up one flight, of
a
shabby apartment which
was almost tenement in appearance, Tony asked for
"Marvelo," presenting the card Mrs. Stern gave him.
He was ushered into
a
room covered with astronomical
designs and signs of the Zodiac. He was hardly seated
when Marvelo appeared.
We must here consider Marvelo's appearance.
Swarthy, neither Negroid nor gypsy
in
appearance,
dressed
in
raiment of most gorgeous hues, out of keep
ing with the appearance of the flat, he was most im
pressive to this untutored Italian. In heavy, accented
tones, he commanded, with one hand upraised:
"Speak not, for
I
will tell you what you want to know.
Marvel not that
I,
who know all things, know your
name
is
Antonio Malano, that you were born
in
Palermo,
that you are
in
the fruit business, that you prosper now,
but would gain more wealth.
"My fee
is
what you can afford. Cross my palm with
money and
I
will unravel the tangled skeins of your fu
ture. See,
I
who never saw you before, spoke of your
past and called you by name."
Most amazed
by
this startling introduction, Tony took
a
heavy chamois purse from his pocket and extracted
a
greasy bill, hardly noting its denomination. Marvelo
then continued:
«

ously

Tony later swore were empty) I will lay out your
future."
Proceeding to lay the cards out in a most mysterious
manner, he continued:
"Look, the Ace of Clubs turns up. Then the Ace of
Spades. These are the death cards of your wife and
yourself. Together you will die, as you have lived. Here
is the Queen of Hearts, the love card. Note, it balances
over you both. This Six of Hearts that follows shows you
have six children. Look, the Ace of Hearts follows —
that means another child will be with your wife within
a year.
"This Ten of Diamonds shows your present wealth.
If the Ace of Diamonds follows : more and more money
will be yours. Look ! Sure enough, here it is ! Money
and lots of it will be yours if you follow the directions
of these cards and me."
Going through the entire deck, telling Tony facts of
his past life as card after card turned up, Marvelo held
Tony intense and spellbound. Finally, as the deck was
exhausted, he extended his hand and asked for Tony's
right hand to be placed upward on the table so the palm
was exposed.
Taking a mysterious looking pointer, he read that
Tony had "crossed the ocean, expected to make another
trip, that he was hardworking, that he was even tem
pered, although prone to anger if excited," together with
the startling information that "there is a presence here
tonight, an unseen presence that prevents me going on.
Return at this hour tomorrow, and I will tell you how to
make money, much money."
At his store the next day, Tony was so nervous and
excited that he could do little work. Mrs. Stern did not

appear, so Tony had no one in whom to confide. Night
came and found Tony at Marvelo's apartment at the
appointed time.
The charts on the walls were covered with heavy
black materials and Marvelo was also dressed in a black
effect with a cowl, something like the monks of old wore.
Tony was told to sit on one side of the room, on one of
two chairs placed against the far wall. Marvelo sat
next to him.
"Here," said Marvelo, handing Tony a long rope,
"I want you to tie me to this chair. Then, tie my hands.
Now, make sure that I can not escape or move. You
are satisfied? Good. Move your chair two feet from me,
and directly in front of me. Place it thus. That's right.
"Mr. Malano, I intend to ask the spirits to talk to
me tonight, tell me how you make money, and lots of it.
But first the fee, is Five Dollars. Lay it at my feet. On
it,
place that bell which later spirits will ring. That's
right, that bell over there by the light switch. As soon
as you place the bell on the bill, take that long pole and
press the button that turns out the lights."
Tony did as he was told, but, as he told his wife later
that night, he was so frightened he hardly knew what
he was doing. Pushing off the lights, he sat squarely fac
ing Marvelo, whose face could hardly be seen
in
the dim
light coming
in
from the street.
After
a
few moments of silence he heard Marvelo
in
voking the aid of his "spirit control." Then, while the
"conversation" continued he heard the bell he had placed
at Marvelo's feet, beginning to ring. At first gently, then
louder and louder. He could hardly remain on his chair.
As the bell reached its loudest pitch,
a
ghostly form arose
from behind Marvelo's chair, groaning and wailing with

the weirdest kind of of vibration, which shook the room.
Tony was too paralyzed to move. The blood froze in his
veins. Stark, cold fear made the hair raise on his head.
The ghostly form swayed to and fro, and as suddenly
as it appeared, it vanished. Again, Marvelo's voice broke
his thoughts:
"I thank you, great spirit who has aided me. I will
reveal to this earthbound that which you tell. Again
ring the bell for me, and as you finish, toss it in the air,
light the lights which the mortal put out to welcome your
coming, and vanish."
Marvelo had hardly stopped speaking when the bell
began to ring again, as though swinging faster and faster
in the air. It stopped ringing suddenly, and Tony felt,
rather than heard it tossed in the air. As it landed on the
other side of the room, and hadn't even begun to stop
rolling, the lights flashed on, revealing Marvelo still
bound to the chair, exactly as Tony had left him.
This "evidence" of the "spook's" visit assured Tony
of Marvelo's familiarity with the spirits, as well as leav
ing him unstrung. Marvelo bade Tony unfasten the
knots and "free his earthly body," explaining as Tony
did, that "ropes could hold his flesh but not his spirit
which wandered about communing with those in the
other world."
Marvelo told Tony that the spirits had told him that
there was a fortune to be made quickly in a copper stock
and that the spirit had given the name of the broker
from whom it could be bought. Tony begged for the
name and address which Marvelo hesitantly gave him.
The following day found Tony at the Chemical
National Bank attempting to withdraw $15,000 in bills.
Due to the bank policy of wanting to know why a client

in Tony's position would want to draw half his capital,
the paying teller turned him over to an officer of the
bank to whom Tony related his story.
The bank official communicated with the district at
torney's office, who sent an officer with Tony to the
broker. Sensing trouble, the broker stated that he had
never heard of the stock to which Tony referred. Leav
ing the brokers, the officer and Tony went to the East
104th Street Police Station for a detective. From there,
they went to Marvelo's apartment.
Marvelo was surprised as he was about to leave the
apartment and arrested as a fortune teller. He was fined
$100.00 and given six months on the "Island" on that
charge, despite his protest in Magistrate Joanah's court
that he had never heard of the stock, nor had he ever
seen Tony before. An attempt was made to arrest Mrs.
Stern either as an accomplice or a material witness, but
she was not to be found.
The State's Attorney General, under the Martin Act
in New York, can investigate brokers, and immediately
went after the broker to whom Marvelo had sent Tony,
when the case was reported to him. No evidence was
unearthed which permitted his conviction in connection
with Marvelo, but enough facts were found to arrest him
on a charge of selling spurious stocks. This case is now
pending.
* * * *
The method used to "hook" Tony was simple. To
start with, Mrs. Stern was an accomplice of Marvelo.
When the police tried to trace her, they found that she
had told the same story that she had told to Tony to
many small storekeepers in the neighborhood. All denied
having "fallen" for her talk, but I have my doubts.

Those whom fortune tellers "trim" never confess. If
they did, police would have an easier time making arrests
and getting convictions.
The card Mrs. Stern gave Tony was marked in some
way that Tony didn't see. Prior to his visit to Marvelo's,
she had gotten all the information possible about him,
his wife and children and given it to the fortune teller.
Thus, when the victim arrived, Marvelo knew from the
mark on the card who he was.
He arranged the cards in much the same way as a card
sharper "stacks" a "cold deck." The shuffle and false
cut of gamblers are a common knowledge and it was
easy for Marvelo to bring the aces and other cards out
exactly as he wanted them. The story he told as the lesser
important cards came out was one that he made up as
he went along.
When Marvelo read Tony's palm, he told him noth
ing Tony didn't know, and even if he hadn't had previous
information, he still could have said the things he did.
Fortune tellers use applied psychology without even
knowing it.
Note that Marvelo told Tony he'd "crossed the
ocean." Of course he had, else how could he have come
from Italy? "Expected to take another trip." Where is
the "soul so dead" who doesn't want to see his native
land again? His hands showed he was hardworking.
They were bound to be calloused from opening crates
of fruit or cutting bananas. "Even tempered?" Cer
tainly, a retail man must be even tempered or he'd lose
his trade. "Prone to anger if excited." Not alone is this
a national trait of the Italian, but most of us lose our
tempers when very excited.
Almost all fortune tellers and palm readers work this

way. Take a few self-evident facts, weave a story about
them, make the listener believe it is uncanny or super
natural and we have a possible start to a tragedy. Palm
ists are good judges of human natures, find out a few
facts from a victim along deduction lines, and then begin
to ask a few disguised questions, the "answers" to which,
a little later, can be used.
When the time came for Marvelo to "produce the
ghost," he simply stole a simple trick or two from
mediums. The rope that Tony tied was an ordinary
clothes line, but had been selected because it slid easily.
After Tony put out the lights, Marvelo released one
hand and picked up the bell. In the darkness, of course,
Tony could not see that.
The appearance of the "ghost" was equally simple.
Lying on the floor behind the black curtains covering
the wall, was a piece of white gauze chemically treated
with luminous paint. Marvelo had a pulley arrangement
whereby with his one free hand he could pick up the
thread controlling it. Pulling- on the thread raised the
gauze up. Against the white gauze, the black curtain
made a great contrast. When Marvelo dropped the
thread, the gauze naturally fell to the floor. Marvelo
then pulled the black curtain over the small bunch of
material on the floor and the ghost had vanished.
He then picked up the bell again, swung it a few times,
as a signal to a concealed assistant (it might have been
Mrs. Stern) that the seance was over, put his hand back
in the loop from which he released
it,
and the helper put
on the lights from another switch
in
an adjoining room.

1922, at the suggestion of members of the Society of
American Magicians, when a war on crooked mediums
was under way, complete data was given on how they
could detect fraudulent mediums in the presence of
alleged communications from the dead. This book, to
gether with "The Life of the Mysterious Dr. Q" are
known as text books among magicians, but neither book
may be obtained through regular book store channels.
Words used by mediums are always awe inspiring.
Note that Marvelo talks of "earthbound" when refer
ring to Tony. That expression is a mysterious term used
by genuine spiritualists in referring to those still living.
These believers in the new religion do not claim, as do
fake mediums, that spirits can be materialized at a
moment's notice, nor do they, as a general thing, act as
fortune tellers.

Ann Tarbell was a pretty widow of twenty-six. She
had some money —about six thousand dollars, and was
undecided whether she should continue work as a clerk
in a Wall Street specialty shop, or marry Charlie Burns,
who said he was a cashier of a fairly large printing
corporation. While walking in the Bowling Green sec
tion of New York on her way to work one morning,
she was attracted by an odd sign—neat, dignified, which
read: "The Swamt knows all. Consultation invited."
On an impulse she went in.
A long, poorly lighted hall led to an equally dimly lit
anteroom. Ann nervously wondered what had possessed
her to come, but it was too late to back out, for a well-
dressed and dapper young man was greeting her with
a cheery "Good morning."

Ann explained that she'd like a consultation. Without
asking her name, or any questions, he requested Ann to
give him a glove, a handkerchief, or other piece of wear
ing apparel, as "the Swami gets the answers from the
touch of your personality contained in something per
sonal."
She gave him a handkerchief and he left the room.
Returning a few moments later, he stated that the Swami
would see her. He paused to warn her that "the Swami
is controlled by the Unknown and Unseen," and must
be permitted to talk without interruption after the con
sultation has started.
He led her into a chamber fitted up as an Oriental
temple, or at least what Ann thought an Oriental temple
would be.
A huge bronze brazier in one corner of the room, joss
sticks burning at the feet of the prodigious Buddha, an
oilcloth roll on which were painted the signs of the
Zodiac, a great chart of a nude form, and a picture of a
ghost made up the decorations.
In the center of the room was the table without which
no seer or fortune teller operates. There were but two
chairs in the room, and the assistant waved Ann into one
while the Swami took the other.
"Let me have your hand," he said, as he sat down.
Ann felt repelled at the touch of his fingers, for his
hand was dirty, flabby, moist, almost deathlike in its limp
ness. She was glad when he dropped her fingers after
giving them a tight squeeze.
"He that knows all will now speak," the assistant
intoned. "You say nothing." He left the room.
Alone with this soothsayer with dirty hands, shabby,
kimono-like gown and weird manner, Ann doubly re

gretted coming to see him, but as he began to talk the
fear dropped from her, for his deep monotone was sooth
ing, almost hypnotizing.
"My child," he commenced, "you come to me in doubt
about something. You are uncertain about a love affair.
You are wondering if you should marry. I receive from
this handkerchief of your certain impulses that tell me
to advise you to wed.
"You were married. You are a widow. You should
marry again, and soon.
"I see the shoulders of a man who is neither large nor
small, neither stout nor thin. He is not over thirty. You
have met him only recently, yet he sways your emotions.
Take him for your husband. Your own late husband,
from the Other World, tells me to bid you do this.
"Bring the boy to me if you still doubt. But that is up
to you. You, at least, should return for more advice. The
fee is five dollars for this reading. Longer readings are
ten dollars. No more now, come again."
As Ann hesitated, stunned by this apparent power of
the seer, the assistant came in the room as though called,
although Ann did not see the Swami make a move. He
ushered Ann from the Swami's presence, and before she
knew
it,
had collected the five-dollar fee and had escorted
her to the outer door.
Ann could hardly wait to reach
a
pay station to phone
Charlie. She was so unnerved that she tried three times
before she got the right number. Ann almost shouted
into the phone
:
"Charlie

will too, and we can meet. I want you to go to him
with me."
Ann didn't give Charlie time to think. An engage
ment was made to meet in front of the Swami's office.
Came noon. As Ann saw him come swinging down the
street, she ran to greet him. Her eyes gleamed as she
told him of her experiences.
Charlie wanted to have lunch before they went to
the Swami, but Ann emphatically stated she "just
couldn't eat" now. So they went at once to the seer's
parlors.
Ann told the assistant that they wanted a ten-dollar
reading each. Would the Swami receive them together,
telling their fortunes together? This couldn't be done,
the assistant replied. "The control only takes each mind
and body separately."
They arranged for Charlie to enter the Swami's salon
first.
When he came out, obviously amazed, Ann threw her
arms about him and kissed him.
"Did he say you should marry?" she excitedly asked.
"He sure did, honey," Charlie replied. "And better
than that he described you to a 'T.' He must be guided
by spirits or something. Now, you go in and see what
happens."
Ann was ushered back into the office. Dirty and queer
looking as the Swami was, Ann could have kissed him,
she was so happy. Her consultation was a repetition of
his earlier advice, but more elaborate. The Swami even
predicted that her first child would be a boy.
So Ann and Charlie were married the following week.

Spook Crooks!
Immediately following the wedding, they went to
Atlantic City for a week's honeymoon. All seemed won
derful until the third day, when Charlie's money ran out.
"Hadn't had time to go to the bank," he said.
Ann gave him a three-hundred-dollar draft on her sav
ings bank, and her bank book so the Atlantic City bank
could arrange the transfer of the funds. And they had a
glorious time.
Back in New York they picked out an ideal little apart
ment and furnished it on the installment plan. Things
seemed to be moving along nicely. Ann blessed the Swami
daily.
One evening after they had been married less than a
month, Charlie told Ann he didn't believe in a wife
having money in her own name. He pointed out that it
should be in their joint names, "so if either died, the
other could draw."
Ann agreed and gave Charlie her bank book to open
the joint account.
Once or twice afterwards she mentioned money mat
ters to Charlie, but he kissed her and told her "not to
worry her pretty head about money." Ann worried a
little about this, as the collectors from the installment
furniture house were calling to tell her that the last two
installments were due, but when she mentioned the visits
to Charlie, he flew in a rage and left the house.
He never returned!
Ann went to the firm where he was employed as a
"cashier" and found that Charlie had been a shipping
department clerk. She went to the bank to see about the
"joint account," and found Charlie had never opened
one, and that he'd withdrawn all her balance in cash. She
went to the office of the Swami with her story, saying

she'd never have married unless he'd advised her. The
Swami had even forgotten he'd ever talked to her. He
wasn't interested in her.
A child was to be born. Absolutely penniless, heart
broken, and unable to work now, she tried suicide by
leaping from Spuyten Duyvil Bridge. The attempt failed.
While recovering, Ann told her story to an attorney, who
brought the story to the attention of the Press Bureau
of the Parent Assembly of the Society of American
Magicians, which investigated the Swami's method of
fortune telling, and gave the result to the proper author
ities. The Swami was arrested and fined. He left town,
but probably is back in his nefarious trade in some other
city under some other name.
* * * *
How did the Swami know that Ann was a widow, that
she was in love, and that she had come to him for aid in
solving her problems? She had spoken not a word in his
presence, or in front of his attendant; she had given no
hint of her past.
Why, all the Swami had to do was rely on his wits
when Ann appeared, and he says almost all fortune
tellers' wits are exceedingly sharp.
When Ann came in her costume consisted of a dark
dress, a hat of last year's style, and new shoes. She wore
a string of beads and a wedding ring, no other jewelry.
From this, the soothsayer told her "fortune."
The wedding ring showed that she had been married.
It was a better kind than the dress or hat she wore. The
dress looked as though it was the type worn for "second
mourning." He deduced she was probably a widow in
reduced circumstances.
Her shoes were of a brand widely advertised to help

foot troubles; hence she was working at a position that
kept her on her feet, obviously something she never had
to do when her husband was alive. The beads looked
like a gift, they were so new. Naturally he figured a gift
of that type had come from a man.
She would not have come to him if she had not been
in doubt about something. What else could it be that
worried her than the question, "Should I remarry?"
Figuring and partially correct in his surmise, that the
widow did want to remarry, he told her to. Why not tell
her what she wanted to hear, he reasoned.
He had no interest in whether she did remarry or
not, all he wanted was to tell her something that would
convince her he was a marvel. It is in these ways of
making deductions and giving advice that the fortune
teller, intent on nothing but making money, is a menace
to society.
Even men carry marks of identification that give the
seer a chance to make deductions and make statements
that puzzle the smartest people.
They do not need to wear fraternal order insignia to
furnish the fortune teller with clews. Their rings, watch
chains, cut of their hair, clothes, shoes, even speech or
mannerisms are sufficient to tell him a number of obvious
things, which, when translated into his flowery and
strange words, make it all seem very impressive. And on
these reputations are built his fortune, for as his fame
spreads so do his fees go up.

CHAPTER III
BURNED MESSAGE READING
(This chapter was written by Ernest Davids, a mem
ber of the Press Bureau of the Parent Assembly of the
Society of American Magicians. It details a new method
used by fake spirit mediums to delude and defraud the
credulous. I hesitated to include it in this book for fear
some fraud, who had not yet learned of
it,
might adopt
it
to his own nefarious ends . . . The Author.)

There are always new methods and new wrinkles pre
sented during fraudulent "psychic manifestations." These
strain one's brain power to its utmost to arrive at
a
con
clusion which reveals just what material and physical
actions take place to accomplish the result presented.
And the simpler the method, the harder its detection.
Here
is
a
case which, fortunately
I
have just cleared
up for
a
banker who came to me with
a
weird story of
how
a
client was
in
danger of being defrauded.
The problem
I
had to solve was this:
A sitter
is
requested to write
a
question on
a
small
piece of paper. The medium isn't anywhere near. The
sitter
is
asked to roll the paper into
a
small pellet, drop
it
into an envelope and seal the envelope. Mind you, the
medium remains at the distance all the time.
Only after the envelope
is
securely sealed, does the
medium walk over. Then he picks up
a
pair of fire-tongs
such as you find in front of almost any fireplace and

the sitter (NOT the medium) is asked to place the
envelope into the prongs of the tongs which are then
immediately held into the fire by the medium. The en
velope, always in full sight, is thoroughly consumed by
the flames.
Yet, after a few moments, the medium is able to
"answer" the question written previously.
If you will analyze the effect of seeing a question
burned, thinking back over all the methods one knows of
getting messages which are apparently burnt, you will
never recall anything like this. As $10,000 insurance
money and a $50,000 pearl necklace were involved I
spent much time on the case.
Enough introduction. A Mrs. Edith Burrows, a recent
widow, returning from Europe recently, met a woman
calling herself Mrs. Alice Taylor, on the deck of a great
oceanic liner. They became great friends by the second
day out, for Mrs. Taylor regaled Mrs. Burrows with
stories of how a famous spirit medium in New York
brought direct messages from her late husband.
Mrs. Burrows, determined to see if she could get a
message through from her own husband, begged for the
address of the medium which Mrs. Taylor reluctantly
gave.
A day or so after the boat docked Mrs. Burrows vis
ited the mediums who were known as "The Chesters."
Here is what happened in Mrs. Burrows' own words :
"A young girl dressed in a bright colored Turkish cos
tume ushered me into a small room lighted only by two
candles. I gave my full name and at her request laid upon
the table one dollar for every letter of my name. No
further word was spoken. The money remained un
touched by the girl.

"She signalled me to follow her into a larger inner
room. I was then asked to be seated. The girl then
silently disappeared. I looked around this strange room.
The windows and walls were almost entirely covered
with thick drapery material. The floors were heavily
carpeted.
"Across one corner of the room a rod had been placed
from which was suspended more thick draperies of a
heavy velour. On the other side was a small fireplace in
which was burning a real wood fire. The lights were of
a ghostly greenish hue, filling the room with a ghastly
radiance.
"I was frightened by this silent black draped room and
wondered if I was going to ever communicate with my
husband. On the table in front of me was a large crystal,
a trumpet, a small pad and pencil. Rows of chairs occu
pied the rest of the room which I found later reserved
for public readings.
"After a moment of waiting, I felt or sensed a pres
ence in the room, when from behind the heavy draperies
appeared a woman dressed in a long pure white garment
with her face partly veiled, similar to that of a Turkish
woman. She came forward noiselessly.
" 'Mrs. Burrows?' she asked almost in a whisper, to
which I replied with a nervous
" 'Yes'.
" 'You must believe and keep silence with me while
I try to learn of you and what is in your heart.' As I
sat spellbound, the greenish lights seemed to grow more
dim until the room was almost entirely dark. She bowed
her head in silent concentration for what seemed an
endless moment.

you have just returned from an ocean trip and are try

"I started—how did she know these things, that were
so true ? I wanted to speak but dared not, since she had
asked for silence. She went on.
" 'Fate has sent you to us so that we may help you
communicate with your beloved one and help get his
messages through to you. The future has much in store
for you. We have the power and desire to help you in
many ways. Do you believe? You may now speak.'
" 'Yes, oh yes, I believe. When can I speak with my
husband and what must I do? I will give anything, only
help me to hear his voice.' She answered me in a changed
voice, as she seemed to awaken her conscious mind.
" 'My dear, this is enough for one day; we must not
tire you.
" 'Come again to me when you are rested, and the
spirits prevail more clearly. Then we will answer any
questions that may trouble you and will try to advise
you further. Rest assured you will be successful in any
earthly undertaking if you will allow yourself to be
guided by the spirit of your departed husband. Thank
you!'
"And she disappeared.
"As I rose, the girl from the outer room entered and
showed me the way out.
"'Madame wishes another appointment?' she asked.
'We have Monday and Friday evenings open for public
meetings, and any afternoon or evening, except Wednes
day, for private interviews.'
"I agreed to come the following Tuesday.

"Once home, I immediately phoned Mrs. Taylor, who
agreed to go with me when I kept the appointment, so
on Tuesday night, at the appointed time, we went to
gether.
"As we entered, Mrs. Taylor placed $10.00 on the
table and I did the same, not knowing just what the fee
might be for second readings. The girl took our names
as though we were strangers and made us wait for a
moment before taking us into the inner rooms.
"This time there were about six other people in the
room, already seated. A victrola was playing softly. This
group was evidently complete, for as soon as we were
seated, the Master Chester entered in a long white robe
and flowing turban. Madame Chester did not appear
with him. As the victrola continued to play soft music,
the medium announced that he was very happy to see us.
Also that an examination could be made of the spirit
cabinet by all present, before the seance would begin.
"I followed Mrs. Taylor as she led the way. She ex
plained to me that the cabinet was empty and would be
occupied by the spirits later on.
"We returned to our seats. Each of us then received
a slip of paper on which we were asked to write a ques
tion, and to fold the slip as many times as possible. Next,
we were told to place the tiny folded slip in an envelope.
The envelope was sealed by us.
"The lights seemed to flicker out and there was no
light except that of the fireplace.
"Chester rose from his chair hardly visible in the dim
light and gave some psychic readings, thrilling people
in the audience by his translation of their secret hopes
and dreams.

"After the readings were over, one by one our sealed
questions were taken up by Chester, in a queer looking
pair of fireplace tongs. These were burned before our
eyes in the fireplace!

were told the seance would continue. Mrs. Taylor whis

"I focused my eyes upon the cabinet. What was com

Suddenly a voice came from the cabinet. I placed the
trumpet to my ear. The voice grew louder. My heart
was racing. The voice was like that of a drunken person,
as it became more clear. Finally it almost shrieked:
" 'Edith, where are you?'
"Was this for me or was there another Edith in the

so long to talk to you. Though I seem far away my

"Then the voice seemed to fall into nothingness. I
felt like crying aloud: 'Let me see you.' But the words
seemed to choke in my throat as I dropped the trumpet.

of the seance, while others present received messages
from their loved ones and answers to their questions
which has been burned to ashes before our very eyes.
"I knew now that spirits did exist though I had seen
none.
"Suddenly a movement of the curtains near the spirit
cabinet. Something white and luminous appeared. Then
a ghostlike form stood revealed before us out of no
where. It seemed to be the figure of a woman clad in
masses of white gauze. It stayed only a moment.
"Before I had time to realize that I had seen this
spirit from the dark shadows of Eternity, it had glided
back beyond the curtains, and was gone.
"Next, a silver star seemed to float over our heads,
and disappeared. My nerves were tense as I gripped the
back of the chair in front of me.
"The lights were turned on. The seance was over.
"Chester seemed slightly dazed, but quite anxious to
know the effects and results of the seance.
"My eyes were cast downward as they became accus

sheet of paper. What was this and where had it come
from? I opened it. A note! The handwriting was scrawly
—the signature Harry's ! I turned to Mrs. Taylor dumb

" 'Did you receive a message through the hand of the
medium ?' she asked quietly.
"Lacking the power of speech I nodded and handed
the message to her as she read slowly:
"
'Buy E. C. E. Company stock with your $10,000 insurance
money. Bring your pearls to Chester also. He'll tell you what to
do with them. I will come to you again.

"Surely, this was the will of Heaven itself, my racing
brain thought. This then was the right thing to do, to
have come here. Tomorrow I would get the money and
bring it to these mediums for safe investment and divi
dends.
"The group disbanded and as they went out I ap
proached the medium timidly. I said I'd bring my pearls
as well as the $10,000 to him, so he could buy E. C. E.
stock for me. He seemed to be astonished. He said he
knew nothing of such a stock.
"I then showed him the note which he said he'd never
seen before. He explained he'd go into a private trance
to see what Harry had in mind. He further stated he
had Mrs. Taylor's husband in spirit land as a 'control'
and that he had done much good for her.
"Mrs. Taylor confirmed his statements and I was cer
tainly thrilled with the prospect of making money
through Harry's advice.
"Alice and I then left. I went to the Wickstrom Bank
and Trust Company the next day to withdraw the
$10,000 in cash with which I was to purchase this stock
that had been recommended by my departed husband.
"With my mind so filled with the workings of the
spirit medium, it did not occur to me that Harry would
never wish me to place all my principal in one company.
And if it had, Mrs. Taylor had advised me that spirits
were always correct in their guidance, so I'd have pushed
my caution in the background anyway. No more worry
as to finance, my brain was singing.
"I then went to get my necklace from the safe deposit
vault, but when I was opening the steel door, a bank
official came to me and I told him my story."

Mrs. Burrows came to me in company with Mr. Cra
mer, President of the Wickstrom Bank and Trust Com
pany. I know Mr. Cramer well and he is acquainted
with my interest in spiritual matters where fraud is in
volved. He made sure that Mrs. Burrows would visit me
by bringing her himself.
To make a long story short, I persuaded Mrs. Bur
rows to give up any idea of investing in the E. C. E.
Company, at least until I had investigated the case. Be
lieve me, when I say persuaded, I mean it. It certainly
did take persuasion on my part and her attitude was
nothing short of belligerent. Poor woman.
Through her, I made an appointment with the me
diums, Mr. and Mrs. Chester, but it was not until my
third sitting with him that he employed the same method
with me that he used with Mrs. Burrows.
I was stumped. I did not dare go back for another
seance until I had figured out the method used, for fear
Chester would become suspicious and deprive me of all
further opportunity to "nail" him. I enacted the scene
over and over again in my own rooms until my eyes were
opened to his method.
The clue was a sudden recollection of Chester's clumsi
ness in replacing the firetongs into their holder. This
gave me the solution. In order to be certain, I questioned
Mrs. Burrows on that very point a number of times.
The average person is most unobserving. Especially
a person at a seance in a darkened room for the first
time. At any rate, after enacting the scene with Mrs.
Burrows a number of times she, too, remembered that
Chester dropped the firetongs from his hands during the
seance, Also AFTER shaking out the ashes and BE
FORE replacing the tongs into the holder.

That little circumstance cleared the case and without
further ado Chester was arrested and put behind the
bars on a charge of "attempt to defraud." Here is what
he did. How simple, and by its simplicity, how clever.
Mrs. Burrows, after writing her question, was asked
to roll up the slip into a pellet and drop it into an en
velope. Everything legitimate so far.
Chester then placed the envelope into the prongs of
the tongs and while doing
it,
slightly pressed the edges
of the envelope so that the pellet slid into the lower
corner. This same lower corner then was placed between
the grippers of the tongs and the envelope was then
consumed by the flame,
in
full sight of the audience.
However, by pressing the prongs of the firetongs
tightly together, the flames could not consume the corner
held between the grippers, thus leaving the envelope
corner with the pellet intact! (See diagram on page 80.)
After shaking off the ashes, Chester, in the act of re
placing the tongs into the holder, feigned clumsiness and
dropped the tongs on the floor, thus giving him the op
portunity to bend down and pick up the pellet which was
later read in comfort by the aid of
a
small concealed
flashlight, while sitting at the table immediately across
from Mrs. Burrows.
Simple? Very. But see
it
done. Its very simplicity
makes this method
a
masterpiece
in
the hands of people
like this medium, who, by the way,
is
quite safe now
for
a
number of years to come.
Incidentally, Chester
is
in
good company for the E.
C. E. Company's stock salesman, who just "happened"
to call on Mrs. Burrows

with him.
Too bad we couldn't lay our hands on Mrs. Taylor.
She disappeared without
a
trace. Evidently she was pre

pared to get away on short notice. Possibly she is again
on the high seas, looking for other victims and sending
them to other mediums of her circle.
AUTHOR'S NOTE
Mr. Davids modestly forgets to point out that he
saved the $50,000 pearl necklace and the $10,000 cash
for the young widow. He also forgets to explain the flash
ing light that created the impression of visitors from
the "Other World."
Inasmuch as in many "spirit seances" flashing lights
are used they are quite common "phenomena." This is
a good place to explain them. Refer to Chapter XIV
and see how they fooled Mr. Boss.
The medium uses a "reaching rod." A reaching rod
is a contraption that collapses within itself. It may be
only a few inches when folded, but when extended may
be ten feet in length.
On the end of some reaching rods is a pincers device
that will permit the picking up of spirit trumpets and
the moving of them about. On others there is simply a
catch at the top. In both cases referred to in this book,
apparently the "catch-on-top" type was used. (See illus
tration on page 8 1.)
The reaching rod may be made of steel, much like a
steel fishing rod, but the more approved types are made
of fibre. The fibre rods are more flexible than metal ones
and more noiseless. However, when they are to be used
for picking up trumpets, or heavier articles such as tam
bourines, a medium may prefer a metal one.
The medium carries pieces of cardboard on which

have been painted stars, crosses, signs and weird designs.
These cardboards have been first painted with ordinary
black paint on both sides. When the black paint has
dried, the crosses, stars, etc., are painted on with lumi
nous paint. They are then exposed to daylight so the
luminous paint absorbs the light and when shown in a
dark room will reflect the painted designs.
WHEN FIRE DOESN'T CONSUME!
Envelope containing questions is held in fire tongs in the center of the
flames. To the credulous everything seemingly is consumed. Note close-up
of envelope in fire tongs. The part of the envelope holding the question
is protected by the tongs —it cannot burn. The medium later recovers
the question in the ashes and reads it. By such simple deceits do "Spook
Crooks" defraud believers.
Luminous paint is desired rather than radium paint,
for the former fades after a while and gives a greater
effect of a ghostly visitor.
In use, the medium takes the reaching rod from some
concealed pocket in his clothing, and the luminous painted

cardboard from, say his inner vest pocket, hooks or
clasps the card to the top of the rod, always keeping
the black side to the "sitters" and then, while dangling
the card high in the air, turns it about, so one instant
it is seen, and the next instant has vanished.
By constantly turning the rod, the "lights" flash on
and off for, of course, the black side is invisible at all
times.
The "ghost" of the Chesters was made on a flexible
steel form that was controlled from the rear of the room.
(Note the illustration on page 81.)
The wire frame was covered with black cloth and the
medium's good friend, luminous paint, again played its
part. The frame was dressed with black cloth and the
form of a woman painted on the front of it.
There was a trolley arrangement built into the ceiling
of the room, unseen in the darkness. It had a pulley
attachment so that it could be operated from the rear
of the room. When the attention of the sitters was con
centrated on the medium, his wife slipped in a rear door
with the ghost. She hooked the figure on the trolley and
pulled it to the front of the room, the way a housewife
puts out her wash on an aerial clothes line.
The medium's wife was careful to hang the figure so
that the back of
it,
which was black, was toward her.
Thus, when she pulled the ghost to the front of the
room, the sitters did not see
it,
until the figure turned
around at the end of the trolley and started its journey
back. Then the luminous front was exposed, and the
audience saw
it
for the first time
in
amazement.
The medium's assistant, garbed
in
black and wearing
a
black hood and black gloves, unhooked the figure
quickly, and left the room, taking the form with her.

CHAPTER IV
SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHY
Mr. X was made junior Senator from his State in 1894,
and by now he had been in Washington so long as to be
almost one of the sights of the city to be shown off, like
the Washington Monument, to visiting rustics.
Late in life, Senator X married a young woman from
his district. After two years of happy marriage, Mrs. X
died in giving birth to a daughter, Fayette. Senator X
was left alone with the child of his old age. He concen
trated on her all the love that was in him ; during his hard
years of struggle, he had had to bottle up all kindly feel
ings, in order to trample his way ahead in politics; now
he poured out many years' store of affection on Fayette.
He surrounded her with every luxury which his growing
wealth would permit. He sent her to the most exclusive
schools.
The old war-horse of the Senate and his daughter
were inseparable in private; the summer before Fayette
was to enter Vassar, she traveled with the Senator as he
campaigned through his district. After Labor Day they
were to part for the first time. Fayette was setting off
for college, to round off her eighteen years of brilliant
promise, and enter upon a lifetime of fulfillment; the
Senator looked forward to her as the prop of his de
clining years; indeed, he could have wished for no one
more suited to the task.
Some of her friends gave Fayette a farewell lunch at
a prominent hotel. When she returned home to go on
with her packing, she began to feel dizzy. By supper

time she was too sick to come downstairs. The Senator
called his physician, Dr. M. who examined the girl,
looked grave, filled out a prescription, and called
in Dr. H. The Eastern states were in the midst of an
infantile paralysis epidemic of great severity. Dr. H.
looked even graver than Dr. M. ; finally the two doctors
were obliged to confess that Fayette had caught the
infantile paralysis. They hoped to be able to pull her
through, they said, but it would be foolish to raise
extravagant hopes so early.
The Senator refused to stir from his daughter's bed
side. She got no worse, and she got no better. Telegrams
came in avalanches; so did letters, flowers, gifts. Still
Senator X camped in the sick-room. Ordinarily he looked
fifty-five. After a few days of the vigil, his mouth began
to sag, his wrinkles deepened, dark circles came under
his eyes ; he began to look all of his seventy-three years.
Finally Dr. M. told him that he, Dr. M., would not be
answerable for the consequences if Senator X did not
get out for some fresh air.
So the Senator went out. Slowly he walked along Penn
sylvania Avenue, looking into shop-windows without see
ing what was there, bumping now and again into a
passerby. At Eleventh Street, N. W., his wandering
attention was caught by a gaudy strip of cloth across a
window. With forced concentration he made out the
legend painted on it :

In his old days, the Senator would have made a wry
face, and would have hurried on. Now, it did not seem to
make much difference what he did; besides, this hum-
buggery might offer some slight distraction before he
returned to the ordeal of the sick-room. Senator X
went in.
The place was a vacant store, which did not appear
to have been swept since the last tenant had gone.
Madame Marie was fat and slovenly; she seemed to
have washed last at about the time when the store was
swept. Neither she nor her establishment was prepossess
ing. But the Senator was too exhausted to care, and
somehow he became almost credulous as the clairvoyant
began, "If you please, Sir, sit down facing me at thees
table. So: I drop curtain, we are alone. Put your hands
on table —wait, first cross palm. One dollar for five min
utes, or for five dollars I tell you everything."
The Senator took out a dollar bill, then changed his
mind and gave the woman a five. "I don't believe there's
anything in this; but I'm interested in something. See
what you can tell me about it."
"Verra well. You keep quiet, I talk. I tell you."
Madame Marie picked up the Senator's left hand,
and studied the palm of it for some time. Then she began
to talk. "You not just interested —you worry. I see some
one sick : You child. She die. You wife dead. You are pow
erful man—no use now. You have danger and trouble
soon. But you have money."
For ten minutes she went on, solemnly telling Sen
ator X about himself, his establishment, his affairs. He
had often used exceedingly plain language in describing
the folly of some fellow-legislators who were accustomed
to patronize clairvoyants; now he found himself on the

verge of joining the ranks of the believers. The woman
talked on. It was all true. She must be real. She was real.
"That's all," she said. "You see I am right about
death. Come again. I know great lady who talk with
spirits. Come again. She help you."
The Senator had scarcely the strength to leave the
place; he had to call a taxi to take him home.
There was an awful silence about the house. He
tottered in haste up the stairs. The servants were stand
ing in a group by the bedroom door. Someone sobbed.
Dr. M. stood with bowed head next to the bed.
The Senator collapsed.
* * * *
The Senator was kept under the influence of opiates
for twenty-four hours, during which time the funeral
arrangements were completed. He was permitted to sit
up in bed from time to time and to read the remarkable
messages of condolences from Federal, State and City
authorities that came by the hundreds, but the doctors
kept him under constant observation.
Fayette died on a Monday and the funeral was set for
Wednesday morning. The senator drowsed under the
influence of morphine Tuesday night, but Wednesday
morning, long before day-break, he was up and about.
He seemed to be of this world, but not in it.
He looked over the scores of Kodak snapshots of his
only child, stopping at each with tears of recollections,
and passing on to the next in that half-daze that only a
combination of grief and opiate can produce. His body
lived, but his mind functioned only as it would when in a
state of catalepsy.
Let us pass over the nightmare of the funeral. Grief
begets grief, and the nation sorrowed with the bereaved

father. Even the political opponents of the senator for
got party lines and bitter battles, and came to pass last
tribute to the one bright spot in the private life of a
man whose greatest fault was his unyielding character
and lack of tact.
Wednesday night found the senator back in bed with
Dr. Monroe in attendance, but the senator no longer
needed opiates, for his rugged physical nature, despite
his years, threw off the shock much better than that of
many a younger man. Only the senator's brain seemed to
be still affected.
He told Dr. Monroe of the fortune teller's statement,
but the doctor passed it off as nothing,—"just a lucky
guess," he said. The senator was obstinate in his refusal
to listen to the medico's explanation of how fortune
tellers size up a customer, and by using applied psy
chology give random statements designed to hit home,
for he told the doctor that when he felt better he in
tended to visit the seeress again.
According to all traditions Time, the great healer,
should have softened the blow of Fayette's loss, but
while the senator's body grew stronger, the deep hurt
remained in his mind, dulling his intellect and making
him just a senile old man, rather than the sturdy warrior
of a thousand political battles. While the senate was
closed for the summer, and the new session was not yet
in sight, Senator X had nothing to think about except
Fayette and the strange prophesy of the fortune teller.
To all those braving the heat of Washington in the
summer, he told of Madame Marie's statements, and
eagerly wanted to exchange experiences with any who
had called on her, or any other type of seer. Some told

of what astrologers had predicted, others talked of mind
readers, and still more discussed spiritualism.
It all preyed on his mind to such an extent, that the
senator finally made up his mind to return to the Egyp-
tianologist as Marie termed herself. Leaving the house
shortly after the noon meal one day, he found his way to
her store. He had hardly entered when she came up to
him and held out her hand.
"My frien'," she sympathized. "I read that the girl die
like I say. That is too bad. I am glad you come to me
again. I can help you."
The senator felt strangely at ease with her, and as
he talked he watched her face, wondering subconsciously
what attracted and repelled him at the same time. Her
piercing black eyes seemed like two balls of fire set in a
ghastly face, and the coal black hair fell in unkempt
ragged wisps over her forehead. She seemed to be utterly
out of place in this world, she was so similar to what
his beliefs of what a witch of a thousand years ago
resembled.
After a few moment's talk, Madame Marie began to
paint in her quaint English a picture that more than
attracted the unhappy man.
"I know a person," she said, "who knows all. This
person, she is what you call a medium who talks with
the dead, brings them to life again, and has them send
messages to their relatives. She also can, with a camera,
take your picture and bring on it the spirit of the loved
one who is here no more.
"I will send you to her and she will help you more
than I. She is an Englishwoman from my home town of
Khedive, Egypt, and while she was there livin', she made
many demonstrations to every one that she know the

secrets of the old Egyptian priests. Even as I told you
the girl would die, my frien1 from her knowledge of the
other world, could have told you the exact minute the
Master Spirit would take your daughter to him."
Writing a name and address on a dirty piece of wrap
ping paper, Marie gave it to the senator who took it
thankfully and gratefully, at the same time slipping a
folded bill in her hand. Just as a drowning person grasps
at a straw, so did he take the name and address in the
hope that it would bring succor.
He hailed a taxi and looked at the paper. There was
written, almost printed, "Mrs. Landsdowne, 4235 Grant
Avenue." Telling the driver where he wanted to go, the
aged senator leaned back thinking over the stories he had
heard of what mediums were capable of doing, and won
dering if Mrs. Landsdowne could duplicate the mani
festations of bringing messages by getting one for him
from Fayette. He did not quite understand what Marie
had meant about the photography, but he hoped to soon
find out.
His taxi finally pulled up in front of a small, well-built
building, which his driver advised him was 4235 Grant
Avenue.
A neatly dressed colored maid admitted him, usher
ing the caller into a large living room. While waiting
Senator X inspected the decorations carefully. There was
nothing out of the ordinary in the furnishings, although
the walls were curtained heavily with black drapes,
instead of being papered or painted. The chairs were
only camp stools, and there were a great number of them
folded against the walls, only three being open and in
place about a small table.
He was reading a sign which advised :

when Mrs. Landsdowne entered. She was an extremely
prepossessing woman past 50, garbed in becoming black,
with her hair brushed back from her forehead.
She greeted the senator cordially with just that degree
of deference which acknowledged she knew he was a
personage, yet with a reserve that seemed to say, "We
are of two different worlds."
The senator explained his errand.
"I have lost an only child recently. A strange woman,
Madame Marie she calls herself, told me you might be
of help to me in seeking knowledge of her. I prefer not
to make myself known to you as yet, but if you can aid
me, you need have no fear of the future, for I will pro
vide handsomely for you."
"My dear sir," the medium replied. "I have no in
terest in you save that you are a mortal who seeks my
aid, and as to your promise to help me financially, I am
not interested, for my little congregation of believers in
communication between the spirit world and this, keeps
me alive materially.
"However, I wish you would write a message to your
departed one and seal it in this envelope. I will see if I
can get an answer."
Handing the senator a piece of paper and an envelope,
she turned about as he commenced to write. She picked
up a nearby book and commenced to read from
it,
paying
no attention to her caller.

Senator X wrote a few lines, "merely as a test" he
said, and held the envelope tightly in his right hand as
he put the pen back in his pocket with his left. His feel
ings were inexplicable, fear of failure to establish com
munication, doubt that it might be a trick, worry that if
Fayette did hear, she might not answer: there were a
thousand and one contradictory thoughts racing through
his mind.
Mrs. Landsdowne seemed to sense his mental con
dition for she started a short discourse on her beliefs.
"We are strangers," she declared. "I am a spirit
medium, duly ordained. You are a layman. I want to
bring relief to you, if I can, by establishing contact with
someone in the spirit world whom you loved while here.
You state it was a child. You need not mention age or
sex. I do not want you to.
"As you hold the envelope in your hand, in which is
sealed a piece of paper with the query written thereon
you wish answered, let me explain that science agrees
with me that there really is a method of communication
with the dead. Just where dreams leave off and reality
begins, you must answer for yourself.
"Some are playing with fire when they attempt to
pierce the veil of the Unknown, but I, for more than
thirty years a student of Egyptian theosophy, have also
imbibed the spirit of Isis, the Goddess of the Lost. When
I go into a trance and talk to my control, who is Isis
most of the time, I am in a form of self-hypnosis, my
unconscious reflexes bringing me messages from the
Other World that I could never get were I in a normal
condition.

ditions of the ages old wizards of the pre-Christian era.
If you recall the Bible states in its translated form,
'Face the devil and It will
fly
away from you.' The
correct translation, according to my beliefs
is
'Face the
Spirits and They will
fly
toward you.'
"All our forebears knew that there were certain
aspects of life that they did not know; they called these
things supernatural. You may too,
if
you will. Not know
ing how to combat them, or to bring them to their aid,
superstition came into being. Materialists disclaim super
stition, and say they have an answer to everything except
communication with the dead.
Iwill give you demonstra
tions of how spirit energy will make
a
table move, pro
duce raps and obey my commands. Science will not
explain these things.
"Now that you have learned
a
little of my creed, let
me have the pen with which you wrote your question and
also the envelope
in
which
it
is
sealed."
The senator had listened to the flow of "logic" which
he had hardly been able to follow, and was semi-con
vinced he was
in
the presence of one who really could
bring him word from Fayette. As he complied with the
medium's request, he noted that she did not even glance
at the envelope.
She laid
it
down on the table, took up the pen, and
asked
"Do not give me the year of your child's birth. Give
me, though, the date."
"March
1
2th."
"I will write that on the sealed envelope."
Suiting the action to the word the medium wrote the
birth date on the envelope Senator X had sealed, using
her knees as
a
writing table.

"With your permission, let us now move away from
each other. We will leave the envelope on the table, but
keep your mind on the question. No, we won't do that.
You pick up the envelope and hold it while I prepare to
go into a trance condition."
The senator reached for the envelope, moved to where
the medium indicated he was to sit, and waited.
As soon as the medium took her seat, she closed her
eyes, began to rub her forehead and a few seconds later
she began to sway in her seat. She then moaned and
groaned as though in agony, and as the unearthly sounds
came from her lips, Senator X sensed the unnatural. To
his religious mind, it was an ungodly thing she was try
ing to do, this speaking with the dead.
Slowly the moans grew less and less, the medium
stopped swaying and began to mutter:
"Isis, I believe in you and the spirits that are your
slaves. Before me is a mortal who seeks solace at your
feet. Please, most gracious and most beautiful, place in
my mouth words you would speak.
"The pet name that this mortal called his little girl
who has just joined us in this side of the void is
'general.'
"
The senator started to rise, put his hand to his heart
and sank back in his chair for the question that he had
written was:
"What pet name did I call Fayette?"
and he felt that no one outside of his immediate house
hold knew this, for after the great French general
La Fayette, he had nicknamed his girl 'general.'
The medium appeared to take no note of what had
happened for she continued :
"The little girl was just past 18. She loved her father

and welcomes being able to come to him in Spirit. Just
as she told me her father's pet name for her, in answer
to the question, she sends word that she is happy and
content in spirit and wants her father to come regularly
to talk with her through me."
The medium's muscles seemed to jump and contract.
She stopped talking. She groaned, moved her head as
though it were dislocated, opened her eyes and asked:
"Did I get a message through for you? While under
control I do not understand what my lips say, for you
must realize that the words you hear, come direct from
Spirits, I serving only as a medium through which they
can talk."
Senator X did not answer her for a moment. His eyes
never left hers, for a few moments the analytical brain
that was the pride of his home state was functioning,
attempting to fathom the possibility of communication,
and the possible trickery of the medium, but love of
Fayette, his age, and his actual desire to be convinced,
overcame the desire to materially figure out what really
happened.
"Mrs. Landsdowne," he said slowly. "I have heard of
wonderful things that mediums have done, of the solace
and comfort their actions and words have brought
others, but I have always scoffed. I do not say that I
am entirely convinced that communication with spirits is
possible at all times, but I do believe, and feel, that what
I have just heard is a perfect demonstration of the
possibilities of* spirit intercourse."
"Yes," replied the medium. "But, what happened?"
Reaching for the envelope which he had replaced on
the table, the senator carefully examined
it,
saw the flap
was still sealed, held
it

look through
it,
was satisfied that
it
was impossible for
any eye to penetrate the paper, tore open the end, took
out what he had written and silently handed the question
to the medium.
"The answer to this question was one
I
do not believe
ten people
in
this world know. Through your lips
I
re
ceived the correct answer.
I
am too shocked to stay
longer today.
Iwill return again. Permit me to leave."
Practically winded from the strain and excitement, the
senator rose. He extracted his card and handed
it
to
Mrs. Landsdowne.
"I am Senator X. From now on
I
am at your service.
What do
I
owe you for this demonstration?"
Mrs. Landsdowne bowed, took the card, but refused
any money.
"I am glad to have been of service to you, senator,"
she stated
in
a
most convincing tone. "I did not know
who or what you were when you came.
Idid not care.
I
just wanted to be of service. If you wish, later on, you
may become
a
patron of this little group which believes
in
me, but today there
is
no fee."
Thanking the medium, the senator made his adieu and
went down to the taxi which had been waiting. All the
way home, the senator kept thinking of Fayette and the
message, until his tired brain refused to function longer
on the subject.

For two weeks after Senator X had his experience with
the medium, he read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sir Oliver
Lodge and Hereward Carrington on the question of
Spiritualism. He wanted to believe communication was
possible, but some unknown restraint always seemed to
hold him. He argued with himself, mentally quoting

something from Doyle one minute and something from
Lodge the next. Then he read his Bible and there found
that "it is not well to hold converse with the spirits."
His mind was constantly in a turmoil. He studied
the moves that Mrs. Landsdowne had made with the
envelope, trying to convince himself that it was a trick,
and at the same time to prove that Fayette really came in
answer to the medium's call. He was in a dilemma that
he felt could only be answered by visiting her again.
Accordingly he phoned her, and made an engagement
for that afternoon. Arriving at her house, he was amazed
to see two cameras in the living room and Cooper Hewitt
lights strung over the ceiling, until he recalled that Marie
had mentioned something about photography to him.
Mrs. Landsdowne chattered aimlessly for a while and
finally broached the subject of spirit photography, a sub
ject that Sir Arthur had gone into most thoroughly and
deeply.
According to the great English author, creator of
Sherlock Holmes, spirit photography was the most genu
ine means of proving communications with the dead. He
exhibited thousands of photographs in which strange and
ghostly heads appeared in a manner that he stated was
supernatural, but he did say many examples of it were
"faked."
Mrs. Landsdowne invited the senator to pose for a
photograph expressing the hope that "perhaps Fayette
would appear in the finished print." He was anxious to
try
it,
but also reluctant. Words can not explain the cross
purposes at which his mind was working.
However, he hopefully waited the next step. The
medium stated that because of the many frauds that had
been perpetrated
in
the name of spirit photography,

(here she quoted Doyle at length) she preferred not to
take the picture until the senator himself had purchased
the photographic plates needed. She said that there was
an Eastman supply house nearby and she would walk
there with him while he purchased them.
The senator did not feel much like walking but agreed,
as he was anxious to have the test picture taken. It was
only a five minutes walk, but it tired him, so when they
approached the clerk, it was in a very weak voice that he
ordered what he had been told :
"Two boxes of Speed 5x7 plates, please."
Mrs. Landsdowne interrupted and asked the clerk to
please take half a dozen boxes from the shelf and let
someone select two boxes from the lot, for she ex
plained :
"We are doing some special photgraphy and I want to
be sure the plates are freely selected."
A customer, waiting to be served, selected two boxes
from those the clerk took from the shelf, astonished to
be requested to do so, but obliging because he recognized
the senator. These two boxes the medium handed to the
senator and asked him to examine the seals. Satisfied that
the plates were as packed at the Eastman factory, he
wrote his name across the seals in obedience to the
medium's request. He was now certain the plates were
fresh and untampered with.
Arriving back at her home, Mrs. Landsdowne took
the senator to a small room fitted up as a darkroom.
Here she explained that she didn't want him to let the
plate out of his hands. She told him to select one box,
cut the seals, and then she would put out the white light
and turn on the red which is a safe light for loading
plates or developing them.

Taking up a knife the senator cut the seals, and the
medium switched on a "Wratten and Wrainwright Safe-
lamp," the standard developing light. As the weak red
glow permeated the darkroom, Mrs. Landsdowne told
the senator to take one of the glass plates out of the box
and to insert it in the plate holder that she held. He did
so and the medium replaced the dark slide that would
not be drawn again until the plate holder was in the
camera.
She then took up another plate holder of different
make, "for the other camera," she explained, and asked
the senator to load that holder also. He did as bid and
was certain that the plates had not been tampered with
and that everything so far was absolutely honest and
above board. (Note: It actually was.)
Telling the senator to cover up the unexposed plate so
that she could turn on the white light again, she handed
him both of the loaded plateholders, after he had re
placed the black paper wrapping as instructed. They then
went to the living room where the two cameras were
standing in the same position they had been in when the
senator arrived earlier in the day.
"I want you to sit almost motionless in this chair,"
the medium said, "while I focus the camera on you. I do
not guarantee that I will be able to produce the results
you want today, but we at least can try. Please fix your
mind on your daughter and have thoughts of no one else.
When I am ready to take the picture, I will take one of
the plateholders, which contains the unexposed plates,
from you and place it in the camera."
As the senator took his seat, the medium turned on the
Cooper Hewitt lights. In the soft green glow of the flick
ering tubes the entire room took on a ghastly hue, en

hanced by the thoughts of the sitter. After focusing the
camera carefully, the medium closed the shutter, and
advanced to the senator.
Taking one of the plate holders from him, and telling
him to place the other on the floor beside him, she walked
back to the camera and inserted the plate holder in the
proper place, always keeping it in view so the senator
could see that no substitution was made.
She then withdrew the slide so that when she pressed
the shutter release the plate would be exposed. Taking
hold of the bulb she walked closer to the senator whose
face was a study of hope and doubt.
"As I press this bulb," she said, "I want you to have
no mind for anything except Fayette. I will silently pray
to Isis that she will send the spirit of your child to this
room so that she will appear in the picture with you. I
hope and pray, but promise nothing."
The senator sat rigid. His thoughts were only on his
child. The medium's face in the colored light took on a
look almost spiritual in its ecstasy, and her eyes looked
squarely at the subject she was about to photograph. She
raised her hand with the bulb visible :
"Steady now," she ordered.
Click. The shutter opened and closed. The picture was
taken !
"Let us hurry now to develop it," the senator asked.
"No," the medium explained, "spirit pictures must be
taken in twain, two at one sitting. The next picture will
be one of nothing but that black curtain. It may be that
we can get a picture of Fayette alone against that dark
background. Anyway, we can try."
The senator could hardly believe his ears.
"You mean," he queried, "that you will take a picture

of that curtain and we will see Fayette's picture in the
result?"
Moving the camera away from the position where it
had been, the medium took up another type, a 5 x 7 Press
Graflex with a huge F/4.5 Bausch and Lomb Zeiss
Tessar lens. The first camera used had been a Century
View Camera of the same size but with an ordinary por
traiture lens.
She placed the Graflex on the table and moved both
camera and table toward the curtain. When she was
about five feet away from the curtain, she asked the sen
ator to give her the Graflex plate holder. This she imme
diately inserted in the rear, explaining as she did so that
she would focus from the reflecting hood, rather than
through a ground glass in the back as one must with a
view camera, such as she had first used.
Satisfied the camera was in focus, the medium in
structed the senator to walk over by the curtain. When
he reached there, she asked him to please flash the switch
which controlled the Cooper Hewitt lights, on and off, as
she instructed him. She then opened the shutter and
began her orders :
"On. Off. On. Off. On. . . . Off. O.K."
Snapping down the mirror of the camera instead of
dropping the focal plane shutter to cut off the light
coming through the lens, the medium drew a deep sigh
of relief.
"I've made the pictures. Let us now see what has
happened."
Returning to the darkroom, with the senator carrying
the two plate holders, all was ready for the development.
The medium switched off the white and turned on the red

light and walked to a table near the developing trays
which reposed over a deep sink.
"Place the plate holders on the table and watch that
these which we develop are the very plates you loaded.
As a matter of precaution please write your name on this
plate, which is the one we first exposed of you alone."
Picking up the plate the medium passed it to the sen
ator who wrote his name across the bottom of it. Cross
ing to the developing trays, the medium asked him to
immerse it in the pyro-metol solution, a standard and
widely used developing fluid, as it cuts down the high
lights and brings up the detail of the shadows almost at
the same time.
Immersing the plate in the solution, he rocked the tray
back and forth for a few seconds as directed by the
medium, "so that the developer flows over all parts of
the plate at the same time."
The medium then brought another plate to the de
veloper and asked the senator to develop that one, also,
"to see if Fayette really appeared on the black curtain."
Inserting the second plate in the same large tray, it was
a professional n x 14 developing dish, the senator
rocked the tray again and again.
Slowly, but surely, an image appeared on the first plate
they were developing. First came the senator's forehead,
for the highlights develop shortly before the shadows,
then gradually the features began to fill it. Just as the
shadows began to show, high above the senator's head on
the undeveloped plate another face began to appear!
Slowly it began to build up until actual features were
visible ! Senator X, unaccustomed to the view of a devel
oping plate, could not distinguish the figure above his

own head which, by this time, was clearly visible, but he
heard the medium gasp :
"It's a girl's head ! Fayette has come to us."
The senator staggered, gripped the end of the sink for
support and earnestly asked:
"Are you sure? Can it be possible. How soon can I
see?"
"Shortly," he was told. "We must 'fix' the plate by
putting it in hypo so the image will be permanent. Look,
there IS something on the other plate. It's a figure of the
girl again. She IS with you !"
The senator trembled and could not realize that his
child was again with him in spirit, while the medium con
stantly kept up a running fire of conversation about the
sure return of the dead to those they loved in this world.
He was convinced. Spiritualism is proven. He felt like a
conqueror of the Unknown. He was content for the first
time in weeks, his child had returned to him in spirit after
death had taken the flesh in which the soul was encased.
By this time the medium had rinsed off the developing
fluid in pure running water and placed both plates in the
hypo bath for fixation. It was safe to turn on the white
lights now, for the hypo stops development, and she did.
Leaning over the still slightly unfixed plates, the senator
saw the images of his child. On the plate with him was a
picture of Fayette's head with the sweetest smile possible.
On the other plate, the one photographed against the
curtain, Fayette was garbed in flowing white and above
her head was a halo !
Leaving the darkroom after the medium placed the
plates in running water so the hypo could be washed from
them, they returned to the living room.
"Are you now sure that spirits do return ?" the medium

asked in low tones. "Are you convinced that spiritualism
is the religion that needs modern apostles to spread its
gospel to every corner of the earth?"
At that moment the senator would have agreed to any
thing. Hadn't Fayette returned to him? Hadn't he per
sonally seen that there was no trickery so that the pic
tures were truly taken? How could any one not in the
spirit world have impressed those images on his photo
graph ? Conan Doyle was right !
"Mrs. Landsdowne," the senator stated, "I am not
without influence and I have plenty of money to do me
for the few years left to me before I join Fayette in the
spirit world. I want to help you now financially, as well as
any other way you wish."
The medium hesitated before replying.
"Very well, senator. I will accept your aid. One thing I
need badly is a larger home, or a hall, in which I can lec
ture to more people on the possibilities of my religion.
We need about $40,000 before we break ground. Of that
I have $30,000 pledged. How much can I count on you
for the rest?"
"Why, the whole ten thousand, Mrs. Landsdowne. I
will be glad to give you my check whenever you wish it
for that amount, and as you get further along with the
building, call on me for more. I really want to meet
others of your followers and I shall spread the word of
this miracle of Fayette's pictures all over Washington."
The medium casually thanked him, as though the ten
thousand dollar pledge meant nothing to her. She then
told him that she wanted to dry the plates now, and that
if he would call again that night, when the "public dem
onstrations take place," she would give him actual photo
graphic prints from which he could make enlargements

for framing in his home. At the same time, she suggested
he might bring his check.
* * * *
The senator returned to the medium's home that eve
ning and was greeted by the medium who, instead of
being dressed in the severe black clothes she had always
worn, had donned the white flowing robes which have
been used by mediums for almost half a century. She in
troduced him to a room full of people and then gave
him a seat down near the front of the room in which a
small altar-like platform had been erected and which
she mounted after leaving her new follower.
"Let us open the evening's services with "Nearer my
God to Thee" she said, and after we sing that favorite
hymn of the late President McKinley, we will proceed
to a new materialization service that I hope will be suc
cessful."
The entire room joined in singing the old hymn, the
senator singing lustily with the rest. His fears of fraud
having been allayed, he joined whole heartedly into the
spirit of the meeting.
The singing over, Mrs. Landsdowne offered up a short
prayer. The entire services, thought the senator were not
far different than those in an ordinary church. "Only
more modern," he thought.
The prayer was followed by a moment's silence. Then,
Mrs. Landsdowne proceeded with the services.
"My friends, we are gathered here tonight to seek
solace from our loved ones who have departed, but
before we go any further, I want to introduce a new
member of our little congregation, one whom you all
know, Senator X, whose little girl departed this world

just recently, but who already is sending messages back,
from Spirit.
"Only this afternoon Senator X posed for a photo
graph for me and when we developed
it,
his child's por
trait was on the plate. Then we took
a
picture of just
the black curtain,
in
the way you all know, and here
also our efforts were crowned with success, for the de
parted one's picture was found on the plate. Here are
the results."
The medium held the pictures
in
the air for every
one to see, and then stepping from the platform passed
them to the senator who avidly took them. Tears came
to his eyes as he examined them. Many of his nearby
neighbors murmured "It's
a
miracle" and others stated
"I, too, have had spirit pictures of my lost ones photo
graphed with me."
As the senator kept looking at the pictures through
his moisture-dimmed eyes, the medium returned to the
platform.
"I also want to announce," she resumed, "that the
senator has contributed $10,000 to our work."
Applause stopped anything else she intended to say,
and the senator had to get up and acknowledge the
salutation.
"I am glad to be with you," he said. "When my little
Fayette was taken from me, as far as the world was
concerned,
I
was through, but now that
I
know that she
is
near me,
I
am content and
I
want to show material
appreciation for the relief our leader Mrs. Landsdowne
has brought me.
I
hope to work with you, to be with
you, and to help you as much as
I
can. Let me now
publicly present Mrs. Landsdowne with my check for
$10,000, as agreed."

As the senator resumed his seat, the applause was
renewed until the medium raised her hand.
"I want to thank you, senator," she said. "With these
funds we can start work at once on the 'home-church,'
as I shall call this new place of worship, and I really
thank God and the Spirits for sending you to me."
Proceeding with the services, the room was darkened
and the regular spirit trumpet * services started. The
senator had never been to anything like this and many
messages came to him from a voice which was ghostly.
The meeting over, the senator rode home content and
happy and slept untroubled.
* * * *
The senator told every one in official Washington, and
otherwise, what had been happening at the medium's
meetings until many people dreaded to see him coming.
From a shrewd political wizard he had become a dod
dering old man who was positively senile in his state
ments about the miracles the medium worked.
Some people were glad to curry favor with him and
attended the medium's sessions. They marveled at the **
table rapping and table levitation in which they partook,
and many went back and became converted. Others de
nounced it all a trick and laughed at the senator behind
his back.
Time went on until the vacation season was over and
the Federal employees and their superiors began to drift
back into Washington. There is nowhere where gossip
travels faster than in the Capitol of this country and
soon every one knew of Senator X's experiences with the
medium.

Many in high office came to him and secretly con
fessed their beliefs in the possibility of communication
with the dead, others told him that astrology was a won
derful means of learning the future, and still others said
that it all was a fake, one congressman going so far as
to bring Senator X a copy of "A Medium Among the
Spirits" a book written by the late Harry Houdini ex
posing their operations. The senator glanced at the book
but paid no particular attention to the revelations in it.
However, someone showed him a pronouncement of
the Smithsonian Institute in Washington which stated
that "in general futures are not generally predictable"
and that it had no evidence that spirit mediums really
could get in touch with the other world.
All of this coming together, one thing on top of
another, and because, the shock of Fayette's death had
been lessened by the months which had passed, caused
the senator to start a private investigation of Mrs.
Landsdowne. The shrewd old brain was functioning
again, and he came to New York to talk to an investi
gator of the Parent Assembly of the Society of American
Magicians which, in co-operation with Edward P. Mul-
rooney, Police Commissioner of the Metropolis, were
engaged in a drive against fraudulent mediums and for
tune tellers.
Privately, the senator confessed that he had spent
more than $18,000 in three months with Mrs. Lands
downe and wanted the magician to find out how much
truth there was in her statements, and if the pictures
were actually made with the help of the spirits.
The senator detailed everything that had taken place
and certain of the stunts were immediately duplicated in
New York by the magicians. This further convinced the

senator all was not well, so he persuaded a member of
the Parent Assembly of the Society of American Magi
cians (who prefers to be nameless) to come to Washing
ton with him.
Here the magician was introduced to the medkim as a
man who had just lost his only son. The medium ex
pressed great interest, especially when he exhibited a
photograph of "this boy." She was most sympathetic, and
asked the senator to bring his bereaved friend to that
night's meeting.
This was done and Mrs. Landsdowne asked to see the
picture of his dead son. She passed this picture about the
room and then started the services. The photograph was
not returned to the magical investigator until the session
was over, it being brought back by one of the congre
gation.
A meeting was held the next day at which were present
the magician in his guise as "bereaved father" and the
same performance that the senator had first gone through
was undertaken by the medium with her "new follower."
The same trip to Eastman's for plates, the same pos
ing for the photograph, the same darkroom procedure
and the same results.
Let us, from here on read the report received from
the investigator.
"After hearing about the first episode, the message in the
sealed envelope being read, it was easy for the investigator to
know alcohol had been used to make the envelope transparent.
"The medium probably used a pen with a false top. In this top
was a sponge dipped in alcohol. Forcing a few drops from the
sponge on to her dress, the medium rubbed the face of the en
velope over the wet spot. It was then easy to read the message,
for alcohol makes paper transparent.

"The next thing was to answer the question. As Fayette was
well known in Washington, it had been an easy matter to collect
information about her, and somewhere, or someone, possibly even
a servant, let slip the senator's pet name for his girl. The medium,
with a good retentive memory, simply used her knowledge.
"The senator was 'hooked' from the first second he heard the
medium state his daughter's nickname. In his grief he probably
forgot that it was possible for the medium to have gathered that
fact from others. She knew who the senator was, no one in Wash
ington wouldn't, and the rest was easy.
"Coming now to the photography, everything was fair and
square about the loading of the plates and the actual photography.
As a matter of fact, it all looked on the level for a while, par
ticularly when she let me take the plate holders and load them.
It wasn't until she asked me to write my name on the bottom of
one of the plates that I got wise to the racket.
"Of course, she was using the Rev. Father C. M. de Heredia's
method. (See Fig. i.) I was particularly sure of this when the
'my son's* picture showed up on the plate, for the photograph of
'my boy* was one of John Mulholland, first vice president of the
Parent Assembly No. i of the Society of American Magicians.
I had shown John's picture as my son's so I'd be able to convince
the medium, in case of a bluff on her part, that I had the goods
on her.
"You will probably recall that in Father Heredia's method
he used a concealed, reduced picture of the one who was the
'spirit' which was covered with luminous paint of the calcium
sulphide type which becomes radiant on exposure to light.
"In this method, when the medium hands the plate to the
dupe to be signed, he has the image of the photograph concealed
in his hand and because the lighter portions of the doctored photo
graph reflected rays of light, and the darker portions absorbed the
rays, when he pressed his palm against the plate about to be de
veloped, obviously the same transition of the silver bromide coat
ing takes place as if the plate had actually been exposed to light.

Stud}' the drawings herewith carefully for complete details of
how the medium works.
"Mrs. Landsdowne got the same results for me she got for
the senator when Fayette's picture came up. On Mulholland's
picture, the halo came out about his head the same as before.
While John may deserve one, the time isn't ripe yet.
"Of course, you know that the medium used the time honored
and time worn trick of getting the picture from me when she
passed it about at the night meeting. One of her accomplices
merely took it from the room while the so-called services were
on and made a copy of it. This same copy was used in both pic
tures.
"The pin hole camera idea was in use to get the halo effect.
(See Fig. 3.) The copy of the picture to be reproduced is put
on in a regular printing frame and an exposure made in the regu
lar way—but, note the picture. A pin hole had been made in the
side of the bellows and through this, light streaked the halo.
Of course, she must have wasted a lot of bellows to get the pin
hole in the right place, but it must have been worth it.
"Pin hole photography is well known, having been used for
years, and even today, such great photographers as Stieglitz, do
much pictorial work with pin hole cameras. Either Mrs. Lands
downe or one of her assistants knows a great deal about photog
raphy, for it's no cinch to get the exposure through the pin hole
correctly timed to produce the halo effect. As a matter of fact,
it would have been easier to have an air brush artist paint a halo
on the head of the photograph being copied, and then photograph
the whole thing. That's what some mediums do.
"The use of the Graflex, or second camera was all for show.
No picture was actually taken when the senator flashed the lights
on and off. That was only for effect.
"What really happened was this—the medium has a plate pre
pared for the senator's visit, on which she had previously made
a copy of Fayette's head with the halo in place. All she had to
do in the darkroom was to 'swap' or exchange plates, substituting

the prepared one (unseen, of course) for the one the senator
thought he had personally selected and loaded.
"After we left Mrs. Landsdowne, and after I told her what
a miracle it all was, I explained to the senator (a game old
gentleman) just how the whole thing was worked. Of course,
Madame Marie was an accomplice (as a matter of fact it might
have been the medium herself, because I tried to check on the
'Egyptianologist' and found no trace of her), and as everyone
knew the senator's face, it was easy for the fakers to get a pic
ture of Fayette.
"With all the papers running her picture and discussing her
death, it was very simple for the medium or one of her associates
to find a photographer who would sell a picture of Fayette to her.
While photographers won't sell pictures of their clients to anyone
who calls, an old racket of the mediums is to phone and state
'this is a such and such a newspaper. We want a picture of Miss
so and so. We'll give you a credit line,' and, of course, the studio
attendants fall for the yarn.
"I explained to the senator other ways of working the spirit
photo game and I'm sending you herewith the diagram I drew
for him. Maybe you can use it in one of your stories. (See Fig
ures 3, 4 and 6.) I also told him of other methods and he was
quite convinced he was stung badly.
"However, he is certainly a good sport. He said that it was
worth real money to him to have gotten the relief the medium's
fakes brought him, but he was certainly sore at the deception
practiced on other people.

CHAPTER V
THE SUN WORSHIPERS
Charles Edward Purdy, Ph.D., D.Sc, B.S., for more
than twenty years, had been professor of Anthropology
in a fairly large university in Middletown. His life was
wrapped up in his studies of mankind and his wife Eliza
beth, with whom he lived in a seven-room house on the
outskirts of the city, happy and contented.
Dr. Purdy's living room walls were decorated with
strange and weird relics of little known and forgotten
tribes, which he had collected in his research and study.
From the far-off Tibetan Mountains were death masks
of wizards who hundreds of years ago had passed to the
Great Beyond; from the Steppes of Turkestan were
prayer rugs of the Mongol Horde of Genghis Khan;
from the Golden City of Cathay were remnants of silk
and wall coverings, and from the Inca district were fierce-
looking stone clubs, some of which were stained a dark
brown rust color—blood, dried centuries.
One day Dr. Purdy was hard at work on a manuscript
which he was sure would be as startling as Einstein's
Theory of Relativity, when he heard a faint cry,
"Charles, come quickly!" from somewhere downstairs.
He ran down to the living room and was stunned to
see his wife unconscious and crumpled over the threshold.
He tenderly lifted her to the couch. There he tried to
revive her, without success, and then phoned for the dean
of the Medical Center of the college, an old crony of his.

By the time the dean arrived, Dr. Purdy had un
dressed and put his wife to bed. The physician examined
her, and then felt for a pulse that no longer beat.
"I'm sorry, Charles," he said, "but she has passed on."
"No, no," Dr. Purdy groaned, "it can't be." The cold
man of science had vanished and left only a lonely man
who felt the end of the world had come.
"Apoplexy," his medical friend replied. "At sixty we
must expect such things."
Dr. Purdy was stunned and broken. He attended the
funeral in a daze and returned to his home lonely, lost
and disconsolate. He went away for a month to recover,
never looking back as he walked down the path from the
house which had seen the spark of his existence vanish.
Returning after his trip to the college, throwing him
self into his work, he tried to find relief in study.
As Dr. Purdy left the house one morning, several
weeks after his return, the postman halted him and
handed him a letter. In the corner of the envelope was
neatly printed "The Cult." Puzzled, he opened the letter
and read:
My Dear Dr. Purdy:
We address you as a widower as well as a man of science.
We do not know how much you have investigated the possibility
of receiving word from the Other World, from your wife, but
at a meeting last night our medium received word from her con
trol, Lucarius the Sun Worshiper, that your earthly wife had
joined his circle in spirit and had a message for you.
If you will make an appointment at your convenience we will
arrange for our medium to see if she can get a message for you.
Yours in Belief,
The Cult,
by Eve Wrigley.

Dr. Purdy studied the letter, read it over many times,
and put it in his pocket as he drove to the college. His
mind was not on his students, but on the letter, so he let
his assistant take over his classes.
He went to the college library to see what "authorities
had to say about spirit communications with the living."
Here he read voluminous tomes on mediums and spirit
ualism. He found Sir Oliver Lodge and Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle were believers in the possibility of communication
from the other world, but he also found learned profes
sors' books denying the possibility.
Swayed between belief and disbelief in the possibility
of getting a message from his wife, but alone, with time
hanging heavily on his hands, he phoned Miss Wrigley
who made an appointment for that night.
Still skeptical, but hoping against hope that some sign
from his wife would be forthcoming, he entered the large
frame building, on the door of which was a small and
neat sign, "The Cult." Miss Wrigley herself opened the
door and ushered him into a room simply furnished, yet
impressive in its dignity.
On a table to the right of the room, near a huge red,
plush-covered chair on which was a crest of Victorian
days, were a Bunsen burner such as used in laboratories,
and near it an ordinary coal stove poker. To the left of
the poker was an oil lamp. The wick in the lamp was
burning, casting an eerie shadow over the table despite
the indirect lighting system which gave the room a mod
ern effect. The glass top of the lamp glowed red.
In the room were three women and two men, and to
all of them Dr. Purdy was introduced.
"They are all members of our cult," Miss Wrigley ex
plained, "and we are waiting for Madame Lupe, our

medium. All of us have lost some dear one from earthly
contact, but we have remained in touch with them in the
Spirit World through Madame Lupe."
Dr. Purdy listened politely, still unconvinced, while the
others in the room gave evidence of what they had heard.
Miss Wrigley changed the subject and began to talk of
the Sun Worshiper of old. Here Dr. Purdy was quite at
home, and for many minutes both discussed this cult of
centuries ago.
"Madame Lupe had heard all the things of which I
speak directly from the voice of Lucarius, who tells us he
was a High Priest of the Sun Worshipers at Armac, a
forgotten village in old Mexico. He tells us of the sacri
fices of living virgins on the fire-block to appease the sun,
and further explains that he and all the other priests
were impervious to heat or fire because of the Sun God's
will."
The entrance of a woman arrayed in a simple white
smock broke up the talk. She was introduced to Dr.
Purdy as the "High Priestess of our Cult," who has been
given the powers of her control, Lucarius, "to withstand
heat or fire and to receive messages from the Spirit
World through him."
The long and apparently intelligent talk on the Sun
Worshipers interested Dr. Purdy and made him less
skeptical. When he was asked to sit next to Miss Wrigley
he was ready to obey.
"All of us now will sing 'Glory Be to Jesus's Name'
in order that, even though we believe in the life here
after, our voices will carry to the Son of Man, Who may
aid us in our quest for information from the Kingdom
of which He is Lord."
After the singing, Madame Lupe asked all to join

hands and form the Sun Worshipers' Circle, for she ad
monished them :
"Joined together in spirit though we may be, we must
join our flesh so the good of all of us will flow through
the unbroken link thus formed."
The seven joined hands and waited for the medium's
next words. Dr. Purdy joined in the ceremonies whole
heartedly.
"Friends, earthbound creatures," the medium intoned,
"we are gathered here to pay homage to those of us who
are no longer on this sphere, but who have ascended to
a better and brighter one. We also are gathered here to
seek the solace and comfort of any words my control may
bring from the other world.
"I will now release myself from the link we have just
formed with our hands, but you will please all make the
link again. That's right, all hold hands, just as you were,
until I again return in spirit as well as in body."
With these words Madame Lupe rose, walked back a
few steps, took a tchair covered with dark plush and
seated herself. As she did she closed her eyes. As though
this were a signal, Miss Wrigley began to speak.
"Watch closely our priestess as she goes in spirit to
the Other World. Now she is of the Spirit World and no
longer mortal until she is released from the trance of her
control, Lucarius, the High Priest of the Sun Wor
shipers."
Hardly had Miss Wrigley stopped speaking when the
silence of the room was broken with a loud scream from
Madame Lupe. As all eyes fastened on the medium she
began to squirm and moan and groan in most unearthly
fashion. Her eyelids jerked spasmodically, although her
eyes never opened.

Suddenly she began to speak in some queer, unintel
ligible tongue. Louder and louder, faster and faster, she
spoke in a hollow, deep and soul-stirring monotone. Sud
denly she stopped. Her eyelids opened. The pupils of her
eyes were not visible. Only the whites showed.
The silence was intense. A queer thrill ran through Dr.
Purdy. His analytical mind was no longer working.
"Oh, Lucarius," moaned the medium, "thou and I
have spoken in thy native tongue, whose syllables these
earthbound know not. Thou, who knowest all things in
the Spirit World, listen to what I say to, and of, those
gathered, in the tongue they know.
"There is a newcomer here, one who neither knows
nor is initiated. Bring to him some message or some sign
that his lately departed is with you. In my mind place
thy words in thy native tongue and I will translate them
to him. Bring thou, now, the signs and words."
The medium rose from her chair as though she were
walking in her sleep. The whites of her pupilless eyes
looked ghastly. Her hand shook as though she had palsy.
Her face was streaming with perspiration. It was flushed
and unnatural.
"I ask thee," she pleaded, "do the things you did as
a High Priest of the Sun Worshipers, through me, O
great Lucarius! I will obey. Make me impervious to
flame, even as thou wert in olden times."
Crossing to the oil lamp, which was still burning, with
her bare hands Madame Lupe picked up its white hot
glass globe ! She then placed it on a piece of paper, which
instantly blazed up. Crushing out the fire with her long
tapering fingers, she cast the charred papers on the floor.
The medium then held her hand in the center of the
flames of the burning oil of the lamp !

"Oh, great control, I have performed the first ritual
of heat and fire and have come through untouched and
unhurt. What other tests do you demand of me? I am
unafraid, for no incarnated Sun Worshiper as I can
be hurt by fire or flame if under your control. I wait to
obey. Silently tell me."
Again the quiet became intense. The watchers had seen
the medium deliberately place her hands in fire and not
even get singed. They had seen her defy fire that burns
and consumes. Dr. Purdy, in particular, was amazed and
almost convinced that the medium possessed unnatural
powers. He watched her intently as she moved the oil
burner closer to her face.
With a loud moan and sudden twitching of her shoul
ders she threw her head directly over the flame and let
her hair fall into it.
There was no smell of burning hair, no smoke aris
ing from the tresses. No sound from the medium. As
suddenly as she had thrown her hair in the flames she
withdrew it. She then lit the Bunsen burner, which was
attached to the gas jet. In the hottest part of this flame
she placed an ordinary fire poker. As she waited for it
to grow red-hot, she chanted :
"Oh, great priest of the Sun Worshipers, I prepare
myself for the final ordeal, through which I know I shall
pass unscathed under your watchful protection."
She opened the top of her dress, exposing the white
flesh of her bosom. Her eyes seemed to be without pupils
—only the whites showing.
"Lucarius, mighty one, in this gathering is the novice.
Let him pick up the iron that now glows to a brilliance
hardly surpassed by the sun whom we revere, and let him

try to pierce or burn my heart while my soul is in your
keeping!"
Dr. Purdy was reluctant to move. Madame Lupe
almost pulled him toward the iron, which now glowed
red in the flame. Her half-bared body, her wildly di
sheveled hair, her apparently sightless eyes, and the eerie,
weird stillness of the room frightened him. Tremblingly
he followed the medium toward the table on which
rested the Bunsen burner and iron. He seemed almost
unconscious of what was transpiring. Picking up the
poker, Madame Lupe offered the cool end to him, hold
ing the red-hot part in her bare hands ! But he did not
touch it.
Suddenly baring her entire chest to the waist, the me
dium motioned to him to take the red-hot iron and press
it to her flesh over her heart, crying in that maddening
monotone :
"Oh, Lucarius, the end is here if thou are not with
me. Watch thou my soul. I believe in thee and thy Sun
Worshipers !"
Dr. Purdy could not move. He was as though para
lyzed. Fascinated, he watched the medium, who, with
a sudden move thrust the poker which was still glowing
red from the severe heat to which it had been exposed,
under her left breast, directly over her heart!
Purdy gasped as she took the smoking iron from her
flesh. She was not scathed ! Silently she placed the poker
back on the table, and where it touched the wood, it
burned great scars in the table top.
Purdy fearfully returned to his seat as the medium
went back to the throne chair, adjusting her dress.
As though talking to her Spirit Control, with head
uplifted the medium chanted:

"Now that I have proven myself to be of the Sun
Worshipers, impervious to fire, let me ask you to bring
from this Elizabeth, earth wife of the one who has just
joined us, some message to her dearly beloved."
Dr. Purdy edged forward on his chair. The medium
was going through contortions, with strange sounds of
agony, moaning and groaning as she swayed. Then she
began to speak again, never using an inflection but speak
ing as though she were learning a lesson and repeating it
after her teacher.
"Tell Charles I am well and happy here. I never knew
I was leaving him, nor did I feel pain when my soul and
spirit came here, leaving my body behind. Tell him not
to grieve or worry, for I will send him messages until he
joins me in Spirit World.
"Tell him I see a condition of prosperity surrounding
him. I see his book on which he has worked so steadily,
and on which I helped him, become a great sensation
throughout the world.
"Tell him further that though my physical body may
not be with him as he writes, that my spirit hovers over
him. I see a white dove circling over his head. It has
alighted on his shoulder. It is a spirit dove and indicates
peace for him. Ask him to continue coming to these meet
ings and I will bring him comfort and tell of the things
that are to be. Farewell, oh, Charles. I go, but I return!"
The medium gave a loud shriek and put her hand to
her mouth. She fell on the floor as though stricken.
Miss Wrigley jumped up and ran to her. As she raised
her, Dr. Purdy could see a white foam pouring from her
mouth. Miss Wrigley washed this away with some water
that was in the basin on the small table, and escorted

Madame Lupe to her chair. Once seated, the medium
opened her eyes and asked :
"Did I go through the ordeal? Did Lucarius come to
me? Did I get a message for our new member?"
Those seated about the table now unclasped each
others' hands and rushed to congratulate the medium.
Dr. Purdy alone did not move. He was in a daze. Grace
fully waving aside the compliments of the believers, the
medium went to Dr. Purdy. Looking into his face, with
eyes that seemed tender and understanding, she spoke.
"My friend," she said, "I understand. Do not fear
or worry or doubt. Your wife is still with you, for as she
lived with you in this world so does she now exist for
you in the Other. Come often to me and I will bring
you words of joy and comfort and advice from her."
Time went on. Dr. Purdy visited the home of The Cult
more and more. He became a full fledged member. He
spread the gospel to his fellow professors, even telling
his students of the possibility of communication with
the Spirit World. He contributed more and more of his
savings to The Cult, and gradually grew so rabid on the
subject that his friends avoided him, and his work at the
college and on his book alike suffered.
After he had been a member of The Cult for about
five months, during a regular seance patterned very much
after that first session, Madame Lupe, "Speaking for
Lucarius," said that the time had come to spread the
news of the Sun Worshipers' miracles to other fields.
Lucarius suggested, through the medium, that contri
butions be taken for the missionary work from all true
believers.
At this same session a "message came through for
Charles from Elizabeth" which suggested Dr. Purdy

mortgage his home, and "as we had no children, take
the cash surrender value of your life insurance policies,
Charles, and give all your earthly possessions to the
cause."
In the spirit of a Crusader, Dr. Purdy mortgaged his
home, cashed his life insurance, and contributed the en
tire amount —twenty-four thousand dollars —to The
Cult, giving it in actual cash to Miss Wrigley for the
purposes of propaganda.
And he resigned his position with the university so
that he could give his entire time to spreading the gospel
of spirit communication throughout the world. His resig
nation was turned over to the president of the college
at noon of the morning that he gave his donation to
the cause.
Directly from the office of the college he went to
the home of The Cult to surprise his fellow Sun Wor
shipers. He thought how happy they would be to know
that he would give his whole time from now on to aiding
them in the great work.
As he walked happily up the steps of The Cult home,
he noticed the door was closed and that several people
were attempting to get in. Wondering how so many peo
ple had been converted so quickly, much as a minister
talks to his flock, he asked if he could do anything for
them.
To his consternation one of the men at the door threw
back his coat and announced that he was a deputy sheriff
with a dispossess notice. Another said he was a collector
for an installment furniture house. The only woman pres
ent said she had given Madame Lupe nine thousand dol
lars to invest in bonds for her, and another man said he
was the husband of Miss Wrigley, who had "run away

from him last year, taking with her his entire life's
savings."
The deputy sheriff broke down the door at the insis
tence of the furniture collector. Everything was the same
as when Dr. Purdy had left the house earlier that day.
But on the table was a note that read :
"Do not look for us. The spirits have told us to
leave."
There was no signature, but Dr. Purdy and the rest
then knew the truth.
The deputy sheriff laughed and said, "It's lucky for
them they got out of town, or Pd've pinched 'em for
fortune telling."
As the rest of the crowd started talking excitedly,
the woman screamed:
"My money is gone. I've been robbed. My nine thou
sand dollars is gone!"
Dr. Purdy fainted. The deputy sheriff caught him as
he collapsed and carried him to a chair. He was revived
finally and an ambulance from the General Hospital took
him away.
For days he lay in a semi-coma, delirious and scream
ing for Lucarius and the Sun Worshipers. When his
physical strength came back, his mind was gone!
He is today in a private sanitarium for the mentally
feeble.
The newspapers unearthed the fact that Madame Lupe
had been convicted in another city for fraud and had
served time in prison under another name. They also
discovered that almost seventy thousand dollars had
been taken in by the medium from her dupes in those
few months that she had operated in Middletown.

In the natural course of events a member of the So
ciety of American Magicians played in Middletown. He
collected all the data on Dr. Purdy's case and sent it
to the author for analysis.
The entire fraud was the work of a clique which has
been working the "Sun Worshipers' Racket" for more
than forty years, and handing it down through the gen
erations. To any one, college professor, scientist or lay
man, the "hot iron" game is most impressive.
To start with, the stage was set for Dr. Purdy's ar
rival. The medium had prepared for the fire test in a
most simple way. This is how she was "impervious to
fire and heat."
From a pharmaceutical supply house she had ob
tained one-half ounce of camphor and two ounces of aqua
vitae. Then she had bought one ounce of quicksilver and
one ounce of liquid styrax and two ounces of pulver
ized red stone. To stand the "fire test of the Sun Wor
shipers" she followed these directions.
Dissolve the camphor in the aqua vitae. Shake well,
then add the quicksilver and styrax. Shake well again
until there is no sediment. Add the pulverized stone.
Shake the entire mixture and let it stand about twelve
hours. There may be a slight reddish tinge to the solu
tion, but this is not a drawback if the medium has a
ruddy skin.
Rub the mixture well on the parts of the body to be
subjected to the flame or hot iron. Many mediums rub
the solution on the soles of their feet and walk over
burning hot coal stoves, or iron grates under which a
vicious fire is burning. The solution, if it is to be used
on the breast with its tender skin, should be allowed to

before the performance.
The styrax is a product of myrrh and absolutely pre
vents the camphor from igniting. The camphor, of
course, is the base of the solution. Any one skilled in
stage craft, as are mediums, can make the Sun Wor
shipers' test most impressive.
The hair in the flame effect upon which the medium
also depends is a simple application of known chemicals.
Take a teacup. Dissolve all the ordinary table salt in
this cup that will dissolve. In another cup dissolve a heap
ing tablespoon of a borax washing soda in warm water.
Mix the two in a bottle. The hair is soaked in it. A fine
solution is made by boiling two tablespoons of soda in
a cup of water. After it dries the medium combs out the
residue, and is ready for the "test."
Readers won't care to experiment with their hair, but
dip a handkerchief or necktie in the salt and soda solu
tion, let the object stay in it for a short time, and after
it dries, put in any flame, large or small. It won't burn if
left in the fire even for several minutes.
It may seem strange that a man as learned as Dr.
Purdy would be taken in by the Sun Worshiper "racket,"
but think back. After twenty-four years of married life
his wife died suddenly. His mind was in a turmoil. At
his age, sixty-two, naturally he could not think as clearly
and sharply as at thirty or forty. The stress of his emo
tions and the weirdness of the spectacle dimmed his
powers of perception.
His case is not the only one of a learned savant who
believed in the gibberish of a fake medium. The simplest
tricks of mediums are seldom seen through by even very
clever men. That is a question of psychology. The clever

man thinks straight and true, the fortune teller or faker
along the lines of fraud.
Obviously, the facts of the life of Dr. Purdy and his
wife had been gathered by Miss Wrigley or Madame
Lupe from neighbors, storekeepers and students in the
professor's classes.
The "foam" gushing from the mouth of the medium
is passed off on the unsuspecting believer as "ectoplasm."
It is simply done. The medium has a small piece of soap
concealed in her costume. Taking it out unseen she makes
a quick move to her mouth and places it under her tongue.
As she falls to the floor in a fake faint, she rubs saliva
against the tongue, producing a lather. Her assistant, if
you recall, quickly "revived" her, and in the process,
wiped the soapy foam away. It's effective, this stunt,
though it doesn't taste very well.
Do not confuse genuine and sincere spiritualists with
fake mediums. Genuine spiritualists never recommend oil
stocks, investments, or charge exorbitant fees, nor do
they "materialize" ghosts. They are sincere believers in
their faith.

CHAPTER VI
TRUMPETS OF THE DEAD
George Luis, after wearily visiting every employment
agency on Sixth and Seventh Avenues between Twenty-
Sixth and Forty-Fifth Streets, and hearing nothing but
the same melancholy, discouraging "Nothing today" at
every stop, was tiredly plodding his way uptown to his
home on East 53rd Street near Second Avenue. Every
step he took was torture, every move physical and men
tal anguish, for he had been out of work for eleven weeks
and his savings of many years were gradually dwindling
away, for no matter how economically he lived, it still
took money, and a great deal, to support his little family.
As he walked slowly onward, he traced mentally every
step in his life since his arrival in New York twelve years
ago. He recalled how he had almost jumped for joy when
the Lamport & Holt boat, which had brought him from
his native land in Brazil slowly steamed past the Statue
of Liberty, which seemed to him to proudly hold her
torch high in the air to welcome newcomers to the "Land
of the Free." He remembered how he got his first job
as a construction helper on the subway because he had
come with such good recommendations from the Ameri
can bridge builder for whom he worked in South America.
The recollections of his rapid promotions as he learned
English flashed through his mind; the day he met Lola,
daughter of Jose Huerta, the cigar maker, her promise
to marry him when he had taken out his first citizenship

papers, their marriage, and the coming of the babies, all
marched in steady procession across his aching brain.
The steadily growing bank balance, for he and Lola lived
simply, the day he received his final papers which made
him an American citizen, all were reviewed as he slowly
walked on.
Then the depression, the curtailing of employment that
found him, for the first time in twelve years, without a
position. It was like the unfolding of a play on a movie
screen, this vivid succession of every phase of his life.
Each time he put his foot forward, another thought of
the past came to him.
Slowly but surely he reached 53rd Street, and as he
turned in at the entrance of the flat in which he lived, he
wondered what he could tell Lola, and how he could tell
her, that another day had passed without his getting a
position.
Going up the three flights of stairs, he kept thinking
and thinking. His mind raced as his feet faltered.
He had hardly time to put his key in the lock when
the door of his flat opened. Lola threw her arms about
his neck, kissed him as only the Latin American women
can, and asked, with hope in her voice, but fear in her
heart:
"You did get something, George, didn't you?"
The words seemed caught in his mouth. He tried to
talk, but couldn't. It was hard to disappoint such a help
mate. He slowly shook his head in the negative.
Lola smiled bravely at him, took his hand and led
him into the little room that served as living room during
the day, and bedroom at night. They only had a three
room apartment and the three children slept in what
was a dining room at meal times.

"Don't you care," she said lovingly. "Things will get
better. I just know they will for today, a Mrs. Paestro,
who lives down the block, called to make my acquaintance
and said that when things looked blackest to her, after
she had lost her husband last month, it all turned out
well. She met a woman who talks with the dead, and be
cause sKe knuWi} [he spirits so well, they give her advice."
George's^superslTtTous mind ran quickly over the pos
sibilities of a ghost who might help him, but gave it up
sadly for none of his family were dead, and besides the
church forbade such intercourse with the spirits.
"The friend of the dead," he told Lola, "might help
this Mrs. Paestro, but she couldn't help me, for I know
none who is dead, and besides you know the father at
the church told us such things are false. Anyway, how
could she help us? All I want is a job. Put the thought
of ghosts out of your mind. It is not well even to think
of them."
With this, he made the Sign of the Cross, and took
off his coat, through with the subject. But Lola continued,
not seeming to mind George's lack of interest:
"Mrs. Paestro told me that ghosts of all sorts came
and gave this woman messages, whether or not they
are spirits we knew in real life. They call her in English
a 'spirit medium'. That means that she acts as a hombrc
ag—there I go talking our old native tongue —in our
new language she's a 'go-between' between spirits, and
what she calls the "earthbound1. Jiarthbound people are
those living in this world just like we are now," she said.
"Why, Mrs. Paestro told me she had given this spirit
medium $2,000 which she got after her husband's death,
and that the ghosts had doubled it in three days. Now,

won't you talk about ghosts? If they'll do that for Mrs.
Paestro, they'll certainly do it for us !"
"Lola, be quiet. You know Father Kelley told us at the
last retreat at the mission that no one could talk to
spirits or ghosts and that the Church wouldn't let any
one go to a person claiming he could talk to the dead."
And as they sat down to the little supper Lola had pre
pared, all talk of mediums was dropped, for the children
came in from the park. They ranged from sixteen months
to five years in age and had been taken out by one of the
neighbors. The elder two greeted their father affection
ately, and the baby cooed in his arms as he took her
from the friendly woman. Lola lovingly arranged her
little family about the table, and they prepared to eat.
Supper over and the dishes washed, they put the chil
dren to bed. George and Lola talked but little after
these chores were done, although both tried to cheer the
other up. Their davenport became a bed, they undressed,
knelt in prayer and another day was over for both of
them.
* * * *
George was up and about at 6 o'clock on the following
morning, ready for another day of struggle. He was
always first in line at the better agencies, because even
in Spanish there is a proverb, "The early bird catches the
worm." With four mouths to feed, he wanted to get what
work he could to keep the house going, for he dreaded
touching the few thousand dollars left of his savings.
Lola gave him a sustaining breakfast, economical but
healthy, and he was off.
Then the children had to be looked after. Mornings
passed quickly for Lola, for whether George found work

or hoi, her work as mother and housewife was never
done. For when the mornings were over, lunch time came.
And when lunch was served and the dishes washed, came
the time for the children to be taken out. And when the
children came back from the afternoon in the air, they
had to be bathed and dressed. Then came the preparation
of the supper. Monotony lightened only by love and duty.
This day the children never seemed more disobedient,
the lunch dishes never seemed harder to do and life never
seemed to hold less. In the midst of this despondent
despair, the bell rang. It was Mrs. Paestro, all wreathed
in smiles and obviously at peace with the world.
"Well, dearie," she commenced, after she had greeted
Lola with an all encompassing embrace, "are you and
that husband of yours ready to come with me some time
to the medium who'll ask the ghost about your making
your fortunes?"
"No," replied Lola unhappily. "Quxjeligion tells_us
not to have traffic with the dead. George and I talked
about
it,
but we are determined not to do it. Though,
Lord knows, I'd like to try. Things never seemed blacker.
George can't find work, this apartment
is
so tiny, the
children are on my nerves and while we are told 'Heaven
will provide' I'm beginning to doubt. Though that
in
itself
is
a
sin."
Lola began to cry hysterically. The feeling of help
lessness, that nothing was worth while, that her lot was
an unhappy one, coupled with the constant dread of see
ing the hard won savings of many years wiped out, com
pletely unnerved her.
Mrs. Paestro tried to calm her, but to no avail. She
only began to quiet down when Mrs. Paestro told her

that she'd go herself to the medium and ask her to talk
to the ghosts on George's behalf.
"Then, it's no sin for you," Mrs. Paestro comforted
her. "I'll find out for George and you, and then you'll
not be disobeying your church."
Lola brightened up immediately. Surely there was no
sin connected with that, she repeated to herself again.
Mrs. Paestro left for the medium immediately. Lola
began to sing as she dressed the older children and
changed the baby. Maybe, the Lord hadn't deserted her.
Maybe the ghost would know just where George could
get work.
How the rest of the afternoon flew. Oh, if Mrs.
Paestro would only get back before George. Hurry,
hurry, hurry, she wished. Footsteps. The bell rang. Mrs.
Paestro was back!
"What news," she cried. "Will George get work?
Will the ghosts tell the future for us? Will the medium
advise usV Quick! Tell me all, amigo."
"I've good news indeed. The medium says that George
will get work today or tomorrow. And the salary will
be a good one. She says that this is the only message
the spirits will deliver through a third party, but that
they have many more for you or George if you call in
person."
Mrs. Paestro had hardly stopped speaking when
George's steps were heard outside the door. Lola didn't
wait for him to use the key. She threw the door open.
George was all smiles. He picked her up, raised her in
the air, kissed her and cried:
"Honey, I've got a job. A real job. The B.M.T. starts
building the extension in Queens tomorrow and I'm fore

man for the sub-contractor! Think of it. Foreman!
Thanks be to the Father, Son and Holy Ghost."
As George let Lola to the floor he made the Sign of
the Cross. Lola did likewise. As she did, George spied
Mrs. Paestro for the first time sitting on the davenport.
Lola introduced her to her husband.
"Congratulate me," he demanded of her. "Though
you be a stranger, I know you will be glad for Lola
says you have befriended her."
"I certainly will, but I knew it," the visitor answered
complacently. "I just told your wife that the spirit
medium brought me word that before the sun went
down tomorrow night, you'd have a position."
"No, it could not have been the medium," George
stated emphatically, "It was the Lord, for only last
night I prayed to Him for aid."
Mrs. Paestro left after exchanging a few commonplace
remarks, and the talk turned again to the position George
had obtained. Lola was not shaken in her belief that the
ghosts had something to do with the getting of the fore-
manship, while George was equally emphatic in telling
her to forget such nonsense.
For days the arguments went on, ghosts versus old
time religion. Repeating part of a visiting priest's sermon
of which they had a printed copy, George argued, read
ing from the statement of the Church :
"Does it not seem amazing to you that darkness, an omen of
the Prince of Evil, concealer of crime and vice, friend of murderer
and thief, can be converted to the use of something passing under
the guise of religion? Are not our services held in the light? Are
not our actions visible? Why, then, does this strange religion re
quire darkness, the blanket of Orcus to conceal its actions? We
can almost change the word 'actions' to 'villainies.'

"In America it is given to all of us to worship as one wills, and
it does not behoove any of us to criticize the religion of others,
but this new menace to the peace of the nation, this conversing
with the dead, surpasses religious devotions. It wrecks the home,
it leaves poverty and misery in its path, and many times causes
death and suicide.
"No one is given the power to foresee or prophesy. All that
attempt it defy the laws of God and man and must suffer. Re
member the words of St. Paul in which he says, without reserva
tions, '// is not well to look upon the dead or to try to learn their
tongue, neither is it wise to use the power of prophesying or to
foretell the future!' Elsewhere he condemns witchcraft and for-
tune telling by the method of summoning the spirits of the dead.
"In all of the writings of this apostle, one finds that women can
not act as ministers, priests or prophets, yet in this new religion,
women for the most part act as so-called mediums between the
living and the dead. To our parishioners, does the Holy Catholic
Church of Rome, which was founded by our Lord when He said
'Thou art Peter and on this Rock shall I build My Church,'
which has survived through the ages, say to you 'Have no traffic
with those who would have you believe they converse with the
dead, for to God alone is given this power.'
"
As George finished reading these paragraphs for the
fiftieth time, Lola nodded her head slowly, and hope
fully asked :
"George, maybe the Church didn't mean this particu
lar medium. She knew about your job, and certainly it
will do no harm to just talk to her."
Again the argument continued until early in the morn
ing, George heartsick and unhappy, Lola stubborn and
uncertain.
When George left for work in the morning, Lola went
to her friendly neighbor and asked if she'd look after
her children for a while. When she agreed, Lola almost

ran to Mrs. Paestro's home nearby, of which she had
the address, and blurted out:
"George won't listen about the medium but I have a
feeling I MUST talk to her. Won't you take me?"
Mrs. Paestro explained that she never had been to
a medium's in the morning, but would be glad to tele
phone to make an appointment. This done, Lola and she
left for the medium's home.
Arriving, they were ushered into a room heavily cur-
tained with black drapes. The silence as of the tomb was
impressive. The room was bare except for an ordinary
kitchen table, painted black, . aad some chairs that also
were o^tHe same color. There was a Bible in the center
of the table, and a small incense burner giving off an odd
erotic perfume. It was weird, this setting, to the visitor
who had come to see what the future held for her doubt
ing husband and herself.
Mrs. Paestro whispered :
"I've actually seen ghosts in this room, dear. They
may be here now, but we can't see them. The medium
can, however, and they bring her messages."
The door opened quietly. There was no sound as she
crossed the room to where her visitors sat. She stood
in front of them. She was a middle-aged woman of drab
appearance; sincerity seemed written in her face. In her
hand she carried_a Jgj^ia^e^ghaped trumpet made" pf
metal,_pamted jet black.
'Mrs. Paestro and Lola rose. The former spoke:
"Mrs. Clark, permit me to introduce Mrs. Lola Luis,
a friend of mine who is anxious to know what the spirits
can tell you about her husband and herself. This is the
lady whose husband I asked you about. You told me he
would get a position, and sure enough he did."

In a deep monotone, without inflection, Mrs. Clark
acknowledged the introduction.
"My dear, I am glad to welcome you to my modest
little material home. My body dwells heref but my spirit,
of course, is in the other world, If there is anything I can
do for you, I will beHglad to try to get advice from my
control, the great Indian guide, White Feather."
Lola smiled sheepishly.
"There is nothing special, Mrs. Clark," she said. "I
just wanted to visit you, Mrs. Paestro has said so much
about you, including telling me how your advice had
made so much money for her, that I felt an urge to
come."
"That urge," replied the medium, "was not un
natural. One of my friends in the Spirit World came
to you and told you to come here. However, let us see if
the spirits are with us this morning. Let us sit down.
Mrs. Paestro, sit here; Mrs. Luis, you sit here, and after
I turn out the lights I will join you.
"When I sit down, all three of us will join hands.
Keep a tight grip on each other's hands, as well as on
mine. I will then see if the spirits will make the table
rise, or if they will speak to us through rapping answers
to my questions. I will place this trumpet on the table,
and if the spirits manifest their presence, I will ask them
to talk to you through it."
As she finished speaking, she rose and put out all the
lights. As the room was suddenly thrown into sudden
total darkness, Lola felt a shudder of apprehension.
The blood almost froze in her veins as the medium
sat down next to her. She took Mrs. Paestro's right
hand with her own left, and then felt the medium's left
hand touch her right one.

She held both Mrs. Paestro's and Mrs. Clark's hands
with a tight grip, breathing faster and faster.
The silence of the room was broken by the medium's
hollow voice.
"Let us sing the first verse of 'Abide With Me' to
bring the proper religious atmosphere into this room."
She started singing lustily, with Mrs. Paestro joining
in. All Lola could do was weakly hum the tune. The
medium spoke again:
"Oh, great spirit, my own guide, the mighty White
Feather, noble chief of a noble tribe, long since in Spirit,
come to me and manifest your willingness to aid this lost
earthbound creature who seeks you through me. If you
be present, signify that presence with one spirit knock
on this table."
She stopped talking. The room was still. Lola held her
breath.
Suddenly there was a heavy knock in the center of the
table. Lola gasped.
The medium spoke again.
"Oh, White Feather, I thank you. By signifying your
presence here you bring strength and confidence to me.
Now, let me ask you to make the table rise as all three
keep our hands on it."
Lola's hands were lifted onto the table, where she
rested them beside Mrs. Clark's and Mrs. Paestro's.
Almost immediately the table began to move. To Lola
it seemed that it was floating about the room. Still grasp
ing Mrs. Paestro's and the medium's hands, she knew
that the ghosts must be making the table rise.
With a jar the table dropped to the floor again. Mrs.
Clark again spoke.

conditions are correct for you to aid me in answering
any questions our new convert may ask. Rap twice on the
table thou hast just made rise, if thou art ready, other
wise rap but once."
Two loud raps disturbed the quiet of the room.
"Good," said the medium to Lola. "I will now release
your hands, and turn on the lights. You can write any
questions you want White Feather to answer. I will bring
you paper and pencil."
The medium rose, turned on the lights, and left the
room. Lola was hardly able to think. She felt that she
had been touched by the hands of the dead, that she had
visited where man should not transgress, and was in con
tact with a spirit which knew all.
The medium returned, bringing with her several small
pieces of cardboard, two inches by three.
She laid these on the table, asked Lola to select three
or four, on each write a single question, and place them
face downward on the table so they couldn't be read.
While Lola was writing her questions, the medium
stepped back to the doorway.
Lola finished writing, put her cardboards together
in a single pile, face downward, and then announced ner
vously that she was ready for the answers. The medium
came to her side, asked her to concentrate on the ques
tions, picked up the spirit trumpet from the end of the
table on which it rested, and stated:
"I will put out the lights again. When I sit down,
please note that the questions are in front of the seeker
after knowledge, that the trumpet is also in front of
her and that the questions are beyond my reach. Please
take my hands again after the lights are off. That insures
my not being able to reach either trumpet or questions."

Mrs. Clark put out the light, sat down at the table
again, took Lola's hands as before, and apparently
reached for Mrs. Paestro's. All was silent for a moment
and then, in the same deep monotone, the medium spoke.
"Oh, Great White Feather, again listen to my prayer.
As my hands are held by the friends of this circle, I beg
of you to take up the trumpet and answer the questions
which have been written."
Lola distinctly felt the trumpet being picked up and
moved past her head. A whistling noise, then moaning
and groaning came Trom it. There was silence for a few
-seconds." lherTTvIrs. Clark was heard to speak.
"""A'rtfthou wifh us, oh, Spirit to whom I owe all? If
so give a sign ; one rap on the table will suffice."
Another few seconds of silence, and again there was
the same distinctive rap. Then, close to her ear, in a most
ungodly voice, certainly not human, Lola heard :
''Bewitched gold is better than no gold at all. What
gold you can get I will double. Fear not for your hus
band, as he will worship you once you have made him
wealthy beyond his dreams.
"Your children will all grow up well and strong and
become great men and women. There will be a sickness
of the eyes of one child, but that won't matter if you

the room was not broken. Then, a moan seemed to pene
trate the entire room. Rising to a loud shriek the un
earthly cry died gradually away. Lola almost fainted. The
silence again became for a moment almost unbearable,
when it was broken with Mrs. Clark's sepulchral tone
announcing, "The spirits have come—and gone—. There
fore let us again sing "Abide With Me."
As the medium's voice died away on the last note, she
rose. Moving over to the light switch, she turned on
the subdued electric lamp.
As Lola's eyes accustomed themselves to the light,
she looked at the table, trumpet and her pile of questions.
Nothing seemed disturbed. The spirits had even read
her questions in the dark through the cardboard. Surely,
it was a wonderful thing, this manifestation of spirits.
"Mrs. Clark," Mrs. Paestro said, "we can't thank
you enough for this demonstration. What do we owe you
for the messages you brought Mrs. Luis in answer to
her questions?"
"The regular church fee, as you know," the medium
replied, "is what you care to give. Silver donations are
acceptable, but because this is a private reading in my
home, there will be no charge."
"Oh, thank you," Lola gushed. "It's just too wonder
ful of you. But, Mrs. Clark, if you recall, the spirit
said he would double the money I brought him. How can
that be? What do I have to do?"
"Child, I don't know," the medium replied. "The next
time White Feather visits me, I'll ask him, however, and
if he tells me, I'll let you know. But, in the meantime say
nothing of any of this to your husband, for he may be
a disturbing influence. You are doing this out of love for

your man anyway, but if he doesn't understand, it may
lead to quarrels."
Lola and Mrs. Paestro took their leave. Lola could
hardly wait to get out of the house to thank her friend.
"It was wonderful," she said. "If Mrs. Clark lets you
know just what I have to do to double my money, be
sure and tell me at once. You know, George and I have
a joint account at the bank, and I can draw some out,
replace it before he knows
it,
and then surprise him with
the amount the spirit brings me."
Happily Lola went home, mentally buying every good
looking automobile that she saw. She was unmindful of
the squalor
in
the neighborhood.
The afternoon passed so quickly that she hardly knew
it
was dinner time when George came home. She was her
old self again. He was happy to see Lola cheerful and
content once more.
"So you've put the spirits out of your mind, have
you?" he queried.
He thanked his patron saint. Lola silently blessed and
praised the spirits.

Three days went by before Mrs. Paestro visited Lola
again.
"What has happened?" Lola demanded. "Did Mrs.
Clark tell you anything? Quick!"
"Lots of things have happened, dear. Last night at
midnight, strange rapping noises awoke Mrs. Clark.
She saw White Feather
in
her room for the first time.
She actually saw him. Think of it. I'd have been so nerv
ous
I
wouldn't know what to do, but Mrs. Clark said
she didn't mind.
"Anyway, White Feather sent her

She said that a gypsy dressed in brilliant colors was with"
the Indian spirit and that both had imparted a secret for
you.
"You are to take one of your husband's best handker
chiefs, sew up three ends of
it,
leaving one end open.
Then, take as much money as you want to double out
of the bank and bring
it
to Mrs. Clark
in

After you see her, Mrs. Clark will go into
a

"Wonderful! Let me do

we'll go to the bank and to Mrs. Clark."

and jumped to her modest sewing basket. Turning

sewed

medium was still garbed in the black, smocklike dress she
had worn when Lola had first seen her. The medium's
greeting was effusive.
"My dear," she said. "It is so wonderful. Think of
White Feather coming to me in person and bringing his
spirit bride with him. Of course, you know 'bride' is just
a name, for in heaven there is no marriage or giving in
marriage, but the spirits do pick a certain friend of the
opposite sex with whom they always associate.
"Well, this gypsy girl certainly gave me lots of in
formation. Of course, you know all gypsies are brought
up to read the future, so it stands to reason that when
they pass on to the other world, they are good fortune
tellers. You understand, don't you?"
Poor Lola. She nodded her head in understanding and
said:
"I brought the handkerchief you wanted, and I sewed
it just as Mrs. Paestro told me to. What do I do now?"
"Not so fast. It's all very well to let the spirits double
your money, but you'll have to say a prayer or two be
fore. Then we must go get the sanction of White Feather
before anything can be done for you."
The medium escorted Lola to the same room in which
she'd been a few days ago.
"Tell me, dear," the medium asked, once they were
seated, "how much money did you bring?"
Lola told her. Mrs. Clark said that was very nice for
a beginning. She then asked Lola for the handkerchief,
examined
it,
and rose.
"Put the money you brought on the table," she said.
"I'll get some thread so you can sew the money
in
the
handkerchief."

Lola placed the money on the table. She was so happy,
she could hardly contain herself.
The medium came back, bringing with her some heavy
white thread, on a large spool, and a needle.
"First, thread the needle," Mrs. Clark said, "then
we'll be ready."
While Lola worked the heavy thread through the eye
of the needle, the medium took out the light bulb in the
floor lamp and substituted a blue one of a few watts.
The room was shadowy with the light of the dark
ened bulb; the bluish tint threw everything into ghastly
relief.
"We are ready now," the medium said. "Let us ask
White Feather if he is present. One rap means yes, you
recall, and two means no."
Lola held the handkerchief and money tightly in one
hand, the threaded needle in the other. She waited.
Silence. Then:
"Oh, great White Feather, are you ready to aid us?"
A loud knock.
"Thank you, my control. Now may I impart my knowl
edge to the earthbound?"
A loud rap.
" Tis well." Mrs. Clark turned to Lola. "Fold the
money in half. Then fold it again exactly in the center.
Now, see if it fits the pocket in the handkerchief.
Very well, give me both money and handkerchief. I will
place the money in the handkerchief. Let me have the
needle and thread. Watch me now sew the money in the
handkerchief. No, you sew it. Finish those stitches I
have made. Careful, do not sew through the money. Push
in that gold corner showing. Good, that's right."

Mrs. Clark told Lola to take off her waist. This done,
she took the needle and thread, and asked Lola for the
handkerchief.
"My dear, I will sew this money to your clothes."
She sewed the handkerchief in the center of Lola's
vest, and walked directly in front of her.
"On your breast now reposes the earthly funds that
you have brought. Touch not the handkerchief nor take
off your vest until three suns have set. Touch neither be
fore six o'clock of the third day, and then see what has
happened. Have faith and say nothing to any one. Now,
let me impart to you your future as imparted to me by
the Romany maid, a future somewhat as White Feather
first predicted.
"Give me your left hand. That is the fate hand. I
really do not need to take
it,
but the gypsy told me to
repeat these facts only as
I
held it. First, your younger
son will have trouble with his eyes. He may be blind for
a
time, but then the spirits will double or triple your
money and thus you will be in position to relieve his
suffering. Second, your husband may be angry
if
you let
him know about this. Do not mention
it
to any one. That
is
all. Come to me after you open the sewed handker
chief.
I
will then tell you more about your son's eyes."
Lola was stunned by the prophecy about her son, but
cheered by the prospect of the doubled or tripled money.
She took her leave graciously, and left the house hoping
the time would pass quickly until the two suns had set.

Lola went about her daily household duties
in
a

manner. She was thinking how she'd have
a
maid to do
her work soon. She was picturing George's astonishment
and joy when she poured the money into his lap.

Spook Crooks!
Lola looked at her son's eyes from time to time; she
could see nothing wrong with them, but the spirits must
know better than she.
Came the hour of six on the day after the second sun
had set. Lola was waiting for the clock to strike. She
had carefully removed her dress, sitting in her under
wear so she'd waste no time getting at the handkerchief.
She had a pair of scissors in her hand. The hour struck!
Feverishly she cut the handkerchief free from her vest.
With trembling hands she pulled out the stitches that
held the ends together. She shoved her hand in the
opening. She pulled out the money. She started to count
it. There was no need.
The top bill was a twenty, underneath was a one. The
rest was blank paper.
Lola toppled to the floor in a faint.
In a few minutes she revived and rose to her feet. She
half walked, half tottered to her bedroom. There, before
an image of The Blessed Virgin, she fell in prayer and
supplication.
Dazed with the shock, broken mentally, Lola finally
took a paper bag from the table, and with a pencil
laboriously wrote :
Dearest George:
I have been false to you and my God. I went to a fortune teller
who was to double our money. I took some out of the bank. I can
not live to face you and the children, for I've spoiled their lives
and yours.
I hope to see you in Heaven.
God bless you.
Your Lola.
She had hardly finished writing when she heard
George's footsteps on the floor below. She ran to the

window, threw it open, balanced herself for a moment
on the edge, closed her eyes, shrieked, "Holy Mother,
forgive me !" and jumped.
With the ringing scream piercing his ears, George
opened the door of the apartment. Not understanding,
he looked about. He saw the note, read
it,
did not under
stand all of
it,
for Lola's tears had made the writing
partly indecipherable. He ran to the window and looked
out. The crowd below hid the figure crushed on the hard
pavement. George dashed to the street, pushed men and
women out of his way, bent over the pathetic broken
heap, clasped her to his arms, murmuring:
"My Lola —my Lola —come back to me. Speak, for
God's sake, speak
!"
A
blue uniformed officer shoved his way through the
throng, took in the scene, waved the crowd back, and
ordered
:
"Phone for an ambulance."
Lifting the grief-stricken husband, he started to lead
him away as another policeman arrived.
"Suicide," said the first officer. "Phone the station."
The next few hours passed like
a
horrible dream.
George showed the note, he knew no more. Father Kelley
came to the house to bring what comfort he could. News
paper headlines screamed:

Spook Crooks!
Dante's Inferno, Canto XX is devoted entirely to that
part of Hades which is occupied exclusively by sooth
sayers, fortune tellers and seers. Reserve another cell
there for Mrs. "Clark" or whatever her name may be
now.
* * * *
Immediately following the tragic end of this girl-
mother whose belief in spirit mediums cut short her use
ful life as mother and wife, a representative of the Press
Bureau started an investigation beyond that of the police
and city officials. Working independent of the authori
ties, but with their co-operation, starting from the cold,
stark coroner's report he ferreted out the actual methods
used by Mrs. Clark.
To start with, Mrs. Clark was not a Spiritualist, nor
did she belong to any of the ultra-creeds which are sin
cere believers in the possibility to the dead coming back
to earth. True Spiritualism is not to be confused with
the fake medium's "religion."
Spiritualism is a religion that was born in 1848 at
Hydesville, Wayne County, New York, when Kate and
Margaret Fox (known as the Fox sisters), originated
"spirit rapping." The fame of these girls spread all over
the world, and scientists came thousands of miles to in
vestigate the "spirit phenomena." The cult spread like
wildfire, but in 1888 received a great set-back when Kate
Fox confessed that the rappings came from the cracking
of her big toe.
The actual identity of Mrs. Clark is still unknown
to the police, but they found she had been operating
under an alias.
Regardless of who she
is,

lous monster with the face and form of a woman, but
the soul and mind of a vulture, was a saint compared
to her.
Here is the explanation of how this modern ogre, this
she-demon in human shape, entrapped this young woman,
and by preying on her superstitious mind, stripped her
of her religion, robbed her of her reason, stole her hard-
earned dollars, and by raising false hopes with trickery,
took away her desire to live.
Mrs. Paestro was obviously planted in the neighbor
hood by the soothsayer. These seers use 'steerers' much
as a carnival uses 'shills,' the idea of both being to bring
trade. Gambling houses use them too.
The job of the steerer in this case was to form an
acquaintance with those in the neighborhood, find out
who had some money in the bank, and, regardless of the
circumstances, tempt them with tales of what the spirits
had done for others, and what they would do for them.
Investigation in the block where Lola lived revealed
the fact that Mrs. Paestro had ensnared three other
women in the trap of the medium. At least, these three
women admitted having taken losses in their experiences
with Mrs. Clark. How many others suffered, but from
fear of their husbands' or neighbors' criticism would not
admit
it,
no one knows.
The medium, to impress Lola, first used the simplest
of tricks, effects that were done thirty years ago. The
rapping on the table was child's play, but made
a
weighty
impression on the victim's mind.
There are many ways of doing this, but from evi
dence left behind, Mrs. Clark used the easiest. Lola,
holding one of the medium's hands, thought Mrs.

Paestro was holding the other, but in the dark, Mrs.
Paestro released Mrs. Clark's hand, and the alleged
medium, using a hollow heel and hammer arrangement
with a string running up her leg attached to a garter,
with her free hand simply pulled on the string and pro
duced the raps. (Note illustration on page 156.)
It is almost impossible, in a darkened room, to tell
from which direction sound comes, particularly when the
victim is keyed up. The victim really believes the raps
came from the center of the table, as the medium says.
Beware of mediums who produce raps. There are more
than twenty ways to do the trick, and each method is
different.
The table rising effect is another old stunt. Fake me
diums use both table rapping and table lifting to im
press their "customers." It is just as easy to make a
table rise as it is to produce raps. By concealing a knife
in the sleeve of his coat, if the medium is a man, or in
the sleeves of her blouse, if a woman, it can be done.
(See illustration on page 155.)
They use either a kitchen table which does not weigh
more than a few pounds, or a card table, which is ex
ceptionally light. They slide the knife under the pro
truding edge of the table, place the tips of their fingers
on the table exactly as shown in the drawing, maneuver
the knife under the edge, and lift up the arms.
It can be done with a fork, as well as a knife, pro
vided the prongs point upwards.
Whether Mrs. Clark fooled Lola with the knife trick,
we do not know. She may have had a small nail driven in
the table and by hooking her wedding ring underneath
it,
worked the trick. There are almost as many ways to
make
a
table rise as there are to produce raps.

called by some mediums, is a pair of tweezers worked by
wires running down the shaft of the rod. The medium
picks the questions up with this rod.
In Lola's case it was not necessary for the medium to
use a reaching rod, because Mrs. Paestro, her accomplice,
working in the dark, could hand the questions to her.
She could also pass her the trumpet. If you recall, Lola
held one hand of each of the other women. One hand
free is all that a medium needs. If Mrs. Paestro hadn't
been an accomplice, by trickery Mrs. Clark could have
gotten one hand free, while Lola believed that she still
held both. But that's another story.
When Mrs. Clark received the questions from Mrs.
Paestro, in the dark, she slipped one of them into the
little wooden contrivance, the base. Refer to the drawing
on page 156 and note the battery and a small flash
light.
The medium, after the card was in the base, and the
base was fastened tightly into the end of the trumpet,
turned on the light in the base, holding her hand over
the end to keep the light from escaping until she bent
over and looked down at the illuminated card.
In Lola's case, Mrs. Clark did this four times to get
each question. That was when she was stalling for time
with her "talks to the spirits."
She then brought the trumpet up to the top of the
table again, took off and concealed the base, placed the
mouthpiece to her lips, and the other end near the ear
of the victim, and in a falsetto voice answered the ques
tions. The long metal cone of the trumpet transformed
the falsetto voice into a most ghostly one.

ever known, once surreptitiously put powderedjajnp
black on the mouthpiece of the trumpet. Imagine jhe
laughs provoked when the lights were turned on and the
medium's mouth was black !
These tricks that cost Lola her life are in daily prac
tice, and while they do not always bring death to the
victim, do cause suffering, poverty and misery.
The sewing of money into a handkerchief before a
victim's eyes is an old gypsy trick. It is known as the
'switch.' (Note the illustration on page 159.) As the
medium seemingly places the money in the handkerchief
she simply changes the bills that the victim has brought,
for the blank paper wrapped in a few genuine bills.
If you recall, in Lola's case, the medium left the room
for a few minutes. That was to give her a chance to get
paper and bills to form a package the same size as that
of Lola's money. A quick change that is absolutely un
detectable takes place, the medium sews the first few
stitches so as to conceal the blank paper which she placed
in the pocket already sewed by the dupe. Part of a gold
bill is left out.
This was just an added touch to convince the victim
that the money was in the handkerchief.
The sewing of money in Lola's vest is to prevent her
from feeling the roll and detecting the difference, if any,
and to further prove that the money is in her possession.
Obviously the setting of the 'two suns' is essential to
give the medium a chance to get the thousand dollar
bills changed before the hue and cry of the police is
heard, and to let her make her getaway.
The story about Lola's child's eyes was to distract, par
tially, her mind from the money. There was nothing the

CHAPTER VII
HOW TO BECOME A SPIRIT MEDIUM
Before the following letter and revelations were writ
ten, considerable thought was given to the subject, and
many visits made in New York £nd vicinity to so-called
'spirit mediums.' It is not the author's intention in this
book to do harm to any one, but merely to aid the credu
lous and superstitious in saving their health and money.
And it is his belief that the following letter and answer
will do so.
The letter referred to came from Indiana from a
woman in Indiana who had lost her only son. Read it :
Nov. 9, 1 93 1.
Since the death of my boy two years ago I have been looking
for solace among spirit mediums. I was born in the faith,
but did not find in it any aid at the time of my boy's death.
Accordingly I have been going regularly to spirit mediums, some
of whom call themselves spiritual mediums. None of them have
done me any good, but all have taken my money.
Can you tell me how these people "set up in the business," for
there is no other word or term for it. They pose as ministers and
yet have no education. Few speak grammatical English. None
are sincere or genuine. Yet thousands of people flock to them
regularly.
Almost all have certificates ordaining them ministers. How
are these obtained? Can anyone be a spirit or spiritual medium
by paying certain fixed fees? How does one protect oneself against
these frauds, except by staying away from them?

Please write me a detailed account of this business of being
a medium. I will pay anything in reason to relieve my mind on
the subject.
Mrs. Sarah R. M .
Following is the reply the author sent in his official
capacity as chairman of the Press Bureau of Parent As
sembly No. i, Society of American Magicians.
Nov. 14, 193 1.
Dear Madam:
Your letter is only one of many which ask approximately the
same questions. Therefore I am writing to you in detail and
making carbon copies which I will send to the other inquirers.
There is no charge for the service. As Chairman of the Press
Bureau of the Parent Assembly No. I, of the Society of American
Magicians it is my duty to give you this information without
remuneration from you, for we are trying to render a community
service.
To start with, the first move of one who wants to be a 'spirit
medium' is to become friendly with a medium who is already
accepted by some organized body.
It is easy for a medium to be a member of an organized body
as pointed out below, so it is equally easy for the prospective
medium to meet a 'recognized' one. Lessons in how to be a medium
are given by almost all mediums. These lessons are called 'develop
ment sittings.' They teach how to conduct a meeting and reveal
to the 'ambitious novitiate' lessons on how to fleece the public, if
one's taste runs to fraud.
The cost of becoming a 'recognized medium' is very modest.
One writes to The National Spiritualistic Alliance of Lake
Pleasant, Mass., one of the foremost organizations and makes
application for membership. Miss Shirley Whicher is (or was)
secretary. Anyone sending one dollar to the association becomes
an 'Individual Member,' and for two dollars this association sends
a 'medium' or 'healer's' certificate. If one desires to start a church

there is a charge of five dollars for the 'Charter,' but ten members
are necessary to obtain the 'Church Charter.'
It is a good place here to point out that not all spiritualists are
grafters or insincere. It is not the sincere and genuine mediums
that are being referred to here, only the grafters.
The new medium, having learned the ropes, is now an appli
cant for an 'Assistant Minister Certificate.' A local 'church board'
examines the applicant and after 'demonstrating' message bring
ing abilities, he (or she) is recommended to church headquarters.
The certificate received, the 'Assistant Minister' holds services as
a helper to a full 'minister.'
The next step on the road of the applicant is to apply for a
"Minister's Certificate." This is a little harder to get than the
assistant's, for ministers are entitled to perform marriage cere
monies, officiate at funerals, and generally perform all the duties
of a genuine minister. However, it is not so difficult, despite any
lack of education of the applicant.
A new application blank is filled in by the duly ordained 'as
sistant minister,' and sent to National Headquarters. A certified
'reverend' then visits the church where the applicant is giving
'readings' and watches him 'work.' If the 'reverend' is satisfied,
and believes that the applicant will make a good 'minister,' fitting
ceremonies are publicly held and the assistant is sworn in as a
full 'minister.'
The questions asked prior to granting the full minister's cer
tificate are: age, sex, nationality, how long interested in spiritual
ism, will the applicant always be a spiritualist, at all time conduct
himself honorably and never bring disgrace to the name of
minister.
Minister's certificates are never issued, according to a state
ment of a leading spiritualist, to anyone ever convicted of any
crime or fraud. However, many ask, as you did:
"Ministers of every other creed must have years of training
and study at a recognized institute. Why do spiritualists accept
any uneducated and untrained prospects who say they feel the

'call'? And how do they know the applicant has never been con
victed of a crime?"
In a pamphlet sold to the "initiated," full instructions on how to
fleece the public are given. This booklet is printed as an expose
of spiritualism and is sold as such (possibly to avoid postal authori
ties preventing its distribution), but in it is given exact instruc
tions how to avoid the police, how to advertise for 'clients,' how
to have believers sign a 'receipt' which makes the 'minister' im
mune from arrest as a fortune teller, how to work 'donation
racket,' etc., etc.
The 'donation racket' is used where fees can not be collected.
One medium uses it in this fashion. Before giving a reading, in
order to avoid the fortune telling law, he states "I charge you
nothing for the reading and advice I will give you. To take care
of my time, I request you to simply make a donation to the
church." The medium forgets to tell the sitter that he is in most
cases the "church."
In the room where mediums hold forth one often finds a large
glazed cardboard statement of the 'Declaration of the Principles
of the National Spiritualist Association.' It is most impressive
and costs but 50 cents.
In the booklet on how mediums work, details are given about
various practices of fraudulent spiritualists. The author of the
booklet, a man just recently convicted and fined $100, gives com
plete instructions on how to read messages written by believers.
While the method he gives differs from ones explained by me in
many articles, the same underlying principle is used, that of sub
stituting blank paper for the paper on which the message is
written.
Therefore, let me tell you to never write anything on paper in
a medium's meeting. No matter how innocent the moves of the
medium may be, trickery is being used to find out your question.
And the answer you get is just so much nonsense.
The medium's instruction book, for one can call it nothing
else, tells how to give "psychological readings" and states "it all
depends on the medium's ability to handle the sitter and to re

peat a stock speil." The word speil to the initiated means 'talk.'
The jargon of the author of the booklet is the jargon of the show
business.
According to the writer of the booklet, twelve divisions cover
everything in the life of the average individual. Time, personal
magnetism, investments, partnerships, best friends, obstacles, sick
ness to look out for, enemies, marriages, money conditions, change
in affairs (trips), surprises and warnings are included in the
things the fake medium must cover in his 'speil.'
The details change according to the age and sex of the dupe.
If the medium has a chance before the meeting opens to search
the pockets of overcoats, etc., left in an outside room, he may
do so, thus getting information that he later states the spirits told
him. Not all mediums do this, but some do, and have. Trickery
based on deception gives the nervy medium a chance to use 'stock
speils' to impress the credulous. No matter how uneducated one
may be, if he has a good memory he can learn by rote the proper
things to say.
Unbelievable as it may be, Harry Houdini had in his possessions
at his death hundreds of 'certificates of Ordination' issued to un
educated, ignorant people who become 'ministers' almost for the
asking. Some of these certificates were issued by the National
Spiritualistic Alliance and others by the National Spiritualistic
Association of Washington, D.C. One of the latter organization's
certificates is reproduced herewith on page 165.
In company with friends (and strangers taken along as wit
nesses), I have gone to several spiritual mediums in New York
and vicinity to check up stories I have been told. As all the experi
ences have been practically the same at each meeting, I will relate
exactly what happened on one night only (September 23, 1931)
when we visited a 'reading medium' on 58th Street, New York.
Those in the party were Bob, Margaret, Bessie, Edna, Ernest
and myself. We were not asked for money but a 'donation' of a
'silver offering* of fifty cents was paid. The assistant to the medium
collected from those in the room, about 20 people, some articles

'the personal magnetism of which will bring vibrations that will
aid the spirits in guiding the medium in the answers,' she said.
Here is what happened : after some religious hymns were played
on a loud and noisy phonograph.
The medium picked up Bob's pencil. He sensed that Bob was
in trouble about a 'Building condition, a real estate deal.' He gave
ten minutes' advice on how to handle the situation. Bob is in the
advertising business and never was connected with any real estate
firm or deal.
Margaret gave her compact. From this the medium received
an impression from the spirits that she had been in a lot of trouble
and gone through much unhappiness in the last two years. He gave
advice on how to combat her difficulties. Margaret had been
married for little more than two years, and had spent the hap
piest days of her life in that time.
From Bessie's keys the medium received the impression she
owned an automobile. He also declared the spirits told him she
was headstrong. Bessie's keys contained one marked 'Ford.' He
saw the car name. Obviously she had a car. She is the best natured
woman imaginable, yet the spirits told him she was headstrong,
he said.
Edna's cigarette case gave the medium, through the spirits, the
idea that Edna was going to be married shortly. He gave advice
on that 'condition.' He explained the man of her choice would
ask her to wed him soon. Edna has been married more than 15
years.
From Ernest's fountain pen the medium saw a "condition of
uniforms. Men marching." He also received an impression of "some
one in spirit who loves you." Ernest hasn't lost anyone in his
family. Yet look at the psychology of the medium. Almost every
one has lost some dear and near one. He just picked the wrong
one to deliver the message "from the one in spirit."
I have written these statements of the medium exactly as he
gave them, and have gone to this length merely to impress on you
the stupidity of the statements of the average medium.
Out of a lots of ramblings about "organisms and psychic im

pressions of spirit conditions" any medium may make some state
ment that, while applied generally, hits most of us many times.
"Lucky statements," so impress some dupes that they believe the
faker really has some supernatural power. Out of our party, not
one statement was correct, yet one woman present, whom the
medium told the spirits said her mother would die soon, broke
into hysterical tears.
There is no question but that many mediums are sincere and
believe themselves gifted with genuine psychic powers. The writer
as an associate member of the American Society for Psychical
Research reads the journal of that society, "Psychic Research,"
carefully.
In this there appear regularly cases that are reported of genuine
phenomena, yet these reported cases are in such minority as com
pared with the hundreds of thousands of "spirit messages" that
before you accept as genuine any statements of any medium it is
wise to check up on the medium's standing with approved psychic
research investigators.
In releasing the above letter to the mother in Indiana
for publication it is the sincere hope of the writer that
making public the method of becoming a 'minister' will
cause all Spiritualist Associations to 'clean house' and
stop the frauds being perpetrated in the name of religion,
and thus protect the sincere mediums who never tell
fortunes, sell oil stocks or predict the future.
In closing this chapter, as further proof that "gross
fraud" is prevalent among spirit mediums I want to re
produce here (in part) a letter to Harry Houdini from
the late Dr. A. M. Wilson of Kansas City, Editor and
Publisher of The Sphinx for more than a score of years.

and official organ of the Society of American Magicians,

letter :—
1007 Main St.,
Kansas City, Mo.
Dear Houdini:
For almost 61 years I have been witnessing and investigating
Spiritualism as propagated by mediums through their so-called
communications with the dead. Up to this time, I have never
met a medium, celebrated or obscure, who was not a gross fraud,
nor seen a manifestation that was not trickery and that could not
be duplicated by any expert magician.
The thing that first aroused my suspicions and disbeliefs and
started me thinking and investigating was why could not the dear
departed communicate direct with their relatives and friends?
Why talk, rap, write or materialize through a medium, the ma
jority of whom are ignorant men and women, although shrewd
and cunning?
I have never met a medium who was not a fraud or seen a ma
terialization of any kind that was not fraudulent.

CHAPTER VIII
FLICKER QUEEN FRAUD
Tinga-linc-TING. The telephone was ringing, but in
stead of the usual harsh notes of alarm, the softest of
peals, gently calling, filled the room.
Miss X, the pride of Hollywood, princess of the films,
rubbed her eyes, stirred half awake, rang for Celeste,
her French maid, pouted prettily, flounced deeper under
the flimsy covers and commanded:
"I don't care who it is. I won't come to the phone."
Celeste, trained to the impetuous ways of the film
star, asked,
"Even if it's the studio, Mam'selle ?"
"No one, I said. Hurry up and shut the darn thing
off."
Celeste picked up the French phone hidden behind
an adorable doll dressed as "Fifi," which looked exactly
like Miss X had looked in that part in "Waif of the
World," the talkie which had first brought her fame.
" 'Alio. Yes. No, she can not be disturbed. No. Who?
Messtaire Ali? Oui. Wait. I do not know."
She hardly had chance to turn before Miss X, a dash
ing, alluring bit of femininity in filmy robe de nuit
direct from the Boulevard des Artistes of Paris roughly
snatched the phone from her hand.
"Stupid," she thundered. "It is the fortune teller."
"But, mam'selle said
"
"I didn't mean him!"

"Hello," purred the star sweetly into the phone. "Oh,
yes, of course. Celeste has no brains. I'm never out to
you. Really? Certainly, I've a new slate, I'll bring that.
Yes ? That is just wonderful. I'll try. I'm due on location
at ten this morning. Yes, I know it's nine now. Oh, bother
the location. I'll be with you in less than an hour. Bye !"
Turning to Celeste through whose brain was running
thoughts not so complimentary to the sweetheart of the
world, the pampered pet ordered:
"Run my bath. Not too warm. Use those new violet
bath salts. Hurry, hurry. Mula Ali has some special news
for me."
As Celeste moved to obey, Miss X threw off her only
covering, moved to a full length mirror and admired her
self. She was beautifully formed, and she knew it. As
she pirouetted in front of the mirror, she thought of what
to tell R , the famous director brought from Ger
many just to direct her in her new picture, "Sweetheart
of the Army." This director was unlike those she had
in the past. This man meant business. When he said
"Ten" he meant ten, and that was the time of the call
this morning. There was no pouting and vamping with
him. Mentally she called him "The Beast."
She couldn't plead illness. R was too smart for
that. She couldn't pretend to have misunderstood the
time. Oh, what could she tell him. She couldn't stay away
from the soothsayer. Oh, what could she do. Celeste in
terrupted her thoughts by announcing that the tub was
ready, so giving up wondering Miss X wandered into
her bath room. What a room. Inverted hidden lights.
Huge mirrors from floor to ceiling on every hand. Sunken
in marble below the floor level, in the center of the
room, was a bath that put to shame the most luxurious

creation of the Romanus sovereign after which it had
been modeled. Concealed showers. Three inch thick
rugs. What's the use of describing it? It was splendor
itself.
Celeste handed the star the prerequisites of the bath
and was about to leave the room when inspiration hit
the favorite of the flickers.
"Dear," she cooed. "Phone Mr. R—i— at the studio.
Say that my car hit another and that I'm being detained
until police straighten everything out."
Whoever wrote "Singing in the Bath Tub" certainly
must have first heard Miss X in her bath, for she warbled
and shouted bits of everything she'd ever heard. She was
certainly in good mood. Her ablutions finished she ran
back to her dressing room, with the aid of Celeste
dressed happily, called for her car and chauffeur, picked
up a new slate she'd bought only yesterday, and soon was
en route to the seer. If the drivers for Hollywood stars
told all they knew, meteors wouldn't fall quicker than
the human satellites.
Arriving at the fortune teller's, Miss X alighted from
her car, noted the dignified sign that announced:
MULA ALI
OCCULTIST— CONSULTANT
MYSTIC SLATE WRITING
She rang the bell and was ushered in by a dusky Negro
gaudily attired in a red sash and loosely wound turban.
As he salaamed before Miss X he pulled back a set of
heavy curtains made of shining black and silver brocade,
and invited her to enter a large room. Soft tinkling, like
temple bells from the hills of the Afghan country,
greeted her as she stepped across the threshold.

No matter how often Miss X, accustomed as she was
to the bizarre, saw this room she never was quite able
to overcome a mysterious fear of the unknown. On the
left of the room was the huge, strange, and grotesque
figure of a half-man, half-beast. With out-stretched arms
it held aloft a metal circle on which were engraved the
signs of the Zodiac.
Overhead the ceiling of brightly pigmented plaster
was covered with geometric designs. On the small table
near the window were two burners of incense. Drifting
smoke carried the odd, exotic odor of burning spices.
Directly opposite the table was a glass vial from which
drops of perfume fell intermittently.
The walls were hand-painted. There were huge planets
surrounded with small stars; animals, and queer shapes
designating the twelve lunar months; nudes of men and
women, fantastic and unconventional.
Miss X took her accustomed seat at one of the two
chairs at the table, and was hardly seated when Mula
AH entered. The soothsayer, who was known to all
Hollywood as a student of the Yogi mysteries, explained
his early morning phone call.
"Miss X, the Jinni of Personal Opulence came to me
last night with a special message that wealth was in
the offing for some one of my favored clients. I have no
idea just what he had in mind. All that he told me was
that he would bring word himself this morning to any
believer in the Occult Omnipresent I selected. That is
why I told you to bring your own slate, for we shall have
a spirit writing test."
He looked at Miss X with an air of humility and piety,
though his dark eyes seemed to pierce her very brain.
His hawk-like, jutting jaw set off thin lips that seemed

to have a perpetual sneer, and to any but a fascinated,
blind woman he would have seemed sinister. Despite the
attitude of humbleness, an invisible, evil witchery seemed
to surround him.
When Ali first came to Hollywood he had announced
that he was of the tribe of the Afghan Benneli, fighting
warriors of the East, but that he was not a warrior, for
he came of a family long known as mighty witch doc
tors, and that by tribal law, he must always be one. His
dark skin and black hair attracted to his doors the femi
nine stars of the city of films, and the miraculous things
he did in the name of the eastern magi gods spread his
fame throughout all California.
"Miss X," the soothsayer continued, "the slate that
you have brought me is new, not so ? No hands, human or
otherwise, have ever written upon
it,
correct? Good!
It
seems that this message today must be delivered under
regular test conditions. By that

No matter how often Miss
X
came to Mula Ali, she
could never suppress

shiver of apprehension.
She took the slate she had brought, and placed
it
on
the floor with the chalk between the feet of the sooth
sayer and herself, exactly as she had been directed. She

Semitic in shape, were almost covered with long lids

the room was noiseless, for they were in their bare feet,
with toes hennaed and colored. Of clothes, there were
few. A glittering beaded shield over each breast, a loin
cloth of scarlet fabric was all they wore, except from
ankle to knee, and from wrist to elbow, bracelets of hand-
hammered gold supported stones of emerald, ruby and
sapphire hues. And suspended over the stomach of each
was a curved snake of jade.
Much as a muezzin calls the faithful to prayer, Mula
Ali started to chant:
"Allah, il Allah. The Jinni of Gold has spoken to me.
As I place my hands thus on the palms of this girl of the
Western World, let my handmaidens begin to play the
music of the East, and please send thou thy servant with
his word."
As Ali stopped talking, the girls raised their reeds to
their lips and started playing. Weird barbaric strains
poured forth. Miss X shuddered. Her grasp bit deeper
and deeper into Ali's fingers as they sat with hands
clasped in the fashion of an Oriental seer and his client.
Ali muttered in his native language swaying back and
forth in his chair. Suddenly with a cry, he turned to the
players, and commanded :
"Get you gone. There is no place for you in my pres
ence."
When they had left the room, Ali unclasped Miss X's
firm grip, told her to pick up the slate and see if the
Jinni had brought a message.
Miss X bent to the floor, picked up the slate, and
lol where a few minutes before there had been nothing

and sprawling letters, there appeared :

A special message had come from the gods for her!
But what did it mean? She could hot tell. Turning to
Ali she asked:
"Do you understand this?"
He hesitated. "I do and I don't," he replied finally.
"I believe it better, however, to ask for further instruc
tions."
He picked up the slate, studied the message, and sug
gested to his client that she keep her eyes on it a second
while he left the room for a drink of water.
Miss X sat motionless at the table awaiting the re
turn of the seer. Her vivid imagination pictured the sor
cery of the Orient, where great dacoits came to her with
their huge hairy arms full of jewels and gold. She had
visions of marvelous adventures in which she was spend
ing with prodigal abandon.
The rustle of Ali's flowing garments disturbed her
thoughts. She looked at him, noted that he had donned
the turban that signified that he had made a pilgrimage
to Mecca, and was wearing a burnoose of fine broadcloth
instead of the flowing robes he wore when he first greeted
her.
"My pupil," he commenced, "I am ready to ask Allah's
blessing on this which we are about to do. Since the great
Jinni of Opulence wrote on the slate which you brought
to him a message that is vague to us, and we can not
ask him more particulars today as he has gone back to

his rest in the clouds beyond the horizon, we must seek
information elsewhere.
"Therefore, when Allah grants us permission to pro
ceed we will summon again our musicians of the East,
and while they play to the great Hashim, ruler of the
Spirits who govern the actions of mankind, we will ask
him to send us a message which explains exactly what
the Jinni meant when he wrote, 'Wealth is in Rangoon
mining.'
"Let us proceed. Allah, most powerful, in whose hands
are the destinies of the world, hear my prayer. The voice
of India calls to you from America, asking that you send
spirits to aid us.
"We acknowledge that we mortals are but as dirt
under thy feet. Therefore, in this spirit of humility, we
come to you asking that you send those hidden forces
to our assistance."
He paused for breath, rang for the musicians, and
when they started playing, picked up the slate on which
was written on one side the cryptic message. The other
was blank. He held the slate on a level with Miss X's
eyes, moaned, shuddered, and then was still.
He sat motionless, hands and head fixed as though
in death. The fire of life seemed gone, but his eyes
showed a strange power.
Miss X's pulse raced, her breath came faster. Her face
lost color until she, too, was the color of death. Her
eyes never left Ali's. It was a terrible strain. She felt
no relief even when AH finally laid down the slate, mo
tioned the musicians away, rolled up his sleeves, care
lessly showed his hands were empty and said:
"It is over, Miss X. The spirits have come and
brought us a message. Let us read it together.

"'RANGOON MINING IS SOLD BY
CERTAIN STOCKBROKERS*
"Ah, I perceive. You are supposed to buy some of this
stock. Very good. I will investigate it for you and find
out which brokers are selling it. Then we will have an
other meeting and I will get further instructions for
you."
Ali rose, bowed to Miss X, and escorted her to the
door. She signed to her driver to bring her car, and
ordered him to drive to the "lot" where her company
was on location. Her mind was whirling, her thoughts on
the mine in which she would make so much money.
It was eleven-fifteen by the clock in her car when she
drove up to the tented city. Impetuously she strode to
her dressing tent, followed by her chauffeur who carried
her "make-up" materials in a gorgeous lizard-covered
case. Celeste met her at the entrance, told the driver
to inform R that the star had arrived, and started
to help her mistress to undress.
"Mam'selle," Celeste said, "that man, R , is hor
rible. He have raved and stormed about here that you
are no good actress and that when your contract was up
he will no more have you about. Oui, mam'selle, the in
sults, the threats. Oh, it is horrible, quite horrible."
Suddenly a loud voice broke in:
"Is that person not ready yet? Let me see her."
R stamped into the tent.
The fact that Miss X was in a thin dressing gown,
and at the top could be seen the delicate lingerie worn
by this darling of the screen, meant nothing to him, for
he was the artist director, not a man when he was on
location.

"Miss," he stated, shaking a finger at Miss X, "you
have this whole company kept idle again for one hour
and one-half of one. There are two hundred people who
nothing do while you lie to me your car is broken, and
what money that it costs this company. That means
nothing to you. I would not have you work for me again,
I will "
Miss X broke in, with her nerves tingling yet from
her experience with the fortune teller:
"Get out of here," she screamed. "How dare you in
trude when I am not dressed? How dare you say I lied
about my car being broken? How dare you?"
With flashing eyes the temperamental star battled
the prosaic German whose idea of the motion picture
business was to produce masterpieces at a reasonable
figure. Hotter and hotter words passed between them,
each one hurling vituperation and abuse at each other
shamefully, the director knowing he was right, and the
star knowing she was wrong, but taking the attitude that
a "Queen" can do no wrong.
It finally ended. R left the tent in a blind rage
and Miss X followed shortly afterward in just as bad
a temper. Work on the picture started, but neither star
nor director was in humor to do justice to the work.
When luncheon was finally served Miss X ate in her tent
and R refused to eat at all. The morale of the
entire company suffered, but when a girl who once thought
fifteen dollars was a lot of money suddenly finds four
thousand dollars a week in her envelope, her judgment
as well as her ego is warped.
Work on the picture continued after the noon bit, but
a certain spark was lacking. When the sun went down at
four o'clock R drove to Hollywood to explain to

the president of the company what was happening, while
Miss X went home to sulk and build castles in the air
out of the Rangoon mine millions. First, she thought,
she would buy the company, then discharge its president,
and then—her dainty lips curled—she would fire R .
Miss X's humor when she arrived back at her Bev
erly Hills estate was not one with which to tamper. She
raged at Celeste, told her secretary that she was
"through," when that most efficient young lady told her
to "Keep away from that fortune teller before he takes
you like Grant took Richmond," discharged her famous
French chef, who was also Celeste's beau, and generally
upset her household as no one can except a spoiled movie
queen.
M , her leading man in many of her successes,
came, by appointment, for supper, but Miss X wouldn't
even see him. The phone rang several times, but Celeste
each time stated "Mam'selle is not at home." Miss X
walked the floor, a lioness tramping back and forth in
her rage.
"Why, oh, why doesn't Ali call?" she kept muttering
to herself.
Celeste, half torn between loyalty to the star, and
anger because of the unjust dismissal of her sweetheart,
the chef, cursed the fortune teller.
"Why does mam'selle, with all her money, want
more?" she thought. "She has all she can use. I could
understand her if she went to a fortune teller about her
lover, but money, poof!"
The soft tinkle of the boudoir phone. Celeste dashed
to answer it.
"Out, out," she almost shouted, "Mam'selle awaits."
Miss X snatched the phone.

"Yes—yes?" she demanded. "What did you learn?
Yes? That's great. Why do you want to see me tonight?
Oh, I see. You want me to consult the slates again be
fore I buy that stock. Is it necessary? Oh, surely, I'll be
right over. . . .
"My hat, Celeste, and the car. Quickly ! Wait a minute 1
Tell Henri not to leave. I think he is a wonderful chef.
Tell him his salary is fifty dollars a month more. Run
along now and don't wait up for me. I'm not so bad now,
am I?"
The run from Miss X's miniature mansion in Beverly
Hills to the salon on Hollywood Boulevard which housed
the seer of the Orient should have taken fifteen minutes.
Miss X made it in eight.
Mula Ali greeted her in his usual calm manner, bowed
low, took her slate, and beckoned her to a lounge. She
had always sat at the table, but this time it seemed the
seer wished her to sit beside him. There was an odor
of smoldering incense about him.
"My friend," he started, "I have all the particulars
of where you may buy the stock of Rangoon Mining, Ltd.
It is sold in San Francisco by a very reputable firm. Its
price is in English pounds. The broker who is selling it
is very certain that there is some fast upward move com

other foreigner has ever seen either, until I show them
to you now, tonight. I would not do this, even for you,
but your overwhelming beauty affects even I, who am be
yond the mortal.
"The first test is one in which you take a piece of
paper, simply write your name at the top, and place it
yourself in an empty bottle. In four minutes' time, while
we pray, some word will come to you from Shaitan, in
writing, on the paper on which you signed your name.
Let us first proceed to that test."
Clapping his hands to summon his assistant, Ali com
manded that an empty bottle, any kind, he said, be
brought to him. He also asked for an ordinary writing
pad and pencil.
When these were brought he tore off the top sheet,
handed it to Miss X, asked her, while his back was
turned, to pull her dresses above her knees, place the
paper on the warm flesh of her leg and write her name
across the top of the paper. He walked across the room
while Miss X did as she was told.
Then he returned, took the empty bottle that he had
placed on the floor, and asked Miss X to roll the paper
so that it would fit in the neck of the bottle. When she
had done this he uncorked the bottle and let Miss X her
self slide the paper inside it.
He corked the bottle again, with the white paper
plainly visible inside, and asked Miss X to hold the bottle
in her hands, close to her heart, then he started to chant :
"In Rangoon, in Kashmir, in Delhi, in Bombay,
throughout the length and breadth of the land that Allah
loves there are the Spirits of the bad, and the Spirits of
the good. Here in this humble abode of this Witch

Doctor of the East there is a maiden young and fair to
see. That which is in her mind is sorely tried with won
ders. Could it not be that the Spirits of Allah or the
Spirits of Shaitan will come to her and ease her prob
lems by telling her what to do. . . ."
For fully four minutes Ali kept up his chant. Miss X
hugged the bottle closer and closer to her, as though in
fear it would vanish. Her eyes never left the paper. It
seemed to her that vapor was rising from it. When Ali
stopped his intonation and took the bottle from her, she
leaned over on the couch, and unconsciously circled his
left arm with her right. Many a millionaire would have
exchanged a diamond bracelet for such intimacy, but
the seer paid no attention.
Ali uncorked the bottle, holding the open end toward
him. He slowly withdrew the piece of paper. Shak
ing it in the air a few times, he finally brought it to
his lips, kissed
it,
placed
it
on each temple, and then
handed
it
to Miss
X
telling her to do what he had done,
explaining these moves as the "blessing of Allah or the

" 'Fear not to invest in the Rangoon mines which are
in the country that believes in my Master. Rather, rejoice
you, that of all the unbelievers the generous God, Allah,
has selected you to become wealthy beyond your dreams.
Your form and face are worthy of a place with the houris
of the heaven, and for this and because of the wish of
our apostle in your land, Mula Ali, may his time be long
in your world, the Great Compassionate has given you
the knowledge to acquire these great riches. Peace unto
thee.'
"
"It is a miracle !" she cried. "This blank piece of paper
was actually written upon by the gods. I will buy all those
shares. Now. Phone the broker. Immediately!"
Miss X was again the commanding, impetuous mistress
of all she surveyed. But Ali remained calm.
"My dear pupil, be calm," he remarked, as though he
were not interested in this flight of his visitor. "There is
still one more test and it must be gone through. That
is the test of 'The High Priests of the Wizards.' I told
you to bring your slate so that you might go through this
test. Unless it is answered as I wish, I will not let you
buy this stock."
Miss X commanded the seer:
"Then by all means let us go through with it."
Arising from the comfortable lounge, he bowed her to
the table.
"I will move away, Miss X," Ali stated. "When my
back is turned, I wish you to write anything on your slate
that you care to. However, it must be nothing about the
mine or money. Any question, love, health or future will
do. It simply is the final test to see if the Spirits are
entirely with us."

He left the table, turning his back. Miss X picked up
the chalk, shielded her hand as she wrote, and then
called Ali back.
"Before I return," he said, "place the writing side
down on the table, so that neither you nor I can see it.
Then I shall resume my seat."
When Miss X had complied with the request, and
the writing on the slate was face down on the table, the
seer took his customary seat facing her. He moved the
slate about with his finger tips for a second, then ordered
Miss X to place her hands on top of his, which rested
on the slate. They stayed in this position for a moment,
when Ali lifted his hands and told Miss X to place his
hands on the slate, under the cloth and out of sight.
He then told Miss X to stand behind his chair, and
place one of her hands on each of his elbows. They would
see if the spirits would answer the question. They were
in this position for quite some time when Ali asked
Miss X if she had felt his hands move. Upon receiving a
negative answer, he lifted up the cloth, and, showing
his hands bare of chalk, pointed to the writing on the
slate.
"Does this answer your question?" he asked, as he
carelessly threw the cloth on the floor.
On the slate was written without punctuation :
"You will get your wish
R will be sent home in disgrace"
Miss X picked up the slate, turned it over, showed Ali
the question.
"Will a certain director
Outlive me in pictures?"
She cried, "It does answer my question ! You surely are
a wonder!"

Some conversation about how Miss X was to bring
the cash in the morning after the banks opened concluded
the talk, and the movie queen went home after paying
a bill that Ali rendered for six visits at one hundred dol
lars a call, or six hundred dollars in all.
* * * *
Early the following morning, Miss X was at the
Hollywood National bank. She presented a check for ten
thousand dollars, and asked for it in fifty dollar bills.
The paying teller, noting that her account was over
drawn, called one of the senior vice-presidents who ex
plained carefully that her balance was only four thou
sand dollars.
Miss X fumed and stormed, but it did her no good.
Suddenly she had an inspiration.
"I paid one hundred and ten thousand dollars for my
house," she said, "I owe only sixty thousand dollars.
Will you lend me ten thousand dollars more on it?"
This was agreed upon, the papers drawn up, and
Miss X received the cash requested. No matter how
many questions the bank official asked, Miss X refused
to tell the reason for the loan in that amount.
Packing the bills in a suitcase, she drove to Mula Ali's
and without ceremony delivered the cash to the seer.
From there she drove to the studio, happy, without
a worry on her mind except how quickly she would make
enough money to buy the whole movie company.
She walked directly to the office of the president, a
cloak and suit maker who had gone into the movies with
a prayer and a shoe string, and in a few short years had
made millions.
She was about to go through the swinging gates lead

ing to the portals of the inner sanctum when the secre
tary stopped her.
"I am sorry, Miss X," she said, "but the president is
engaged with Mr. R and said he wasn't to be dis
turbed."
"Oh, that's all right," Miss X replied. "He didn't
mean me." She flounced through the gates and into the
private office.
The president, in his shirt sleeves, had his feet high
on the desk, while R was running up and down the
room, shouting, "I won't have her. I won't have her."
Both men saw Miss X at the same time. The presi
dent's face reddened, but R rushed toward her.
"I won't have you any longer," he stormed. "You get
out or I do."
Miss X ignored him. Turning to the president, she
purred :
"Will, dear, what is this loud man talking about?"
The president got up, shook hands with his favorite
star, who had brought him so much money, escorted her
to a chair and explained:
"R says that since this picture started three weeks
ago he has made less than a thousand feet of film. The
salaries and expenses on the picture are nearly thirty
thousand dollars and there is nothing to show for it. He
says that this is all your fault, that you are always late,
will not work unless you like, and that you generally
wreck the morale of the company.
"I hate to talk to you like this, but I am afraid that
I will have to ask you for your resignation. I will pay
you in full for the rest of your contract of eleven weeks,
or forty-four thousand dollars in all, and we will stay
good friends, but you will have to leave our company."

The shock took Miss X off her feet. It couldn't be
possible. Yet, what did she care ? Soon she would buy the
whole company and fire the whole lot of so and so's.
With the regal air of a queen, she said:
"Quite all right, old chap. Give me my check and I'll
be glad to quit. I really came here today to say that I
wouldn't work with R any more, anyway. Get me
my check."
The president tried to say a few words, but Miss X
would not listen. What the president had really been
trying to do was frighten his star. And now it was too
late to retreat. The secretary brought in a check as
directed, and Miss X folded it nonchalantly, placed it
in her purse, and strolled out.
She went to the bank and deposited the check. Outside
she saw L , star of another company. She crossed
to her, shook hands, kissed her rival, and chatted of old
times when they both had worked at Universal.
L was not on location, and the girls drove off
together. Miss X invited L to her house for lunch
eon, and en route told her of her fight with R •
L explained that she was in trouble at her studio
for the same reason, but that she didn't care for soon
she would be rich beyond her wildest dreams.
By the time they arrived at Miss X's home both girls
were wondering what was on the other's mind. Going
to Miss X's boudoir to wash for luncheon, L saw
the slate. She picked it up.
"Have you been going to Ali's too?" she asked.
"Yes. Why?"
"So have I and only yesterday he told me of a cer
tain stock that will make me a fortune. I can't tell you its

"What!" cried Miss X. "So did I. The name of the
stock I bought is Rangoon

"That is what he sold me. Did he use some slates
and a bottle and

"Yes," screamed Miss X. "I thought he was doing
it only for me. I believed he was a wizard. I would have
done anything he told me. Call the cops!"
"Wait. Let's phone some others."
L and Miss X unearthed three more stars who
had given Ali between three thousand dollars and seven
thousand dollars, whatever the screen stars could scrape
together. The girls called a meeting at once to decide
what action they could take. Now fully convinced Ali was
a fake, Miss X, out of a job, and L skating on thin
ice, were beginning to worry for the first time in many
years.
Miss X phoned to the president of the company. At
first he refused to speak to her, but finally, after she
had persuaded his secretary it was a case of "life or
death" he came to the phone.
"Will, dear," Miss X started, "I am in terrible

sand dollars, and we don't know what to do !"
Finally the president consented to meet Miss X and
the various stars she named in the office of his lawyer.
When the girls arrived, half the big film men in Holly
wood were there. Detailed explaining. Publicity was
feared, so local police were not notified. Private detect
ives called in, a mad dash to Ali's house on Hollywood
Boulevard where the doors were found locked.

By use of picklocks the private police were soon in
the house. They found the main studio bare except for
a small table. Pinned on this was a note reading:
THANKS FOR THE EASY MONEY
There is no use looking for me. I have washed off the fruit
stains that gave the Hindu skin effect. I couldn't get a job in
Hollywood as an actor, and as I felt the movies owed me a living,
I got it being an actor who directed his own part. My love to
the girls.
MULA ALI, ex-seer.
The conclave of stars and magnates and police de
parted. Hours of talk with attorneys and press agents
ended with the decision that nothing be told of this to
the outside world. Hence no publicity featured this
meeting.
Miss X apologized to R , was restored to the
good graces of her company and turned out the finest
picture she had ever made. The ten thousand dollars
she had lost were made up by the president, because he
thought it cheap at any price to have his best box office
attraction settle down as Miss X did and work as she
never had before.
* * * * .
This upheaval in filmland took place two years ago.
Afterward many of the leading studios banded together
to rid Hollywood of every seer in that city.
From time to time such drives have taken place,
and at this writing, city police of both the city of the
Angels and Hollywood are making an intensive drive
against fortune tellers whether they be astrologers, fake
mediums, numerologists who forecast, or just plain palm
ists, although results seem to be negligible.

But to return to Miss X. The impetuous, improvident
actress, whether screen or stage favorite, finds in the
weird, a surcease for tired and jaded nerves —and inci
dentally relief in day dreaming of fortunes to be made.
The studio of "Ali" (this is an actual description of
a studio on Hollywood Boulevard that was raided) was
designed to attract young women of Miss X's type. The
incense and the atmosphere of the Orient holds allure
for the young girl.
The stand-off-ish attitude of the seer further attracts
her, for every man she meets throws himself at her feet.
Thus, by the soothsayer's refusal to recognize her femi
nine charms, he arouses her curiosity. Once that is done,
the rest is easy.
However, even though Ali had not tried to prove the
theory that that which repels attracts, his first slate writ
ing performance was worthy of belief even by a smarter
and shrewder woman than Miss X, for it is one of the
favorite "convincers" of fake mediums, who under the
guise of religion, defraud the credulous.
Note the illustration on page 191. Simple, not so?
The seer simply wears slippers that are too large for
him, slips one off, picks up the chalk between his big toe
and the second, and writes.
The only hard part is the hours of arduous practice
necessary before writing this way becomes legible. The
late Harry Houdini, most famous magician the world
has ever known, and former president of the Society of
American Magicians, shortly before his death went to
police headquarters in New York, and while surrounded
by the most astute detectives, did this stunt.
The second impressive act Ali performed for Miss X
was one that also requires practice.

Note the second illustration on page 191. Attached
to an elastic which is pinned to the seer's shirt just be
low the elbow is a small piece of metal, curved to fit the
first or second finger. Tightly wedged in this holder is
an ordinary piece of chalk.
As the slate is held visible before the dupe's eyes, the
fortune teller writes. As soon as he finishes writing he
releases the attachment holding the chalk and the elastic
pulls it up his sleeve.
In the story of Miss X, note that he rolled up his
sleeves. That was done for two reasons; first to show
that his hands were empty, if she suspected anything, and
secondly to so wedge the apparatus above his wrist that
there was no chance of its falling down.
The music that was played while Ali did both the foot
and finger writing effect was to kill or deaden the sound
of the scratching chalk. Sometimes the seer talks loudly
for exactly the same reason.
The Test of Shaitan is one of the oldest resorts of
frauds who pose as readers of the future. You can do
this trick without a moment's practice.
Take an old bottle that has a tight-fitting cork. Wash
it out thoroughly and wipe it dry. Fill it with ordinary
household ammonia. Let it stand for a few minutes, then
pour out the liquid and cork tightly to keep the fumes
in the bottle.
Next take an ordinary piece of paper and with a steel
pen dipped in a weak solution of copper sulphate
(obtainable at any drug store) write anything you wish.
Then let it dry. The writing is now invisible.
The next move is to have some friend that you wish
to impress write his or her name or initial on the top

some night, but if you do be sure and tell your audience
it is for entertainment purposes only.
The last and most impressive trick that Ali did is the
most costly to build, but is in common use throughout
the country today. As words cannot describe the table
properly, study the diagram on page 193 carefully and
read the complete description of the parts.
This mirror arrangement is unfailing and absolutely
defies detection. As the victim of the seer places the slate
face downward on the table the seer maneuvers it about
until it is exactly in line with a marked point.
When it is in this place he pulls back the panel or flap
which covers the top mirror. Note how the second mirror
reverses the writing to make it read correctly.
If the same brains which devised this apparatus were
used properly, think of the fortune in a legitimate field
that would have awaited their possessor, but unfortu
nately he died penniless and deserted in 1906.
These four tricks exposed here are not in any way
part of a magician's stock in trade. A magician fools
you by sleight-of-hand, misdirection and a general knowl
edge of his art that only comes through years of study.
He is supposed to trick you, and he does, but always
on a fully lighted stage, not in a dark, mysterious, weird-
looking room designed to deceive and to defraud you.
The monetary loss to Miss X meant little, but the
terrific strain on her mind and health might have spelled
ultimate ruin. As this is being written I have before me
a complete case history of an ex-star of the films who is
now glad to play extra parts at any price —and belief
in fortune tellers is the reason for her downfall.

CHAPTER IX
FIRE EATING
AND OTHER FRAUDS
There is a man in prison near New York doing a
"natural." Under the laws of the State in which he was
sentenced, a life term may be only twenty years, and
this chap has done twelve years already. He is in under
the name of Harry Johnson, but that isn't his name. He
has been questioned by experts, but from his answers all
any one knows is reflected on his record card :
Name of prisoner: Harry Johnson.
Former address: Traveled with show. No permanent address.
Occupation: Fire eater.
Age: 47-
Previous Convictions : None admitted. Occupation has so burned
whorls that present finger prints can not be traced.
Offense: Murder, 2nd degree.
Nearest relative: None admitted.
There is a lot more on the card, but it doesn't mean
a thing. Johnson isn't the talking kind. That
is,
about
himself. He'll chat away
in
every spare moment about
fortune telling, the carnival or the circus side of show
business, but when the talks turn to his family, he gives
a
wonderful imitation of
a
clam.
Prison psychiatrists haven't quite figured him out.
When he
is
in
repose, his English
is
almost equal to
a
college graduate, but when he

the slang and jargon of the carnival is his language. His
knowledge of chemicals is uncanny, but the prison rules
forbid a murderer to work in the laboratory.
Here is the letter; no changes having been made in the
tense which varies in almost every paragraph, contra
dicting, yet verifying, the prison authorities' story about
the man's education.
"I read in the prison library where another drive against fake
spirit mediums and fortune tellers was under way. Good for you.
"I just had to write this letter when I read of the work you're
doing. If I had been true to my original ambitions of going on
the stage as a magician I wouldn't be here now. I'm writing this
at all odd hours. You don't get much time for letter writing here,
so while I put the date July 22nd on
it,
I
don't know when
it
will
be finished.
"I was pretty good with my hands and was doing some card
magic at
a
cheap stage back in 1912 when somebody in the au
dience asked me
if
I
was
a
professional magician.
I
told him no,
but hoped to be some day.

to his hotel with him.

said he was "Swami Hahmi" and worked fairs, carnivals, circus
side shows, fortune telling schemes and hundreds of other allied
stunts.
"He did some billet reading and some switches that had me
crazy, and then fairly hypnotized me with fire eating effects. He
was good. He said he was looking for an assistant to do the fire
eating end of his shows who knew a little magic and
I
could have
the job.
"My hair stood on end. ME do fire eating.
I
would have taken
the job for nothing. Youth
is
so impetuous.

my folks of my great luck. They cautioned me to go slow, but all

home under a sort of cloud. No one of my name had ever been
other than a business man or banker.
"Pardon me if I transgress, but this is the first time I've ever
put my thoughts down on paper and it seems good to be able to
write a letter to people who'll understand. The carnival and side
show people I knew, I've never gotten in touch with since I've
been in here. I'm through with them and that life forever. Maybe
when I get out of here, you'll give me a job helping run down
the fortune tellers, and the phoney swamis who hook young boys
and give them a "chance." A "chance" that eventually will land
them in jail.
"My writing you is to tell you about the people the swami and
I "took." It was more than criminal, now I look back. The lure of
the game and youth held me at it in the beginning and when I was
older I couldn't quit. I didn't know anything else. And I knew
with my past, I could never get a job.
"I remember the first time the swami gyped an old woman. I
didn't realize what a rotten racket his was, or what a fool I was.
She lived in a small town near Akron, Ohio. The Swami was with
a carnival doing a fortune telling act and I was the ballyhoo. I
worked my fire eating stuff (didn't take me long to learn it, but
I
burned myself many times before
I
did master the act) to get the
townies lined up. The swami was working

later trimmed.

white, and

Is
there anyone here whose son died three years ago by

within three years and the mother has white hair, isn't it? Well,
this old lady raises her hand and tells the swami it must be her
son who was killed by a threshing machine almost three years ago.
His name was James. The swami works fast in a case like this and
gets the old lady to write a question to James. While she is doing
that, he is busy answering the questions asked by the balance of
the audience. He got the questions by using the old reliable switch
ing question stunt. (Explained in detail in Chapter XIII.)
"After the show was over the swami meets the old lady person
ally and makes a date to visit her the following morning to see if
he can get Jimmy (as the old lady calls her boy) to bring some
messages. We made a lot of inquiries about town and found out all
there was to know about the old lady and her Jimmy and we
were set.
"About ten the next morning we went over to her house. It was
one of those old farm houses with lots of rooms, none of 'em large,
and low ceilings. You know the type if you ever lived in the coun
try. A sort of house of seven gables, with antiquity written all
over it. The swami took me along for atmosphere. He was cer
tainly shrewd at setting a stage for this kind of show. I didn't
think much of the wrong we were doing. I just f1gured it was a
good laugh.
"When we entered, Mrs. Cole, for that was her name, greeted
us as though we were a gift from the gods. It was a scream. She
gave us home made apple pie, you know the kind one reads about.
It was early in the day, but that kind of pie is the sort New Eng
enders eat for breakfast.
"The swami opens up with a talk about the dead never dying
and that some gifted disciples of the Hindoo wizards and sorcerers
were in touch with spirits at all times. The swami, or to give his
right name, or at least the name he gave me, Billy Taylor, gave
the house and the old lady his blessings, and we were ready to give
the works:
"Taylor starts his spiel like this:

"As Mrs. Cole leaned forward with her eyes and mouth almost
distorted, my mouth also almost fell open. I had been called lots
of things but never 'Beni Russi' before. I hardly knew myself as
a student of the fire eating Hindoos.
"Taylor went on:
"
'Mrs. Cole, to let you see how the spirits protect those who
favor them, I will have Beni Russi drink boiling, burning oil be
fore you, and to prove how honest and reliable we are, the oil we
will use will be kerosene from your own lamp supply.'
"I was beginning to feel ashamed and amazed at the way Tay
lor was putting it over the old lady, because I felt sorry for her,
but I want to say he certainly was convincing. If I hadn't been in
on the stunt, I too would have felt spirits were in and about the
room myself.
"Mrs. Cole got the kerosene lamp. They apparently didn't have
either gas or electric light and I tell you her hands were trembling.
Taylor placed it near the window and sort of salaamed in front
of it. He said:
"Geni of the lamp, Beni Russi is here to do my bidding. Under
your protection, he will proceed.
"He then took the chimney off the lamp and withdrew the wick
and cap. Motioning me to pick up my ladle, he lit the oil. I dipped
the ladle in the stove and while waiting for it to get red hot, he
kept pumping her about her son and his past life.
"Then he says, 'Beni will now eat the charcoal as it glows red
hot and after that we'll try to get a message through from your
boy.'
"I put the fork in the coal stove and took out the smallest piece
I could find and started to eat it. The old lady fainted as the
smoke came out of my mouth. Taylor turned to me and says 'We
got her, so let's work fast.'

slates out of the bag and scrawls a message on it. He then puts

some water on the lady and brings her to. I sure felt like a dog
to be in on the swindle.
"Well, he puts her in a handy chair and while she is getting
over her faint steps in the other room and gets his slate all set.
He was using a roller shade type, and he certainly was good at it.
"Taylor comes back in the room and darkens it by pulling down
the shades, only leaving enough light to come in to make the room
look ghastly. Turning to Mrs. Cole he talks of Jimmy, and how
the spirits have been whispering to him all night about him.
"He then picks up the slate, hands Mrs. Cole a piece of chalk
and says he is ready. Putting the slate in front of Mrs. Cole, and
showing her how it's blank on both sides, he tells her if she will
hold the chalk tightly the spirits will bring her a message on the
blank slate.
"He closed his eyes and certainly put on a good swami act. I
never saw a swami but if they are as good as Taylor, they are
good. Mrs. Cole was trembling all over. The poorly lighted room
and the miracle of drinking boiling oil, and eating red hot char
coal sure had her on edge as it would anyone.
"As Mrs. Cole watched the slate Taylor said suddenly:
" 'Jimmy. Quick! Write a letter to your mother.'
"While she was watching, there comes the message:
Mother Dear I Am Happy. Give this Good Swami
Some Liberty Bonds to Invest for You. I See
You Make Some Money.
"I tell you, it was a shame to take the money. I'm not going to
bore you with what happened, but Taylor left the house with eight
one hundred dollar Liberty bonds and I was on the road to Hell.
Before he went he kept telling her all about Jimmy. The carnival
left town and with it went Mrs. Cole's money.
"I was heartsick over it all, but Taylor gave me $50.00 and I
quieted down after he told me I was equally guilty in the eyes of
the law. That started me off on a real gyping career.

threw in a special session of eating 'red hot steel' in liquid form.
That was reserved for special occasions because sometimes I got
burned with that trick. Taylor and I made real money until I quit
him. I figured if I was going to do the dirty work, I'd get all of
the money instead of just some of it.
"I did pretty well on my own hook using all of Taylor's tricks,
and throwing in some of my own good luck. I don't know if you
know the table for bringing 'messages from Hades,' but I used
that one a lot. Cost me $300.00 for the phoney table.
"I wish you could impress upon everyone to beware of the for
tune tellers and fake spirit mediums. I started to write a book of
my adventures but quit because I was getting in deeper and deeper.
I'm safe writing this letter because I got a 'book' (life term).
"If I had ever thought where my steps were leading I think I
wouldn't have been so fast to accept Taylor's offer. I hope this
letter hasn't been too much for you to read. I just had to write.
"What am I in here for? I hit Taylor over the head with a
poker one night when he drifted into my 'office' where I was
giving 'readings' and wanted to horn in on my trade.
"He said he'd taught me all I knew, and as I was pretty well
fed up with the game when he came in, I walloped him one. He
picked up the poker to come back at me, and in the battle I got it
away from him and let him have it. Didn't mean to kill him, and
it was self defense anyway, but I was handed the limit
"I've been three weeks writing this, so I'll quit now. The
warden knows my story and he'll confirm it. He doesn't know who
I am and neither do you. No one ever shall. If I'd been a fortune
teller though I wouldn't be here now, would I? Well, I'd have
seen my end. As I was one of the 'best,' and landed in the 'pen,'
that shows how far any fortune teller can look ahead."

each night as he lays on the hard mattress in his little
prison cell. My editing it may have taken away some of
his bitterness of expression, but it still remains the out
pouring of a human's heart and soul.
This boy of good family who became a fire eater, a
fortune teller and then a murderer, yet retained enough
family pride to keep his true identity secret, can not be
all bad. His adventure in swindling Mrs. Cole must have
been repeated time and time again . . . and the sad
part of it all is that somewhere this very minute someone
is falling for the same type of deception.
The 'drinking of burning oil,' according to Houdini,
late great master of magic and escapes, dates back to
1 68 1, although in his book "Miracle Mongers and Their
Methods" (E. P. Dutton and Co. 1921) he states that
long before this, charlatans of some type were prob
ably doing the same thing. Probably one of the best
descriptions of how these fire eaters "drink" boiling oil
is given by Walter Gibson in his "Book of Secrets" pub
lished in 1927 by the Mason Publishing Company.
Gibson, a most prolific writer on magical and allied
subjects, states in his book:
"The first and most important principle (in fire eat
ing) is that the mouth, when well filled with saliva,
becomes almost fireproof of its own accord, and strange
as it may seem, can stand heat that the hand can not.
Besides this little known fact, fire eaters employ 'fake'
methods unknown to the spectators.
"In 'swallowing' burning oil, the performer does not
ladle up liquid but merely lets the surface of the spoon
become wet. The few drops that adhere to the spoon
will burn for a few moments, giving the fire eater time

to raise the ladle to his mouth slowly. Then, he exhales,
extinguishing the flame and deliberately puts the spoon
in his mouth, as though swallowing the burning oil."
Simple explanation isn't it? Yet, there are few fire
eaters left, for there is danger even though it all is a
trick. Note in Johnson's letter that he tells how badly
he was burned while learning the "art."
The eating red hot charcoal act that Johnson used to
further impress his victims is just as simple as the swal
lowing of burning oil. It is used today by some of the
Sun Worshipers in rites such as are explained in Chap
ter V. The ordinary fake spirit mediums do not attempt
this type of trick, leaving it to the "experts" in the Sun
Worshipers Cult.
Referring to the Houdini book again for historical
data on this stunt of "eating" red hot charcoal, we find
the first known users of it picked charcoal as the "food"
for the "Fire Kings" of the Middle Ages because even
to the primitive people charcoal was known as a "fierce
burner," as it burns with an extremely intense heat.
Johnson does not say how he worked his trick, but
probably in this manner, as explained by Houdini in the
"Miracle Mongers" book:
"Mixed with the charcoal in the brazier are a few
coals of soft white pine which, when burnt, look exactly
like charcoal. These will not burn the mouth as will char
coal. They are picked up with a fork which will pene
trate the pine blocks, but not the charcoal, the latter
becoming too brittle."
Another time tried method is the one which "employs
small balls of burned cotton (quoting Houdini again)
in a dish of burning alcohol. When lifted on, the fork

these have the appearance of charcoal, but are absolutely
harmless if the mouth is closed immediately, shutting off
the air and, of course, extinguishing the flame."
Houdini also gave the first intelligent explanation of
the "drinking of molten lead." That is a stunt that al
ways fooled me, and if it once puzzled me, after years
of active interest in magic and all that pertains to
it,
I
imagine
it
puzzles you and an explanation
is
welcome.
Johnson's letter brought me many memories of fire
eaters who drink molten lead and some of the fake
spirit mediums who do the same, using their methods.

built up quite a following as a "friend of the spirits"
with his fire eating proclivities. He used to "drink"
molten metal to prove to steel workers he was a rein
carnated steel man. He must have made $50,000 a year
out of the racket.
His method is practically universally used and yet
never detected.
He used a large spoon which he exhibited to the "wor
shipers" as empty. He then dipped it in a pot containing
melting lead which was kept over a huge burning fire.
Exhibiting the spoon full of the molten metal, he tilted
his head backwards and "poured" the white hot liquid
metal down his throat! What a sensation the "wor
shipers" got.
You can do the same thing if you wish, but I warn
you not to try it. Have a silversmith make you a double
handled soup spoon. Buy fifty cents worth of mercury
(quicksilver) from the nearby drug store and pour it in
the handle. As you exhibit the spoon empty, hold the
handle tilted toward you.
When you "dip" the spoon in the molten metal, turn
the handle down, the quicksilver runs out, and you take
it in your mouth. Make a face as though in pain, move
your mouth about and then let the quicksilver fall into
your hand. Exhibit it! You have taken molten metal in
your mouth and moulded it into small balls. Be careful
however not to dip the spoon in the hot metal. And be
extraordinarily careful not to swallow any of the quick
silver.

darkened rooms used by mediums are necessary for its
use. Before I explain how it works, let me give you a case
history in which this slate was the ONLY device used by
a medium to defraud ANOTHER MEDIUM. That
gives you an idea of how good the "roller slate" is.
Just about a year ago in a Western city, near the
Pacific, there lived a "student medium," a Mary Howe
by name, who was a confirmed believer in spiritualism,
ghost messages and all similar manifestations of the
occult.
But since then her faith in the reliability of getting
signs from the other world has been decidedly shaken
for she was fleeced by a "convert" who professed to her
own beliefs.
When the convert, John Malone, first attended a
seance at Mrs. Howe's home he was seemingly impressed
by the mystic "message" that came to him from "Aunt
Cora," long since dead and by the phosphorescent mate
rialization of "Cousin George" who had been killed in
France.
Malone began to take great interest in "spirits" after
Mrs. Howe's seances and became a student medium him
self. He began to exhibit a surprising aptitude for psychic
messages and Mrs. Howe felt great pride in having
brought him in contact with the spirit world.
There came a time a few weeks after the two "kin
dred spirits" in spiritualism had demonstrated to the
other how spirits came and went leaving messages in
their trail, that Malone showed Mrs. Howe a slate
that he said had brought him great results in getting
messages.
Mrs. Howe was anxious to see the slate and Malone
exhibited it to her. It was an ordinary ten cent store

slate to all appearances and Mrs. Howe was satisfied
that it would- indeed be a marvel
if,
as Malone said,
messages flashed on
it
instantaneously.
The room was semi-darkened and both mediums went
into
a
state of "psychic reception," meaning they were
"akin to the spirits." The blank slate was visible
in
the darkness. Malone began to groan, the spirits were
coming
!
"I see them," he shrieked. "There they are
!
Watch
the slate
!"
His voice grew louder and louder. The shrieks were
more piercing. Mrs. Howe was more excited. The blank
slate was trembling
in
Malone's hand.
Crash
!
A weird, uncanny rustle
!
Another shriek from
Malone. A message was on the slate!
It
read:
"Invest in the platinum and gold mine. Malone will give
you details."
Malone stopped his groaning and came out of his
"trance." He glanced at his slate and read the message.
Turning to the bewildered fellow medium, he announced
he did not know what the spirits meant.
He was struck with
a
bright idea. He would do "auto
matic writing" with the spirits guiding his hand. Mrs.
Howe, still half hypnotized with the miraculous mes
sage, agreed.
Producing
a
notebook, Malone started the automatic
writing. Appropriately or humorously the first words
written by the "invisible guiding hand" were:
"The mine
is
at Sucker Creek."
Professing not to understand, Malone continued his
writings. Out of the eerie maps and cryptic "ghost" writ

ings appeared instructions for Mrs. Howe to invest in
this mine. Her money was to be used for the nucleus of a
corporation which was to develop the fabulously wealthy
mine.
Mrs. Howe was not convinced that she should give
up her hard earned money, so Malone continued his
writing. A message came from "Fatima, long dead queen
of the Egyptians" who wrote to Mrs. Howe, through
the medium of Malone:
"I'll spank you if you don't invest."
She then promised Malone she would invest but that
she wanted some time to think things over. He said good
night, taking his slate with him.
Malone returned the following night and produced
the notebook in which appeared the cryptic writings.
Mrs. Howe had invited a few friends, believers in spirit
ualism to see the "new medium" bring messages. He sat
at the table and while the amazed men and women stood
about the table message after message poured from the
spirits onto the pages of the book.
Mrs. Howe and her friends were convinced and as all
the ready cash Mrs. Howe could produce was $885,
Malone got a message from the "Queen Fatima," that
he should use $385 of the money for a car and the bal
ance should be invested in the mine.
For some reason, the mine with its hoard of "gold
and platinum" didn't materialize as promptly as had the
"messages from the dead." Somehow the "contact" had
been broken. Perhaps Malone's guide and "Fatima"
were offended by the lack of more ready cash. For no
more messages came about the mine.
A month of waiting for Malone to get "guidance
from Fatima" passed and Mrs. Howe lost much of her

confidence in her fellow medium whose heavenly mes
sages had ceased, so she turned to a mundane district
attorney with her tale of woe.
Corporeal beings in the form of officers placed the
convert Malone in jail on a charge" of swindling Mrs.
Howe out of her money.
Mrs. Howe, posing as a victimized woman without
friends, related on the witness stand at Malone's trial
that she had been defrauded by her own misplaced faith
in her own religion. She produced a forty-eight page
book full of Malone's spirit writings as well as witnesses
who saw the "automatic writing," being done by him.
The judge did not listen to Malone's plea of "the
spirits did it" and sentenced him to San Quentin Prison
to serve a term of from one to ten years on a charge of
swindling. As he was being led away, Mrs. Howe called
after him:
"I know how you did the automatic writing, but how
did you work the slate stunt?"
Malone called back:
"Don't you wish you knew?"
* * * *
Which brings us back to where we started. For of
course Malone was using a roller slate of the type John
son mentions in his letter.
The so-called "roller slate" derives its name from
the fact that hidden rollers play a great part in its con
struction. It is one of the most commonly used slates by
fake spirit mediums. See the illustration on page 210
and note its working parts. It is very popular because it
is easy to work and the writing appears so suddenly that,
as in the case of Mrs. Howe, it fools even a medium.

slate itself is an absolute "fake." The part that resembles
a slate, is a piece of cloth which the medium paints with
a liquid, or silicate slating, which, when hard and dry,
is similar to the real article.
This cloth is twice the length of the slate but just
the exact width. The two ends of the silicate painted

the rollers allowing the cloth to be pushed up or down
at will.
When the button is pushed, the roller releases the
cloth, and the message which is written on the cloth at
the rear of the frame, obviously snaps about and comes
to the front where the message is visible.
There is a slight hiss and noise when this roller re
leases the side bearing the message, but loud groaning
or moaning, kills the noise and sometimes the hiss of the
cloth aids the effect and is attributed to the spirits.
Automatic writing as worked by Malone is an inno
cent fad which grew out of the Ouija board, popular
many years ago. The pencil is seemingly out of control,
but a clever manipulator pushes the lead wherever he
wants it to go. An amazing thing about automatic writ
ing is that perfectly innocent people get "messages from
the spirits" by that method —and believe it.
Not so long ago a very nice young lady at whose home
I was visiting told me of how she was getting great
results through automatic writings. I was interested and
watched her. The results were fine, but the pencil only
wrote that which her sub-conscious brain told it to.
Many phenomena have come to light through auto
matic writing and while the paragraph above indicates
that the pencil can be controlled, I am convinced that
sometimes unexplainable forces drive it to write messages
beyond understanding. Never, to my knowledge, how
ever, has there been a case of automatic writing bringing
messages to strangers, who paid a medium to get them
some word from "spirits."
This is a good point at which to introduce the fact
that the magicians who offer to duplicate any "spirit
manifestations by material minds" are not absolutely con

vinced that uncanny, weird, inexplicable things have never
taken place. In this connection, let me quote from a book
"Dr. Q" written by C. Alexander for the purpose of
dealing with counterfeit spiritualist mediums with whom
a magician might come in contact. In it is explained that
"by the knowledge imparted by this book, magicians can
separate genuine and false, and thus help in the research
for genuine psychic phenomena."
The author of "Dr. Q" defines his position and that
of almost all magicians so well, I reprint his words
exactly, for they are my own sentiments:
"The author wishes it distinctly understood that he
neither affirms or denies the existence of psychic and
spiritual phenomena, because it would be taking in too
much territory for him. . . ."
BUT, the magicians I know say that genuine spirit
mediums don't tell fortunes, materialize dead people, use
slates to obtain messages, read messages sealed in en
velopes or do the hundred and one "supernatural" things
that fool the public. Beware the medium who goes into a
trance and tells you "Uncle this, and Aunt that" are
sending messages to you.
* * * *
One more trick must be explained. It is referred to in
Johnson's letter, but because of the fact that it is one
of the best revelations in this series, it was saved for
now. And that trick is the one referred to as the "phoney
table for bringing messages from Hades."
This "message from Hades" trickery is one of the
most vicious of all the fortune teller's deviltries. It prob
ably has cost more people wealth and happiness than one
can imagine, yet little is known of
it,
even
in
the magical
profession. Let me give you
a
concrete case.

Ramon Torques had worked for sixteen years as "mess
boy" on a United States battleship. He didn't get much
pay, but whatever he got was saved. Of course, he picked
up tips here and there, and gathered quite a nest egg in
his score of years' service. He left the navy and opened
a small "coffee pot" in a railroad town where Mexicans,
Filipinos and other Spanish speaking types worked. He
was happy hearing once again the language of his people.
About four months after he settled in this town, there
arrived a man who called himself Harli, "Guardian of
the Threshold." He rented a vacant store near the rail
road station and erected a gaudy sign proclaiming to the
world that he knew past, present and future, was master
of all tongues and in particular most modestly admitted
he was a near Messiah.
He didn't tell fortunes for money. No, he was not
interested in gold. He was in business to help others. He
merely sold "Rabbit Foot Luck Charms" for five dol
lars each, and threw in your fortune free. The charms
were made with a metal clasp to hang on one's person. In
a recent advertisement in a well-known magazine they
were offered at $8.75 per gross. Think of his profit!
He wasn't in town more than two pay days when most
of the railroad workers (track repair men and builders)
were wearing these "Luck Charms." The fortunes he
told were wonderful. Every three and four dollar a day
man who consulted him was going to be a millionaire
some day, go home, marry a pretty sefiorita and raise a
big family. Never was there a prophesy of impending
disaster.
Eventually Ramon heard the tales of the miracle man.
With every piece of pie and every cup of coffee he served
he heard of Harli, till finally his superstitions overcame

his common sense and he too bought a rabbit foot charm.
His fortune was somewhat unlike the rest, for the seer
saw him becoming rich overnight. The spirits weren't
working just so, so another session was necessary. Would
Ramon come back tomorrow? He would.
And did. Instead of being received in the outer office
and interviewed behind a screen, Harli took him into a
rear chamber, gaily decorated in those brilliant colors
our citizens in the Islands adore. In this room were two
chairs and a table. Harli took one seat, Ramon the other.
A long and serious talk on religion made Ramon uncom
fortable, for on the battleship he had forgotten the
church of his birth, and the seer's sermon on the other
world touched his conscience. He squirmed in his seat,
wishing the soothsayer would stop.
Eventually he did, and explained that Ramon had been
selected by him out of all the people in town to become
part owner of a diamond mine. Never was a man more
excited, happier or alarmed. Fright because of the pres
ence of the ghosts whom Harli said were all about,
invisible in a cloak that rendered them unseen, but he was
happy over the prospect of being part owner of a
diamond mine.
"Ramon," the seer stated in tones that would forbid
the questioning of the precious words as they dropped
like pearls from his mouth, "I will permit you to join
the inner circle of those who converse and talk with
the gods, and their messengers on earth, the ghosts. I
will not let you see them, but will permit them to write
messages to you. And these messages will come to you
in the brightest light, a feat accomplished by no one
other than myself.

Place your initials at the top and then we will proceed
to bring words from the ghosts that will tell how we are
to obtain possession of the diamond mine, for even I
have not yet learned the entire story of it. All I know is
that the spirits have told me to select one trustworthy
man who has proven himself to be above reproach, and
permit him to share in the wealth which is to come."
Ramon's fingers were nervously twitching and playing
with the paper which Harli had handed him. The same
sense of impatience which had almost upset him when
the seer had been lecturing him on religion now possessed
him again. Harli began his instructions once more.
"Take this pencil and write your initials and date of
birth at the top of the paper. Right ! Now that you have
done so, lay the paper on the top of the table. Let us
begin to invoke the aid of the ghosts."
In an attitude of prayer, the sorcerer raised his hands
toward heaven and rolled his eyes in a manner which
was presumed to be reverential. He started to chant :
"Ghosts who abound and yet never are seen, hear this
prayer. The location of this diamond mine that is to be
the property of this believer, whom I have selected, has
never been disclosed to me. Please come and write before
our eyes its exact address. Then explain what I must do.
By my mystic Occult power, I command you!"
As he stopped the prayer which had been said in a
low monotone with hesitancy marking each word, Harli
turned to Ramon.
"Keep your eyes firmly fixed on the paper. At first
you will feel a cold draft as of the approach of death,
and as that suddenly stops an odd heat will fill the room.
Then, while you watch the paper, suddenly the writing
of ghosts will appear before your very eyes."

As the sorcerer stopped speaking, Ramon felt the
cold breath of death of which Harli had told him. A
chill ran up and down his spine and suddenly as the whiff
of cold air had come it vanished! He opened his eyes
and looked at the paper. It was still blank, and his initials
in his own handwriting were at the top.
In contrast to the suddeness with which he had felt
the cold air come and go, so slowly did a touch of warm
air come as though from the very table itself!
"Look," commanded Harli. "The paper curls. Feel
the heat. 'Tis the breath of the friendly ghost. Even as
the cold air heralded his coming, so does the hot air indi
cate his continued presence. Watch the paper !"
His last words were almost a shout. Visibly, on the
paper as it was curling on the table, writing faintly
appeared. More and more distinct, until finally it was
fully legible.
Ramon was frightened beyond belief. He was about to
rise from his chair and run, when the cold air that he
had felt before hit him full in the face. Sinking back
limply in the chair, and holding the table for support, he
was almost motionless when Harli ordered him to pick
up the paper from the center of the table. The cold air
was gone, and the heat was not as pronounced as
before.
"The ghosts have gone, even as they came, invisibly,"
Harli told him.
Reaching timidly for the paper Ramon picked it up
with shaking fingers. Sure enough, under the initials and
birthdate that he had written but a few seconds before,
was this message from "the dead!"

I Would Have You. I Am a Prospector Who Died

Returning to Civilization After Finding a Won

Giving Best Directions to Find It. Let Harli
Leave Tomorrow and Then Wire You to Come on
to Help Him Develop the Property.
And, below the writing appeared a perfect map giving
exact instructions on how to find the lost mine of the
dead prospector. Ramon was no longer frightened. He
was merely excited.
"I am as greatly surprised and pleased as you," Harli
told Ramon. "I would leave in the morning but I have
no money for railroad and other expenses. You know I
seek no money for myself. I have said this since I first
came to town, so I am afraid you will have to finance
the trip."
Ramon agreed to do so and arrangements were com
pleted at once for Ramon to advance $2200 for expenses
which were to be returned to him out of the first dia
monds sold. Harli was quite willing to agree to the 50-50
split and the men parted, Ramon to return to his coffee
pot and Harli said he would "spend the rest of the night
in prayer."
The following day Ramon gave Harli $2200 in small
bills and bade the seer God-speed. Harli left promising
to wire as soon as he had found the mine and Ramon
agreed to come on.
A month went by and no word came from the "friend
of the ghosts." Another month and Ramon began to
worry. He told his story to Bill O'Hara, head of the
railroad police, who let out a whistle and slapped Ramon
on the back:

Ramon was more thunderstruck by the truth than he
had been by "the visits of the ghosts." His savings of a
lifetime were almost gone. Broken in spirit he went with
O'Hara to the vacant store that Harli had rented.
Entering they found it was unchanged except that the
table was gone. The gaudy banners still hung in place.
The chart of the signs of the Zodiac had not been moved.
Dirty and dusty from the two months of disuse, it held
no touch of the Occult now.
O'Hara looked about for some clue as to where Harli
might have really gone, but could find none. He did come
across an opened bottle marked "sulphuric acid" but that
meant nothing to him in connection with Ramon's loss.
The case was reported to the local police but there was
nothing they could do except send out a general alarm,
which was done at once.
The story fell into the writer's hands and the sup
posedly unimportant half-empty bottle of sulphuric acid
furnished the clue to the whole story. The tale of the
cold and then hot air completed the revelation. The table
of "the message from Hades" had been used with mod
ern "improvements."
The phoney table referred to by Johnson was one of
the genuine "old reliables" when it came to defrauding.
"Messages from Hades" tables utilize the principles of
invisible inks and are worked on a larger scale, with more
elaborate preparation. As explained in another chapter

there are only about fifteen basic methods used by for
tune tellers, fraudulent mediums and Spook Crooks. But
there are about a thousand or more variations. The
table for getting these "messages from the dead" is one,
but it defies detection of uneducated people, no matter
how clever they are.
(See illustration on page 220.)
The table is an ordinary kitchen table to all appear
ances —yet the entire top is false. It is about five inches
thick and in it is concealed a small electric fan (sold at
any chain drug store or hardware shop) and a four
wire bed warmer.
The paper is already prepared when the victim arrives,
the message having been written in which diluted sul
phuric acid, a solution that needs only the application of
heat to bring it out. When the victim writes his initials
on the top of the paper, he does so at the command of
the fake soothsayer who is thus impressing his dupe by
psychology, to prove no paper has been substituted.
He then lays the paper on the table, where shown, a
place that is directly over the heater. The seer "prays"
or stalls for time while heat is being generated in the
wires and at the same time uses the electric fan to force
cold air at the victim. The air comes through minute
perforations in the end of the table. The fan is never
left on long enough to create an impression that the air
is coming steadily from the same place.
Connections to both fan and heater are through wires
which run inside of the table leg nearest the faker, and
then under the rug to a nearby electric light connection.
A cut-off switch is also concealed under the rug, directly in
front of the soothsayer's chair, the fan being controlled

When Ramon looked for the paper on which the

was a mass of yellow pulp. Sulphuric acid eats the paper

CHAPTER X
BANK CASHIER SUICIDE
James Arnold, president of the State Bank of Waukee,
slammed the telephone back on his desk, muttered an
inaudible oath, shoved a group of farm mortgages wait
ing to be O. K.'d in a heap, and swung about on his
swivel chair so he could look out the open window.
"Send Grogan here," he growled to the combination
bookkeeper, secretary and lunch time relief paying teller,
Margery Swanson.
In due time the cashier arrived.
'Grogan," Arnold announced, "Pete Halsey over to
the State Bank of Halaville just called up. Malone, the
bank examiner, just left him. That means we're due to be
looked over tomorrow and I wanted to go fishing. What
shape are the books in?"
"Fine, sir. There is no need for you to be here. Go
ahead. I'll take care of him."
So James Arnold finally decided to go.
When the bank president returned from his trip, his
car had hardly stopped when a crowd began to gather
about him. Every one was so excited, talking all at once,
that Arnold could not at first learn the trouble. Finally
he buttonholed one man.
"Grogan shot himself in the head in the bank at lunch
time today! The bank examiner is there now. Are we
going to lose our money? What's it all about? The doors
of the bank are closed."

Spook Crooks!
One of the junior clerks opened the door for Arnold.
His face was white as he started to explain what had
happened. Arnold shoved him aside and went to his own
office.
There he found Malone, the examiner, going over the
bank's ledgers. Piled besides the books were mortgage
papers, bonds, and piles of cash, all either waiting check
ing or rechecking. Hanson, the chief of police, was per
sonally on guard in his office with drawn revolver, and
besides him was a city detective.
"Malone!" Arnold gasped. "What happened? Did
Grogan really kill himself? Is the bank hit badly? What's
the story?"
In a calm, collected voice Malone related the facts.
"Grogan killed himself about twelve-thirty today when
I was at lunch. There wasn't anything wrong that I could
spot then or now, but there was one piece of paper for
twenty-five thousand dollars that I questioned him about.
It's a loan made to a Mrs. Rose LaBelle. It's O.K.'d
by you, but I wasn't sure that the collateral, East Indian
Copper Mines, was all it should be. All I said to Grogan
at the time was, 'Who's this Mrs. LaBelle, and where
is this stock listed? Looks like too big a loan on an un
known security
' "
"I never O.K.'d such a loan," Arnold broke in. "Let
me see that note."
He nervously scrutinized
it,
particularly looking at
the sprawling initials, "J.B.A.," which were on the back
of the note
in
the place they ordinarily should appear.
"Looks like my writing," the banker said slowly, "but
I
never saw this note before."
Malone took the note back, carefully examined
it
again, and passed
it
to Hanson. The police officer com

pared the initials to those on another note and shook his
head.
"Gentlemen," he stated, "I'm no handwriting expert,
but I have a feeling that Grogan traced the initials on
this LaBelle note and paid over the cash to himself."
"Might be," Malone agreed. "I have checked the cash
and the books and find that everything is absolutely ship
shape. If the note isn't all right, then there is a loss of
twenty-five thousand dollars. But Grogan's bonding com
pany will have to make that good."
He told Hanson to see that the bank clerks placed the
cash in the vaults under his guard, and then instructed
Miss Swanson to have the books and mortgage papers
put away. He swung about in his chair to face Arnold.
"Issue a statement," he told the banker, "that the
bank is in excellent condition, that Grogan's death had
nothing to do with the bank or its affairs and that it will
be open for business again tomorrow. Call the papers
up now and I'll back up any statement you make along
those lines."
When those details were taken care of, and a long
distance call put in to the Bankers' Bonding Association
for a detective, talk swung back to the dead man.
"Grogan didn't need any money," Arnold said posi
tively. "I don't understand all this. He had a nice account
here all the time. I don't understand
it,
that's all."
He was shocked. Not because of the twenty-five thou
sand dollars loss, for he would not have to make
it
good,
but because he had liked Grogan and had seen him climb
from office boy to cashier
in
twenty years' loyal and
honest service to the bank.
"Grogan never spent money," he told Malone. "He
wasn't married, as you know, and certainly the night

life didn't attract him. His work at the church was so
valuable that he became deacon and treasurer of the
missionary funds.
"He always talked of his mother, who died six years
ago. He didn't marry because, he explained, 'I can't find
a girl like my mother.'
"
Hanson returned from seeing the money replaced in
the vaults and told Arnold that a search of the dead
cashier's room revealed nothing that linked him with
any enterprises that might have needed such a great
amount of cash.
He further stated that detectives said that no "Mrs.
LaBelle" lived at the address given on the back of the
note, stating that his officers had found this to be a
boarding house.
"My men are checking up on a woman named Fran-
caise," he said, "who moved last night, but no one knew
any Mrs. LaBelle."
Arnold was hardly seated at his desk the next morning
when a Mrs. Pearson was ushered in. She was a woman
in her early forties, and while not pretty, was well-
dressed.
"I am Clara Pearson," she stated. "The Bankers'
Bonding Association sent me here. Because of my many
experiences in mysterious cases of this kind, the manage
ment felt that a woman operative, as the front or known
detective, could do as well or better than a man. The
odd circumstances made us feel that a quiet investiga
tion was better."
Arnold explained that he had no leads to go on, but
turned over to her the note on which his indorsement
had been forged.
"It must have been a touch of insanity," the banker

said. "And nothing would change my mind except for the
fact of this note. However, it's up to you people. I have
nothing to say that could help. Grogan was a church
member, the funds of the missionary branch of the
church are in perfect shape and his own account still has
a balance of one thousand and fifty dollars."
Mrs. Pearson took the spurious note with her and
left the bank.
Nothing transpired for several days and business
slipped back into the normal routine.
Ten days later a check came for the twenty-five thou
sand dollars with an explanatory note that the detectives
were on a hot trail which would lead to a satisfactory
solution of why Grogan killed himself and just why the
note had been forged.
Another week slipped by. Then Arnold received a tele
gram from Chicago, the home office of the bonding com
pany, which read :
Have Eva Montclair, Alias Edna Francaise, Alias
Rose LaBelle 1984 Wisconsin Avenue Held on
Short Affidavit on Charge of Suspicion of Fraud
Pending Arrival Your City Our Operators.
He phoned Hanson to find and arrest the woman
named in the wire, and waited the arrival of the private
detectives. An hour later Hanson phoned that he had
the woman in jail.
The detectives arrived the following morning and
immediately saw the banker. They explained that Mrs.
LaBelle was an alleged spirit medium, and that Mrs.
Pearson had traced her to various cities from Waukee,
which she had left the evening before Grogan's death,
and had only returned the day of the wire.

"It looked like the work of a fanatic," Mrs. Pearson
explained to Arnold, "as soon as I heard that your
cashier had been a church man and shunned the bright
lights. Instead of making the case complicated, it made
it easy for us.
"A search of Grogan's room revealed literature on
spiritualism, together with several ten-cent store slates.
This was proof that he had been dealing with some for
tune teller who had assumed the guise of a medium for
his especial benefit, or with a regular fake medium who
was out to trim him.
"While the name LaBelle gave us no clew, the Fran-
caise name helped, for an Edna Francaise had once been
in trouble under the name of Eva Montclair, and that
person was known to be in this part of the State. We
got her photograph and description, and then traced the
Francaise luggage. We found that she had gone to Des
Moines, Iowa. We got there a day after she left. There
we were lost until we picked up her path again, this
time at Fort Dodge, Iowa, and then we followed her to
Columbus. At Columbus we lost several days while I
posed as a spiritualist, so I could be introduced to a
maker of the fake apparatus used by spurious mediums.
"It was easy after I was taken in the circle to find
Mrs. Montclair (to give her her own name), for we
found she had returned here. We decided to give her a
day or two here undisturbed to see if she had returned
to 'hook' some one else or if she was coming back here
to recover the missing money. But, when our shadow
wired that she was wandering about Meadow Park,
apparently looking for something, we decided to have
her arrested; our belief is that she has the twenty-five
thousand dollars buried there.

"As she has committed absolutely no crime, our only
hope is to frighten her so that she will return the money
and tell us how she trapped Grogan.
"Legally here are the points. A woman brought stock
as collateral to a bank. A loan was made on this stock.
There is nothing technically wrong in that. It is up to the
bank whether it makes a loan or not. In this case, the
loan was made by a cashier, and had he not forged the
initials on the back, the bonding company would not have
been responsible under his bond. It could say that making
the loan was merely an error in judgment. So, with
nothing on the woman from any angle, it's up to us to
try to recover the money and so scare her that she will
leave town and quit this medium racket."
Arnold listened carefully to Mrs. Pearson, and agreed
that it was lucky for the bank, and unlucky for the bond
ing company, that Grogan had forged the initials. He
further agreed that prosecution was out of the question,
that keeping the whole thing hushed up was best for
the dead man's memory and for the community at large,
but it would be fortunate for the bonding company if the
money was recovered.
Therefore, the two detectives and the banker went to
the County Building, in which city and county jails were
housed, called on Chief Hanson, and gave him a sum
mary of what they had discovered. Hanson had the pris
oner sent for. She arrived in a defiant mood.
"What's the idea of all this?" she demanded. "I'm
going to sue for false arrest."
"Oh, yeah," retorted Harris. "We dug up the money
you planted in Meadow Park."
It was a bluff, but how it worked!
"My God!" the fake medium screamed.

"We'll go easy on you if you'll tell us the whole story
from beginning to end. If not, we intend to have you
tried as an accessory in Grogan's death. We got the
goods on you, and if you don't want to hang, you'd
better come clean."
Another bluff, but it brought results again.
"I'll tell, I'll tell," came hysterically from the lips of
the now totally unnerved woman.
Hanson summoned the police secretary, and started
dictating:
"Whereas, I, Eva Montclair, alias Edna Francaise,
alias Rose LaBelle, without threat or duress of any kind,
knowing that anything I may say may be used against
me in a court of law and trial by jury, but desiring to
freely confess my wrongs, do hereby depose and affirm

"Now, Mrs. Montclair, you start from there."
"I met Mr. Grogan," the ex-medium said, "at a church
affair to which I went hoping to meet some one whom
I could interest in any sort of racket that would bring
me money. Mr. Grogan was a sort of introducer of
strangers, and when he saw me alone, came over to me
and explained who he was. He introduced me to many
people, but when I heard he was cashier of a bank, I
played up to him.
"He seemed to have no interest in women. He seemed
to be interested in the church only. So I explained that
I was a widow and needed a Christian influence. This got
him and I seemed to be getting in his favor. When we
parted that night he told me to meet him at the Sunday
services and that he'd get me a pew down front.

It's called that because it's a handy piece of apparatus
for mediums to have.

how unemotional one may be, the combination of dark

presence of spirits, are bound to rouse fear.
"As soon as the lights were out, tambourines began
to move over the top of the screen, outlined luminously,
ghostly hands began to show and low murmurings could
be heard. This got Grogan and he asked, 'Mother, do

in a small closet convenient to the post. I finally got down
to business. I felt he was now in a mood to be sold. I
certainly did have spirit hands and faces moving about
the room.
"He told his mother that he'd help get the new re
ligion started, and I put the instruments and things back
in the closet. He turned up the lights and removed the
screen. I seemed to be in a dead faint, tied up exactly as
I was when the seance started.
"The following day I got some stock I'd bought some
years ago out of my trunk and took it to the bank.
Grogan had me sign a note and put up the collateral.
He then gave me twenty-five thousand dollars in small
bills so they couldn't be traced, and I was supposed to
give fifteen thousand dollars of this money at once to
Quimbly, the contractor, who was to start work on a
small church for me at once. Grogan and I signed a
partnership agreement, which I'll show you, and I was
all set.
"I talked it over with a shyster lawyer I phoned later
that day, and he said that I'd done no wrong, as all I had
done was to sign a note. I got cold feet anyway and
began to travel about town looking for a place to hide
the satchel in which I'd put the money. I found that
place near the willow tree opposite Grant's monument,

it,

that. I thought I could trim him and he'd never feel the
loss of the money."
Harris started asking questions.
"If Grogan tied you how did you get free and what is
this 'medium's post' you mention?"
"I'll show you the post and explain how it works
when you see it. It's a mechanical device that permits
a medium the use of his or her hands."
"Did Grogan come to you the day before his death
and ask for the return of the bank's money?"
"No, he came and explained the bank examiner was
coming and that there might be a question raised about
the note. He said that I should say the collateral was
worth all I said it was if questioned."
Hanson returned, and took Harris aside.
"The car squad just phoned they found the money
intact in Meadow Park just where she said it had been
planted," the chief said. "They are on the way here now
with it."
"Good," Harris ejaculated. Turning to the medium
he ordered: "Show us where this medium's post is
located, and explain what it is and how it works."
The woman shrugged, and with the men got into the
police department touring car. They drove some distance
out of the city and finally came to a little used side road,
where the fake medium told them to stop. In a ditch
was what seemed to be a solid piece of wood about two
feet square and five feet long. Pieces of rope dangled
out of the top.
"That's a mighty heavy piece of wood," Hanson said.
The medium smiled. "It weighs about fifteen pounds."
With an incredulous expression, Chief Hanson bent
and grasped one end of the post. He braced his feet, to

lift, and the post came up with such ease that the effort
he had placed behind the lift almost upset him.
"It's as light as a feather!"
"It is bolted to a floor," said the pseudo-medium.
"There are braces at the bottom. The post is hollow."
Hanson told the chauffeur to get a heavy wrench from
the car and break in the wooden sides. And the secret
of the medium's post was exposed.
Inside the hollow post was a sliding piece of iron to
which were attached four strands of rope, which led out
of the post at holes in the top, two strands through each
hole. In one side of the iron was a groove. A bolt which
seemingly was used to fasten the brace at the bottom,
actually controlled a ratchet in the bottom and another
in the top of the post. Study the illustration on page 235.
While the medium was letting herself be tied to the
post, the iron was at the bottom, held there by the
ratchet, thus holding the ends of the rope taut and
making it appear that that was all the rope there was.
After the medium was tied, the screen placed around
her and the lights put out, she had simply to release the
ratchet, pull up the iron by drawing her hands back and
away from the post, thus obtaining about four feet of
play. The ratchet in the top (which is not shown in the
illustration) held the iron there while she performed her
tricks.
Whereupon she released the top ratchet, let the iron
slide down inside the post taking in the rope again and
making it appear once more that she was securely and
closely tied.
The play the rope gave her allowed her to reach into
the closet, get the guitar and tambourine and play them,

and effect the other illusions which she had used to im
press Grogan.
There was the slimmest possibility of convicting the
fake medium on a charge of accessory to a fraud, which
would mean exposing Grogan's forgery in court, some
thing to which Arnold would hot agree, and a still
slimmer possibility of getting a conviction on a charge
of obtaining money under false pretenses. But this again
would involve Grogan.
The detectives for the bonding association took Han
son and Arnold aside, and talked this end over again.
"The money is intact, so all we are out is the travel
ing expenses and our salaries," Harris said. "A court
fight to get a conviction would unearth our methods of
working, and also expose Grogan. No one is the loser
except Grogan, who is dead. No charge I can think of
will stick. We better be satisfied to run this woman out
of town."
They agreed, and Hanson confronted her.
"Mrs. Montclair," the chief stated, "we could hold
you on a charge of being accessory to a murder, but
because you have been so frank with us, and because we
have the twenty-five thousand dollars intact, we do not
intend to prosecute."
The medium's face lighted up.
"You mean, I'm free?" she exclaimed.
"Not so fast. If you promise to quit the fake medium
racket we won't hold you. But, don't forget, we have
your confession, and if we ever hear of your working a
stunt like this again, we'll turn this confession over to
the police of any town where you're caught. Get out of
this town right away. If you ever come back you'll be
immediately arrested."

MEDIUM POST
The Medium runs
ropes through the
post (which is hol
low). Ropes pass
through weight
"A," which is then
dropped, bringing
ropes down too.
The medium, tied,
frees herself by
releasing weight at
the bottom (oper

—
then, by lifting the
weight, there is
ample slack to re

The weight "A"

CHAPTER XI
BUNKING BROKERS
AND OTHERS
On a ioor of a mid-town building in New York is a
great organization doing a business running into hun
dreds of thousands of dollars yearly—even in these hard
times. The head of it we will call Miss Smith.
The stock of the organization is other people's belief
that the planets exercise an influence over their lives.
Gullibility plays a great part in its success. Bunk plays
even a greater part. Bunk and the gift of mixing planets,
stars and fancy names—and the gift of gab.
Miss Smith's business?
"Star Gazer" is one name for it. Reading the future
through positions of the stars. Doing all the things the
bearded, cone-hatted diviners of the Middle Ages did
before her, yet doing them so efficiently and gracefully
that money flows in streams into her coffers.
Fully in keeping with the building which houses her
establishment, her outer office is a model of the interior
decorator's art. It impresses even the wealthy stock
brokers who patronize her. Here comes a client. The
slim, beautifully gowned young lady at the reception desk
glides forward. She is certainly charming.
"I am a broker," he introduces himself. "I have some
inside information on a certain stock, but I might be
double crossed in a stock market as uncertain as this.
Some men want me to come into a pool with them. I am

anxious to go in, and also anxious to stay out. It may
be that Miss Smith can help me come to a decision."
"Certainly," replies the reception girl with a smile that
is charming. "She can do that by reading the stars, by
finding out if the planets are in a favorable position for
you. Simply let me have your name and address and I'll
arrange an appointment with Miss Smith.
"The fee for a single service is only one hundred dol
lars, for a consultation. The monthly fee is two hundred
dollars, or two thousand four hundred dollars yearly,
for which Miss Smith will mail you a complete monthly
forecast on the first of every month."
"Let me see how much Miss Smith tells me on this first
visit and I'll discuss the monthly arrangement later," the
broker visitor smilingly agrees.
"Very well," the girl says as she picks up a beautiful
gold appointment book and runs her blue eyes down the
page. "You are lucky. It's now about nine forty-five and
I see Miss Smith has an opening at ten forty-five. If
you'll wait for her, I'll put your name down."
The broker agrees to wait and pays over two crisp
fifty-dollar bills from a well-filled wallet. He is taken
to another office,' small, yet luxuriously furnished, is given
a comfortable chair and some copies of financial maga
zines to read. The reception girl returns at the moment
of ten forty-five, and ushers the broker into one of the
most striking offices he has ever seen.
It is a room almost forty feet long and twenty-five
feet wide, with walls magnificently paneled and hand
carved. In the center is a table, massive and impressive.
On one end of it is a giant globe on a huge swivel.
Painted on this globe are the twelve signs of the Zodiac.

Suspended over it is a disk on which are arranged planets
and stars which can be moved at will.
As the broker enters the room a stately woman of un
certain age rises to greet him. He is introduced to Por-
tentia Smith. He is frankly skeptical. He is asked the
month of his birth. He gives
it,
and Miss Smith arranges
her globe and disk. She says, with eyes that never leave
his, and
in
words which never falter
:
"According to the stars you are married to
a
woman
named Elizabeth. She
is
slightly younger than you. Your
children are seven and ten, the younger being
a
boy and
the elder
a
girl. Their names are Harold and Betty. You
own
a
Packard automobile."
The broker can hardly believe his ears. Every word
is
true. Miss Smith says that she
is
now ready for any
question he cares to ask, that she has given these facts
about himself merely to show she possesses the power
to make the stars reveal facts to her.
"Miss Smith," he commences, "I'd heard a great deal
about you, but your reputation does not even do you
justice. Before we go any further, let me give you
a
retainer for the monthly service your assistant sug
gested."
Raising her left hand on which reposes
a
remarkable
emerald held
in
place by
a
platinum band engraved with
the planets,
in
each of which are inserted star-shaped
diamonds of richest blue white brilliance, Miss Smith
smilingly rejects his offer, advising him that business mat
ters involving money are not of interest to her and that
he should see the cashier on the way out. This further
impresses the visitor, who asks
:

the market. I like the stock, but frankly I am afraid
of the crowd in the pool with me. I want your advice."
The star gazer takes a piece of paper on which are
drawn stars, makes astronomical designs on
it,
compares
the signs of the Zodiac governing his birth month, and
the present month, arranges the planets on the overhang
ing disk, does what seems to her visitor some higher
mathematical problems, and then gives her decision.
"This deal
is
a
bad one for you. The overhanging dark
clouds obscure the brighter ones for you just now. The
stars are not right for your immediate success, and gen
erally
I
advise you to leave the deal alone."
Miss Smith arises, signifying the interview
is
over.
The pool in which the broker had been invited to par
ticipate
is
formed without him, the European situation
grows worse, the market falls and Miss Smith has
a
"client" who firmly believes her advice because she saved
him at least $100,000.
Any one reading the true incident above might have his
faith
in
fortune tellers strengthened or revived, but, wait.
The day prior to the visit of our lucky stock broker
friend, Miss Smith had been consulted by another broker.
This broker had the same story to tell. He wanted to go
in
the pool to buy Blank stock, but he, too, was afraid of
double cross.
After her usual rigmarole Miss Smith advised him to
go into the pool. One broker had to win—one had to
lose!
She would get one steadfast client out of
it,
no matter
what happened.

The believer in astrology may say:
"All right, we'll admit Miss Smith made a mistake on
the advice she gave the first broker —but she didn't make
the error. She simply read the stars, and if they gave her
the wrong information, and the first broker's 'control
stars' indicated success when it didn't come, you can't
blame Miss Smith. Also, if Miss Smith is not genuinely
able to read stars, how did she know the names of the
broker's wife and children, and their ages?"
Here the believer grins all over. He certainly has the
skeptic stopped now.
No, he hasn't, for the method Miss Smith used to
obtain her information is one that has been in use by
fortune tellers since telephones were invented.
What happened was this. When the broker gave his
name to the reception girl he started a chain of investiga
tion into his whole life. The first step the girl took after
putting him in a private office was to telephone the
broker's office, explain that she was with such and such
a newspaper and wanted Mrs. Broker's home telephone
number. The unsuspecting operator at the other end
promptly gave the number.
The reception girl then phoned Mrs. Blank and stated
that she was the such and such photographic studio and
that the rotogravure section of a newspaper had re
quested her to make an appointment to photograph her
with her children. She then asked and obtained Mrs.
Broker's maiden name, her children's names and ages.
Then she asked Mrs. Broker if she could have the
photographer picture them in the family automobile.
Obviously the next question brought out the name of the

car. This information the assistant gave Miss Smith, who
was then ready for the "consultation."
The following day probably pictures were taken, to
avoid the possibility of Mr. Broker of even suspecting
anything. If he hadn't signed up for the year's service,
no photographer would call. Miss Smith had the hundred
dollar fee, and it wouldn't make much difference whether
Mr. Broker suspected or not.
There's another ramification of the picture-making
angle. Suppose one of Mr. Broker's children, or wife,
died within a year or two, or while he was a client of the
soothsayer. It would be a simple matter to give a fake
medium one of the pictures taken (no proof of which was
ever shown the family), and later have a "spirit photo"
reproduced for Mr. Broker at some huge price.

Helen Nolan was a rabid radio fan. She listened in
every spare moment. She was in her early thirties, un
married, a school-teacher with much time to herself as
she rarely went out, and lived in Los Angeles.
Early in 1930 she heard a certain astrologer give a
talk on the radio about the stars and their positions. He
invited the listeners to give the date of their births, and
mail them to him for a "free reading." Miss Nolan sent
for everything offered on the air, whether it was baby
food or literature on the latest automobile. She wrote
the astrologer, giving her birthday.
A few days later she received a reply which was most
vague, although it did give certain characteristics that
Miss Nolan felt were hers. Inclosed with the letter from
the astrologer was an offer to send a complete horoscope

to her for one dollar. It would give a complete history
of all those born on the same day, as well as a complete
analysis of character. As an added inducement, a dream
book would be sent free, which would explain in detail
anything that the reader ever dreamed.
Miss Nolan hastened to send the dollar. Within a
short time the dream book and the horoscope came. Miss
Nolan carefully studied
it,
and found that, according to
the book, she was totally unfitted for teaching school.
And even though she had been in the school system for
thirteen years, because the horoscope told her that she
was cut out to be an actress she resigned her position
within
a
month after receiving the book!
She registered at the casting office which supplies
Hollywood motion picture studios as
a
"type," and
waited over four months before she was even called for
a
test. Elated at what she called her "success," she made
an appointment to see the astrologist personally. After
paying
a
fee of one hundred dollars she was ushered into
his presence.
After studying the signs of the Zodiac, and deliberat
ing for some time, he asked her
if
she had any inclina
tion to act. Miss Nolan earnestly assured him that she
had. The stars were right and the seer began to outline
her great future.
Although Miss Nolan did not hear from her screen
test she kept going back faithfully to the astrologer for
private readings. He continued to tell her that she would
be successful, and to have patience.
Several months had passed from the time she had
resigned her position as
a
teacher. The constant drain
on her resources had practically beggared her, and the
constant strain on her mentality had gradually broken

down her health. The principal of her former school
saw her one day on the street. Aghast at her apparent ill
health, the principal stopped and questioned Miss Nolan.
She poured out the story of her attempt to become an
actress and the part the astrologist had played. The
principal immediately took action. He reported the case
to the district attorney, but it brought no action, because
astrologists assert that their predictions are based on
absolute science, quoting the fact that the United States
Government employs astronomers and that "the work is
similar"—a ridiculous claim.
The principal, however, took such an aggressive stand
against the broadcasting station that the station banned
the astrologer. t
Miss Nolan left for the back hills of California, where
she stayed several months recuperating. On her return
to the city she started a campaign against all seers and
soothsayers which proved most successful.
It is a known fact that in the movie settlements on the
West Coast fortune tellers find a most fertile field. Cases
are being reported constantly, involving film players, and
were the names to be made public movie goers would be
shocked and amazed.
The author and Messrs. Davids and Herman were
talking recently about the broadcasting methods of seers,
and the case of Miss Nolan came up. They stated that
there were hundreds of such cases yearly, some worse,
in which the victim actually lost all sense of judgment.
The horoscope "racket" is a most profitable source of
revenue for the fakers. One astrologer of whom I am
thinking, it may not be the one Miss Nolan heard, re
ceived over one hundred thousand letters in response to
his radio "free reading" offer. To all he sent the same

letter referring to the one dollar horoscope book, with
the dream book thrown in. Out of this one hundred thou
sand more than thirty-one thousand letters were received
inclosing the dollar! Think of
it,
thirty per cent of his
listeners fell for the proposition

The horoscopes for which he gets

in
Columbus the huge sum of three cents each. The dream
book costs but one cent. As the one who asks for the

it
costs nothing for addressing or mailing the dollar offer.
The mailing of the dream book and horoscope costs
three cents. So for the dollar he receives he has only
seven cents expenses. It's a
nice business!
A magician told me he saw

a
list of one thousand fortune tellers who use from
fifty to one hundred thousand horoscopes regularly. This

Scientists and astronomers of international repute have

"The Smithsonian Institute has no evidence which it considers
to prove that the fortunes of individuals can be told by fortune
tellers, astrologers or spirit mediums.
"The Institute believes that the fortunes of individuals pri
marily depend on their own exertions and secondly on the influ
ence of future environment, and in general are not predictable."
"Popular Science Monthly," a magazine of unques
tioned authority, now edited by Raymond J. Brown, a
noted scientist, commissioned Jesse F. Gelders, a writer
of repute, to ask a selected group of recognized astrono
mers and physicists whose life work had been spent in
a study of the stars in an attempt to pierce the mysteries
of the universe, whether or not there was anything to
astrology —and if it was a science.
The group included Professor Frank Schlesinger, of
the department of astronomy at Yale University; Daniel
W. Hering, professor emeritus of physics at New York
University; Professor E. W. Brown of the department
of astronomy of Yale, and president of the American
Astronomical Society; Dr. Clyde Fisher, curator of as
tronomy of the American Museum of Natural History,
and president of the Amateur Astronomers' Association ;
Dr. D. Brouwer, of the department of astronomy at
Yale; Professor Henry Norris Russell and Professor
John Stewart, of the department of astronomy at Prince
ton; Professor George P. Pegram, of the department of
physics at Columbia, and W. J. Eckert, instructor in as
tronomy at Columbia.
By the courtesy and permission of "Popular Science
Monthly," I am reprinting some startling proofs of why
scientists all call astrology a fake and a fraud:—

no scientific basis whatever for the deductions and predictions

made by astrologers, and that there are no known forces or influ
ences such as the astrologers ascribe to the stars and planets.
"It is just as impossible to foretell the future by gazing at the
stars as it is by peering at a mess of tea leaves or shuffling a deck
of cards.
"Dr. Walter Franklin Prince, Research officer of the Boston So
ciety of Psychic Research, recently induced a friend to send the
year, day, and minute of birth to six different astrologers, inclos
ing a fee for a horoscope.
"The six replies were all different and all wrong. We asked
each, 'Shall I marry this year?' Not one learned from the stars that
the man was already married. In all social, matrimonial, and busi
ness matters the racketeer star gazers guessed ninety percent
wrong.
"Professor Schlesinger, of Yale, voiced the opinion of the sci
entists when he expressed himself to the effect that astrology, as
most astrologers know, is the bunk.
" 'If there were any basis for astrology, astronomers would be
very glad to know of it,' he told me. 'Some of us have gone into
it. I have, and I have come to the conclusion that there is no basis
for its claims. I believe that most astrologers are conscious
charlatans. A few of them are sincere.
" 'Most of them ask the client only what day he was born. Now,
thousands of people are born every day. Yet, they have different
characteristics, and lead very different lives.
" 'A few astrologers want to know the exact minute of birth.
Of course, very few people are able to give them that information.
It so happened that I did know the exact minute of my son's
birth. I decided to test the 'Knowledge' of one of these 'precise'
astrologers, and sent him the information. The horoscope I re
ceived in return was no more accurate than if a cat had cast it.
"Professor Emeritus Hering, of New York University, also has
made a personal investigation of astrology. Two words sufficed
him to characterize it. He found it 'inconsistent and absurd.'

Professor Schlesinger's and Professor Hering's statements.
"Their own methods and utterances branded the astrologers as
'conscious charlatans' whose conclusions and predictions are incon
sistent and absurd !
"This is how many of them worked their game:
"Horoscopes were sent in return for the wrappers of advertised
products. Replies were given to questions: and 'destiny charts'
and tabulations of 'favorable and unfavorable hours' were sold
for sums of one to ten dollars. Wonder books were offered for

more foretell the future than can you or I. The stars and the
planets 'have nothing to do with the case.'
"
Writing from the Mt. Wilson Observatory, Prof. Rus
sell wrote the author :
"Popular Science Monthly quotation from me correct, and I
heartily sympathize with attitude you have taken that astrology
does not foretell the future."
Prof. Samuel C. Hooker, Doctor of Philosophy, a
man of unimpeachable standing in the scientific world
made the following statement to the author: —
"I am personally convinced that astrology, as now practised, is
carried on with the knowledge that it has no foundation whatever
in fact, and that the recent books having reference to it have been
written with that knowledge. In my opinion astrologists should not
be permitted to broadcast, as a great deal of harm can be done in
this way to uneducated listeners. It
is,
of course, possible that
there may be some, who are practising astrology, who have been
misled
by
fraudulent writings which they are taking as their
guide."
Sir James Jeans, one of the greatest living astrono
mers,
in
one of his recent books "The Universe About
Us" sums up astrology as being "dead" among as
tronomers. He states:
"At first astronomy, like other sciences, was studied for mainly
utilitarian reasons.
It
provided measures of time, and enabled
mankind to find its way. ... In the guise of astrology,
it
held
out hopes of telling him his future.

went wrong was in supposing that terrestrial empires, kings and
individuals formed such important items in the scheme of the

CHAPTER XII
SPIRIT SLATES
Mary Shane had been a widow but a few short days
when, as she later put
it,
"an iligant lady" drove up to
her home,
a
cozy little, vine-covered cottage
in
that part
of Chicago known as "Irishtown." The visitor, exquisitely
dressed
in
black, introduced herself as "Mrs. Martin,"
and was more than sympathetic in expressing her deep
sympathy on Mrs. Shane's bereavement.
After explaining that she, too, was recently widowed,
Mrs. Martin stated
:
"It's an odd errand,
a
rather queer one, Mrs. Shane,
that brings me here today. Last night at Madame
M
's
you know, the great spirit medium —when
I
was
getting
a
message through her from the spirit world and
my dear departed husband,
a
new spirit intruded into
our talk. He said he was Tim Shane, and that he lived
in this house when on earth. He told us all about you,
so I've looked you up."
As Mrs. Shane was hardly over the hysteria death
brings to some people, any news of her late husband,
no matter how strange and no matter how foreign to
her thoughts and beliefs, was welcome. Hence, she was
most receptive to her visitor's talk. And Mrs. Martin
began to tell of various personal incidents
in
the life of
the Shanes that Mary thought no one could know but
her late husband.
"No one not
in
the spirit world could know these

things about you and your husband, could they?" queried
Mrs. Martin.
"Not a soul," answered Mrs. Shane, wide-eyed, and
she begged Mrs. Martin to take her to Madame M .
Mrs. Martin would be happy to.
In a flurry of nervous excitement, Mrs. Shane got in
Mrs. Martin's handsome sedan. En route, Mrs. Martin
cautioned her not to say that she was Mrs. Shane, but to
find out if Madame's "guiding spirit" would reveal the
fact of her identity.
On arriving at the home of the medium, Mary was
shown into a room that was utterly bare save for a
kitchen table, two chairs, and a low-burning oil lamp
which cast a ghastly shadow over the entire room.
The table was pushed back against the wall, near a
pair of heavy purple curtains. Against the curtains was
one of the chairs, and directly opposite was the other.
There was a strange and weird atmosphere about the
room. There was the musk of exotic perfume. Not a
sound could be heard. The silence of death prevailed.
The whole setting gave off a singular feeling of fear
which was imparted to the trembling visitor —a fantastic
fear of the unknown and unseen.
A rubber-soled maid, or attendant, directed Mary to
sit on the chair at the end of the table nearest the cur
tains. "Madame M will be here directly," she mur
mured. "Have patience. Be not afraid." Mary waited
apprehensively, and a few seconds after she had almost
fallen into the seat, and before she was able to calm her
self, she was startled to see a woman enter garbed in the
traditional white flowing robes which mediums have af
fected since those days in the early fifties of the last
century, when spiritualism first came into vogue.

The medium sat in the chair opposite Mary, took
both her hands and looked into her eyes. In a deep,
almost sepulchral monotone, devoid of inflection, she de
claimed.
"I know you, my dear. You are Mary Shane. I saw you
in a trance last night. Your husband's spirit spoke to me.
Your maiden name was O'Hare. You and Tim met for
the first time at a dance they gave at Easter. Be of good
faith. Do not doubt."
For fully five minutes, Madame M spoke in the
awe-inspiring voice, spoke of Mary's and Tim's life, the
loss of their only child, until the very marrow in Mary's
bones seemed frozen.
In creepy tones, the medium continued:
"Take this slate. Then this water. Wash it well. Then
place it in front of you. Now, take this pad of paper.
While I prepare for the trance in which I must go to
receive messages from the spirit world, write any three
messages you want to send to Tim. Then tear off the
sheet, fold it three times, and hold it tightly. No one
but you must know what you have written there."
With this Madame M left the room silently,
like a ghost, as Mary prepared to write. With trembling
fingers she penned her questions to her late husband. She
had finished writing but a few seconds when the medium
returned as silently as she had gone, carrying with her
a lighted candle carefully centered in what appeared to
be an ordinary cheap candle holder.
Seated at the table, she asked Mary for the message,
which was promptly, nervously handed over, folded
three times. The medium then asked if any one had
seen her write. "N-no," Mary stuttered; whereupon the

medium held the paper to the flame of the burning
candle, chanting:
"Oh, great spirit guide, oh my Indian control, to you
I send on wings of flame this word to one of the dear
departed. Take from the smoke as it goes upward toward
heaven the message from the earth-bound."
Much as a snake, hypnotizing before it strikes, the
medium stared at Mary, held her entranced. She turned
the oil lamp down until it gave but a flicker. Then she
placed the candle on a shelf so its dim light made her
appear ethereal, unreal in her white robe. She took up
the slate. A minute of silence. Then :
"Have you washed the slate?" she asked. Mary
nodded dumbly. "Then, look. On it I write your name.
Place your hands above your head. I put the slate in
them. Hold the slate tightly. Do not take it down until
I tell you. Now, I go into a trance."
With this she swung from side to side, muttering and
chanting unintelligible words. Suddenly she was still for
a second. Then, amidst moans and groans, as beads of
perspiration ran down her face, she asked :
"Have you answered, great Lo, my Indian Spirit
guide? . . . You have? . . . Then all is well."
With a start, she awoke from her trance, blinking her
piercing eyes, and pinching the skin about her temples.
"Take your hands down," she ordered Mary. "See if
the spirit brought you word from Tim."
Mary, trembling, looked at the slate as the medium
slowly turned the meagre light of the lamp higher.
There, sure enough, on the slate she had held tightly
grasped in her hands, was a message, "in Tim's own
handwriting," she later said.
The message read:

I am well and happy here in spirit land. Do not
mourn. Come to-morrow and I will talk with you. Do
not pay off the mortgage. Keep the $6,000 insurance
money intact. I miss you, but am with you.
Madame M , by this time fully recovered from
her trance, then asked what the message had been which
Mary had written. Mary explained she had asked Tim
if he were happy, whether she should pay off the mort
gage, and if he missed her. She was ecstatic.
"Saints be praised!" she cried. "Blessed Mother, I
thank you !"
II
Mary soon became a steady visitor to Madame
M . No fee was ever charged, for, as the medium
expressed
it,
"I do this out of love for my fellow people."
Mary's attendance at the Church of the Ascension
dropped off. She lived in
a
state of ecstasy. She told her
neighbors of her experiences, and elaborated upon them
:
"Faith, and it's true.
I
write on
a
piece of paper. Some
times Madame M burns
it
up and sometimesIdo

She never even touches it. Writing appears on

wash, in Tim's own handwriting. Sometimes, 'specially
when Madame M does not even touch the paper,
the guide puts Tim's answers to my questions right in
her own mouth. 'Tis
a
miracle."
Three weeks of steady visits instilled
in
Mary
a
con
fidence
in
the medium that Father
S.
J.
Flannery
couldn't shake, when, after Mary's repeated absences
from church, he called to see
if
she were ill. The priest
did his best to show how impossible
it
all was, but she
stubbornly insisted: "'Tis
a
miracle."

Came a time, only two days after the priest's visit,
when Madame M sent her maid to tell Mary to
come at once about a "special message." Rushing to the
medium's home, Mary found Madame M garbed
in the flowing robes in which she had originally seen her,
but this time she was rolling on the floor with foam
rushing from her mouth, as she muttered in agony:
"I've sent for herl I've sent for her! Tell me, Tim,
dear departed, before you fade away, what it is. Oil?
In the lamp? No?—then again speak. I do not under
stand."
Mary stood spellbound and speechless before the spec
tacle. Her horror was as intense as her wonder. She had
been warned that she should never say a word while the
medium was in a "foaming" trance. Mary could not
understand the medium's words for a moment, then, she
heard:
"In the land is oil—not in the lamp ! Yes, yes, I under
stand! Go on! Where is this oil? What is it? Golden
dollars flowing? Wealth appearing? For who? For your
Mary! Yes, I know! I'll tell her. Where is this oil? In
Oklahoma. Yes, where? In Ardmore. Yes, yes. What is
the name of the company? The Shaft Oil Wells. Yes,
yes. I'll tell her!"
Minutes more of this. Then, with a shout the medium
fell in a faint. She was quickly revived when Mary
fanned her with a newspaper. Wiping the foam from
her mouth, she asked Mary what had happened. Mary
told her, and the medium said she'd never heard of the
Shaft Oil Company, but would investigate.
The following day she sent her maid for Mary, who
came in a taxi —a great extravagance for her. Madame
M said that she had carefully investigated the com

pany, and had all the details. But before Mary invested,
she said, she would go in another trance and ask Tim's
further advice. This she did at once, and while in the
trance she stated that Tim had sent the message that
she should invest her $6,000 insurance money.
Mary immediately went to the bank and withdrew
the funds in small bills, as she had been instructed.
Madame M gave her one thousand shares of Shaft
Oil Company in exchange, telling her she was on the
road to millions, of which she wanted no part herself.
She only wanted to be thought of as the messenger of
the spirits.
Ill
Months went by. Mary became more and more im
patient and less credulous as no returns came in from the
oil wells. Finally she turned back to the church of her
birth for advice. Father Flannery went to the First
National Bank, where he learned there was no company
of the name of Shaft, and that within two weeks half a
dozen people had asked about the outfit.
The priest then went to Madame M and de
manded the return of Mary's money. He was told to
come again that night, when it would be returned. Had
he turned back as he left the porch the malignant ex
pression of the medium would have warned him not to
let Madame M escape.
On his way back to Mary's he bethought himself of a
parishioner, Detective Captain O'Brien, and changed his
route, going to the police station. There he unburdened
his story.
Captain O'Brien heard him patiently, then said he had
many complaints against Madame M , but could do

nothing because no one would sign the necessary com
plaint on which to issue a warrant. Father Flannery sent
a message to Mary to come to the police station. On her
arrival, he persuaded her to make the formal complaint.
This done, Captain O'Brien and two of his men set out
for the home of Madame M .
They rang the bell. No one answered, and finally they
broke down the door. There were signs of hasty pack
ing—and the bird had flown.
The newspaper publicity which followed brought
dozens of victims to light, including a noted attorney's
widow. Facts proved that in eleven months the medium
had obtained $142,000 for stock in a company that did
not exist.
* * * *
The methods used by Madame M were very
simple.
Obviously Mrs. Martin was a "capper," or in commer
cial parlance a "salesman" for the medium. The name of
Mrs. Shane had been obtained from the death notices
in the local newspapers. Incidentally, these death col
umns bring live leads to many workers of nefarious
rackets. (See Chapter II.)
After Mrs. Martin picked Mrs. Shane as a possible
victim, she visited neighbors, friends and near-by store
keepers for information on the prospect. Putting all this
information together, she and the medium worked out
the sales talk to be used on Mrs. Shane. The information
Mrs. Shane thought no one but her husband and herself
knew, was common gossip. It made the foundation on
which Madame M built Mrs. Shane's confidence in
her.
As to the actual workings in the medium's parlor, the

simplest tricks of a magician were invoked. Practically
all mediums operate in dimly lighted rooms, for they
state the spirits dread the light. The actual reason for
the darkness is simple. Most people since childhood have
been afraid of the dark, and the weird effect of the bleak
darkness overshadows some of the crude sleight-of-hand
or trick moves that the medium makes.
The foam in the medium's mouth, as explained in
Chapter VI is easily produced by a small piece of soap.
The burning of the message was a case of sleight-of-
hand. The candle holder that the medium used had a cut
out base with clip. (See illustration lower left corner,
page 259.)
When Mrs. Shane folded her message three times
in the manner the medium described, and gave it to
Madame M , the medium hid or palmed the real
message and substituted a blank piece of paper folded
the same way. Then, while Madame M talked to
divert Mrs. Shane's attention, she slid the real message in
the bottom of the candle holder. If you recall, Madame
M placed the candle and holder on a shelf. Back of
this shelf was a sliding panel. An assistant took out the
message, read
it,
wrote an answer on
a
slate he had, one
exactly like the one Mary washed, and when the medium
put the slate over Mrs. Shane's head, made
a
simple
substitution. (The illustration on page 259 shows the
simplicity of this move.)
It so happened that Mrs. Shane's questions gave the
medium just the information she wanted. Had they not,
another day would have come
in
which one of the answers
to
a
question could have been, "Don't invest the
in
surance money." Mrs. Martin had probably found out
from neighbors just what the amount was.

wrote. The fake medium only needed to get possession
of the tablet while the victim folded her message.
When this was done, it was an easy matter for her
to leave the room, or have the maid gather up the pads.
Taken into another room, plumbago or any dark-colored
powder was sprinkled on the wax sheet. This powder
sticks in the impressions made in the wax, and the mes
sage could be easily read.
The rest was easy for the medium, but hard and

"man who can not die !"
If you saw a man hung —and returned to life—if you
were told by a "friend of the dead" that your money
would double if "properly invested"—that from being
out of work you'd get "the finest job in the world" —
what would you do—would you believe him?
More than eleven thousand people contributed to the
coffers of "The man who can not die !" Would you?
The Man Who Can Not Die!
See Him Hung. He Talks After Death!
Let Him Bring You a Message
From the Dead!
The above was part of a huge placard that startled
the third class city of Middleboro early this year. Many
more phrases, equally unbelievable appeared in large let
ters. Promises of "The Spirits will foretell your future"
and "Employment Guaranteed" were in prominent lines.
"From far-off Burma comes the miracle worker of the
Orient" was another catching line. No wonder there
wasn't an office that day or home that night in the thriv
ing city of sixty thousand wherein "The man who can
not die" was not the sole topic of conversation.

eight o'clock the fire department ordered the manage
ment to stop selling tickets. Too many had already
jammed their way in.
Hundreds in the streets were sent home disappointed.
For unemployment was rampant in town and the prom
ise of employment drew the crowds even as a magnet
draws iron.
Inside the masses shouted and called, but the curtain
remained down until exactly eight-thirty. Then every
light in the house was extinguished and in place of the
white theater lights an unearthly green illumination from
the balcony arc lamps filled the amphitheater. The audi
ence was awed. A sort of mass hypnotism.
The curtain rose. In the center of the platform was a
great gallows. A heavy rope, with a hangman's huge
knot in the end, dangled gruesomely from the center of
the scaffold. The weirdness of the lights which threw a
ghastly green shadow over the gibbet sent a shiver of
apprehension down every one's spine.
Suddenly, from the right side of the platform, came a
beat of African Tom-Tom drums ; the dreary monotony
of the cadence added to the ghostly impression.
Then, as the drums stopped with a loud "Thomp,"
there stepped to the center of the platform the tallest
Negroid type ever seen in America. He seemed fully
seven feet tall. To add to the effect of his height a turban
was wrapped about his head in spiral form and at the
very crown of point was a flashing red stone.
"My friends," he declared in an odd English accent,

Sengeni, the medicine men of Burma. I was persuaded

Madame Fitzhugh, famous spiritualistic mediums, to
whom I now introduce you."
As a cue on a stage, out stepped a man dressed in
tropical white clothes. Fitzhugh wore a monocle and sun
shade hat to lend atmosphere to his clothes and his
wife heightened the effect with a huge sun umbrella
which she placed in the shadow of the scaffold.
Ben Mohamet Abu took up his chain of talk, as the
mediums acknowledged the applause.
"These mediums," he continued in his jumbly phras
ing, "will bring messages to you, from me after I am what
you people call 'dead.' The madame will go among you
and ask you to write messages to the dear departed
that you know. Any, now in the spirit world, may be
addressed. While she is doing that, Prof. Fitzhugh with

in that state called 'dead.' You will find that my answers
which you will receive through Madame Fitzhugh are
correct and true. I want you all to keep perfectly still
while I am being hung.
"Madame Fitzhugh, will you please go among the
audience and have the questions written. Remember my
friends, let no- one see what you write. Personally keep
the paper on which you write at all times. Fold
it,
con
ceal
it,
do what you will with
it,
but let no one see it.
I
now retire to prepare for the ordeal."
As Madame Fitzhugh went into the audience, she
was joined by four girls, all of whom were also carrying
paper on similar boards. The medium spoke.

"The paper attached to this board, is ordinary writing
paper. You will note that it is perforated in five places
so that each huge sheet contains enough paper on which
six individuals may write their individual messages to
the dead.
"We have one hundred of these boards so that we
could answer six hundred questions tonight, but as that
would be too great a strain on Ben Mohamet Abu, we
will use only fifty. That means we will bring answers
from the spirits to three hundred individual questions.
"Any whose questions we do not reach please call
again tomorrow. There is nothing prepared about the
paper, and you need not be afraid to use it. However,
if you prefer, use your own paper. Simply tear off the
perforated piece we supply and place your own paper
on the board to make your writing easier."
As she finished talking the boards and paper were
distributed. The house lights were turned on again and
the curtain fell. A buzz of excited "What shall I write
whispered to wife, sweetheart or friend, swept through
the audience.
The medium and her assistants quickly saw all the
boards were passed out and as the last one in each aisle
tore off the last piece of perforated paper, took back the
blank wooden boards.
The curtain rose and Madame Fitzhugh returned to
the platform. The girl assistants had gone, taking the
boards with them. The medium raised her hand for
silence.
"You now have had an opportunity," she said, "to get
in direct touch with the spirits. Keep tight hold on your
questions. For we are ready to proceed with the most
important part of the program."

Abu and Prof. Fitzhugh came on the platform arm
in arm. The Burmese wore but a loin cloth. Marching to
the gallows they stopped. Abu faced the audience.
"Let the lights change," he commanded and again the
white lights went out and the green ghastly ones re
turned. In stilted English he continued:
"I asked for volunteers a few moments ago. Let them
come right up. I warrant they will not be made fun of
by me, for this is a serious business. All I want them to
do is to assist in hanging me. Do not be afraid. I have
gone through this thousands of times and Prof. Fitzhugh
will guarantee them against damages if I do not recover
from the 'death' spell."
It was difficult to obtain assistants, but after much
coaxing five huskies, whom every one in the auditorium
seemed to know, mounted the platform. Fitzhugh intro
duced Abu to each and explained their work.
Standing directly under the gallows Abu bowed to
the audience and motioned to Fitzhugh to proceed. The
medium released a catch that brought the heavy rope
with the huge hangman's noose, which had hung in sight
from the beginning, to the floor of the platform.
He then had one of his volunteer assistants slowly
walk away with the rope taking up the slack until the
noose was neck high to Abu.
The medium placed the knot about the neck of the
Burmese! A shiver went through the audience. It was
almost an audible protest.
Madame Fitzhugh brought the black hood custom
arily placed on all condemned men's heads. She dropped
it on Abu's head.
The green lights seemed to flicker, their ghostly hues

bringing suppressed nervous laughter, fear or excitement
to every one.
Abu lifted his hands to adjust the noose. As he did
so, Fitzhugh announced:
"You saw the noose about Abu's neck. We now will
tie his hands behind his back so he can not touch the
rope. When I give the signal you men pull him up with a
jerk so he immediately swings high from the floor.
"Thus there is no pain. As he swings free, note the
convulsions through which he goes. A condemned man is
allowed to hang five minutes after he is dead. Abu will
hang for fifteen! We will then cut him down.
"If he can answer through Madame Fitzhugh, all the
three hundred questions asked in the fifteen minutes, well
and good. If not, return tomorrow. If the questions
asked are too personal, private readings can be had here
late tonight or tomorrow morning at ten o'clock. The
fee is ten dollars per question."
Turning to Abu, Fitzhugh said :
"Are you ready to commit yourself to the spirits?"
A tap of Abu's foot !
"Shall we proceed?"
A tap of Abu's foot !
Taking the rope between his hands the medium spread
the assistants out behind him, each holding part of the
rope. The five men resembled a tug of war team.
"Pull!" cried the medium.
With a heave the men yanked !
The body flew high in the air. It swung and contorted!
The black masked figure was hung!
The reaction on the onlookers was tremendous. A
woman screamed. Another giggled hysterically.
The audience's comments were getting louder and

louder. They saw what they had come to see—yet pro
tested.
They were watching something unreal, uncanny, un
believable, this hanging of a fellow being.
Fitzhugh stopped the commotion with an uplifted
hand.
"Quiet friends," he commanded. "What would mean
another's death is but Abu's ascendency to the spirits."
Slowly the audience became calm. Madame Fitzhugh
stepped forward beside her husband. She smiled, but the
green shadows cast by the sun had made her entire
appearance fearsome and her grin ghastly and malignant.
"Madame Fitzhugh will compose herself in the shadow
of the gallows," the medium continued, "and will begin
to answer all the questions as quickly as possible."
Suiting the action to the word Madame Fitzhugh
picked up a chair and placed it beneath the swinging body.
"Lights," she cried.
The entire auditorium was darkened momentarily and
in place of the sickish, uncanny green lights came a bril
liant soft illumination such as only can be given by the
large white-blue Mazda lamps.
Quickly the medium answered question after ques
tion. For more than the allotted fifteen minutes she called
out answers to questions that the audience had written
on the paper, folded and hidden.
In between answers every now and then the medium
called attention to the body hung in the air above her.
She repeated time and time again that Abu was getting
both questions and answers through the aid of the spirits
and she in turn, because she was closely attuned mentally
to the Burmese, was transmitting them.

Suddenly she stopped answering questions. She walked
to the front of the platform and stated :
"There will be no more public readings tonight. If
any one did not get an answer to the question asked, come
again tomorrow. However, if you did receive an answer,
and want more details, Abu, Prof. Fitzhugh and myself
for a very small fee, only ten dollars, will give you a
private reading after the curtain falls, or in the morning
after ten o'clock.
"Now we will have the green lights of jade fall again,
and visibly bring back to you the man who can not die,
the man you saw hung —yet whom you will see alive
again, here before your very eyes.
"Lights !"
Again the platform was dark for a second and again
the green hues took the place of the white lights.
Crossing to where the rope was fastened to the gal
lows Fitzhugh loosened the knots. Holding the rope
tightly he slowly walked toward the swinging body. As
the slack was played out, the black masked figure slowly
fell to the floor.
The audience was gasping. Half of the women were
breathless with pent up emotions, some were hysterically
standing up in their seats, others were laughing nerv
ously, proclaiming "it's a fake." Men were uncertain
what to do.
Both mediums leaned over the figure and Fitzhugh
slowly drew off the black mask. Madame Fitzhugh took
the head of the "hung" man on her lap and began wash
ing his face with cold water as Fitzhugh slid the noose
from about Abu's neck.
The Burmese laid motionless and white. Slowly as

his face, the color returned. He moved, half rose and
then fell back. The audience was breathless. Again Abu
partly rose from the floor. He seemed to fall back, but
steadied himself and with the aid of both mediums
stood up.
Shaking and rolling his head, even as a dog throws off
water after it has been swimming, the Burmese walked
to the center of the platform. A storm of applause which
made the very rafters of the auditorium ring, went up.
The audience had seen a man hung, and then come back

Bowing again and again, as the ovation died down,
Abu repeated the announcement of Madame Fitzhugh
that there would be private readings immediately follow
ing the fall of the curtain.
II
In the crowd was Charles Prettyman, a journeyman
carpenter, and his wife Alice. No longer young, they had
felt the lack of steady work, for the more youthful and
stronger carpenters were getting first call on the few
construction jobs in town. And the promise of the "friend
of the dead" to find work for him was too great a lure
to keep them away.
The Prettymans were old residents, owned "quite a
piece of property north of town" and had almost twenty
thousand dollars in the Building and Loan, both of which
facts gave them a feeling of being substantial citizens.
But the dearth of steady work worried them, for they
were frugal by nature and hated to touch any of their
savings.
It so happened that one of the questions that Madame

Fitzhugh answered was one Prettyman wrote, "Will
there be a renewal of building here soon?"
The medium replied, "There will be considerable
building here shortly. In particular there is one develop
ment that will be under way soon in which you can
partake."
This answer whetted the appetite of the carpenter
and his wife and we find them in the crowds that waited
after the audience filed out. Almost one hundred men and
women wanted "private readings" and when Madame
Fitzhugh stated "please move down front, we will take
you in order," the rush resembled a football game.
On one side of the platform sat Abu, in the center
was Madame Fitzhugh and to the right the professor.
A short stairway was placed in the middle of the audi
torium by using the two side passageways. The three
mediums rapidly went through the reception ceremonies,
which, of course, included the acceptance of ten dollars
from all those who wished questions answered.
When it finally came to Prettyman's turn, he was sent
to Madame Fitzhugh's table. Here, behind a screen, the
medium asked for details of what bothered him.
"I want to know more about that development you
mentioned in answer to my question about when building
will be resumed here. I can use some of the carpenter
work."
Adroit questioning brought out the details of the finan
cial affairs of the carpenter's family and an appointment
was made for the morrow when Prof. Fitzhugh and Abu
himself would call at the Prettyman home.
Ten o'clock in the morning found the Burmese and
the medium at Prettyman's. They were welcome even
as a farmer welcomes rain after a dry spell.

Ushered into the parlor the mediums decided, after
hearing more details of the Prettyman's property hold
ings to hold a seance then and now.
The usual slate manipulations (explained in previous
chapters) proved the spirits were in favor of the Pretty-
man family's fortunes doubling, and fully half an hour
was spent further pointing out the friendliness of "the
man who can not die" to the carpenter.
Prettyman needed little conversion or proof of the
supernatural powers of the mediums, for hadn't he seen
Abu die only last evening —and hadn't he seen him re
stored to life?
To make a long story short, Prettyman assigned ten
thousand dollars of his Building and Loan Stock to Fitz-
hugh as an investment in a new building development
soon to be started in town—and this development was
to consist of hundreds of homes erected for the followers
of Spiritualism.
Abu said he intended to make the home of his follow
ers in town, erecting a huge cult Temple, and that to
show his appreciation of Prettyman's good faith, he
would sign a contract at once giving him the contractor's
work for all carpentry to be done on the Temple, as well
as the homes in the new development.
Little over a week went by when Prettyman was called
by the president of the Building and Loan to explain that
while the transfer of the stock to Fitzhugh had been
made, the situation should be looked into. More than
thirty people had done likewise, he said.
Prettyman met with dozens of others in the Building
and Loan offices. Also present were the district attorney
and chief of police.

gathering returned empty handed. The total loss in
Middleboro was $i 10,000.
Later developments indicate that the "mediums" were
nothing but three clever crooks and "confidence workers"
who had been discharged from a circus for crookedness.
Thousands and thousands of dollars had been stolen by
this "man who can not die" and his accomplices, re
ports said. At this writing warrants were out for them
in many states, but the trio seemed to have dropped
out of existence.
Ill
There is no question but that every reader is exclaim
ing "He was hung. Why didn't he die?"
The English vocabulary can not describe the sim
plicity of the hanging—nor the genius of the brain that
devised this diabolical means of impressing the credulous
and gullible.
Not the illustration on page 273. The rope and gal
lows are absolutely the same as those used by hangmen
in executions —but in the noose and black mask lies the
secret. And only a few lines are needed to give away the
whole fraud!
When the black mask was put on Abu's head, if you
recall, he raised his hands inside the cloth covering, as
though to straighten out the noose. He did this —but
when he put his right hand up, he took from a hidden
pocket in the mask an apparatus known in circus par
lance as a "tooth-bit." A "tooth-bit" is that piece of hard
rubber and metal clip circus acrobats use in their mouths
when doing "Flying Butterfly" acts. You have seen such
performances hundreds of times, no doubt.
Abu, former circus performer, placed the "tooth-bit"

in his mouth, moved the noose over from behind his ear,
inserted the metal clip attached to the mouth piece deeply
in between the strands of the rope, and all was ready
for him to be "hung!"
His cue to be ready to be swung off the ground was the
second question asked. The tap of his foot was his signal
that he was set.
The tying of his hands and the contortions of the body
were all for effect. Just as you've seen a circus performer
swing when he was suspended only by his teeth holding
him from being dashed to the ground, so did Abu swing
—except you couldn't see the neck "tooth-bit."
You may say "No circus performer ever hung that
long in air suspended only by his teeth." You are
right. Neither did Abu !
If you recall when Madame Fitzhugh changed the
lights from green to white, there was a moment when the
house was dark. In that moment, Abu was swung back of
the black background and a dummy with legs of wax
painted exactly to resemble Abu, was swung back in his
place ! Abu swung by his teeth hardly more than three
minutes, an easy length of time for a trained acrobat.
When at the end of the question answering program
the lights were changed back to green from white, again
there was a moment's solid darkness. That was when
Abu was swung back.
The bathing of his face and his "weakness after the
ordeal" was nothing but showmanship.
Now that you know how Abu was "hung" perhaps
you'd like to know how the questions were known to the
trickers. Recall that the paper was never in the hands
of the fake mediums. Remember that they never touched
or saw the questions —yet they gave the answers. Phe

"like to be fooled."
The wood clip file was not as innocuous as it looked.
If a medium hands you a very unsuspicious looking de
vice, keep in mind that the more innocent it appears, the
more apt it is to be "phoney."
FRONT SIDE
Such was the case with the clip file. Note the illustra
tions on this page. The bottom of the board was solid
oak and the clip at the top was real metal, but there the
genuine materials ceased.

wish to make one) is as follows:

Buy a regular clip board at any stationery store. Take
it to a carpenter and explain you want him to duplicate
it exactly, except that he should leave a yi inch hollow
space all around. To fit this, he should make a frame that
is absolutely tight, no edges where it joins the main piece
to be seen. That ends the carpenter's work.
Buy a sheet of oak-colored wood grain paper. Then
paste this over the frame.
In the base lay a piece of twenty pound white bond
paper. On top of this place a piece of "Pencil Ditto
Paper" or any good heavy carbon paper that makes an
impression no matter how lightly it is touched.
Place the frame with the wood-grained paper in place
over the carbon and bond paper. This will make an abso
lutely "solid wood appearance when correctly done."
One more preparation and you are finished. On the
original clip board you bought for a sample, you will
probably find a label of either the manufacturers or the
stationer from whom you bought it. Soak this off care
fully with warm water. Paste it on the imitation board to
"prove" your board is genuine by innuendo.
When the ordinary paper is placed under the clip, you
are ready to be a "mind reader." When the victim of the
stunt writes, obviously everything he or she writes goes
through the wood-grained paper into the carbon and then
on the white bond paper.
After the questions are written and kept by the dupe,
all you have to do is to innocently take back the board
Carelessly throw it to one side and proceed to talk on
any subject you wish to "stall" for them.
While this is going on, a friend who acts as an assist
ant takes the board to another room, pries up the frame
of the false bottom, and takes out the carbon paper. He

then reads the carbon impression of the question on the
concealed bond paper.
All that now remains is for the assistant to copy the
questions on a very small piece of paper, and innocently
saunter back into the room where you are posing as a
"mind reader." When he gets close to you, stop talking
and drop your handkerchief on the floor. The assistant
stoops and picks it up and returns it to you. When he
hands you the handkerchief he also hands you the piece
of paper on which he has copied the questions.
With the questions in your possession, mop your brow
with the handkerchief and with one hand open the paper
on which the assistant has written. You thus read the
questions ; every time you mop your brow you are reading
another question. It is impossible to be caught at this if
you are careful.
The clip board method of getting messages, years ago
a legitimate stage mind reader's effect, was stolen by
fraudulent spirit mediums and fortune tellers, but is no
longer used by magicians. It is one of the most common
methods in use today by "Spook Crooks." Thousands of
people have been fooled and defrauded by this method.
After obtaining the questions, any answers suffice —
guesses please the populace, as long as they are so
worded the victim can read 'the truth' in them.
The Fitzhughs, obtaining the questions in this fashion,
delivered the answers "from the spirits" without further
ado. Abu was only part of a picture —his "death" and
"return to life" being but showmanship to put a "punch"
in an old, old stunt of frauds.

CHAPTER XIV
THE DEAD CAN NOT SPEAK
"And I solemnly charge you jurors to disregard any tes
timony relative to the corpse returning to life, or any
trickery which may have given that effect, but merely to
decide if the document said to be the last will and testa
ment of George Boss is just that, and if you settle that
it be, if it were obtained through fraud or undue influ
ence, or not."
As the jurors filed out of the little court room in a
New England state and Judge Harry Andrews left the
bench, a buzz of conversation swept the' chambers of jus
tice, for the trial involved the will of the late hardware
manufacturer in which the $375,000 estate, left the
widow, was at stake.
It was protested that the will was executed under
duress, and signed by fraud.
While waiting for the jurors to return with their ver
dict, let us review the testimony in which the question
"the dead can not return to life" was disregarded by the
judge in his charge to the jury, and explain one of the
most unique settings ever used by fraudulent Spiritual
ists, as well as the events leading up to the trial.
Some eighty years ago to Abner and Abigail Boss was
born a son, George. The Revolutionary lineage was thus
to be continued. "For nigh on to seventy years" before
George arrived, the Boss family had tilled the soil and
were as much a part of Hillsboro as the very ground

itself, and the new heir was welcomed with New England
hospitality.
George was shrewd and by the time he was twenty-
six, after clerking in the general store, he made a deal
with the local blacksmith, to sell "fixings" to the farm
ers. Today we call those "fixings" hardware. After his
parents died he disposed of all the realty holdings and
opened a store of his own. He married at forty and had
one son George, Jr.
From then on, with the trend more and more to
"boughten things" rather than the home made ones,
George flourished. His store grew larger and soon there
was a factory which he had erected. With the Spanish
American War came his first real wealth, for he made
bayonets. Then the World War and his little factory
blossomed out to a big one.
But the World War brought him sorrow that even
his love of money could not conquer —George, Jr. was
killed in France and on the day that the fateful envelope
arrived from the War Department with the star above
the address, George Sr. was 67 years old.
Now that you have this background, let the tale of
"the living dead" begin.
Boss erected a wonderful drinking fountain in the
town square to the memory of his son. The town sor
rowed with him until the story of the lonely rich
widower, who was lavishing his money in memory of
his boy, reached an "Inner Circle" of Spiritualists in
Boston. Circular after circular filled the old man's mail,
for while his years were but 67, since his boy's death
he was aging rapidly.
At first he paid little attention to the stories of com

munication between the living and the dead, but as drops
of water wash any granite, so did these tales affect him.
Unknown to his associates, or his friends, two years
after his boy's death he went to Boston and attended
a seance. He was (he thought) unknown to any of
the people present but the medium, a Madam Hunter,
brought him a message "direct from some youngish man
I see in uniform somewhere in France."
Boss was impressed and continued to attend the
seances for many years which were without spirit mani
festation or the actual bringing of the "body" of the
ghost of the room. Always the medium had a message
from his son. Finally, late in 1928, eight years after he
had been "converted" to spiritualism, Boss invited the
entire staff of the "church" to his backhills home.
The mediums were introduced to every one in town
worthwhile, and some not so worthwhile, for Boss was
trying to convert the entire little village to his new re
ligion. The ministers were up in arms over the invasion
of "interlopers" as they called the mediums, but to no
good, for Boss' word was law in many quarters. He held
too many mortgages not to be catered to.
In June of 1928, when he was 78 years old, a demure
little widow was introduced to him. Madam Hunter
presented her as Alice Carey from New Hampshire, a
sincere believer in spiritualism and also one in whose
presence "the ghosts were pleased to come." As Boss had
been begging Madam Hunter to bring his boy to him for
many years, the very fact that Mrs. Carey was one to
whom the spirits would come made her a welcome addi
tion to the circle that gathered at his home for seances.
Mrs. Carey moved into the Boss menage and immedi
ately began to cater to the old man. She made herself

almost indispensable when one evening she felt an "urge."
The spirits were about to appear, maybe even George
would come, she said.
A hurried message to Madam Hunter and the few in
the "circle" and soon the front room of Boss' home was
filled with the believers. The medium arranged that a
screen be placed about one corner of the room and a
chair be placed in it. Then directly in front of the screen
she arranged the chairs in which the others should sit.
"I must be tied to the chair," the medium said, "so
that the spirits will know I am secure and cannot harm
them. Being tied will also convince you that the spirit, if
it comes, is truly a spirit and not a trick."
Boss protested he knew it would not be a trick, but the
medium insisted. So she was carefully tied to the chair,
and the screen placed about it. The lights were all care
fully extinguished. The room was in almost complete
darkness.
Boss seated directly before the screen began to tremble
as though he had the ague. Mrs. Carey petted his hand
several times and finally held it. Like two school chil
dren this couple, one well past middle age, the other
almost senile were holding hands.
Intense silence and darkness. A moan from behind the
screen. A groan and a strange flashing light, as though
it were the Star of Bethlehem, appeared directly above
the screen. The star vanished in mid air and a strange
crescent shaped design took its place. That vanished and
there came a cross in its place.
The air above the cabinet was filled with alternately
flashing lights. The spirits were coming, Mrs. Carey
murmured, as she pressed the old man's hand harder
and harder.

Spook Crooks!
The screen fell with a crash ! The lights vanished and
in their place was a shadowy figure of a soldier in uni
form.
Boss cried:
"My boy, my son."
Overcome by emotion he stared at the apparition
which came slowly toward him.
Boss stretched his hands to embrace the spirit of his
boy, but Mrs. Carey restrained him.
"Don't touch him, he'll vanish," she hissed.
Boss leaned back in his chair. He dreaded to touch the
spirit for he wanted his boy to stay with him always but
how he longed to embrace him ! The figure stood before
him. A green ghastly, ghostly light illuminated his fea
tures. It spoke:
"My father, I come from Spirit Land to see you.
Many times when I was sending you messages I wanted
to pierce the veil and come to you, but there never was
any one present with power enough to bring me to the
Earth Vale. I go now, but will return."
The spirit vanished. It was gone. In the dim light the
screen was soon replaced. Mrs. Carey turned to Boss
and exclaimed :
"Oh, I am so happy your boy came to you, I do hope
that something like this will happen every night."
As she finished speaking the lights were turned on and
it was seen that the screen was in place again and as it
was taken away, it was also noted that the medium was
still securely tied.
The ties were cut and Madam Hunter rose from the
chair in apparently the most weakened condition. She
staggered and asked for a drink of water. This brought,

she regained some of her strength and asked if George
had come while she was in her trance.
George came again on several nights, and Boss was
the happiest man in town. He gave lavish gifts to
Madam Hunter and others of her "Inner Circle." He
and Mrs. Carey were seen in each other's company con
stantly and it surprised no one when in the early part of
1930 they were married.
Mr. and Mrs. Boss were certainly happy together.
They took a honeymoon trip together with Madam
Hunter and a Prof. Hoffman, the medium's helper, as
their guests. On the trip many seances were held and
Boss tried to convert all those with whom he came in
contact.
The second day after their return home, Madam
Hunter said that she had an odd premonition and sug
gested Boss make his will. This was done. All went well
until early last year Boss was taken ill and died suddenly.
His body was taken to the town undertaker and Mrs.
Boss, nee Alice Carey, was most inconsolable.
For two days he lay in the undertaking parlors and
then was brought home for the funeral, at the widow's
request. In the meantime Mrs. Boss was approached by
Madam Hunter, who wanted the newly made widow to
sign an agreement that one-half the estate that would
be left her be given to her spiritualistic friends.
Mrs. Boss was amazed, for while she had been a con
federate of the fake medium in many of her seances to
impress the old man, she had grown to genuinely love
him.
Instead of Madam Hunter being incensed, she asked:
"If through my powers of communication with the
dead, Mr. Boss himself returns to life to tell you how to

use the money left you, will you then give me half? I
do not want this money for myself, but for the cause."
Mrs. Boss was a genuine believer in spiritualism, and
in Madam Hunter's powers. When she worked with the
fake medium she had done so to "further the cause of
the religion" and had no idea of helping defraud the old
man whom she later married.
"Yes," the widow agreed. "If George returns to me,
whatever he tells me to do I will do."
The medium departed promising to meet Mrs. Boss
that evening after the body was brought to the home
from whence it was to go to its last resting place.
At ten o'clock that evening Prof. Hoffman and Madam
Hunter arrived. Boss was reposing in the beautiful coffin
with a benign expression on his face, when Alice and
the two mediums entered the parlor. Telling the paid
watcher to leave the body, Madam Hunter bent on her
knees before the coffin, rapped on it twice and prayed.
"Oh, Great Benefactor, whose flesh is to return to the
dust from whence it came, but whose soul and spirit will
live forever, return if Thou wilt to this Earth Plane in
your own body and speak to us all on the subject of what
to do with the earthly wealth thou didst leave behind."
The medium had hardly stopped speaking when the
body half rose in the coffin, the head coming out of the
half-open casket. It spoke:
"Alice, make me a promise!"
The widow screamed.
"Yes, I promise anything of my husband, but only
stay with me."
The corpse continued to speak.
"I am now the living proof that the dead do return.
But I can not linger. I must return to the Other World,

but before I start on my last journey, I want you to
promise that one half of whatever I have left you will
be given to the cause of Madam Hunter. Do you so
promise ?"
"Yes," weakly affirmed Alice.
"Good-by, then, forever, my dear. I will return again
in spirit but never in person."
The corpse gave a gasp and fell back motionless.
Alice fainted and Madam Hunter and Prof. Hoffman
carried her to her room.
After the funeral was over Alice repaired at once to
Seth Burns, the attorney who handled all the affairs of
the departed. Here the will was read to her and despite
the protests of the lawyer that the corpse could not have
spoken, one half was assigned at once to Madam Hunter.
A few days after the funeral and the settling of the
estate Ed Boss, only relative of the dead man came to
town. He saw Burns who told him about the admission
of the will to probate and the instant conversion of the
funds into cash that followed the probate action.
Suit was brought at once, first to determine the validity
of the will; and secondly, to recover the funds.
Madam Hunter had vanished when Burns issued a
summons for her as a witness, but Mrs. Boss was on
hand for the trial.
The first two days of the suit were taken up by attacks
on Mrs. Boss' motives in marrying and her giving the
medium half the estate. The next day was devoted to
proving the will was signed under fraudulent circum
stances and various witnesses introduced, who could tell
the truth about the various appearances of the deceased
man's son.

Boston who stated on the witness stand that he had been
hired by Madam Hunter. His testimony:
"A Madam Hunter came to a small club booking
agency and wanted a young experienced actor. She did
not state what she wanted him for until after the papers
were signed. She then doubled the amount I was to get
and explained that Mr. Boss was nearing death, and to
make him happy, she wanted to have his son appear
before him again.
"I had a picture of him in uniform and if I admit it
myself, I am pretty good at make-up. So I fixed myself
up to look like Mrs. Boss' son and said my lines just as
if I were an actor on the stage. I did this on six nights.
After the last performance, if I may call it that, I went
back to Boston with $500. It was the easiest money T
ever had made for a week's work."
On cross examination, instead of helping the plaintiff's
case, this transpired:
"Did you know you were deluding an old man ?"
"Not in the accepted sense of the word. I thought I
was making him happy."
"Did you, when you met Mrs. Carey, who later was to
become Mrs. Boss, know that she was in the plot?"
"There was no plot and when I met the then Mrs.
Carey I was impressed with her sincere love for the old
gentleman."
When Farley was dismissed from the stand, Mrs. Boss
was called.
"When this corpse came back to life as you say he did,
did you believe it was your husband?"
"Not alone did I believe it then, but I believe it now."
"Even though you know now that it was all a fraud?"
"I don't know it was a fraud even now. Nothing has

about Mr. Farley acting as Mr. Boss' son."
A shout threw the courtroom in turmoil. Prof. Hoff
man came rushing down the aisle. Running to Ed Boss
and his attorney, pushing court attendants away, he
began whispering.
Randolph rose.
"If it please the court," he started, "I want to ask
permission to stop the cross examination of Mrs. Boss
at this stage of the trial and to place Prof. Hoffman on
the stand, retaining the right to call Mrs. Boss again
after Prof. Hoffman is finished testifying."
"Granted."
"Thank you, your honor. Prof. Hoffman, please take
the stand."
After Hoffman was sworn in, the various preliminary
questions asked, Randolph proceeded:
"You were one of the conspirators against Mr. Boss,
is that not so?"
"Not a conspirator, merely a dupe of Madam
Hunter."
"We'll admit the correction. Did Madam Hunter
promise, if you would help her, to give you half of what
ever she got?"
"Yes, but . . ."
"Your honor I object to this testimony," Mrs. Boss'
attorney interposed. "It has nothing to do with the point
in question, 'is the will already admitted to probate
valid.'
"
Arguments proceeded for half an hour when Randolph
changed his type of questioning.
"You came here of your own free will to testify about
the fraud perpetrated on Mr. Boss?"

"Not on Mr. Boss, on Mrs. Boss!"
"What!"
The courtroom was a seething cauldron of excitement.
Order restored, Randolph again proceeded.
"I did not get that. Mrs. Boss was imposed on, you
say?"
"Yes, sir. Madam Hunter figured that Mrs. Boss was
not going to be the meal ticket for her that the old man
had been and framed up to so impress her with her
powers of bringing the dead to life, that she pulled a
trick on her. She. . . ."
"If the court pleases," Randolph stated, "I will like
to state that it is my firm belief that Mrs. Boss herself
was imposed upon by this missing witness, Madam
Hunter, but as that does not affect our case in my
opinion, I will permit the witness to tell his story in
detail.
"Mr. Hoffman, explain to the court the deception
used on Mrs. Boss."
"Well," Hoffman took up the thread of his story,
"When the body came to the parlor from the undertaker
in the casket, we had planted an actor in the coffin,
underneath the dead man."
Hoffman had to stop. The noise of the comments in
the crowded courtroom became too great. Quieted again
he proceeded:
"We had strapped this actor, not Mr. Farley, but a

neath the body in this fashion (see illustration on page

for him, it was easy money, for Madam Hunter paid

The judge then delivered his charge. The jury filed
back into the room. Judge Andrews returned to the
bench.
The verdict was in favor of Mrs. Boss, all agreeing
she was more sinned against than sinning.
Ed Boss came to the side of his dead uncle's wife. For
the first time he spoke to her since his appearance in
town some days before.
"Aunt," he said, "I am sorry for you. I am sorry I
started this suit. I don't want a cent of Uncle George's
money, but I do want to run these criminals to earth."
But his aunt shook her head.
"No, my boy," she told him. "They were not crimi
nals. They were misguided spiritualists. I still believe in
spiritualism."
Mrs. Boss today is still living in the house to which
the old man brought her as a bride. Ed is managing her
affairs, but can't control her beliefs despite the frightful
experience she went through.
And "somewhere in France," Madam Hunter resides
with almost $200,000, her half of the $375,000 estate,
untouched by the law, but probably her conscience is
bothering her.

CHAPTER XV
THE SPIRIT TELEPHONE
Electricity and hidden telephones, microphones and
other modern inventions play a great part in fooling the
credulous and superstitious. Here is an example —an ex
pensive lesson !
James Seed had worked hard all his life and accumu
lated almost a million dollars when he decided to retire
from the business world and live out his life in a secluded
little village in New England. He became practically a
recluse, although his mansion was the show place of the
town, until he met a group of alleged Spiritualists.
He was a widower, but deeply in love with a divorcee,
Mrs. Dorothy Devoe, whom he had met at a spiritual
istic seance in Florida, where he had passed a winter to
escape the rigors of New England.
He was quite sure that Dorothy loved him, despite
the fact he was nearing eighty, and she was hardly thirty.
He invited her, together with several members of the
"church" to spend the summer of 1929 with him, and all
accepted.
Many seances were held in the Seed home, and mes
sages were brought daily to the old man from his father
and mother "in spirit." Let us look in on one of the
many of these seances.
A high ceilinged old fashioned parlor with its century
old oak floors, the high back red plush chairs, all were

as traditions of New England demand. Camp chairs, of
the type undertakers might furnish, were the only mod
ern influence in the room.
Grouped about a heavy round table were seven people.
At the head sat Mr. Seed; to his right was Mrs. Devoe;
and elsewhere were Dr. Jack Emory, a spiritualistic min
ister; Albert Roberten, a nephew of Mrs. Devoe; and
three others. The only lights in the room were four dimly
lit kerosene lamps.
Mr. Seed sat with bowed head as Dr. Emory mur
mured a prayer and the rest of the little circle whispered
"Amen." Truly, it was a religious gathering.
"Today, my dearly beloved," Dr. Emory stated, "we
are gathered to see if the messages that came from the
other world, on the slates that Mr. Seed gave us yes
terday, can be received again, and this time verbally. I
have here a telephone complete with receiver and mouth
piece. Obviously there are no wires attached, for I move
it about freely."
"Mr. Seed, let me hand you this telephone."
The old gentleman took the telephone in his hand and
examined it curiously. It was the regular telephone appa
ratus, to all appearances without wires and devoid of any
connections. With an air of amazement, he said :
"There certainly are no wires or attachments on this
phone. What is it for?"
The gasp of astonishment from Mr. Seed and Mrs.
Devoe was audible when Dr. Emory quietly said :
"If you, Mr. Seed, will speak into this telephone, after
I have gone in a trance, and ask for a connection with
your mother and father in spirit land, they will actually
answer you. For you hold a true 'Spirit Telephone.'
"

heaven with this spirit telephone?" slowly asked Seed.
"That all I have to do is to ask questions and my parents
will answer them ? It's impossible !"
"Nothing is impossible to the spirits," was the quiet
reply.
Dr. Emory asked for silence, and his head fell for
ward on his chest as he went into the trance. The silence
was intense. Seed kept tight grip on the telephone,
receiver clasped to his ear, mouthpiece close to his face.
The medium spoke, without inflection, in a low tone.
"Spirits, who watch over all mortals, today I bring to
you the believer with whom we have been conversing for
the past weeks. In his hands is the telephone through
which you promised me his mother and father would
talk. Will you answer any questions that he asks?"
The room was deathly still for a moment. Seed's hands
were trembling.
"YES."
Clear and loud from the spirit telephone without wires
or connections, came the answer !
The old man was pathetically excited.
"Thank you spirits," the medium intoned. "Now let
the questioning begin."
In a voice that trembled, Seed asked:
"Can you hear me, Mother?"
"Yes, son," came back the answer in a crackling voice
through the telephone.
"Oh, Mother, I am so happy to talk with you. Tell me
if Father is with you, and if you are both well and happy
in spirit land."
"We are together, and we both are very happy. I am
thankful that I can talk with you."
For several minutes the strange conversation went on.

Both Father and Mother spoke to the old man, whose
elation was growing steadily, and whose fear and dread
was vanishing.
Suddenly in the midst of an answer through the spirit
telephone, the medium groaned and moaned as though
in pain.
"I can not hold the trance much longer," he said.
"Please make arrangements for another seance."
"I must go, Mother mine, for the medium who is
helping us commune, is feeling the strain," Seed said into
the spirit telephone. "Have you any parting message,
dear?"
"Only one," came the voice through the telephone.
"Marry Dorothy. She loves you and you love herl"
Seed was startled, tried to say something but the line
was dead. No answer came.
The medium moaned and groaned constantly. Sud
denly he seemed to awaken. Dorothy had walked over to
the old man's side and hand in hand the young divorcee
and the old gentleman were watching him as he asked
what had happened.
Both outlined the communications from the spirit
world and the medium was most pleased.
"This is the greatest advance in spirit communication
in years," he said. "We'll have to publish this seance and
its results to the world."
"Regarding your marriage, I've known for a long time
something like this would happen. I am so happy for you
both. If you'll get a license I'll be glad to perform the
ceremony."
The following day the old multi-millionaire and the
young matron were married. It was a wonderful wed

ding ceremony. As the words "I pronounce you man and
wife" were said, the lights seemed to flicker and from
the midst of a huge vase of flowers, which stood on the
side of the room, came the words :
"The spirits bless your union!"
The guests were startled, but the believers were made
most happy by the words. It proved that the spirits were
watching over the couple.
Time went on. More and more messages came over
the spirit telephone, and Seed was enjoying life as never
before.
However, the over excitement of the spirit commu
nications and his marriage to the young woman proved
too much for the old man, and his health broke down.
He took to bed, and three days after he had first com
plained of not feeling well, he was dead.
His will left all to his bride and, in the midst of death,
there was rejoicing, for the estate consisted of over
$700,000 in cash and gold bonds. The new Mrs. Seed,
who was so quickly widowed, and the spiritualists who
had been her friends, danced in the midst of what should
have been sorrowing for, dear reader, it had all been
a huge conspiracy to get the old man's money.
And these facts would never have been known if a
fight had not been started by Seed's only blood relatives,
a niece and nephew, when the will had been offered for
a probate.
Charging "fraudulent conspiracy" against the widow
and "Dr. Emory," who was said to have been a con
victed fortune teller, the battle raged for days in the
courts.
Let us quote part of a press association story:

"Interesting sidelights on the spiritualistic 'racket' were thrown
in Probate Court here today when Albert Roberten, of Eighth
Street, nephew of Mrs. Dorothy Devoe Seed, testified in the
contest of the will of the late James Seed, an eccentric recluse
of Springfield, which bequeathed Seed's entire estate to his wife,
the former Mrs. Dorothy Devoe.
"Robcrten's aunt wept when he took the stand to testify in
behalf of Mrs. Ethel Edward and George Seed, a niece and
nephew of Seed, who are contesting the will. It was brought out
later that Roberten was to receive not more than $25,000 from
them, if the contestants break the will, or receive a substantial
settlement.
"Counsel for the contestants said that they expect to show
through Roberten and others that James Seed had been the vic
tim of a fraudulent conspiracy on the part of his wife, the former
Mrs. Devoe and other persons, when he married her, the object
of the conspiracy having been to obtain his estate.
"Seed was led to believe, the testimony indicated, that he was
receiving messages from his dead mother and father urging him
to marry Mrs. Devoe, trust her fully and give her his property.
"Roberten, who was a party to many of the seances, told Judge
Joseph Walters, that the messages were all prepared in advance
by the gang and transmitted to Seed by trickery.
"Questions to the departed mother and father, written by Seed,
were spirited by sleight of hand from before his eyes, and other
envelopes substituted, and the answers to them were written by
one of the gang on a blackboard, so placed in another room, that
only the medium—usually the present Mrs. James Seed—could
see them.
"One of the most impressive tricks according to the testimony,
was the use of a "spirit telephone" through which communication
with the dead was said to be possible. This device, a radio appli
ance, was used, it was said, to encourage the old man to marry
Mrs. Devoe. Seed, moved by all these messages from the other
world, finally married the former Mrs. Devoe.
"When his interest seemed to lag, plans were drawn for a great

"James Seed Spiritualist Temple" to be erected on his property
here. When finally the will was executed, giving the entire Seed
estate to Seed's wife, Roberten testified there was great rejoicing
among the spiritualist gang in their apartment in New York.
"Roberten identified some of the members of the gang as
Harris Potter, also known as Prof. Ray; Morris Janes; Daisy
Katz; and "Dr." Jack Emory, who was the "minister" in the
alleged conspiracy. Emory apparently was the brains of the gang."
The impressive spirit telephone was nothing but a
clever adoption of well known radio principles. There
are such nefarious devices made up, ready to be sold to
fortune tellers, spirit mediums, or others who wish them,
by an occult supply house which makes a business of fur
nishing supplies to those who either prey on the public,
or entertain them (as the catalogue states).
Whether a spirit telephone sold by this supply house
mentioned was the one used to defraud Mr. Seed is not
known, for it was not shown in court. But here is the
way a spirit phone works, and if you get a good radio
man, and want to spend the money, he can make one
for you !
(For entertainment purposes only.)
The telephone is a genuine instrument, but the work
ing parts have been taken out, and there has been sub
stituted in the ear piece, a small electro-dynamic receiver
unit, which can be bought from the larger radio supply
houses. In the handle of the telephone proper are four
one and one half volt batteries, which generate the six
volts needed to exert the electric field of the speaker.*
This unit weighs about eighteen ounces and its electric
consumption is i% amperes. Its voice coil impedance is

1
5 ohms with a continuous operating capacity of 5 to 7
watts.
Hidden under the dining room table is a two button
radio microphone made of high carbon steel. It has a fre
quency range of from 35 to 6000 cycles, the buttons are
of 200 ohms resistance each, and because they are rug
gedly built, these microphones eliminate the hissing sound
that some of the smaller ones give off. It is only 1 inch
thick and but two inches in diameter with two small
screw holes at top and bottom. Thus it can readily be
attached. Its weight is only one and one half pounds.
The wires from this concealed microphone run under
neath the rug to another room where a confederate has
the small receiving unit and thus he can hear everything
said in the room where the seance takes place. He has
a microphone in his room also, and broadcasts back the
answers.
When the dupe speaks into the spirit telephone, he
really speaks into the unseen microphone under the table.
Many. times when the victim is more than just two or
three feet from the concealed "mike" the voice is lost and
the confederate in the other room cannot answer.
In such cases, the fake medium is prepared, and starts
extra loud moaning and groaning. He then states that
the question will have to be repeated in a louder tone
as his "control" reports that it "reached the spirits in a
distorted phrasing." Being under tremendous nervous
excitement, the dupe repeats the query and thinks nothing
of the absurdity.
The "spirit telephone" mentioned above as being sold
in an assembled form by a Middle West supply house
operates on a slightly different method, inasmuch as in
that one the telephone proper houses a microphone

device. On both the telephones, one may assemble the
telephone wires between receiver and mouth piece to act
as a miniature aerial.
Fakers are up to the minute. Before the advent of
radio, when the desire of the bereaved to bring voices
from the spirits was as pronounced as at present, a con
federate would be stationed behind a false wall. Through
a speaking tube, such as the deaf use, the voices would
project into the room with the medium and his dupes.
No matter how new an invention, no matter how far
fetched it may be, remember that some fortune telling
faker somewhere, will attempt to use it to defraud you.
And as "you can't beat a man at his own game" the
safest thing you can do is to avoid all fortune tellers
like the plague.

CONCLUSION
And now the book is ended. Not that there are not
hundreds, yes, even thousands of cases which could be
rightfully included, but no book ever printed is large
enough to hold the stories of the damage wrought by
Spook Crooks who, under their smug guise of possessing
supernatural powers, wreck the lives of thousands yearly.
The author hopes that by now the reader realizes
i. Communication between the living and dead is not
yet established, aithough-thcrc have been oomc inexpli
cable phenomena, during seanrea. Genuine and-sincere
spiritualists do not give advice on maxriagft,-tra,yfil< love
affairs, financial matters or business.
u. Futmcs uf Individuals are trot- predictable by any
process.
3. No one possesses supernatural powers. Readingjjf
sealecTmessages is done by material means, not mystic
powers.
4. "Miracles" of fortune tellers, fake spirit mediums,
mimTreaders, etc., are merely the application 6f~sbme
sleight-of-hand, chemical process or unseen manipulation.
5. Astrology, mjmerology, palmistry, tea leaf reading
andThe other pseudo-sciences are false doctrines invented
to impress the credulous and make the operator wealthy.
