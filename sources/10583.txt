I had car accident, when the car was turned upside down. During this I remembered everything in my life, with all the details and very accurately, everything since my birth till the time of accident. I remembered all the people I knew, even the ones whom I met only once or twice. I remembered all the events, the important and non-important ones when my age was less than a year - I remembered it with all its details. It passed in front of me and I saw it as a cinema show in just fifteen minutes. When I got out of the car I was in full consciousness. I felt that I wasn't in the car or in other words I was existing and not existing, a feeling that is difficult to describe. I felt that there is a something to protect people.
