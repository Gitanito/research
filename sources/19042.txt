doctor girl welcome back to the show
thank you I&#39;m very grateful to be back
on short notice and happy birthday today
he&#39;s also president of the group of
companies known as Conte and we have
many members and many associates
associated with and people around the
world listening in who are very
concerned about not only two political
problems but Natural Sciences all the
sciences dr. Greer has been the champion
of the disclosure project issue many of
you know I was a witness in the
disclosure project in May 2001 but he
has also produced amazing videos books
and in relation to something that he
would like to reveal today that is so
relevant you know that I have been
putting steps together to support the
work that I&#39;ve been doing especially in
this most recent trip that was so
amazing in Moscow to support the treaty
on the prevention of the placement of
weapons in outer space each of the shows
that are archived on American Freedom
radio.com add up to a full picture and
this is one of the culmination points
that&#39;s such a good example
each of us can do yes well it&#39;s it&#39;s
gonna be a full show and I think I want
to give an overview of what we&#39;re going
to be covering many of you may have seen
the documentary series that featured
this little creature who was found in
the Atacama Desert of Chile in 2003 and
by a treasure hunter and this was then
subsequently taken to Spain with no
knowledge of ours we were not involved
in that it&#39;s become a big controversy
that it was taken out of out of Chile as
antiquity it is estimated to have lived
around a hundred to a hundred and thirty
years ago in this remote dry desert area
that has a very harsh environment it&#39;s
very hot during the day
extremely cold at night in the winters
called the Atacama Desert and when I
first saw it was in 2009 I was in near
Barcelona doing a presentation to about
2,000 people and someone came up to me
and said there&#39;s a man here who very
much needs to speak to you and I was
shown a photograph of this being I
immediately knew that it was something
unusual and we met I investigated it I
held it personally it fits in my hand at
six inches long so I have my big hands
nevertheless it fit in the palm of my
hand and I was frankly rather astonished
being a medical doctor I&#39;m an emergency
and trauma doctor I&#39;ve seen personally
every kind of human I&#39;ve delivered a
couple
hundred infants and to see something
this small that was so perfect and yet
did not look human it certainly got my
curiosity going but we really weren&#39;t
given access to it medically until about
2012 and in September 2012 I I&#39;m the
principal investigator on this project
who went over there and with some
assistance we got some cat scans x-rays
which we will also show you well we
can&#39;t show the packets show those here
but we have them on our website at
serious disclosure comm so if you want
to see those you just go to serious
disclosure comm and look under the
evidence part and you&#39;ll see there&#39;s a
whole section of the cat scans and
x-rays and photographs of this little
beam so you can look at those as we&#39;re
speaking today what happened is that we
wanted to get some studies on the DNA so
we clipped the anterior right lateral
ribs which by the way this little beam
has ten ribs instead of twelve which is
unusual it has four skull bones instead
of six like humans have all kinds of
anomalies with the skeletal structure
just so you know it also has some fashio
or connective tissue that had dried out
and it was very desiccated and it had
dried out but you could still see where
there was some connective tissue a
cartilaginous type material in the skull
we were able to extract some of them and
engies the lining of the brain and what
have you if there&#39;s no question it&#39;s an
actual organism that had lived out in
the desert at some point and we simply
didn&#39;t know what it was now for the
record because it&#39;s been misrepresented
in the New York Times in the last week
in March 22nd this fraudulent report
came out and I&#39;ll get to that in a
but it&#39;s been wrists misrepresented that
we were calling it an alien if you go
through everything that&#39;s in the Sirius
documentary and everything that I have
ever written and said we have a youtube
video presentation on this that&#39;s had 1
million views already I never called it
an alien or an ET I said it&#39;s unusual
and we do not know what it is and then
we need to have it investigated
independently and thoroughly well around
this time a man named Gary Nolan who is
the Harris chair professor at Stanford
University with a PhD and his focus is
immunology and genetics and
what-have-you and he has dozens of
postdocs who work under him I&#39;ve been in
his lab reached out and he had informed
me that he had had an et contact
experience personally that dr. Nolan had
had contact with ETS and that he was
very interested in the subject and that
he would be happy to be sort of an
honest broker to do the genetic work on
it many people in the last week of said
how did you get mixed up with Stanford
which has SR I and all these other
entities that are connected to covert
government contracting didn&#39;t you know
that they would submarine this I said
well I trusted Gary Nolan to do a good
job because I felt he was sincere and he
had the credentials and he also had the
equipment that&#39;s very very specialized
to do the genetic studies on this
specimen which we knew was quite unusual
well during this time period but we of
course I under forensic sterile field
for example like you would in the
emergency department in a rape kit or a
murder case or stabbing or shooting we
took the evidence and did it under
forensic chain-of-command it never lost
our came out from our control in
possession until it was handed off to
dr. Nolan and Gary took it then into his
lab to do the
genetic research he immediately was very
excited about what he found he found
that there was almost 10% of the genetic
material not matching to humans now
people go well what does that mean a
monkey if you go to your zoo and go look
go look at what a chimpanzee looks like
or a gorilla
they are 98 to 98 and a half percent
identical to humans so this becomes a
very strange now because that is a very
low percentage of matching because you
know I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know that the
specifics but a fruit fly has a large
number of their genes the same as humans
etc and so on a guinea pig has a very
large number of genes the same as humans
so for it to be less matching even if it
was even if it was 98% matching to a
human this would be very very unusual
and so he said well this is something
very anomalous and he had shared this
information with a man who has asked to
be remain anonymous at this time because
of the academic scandal that this has
become now let me be very clear the man
that I am referring to I have checked
his bona fide ease he is that one of the
top geneticists in the world he was
asked to actually work with Watson of
Watson and Crick who and who discovered
the DNA molecule at Cold Spring Harbor
in Long Island and at one point his own
PhD supervisors were Nobel Prize winners
he has a PhD in genetics from Caltech
and literally invented the
crystallography of DNA and has done
pioneering research for decades and is a
man of enormous stature of the DNA field
he contacted me this past Sunday morning
and said this is an academic scandal of
the first order
magnitude and just to give you an idea
of how far off the paper which is in
this journal genome research now this is
one the most prestigious scientific
journals in the world this paper
appeared March 22nd now that is a
peer-reviewed journal now what that
means in America is that it&#39;s supposed
to have gone through the review of
people competent to examine the data and
also to reach any conclusions so that it
could be accepted or not accepted when I
spoke to this world-renowned geneticist
he said first thing out of his mouth was
any peer review of this paper that Nolan
had done would have received a zero
ranking zero grade because he did no
controls he did no proper analysis and
it slipped through and got put in this
prestigious Journal and now it&#39;s been
front-page news on the New York Times
and CNN and BBC and every journal in the
world claiming that this is a deformed
human girl that was an aborted fetus and
that it had seven sudden magical genes
never known before that caused the
deformity now one of the things he wrote
in this we just received in the last
hour from this world renowned geneticist
and I want to read this Nolan says that
the Chilean mummy has lots of random
chance mutations which affected seven
different genes for bone development all
at once if such mutations were really
random as he says then practically every
other gene of similar DNA length would
have been mutated meaning at least 1/4
to 1/2 of the 30,000 genes in the human
genome
quite obviously if this were the case
then the fertilized embryo would never
have been able to divide even once even
an inherited single gene disorder one
gene mutated out of 30,000 can cause
serious developmental problems now this
is dispositive this statement by itself
pretty much shows the complete
incompetence and error of this report
that has now gone all over the world
saying the case is closed on this now I
think that this should be a great
concern even if you&#39;re not interested in
the UFO and ET issue the corruption of
scientific research and the creation
excuse me of junk the creation of junk
science which has begun to come out
through more and where these
peer-reviewed journals has become an
epidemic we have a paper talking about
this from the New Republic where it was
an overview where it said that 14 of the
most important referenced 14 of the 14
most important reference medical papers
in recent times were never made their
way into peer-reviewed journals and were
rejected while there are all these
others that were getting in that were
junk science so there&#39;s something very
seriously wrong in general but in this
case the system broke down completely at
Cold Spring Harbor the birthplace of
Watson and Crick where the DNA molecule
was first discovered and for which of
course they got the Nobel Prize and
their flagship journal genome research
so this should be of concern to any
scientist listening and any layperson
listening needs to be very worried about
this of what does this mean in terms of
the veracity of what we consider truth
coming out of academia and scientific
research now somewhere in that period
between October of 2012 and 2013
normally did
before he had even done all the research
did a 180 turn degree turn and by the
time the serious film came out was said
to the public that it was a deformed
human that even before he had run all
the studies he had reached his
conclusion and this of course caused the
entire release of the film serious to be
not covered in the mainstream media we
had interviews lined up for the view for
Fox News and others and his statement
alone pretty much terminated the release
of that film serious which was part of
the disclosure project effort and I
wondered what in the world is going on
here I knew something terrible had
happened we&#39;ll get to this in a moment
so it&#39;s also important for you people to
understand that at the same time that I
was we were researching this we were
getting the clinical data in now what I
mean by clinical data is dr. Ralph
Lockman who is a professor at Stanford
was asked to do the research on this as
a medical doctor who is taken care of of
many of the syndromes we&#39;re talking
about and doctor lachman&#39;s report which
is also on the website
I&#39;m not seeming to be able to find it
here where I thought it might be but his
report very clearly stated that this was
a six to eight year old child now what
does that mean it means a six to eight
year old child that&#39;s six inches tall
let me repeat this and have been up
walking around anthropologists in Europe
where there was some remaining tissue on
the
Neal had said that this was also a some
sort of creature that had been up and
walking around then we find in this
report from Gary Nolan that they&#39;re
saying that it was a fetus that was
aborted that never touched the earth and
was never up and around so the report in
the journal shows that this is and I
want to show an x-ray a picture of me
holding up this this creature that&#39;s me
holding up and you can see the density
of the bones is so tiny that the whole
beam can be in what would normally be
just a small view of one bone and he
also noted that all the different
abnormalities the fact that it had four
skull bones instead of six the fact that
it had only ten ribs instead of twelve
and yet it was a perfectly symmetrical
beam it was not deformed it was not like
he would if you go in Google you know
dysplasias of the bone and deformations
of the bone it was perfectly symmetrical
and so what we began to realize is that
this was a global situation global
meaning the entire being was different
from a human and in his report which I
have here you can see his signature I
don&#39;t know if you can see all of it and
I&#39;ll expect you to be able to read it
but what he says very clearly it has ten
ribs at six to eight years of age and
that it is you know a genuine specimen
in other words this is not a hoax or a
model or something like that so now this
begins to be more and more worrisome the
the information began to pour in
clinically from around the world of
other creatures like this and I shared
with Nolan that there was one found in
Russia is why I wanted to do this on
your show and the Russian a creature was
look at the hit back of the head of this
one with 1996 and it looked very much
the same in terms of its skeletal
structures structure here&#39;s one that
shows the top of the head almost like a
helmet like structure that you can see
and even to the point that one part
overlaps another and comes to a little
twist or a point and this was noted to
be so similar to the atacama humanoid
that we had get worse with that we got
to genetics on now the story behind this
one was not only given to Gary Nolan one
of his PhD or postdoc students found all
the evidence on the internet for it and
remarked about how much it looked the
same and we have that correspondence
from dr. Nolan to to them so we one of
the things you need to understand about
this it says that the Russian one was
eventually taken by the FSB we need help
in Russia relocating this which had been
the KGB but prior to that it was found
it was had three genetic studies that
were done that showed that it did not
have human genetics however it was later
done by a state lab that declared it was
a female human fetus the same cover
story as you see in the Gary Nolan
report that&#39;s in the human genome it&#39;s
very curious when I read this the other
day I thought how strange that it
started out the same way and it ended
the same way it started out that people
were doing real research on the Russian
creature and ended up being just an
ordinary human that had all these
deformities
now the story behind that is that it&#39;s
an area of Russia where there are a lot
of UFOs seen going in and out of the
mountains and those that area is noted
to be a hotspot and has been for
centuries of UFOs interestingly where
the atacama humanoid was found I just
got this photograph from the Atacama
Desert is also an area that&#39;s noted if
you can see the photograph or not can
you see it yeah this is a daytime disc
classic over the Atacama Desert and so
the native peoples of that area have
both Russia and that Chile now these are
separate continents separate hemispheres
have seen these UFOs and have seen these
small creatures which apparently are
just a little over foot tall when
they&#39;re fully developed the specimen
that we called a de the atacama one was
apparently only a child of six to eight
years or the equivalent in human years
of six to eight years look again at this
the skull and the overlapping bone of
the one in Russia and then if you go
back and you look at the skull structure
if you&#39;re on our website of the one that
we have from the Atacama Desert there&#39;s
a remarkable and they both have four
skull bones whereas humans have six now
dr. Nolan had stated emphatically if
there were two of these anywhere in the
world it would rule out a spontaneous
mutation of a human fetus that if
there&#39;s no way that you&#39;re going to have
two of these that are one in a
quadrillion chance and yet he was given
all of this clinical data and still came
up with a genetic report that has been
accepted by this peer-reviewed journal
that says the case is closed
it&#39;s a deformed human Chilean girl that
was a fetus
well this geneticist who has been doing
this work with us has and his remarks
are somewhere I will get them in a
minute
the geneticist has stated that the and I
just want to emphasize some of these
points that he made when he first
contacted us he says first of all
Nolan&#39;s story has changed completely
since we first discussed the early
results then he was ecstatic that he had
made one of the big history-making
discoveries and this brought despite his
strong interest on that day after that
we never heard from him again
if and he goes on to say if this were my
data and I did the same analysis my
first conclusion after seeing so many
mutations with coding regions including
lots of mutations never before seen in
any medical database this is critical
would be to think most of all that such
mutations took place after the mummy
died in other words they are not
mutations they&#39;re damage to the DNA due
to the 100 to 500 years of environmental
exposure which is unavoidable I would
venture to say that the vast majority of
molecular biologists would consider that
as a primary hypothesis now what Nolan
and his colleagues did next was quite
surprising to say the least they chose
to interpret all of those many extensive
mutations within DNA coding regions as
genetically significant to the mummy
while it was still alive if it were a
fresh modern undamaged sample this might
be reasonable however for a sample which
has been moderately damaged to the
extent described it is not a plausible
hypothesis now what he is saying in this
won&#39;t translate this for you is that we
have a paper from 2005 or 2006 that was
published in a peer-reviewed journal
about what&#39;s called ancient DNA just so
you know ancient DNA does not mean a
mummy from Egypt from 5000 years ago and
this is the paper it
we have tweeted this out because this is
an emergency
of the first order of magnitude of
scientific mint problems and if you look
at the date what does the date say 2005
was when it was the research was done it
was released in 2006 and published now
in this paper it&#39;s very technical it
goes into the fact that when you have
and I&#39;ll just explain this for the
layperson the persons who are not
scientists if something goes out in your
yard and dies and it sits there for a
hundred hundred and thirty-two hundred
years the DNA material will still be in
the bones which is where we got this
material from the bone marrow of the
ribs but because of the fact that it&#39;s
not in a cryogenic lab like you do keep
a human embryo when you know you&#39;re
preserving them in a cryogenic setting
