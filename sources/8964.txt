            		Experience Description:   

I fell through the ice and thereafter slipped underneath it. Slowly my eight years of life experience left me and was transformed into beautiful music and colors. I lost consciousness, which finally returned after three days. I didn't see the music and colors thereafter. A year later the exact same experience repeated itself but I retain very little memory of that one.
