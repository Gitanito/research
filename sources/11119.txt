  		              		Experience Description   

  I was taking a shower and began to feel light-headed. 

  Seconds later, I was floating in the corner of the bathroom.  I could hear a woman screaming in utter panic. I looked down and saw my wife frantically trying to pull my body out of the shower.  She was sobbing and slapping my face, trying to get me to regain consciousness. 

Later, she told me I had must have passed out and hit my head. She had found me on the shower floor.  In desperation she began to pray. She pleaded that I would be alright and that I wouldn't die. I remember I could hear her words but her mouth was not moving.  It was at this moment I realized I was probably dead. 

  I felt peaceful and pain-free. The words she spoke were sorrowful and my heart ached for her. With a whoosh, I felt my self being shoved back into my body. 

  My chest hurt and I started coughing out water. I immediately told my wife what had happened.  She did not believe me. So, I told her the exact words of her prayer.
