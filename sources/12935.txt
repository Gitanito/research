I went through a 'tunnel' that had a very bright white light at the end. As I neared, the light, I could see many people with their arms stretched out beckoning me to come. They appeared as 'grayish' figures, but I could not see their faces. As I got closer, I felt an overwhelming sense of peace beyond any understanding of the word and I wanted to go. Then I heard a male voice that permeated my entire being and it said, 'No! Her children need her.' Then I woke up with my friend shaking me.

A couple years passed, and I found out that my husband, her step-father, had been molesting her. That is when I finally understood what that meant. They did need me.
