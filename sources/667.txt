 &nbsp; &nbsp;     Periodical:  La Rose Croix</I>      

    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Rose + Croix, La .
 Catalogue du Salon de la Rose-Croix /  Ordre de la Rose-Croix du Temple et du Graal / Geste Esthetique / Catalogue des Oeuvres Exposees.
 1892-1897?  Called Monthly or Quarterly, but actually Annual
 Paris, France.  Language:  French.  Publisher: Commanderie de Tiphereth.  Editor: Josephin Peladan.
 1/1, 1892-1897(?)  5 francs a year.

 This was in effect the catalogue of Sar Peladan's salons and Gestes Esthetiques in Paris in the 1890s, though it also served as a journal and advertisement for his Ordre de la Rose + Croix de Temple et du Graal, as well.  Peladan was  a prominent Symbolist artist of the fin de siecle, with a strong occult bent.  Peladan had originally moved in the circle of Stanislas de Guaita's Rose-Croix kabbalistique but in 1890, principally because of his own strong Catholicism, he had abandoned de Guaita and his work and started his own salons.  ZDB: Stuttgart WLB; BNF.
