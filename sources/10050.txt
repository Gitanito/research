  		              Experience Description   

    I was working on a guitar amp that I was rebuilding.  I was electrocuted by a high-voltage capacitor inside the amp. I remember blacking out and sensing absolutely nothing.

   Then, with what sounded like a flutter of wings, I felt a whoosh of air above me. I saw a brilliant blue-white light. It had the illusion of a circle that kept growing. It got bigger and bigger.  Suddenly, the circle opened up and I could see clearly  into the open circle. Standing in that circle were my musician idols; Leo Fender and Les Paul. I felt intense peace and a sense of being welcome that I never experienced on earth. Leo and Les told me how pleased they were that I played their guitars so well and how it wasn't my time to pass yet. I didn't want to leave where I was, but they said I still had much more to give on earth. I was reluctant to pull back because it was so beautiful where I was. But suddenly I felt a vacuum pull me down hard. 

  I awoke in my workshop, in the presence of paramedics, a neighbor and two police officers. I felt disoriented and my chest was throbbing.  I remember being really, really angry having left such a beautiful place with Les and Leo. I was told that I had been resuscitated by my neighbor. Now, I'm so thankful to my neighbor for saving my life. I owe him everything, even to this day. 

Most of my life I've been an atheist. I still don't believe in God.  There still isn't an explanation on whether NDEs are a natural or a supernatural phenomena, but I have no rational explanation for what I experienced when I was 'dead.' It was one wild ride.
