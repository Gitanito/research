  Before the events happened, I was sitting on my brother's couch and talking to my daughter. She told me, 'Mommy I love you. I’m going to go back outside. I’m going to go play.' I said, 'OK.' 

  I remember everything started going in slow motion and playing out as if it were me who was watching my life through a television. Then all of a sudden, that television show stopped and there was a sort of void like a 'commercial break.' Then it started again, like it was a rerun of the same show but it was all in reverse. All the words were backwards. I couldn’t understand what anyone was saying and why I was looking at myself sitting on the couch. Then all of a sudden, I felt as if I was being thrown back on top of my body, head first. I kept thinking why am I getting another chance at life? Why didn’t I stay dead?

Then I realized that I could hear my brother screaming  at my sister-in-law. I remember being hit in the chest and receiving CPR. Then, I started breathing heavy and convulsing.   
    
    This nightmare still haunts me but it obviously wasn’t my time to leave this earth. My son , daughter and husband still need me. I vividly remember my soul leave my body, my consciousness afterwards, and then my soul returning to my body during CPR. This has definitely caused my PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome) to be worse.  I did not meet a divine being. It was just a scary event.       
    
Background Information:         

Gender:   	Female    

Date NDE Occurred:   	 7/18/2021    

NDE Elements:         

    At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Drug or medication overdose.       Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function)     I remember trying to tell my brother I can’t breathe. Since I couldn’t speak, I picked up my phone and tried texting my best friend but couldn't.    

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely distressing    

    Did you feel separated from your body?      No.      I clearly left my body and existed outside it    

    How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I believe that I knew I had just died and my soul was just returned to my body. My state of consciousness then definitely differs from my normal day to day life. Why should we KNOW that we have just passed and returned?

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         I believe when I knew my soul returned to my body    

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No    

    Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.    Nothing made sense    

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid    

    Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I thought that I was experiencing normal actions at the time when in reality my daughter was no where near me. She had been outside for an hour    

    Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I couldn’t hear anything or anyone until the moment my soul returned to my body. I heard my brother screaming at my sister-in-law    

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, but the facts have not been checked out    

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No         

Did you see any beings in your experience?         No

Did you see an unearthly light?         No       

    Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         Some unfamiliar and strange place.     It was strange only because it was like I was in a rerun of my life at that moment I died. It was  slow and repetitive. The last few words that I spoke to my brother kept repeating over and over again in a loop.    

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Sad , upset , full of regret    

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         No    

Did you have a feeling of joy?         No    

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       No    

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         No         

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         I remembered many past events         

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No         

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No

After the NDE:         

    Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It was difficult in a sense of of trying to communicate the experiencce but not  sounding completely crazy

    Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I told my husband and my son the next day as well as my brother and his wife. They were all very apologetic    

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No       

    What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     That entire experience was absolutely positively  terrifying    

    What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I don’t know why it happened to me but I’m sort of glad I had that experience. It gives me some sort of perception of what is going to happen when it is my time to go    

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No
