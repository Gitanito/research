It was tangled, and she pulled and tugged at my hair to smooth it out. I was standing at the time and I recall looking down our hallway from the living room, where I was standing. Suddenly I remember feeling as if I were floating, I looked down I couldn't see my feet but I knew I was looking down where they would be. I felt a magnetic pull down towards the hallway. I felt a pull that I couldn't break from. I was moving fast. I was going through a dark hallway, I could hear other voices of people, I didn't know whom they were, and I was frightened. The voices of the people sounded like they were confused and didn't understand what was happening to them. I didn't get to travel very far, but I remember it being dark and feeling afraid. I looked at myself but there was nothing physical to see, but I knew I was looking at myself.

As I was traveling I heard my mother sobbing and I turned around and a few feet away, I saw myself lying on the floor lifeless and my mother crying over me. Suddenly a voice said to me, a voice that I could hear only in my head, 'If you continue you can never return.' Seeing my mother sob was so horrible, I ran as hard as I could towards my physical self but I didn't know what to do. A thought in me said jump in, I tried but felt I bounced off. Again, the thought, try harder, and then it worked. I recall sitting on a window sill, the window open and my mother sobbing, and fanning me.
