It worked but not for long. While I was 'dead' there was a shadowy figure next to me. He pointed to my seizing body on the ground.  Then, I felt a surge of pain before returning to life. 

Ever since then, on the anniversary of this event, someone I love dies at the exact time that they had declared me dead, only they stay dead. Other than that, the usual 'paranormal boost' stuff.
