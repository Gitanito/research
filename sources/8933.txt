I was brought down from the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas and was taken to the emergency room. I was examined and I was diagnosed with the following: Nuchal Rigidity, Pyrexic 109F, Abdominal Rigidity. Was taken to the operating room and a laparoscope was performed. Removed my appendix - acute focal resolving appendicitis, also spleen and liver were greatly enlarged. The surgeon had a terrible time closing me but finally did. Moved to the surgical intensive care unit and was there for two days. Moved to the Medicine floor where I remained acutely ill. Next day threw the fat embolus and arrested. I watched myself from the ceiling as they moved me from my room to the elevator up to surgery and then waited for them perform my tracheotomy. I saw them take me back to my room where they proceeded to hook me up to a breathing machine which I remained on for three weeks. The next thing I knew it was April and I was in the hospital. The biopsy from my liver came back as Gaucher's disease
