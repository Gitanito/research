  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  Went body surfing with buddies. I was caught in a current and started to go under the pounding surf. I was having a hard time breathing. I started choking, water rushing in my nose and mouth. DROWNING! I'M GOING TO DIE! After fighting to get air instead of salt water, I began to relax and feel at peace. Slowly sinking so peaceful. Then I looked down and saw myself below. I wanted to close my eyes and sleep.

Please try one more time Pat, one more time. Something was making or forcing me up, UP!

When I hit the surface, water, choking water, exploded from my nose and mouth. Right next to me, I saw this boy with blue dark blue eyes. Can you help me get back? I'm so tired. He looked at me. Put your hand on my shoulder. I ended up on the beach on all fours coughing my guts out. Looking around all I could see were my friends pointing at me. I wanted to thank blue eyes but I couldn't find him. After talking with my friends, they said I swam in alone. I went back a couple of times after that. I never saw the kid again.
