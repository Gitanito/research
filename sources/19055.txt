there&#39;s a certain problem and a certain
value to notoriety or contacts so the
nice thing about our network it&#39;s now
very large I can easily reach pretty
much any world leader in the world with
something that would be legitimate there
are as you may have gotten from my
comments a number of very high net-worth
people who don&#39;t want to do this until
it&#39;s a chicken egg they don&#39;t want to
get involved till they see there&#39;s
something working but we don&#39;t have
something working till someone gets us
something and it&#39;s this chicken egg
thing so and these are not people who
are just you know wanting to be first to
be second they&#39;re sincere people but
they say I got to see something that can
be independently tested and verified it
cannot be hearsay on that on YouTube so
we have built this massive network that
is very substantial for the last 20
years and it would be immediately
activated the other thing that would be
immediately activated and I want to talk
about our strategy because it&#39;s like
what&#39;s the day after you get something
that&#39;s confirmed well first of all it&#39;s
going to be all over the internet the
reports just like we did for the Atacama
humanoid from dr. Lachman and the people
that Stanford are going to be on the
internet if you can read you can read
the report so it&#39;ll be and prestigious
universities and academics who will have
tested and said this is what it is they
may say we don&#39;t know where the energy
is coming from because if they were
trained in classic fit or even quantum
physics they&#39;re not going to know a
whole lot about the zero-point energy
field in quantum vacuum and all this but
they can verify the energy input an
output that there are no tricks and the
lab will be a no say from these plans we
were able to reproduce it now we have
many many contacts who can do that part
of it but that would have to be released
to the public in a very large National
Press Club or similar event but where
you would have the probe announce the
device there you would have the test
team reports they&#39;re blown up and you
would have the pedigree
for who the people were who reproduce it
in tested it because extraordinary
claims require extraordinary evidence
so one of the few things I agree with
Carl Sagan on and I think in this case
that&#39;s what you have to do but it has to
be a massive release of the public very
quickly because here&#39;s the other thing
that people working like the group that
took the stand Meyer materials they do
not understand that time is your enemy
all right the longer you perseverate and
sit on something like this with the
public not knowing the riskier it is is
very dangerous so you want to get you
don&#39;t you don&#39;t want to jump the gun and
say you have something when you don&#39;t on
the other hand at the instant you&#39;re
certain and I mean a hundred percent
certain scientifically you want to do a
mass and now that would require a
funding because just to do the the the
PR and it and and the public education
on this would run probably into the you
know two or three million dollars but I
think that that&#39;s that&#39;s less that that
won&#39;t be so difficult once we have
something operational I&#39;ll just say a
foundation I&#39;ve recently met with the
the head of that foundation wants to
help us and he&#39;s raised for his
foundation several hundred million
dollars in the last few years and and so
there are a lot of people watching what
we&#39;re doing who are interested but
they&#39;re wanting it&#39;s sort of like that
old commercial where&#39;s the beef they&#39;re
wanting to see something and I&#39;ve been
in the trenches looking for that where
that really is and and our story of this
has been both very very promising
because I&#39;ve seen things that actually
do work but then also incredibly
disappointing to see how they get
disappear and gets suppressed one of the
reasons we do not want to fund any of
these sort of inventors and scientists
even ones that had the bonafide ease of
this gentleman down and at the
Huntsville Space Flight Center in the
Redstone Arsenal it&#39;s because if they&#39;re
a lone wolf doing this somewhere no one
knows who they are because they&#39;re an
obscure person that obscurity is
dangerous obscurity is dangerous and
this harkens back to you know how my
life has been ruined
by being a public person on all this you
know where I walk into a wholefoods
people know who I am many times will
come up which is fine and I don&#39;t find
it all flattering it&#39;s more often
annoying than anything but the the fact
is is that millions of people are
following what we&#39;re doing when the film
Sirius came out The Huffington Post
headed it was the biggest story for
almost a week on The Huffington Post
millions and millions and millions of
people reading about it so we have a
certain reach that a small inventor
can&#39;t have and what I want to do is say
if you can bring us the payload we&#39;ll
launch it so we&#39;re the we&#39;re at the
launch and will disclose it now and you
know I don&#39;t care if someone threatens
my life or offers me two billion dollars
an intelligence director head back in
1992 offered me two billion dollars
personally and then went to my wife and
tried to convince her to convince me to
shut down what I was doing I said I
don&#39;t care about two billion dollars so
you cannot be bought and you cannot be
afraid and I guess because I had a
near-death experience when I was young
I&#39;m not afraid of death and so you just
have to go now one of the things that
was interesting after we were in New
York this past week as I mentioned I was
I was we&#39;re at dinner meeting with a
number of people some very very high
net-worth people and we were talking
about this and someone said well what&#39;s
the guarantee that if you had your own
lab you could just do I said a guarantee
I think you know go ask my great great
great whatever grandfather who was
called as the one of the first prisoner
of war with the British during the
American Revolution what the guarantee
was that that little experiment called
the American Revolution would have
worked I mean if we are all so averse to
risk that were not willing to do
something this important for the world
for our children and our children&#39;s
children from gaya which is a living
breathing being then who are we you know
what are we as a people I mean if there
was that level of a lack of courage and
this sort of putting your finger in the
wind and seeing what the safe path is
there would have never been the American
Revolution all of us would be
goose-stepping
Adolf Hitler&#39;s great-grandson etc and so
on so at a certain point we have got two
events the courage to do this
but we have to put that around something
now I&#39;m willing to do that part of it as
are a number of wonderful people I&#39;ve
been working with for many years some of
whom are not known in the public and
frankly don&#39;t need to be known in the
public in fact they&#39;ll say usually you
do that
but I think that that&#39;s why if if we as
a people come together and say how can
we support this so that&#39;s one pathway to
disclosing a device here&#39;s a challenge
here&#39;s the criteria here&#39;s the award
there&#39;s another one and that was the
impetus for the film serious now the
film serious as you all know has been
phenomenal as the largest crowd funded
documentary in history in history period
to this day it has been seen by millions
of people in the world but most of the
people who&#39;ve seen it have seen it on
pirated sites for free the intent of the
film was that it would become sort of a
rallying calls for the public to provide
the donation so that we could open out
near the University of Virginia where we
live in a wonderful area where there are
a lot of talent a research and
development lab the the budget of which
is on the website serious disclosure
calm it&#39;s about 6.4 million which most
VC people venture capital people when
they hear that number they go are you
crazy
to open a whole lab with all this
high-tech stuff and 18 people and so
it&#39;s only for a two year period that&#39;s
just a budget I am highly confident that
if we had that budget and that funding
we would be there because I&#39;m sitting on
just let&#39;s say some intellectual
property given to me by a brilliant
engineer who was being recruited by the
CIA and part of their recruitment was to
let him go into secret files and copy
things to study which he kept in which
he&#39;s now given to me it&#39;s thousands of
pages of amazing stuff but it&#39;s again
it&#39;s pages two-dimensional you got to
build it up and for that you need a team
and for that you need funding now we
have only raised maybe less than a
quarter of a million out of the 2.4 6.4
million for the energy lab and you can
go to our website and there&#39;s a little
ticker we change every month or two and
that&#39;s mainly because most people think
someone else is going to do this to the
people who have contributed who are in
this room thank you very much
but you cannot open a research facility
for that the equipment list runs to half
a million dollars and that is really
pared down so we don&#39;t even have half
what the equipment would be nevermind
the building 18 personnel with payroll
benefits everything because these
brilliant engineers and scientists that
I&#39;ve met they&#39;re not going to leave
their day jobs where they&#39;re making a
hundred and fifty thousand a year or two
hundred thousand a years in engineer
with benefits to work for free because
they have a family to have kids in
college I mean let&#39;s live in the real
world for a nanosecond you know you have
got to have the ability I was crazy
enough to leave my profession and I have
personally for gone around eight million
dollars in income to do what I&#39;m doing
and I have the most amazing wife ever
that has been supportive of me doing
this because she understands what&#39;s at
stake but most families would not put up
with that and most people wouldn&#39;t do it
and you can&#39;t expect them to so we have
to be compassionate about the fact that
people have basic needs to live I mean
no one needs to get rich off this we
want to do it and put it out open source
but they have to have food on the table
and if their kids are in college and
what happened have to have health care
and blah blah blah and then you have to
have some degree of technology support
project management and tactical security
thereby no difference in tactical and
strategic security tactical means you
got cameras there
it&#39;s streamed on YouTube you have a
certain secure area so people can&#39;t come
in and just sabotage what you&#39;re doing
and change a circuit okay so you have to
have security strategic security is what
we already have that we build over the
last twenty years and that is all of you
guys the public and all the people who
are
in the public butter in high positions
waiting for something to happen who are
all the guys and women and agencies who
are saying we want to be first to be
second we don&#39;t wanna be first to be
first because this is too disruptive
it&#39;s too controversial and you know what
if you study the history of the world
the big changes that have happened have
never come from the centers of power
right whether it was Rome or now the
United States you know the you know the
Hawks Americana it&#39;s never coming from
your your sort of hidebound academic
corporate and governmental centers of
power always comes from out here
somebody in their basement inventing
something like Steven jobs did or what
have you so this is something that I
think similarly but it has a unique
challenge that a normal technology
doesn&#39;t face and that is if you come up
with a better computer feel that hacker
it may not like you or even Apple may
not like you but it will come out there
there&#39;s no prevailing national security
problem with that until you get to the
uber super computers which NSA are
working on but if you do something like
this that changes the entire way the
world operates and the need for even a
petrol dollar and the need for oil and
gas and coal and utilities and nuclear
power it is such a huge change I&#39;m gonna
say something here that people may take
is hyperbole but it is not if you were
to add up every technological
development from the Industrial
Revolution in the 1800&#39;s to now and
added it all up the internal combustion
engine cars planes trains jets rockets
the internet integrated circuits
biotechnology medical everything this
one area of physics science and
technology absolutely in terms of its
economic effect it&#39;s changing the way
the world will operate eclipses all of
them in their aggregate so a hundred and
fifty years of industrial development
this one area will be larger which is
needed now people say well that&#39;s kind
of very futuristic I&#39;m going no is back
to the future because we should have had
these technologies beginning to be
developed and released a hundred years
ago except there were cartels like
Standard Oil and JP Morgan and other
folks who didn&#39;t want it out then and
there are other cartels that don&#39;t want
it out now the people who have a stake
aren&#39;t all in that camp but they also
don&#39;t want to step out in front of this
freight train some people have asked me
aren&#39;t there some people I mean I was
there&#39;s a man who is up and again of the
reason I don&#39;t want to name names you
know it&#39;s like Eleanor Roosevelt said
I&#39;m gonna paraphrase great minds discuss
ideas mediocre minds discuss events in
small minds discuss people which is
really true unfortunately we&#39;ve become
very tabloid internet tabloid and people
want to just gossip so I&#39;m not gonna I
don&#39;t like doing that but there is a man
who back in after the disclosure project
National Press Club um a few years later
had been watching what we were doing he
was a billionaire and has a place out in
Virginia and he sometimes would let us
use it one of his prey had five private
jets so you could go here and there and
it was fun but you live in 1,500 acres
and had this house that looked like a
UFO with bulletproof glass and then had
a mountain that he had leveled off so
one of his small jets could land there
and a helices life hadn&#39;t had to
antebellum mansion on the other part of
the estate very interesting guy and he
he actually had his son the day after
Thanksgiving one year land his
helicopter in my meadow to pick up a
grocery bag like he&#39;d get from Kroger of
disclosure videos and material to take
back to his father my mother was going
Steven what are you doing is what you&#39;re
doing dangerous why is this man landing
my poor mother anyway so
welcome to my world isn&#39;t that been how
I think of my children couldn&#39;t been
easy being raised this way so
oh it&#39;s Thanksgiving dinner wonderful
the day after and here this guy&#39;s
landing a high-altitude helicopter in
our middle but the scion of this family
very interested in all this so he
eventually invites me out to his estate
and we meet and you know he has pictures
of himself with Ronald Reagan and all
these people from all over the world and
I&#39;m going oh no cool so he was very nice
he made a hundred thousand dollar
donation to the to disclosure project so
we could publish and move out the
briefing materials into the disclosure
book and all that stuff and get it at a
very inexpensive cost during that period
out to as many people as we could kind
of subsidized and I said well that&#39;s
great thank you very much I said well
what we really want to work on right now
the next phase of disclosure because
we&#39;ve done the thing with all the
witnesses and stuff and there were 800
million people by the way around the
world saw that let&#39;s do the next phase
and bring out the technologies as oh no
any sky is 85 years old and I said look
you know yeah I mean come on you&#39;re a
yeren you&#39;re a tease let&#39;s take a like
it&#39;s like a chance on this he says no
it&#39;s too dangerous
now this is a guy who out the tailpipe
of his Gulfstream&#39;s and yet five jets
could have funded this entire energy
research lab no problem I mean is this
unbelievable not wealth but he said he
says no I mean I back in the late 60s I
knew the head of General Motors because
this man was an industrialist and I said
you know so and we&#39;re having lunch in
his home at this flying saucer house is
hilarious and I said well would what did
you learn he says I learned that GM
already had these technologies that they
were on a black shelf but that this
executive felt that it was time to end
the secrecy on it and so that every GM
car coming off the conveyor belt would
be electric but not have to be plugged
in of true electric car like what Tesla
ought to have and two weeks later this
executive was found dead of an apparent
suicide and he said every single one of
us knew that this man was not suicidal
but he was doing this from within GM and
in a clandestine in a way that was very
quiet and he was making too much noise
and he&#39;s dead now I said well can you
prove that that that he was killed by
some dark elements he says no but
everyone knew that&#39;s what happened and I
said for that reason I&#39;m not willing to
help I said what if you moved the money
through an offshore entity no they&#39;ll
know where the money came from because
they would they dab solutely know
instantly and IC says well what do you
are you afraid for your own safety as oh
I don&#39;t care I&#39;ll be dead in a couple
years
here&#39;s his old crib mudgin fantastic he
says but I have my children and my
grandchildren fly around on my planes
and there could be a malfunction he says
I&#39;m not willing to do that how many
billionaires like that have I met with
more than a dozen every time it&#39;s a
similar line it&#39;s either I don&#39;t want to
get involved in this something this
controversial or I&#39;m afraid something
could happen to my interests or whoever
or so the ones who know how the national
security super state works which is
ruthless rogue and criminal don&#39;t want
to step and you know touch this third
rail and get you to get exact the ones
who don&#39;t know are just sort of it if
they don&#39;t know about that then what
their concern is is that their peerage
will be upset with them what I mean by
peerage people that they work with who
would be adversely affected by such a
disclosure of a technology like this
