  		              		Experience Description   

    On Halloween night in 2012, I was riding a moped to my friend's house to hang-out. I lived in a very small town and the fastest posted speed limit sign was 35mph. I was at a stop light when the light turned green so I started to go. All of a sudden, I was hit by a Cadillac CTS sedan going just over 40mph  that had run a red light.   

  This caused a serious injury accident since I was on a moped.  I was air lifted to a level-one trauma hospital. I bled out in the helicopter. Once I arrived at the hospital, the emergency room doctor performed a clam-shell thoracotomy. 

  I remember feeling very peaceful as I walk through the flaps of a massive, bright-white tent. Inside the tent, it was full of light and Happiness. There was every kind of animal walking around in harmony with humans. All of the humans were younger. Nobody looked older than 30 years old. Everybody was jovial and laughing. It was a place that I had never been before and I didn't want to leave. 

  I look to my right and  saw a young man in military fatigues. I thought to myself, 'I know him! That's my grandfather!' He was so young and I had never seen him like that. My grandfather was seated and told me to sit next to him. I gladly came over and sat down. We started talking. We talked for what seemed like hours upon hours. I specifically remember stressing that my legs are in so much pain and I'm fearful I will never walk again. My grandfather assured me that my legs would be all right. I always respected and trusted my grandfather and at that point I knew I would be o.k. 

  Then I started hearing a Female voice calling my name. After a few times of hearing my name, I recognized the voice as coming from my mother. I told my grandfather that I have to go because mom is calling me and I don't want her to be upset. My grandfather  asked me to stay with him. I remember considering what I should  do. I remember getting up from the chair and  heading towards my mother's voice. 

  Then  I woke up from my coma. My mother kept whispering my name in my ear  and telling me how much she loved me. I was back in this world we call life. After a few weeks, a nurse had asked if I went anywhere while in my coma. I told her yes and proceeded to tell the nurse and my folks where I was and what I saw.
