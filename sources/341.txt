blc a pUrfuit. It was principally with this view, and
to afiift private families in th, moments of extremity'·
that I was induced to offer thofe fimple modes of cure
and felf-prefervation, f6 amply difpenfed in my edition
of the Family Phyfician. And my prefent purpofc
\leing to make that invaluable family bopk frill more
~mplete, I lhall here explain,the nature of human ge-
neration, and the principles of animal life, that I may
from thence deduce the origin of hereditary difeafes,
and poin.t out with more facility thofe which are acd-
dcntal. And in this Treatife I lhall endeavour to fur-
nHh. my, readers with iuchobvious direaions for tfahew-
ing the evil, and choofi11gthegopd,~that, if refolutely fol-
lowed, will not fail to preferve health and longlife, and
prove of no fmall benefit to future generations.
When God created. Adam, he planted in him the
leeds of that Divine Etfence requifite to propagate the
Jtuman lift andJo1tl. Theologifts may contradiCt me '
yet I will n<>t fo much derog~e from the wifdom.and.
omnipotence of the Creator, as to fuppofe he lhould.
watch the impregnationof every human female, and by
lo manyfeparate and diftintt ads of his power, giveli(e,
fpirit, and foul, to the fretus. The Creator of Man,
'.riewing with unb()Unded, forefight the purpofes before
him, by one att of his-omnipotence, blended in Adam
Jll the faculti~ of the human and celeftial nature ;
tnd, without any doubt~ when he Wa$ formed one, in · '
God's exprefs image, he poff'elfed the means Qf propa-

m;m reafon with the mechanifm of Divine Wudom 1.
and yetourconceptions may in fome degree unravel the
my~eries of nature by caufes and fpeculations, which.
in proportion as they captivate our fenfes, arid raikour'
admiration, excite in us a reverential awe of futurity.
and a grateful fellfibility of the goodnefs and mercy cl
Him who gave us being.
.From the evidence of fcripture it is indifputably
clear, that in the perfon of Adam the male andfemale
propertieswereoriginally combined; as indee<;l we now
find them in many fpecies of the lower cWS of ani-
mais ; confequently the expreffion of male andfotJllJe.'
does not necelrarily imply two diftintt bodies. .In Ge-
nefis i. 27,. we read, that God created man i11 bit~
image, i.e. of perfeaion; including or containing the
prolific or generating powers, which are diftinguifhcd
by the expreffion of male and female ; and God !Jltffoi
them, i. e. thefe male and female properties, aJtldfaiJ
a11to them,'Jncreaje 1J11d multiply, andreplenijh the eartb,
i. e. 1Vith beings like Adam ; for this benedi&ion, and:
this command, were antecedent to the formation of Eve,
· as every one mua know who reads the fuft andfecond
chapters of Genefts.
In this pl111'a/ capacity, therefore, Adam received the
blefi'mg of God, when he faid unto him, Befruitful au
multiply, and replemjh tbe earth, andjubd11e it; andhaw
Jomi11i011 O'TJtr thefifh of thefaa, and O'lJtr thefowls oftbd

and on the feventh day God refted from all his work ;
and having foimed Adam, ;md breathed into his nof-

trils the breath of life, he !Jecame a living foul.' God
alfo planted the garden of Eden, and put the man into
it~ to till it, and to drefs it ; and God commanded the
man, faying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayeft . ~
fi:eely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good
· ·and evil,·thou fhalt not eat of it; for in the day that
thou e~teft thereo(, thoujhaltfurely die. Gen. ii. 27.
· Let us here remark, that all thefe tranfadions, ~.
jund'ions, ·and commands, had paffed before Eve was
farmed, or, ih other words, before the male and female
effences were feparated and made the effential parts of
two diftin& perfons. Adam likewife, beforethis event
took place, was appointed God's viceroy over all earthly
things, both·animate and inanimate; the very elements
' ' 'being made fubjett: to him;. for" he-wasformed more
iti!Jle than the angels, and crowJZed with gkry and ho-
· ~~
.nour ;" i. e. having the peculiar advantage of mu!tiply-
ilig lfis own race. He was, as to his external form,
moulded of the celeftial rether; and therefore, previ-
ous to his fal~ his body emanated rays of brightnefs
and fplendour, fimilar to thofe which our ideas fum.ifh
of Mofes and Elias when they converfed with.God. ·
His reafoning faculty, and living Soul, were formed of
the eternal effence or Tind:ure of the Divinity; be~ng
nothing lefs than what is ·termed the heath ·of God,
that fpark of immortality which gene~tes thefoul, AAd
is the diftinguit'hing charatl:eriftic between man and
beaft. For, although brute animals inherit th~ five
{enfes, and poffefs an inflin& to diretl: them in the choice
of food, and to impel the propagation of their fpe~ies •

all formed, and transferred to pofterity. "For witb
t_be powers God·bath endued man,.with theJome powers

From the foregoing palfages we are warranted to .in-
fer, that the original man was poffeifed of his fpiritual
foul, and rational intclled:, for the purpofe of propa_.
gating thefame to all future generations. Bythe force.
_of this rational intelled:, or eternal fpirit, unclouded by
·~he deformity of fin, he knew and perceived the ~~­
an~ ·property of every animated being i and to exer-
c;:ife this intelled:, God br<>Ught before hi,m every ere-

Yet by due attention to our reafoning faculty, 'it is no

The imper!ccHons and difeafes of the body, there-
fore, .beginning with Adam, are in confequence tranf-
mitted to his pofterity:; and may be divided into here~­

Others again fuppofe, that the internal orifice of the
womb becomes open an~ perv.ious during the exertion
and enjoyment of copulation, ~d that the glans of
the penis ahfolutely pafs into the cavity of the womb~
and ejed: the feed immediately upon the ovaria. To
each of thefe theories there appear infuperable objec-
tions. .In refutation of the firft, we need only obferve,
that the vagina, from its ftrud:ure, and from its organ-
ization i,n the ad: of venery, is difpofed ftrongly, and
in every part, to embrace the penis ; and as the glans· ·
muft thereby be clofely furrounded, although it reaches
not in every perfon to the furtheft limits of the vagina;
the flight and momentary impetus of the femen will
thus be very e.ffed:ually refifted, if not totally fubdued.
If the penis be not of magnitude fuffi.cient to occupy
the vagina.to its foll extent, the unoccupiedfpace muft
be fomehow diftel)ded ; and, let this vacuum be what
·it will, its refifbµtce muft he e.ffeetual; and, if it be not
diftended, the power or preffure which occafions ..its.
collapfe will over-balance the impetus of the femen.,
But fuppofing .the virile member in all cafes to be fo.
ex<ll.'tly proportioned as to occupy the whole length of
the. uterine canal, which·however we know is nQt the
cafe, 'yet from what principle fuall we afcertain that the
feminal tube of the penis, and the apex of the womb,·
fuall be made fo exad:ly to correfpond as to b~oJ11e
continuous ? The femen, in the event of c9ition, is
doubtlefsly thrown out by the penis with fame force,.
though this force will always depend uj>on the v:igoy.r
of the male organs, and therefore muft vary ~ the

foweft to ·the higheA:.degree.of vigour of which tltofe
&rgans can be fufceptible. But ~n allowing the glans
penis and apex of the womb to fall into exad: contatl
·upon due penetration, and that the male feed is always
ejed:ed with'confiderable force from the penis, and the
vagina to be no banier to tpe progrefs of 'it, yet how
~it to force its way into the cavity of the womb ?
The aperture which leads from the vagina or great
anal into the womb, is in fad: no aperture at all. Du-
ring menftruation, indeed, it is perviou~; but even thert
it is only capable of admitting a very fmall probe ;
~d this is. no argument that it is naturallyJ and at other
fiincs, pervious. How often too has this aperture been
entirely blocked up by preternatural obftru&ions, and
conception neverthelefs taken place ? Inftances of thi$
JiaTC often occurred ; and the precifion and authority
with w'.hich they are recorded by different prttttitionersj
Jean no room to evade the argument. Hence .this
mode of impregnat~on appears not only highly objec-·
tionable, but ·utterly impoffible; having no corref-
ft<>ndcncc with·the human ftrud:U'l"e, or with ~ eco...
Jiomy of Nature.
Aftetwhat ms been·fajd, it may appeat idle to pro-.
t.<:ute any farther refutation of the progtefs of the ·
male feed by the Fallopian tubes, or through the mouth
of the womb. .But as authors of the greaten: refpeda-
bility have believed in its progrefs through the tubes,
and tell us they have even ·feen it there, it .may not
~ improper to- enquire how far this is afcertainable.

by what effort of .it; is the male femen to beconduded
through this conical and convoluted canal ? Can the
fe.men now poifefs a.ny·adive force> to introduce itfelf
~hrough the rigid perforations of this wgan, and t-o
overcome the collapfe of ·the tubes ? The ftimmating
t'ower of the femen muft foon be loft in a.veff'el which

times be conftricted. Nature, though 1he ieems i:1gc•
neral unfriendly to exceffive luft, yetfometimcs permits
it; and thefe are the means ihe feems to have appointed
for heightening it. , Befides, it is proper that the ani.. ·
rnal inftin&, which prompts the reproduction of the
fpecies, ihould not be difappointed in its gratification,
however brutal thefe fenfations'and ideas may appear
to the purified philofopher. Thefe means then, how•
ever they may contribute to the mutual fentibility or
the fexes, in the voluptuous gratification of animal
pleafure, appear to have no real influence on the pro-
cefs of generation, after the venereal congrefs has cea•
fed ; nay, we have reafon to believe that their adiori
or infiuence does not extend beyond the limits of the
vagina, except in common with the reft of the general.
fyftem, even during that congrefs. If an affiwc of
blood to thefe parts were always to be attended with
thefe effects, what violence muft the ovaria be expofed
fo by reiterated coition, and by every return of the
in~ftrual difcharge ! During the menftrual amux; a

the fimbriz diverted from exercifing thofe functions
which turgidity, though from anothercaufe, at another
rime fo fuccefsfully inftigates ? Alfo how happens if
that grateful copulation is not always produaive, and
the contrary ? that the fimbri~, in every venereal ad)

more f~tufes, or.a wafte of the ova? and that the or-
gansthemfelve; ai;e not incapacitat~d, or diminifued in.
their energy, by fuch repeated exertions ? we haye
~very reafon.t~ert t.o conclude, that the· tenfion and
conftrittion of the female organs, induced by the afflux
of·blood d~ring coition, if of confequence, are intended
folely 'to ·' promote animal gratification ; and that they
have no dired influence on the actual progrefs of the
fem~n through,the above-defcribed communications to.
the ovaria.
_ Upon the whole, it is certainly no way equivocal, .
that the femen cannot, in any manner, be applied to
the ovaria by means of the fimbri~ ; that ,it cannot
afc,end or advance through the convolutions of the Fal-.
lopian tubes ; that it cannot divaricate and traverfe the
·compreffed uterus ; and that it cannot even operate a
pafTage through the rigid bulwark of the cervix uteri.
The probability of the progrefs of the aura Jeminalis
through th~ fame paths is deftroyed by the fame ar-
guments; and the whimfical opinions founded on the
prefence ofanimalcules in the femen, and on the organic
bodies furnifued ~y.the femen of both fexes, and uni-
ting in the uterus, as ~ as this alledged aperrure is

~nee of the male feed mufl: be powerfully incorpo-
-rated with the female, and dire«R:ed to the ovaria, before
this effed can poffibly take place. Wc have alrea<:ly
.feen how this cannot happen ; let us now ·endeavour
to point out a rational medium by which ~t may _b~ ac-

ph~, and· rifing obliquely· about five inches, js loft
upon the uterus. Its· capacity is very different in
different fubjetb, and in no very diftant periods of
life in the Caine fubje&. A very refpettable anatomift
finifues:his defcription of it by faying, it is " membro
·'CJiriliJecundum omnes dimenjiones accommoda/,iJis." Its
inner membrane, though very uneven, is delicately
{mooth, and, from its nervous texture, exquifitely fen-
fible ; the outer membrane is more fpongy and muf-
cular' and, the whole body of the canal is very plen-·
·tifully fuppliedwith blood-veffels, nerves~ and lympha-
tics. We know little more of the lymphatics of thefe
parts, thanthatthey are more numerous proportionally
'.than in any other part of the body. Thofe which ori.. ·
ginate in the exterior parts.of the female genital fyftem,
traverfe 'the inguinal glands, while the deep-featedones
take a much more direCl: courfe to their place of union
.:with the ladeals : but of thefe we 1hall be more parti-
cular, when we adduce our obfervations in favour of a
very powerful abforption fubfilling in the vagina.
: The entrance into the canal of the uterus f~om
without, is guarded hy·
·the nymphz, which form an
eminence on·each ftde, fo peculiarly conftruded and
arranged; that we muft think lightly of the phyfiologift
who could fuppofe them to be only appendages in office
to-the urethra. Indeed, as nature frequently operates
more than one end by a particular ftruCl:ure, we 1hall
not pretend to ·limit the fecondary or inferior offices
which the nymphz may promote; but we fee much.

this belief; ·and it will not be impaired by the allegation,
that thefe ridges by no means conftitute a ~gular :utd
complete valve. Immediately within this barrier, a
fl:rud:ure, on the fame principles as thofe of the nym-
.phre, but more elegant and powerful, commences; and
it is continued over the furface of the vagina, gradUally
growing finer, till it is loft in fmoothnefs near th~ up-
per extremity of the canal. This fl:rud:ure is the rugre
of the vagina, fo accurately drawn and defcribed by
Haller and others; but degraded by fome anatomifts, .
who inark it only as ufeful in exciting venereal enjoy-
ment, or admitting expanfton during coition and par-
turition. It is infinuating a mean and difgraceful re-
fled:ion on the important order and operations of nature
to fuppofe, that thefe rugre, which are not cafually ar-
ranged, but are regulated with as much precifion and

affert, that this intricate, extenfive, and beautiful, ar-
rangement, has been fo minutely laboured for no other
purpofe, hut merely to excite a greater titillation du-
ring the grofs and libidinous commerce of the fexes,
and a greater extenfion during parturition. This ftruc-

but in a confirmed lues, the fundus of the vagina.is
rarely the feat of ulcer, and it is never aff'ected in gon-
norrhrea. Here the furface of thevaginabeing moftly
fmooth, the ·poifon runs downwards, till, falling upon.
the rugre, it is there intercepted and retarded. · Here
then the poifon is' multiplied, and leifurely applied ro
the mouths of the lymphatic~, through which it iscar-
ried into the blood; where, affimilating together, it
contaminates the whole mafs. Though the progre&
:of the fyphilitic poifon is not always thus regular, the
variations do not affect this opinion. When the Iym•
phatics, and their glands, are vigorous and eafily per-
meable i when the application of the venereal virus is
within the nymphre; and when it i~ fufficiently active,
th~ firft fymptoms of difeafe arife from general conta-
mination; ~d was this poifon always very mild, and
taken up by the abforbents within the nymph:e, there
is no doubt but the whole mafs would almoft always
be difeafed, without much chance of ulcer orpreceding
bubo. But there are many circwnftancel! which tend
to reta:rd the fpeedy abforption of fyphilitic v~rus, even
when it is extremely aCl:ive; and, among thefe~ the in-
flammation which in general it mufr induce, is not
perhaps the.leaft confider11.ble ; but thefe cannot aife~<t
the abforption of the feininal fJuid of the male. The

·much oftener in women than in men. The ciire of
fyphilis, too, by fpecific remedies introduced into the
vagina~ fully demonftrates the ftrength and adivity of
the lymphatics in this canal." Is there then a ready and

by nature ; and thefc bodies are generated, and com-
pleted within them, which will exifr without impreg-
nation by the male, but which this impregnation alone
can finally maturate and evolve. That thefe bodies
are not generated at ari earlier date, anatomy as well
~ reafon, founded on the foregoing arguments; atrure
us; and, that the ova of all the fretufes, which the
female is-afterwards to produce, are generated at that
time, (eems equally certain. · Though this change in
the ovaria is the moft efrential, the whole genital fyf-
tem alfo undergoes a very material change. The
~mpl~ alterations of ftruaure and dimenftons in the
different parts of this fyil:em, though they are necefi"ary
and fubfervicnt to generation and parturition, ret they
arc not fo material, either in themfelves, orto our pur..·
pofe, as·to require a minute defcription, '{his, how.,;
ever,· is not the cafe with refpea: to the menfes. It is
chiefiy with a view·to the nutrition of the fretus that ~
this extra-fanguification in the femate is provided by'
nature; which is determined to the genital fyftem, in·
the fame manner as the other fluids are determined to
other outlets; but as the continued drilling off of thia
extra blood would be exceedingly inconvenient and
difgufting, nature has prepared, as it were, acUl:em for
its reception. What may be fufficient to bring on the ·
hzmorrhage, however, is only accumulated; and the
general redundancy, induced by the obftruction and
~~umulation, fubftdes gradually as the hzmorrhage
goes on. This is the manner of menftruation in the:

unimpregnated female, and the(e are the reafons why
it aifumes a .periodical form. In the impregnated
female again, the preparation of extra blood ftill con..; .
..tinues, but its confumption becomes very different.
By the extenfion of the uterus, and by the wafte occa-
fioned l>y the nourifhment of the fretus and its invo"."
~ucra, the. furcharge, or extra preparation of blood is
nearly balanced, or is taken up as it is prepared ; and
hence the ·periodical efforts are almoft loft In the firft
months of pregnancy, however, the uterine fyftem is
.not always able to confume the furcharge of blood, and
thereby take off the periodical effort ; and hence it is
that the lofs of the fretus happens moft generally in
the early months, and at the ufual peri0d of the menfes,
:unlefs ~ome accident has fupervened. And it is nearly
from the fame reafons that mifcarriage is fo often to be
' appreh~nded in the latter months of pregnancy, and
that the fcetus is afterwards expelled from the womb.
When the fcetus has acquired all that bulk and ftrength
which the capacity and powers of the uterus can con-
fer, and when a change of circulation and mode of
life bec9mes neceifary to it, the uterus and fcetus be-
come plethoric ; a general accumulation fucceeds; and
the periodical efforts of the menfes return. During
the middle months ofpregnancy the fcetus is in a ftate of
rapid growth, and is capable of confuming all the blood
which the mother. can furnifh,; but there is neither
room nor wafte, in the latter months, for the blood
which the mother is conilantly pouring in; and hence
arifes that plethora, both in mother and c~ild, which is

But beudes the utility of menftruation to the f~,
there is a very evident connetHon between it and itri-
pregnation. To fpeak of it as a proofo( the ripened
qualifications of the fema!e, is fo fay nothing; itS im-.

Who will reconcile this---and it is no modern and
groundlefs obfervation---t'o the confequence which has
been afcribed to turgidity and tenfion:, which we have
already adverted to ? Almoft every woman wlio has
frequently undergone pregnancy, and-who has attended
jud:icioufly to the phcenomena of that fituation, cafcl.1..
la:tes from the laft celfation of the menfes. At this
time, or rather very foon after, the plethoric tumult of
the general fyftem is completely fubfided, and the ab-
fotbed femen gets quiet and unanticipated poff'effion of
the circulating blood ; and at the fame time the gra..
dually returning plethora promotes its·ac9:ion, and per-
haps its determination to the ovaria. When·the mehfes
are interrupted, or profufe and frequent, impregnation
feldo~ takes place; and it'admits not of a doubt, that
when the determination of this _blood i~ towards the·
mammie, in the-:form of milk, coition is unfuccefsful ;
and as foon as its determination to the uterine fyftem

If fuch are the effects of t~e feminal fluid when

Coition, or rather t;he abforption of the f~minal fluid
of the male by the female, even when not fucceeded

That the final infl'uence of this elaborate proce&
1hould be determined particularly, and at all times, to
the ovaria, is no way marvellous. To qualify the
ovatia for this, ·they are fupplied with a congeries o(
bl~od-vetfels and nei-Ves, at puberty larger and more
numerous than what is allotted to any other part of
fimilar magnitude. Were the ovaria merely a recep-
tacle for the ova, which the venereal orgafm, commu-
nicated by the nerves, or by the impulfion of the ap-
plied femen, was to lacerate; what ufe would there be
for fo intricate and extenfive an arrangement of blood-
vefi"els and nerves ? But we may farther remark, that
every diftintl: procefs in the human body, either during
health or difeafe, tends to one particular and diftinct

It is during this interval, betWeen produd:ive coition
and the exclufton of the ovum from the ovatia, that
likenefs, hereditary difeafes, and the like, are commu-
nicated and acquired. .lnftead of that influence which
the imagination of' the 'mother is fuppofed to.p.offefs
over. the form of the child, might we not fufped, that
·the feminal fluid of the male, co-operating, during this
interval, with the influence of the female upon the
ovum, inftigated a likenefs, according to the·influence
of the male and female tinCl:ures, in the united ptinci..
pies? It is duri,ng this period only that the difea(es of
the male can he communicated to the child; and, if we
admit not.of.this interval and general operation of the
feminal fluid, we cannot fee how they can be comn:iu-
nicated, though tho(e of the mother may be commu-
nicated then or at a much laterperiod, confidering ~ow
the child is nourilhed while it is in the uterus and at
the hreaft. It may be urged agaipft thii early and ~f-:
fedual acquifition of likenefs, tq.at the f~tus does no~
acquire even the divifion or its large!\: members till
long after its exclufion from the ovaria : but then we
are con~dent, that, a.S the fretus takes all its form an~
.other properties from t!ie active fubtilty of thefe blend-
ed tindures, we c~nnot fee any_ reafon why it 1hould,
not poffefs this hereditaty faculty, incommon withthe

female, how happens it that the children of thofe whofe
profligate manners render the father u.ncert~, _

While men continue in the fame climate, and even
in the fame diftritt, an uniform peculiarity of features
and figure prevails among them, little affed:ed by all
thofe changes which improve or degrade the mind ;
but when they migrate, or when they are corrupted by
the migi;ation of others, this national diftintl:ion in
'time is loft, though in th~ latter cafe it feems to be re..
coverable, unlefs the caufe of change be continued•.
The beautifµl form and features of the ancient Greeks

'very fenfibly impair the characceriftic features of his
people. As ~qually in poitit, and lefs liable to queftion,
we may mention the following ftmilar obfervations.

tures·; the fturdy and generous Briton, notwithftanding
the lhortnefs of the period, and the uninterrupted in-
tercourfe, is traced with uncertainty in the effeminate
and cruel Virginian ; and the negroes in North Ame-
rica, whofo families have continued fince the fuft im-
portation of thefe unhappy creatures, and whofe modes
of living, exclufive.of theidlavery, are not materially
changed, are much lefs remarkable for the flat nofe,
big lips, ugly legs, and long heels, than their anccftors
were, or thart thofe who are diretl:ly importedfrorii the
fame original nation. From thefe obfervations itfeeins
allowable to infer, that though climate, manners, occiP
pation, or imitation, can~ot materially aWea the form
or features of the exifting animal ; yet thefe cirtum-
ftances, becoming the lot of a feries of animals, may,
by inducing a change in the general mafs both of the
.male and female, be the remote caufe of a change in
their product. ·
After what has been premifed, it feems rational to
conclude, that the prolific fluid, in coition, is neither
carried through the Fallopian tubes, nor protrude~
through the aperture of the uterus, to the ovaria ; but
that it is taken up by the ~bforbent veffels, and ~on­
veyed into ~he fanguiferous fyftem ; where indeed every
active principle that can poffibly affect the humari con-
. fiitution is alfo conveyed. That, by circulating through'
the blood, it is, by its natural impulfe and the additional
ftimulus acquired from the mother, forced through the
corrdpqndi1ig veffels into the ovaria; where, if it finds

Mufeum, to which I beg leave to refer the inquifitive
reader.
·The nourilhment of the foetus during all this time,
is derived from the placenta, which is originally farmed
out of that part of the ovum which is next the fundu~
uteri. The remaining part of the ovum is covered
by a membrane calledfpongy .chorion; within which 'is
another called true 'borion, which includes a third,
termed amnios. This~ontains a liquor, or watery fluid,
in which the f~tus floatJ till the time of its birth.
Beforethe child acquires a diftind: and regular form, it
.is called embryo; but, &om the time all its parts become
vifible, it takes and retains the name.off
tetus till its
birth. During the progrefs of impregnation, •the
uterus fulfers confiderable changes ; but, though it
, enlarges as the ovum increifes, yet, in regard to its '
contents, it is never full; for, in early geftation~ thefe
are confined to the fundus only ; and, though the ca-
pacity of the womb increafes, yet it .is not mechani-
cally ftretched, for the thicknefs of its fides do not di-
minilh ; there is'a proportional increafc of the quantity
of fluids, and therefore pretty much the fa.me thicknefs
remains as before impregnation. The gravid uterus
or pregnant womb is of different fizes in diffi:rent wo-·
men, and mufl: vary according to the bulk of the fce-
tus and.involucra. The fituation will alfo vary accord-
ing to the increafe of its contents, and the pofition of
the body. For the firft two or three months, the ca-
vity of the fundus is triangular, as before impregna-
~on; but, as the uter':ls ftr:etches, it gradually acquires

a more rounded .fotm. In general, the uterus never
tifes direCl:ly upwards, .but inclines alittle obliquely,
moft commQnly to the right fide: its pofition is.never, ·
however., fo oblique as to prove the fole caufe, either of
preventing or retarding delivery ; its increafe of bulk
does not feem'to arife merely from' diftention, but to ,. .
depend on the fame caufe and increafe as the extenfion
of the 1kin in a growing child. 'This is ptoved from
fome late inftances of extra-uterine fretu.fes, where the
uterus, though -there were no contents, was nearly of
the fame fize, from the additional quantity of nourifh-
men~ tranfrnitted, as if the ovum had been contained
within its cavity. The internal furface, which is ge-
nerally pretty fmooth, except where the placenta ad-
.heres, is lined with a tender effiorefcence of the uterus,
which, after delivery, appears as if torn, and is thrown
off' with the deanfings. This is the. membrana deci·
dua of Dr. Hunten which he defcribes as a,Iamella
from the inner furface o( the uterus; though Signior
Scarpa, Vfith more probability, confiders it as being
compofed Qf an infpiff~ted coagulable lymph.
TI,.ough the uterus, f~om the moment of ooncep-
tion, is gradually diftended, by which confiderable ·
changes are occafioned, it is very difficult to judge of
, pregnancy from appearances irt the early months. .for
the . fuft three months the os tincre feels fmooth and
even, and its orifice as fmall as in the virgin ftate.
When any difference can be perceived, abOut the fourth
er fifth month, from the defcent of the fundus.through

. tincie will feem larger, and more expanded ; but, efter ·
this period, it fhortens, particularly at itc; fo1"e-parts
and. fides, and its orifice or labia begin to feparate, fo ·
as to have its conical appearance deftroyed. The <:er:-
vix, which in the early months is nearly fhut, now be-
gins to frretch and,to be diftended to the os tincre ;
but, during the whole term of utero-geftation, the
~outh of the uterus.is ftrongly cemented with a ropy
mucus, which lines it and the cervix, and begins to be
difcharged on the approach of1 labour. In the laft
week, when th~ cervix uteri is completely diftended,
·the uteril)e orifice begins to form an elliptical tube, in-
ftead,of a fiffure, or toaffumetheappearanceof a ring
on a large globe; and often at this ,time, efpecially in
' pendulous bellies, <iifappears entirely, fo as to be out
of the reach of the finger in touching. Hence the os .
uteri is not in the direetion of the axis of the womb,
as has generally been fuppofed•.
About the fourth or between the fourth and fifth
.month, the fundus uteri begins to rife above the pubes
or brim of the pelvis, and its cervix to be difi:ended
nearly one third. In the ~h month the belly fwells
like a ball, with the fkin tenfe, the fundus about half
way between the pubes and navel, and the neck one
half diftended. After the fixth month the _greateft
part of the cervix uteri dilates, fo as to make almoft
one cavity with the fund.us. · -In the feventh month the
fundus advances as far as the umbilicus. In the eighth
.it reaches mid-way between the ·navel and fcrobiculus
wrdis; and in the ninth to the fcrobiculus itfelf, the
neck

neck then being entirely diftended, which, with the ds
tincz, become the weakeft part of the uterus. Thus
at full tim~ the.uterus occupies all ·the umbilical and
hypQgaftric regions ; it fhape is alrnoft pyrifor.r;n, 'rllat

The various difeafes incident to the uterine fyftem,

in. weak and fickly females, will frequently excite the
fymptoms, and alfume the appearance, of real preg-
nancy. Complaints ariftng from a fimple obftrudion
are fometitnes mifbken for thofe of breeding ; when a

,Other kinds of fpurious gravidity, lefs hazardous in
their nature than any of the preceding, are commonly
known by the names of faije conception and moles : the
former of thefe is nothing more than the difi"olutjon~f
the fretus in the early months; the placenta is after-
wards ~ned in the womb, and from the addition of
coagula, or in confequence of difeafe, is excluded in an
indurated or enlarged ftate; when it remains longer,
and comes off in the form of a ffe~y or fchirrhous-like
mafs, without having any cavity in the centre, it is
diftinguifhed by the name of mole. Mere coagula of ·

are feldom followed . with da;ngerous confequences.

fler: and thus a monfter may be-either defedive iri its
organic parts, or be fupplied with a fupernumerart fet
of parts derived from .another ovum. This proceedS
from a defed or accident in nature~ which it is entirely'
beyond the power of medicine to ret'l:ify or prevent.
It would feem, however, from a 'due contemplation·
of the foregoing faet:s, from the frame and ftrudure'of
females, and from the ultimate end and purpofe of
theirconformation, that almoft e\rery malady refulting
from a ftate of pregnancy, except the laft-mentioned,
may be in a great meafure prevented or removed. The
natural tempera:tUre of women diff'ers in'a very confi-
derable degree from that of men, inafmuch ·as theit
blood and juices are determined to a peculiar and difl:ind
purpofe ; and hence it is that obftrudions of the men-
fos, their excefs, or privation of the office intended
them, conftitute thofe pecUliar maladies which we term .
Dijeajes of Women. The natural temperature of the
· male, is hot and dry; that of the female,-coldandmoijl.

the woman is LuNAR, i.e. of a cool and vegetative ·

to the fruits of.the earth, fo man fecundates and gives

From what has been fuggefted we might fafely in-
fer, that the conftitution and temperature of the female
requires a medicine of an oppofite ad:ion and tendency
to that agapted to the male, and which ought to be
wmpoqrided .of elements congenial to the intentions of ·
nature, calculated to ·purge the uterus, to purify the
feminal :fluid, and give ftimulus to ,the catamenia;
which, if notput in motion by the funetions of nature,
becomes dull and ftagnant, and vitiates.the whole cir-
culating mafs ; whence thofe diforders, peculiarly in-

LuNAR TINCTURE, as being calculated to atl: up<>n
the menftrual and vegetative fluids, and as being ~om­
pounded of thofe elements which make up the frame
and temperature of her body. The invention of thefe
Tintl:ures hath been the refult of a long and laborious
application to the ftudy of unveiled nature---:of the
properties of fire, air~ earth, and water, in the propa-
gation of animal arld vegetable life, and in the compo-
fttion of medicine ; in which, though thefe elements
form· the PABULUM of the univerfe, yet the art of
colled:ing, uniting, and affimilating, them with the
• vital fluids, feems to be unknown among modern chy-
mifts, and hath efcaped the obfervation of medical fci-
ence. . The fixidity of thefe Tintl:ures at once eftabli1h
their power and efficacy beyond all others ; for they

cligeftiort, to ftimulate their blood and juice!',·and, at
·. the proper age, tc> bring c>n a free and cafy difcharge
of the menilrual flux.-
Though it be uninrfally admitted, that this flux is
abfolutc:ly nec_
dfuy to nourifh and fupport the f~s,
and that witl)out it human generation cannot be car-
ried on ; and that it is confequently and obvioufly pe•

fuhjeCl: delicate females ftill more to that erroneous or
mifguided treatment, by which their ltealth, their life,
and every earthly bl~ng, is too frequently involved.
Dr. Bohn, and Dr. Freind, infift that. this flux is
nothing more than a plenitude of the common mafs
of blood, which nature throws off only for reliefagaini
the too abundant quantity. Dr. Frcindfuppofes, that
.this plenitude arifes from a coacerv:ition in the blood-
veffcls of a fuperfluity of aliment, which, he thinks,
remains over and above what is expended bythe ordi. .
pary ways; and that women have this plethora, and
not men, becaufe their bOdics are more humid, and
~it vcff~s, efpecia.lly the extremities of them, more
tender,

tender, and their manner of living generally triore in- ·
at'l:ive than that of men ; and that thefe things, con-
.curring, are the occafion that women do not perfpire
fufficiently to carry off the fuperfluous alimentary parts,
till .they be accumulated in fuch quantities as to di~end
the vdfels., and force their· way through the capillary
arteries of the uterus. It is fuppofed to happen to
women JllOl"e' than to the females of other fpecies, ·
which have the fame parts, becaufe of the erect poftui:e
of the former, and the vagina and other canals being
perpeml~cular to the horizon; fo that the prefi"ure of
the blood is direet:ed towards their orifices( whereas,.in
brutes, they are paralld to the horizon, and the pref-
fure wholly is on the ftdes of thofe vefie.ls•. The dif-
charge, he thinks, happens in this part rather than in
any other, as being favoured more by the ftrudure of
the veffels ; the arteries being very numerous, and the
veins finous and winding, and therefore more apt to
r,etard the impetus of the blood; and confequently, in
a pl~thoric cafe, to _occafion the rupture of the extre-
mities of the veflels, which may laft, till, by a fufficient
difchar:gc, the veffels are eafed of their overload. To
this he adds the confideration of the foft pulpous tex-
ture' of the uterus, and the. vaft number of veins and
arteries with which it is filled. Hence a healthy maid,
being arrived at her growth, begins to prepare more
nutriment than is required for the fupport of the body;
which, as there is not ·to be any farther accretion, muft
of neccffity fill the veffels, and efpecially thofe of the
uterus an(j. breafts, they being the lea.ft compreffed.

Thefe will.be .dilated more than the others ; ·whence,
the late~ vafcules ·evacuating their humour into.the
cavity of the.uterus, it will. be filled and extended.
Hence a pain, heat, and heavinefs, will be felt about
the loins, pubes, &c. the veifels of the uterus, at the
fame· time, will be fo dilated as to emit bfood in the
.cavity of the _
uterus, and its mouth will be -lubricated
and loofened, and blood iifue out. As the quantity of
blood is diminifhed, the veifels will be lefs preifed, and
will contract; themfelves clofer, fo as again to retain the
blood, and let pafs the groifer part of the ferum ; till
at length only the ufual ferum paifes. , Again, there
are more humours prepared, which are more eaGly
lodged in veifels once dilated ; and hence the menfes
go and return at various periods in various perfons.
This hypothefis isjuditjoufly oppofed by Dr. Drake,
who ·mai~tains, that there is n.o fuch plenitµde, or at
leaft that it is not neceifary to menftruation; arguing,
that, if the me.nfes were owing to a·plethora fo accu-
mulated, the fymptoms would arife .gradually, and the
heavinefs, ftiffnefs, and inadivity, neceifary fymptoms
of a plethora, would be felt long before the periods
were completed, and women would begin.to be heavy
and indi(pofed foon after evacuation, and the fymptoms
would increafe daily; which is contrary to all experi:
ence, many women, who have them regularly and
cafily, having no warning, nor any other rule to prevent
an indecent furprife, than the nieafure of time; in

piore than a plethora, and that there wasfome extraor-
dinary intefl:ine motion at that time.
Dr. Drake contends, that it is not only ~ecefl"ary
there lhould be a ferment, but a receptacle alfo for this
ferment; concluding, from the fuddennefs and violence
pf the fymptoms, that a great quantity muft be con~
veyed tnto the blood in a fhort time, _and confequently
that it mufl: have been i:eady gathered in fome recepta..
cle, where, while itwas lodged, its adion was reftrained~
He pretends to afcertain the place both of the one and
the other, makingthe gall-bladder to be the receptacle,
and the bile the ferment. The liquor he thinks well
~dapted to raife a fermentation in the blood, when dif-
charged into it in quantity; and, as itis contained in a
receptacle that does not admit of a continual ifl"ue, it
·may be there referved, till in a certain period of time
the bladder becoming turgid and full, through the com-
preffion of the· incumbent vifcera, it emits the gall;
which, by the way of the laC\:eals, infinuating itfelfin..
to the blood, may raife that effervefcence which occa-
ftons the aperture of the uterine arteries. To confirm
this, he alledges, t~at perfo.p.s of a bilious conftitution
have the menfes either more plehtfully, or more fre-
quently, than others; and that d.ifie.mpeirs manifeilly
bilious are attended with fymptoms refembling thofe
of women labouring under difficult menftruatioQ.
But,, if this argument. be admitted, men would have
the menfes as well as women. To this however he
anfwers, that men do not abound in bile fo much'as
women, the pores of the former being more open, and

carrying off more of the ferous part of the blood,
which is the vehicle of all other humours, and conf<':-
quently a greater part of each is difcharged through
them than in women, wherein the fuperfluity muft
, either continue to circiµate with the blood, or be ga-
thered into proper receptacles, which is the caie in the
bile. The fame reafon he gives why menftruatlon
lhould not be in brutes : the .Pores of thefe being ma-
nifeftly more open than thofe of women, as appears
from the quantity of hair 'Yhich they bear, for the ve-
getation whereof a large cavity, and.a wider aperture
of the glands, is neceff'ary,. than where no fuch thing
is pro4uced : yet there is fome differen~e between the
males and females even among thefe, fome of the lat-
ter having their menfes, fuch as the orang outang, &c.•
though not fo often, nor in the fame form and quantity,
as women. But without dwelling on thefe abftra&.
reafonings, the abfurdity of which will he obvious to
every p~rfon who turns to the foregoing fyftem of hu-
man impregnation, we need only remark, that there are
two critical periods in every woman•s life that com-
pletely deftroy their hy,Pothefrs. Thefe are, that at the
age of fourteen or fifteen, the menfes begin to flow;

to the foregoing aoCl:rine, they would then always flow
with the greateft freedom. At the period when they
lhould ceafe, they are apt to come in fuch abundance
as to bring on a flooding, which not only endangers,
but too frequently deftroys, life-·-a fatal confequence
that could not ~ffibly happen, were the above argu-
ments true.
· OF FEMININE OR LUNAR DISEASES.
That the ve_getative or procreative faculties of wo..
men are univerfally governed by the lunations of th~
moon, their own experience, as well as the demonfl:ra-
ti~ns given in my Treatife on the Occult Sciences, in-
difputably prove. The firft fhow of the catamenia, if
it be natural, invariably comes with the new or full
moon; or fometimes, though very feldom, at the com-
mencement of her firft or laft quarters ; and this effort
of nature is juftly confidered as the fore fign of.a pro-
.creating ability, and of complete puberty. Whenever
this feafon arrives, whether early or late, the confl:itu-
. tion of every female'undergoes a confiderable change,
and the greateft care and attention are then neceffary,
fmce the future health and happinefs of every woman
depend, in a great meafure, upon her conduct: at this
period. It is the duty of mothers, and of thofe who
are intrufted with .the education of girls, to in~ruct
them early in the condud: and managem.ent of them-
felves at this critical moment. Falfe modefty, inat-
tention, and ignorance of what is beneficial or hurtful
at this time, are the fources of many difeafes and mif-

fortunes, which·a very little attention might now pre~
'vent. Nor is care lefs necefTary in the fubfequent re-
.turns of this clifcharge. Taking improper food, vi()-
icnt agitatic:>ns of the. mind, or catching cold, is often
{ufficient to ruin the health, or to render the female for
ever after incapable of procreation.
In order to efcape the chlorofis, and other fimilar
difeafes, incident to young women at that period when
the menfes commence, let them avoid indolence and
jnaCl:ivity, and accuftom themfelves to exercife in the
open air as much as poffible. The difcharge in the
beginning is feldom fo inftantaneous as to furprife them
·unawares. . The e~uption is . generally preceded by
fymptoms that indicate its approach ; fuch as a fenfe
of heat, weight, and dull pain in ~e loins ; diftenfton .
arid hardnefs of the hreafts, head-ach, lofs of appetite,
laffitude, palenefs of the countenance, and fometimes
a flight degree of fever. When thefe fymptoms oc~
cur, every thing fhould be carefully avoided which
tnay obftruct the difcharge, and all gentle means ufed
to promote it; as fitting frequently over fteams oi
warm water, drinking warm diluting ·liquor8, &c,
When the menfes have begun to flow, great care fhould
be taken to avoid every thing that tends to obfuuet
them; fuch as falt-fifh, and all kinds of food that are
hard of digeftion, and cold acid liquors. Damps are
likewife hurtful at this period; as alfo ariger, fear,
_grief, and other affeCl:ions of the mind. From what~

cool, air, wholefome diet, generous liquors in a weak:
and languid ftate of the body, chearful company) and
.amufement, fail, recourfe mutt: be·had to medicine. In
all fuch cafes blood-letti~g mutt: be carefully avoided;
butl:t the patient take from twenty to thirty drops of
the Lunar Tincture, in a wine-glafs of warm-water or
mugwort tea, every morning before breakfaft, every
day at noon, and every night before going to bed, un-
til the intention be anfwered, which will ufually take
place in three or four days, without the affiftance of
any other .medicine whatever. But it fometimes hap-
-pens, in relaxed conftitutions, that the menftrual dif-
charge, on its firft appearance, is vitiated, and over
abµndant; the confequence ofwhich is, thatthe patient
becomes weak, the colour pale, the appetite impaired,
and the digeftion languid, fo that dropfy, or confump-
tion, is likely to enfue. Effe8:ually to prevent thefe,
let the patient be kept two or three days in bed, with
her head low, and obferve a llender diet, principally of
white meats, and her drink red-port negus. Every
night and morning for ten or twelve days, let her take.
one tabk-fpoonful of the Solar Tincture, diluted in
double the q.uantity of decoction of nettle-roots, orof
the greater comfrey ; and after the :flux ha$ abated,
and her health and ftrength feem to return, let her only
take .a table-fpoonful of the Solar Tincture every day
at noon, iµ a glafs of cold fpring-water; which won-

' C A S E.
Being called to the affiftance of a young lady of fif-
teen years of age, I was informed her menfes had made
.an irregular appearance about five or fix times, coming
firft with the full and then with the new moon, and
.afterwards at the diftance of two or three months apa~t
until they totally difappeared, and turned back upon
the habit. No notice was taken, until the patient was
· feized with a violent bleeding at the nofe, attended
with fever and epileptic fits. After being ·under the
care of an eminent phyfician for feveral months, who
direded venefed:ion, and almoft every cuftomary ap-
plication, to no kind of purpofe, the diforder fixed.in
her neck, forming a large tumour, the acrimony of
which fell upon her lungs, and threw her into fi:rong
~onvulfions. In this extremity I was fent for. Per-

firft object was to relieve the vital organs, by giving
force and elaA:icity to the circulating mafs. With this
view I with difficulty forced the mouth fuffi.ciently
open to adminiA:er one table-fpoonful of the Solar
Tincture undiluted; and' within half an hour, to the
afl:onifhment of her friends, I had the pleafure of fee-
·ing every convulfive fymptom die away, and of hearing
the patient's voice, of which fhe had been totally de-
prived for upwards of a week before. Two hours af-
.ter, another fpoonfol of the Solar Tincture was taken
with additional fuccefs; and the patient afterwards con-
tinued this medicine in the quantity of a table-fp~on­
ful, in a wine-glafs of warm water, three times a day,
·for fix days, at the expiration of which time her appe-
tite and ftrength were furprifmgly returned ; and fhe
·was then put under a regular courfe of the Lunar
TinCl:ure. Twenty drops.,, in awine-glafs of mugwort
tea, were taken every night and morning for thirteen
fucceffive days; and on the morning following, it being
the full moon, with which her menfes originally came,
ihe had the confolation to find that every obftrudion
was removed, and that the due courfe of nature wa.S
completely re-eftablifhed. The glandular fwellings
gradually fubficied, her natural complexion quickly re-
turned, and fhe now continues in blooming health,.

This difeafe ufually attacks virgins a little after the
.time of puberty, and firft: 1hews itfelf by fymptoms of
tlyjpepjia or bad digeftion~ But a diftingui1hing fymp-
tom is, that the appetite is entirely vitiated, and the
patient will eat lime, chalk, allies, (alt, &c. very gree-
dily ; while at the fame time there is not only a.total
inappetence to proper food, but itwill even excite nau-
fea and vomiting. · In the beginningof the difeafe, the
urine is pale, and afterwards turbid ; the face becomes _
pale, and then affumes a greenifh colour ; fometimes ,it
becomes livid or ye!low, the eyes are funk, and have
a livid circle round them ; the lips lofe their fine red
colour; the pulfe is quick, weak, and low, though the
heat is little fhort of a fever, but the veins are fcarcely
filled; the feet are frequently cold, fwell at night, and
th.e whole body feems covered with a foft fwelling; the
the breathing is difficult : nor is the mind free from
agitation' as well as the body; it becomes irritated by
the flightefl: caufes ; and fometimes the patients love
folitude, and become fad and melancholy. There is
a retention of the-menfes throughout the whole courfe
.of the diforder; which eventually fix on the vital or-
gans; and death enfues.

of God, " encreaft and multiply," is moft: fenfibly im.-
, pre.tTed upon the whole human fabric. Every tube and
ve.tTel appertaining to the genital fyflem, being now fil-
led with a procreative liquor, excites in the female a
powerful, yet perhaps involuntary, irritation of the
parts, which flrongly folicits the means of difcharging
their load by venereal embraces. Thefe, from pru-
dential motives, being often necefi"arily denied, the

whole body, and quidcly devotes the unhappy patient

remark, are thoufands of the moft delicate and lovely

heft method of regimen is laid down in my Family
Phyftcian, page '21.7> which, if weHobferved; in addi-
tion to the following courfe, will generally perform a.
cure. Take leaves of mugwort, briony, and penny-
royal, of each an handful ; infufe them four. days in
·two quarts of foft water, and then pour off the clear ·
liquor for ufe. Take a gill-glefs.three parts full, with
thirty drops of the LuNAR TINCTURE added to it,
three·times a day, viz. morning, noon, and night, till
the decodioh be all ufed. Then reduce the dofe to
twenty drops of the Tindure in a·wine-glafs of cold
fpring-water morning and evening, for fifteen days;
after which it fhould be taken only once a day, or every ,
other day, until'the patient finds herfelf entirely free
&om every fymptom 'of thedi(eafe. For this malady,
it is the only fpecific hitherto known ; .it-unclogs the
genital tuhes, purges and cools the uterus and vagina, .
promotes the menftrual difcharge, cleanfes the urinary
pa1fages, diffolves vifcid humours in the blood, fhatp-
ens the appetite, ft~mulates the nerves, and invigorates
the fpirits, which fo all ftages of cblorofis are fo apt to

the fame deplorable circnmftances. The following is
a literal ftatement of the
CA S E. • ·
A young lady, tumedof feventeen, had been afilided
with chlorojis almofl: three years. In the early part of
the malady, fhe conceived an unconquerable appetite
for wood..cinders, concreted morta'r,_tobacco-pipes,
fealing-wax, &c. Her courfes appeared at different
intervals of the difeafe, but always irregular, and more
or lefs in,a vitiated fl:ate. About half a year preceding
my attendance, this flux had totally ceafed ; but, upon .
the approach of every new moon, with which her men..
fes originally came, fhe was ·affiicted with pains in the.
back and Joins, heavinefs and turgidity about the region.
of the womb, and other cufl:omary fymptoms of the
catamenia ; yet not the fmalleft fhow could be brought
to appear. A little· before this, the lady's atTeetion1
· had been placed on a young man in the neighbourhood,
but ~hofe fituation in life was by no means on a fcalc
adapted to the views of her father and family. Th•
moment therefore this attachment was difcovered, th&
lady was confinedto her apartment, and neither fuffered
to take exercifeor frefh air, but when it fuited forfome ·
trufty attendant to accompany her. This confinement·
lteightened her difeafe, and brought on afettled melan-
~holy, a green fallow complexion, dejeeted fpirits, uni-
verfal laffitude, and wailing of the fiefh. The mor-
bid £-l:ate of her body having thus undermined her

father's care, the diforder fell upon.the vital organs,
and with {o rapid a.progrefs, that within twenty-four
hours ihe was feized with an ardent fever, attended with
lofs of appetite, delirium, and a total privation of
(peech. In this lhock.ing fl:ate fhe had .the alternate
advice of three phyficians of the firft re(pedability ;
but the di(order increafing, and putting on the moft:
dangerous fymptoms, after having bafBed their utmoft:
fkill, a confultation was had, and the miferable patient
was configncd, to the.grave.
Under thefe deplorable circumfl:ances it was my .lot
to be called in; and, upon a clofe examination of the
patient, fcarccly any viftble ftgns of life remained.
The pul(e had nearly fubfided. The ad:ion of the
heartand lungs could fcarcely be difcemed. The eyes
were funk, and fixed; yet retained an uncommonlook
of exprdlion and fentiment. At this time fhe had a
large blifter round her neck, another on the pit of her
ftomach ; a third, very large, between her fhoulders ;
a fourth on her head; a fifth, and ftxth, infide the an-
c,
les and legs. Venefed:ion had been fo often.repeated,
that fcarce blood enough rem,aincd to fupport the heat
and ad:ion of the heart. In this exhaufl:ed fl:ate, I
only adminiftered three tahle-fpoonfuls of the Solar
Tind:ure, ttndiluted, at intervals of little more than an'
hour apart; and, in the fpace of four hours after, I had
the heart-felt fatisfad:ion of feeing the energy of the
blood reftored ; pulfation gradually refurned its aaion;·

completely anfwered; for nature, affifted by nouri1hing
food, eff'etl:ed more than a profufton of drugs ; fo that,
in little more than twenty days, my patient was able to
walk her room, and to put herfelf under a '9\lne of

great as almoft to exceed belief. Yet the iady and her
worthy parent, are ~ a:ll times ready to authenticate
the faet, to any reputable enquirer, or to the friends of
any unfortunate female labouring under a; ftrµilar af..
flietion.
Or THE FLUOR ALBUS, OR WHITES.
The fluor albus, female weaknefs, or whites, as it
is commonly called, is a difeafe of the womb and its
contiguous parts; from which a pale-coloured;,green•
ilh, or yellow, fluid, is difcharged, attended with lofs of
ftrength, pain in the loins, ba.d·digeftion, ·and a wan
fickly afpeet. The quantity, colour, and conftftence,
of the difcharge, chiefly depend upon the time of its
duration, the patient's habit of body, and the nature
()f the caufe by which it was produced. weakly
women of lax folids, who have had many child!en, and
long·laboured under ill h!!alth, are of all the·moft fub~
jeCl: to this difagreeable difeafe ; from which they un-
furtunately fuffer more fevere penance than others, as
the niceft fenfations are often conneCl:ed with fuch a de-
licacy of bodily frame as fubjeCl:s them to it. In_Hol~
land if is very frequent, and in a manner peculiar to the:
place, from the darnpnefs of its fttuation ; the- fur-
iounding air being fo overcharged with moifture as to
relax the body, ftop perfpiration, and throw it. upon
the bowels Or womb ; producing in the firft a diarrhrea-
or flux, in the laft the fiuor albus or female weakne{S.

'fientto menfuuation; becaufe; in delicate habits, where
thofe veffels are weak; and confequently remain too long
uncontra~ed, the fluor albus fometimes immediately '
follows the menfes, and goes off by degrees as they.
gradually clofe. It alfo comes from the mucus glands
of the womb, as is particularly evident in very young
females of eight or ten years old; in whom, though
very rarely, it has been obferved, and where it muft
then neceffarily have efcaped from thofe parts, as the
uterine veffels are not fufficiently enlarged for its paf-
fage at fo early a period.
Sometimes, as in women with- child, it proceeds
from the·paffage to the womb, and not from the womb
' itfelf; which, during pregnancy, is clofely fealed up,
fo that nothing can pafs from thence till the time of
labour. The 'application of thofe inftruments called

a ftrain of the back and loins. In the firft cafe, the
difcharge being generally mild, may be~eaftly taken
away. In the fecond, it may proceed from a vitiated
or impure blood, where the body, from thence, isloaded
with grofs humours~ which nature for her own fecurity .

the difcharge is often of a reddifh colour, like that from
old ulcerous fores ; being fometimes fo 1harp as to ex•
coriate the contiguous·parts, .and ·occafion a fmarting
and heat of urine. A deep-feated darting pain, wfth
a forcing down, 'attending fuch a difcharge, is a very
·dangerous and alarming fign, and indicates an ulcerated
or cattcerous womb. This malignant fta~e of the dif-
eafe, if of long continuance, is· extr7mely difficult of ·
·cure ; and difpofes the patient to b~rennefs, a bearing
down, dropfy, or confumption. In fhort,; as this is a
malady of the moft difagreeable kind, which by long
continuance or negleCl:: becomes difficult 9f cure, and
often proves fatal, it were to be wi1hed that women, on

occafion for her d9ubts or not. A frefu infeaion, called
gonnorrhcea, is malignant and inflammatory; the fluor
albus moft commc;mly arifes from relaxation and bodily
weaknefs : and therefore the remedies proper in the .
firft diforder would render the laft more violent; by
locking up and confining the infeetious matter. Li
the gonorrhcea, the difcharge chiefly proceeds from the
parts contiguous.to the urinary pa.B'age, and continues
. whilft the menfes How ; butin the fluor albus it is fup-
plied from the cavity of the womb and its pafTage,
and then the menfes are feldom regular. .In the go...
norrhcea, an itching, inflammation, and heat of urine,
are the fore-runners of the difcharge ; the orifice of
the urinary pa1fage is prominent, and the patient is af...
feeted ·with a frequent irritation to make water. In the
fl.uor albus, pains in dte loins, and lofs of ftrcngth, at-.
tend the difcharge ; and, if any inflammation or heat
of urine follow, they hap,Pen in a lefs degree, and only
after a long continuance of the difcharge, which, be_..
coming fuarp and acdmonious, excoriates the fw:rowid-
ing ~arts. ln the gonorrh~a, the difcharge fuddenly
appears, without any ev..ident caufe; but in the auw
albus, it comes on more llowly, and is of~'pr~uced.

the time of impregnation, was the cafe of a man who a·
few years fince kept a public houfe in Tooley-ftreet,
Southwark. His father was a white nian, -belonging
to one of theweit-India:packets; ana his mother was
a negro girl; whom he had taken a fancy to, and pur-
chafed ~n the arrival of one of the Guinea 1lave-1hips
at the ifiand of Jamaica. He brought her with him
to London, arid in the courfe of the enfuing year, fhe
was delivered of a fon, the whole -
right fide ·of which
was white like the father ; but the whole of the left
fide was black like the mother. As he grew up, this
vifible diftinetion became more ftrongly marked ; and
during the time he kept the above public-houfe fu Too-

of people, who flocked there to fpend their mite, in

brown, like that of the father ; and half the face, neck~

A ftill more curious and{\rikinge~ple ofthis afto.
ni.fhing effort in the male and female procreative ft.uids,
is verified in the cafe of Mr. John Clark, of Prefcot-
ftreet, Goodman's-fields. His father was a native o(
Africa, who, by dint of good fortune, had amalfed a
confiderable fum of money., and fettled in London.
He married a remarkably healthy young woman, a
native of Devonlhire, who had been fome time his
fervant. By her he had two fons and three daughters,
who were mulattos, except the eldeft fon, .who was the
firft born, and the perfon above alluded to. Fro~th~
head to the navel, all round his body,·he was remark-
ably fait, had a fiQ.e fkin, ·handfome round features,
light-brown hair, and fanguine complexion, like his
mother; but from the navel d9wnwards he was com-
pletely black, with lhort black woolly hair on the pri-
vities, exactly like d!e father. . At the age of thirty,
he married a young lady of good family and fortune,
but of a. delicate dirpofition. For near three months
he had the addrefs·to conceal this deformity of colour
from the knowledge of his wife, by wearing fleih-co•
loured ftlk drawers and ftockings, which he pretended
were lined with flannel to keep off the rheumatitm,
with which he had been foiely affiid:ed:, even to a degree
that endangered his lif~, every time he attempted~
leave them off. It happened however, from fume
negled: of concealment before going to fieep, that the
curiofity of his wife was ftrongly excited; and the op-
portunity proving favourable in other refpeds, it being

pulation of a black man with i. white woman Hath often produced
a pied or fpotted race, living inftances of which are to be found in·
1.loth the Indies. A very remarkable cafe is that of Maria Herig,
whqwas fpotted all over the body, and covered with hair, like the
leopard. She WJs.born at Dackftull in Lorraine in 1770, and was
exhibited in Paris in 1774-· Both the fkin and the hair were of a
tan-colour ; and ·befides thefe hairy fpots, her ftomach and belly
were covered with hmgi!h hair, of a brown colour on one fide, and
lighter on the other.-Somewhat fimilar~ and not lefs remarkable,
was tfie porcupine man, who was born in Suffolk in 1710, and was
exhibited in every principal town in England. The fkin of his bo-
dy was covered with excrefcencrslike thorns or prickles ; andabout
the'thicknefs of packthread. His face, the palms of his hands,
and the foles of. his feet, were the only· parts that were' free from
them. They were of a reddifu brown, and.had foch a degree of
hardnefs and elafticity, as _
to rattle when the hand was moved over
the body. They were half an inch long in fomc parts, and lborter
in others. They did not appear till two months after his birth; but,
what is moll extraordinary, they dropped off every winter,and were
renewed in the fpring. He had fix children, all of whom~ li1'.e

admitted by many eminent prad:itioners, that the dif..,.
eafes incident to a pregnant ftate i~ the early months
ari(e frotn fympathy ; whilft thofe peculiar to the more
advanced. ftages of .geftation, are produced by the
ftretching and prefi"ure of the uterus on the contigu-
. ous vifcera. Thus heart-burn and dian:hrea, tenfton
and pains of the breaft, naufea and head-ach, deftre of
unnatural food, tremors, and dejed:ed fpirits, fainting ,
and hyfteric fits, premature mertftfuation, and confe-

ftrengthening bitters, and medicines calc_ulated to give

purify the grofs and vifcid elements which opprefa the

STATE OF WOMEN AT THE TURN OF LIFE.
The moft critical and dangerous time of a woman's
life is that wherein the menfos ceafe to Bow, which
ufually happens between forty and fifty years of age.
The great change that this produces, by fo copious a
drain being turned into the habit without previous
preparation, is the fole caufe of its danger. Every
woman muft be mote or lefs fenfible when this period
arrives, and lhould conduc9: herfelf accordingly ; for,
when the menfes are about to go off, they appear for
the moft part irregularly, both in time and quantity,
on<;e !µ a fortnight, three, five, or fix, weeks,; fome..

times very fparingly, and at other times in immoderate
quanttttes. For want only' of neceifary care and at-
. tention, during the time that the menfes thus give
fymptoms of their departure, many-
and various are the .
complaints that enfue ; amongft which are cold chills,
fucceeded by violent flulhings of the face, and heats of
the extremities ; reftlefs nights, troublefome dreams,
and unequal fpirits ; inflammations' of the bowels ;
fpafinodic affedions; ftiffnefs in the limbs, fwelled
. ancles, fore legs, with pains and inflammation ; the
the piles, and other fymptoms of plenitude. JJut all
this might eafily be prevented, by attending to a due
regimen, and taking thefe Tindures, as occafion may
require. Whenever a woman has reafon to fufped: her
menfe~ are about to leave her, let her lofe four, five, or
1ix, ounces of blood, as her habit of body will adnlit i,
..
th~n let her make a decod:ion, by taking gentian-roots,
one pound ; fenna and orange:..peels, of each half a
pound; pour upon them a gallon of hot water, and,
after it has ftood twenty-four hours, pouroff the liquor
for ufe. · Let her take from twenty to forty drops of
the Lunar Tindure in a gill:..glafs full of the above
decoCt:ion, every night and morning for ten days ; tfien
let her continue it every morning for ten days more,
and afterwards once every two or ~hree days, oroftener

When the ntf"Vu going toany part are tied or cut, the
part becomes paralytic, apd lofes all power of motion J
but it does not mortify. If the artery be cut, the part _,
dies, and mortification enfues. What keeps it alive in
the 'firft cafe ? nothing but the living principle, which ,,
alone can keep it alive ; and this phenomenon is inex..
plicable on any other fuppofttion, than that.the life is
contained in the blood. Another arQ'.ument is drawn
....
by.Mr. Hunter from a cafe of a fractured os humeri.
A ·man was brought into St. George~s Hofpital for a
fimple fracture of the os humeri or arm, and died about
a month after the accident. . As the bones had not
united, Mr. Hunter injected the arm after death. He
found that the cavi~y ·between the extremities of the
bones was filled up with blood which Jtad coagulated.
This blood was become vafcular, orfull of vetfels. In
fome places it was very much fo. He does not main-
tain that all coagulated blood becomes vafcular : ~d
indeed the reafon is obvious ; for it is often thrown
out and'. coagulated in parts where its becoming vafcu-
iar cow.d anfwer no end in the fyfl:em : as, for example,
in the cavities of aneurifmal facs. If it be fuppofed,
, that, in 1uch cafes as ·that jufl: now mentioned, the
vetrels,are not formed in the coagulum, but come from
the neighbouring arteries, it is equally an argument
that the blood is alive : for the fubftance into which

a:nuttitiouS:.Buid is the immediate origin of the(e fame
~rves, and of that very nervous. fluid. N<>w we
know, that the fluid which in the womb nourifh~ the
&odies of all embryo animals, is neceff'arily equivalent
to the bloodwhich nourifhes the bodies of adult ones ;
and confequently, as foon as the blood became the only
nutritiousjuiceof the body, at .
that fame time the ner- ·
vous fluid took llP its reftdence there, and from t)ie
blood diffufe~I: itfdf along the nerves, where it was
regulated elPlCtly according to the model originally
formed in the embryo. · Perhaps it may be faid,:that
the ,vital .power, when once it hath taken poffeffion of ·
the human:or any o~er body, requires no addition o.r .
fupply, but continues there in the .Wn.e quantity from
Jitii to la.ft. If .we fuppofe the nervous power to be
immaterial, this will indeed be the c~e, and there is an
end of reafoning upon the fubjett ; bu.t,_
if we call this
power a volatile and elaftic fluid, it is plain $t there
will be more occafton for recruits to fuch a power than .
to any other fluid of the body, as'its volatjlity and elaf-
ticity will promote its efcape in greatquantities through
cv~ry pore of the body. It may perhaps be obje&d,
th3t.it is abfurd to fuppofe the blood capableof putting
matter in fuch a form as to dire8: its own motions in a
particular way : out even of this we have ~ pofitive
proof in the cafc of the ele&ic fl.uid. For if any

tity of.blood is carried to the btain, and the minute
arteries end in thefe fmall glands, it follows, that the
nervous fluid m1tft comefrom tbe h/ood. Now, there is
no gland whatever, in .the human or any other body,

feld9m, it is with great difficulty that a fubjeet of this
delicate and abftrufe nature can be treated with perfpi-
cuity, and is the principal caufe why-it has not been at-
. tempted by former phyfiologilts. · I have already fhewn,
that the rudiment;S of the embryo puts forth foqr mem-
. branes, viz. the placenta; the navel-ftring, the chorion,
arid amnios, \v1'ich contain the fluid abo've-mentioned,
in which the fa:tus floats. · Until the period of quick-
~ning arrives, ··the; .embryo poffeffes only vegetative
. life, fmill:u to that of·a common plant ; and its growth
is nourifhed and prefeived by the fluid in which it
fwims, until the nerves; veins, arteries, and vital organs,
· art entirely formed, and the circulation.of its mother's
blood is completed through them, which is condueted
in the following manner. .
The placenta is the medi~m by which the blood'from
· the heart of the mother is communicated to that of
the child; but·to check its too rapid progrefs, which
· would overwhelm the tender veffds of theinfant frame,
the texture of the-placenta is formed funilar to that of

the ~ir~ulation of the blood #lrough_the heart is not .
cpndq&eQ. in the f~tu~ a,s in the adult: in the latter>
the blood is carried from the right auride of the heart
through the pulmonary artery, and is retl.irri~ tQ the
left _
auricle by the pulmonary vein ; but a dilatation of
the lungs is elfential to the palfage of the blood through. ,
the pulmonary velfels; and·this dilatation cannot, take.
place till after the child is born, and has refpired•.

an immediate communication between the right. and·

not the means of applying for medical affiftance.
The infinit!! variety of complaints an impure or in-
fected ftate of the blood induces, almoft exceeds be-
lief; and hence the new and deceptive forms a fcro-
phulous or fcorbutic taint puts on, which often deceive
the m.oft eminent of the faculty, and· baRle the beA:
intention towards a cure. An impure or fcrophulous
taint will invade.the nobleA: organs of the human frame,
before the patient can be aware of his danger. In the
firft ftage of its vifible dfe&, a weary pain feizes the
joints and mufdes, attended with·a wafting of the legs
and loins. In the fecond ftage the gums fwell, grow
painful, hot, and irritable, and bleed upon the fiighteft
prdfure ; the roots of the teeth become bare ~d loofe,
and the breath naufeous. In the third ftage, the gwna
grow putrid, the teeth black and rotten, the fublingu-
lar veins become -varicofe, and the breath cadaverous ;
' fretid blood dift.ils frem the lips, gums, mouth, nofe,
lungs, ftomach, liver, fpleen, pancreas,inteftines,womb,
kidneys, &c. fcabs and ulcers break out in all·parts of
the body, and the joints, l?ones, and.vifcera, become
morbid. In the fourth ftage) putrid, eruptive, Md
fpotted, fevers enfue, wbich end in an atrophy, -or dfe
follow diarrhceas, dyferttery, dropfy, confumption, pal-
fy, contndions, melancholy, and all the long and

The intention of all thefe remedies is to impregnate
the blood with qualities oppofite to thofe with which it
is infeCl:ed; and this muil be done in a fuperior degree
of force and power, before a cure can be completed.
But thefe medicaments are often adminifl:ered under
fuch naufoous forms, and in fo crude and unqualified a
ftate, that ·they not only torture the patient, but mifs
·.entirely their intended-aim. The naufeous tafte of
medicine is nothing but its. groffer particles ; which,
inftead of entering the ftomach, to irritate and opprefa
·its organs, ought to be drawn off by chemical procefs;

for it is th~ occult virtue of every d~ug~ not its groff'er

grateful to the ftomach. It flies immediately to the
heart, whether internally or externally applied, blends

it generates, corre&s, warms, purifies, animates, and
impels, through the whole fyftem. It cleanfes all the
vifcera~ and glandular parts, particularly the lungs and
kidneys ; ftimulates the fibres, whereby the gaftric
juice and digeftion are promoted; diffolves vifcid hu-
·mours, and expels infedion: It exerts very confide- ·

the pulfe, ftrengthens the folids, and invigorates the
animal fpirits. It penetrates into the moft intimate
parts, opens the mouths of the minuter veffels, reftores

invigorate the mufcular fyftem ; to animate the fpirits J
and renovate the whole man, whereby the chill watery

dry, and fometimes moift, fcabs and tumotirs on the
1kin. Being negled:ed, it atlength pervaded the whole
fyf!:em, till, turning inwardly, it'fell upon his lungs,
and reduced him to the laft ftage of a confumption.
In this deplorable ftate, given over by the faculty, left
· totally emaciated, and incapable of turning in his bed,

he fortunately had recourfe to the Solar Tintl:ure.
The firft dofe was given undiluted, which threw him
into a fine perfpiration, and compofed him to fleep,
w,hich had long been a ftranger to his eyes. After·
one large bottle had been adminiftered agreeable to the
bill of direRions, at the end of a week he was fo much
· reftored, that with very little affiftance he was enabled
to put on his own clothes ; and, after continuing the
medicine for little more than a month, he was able to
walk abroad. And now, after having continued the
Tintl:ure night and morning, and occafionally uftng it
as a beverage made fimilar to warm brandy and water,
he has quite recovered his former health and ftrength ;
being, to the furprife of every body who beheld him
in his late emaciated condition, as robufi: and hearty as
itis well poffihle for a man to he. ·

to he open and· candid, to relate to me his real fitua-
'tion, and.not apretended one, which Was only to impofe
on his own underfl:anding. He thanked me for the
tehuke---faid he would be frank, and in a few words
declared, That from exceffive lull:, and continual de-
bauch, he had'loll his virility ; and, to add to the mis-
. fortune, he was really on the eve of enteri~g into the
marriage ftate. In other refpeels he felt no diminution
in his health or conftitution ; and from external ap-
~, this was furely the !aft imperfedion that
could have been fu(peeted. His complexion was vi-
gorousand lively, his fie{h firm, and conformation ex- '
cellent; yet, notWithftanding this, he was impotent to~
fbch a degreei that neither theftrength of his own de-
fires,, ~or the ·excitations of the female, could affea
the part. It often happens, that though the organs
remain found, yet if the nervous and feminal fluids
have degenerated.from a healthful ftate---if they are
impaverHhed by being too muth drained, or turned in-
to an unnatu~ courfe, they cannot then perform their.
office, by reafon that their moving pow~rs, 'and ftimu-
lus on the blood, are become too weak to direet their
fOrce ~d aetion in the manner nature requires in the
aaof copulatiob. I therefore enjoined him to abftain
entirely from all attempts of the kind, for three monthS
at leaft ; direaed the ointment as in page 240 of the

Little more than three months ago, a gentleman.
about.fifty years of age, lately returned from theEaft.:.

fable beauties of Bengal---had undergone a mercurial
· ialivation, and appeared to be inking under an·univerfal
langour and debility of the whole mufcular fyftem..
The fphin~er of the bladderwas fo weakened, that the-
urinary fecretion came from him by drops, in fo per-
petual and involunµ.ry a manner, as notto be perceived
until the moifture of QJl.e fet of cloths became fo fen-
fibly affiieting, as made itneceifary tofupply frdh ones,

fun¢t:ions were diffipated and relaxed, the tone of the
ftomach and vifcera was n~ly gone, the tremulou~

and once or twice a day afterwards, as occafion might-
feem to render necdfary. Before the expiration of'
twenty days, the, fphincter mufcle acquired its proper
tone, the pulfe became fhong and regular, and the ner-
'vous tremors were confiderably abated. By the end
of the fecond month, a renovation of the whole animal
~conomy feemed to ~ave taken place, and avifible ac-
cumulation of blood and juices had retrieved the cir-
culation. Before the expiration of three months, I
had the gratification to fee this patient completely re-
frored to fuch a ftate of bodily health and ftrength, as
utterly aftoni1hed himfelf,-after taking only eight large
bottles of the Solar Tincture.
HYPOCHONDRIACAL DEBILITY, OR WEAK. NERVES.
A gentleman in Oxford1hire lately came to town on
purpofe to confult me.in this complaint. He appeared
~o be near thirty years of age, of middling ftature, but
Of a weakly conftitution. He had for upwards of
feven years paft paid his addreffes to a lady, whom he
had long prornited1 and very much defired, to marry;
but whenever he propofed in his mind to fix the day,
or whenever it happened that he attempted to falute or
embrace' her,.he was fuized with an unaccountable tre-
ip~r .of 0e w};ole body, .his fpirits funk, his virility
left him, and a violent palp~tatio'n of the heart enfued.
In 1hort~ he was fo diftruftful of his own powers, that
he confeffed it was the fear.of not b~ing able to perform
th~ ~ites of the marriage-bed that had been the only

day. This is certainly a moft fingular inftance of the
hypodiondriacal affed:ion, and of its derangement of
·the nei-Vous fyfl:em. The debility induced by it feems
to arife from the weaker <:nergy of ~he brain, the fault
of which however, cannot be deted:ed by the niceft
anatomifl:. For this reafon, we do not well know how
fuch defed: fhould be reftored; but as nature, feeming-
.'ly for this purpofe, excites the motion of the heart and.
arteries, we inuft afcribe the continuance of fuch debi.
lity to the too weak re-ad:ion of the fanguiferous fyf-
tem~ The heart will generally palpitate from a violent
excitement of the nerves, efpecially wh~n the blood is
endowed with too fmal} a fhare of ftimulus. Hence
palpitation from any affed:ion of the mind, and from
hyfterics in women. Under whatever circumftances
this hypochondriacal affed:ion happens, it debilitates
the whole animal machine, and renders the perfon un-
able to perform the proper offices of life.· The prof-
tration of fpirits, weak.nefs, and langour, are often fur-
prifingly great, though the pulfe feems tolerably flrong,
as being heightened by animal ·defire. The effect,
however, is fore to produce a·languid circulation, the
·blood ·.feeming to adhere, with uncommon energy,
about the region of the heart. I fufped: it is in thefe
cafes that cantharides are moft frequently ufed. The
patient acknowledged, after fome hefitation, .that he
had tried them; but they only produced an involuntary
thoug~ violent ered:ion, by no means adapted to the
cure, nor to the purpofe he intended. Hence this re-
~eqy is not only inadequate~ but extremelydangero\ls;

·for it too much exhaufts the.vital powers, and is fol-
.lowed by a vaA: dejedion of fpirits, tremors, ftartings
of the tendons, &c. which bring on rigours, cold
clammy fweats, fyncope, and premature death. ·
The means, therefore,·which nature points out for
the cure of this fP.Cdes of debility, are direaed to fup·
-port and increafe.the adion of the blood through the
.heart and arteries ; and the remedies to be employed
are tonics and ftimulants~ Ofall the ftimulants, which
in thia coriftitutional defea ~ay ~e advantage.oufiy
.employed, port-v.:ine feems to bethe moll eligible. It
has the advantage of being grateful to the_palate and
ftomach,, and of hav1ng its ftimwant parts fp much di-
luted, that it can be conveniently given at all times and
Jeafons, and may be employed with fufficient caution ;
but it is of·little fervice unlefs taken prettylargely.--~
It may be fufp~ed that wine has an operation analo.
gous to that of opium ; and on good grounds. But
we candiftinaly mark its ftimulan~ power only; which
renders its e.ftetts in the phrenitic delirium manifeftly
hurtful ; but in cafes of debility as remarbbly ufeful.
~ -Hence I directed cite Solar Tinaure to be taken
.. morning, noon, and night, in ftrong.dofes, for the firft
month1 ; once a day, or oftener, at the difcrction of
the patient, until the end of the third month; but to
drink. every day after dinner, a pint of generous portJ

NocTuRNAL EMISSIONS, OR INcONTINEN<:E OF .
THE SEMEN.
A young man of rohuA: make, and in the prime of
life, being under twenty-fix years of age, applied to
·me for relief in the above unfortunate complaint. It
appeared, that, from the time of puberty, he had
found a weaknefs in the part, ·and an occafional dif•
charge of the feed, upon the flighteA: irritation. As
he grew ttp t'O greater maturity, the malady increafed
upon him. Upon every attempt to have conta8: with
afemale, the femen paff'ed involuntarily from him, be;;.
fore even a complete ered:ion cbuld take place, where:
by his purpofe was continually defeated. This defea
grew upon him, until the bare fight or thought of any
thing which tended to excite venereal deftres brought
away the feed; yet it had no affinity whatever to a
gleet, becaufe the emiffion never occurred but.either
in the attempt, or in the deftre, of copulation ; or un-
der the influence of lafcivious dreams. In proportion
u this weaknefs gfew upon him, his_defire of familia- ·

'rity with the fex became the ftronger; and, I am in~
. dined to think, was the principal reafon of the encreafe
of the malady, and of·the nocturnal emiffion_s, whlch
happened more.or lefs every time he went to fieep.
This inceff'ant difcharge had reduced him to a meagre
vifage, fallow complexion, hollow eyes, depreffion of ·
fpirits,.and flow....fever; and a galloping confumption
:would foon have followed. I direcced the Solar Tinc-
ture every mornirig at fun-rifing, .at mid-day, and at
1ix.o'clock in the afternoon, in the quantity of a wine-
glafs full, with one thirdwarm-water; andeverynight
at going to bed, twenty drops.of liquid laudanum, for
the pnrpofe of making his fieep too fl:rong to be af-
feCt:ed by the influence of dreams. · This courfe, affift-
ed by a ftrengthening regimen of calf's-foot jelly, -
veal-broth, and ftrong port-wine negus, had 'very
quickly the defired e.ffecc. His fieep w~ ·p~rfed:ly .
found and calm, and, after the third night, he could
not recolleCI: the return of any noccurnal emiffion.
The ftrengthening ointment, dir~d:en in page 240 of
my Family Phyftcian, was ufed every other .morning ;
and, within the fpace of only two months, the ·feminal
veffds were completely braced up, ·and the diforder fo

necefi"ary qUeftions, not a ftngle reply correfponded
with the -

l above fufpeeted, that he had fo much addieted him.; ·
felf'to this 1ha~eful and defl:rud:ive vice: that the fe.i
tninal velfels were completely relaxed ; the ered:oties,
the nerv~s, and glans, of the penis, had entirely fof!
their tone ; an involuntary difcharge of the femen;
without irritation, or tt.lrgidity of the parts, had long
t~ken place, and brought on a want of appetite; an
impoveri1hed fl:ate of the blood, and an univerfal lafli•
.tilde of the body. · The leeture I gave him upon this

four times a day, a table-fpoonful of the Solar Tinc-

3nd twice a day, in cold fpring-water, for the two

bilitated parts, gave elafticity to the blood, retrieved the

AN IMPURE OR TAINTED HABIT.
This malady, fo common among our diffipated
youth, generally.arifes from a venereal co~plaint b:u:ily
·~ured. Indeed the fcrophula, the king's evil, the le-
.profy, and other foul humours, when too long fuffer-
ed to prey upon the blood, will naturally induce this
confeq~ence i yet ninety-nine cafes ou~ of every hun-
dred, are found to refult from the improper ufe of
mercury, either taken too abundantly into the ftomach,
or too often applied externally, in·the venereal difeafe.
A gentleman in the militia very lately came to me un-
der this misfortune, who had abfolutely worn down the
organs of his ftomach by taking-medicines for its cure,
without obtaining the fmalleft relief. He was no
fooner warm in bed, than deep-feated noCl:urnal pains
attacked his arms, 1hins, and head, which many of the
faculty miftook for rheumatifm. The membranes,
mufcles, arid ligamf!nts ofthe joints, were.·fcar~ely ever
free

free from pain ;. whilA: ca,rious ulcers occafionally broke
out upon the ulna, tibia, and bones of the cranium.
Thefe fymptoms had alfo deceived feveral . of the fa.:
culty, who, taking'his complaint to be a confirmed lues;
ftill added to the malady, by loading him with frelh
dofes of mercury. The truth is, that this diforder
was by .no means of a venereal nature, but was rather
the confequence of the remedy than of the difeafe;
fince it arofe entirely from the long and repeated dofes
of mercury his body had fuftained, and which was
grounded in his habit by falivation. The mercury had
inftnuated itfelf into the marrow of his bones, had vi-
tiated every fluid fecretion, and tainted the very air h~
breathed. Under fuch circumftances I will allow, it is
very difficult, if not almoA: impoffible, for a phyftcian,
upon a fuperficial infpetl:ion, abfolutely to decide, whe-
ther the original difeaf~ hath been altogether overcome ;
yet furely he ought attentively to diftinguifh and con-
fider the feveral fymptoms apart; and then, · by com-
paring them with each other, a clear judgment may be
formed upon the general review. Finding, by this
method, the real ftate of the patient's cafe, I ordered
him a nourifhing diet, gentle exercife, and an abfolute
denial of the fmallefl: intercourfe with woman. To
this he readily fubmitted, putting himfelf under a re-
gular courfe of the Solar Tincture, which he took three
times a day, in the quantity of a wine-glafs three parts
full, filled ttp with warm water, for the firfl: month.
At the expiration of this time he paid me a vifit, when
his company was infinitely more agreeable, becaufe the

pleafing a(pect of he-1th had fup<:!rfecled the naufoo~$ .
~ffiuvia of his difeafe. I now only enjoined him to
follow the fame·regimen and abflemious mode of living
for a month or two longer, taking the Tind:ure diluted
in.aglafs of cold fpring-wat(:!r once or twice a day, ru?
h.e might tind himfelf indine<,i. This he rigidly at.,
tended to ; and l have now the ple~fure to declare) that
only nine large bottles of the Solar Tind:ure have
reftored this gentleman from the moft.dangerous and
¢ep1or~ble ftate .of fl. tainted and c9rrupted habit, to
found heaJth, and a.renovated ftate of the blood and

ATAlNTED HABIT IN A STATE OF PREGNANCY.
This is the moft ihocking cafe my ptad:ice or expe"."
rience ever produced. The patient was taken in }a.
bour, and in the ad: of parturjtion the child prefented
its right arm, which feparated from the body while the.
oper~tor was returni~g it into the womb. The life of
the mother being defpaired of, I was fent for; when,
on infpeCl:ion, I qui~kly perceived conception had taken
.Pl;t<:e under an infeCl:ed ftate of one of the parents. I
performed .the. reftdue of the opelCJ.tion ·myfelf, and
brought away the fcetus withoµt a farther feparation of
the jojnts, but with great difficulty, ftnce it was ulce-
rated and .half rotten with difeafe. By a moft tender
and judicious tre~tment of the .woman, affifted by the
Lunar Tincture, her ·life was_ preferved ; and in the
.fpace of ~ve weeks fhe appeared to have regained her

every one, fhe fell into a violent falivation, Being · ,
fent for upon this fingular occafion, I thought it right
to interrogate the hufuand; when, after a vaft deal of
hefitation and dilfembling, he confelfed having ha.cl
conned:ion with his wife under a venereal infed:ion;
and with a view to prevent the confequences, he hact
prevailed on her to fwallow ftrong dofes of mercury,
which I have reafon to fuppofe lay dormant in the body
until after her delivery; when the efforts of nature
being no longer. directed to the prefervation of the
child, fuffered the mercury to attack the falival glands,
and to produce the effeet we have juft defcribed. I
crdered her ~ fpare ~ut nouri1hing diet; worked q.ft
the mercury in the cufl:omary way1 and, then ~egan it
courfe of ~ Solar Tintture. A table-fpoonful, in l1ll
equal quantity of warm water~ ~as taken four times ~
day for the firft week ; then three times ~day until the
end of the ·month ; afterwards twice a day in cold

convenient; by this means 1he happily expei:ienced a

wine-glafs of cold fpring-water, during the whole nine
months ftate of pregnancy.
The above cafe brings to my recolleetion a very
fingular inftance of an accidental falivation, brought
upon a young lady by a foreign fubftance irritating one
of the parotid glands; the particulars of which I fuall
here infert for the fake of thofe who may happen to
be under ftmilar drcumftances.---ln the month of
April, 1751, a young lady about the age of fixteen
years, of a delicate habit, but fu bje8: to no particular
complaints, perceived the beginning of a difeafe which
afterwards proved .moft obftinate and loathfome, viz.-
'an incdfant fpitting. . The quantity of this difcharge
was.different at different times, varying from one pint
to two pints and a half in twenty-four hours., As to·
its quality, it feemed to be no other than the ordinary
fecretion of the falival glands. By fo large and con-
ftant an evacuation, her fuength became extremely
impaired, and the moft efficacious medicines had proved
ufelefs. She had taken large quantities of the P,eru-
vian bark, both alone and combined with preparations
of iron: and afterwards the fetid gums, opium, am-
ber, alum, and the Neville-Holt-water, had in fuc-
ceffion been given her. .In the mean time an exa8: re-
gimen had been prefcribed.: fue had been ordered to
ride conftantly; and to confine herfelf to a mucilagi-
. nous diet, fuch as veal, calves' feet, &c. Likewife a ·
gently-opening medicine had now and then been inter-
pofed. The difeafe ftill continued unaltered.; fue had
afterwards tried the tinfluraJaturnina ; and had, at the

fame time, b'een encouraged to chew the Peruvian.
bar~, and to fwallow the faliva. But all thefe attempts
had been vain ; and after 1he had taken fome or other
·of the medicines above mentioned until the end of
·September, 1753, namely, a.hove two years, it appeared
to her phyftcian, Sir George Baker, unreafonable to
exped relief in fuch a cafe from any internal medicines
whatever. He now conceived a fu(picion, that fome
extraneous body, having accidentally found its way
into the meatus auditoritts, might poffibly be the caufe
of this extraordinary fecretion, by keeping up a conti-
nued irritation in the parotid glands. With this view
he examined her ears, and extraded from them a quan-
tity of fotid wool. How, or when, it came thither,
·no account .could be given. To this fubilance he at-
tributed the beginning of the falivation, notwithftand-
~ng that the difeafe did not immediately abate on the
removal of the wool ; as it appeared to be no impro-
bable fuppofttion that the difcharge might be continued
by the force ,of habit, though the original caufe no
longer remained. It feemed therefore expedient to
introduce fome other habit, in the place of the increafed
fecretion of faliva ; which habit might :lften\'.ards be
gradually left off. With this intention, he prevailed
on the patient to chew perpetually a little dry bread,
and to fwallow it with her fpittle. In a few weeks, it
became necefrary for her to chew the bread only at cer-
tain hours in the day,; and thus, after two motiths, 1he
became entirely free from a moft difguftful and tedious
diforder.---It is worthy of o~fervation, that, at nrft,

the fwallowing of fo much faliva frequently occafioned
a naufea; and that then, for ·a few hours, fhe w~s
obliged to fpit it out as ufual ; and that, during the
greatefr part of the time when fhe ~hewed the bread,
file had a ff:ool or two every day more than common.
TABES DoRSALIS, OR CoNsuMPTION OF THE BACK.
A young gentleman, twenty-two years of age, ap· ·
plied to me in the above diforder, which had worn
him down to a mere fkeleton. The tabes is 'feldom
difringuifh~d by any remarkable fever, cough, or diffi.
tulty of breathi!lg; ·but is attended with want of ap-
petite, a weak digeflion, and a morbid {late of the
blood, whence the body grows languid, and wafles by
degrees. Someti~es this ·fpecies of confumption is
.brought on by a venereal ulcer ; but it moll common-
ly proceeds from exceffive evacuations of the femen,
which was the cafe with ~J:iis p;J.tient. He had too early
additl:ed himfelf to an intercourfe with l~wd women,
, which eventually brought on an involuntary fhedcling·
of the feed, which came from him on the leafl: deer-
tion, whether of walking, riding, lifting a weight, or
even of pulling off his clothes.---1 ordered him a
ftrong nutritious diet, with a tahle-fpoonful of the So-
lar Tincture four times a ·day, in the fame quantity of:
warm water, which .he pu~fued for a month. .He
found his ftrength was fo much recovered, that I could
fafely advife moderate exercife both on horfebaclc and
on foot. The gleet, however, was "Uncommonly ob-
ftinate • andthe T.i.neture was continued for the fecond

month in the fame quantity. By this time the parts
were confiderably braced; he could run orjumpwith- '
out perceiving the fmalleft emiffion; and the healthful
colour of.his cheek be~ to return.---He now per-
liftecj in the Tindure, only three times a dfl,y, for a
month longer ; after which the dofe was reduced to
night and morning for another month; he then took
it twice a day for two months more, at theend of which
period every fymptom of the complaint was removed,
he had fully recovered his B.eih.and ftrength, and now
preferves it ·by taking th~ Solar Tin&lre as a beve-
rage, made afte,r the manner of brandy and water.
This diforder has in general been deemed incurable~
:It is true, that; even in its early a~ks, it is fo eifcnti-
aJly neceffa:ry to abftain from venereal embraces, that
without it, the heft remedies willprove altogether ufe-
Jefa ; hence the TabesDorfalis fo often prov~·mortal,
becau(e the patient has fddom refolutionenough to dif-
penfe with his amours.
RHEUM,ATIC GouT.
This difeafe is generally brought on by alternate
heats and colds in the blood, whereby a humour is
produced which attacks the joints·and mufcles, fome-
times accompanied with clifcolourations and fwellings,
and at other times without either ; but it is always at•
tended with excruciatiRg pain. Mr. John Brandham,
of Bridlington <ll!ay, was attacked in this manner;.
when, after fome time, the fevere pain of.his joints,
falling into his legs and thighs, depi:ived him of the

u(e of his limbs, and confined him entirdy to his bed.
He was foon after (eized with a violent pain. in his head
and ftomach, which fo much affecfted his refpiration,
that inftant death-was expected. In this ex(mnity,
:half a wine·glafs of the Solar Tirtdure was adminif-
tered, ttndiluted, which removed the danger, and gave
his ftomach immediate eafe. A table.:fpoonful, in the
fame quantity. or warm water, was then given every
third hour, during the fucceeding day and night, by
which the pains were confiderably abated. He con-
tihued the medicine four times a day for a month
longer ; at the expiration of which time he experienced
a perfed cure, and has never fince found the fmalleft
return of.his coniplaint ; of which he is defirous of

B1TE OF A MAD Doo, oR. ANY VENOMous REPTm:s.
The fatal difeafe confequent on the bite of a mad
dog, is the.hydrophobia, or dread of waur; whichcir-
cumfbmce firil fugg~A:ed dipping in the fea for the
cure, by antipathy. It is very remarkable that thefe
patients have not only a dread of water, but of -every
thing bright·or tranfparent. Soon after this atfetl:ion
takes place, the mind becomes impaired ; which fuew~
that the poifon is carried through the blood to the ner-
vous fluid, a:nd thence tothe brain. Dr. Jam.es, in his
Treatifc on Canine Madnet5, mentions. a boy fent out
to fill two botcles with water, who was fo terrified by
_the_ noife of the liqqid running into them, that he fled
into the houfe crying out that he was bewitched. He
mentions alto the cafe of afarmer, who,:going to draw
fume ale rrom a catk, was terrified t-0 {uch a degree ~
its running into the velfel, that he ranout in great haftc
with the fpigot i~ his h~nd. But, in whatever manner
this fympt0m comes on, it is certain that the moft pain-
ful fenfat:ions acq>mpany every attempt to fwallow li-

quids. Nay, the bare fight o( water, of a looking·
glafs, or any thing clear or pellucid, will give the ut·
moft uneafinefs, and even throw the patient into con-
vulfions. In this difeafe there (eems to be an extreme ·
fenftbility and irritability of the J\ervous fyftem. The
eyes cannot bear the light, or the fight of any thing
· white; the 1eaft touch or motion oft"ends them, and
. .
they want to be kept as quiet and in as dark a place
as poffible. Some complain of the coldnefs of the
air, frequently when it is really warm. Others com.
plain of violent heat ; and have a great defire for cold
air, which yet never fails to increafe the fymptoms. In
all there is a great flow of the faliva intQ the mouth ~
which is exceedingly troublefome to the patients, as it
has the fame eff'ed: upon their fauces that other liquids
have. This therefore they perpetually blow off'.with
violence, which in a patient of Dr. Fothergill's occa-
fioned a noife not unlike the hollow barking of a dog,
and which he conjed:ures might have given rife to the
common notion that hydrophobious patients bark like
dog.s. They have an infatiable thirft; but are .unable
to get down any drink, except with the utmoft diffi-
culty; though fometimes they canfwallow bread foak-;
cd in liquids, ilices of oranges, or other fruits. There
:is a p~ under theftro/Jiculus cordis, as in the tetanus;
and the patients mournfully point to that place as the
feat of the difeafe. Dr. Vaughan is of.opinion that it
is this pain, rather than any difficulty in fwallowing.
which diftreff'es the patient on every attempt to drink.
The voice is commonly plaintive and mournful; but

Dr:Vaughan tells us there is a mixture of ficrcenefa
,and timidity in the countenance which he cannot ·de-
fcribe, but by which he could know a hydrophobious
perfon without afking any queftions. Some feem to
.have at times a furious delirium, and an inclination to
fpit at or bite th~ by-ftanders; while others fhew no
fuch inclination~ but will even fuffer people to wipe the
infide of their mouths with the corner of a handker- ·

Wolf, of Warfaw, to ljenry Baker, F. R. S. dated
Warfaw, September 26, 1767, we have the following
melancholy account· of the cafes of five perfons who
died of the hydrophobia :--~None of them quite loft
their fenfes; but they were all talking· without inter-
miffion, praying, lamenting, defpairing, curling, ftgh-

·belching, and retching, but rarely vomiting. Every
member is convulfed by fits, but moil: violently from
the .navel up to the breaft and refophagus. The fit
comes on every quarter of an hour; the fauces are not
.red, nor the tongue dry. The pulfe is not at all fever.;.

The face grows pale, then brown,.and durih.g the fit

becomes cold. They compofe themfelves quietly as if
to gct'ileep, and fo they expire. A general obferva-
tion was, that the lint and dreffings of the wounds,
even when dry, were always black, and that when the·
pus was very good in colour and appearance. In one
of Dr. Wolf's patients who recovered, the blood frank
·intolerably as it was drawn from a vein ; and one of
.Dr. Vaughan's patients complained of an intolerable
fa,tidfmell proceedin"g from the wounded part, though
mbody but.himfelf could perceive it. In general, the
Yiolent convulfions ceafe ·a fhort time before death ;
and even the hydrophobia goes off, fo that the patients
can drink freely. But this does not always happen ;
for Dr. Vaughan mentions the cafe of a patient, in
:'Whom, " when he had in appearance ceafed to breathe,
the fpafmus cynicus was obfervable, with an odd con-
.wlftve motion in the mufcles of the face ; and the
Arangc contrariety which took place in the adion of
thefo produced the moA: horrid affemblage of features
that can well be conceived. Of this patient alfo it .
was remarkable, that in the IaA: hours of his life he·
ce;Ued to call for drink, which had been his conftant
requeft ; ·but was perpctually afking for fomething to
cat."
The hydrophobia feems to be a fymptom peculiar
to the human race; for the mad animals which com-
municate the infcd:ion do not feem to have any di-ea4

, regard to the fymptoms of madnefs in dogs, they are
very equivocal ; and thofe particularly enumerated by
fome authors, are only fuch as might be exped:ed in
dogs much heated or agitated by being violently pur-
fued and ftruck. One fyrnptom indeed, if it couJd be
depended·upon, would determine the matter; namely,
that all other dogs avoid and run away from one that
is mad; and even large dogs will not attack one of the
fmalleft fize who is infe~ed with this difeafe. Upon
this fuppofition they point out a methodofdifcovering
whether a dog that hath been killed '!'38.really mad ot
not; namely, by rubbing a piece of meat along the
inn~~ of his mouth, and then offering it to a found
dog, If the latter eats it, it is a ftgn the dog was not
mad ; hut, if the other rejeds it with a kind of howl-
ing :noife, it is certain that he was. Dr. James tells
us, that among <logs the difeafe is infea:iOQS by ftayiDg
in the fame place; and that after a kennel has becn
once infeded, the dogs put into it will be for a corm-
derable time afterwards in danger of going mad alfo.

can operate through the cuticula; but, when that is
rubbed off, the fmalleft quantity is fufficient to commu-
nicate the difeafe, and a flight fcratch with the teeth of
a mad animal"has been found as pernicious as a large
woilnd. It is certain alfo, that the it;ifect:ion has been
communicated by the bites of dogs, ~ats, wolves, foxes,
weafels, fwine, and even cocks and hens, when in a ftate
of madnefs. But it does nQt appear that the diftem-
per is communicable from one hydrophobious perfon
to another, by means of the bite, or any other way.
• It has been generally allowed by praetitioners, that,
though.the hydrophobia may be prevented, yet it· can·
feldom be cured after it has made its appearance. The
moft effential part of the treatment therefore depends
on an immediate ufe of the proper means of preven-
tion. For this purpofe fome advife the inftant cutting
out the part bitten, which muft certainly be an effeCl:ual
mode, provided we could be fore the poifon had not

travelling in the ftage to Boxley-abbey, near Maidftone,
in Kent, a gentleman, who fat next me, putting his
head out of the window, received a violent cut acrofs
the eye with the coachman's whip, which produced an
immediate fwelling and'inflammation, attended with fo
much agony, that he declared the pain was infupporta-
ble. I had purchafed a bottle of your Solar Tincture
while in town, knowing it had performed many fur-
prifing cures in my neighbourhood. This I immedi-
ately opened, and applied to the infl~ed Part:; and1
after wafuing the eye wdl with it, I bound a white
handkerchief tight over it,·wetted with the T ind:ure.

OF THE PRINCIPLES OF LIFE AND DEATH.
Above all, the efficacy of the Solar Tina:ure is moll:
ftrik.ingly manifefted, by its A:imulating and re-anima..
ting powers, in cafes of accidental or fudden death.
Life denotes the animated A:ate of nature; and in bu..
man beings, exifts as long as an union of the foul and
body lafts. W.ith us, therefore, life continues, until
fuch feparation has really taken place; which can no
more be faid·to have happened during the paroxifm of
a fit, or of a blow which for a time deprives us of.
fenfation, or in the early period of an unnatural or fu.d·.,
den death, than·during ~e time we are afleep• . .It is
the want of proper fkill at fuch times that too often
·occafions Cleath to take place, when life abfolutely ex-
ifts in the blood, arid might with litde care have been
preferved. Death is therefore the aa of feparation <)f
the foul from the body ; in which feqfo it ft~ds op-
pofed to life, which confifts in the union thereof. An
a.nimal body> by the aaions· infeparable from life, .U.tr-
dergoes a continual change, and receives its dilfqlu~i~
by degrees~ Its fmalleft fibres become rigid ; it~ mi-·
·· nuter velfels grow into folid fibres no longer perviou~
to the fluids ; its greater velfels grow hard and n~-
.row; and every thing becomes contraa:ed, clofed, and "·
bound up: 'Y.h~nce the drynefs, immobility, and· ex-

olices of the·minuter ve&ls are de4lroyed ; the ·hu..
~rs A:agnate, harden, and at length coalefce with the
folids. • .Thus are the fubtileft fluids in the body in-
tercepted and loft, the concO\.'l:ion weakened, and the
reparation prevented ; only the bfpod c~ntinues to run
fiowly through the greater vefi"els, affiduous to preferve .
Jife, even after die animal fuRctions are delhoyed. At
length, in the procefs o( thefe changes, death becomes
iMvitable, as the neceffary confequence of life. But
lt is rare indeed that life is thus long protrad:ed, or .
that dea~ fucceeds merely from th~ natural decays
and impairment of old age. Accidental difeafes, and
·f>W' neglea of preferving health, cut the work 1hort.
The figns of death are oftenvery uncertain. If we
con{ult what Winflow or Bruchier have faid on this
&bjed:, we ihall be convinced, that between life and
death the ihade is fo very undiftinguiihabJe, that even
all the powers of art can fcarcely determine where the
ent ends and the other begins. The colour of ·the vi-
fage, the warmth of the body, and fupplenefs of th&
joints, are but uncertain figns of life ftill fubfifting, .
while, on the contrary, the palenefs of the complexion,
me coldnefs of the body, the ftiff'nefs .of the extrcmi-
ms,the ceff'ation·or all motion,.and the total infenfibi-
Jity o( tlteparts, are but uncertain marks of death be-
gun~ Jnthe fame manner alfo~ with regud to the pulfe
and breathing ; thefe motions are fo often kept under•
that it ia impoffible to perceive them. By bringing 11 .

ment : the glafs is frequently fullied by the t'apomt of
the dead man's body; and often.the perfon is am a.Jive,
though the glafs is no way tamifhed. In the flme
marmtr,. neither m>ifes in the ears, nor plttngent fpirlts
applied to the nofttils, give certain frgns of the dif·
continuance of life; and there are many inO:ances of
perfons who have endured them all, and afterwards
recovered without any external affiftance,, to the atto-
nifhment of the fpecbtors. This furely ought te> be

· dreds of valuable members of fociety are annually torri
from their difconfoiate families by fomtt accidental fud-:-
d~caufe,andhurriedthoughtlefslytothegrave,inwhom
the principles of life were capable of being revived !
This lamentable truth has been.eil:ablifhed by the hap-
py fuccefs of the Humane Societn fre>m whofe laudable
exertions feveral hundred perfons have been teitored
to life, who, to all vifible appearance, were pa.ft recO'Ve-
ry. Every age and country afforrls fome infhnces of
perfons having been recovered, even after lying long
for dead ; and from the number of tho(e preferved by
mere lucky accidents, it is evxdent that ftill greater
numbers might be favCd by timely ·pains and ~ill.

•The !hockingnfe ofMr. Groundwater, who was molt inhumanly
murdered on the :a3d of May Ian, by the convicts in Cumberland
Fort, nc:ar Portfmouth, manifefis the truth of this remark. The
above unfortunate perfon was deputed to overlook the convicts in
their working .hours; when having occalion to reprimand two of
them for miibehaviour, namely, Francis Jennifon, and William
Butterworth, who were under fentence of tranfportation for life,
they fell upon the unhappy Jllan with the iron lhovels with ·which
they were at work; and, having thrown him down, they ftruck the
lharp edge of the !hovels feveral times into his head, whereby the
cranium was penetrated, and fo large a filfurc made, that part of
the brains hung upoq the fpade, and the refidue fell out upon the
ground, in the quantity cf a double handful. They then· ftruc~
ilown one of the lhovels on his neck, with an evident delign to fever
the head from the body ; but, llriking againfi the bone, it bad not
the intended effect. Now it is a moft extraordinary circumfiance,
attefted by feveral witneffes on the trial of thefe inhuman wretch~·s,
who were convicted of the murder at the enfuing Winchefier affi-
zes, and executed on the 4th of Auguft, 1794, that Mr. Ground-
water lived eighteen hours after he had received the above gr.ievous
wounds, and after the whole of the brain had fallen out of the ca-
vity of the fcull. He was entirely fpeechlefs ; but the aCtion of
the pulfe was remarkably ftrong, and refpiration vifibly continued,
during the whole of the eighteen hours above-mentioned, This
~as pofitively attefted. on the oath of Mr. Hill, the furgeon w~o
attended him, and taken down as a mofi fingular cafe, by.Sir Nalh
G~ofe, who tried the prifoners. This fact therefore clearly decides

life is in the heart, or in the brain? for it evidently lhews that th~

For this reafon, whenever any accident has happened.
by which fudden death appears to have taken place,
whether by blows, fits, falls, fuffocation, ftrangulation;
drowning, apoplexy, convulfion-fits, thunder and light-
ning, affaffination, duelling, or the like, let the unfor..
tunate perfon be carried into a warm houfe,· and laid
by the fire, or put into a warm bed ; let two or three
table-fpoonfuls of the Solar Tineture be introduced as
early as poffible into the ftomach, and rubbed prO:.
fufely in by a warm hand, upon the fpine of the back,
loins, breaft, ~nd . region of rile heart, and poured jnto
the wound, if there be any; the warm ftimulating
quality of the medicine, affifted by the external heat
and frietion, will quickly roufe the ftagnant blOod and

ed by the valves, it will fwell fo as to fill the flaccid

.ing thus filled and ftimulated into contra&ion, fills the

wife contraCl:s and empties itfelf into the pulmonary

begins again where it left off; and the lungs, being

jeeted are produced by ourfelves.
Notwithftanding this unaccountable abufe of our
health, yet the wan~ ofit unfits us for mofl: of the com-

renders the unhappy fufferer peeviih and fullen, dif-
gufted at the allotments of Providence, and apt to in-
dl1ce fuicide, by f~ggefting gloomy and fufpicious fen- .
·timents of the Almighty. It obfl:ru&s the free exer-

to encounter the various ills and difappointments of
' this world with more courage, or'to fuftain them with
more patience ; and, in fhort, conduces much~ if we
are otherwife duly qualified, to our acting our·part in
every exigency of life with more firmnefs, confiftency;
and dignity. Therefore it imports us much to pre-
ferve and improve the habit of its.e~joyment, withou~
which every other external entertainment is taftelefs,
and moll other advantages are of little .avail. To this
end, we ought above all things to cultivate prudence,
temperance, fobriety, fortitude,. and equanimity of
temper j for without aprudent care of the body, and
a fteady government of the mind, to guard the one
from difeafe, and the other from the feuds of paffion
and prejudice, found health is unattainable. By tem-
perance we enjoy the real gr~tifications of life, with-
out fuffering any confequent inconvenience. Sobriety
enables us to be content with fimple and frugal fare,
and protects us from the pain and difgrace of intoxica-
tion. Fortitude enables us to bear thofe infirmities
which prudence and fobriety cannot fhun, and baniilies
all dread of imaginary evils from ~ur thoughts. Equa..
nimity of temper contributes greatly to the happinefs
of life, as well as to the prefervation of health, by
preferving the mind from anxiety and perturbation,
and arming us againft the calumnies and animofities of
human nature. Violent paffions, and the exceffes they
induce, gradually impair and wear away the conftitu-
tion; whilft the calm' and placid ftate of a temperate
mind, and the healthful exercifes of the body, preferve
