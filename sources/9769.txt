At that point, I was in a stage of total darkness and I felt wonderful, no pain, and no fear. Then I realized where I was at and I saw a bright light. My doctor was in the light and he told me I was not going to die. I went with him into the light and things started moving faster and faster. I came to a few hours later in intensive care. It took almost a full day to understand everything. I had to learn to walk all over, like if you had a stroke. I no longer fear death; I need to understand more. I am seeing a psychologist. I don't know if it is helping me understand.
