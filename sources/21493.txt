EXPLANATION
This book is the direct result of communication be
tween the physical world and the spirit world. Most of
the teaching has not been altered, but is given as it was
communicated to the author.
The Unfoldment Lessons are the result of experiments
by the author in development of the psychic senses, but
are all given here under the direction of astral teachers.
Much has been withheld, but there is still sufficient to
interest a student of psychic phenomena and nature.
All people are mediums at birth and all may unfold
their psychic senses by following these lessons faithfully.
The study of the Philosophy and Nature is very necessary
and should not be slighted.
Concentration on this work must mean progress to
you. Follow the book from the beginning to the end.
Study all the subjects as they are arranged and you must
unfold.
Yours very truly,
William Gordon.

Unfoldment I
IN
the beginning we will assume that you know ab
solutely nothing about the subject you have inter
ested yourself in. In this way we may conduct our
system of teaching more perfectly, and we believe, get
better results in the beginning.
We want you to forget that there is any argument
about there being a future life. We have proved that
there is satisfactorily to ourselves and, as you carry on
your studies, you also will receive sufficient proof that
there is a future life and that the peopte' who are now
living in that life are very real. They also are identic
ally the same kind of people as you yourself ate And •'.
consequently act just as they did before they passed over
to the other side of life.
Your first task is to realize that real men and women
are trying to speak to you from the other state of life,
or from the astral life, as we call it.
It is necessary to explain something of your chosen
subject—The Medium. A Medium is a person who is
capable of communication with those who have passed
over to the next state of existence. Application to your
studies will convince you of the fact that "There is no
Death."
In communicating with the Spirit World, we find
that there are two kinds of Spirits—Finite and Infinite.
The Finite Spirits are not always evil, but they are
always undesirable to contact because of the fact that
they are of low mentality and usually very ignorant.
Therefore, they cannot give any real intelligent knowl
edge of their life or conditions under which they live.
They also will inflict their low mental attitude upon
you so that you will find yourself thinking along the
lower lines of thought. This will never assist you to
progress as you cannot learn anything from someone
who knows less than yourself.

8 PSYCHIC UNFOLDMENT
The Infinite Spirit is of another type. He is of a
higher mentality and has greater intelligent knowledge
of the world he lives in. He has progressed in the Spirit
World and is more capable of helping you to progress.
The comparisons on earth life of the Finite and In
finite types would be the scientist Einstein, Shakespeare,
Sir Oliver Lodge, Thomas Edison; these men would be
classed as Infinite. The Criminals, Murderers, Idiots,
Sexual Perverts, Thieves or Low Thinkers, etc., would
be classed as Finite. So that the Infinite Spirits are the
most desirable to contact and they bring happiness and
progression, while the Finite Spirits always bring con
fusion, which is always undesirable, if not evil. There
fore, always desire to contact Infinite Controls.

Unfoldment II
IT
is our intention to change your whole attitude to
ward life in general. This must be done if you are
to succeed in your life's work as well as in your
studies. We must make you a positive, definite individ
ual, if you are not already, and if you are, we must
make you more so. Therefore, the test paper with the
square is given you to accomplish a task.
We intend to set tasks for you from time to time that
will teach you to concentrate and make you determined.
This must be done so that you may become a positive
and be able to determine by strength of will those
whom you will have for your contacts, both on the
earth and on the astral.
FORCE CONTACTS
By force contacts we mean that there are Spirits who
are capable of using force to manifest their presence.
The methods by which they do this in our class work
are through the automatic pencil, automatic painting
and automatic drawing.
AUTOMATIC WRITING
The first thing to be done is to procure a full length
pencil of medium softness. The student should sit at a
table, comfortably and relaxed. The pencil should be
held in an ordinary position of writing. The atten
tion should be on the point of the pencil. For a few
minutes there will possibly be no movement of the
pencil but persistent trial will eventually prove success
ful. (We must particularly draw your attention to
this part of the instruction.)
Persistance is sometimes necessary to get results.
When once the pencil has moved a little, you have be

gun your development and you will get rapid progres
sion. The first movements of the pencil will trace very
irregular lines, but no matter how irregular the lines
may be, you have had success. Force has been demon
strated to you by a force contact.
Continue this experiment at least half on hour be
fore resting. Should you have no success in the first at
tempt, after half an hour period of trial, study the Phil
osophy of Life. It will help you to learn, while your
forces gather strength to continue the writing. You
will notice that your hand seems sometimes to go in
one direction easier than in another. Try to assist a
little but do not write of your own accord.
The next phase of this experiment is that of watch
ing the pencil form letters. Attempts will be made to
form letters, and if you will assist, you will make more
progress. After the pencil has succeeded in forming let
ters, it will join them together and you will have a
long continuous string of letters. This is the control's
way of getting control of your hand.

hands above the head. Hold breath for a time.
Repeat these exercises for five minutes.
Exercise II.
Sit on floor. Raise hands above head. Draw back
torso until it touches floor, holding legs stiff and
straight. Repeat three times then bend forward touch
ing tips of the toes, then lay back with one sweeping
movement. Raise self from floor to sitting position then
bend forward until the toes are reached. Repeat twice.
Rest awhile.
Exercise III.
Lie on floor, cross limbs. Hold hands on head, palms
down. Send concentration straight ahead to spot on
wall for a period of two minutes. Fix eyes on spot,
but do not concentrate.

Exercise V:
Place two hands thumbs to the floor, palms around
small of back. Feet one foot apart. Chin lifted high.
Hold position one-half minute.
Continue these exercises once a day; twice a day is
better.
The first series of exercises induce good breathing,
will increase throat diction and help to vibrate the spine
to a better advantage, brings vitality to the stomach
and cleans the intestines. This is vitally necessary in
psychic development. Direction is also developed by
the concentration on the spot ahead.
Increase of time period in holding the third position
builds mentality, rapidly increases magnetic vibration
towards them and repels undesirable beings from them.
Students will sleep, eat and have clearer vision.

PSYCHIC UNFOLDMENT 13
Unfoldment III
TV 7HILE you were working on Lesson 2, you prob-
\^ ably noticed that while you were writing some
times, words came into your brain and you
knew what you were going to write before you wrote
it.
Notice: The thought came before the ACTION.
But when you thought that you were doing the
writing, another word was written by your hand al
together different from the word which was formed in
your brain.
This should have convinced you that an intelligence
other than your own was writing your messages.
Now continue your experiments by asking a ques
tion of the control who is writing and continue to ask
questions. You will receive the answers, in writing at
first, but later as you grow more proficient, your answers
will form in your thought first. When this occurs, it
will not be necessary to write. As you have progressed
to the Thought Contact stage of development.
THOUGHT CONTACT— continued by—CON
CENTRATION.
There are two kinds of thoughts. First, the Def
inite and second, the Indefinite.
To become a positive person, you must think def
initely.
To form the habit of thinking definitely, we train
the mind by concentration. Place an object on the
table about two feet in front of you. Rest the elbows
on the table, fix the eyes on the card or object and as
sert your will to keep your eyes on the spot for three
minutes. Then rest three minutes. This will result in
you asserting your Mastery over the Finite controls who
will endeavor to take your attention off the subject.
They will attempt to disgust you with your experi
ments, to tell you you are foolish to continue, etc., but

each determined effort you make to succeed will be a
result for good which strengthens you and makes you
more definite.
This will result in making you a definite positive per
son who knows what he wants to do and does it.
Continue to experiment with the time periods on
the object as often as possible until you succeed in ful
filling the time periods correctly.
An experiment in Concentration: Place the object
before you as formerly. Fix the eyes on it and notice
the thoughts that come to the brain.
Have a pencil and paper near you and write the one
word thoughts only, such as: black, yellow, rose, dog,
Anna, Helen. Never write a sentence or more than one
word. With this experiment be definite. Tell your
forces you will only write one word at a time.
Following are things to observe:
1. For certain periods there will be no thought, then
there will come a thought.
2. This teaches you that thought is not always pres
ent.
3. That thought comes and goes.
4. By this time, if you observe carefully, you will
have distinctly felt the thought come to your brain
as an electric contact or as an object striking the
brain.
5. This is evidence that thoughts are objects which
come from somewhere.
While you were writing automatically, you received
the thought, before the pencil wrote. Sometimes when
you get a thought to ask a question of the control, you
will receive the answer before you have finished asking
the question. This shows that your thought was known
before you received it.
Then if your thoughts are known before you receive
them, and if action is the direct result of thought, then
you are not the master of your action, but a tool for
another intelligence.
This is fact and the Human Race suffers because of
this lack of knowledge.

Unfoldment IV
WHILE
you were concentrating on the object, the
thought which came to you should have been
recognized by this time as voices. If when you
received a thought word, you were to answer it, you
would receive an answer. This is the method by which
vou will receive some of your messages and it is called,
"Clair-audience". Always be alone as much as pos
sible while conducting these experiments. While you
hold communication by Telepathy, which is by thought,
you will develop Clairaudience along with it. On cer
tain occasions you will hear a song running through
your head very persistently. This happens for fifteen
minutes or more before you realize it is happening. As
a matter of fact a greater part of this instruction is to
make you realize the happenings around you; that you
had not been noticing.
CLAIRAUDIENCE —Again you may hear musical
instruments at any time.
The so-called "Hunches", are example Clairaudience.
When you talk back to your thoughts or voices, this
is telepathy.
FIXATION —This is a method by which you ar
rive at any event. Fix your attention on a subject and
force your mind to stay on it. This will help you to
master concentration.
CONCENTRATION EXPERIMENT — Fix your
mind on a friend in the next room or building or at
their home. Tell them to come to you. When you want
your friend to do something or to bring something to
vou or to say some particular thing, do not ask them
audibly, concentrate on them. Tell them by thought.
Keep your mouth shut when you sit at the table;
ask by thought; experiment on children; order the dog
from the room. That is all concentration, fixation and

thought control. Remember if your concentration is
great enough or endures for a lengthy period, you will
eventually accomplish everything you concentrate up
on. But also, remember that if your interest is not a
good one, your concentration will be delayed by an in
finite control.
Love your enemies. They help to build you up.
Pay close attention to your thought voices; listen to
them carefully.

Unfoldment V
AUTOMATIC PAINTING
' I 'HIS phase of your development will give you much
J[ pleasure, and eventually you are going to get some
very nice pictures, which will surprise you.
It is not necessary that you know anything of draw
ing or painting, and even if you do, we prefer that you
do not assert your mind over the controls and begin
to paint your own pictures. Let the controls do the
work. Allow your hand to go where it wants to.
INSTRUCTIONS: Sit down with the drawing pad in
the left hand, resting on the knees.
Tell the control, whom you should look upon by
this time as a friend, to paint a flower first; then do as
he wants to do, as in Automatic Writing. In fact,
some people do not begin with Automatic Writing, but
with painting instead. Keep working on the picture
until the controls quit. If your picture shows up as
amateurish, ask the Logos to give you an artist. Asking
the Logos for anything is proper.
As you ask, so shall you receive. Never abuse a Con
trol Spirit. If they are undesirable, tell them to go
away, firmly, but never angrily.
Painting lessons should not exceed two hours, but
should be tried twice each week or oftener, for one
month or more. We find that to begin, it is better to
draw a square about eight inches and ask your artist
control to work within it. The next experiment: draw
a circle and ask your control to work within that. This
gives your forces a definite mind, and develops a Def
inite mind of your own.
REMEMBER— BE DEFINITE—BECOME
POSITIVE
Note: If you ever have trouble starting the painting,
read your Philosophy. It will bring a good control to
you to help you.

AUTOMATIC PAINTING
Continued
CARE
should be taken at all times not to waste en
ergy when painting a picture. This should be close
ly watched as you will waste as much time as six
months on a picture and never get a result. Also as the
force waves used seem to have the same effect on the body
as the violet ray, it is not desirable to burn your tissue
without accomplishing a definite result. So that, if you
find that you are not getting a definite picture, dismiss
the control and ask your leading soul for a new work
er. I cannot stress the fact too much that you must be
firm with your workers always. Appreciate a good
worker and give him thanks, but firmly reject an un
satisfactory one.
Should one of your limbs begin to pain stop paint
ing for a day or so; if the side of your face burns, don't
stay at the work too long at a time. This burning is
caused by the force waves used to produce the painting.
Continue with your experiments, but always assist
your workers if possible. Do not worry as to whether
you are doing the picture or not. You will always get to
a stage where you will not know what else to do, then
the work will be done for you. The artists usually do
not talk while they are painting. Do as your control
tells you. You should be conversing with your con
trols by this time.

20 PSYCHIC UNFOLDMENT
UnfoldmentVII
CONTROL OF CONTROLS
HE rejection of undesirable controls and contacts
is one of the most important lessons to concen-
trate on. By undesirable controls or contacts, we
mean those who are either evil or indefinite. Both are
useless to you in your journey through life and work
a great deal of havoc in your every day affairs. They
may exist on the earth plane as well as on the astral,
and they behave the same whichever plane they are on,
they may be evil or not evil. They may only be indefin
ite, or ignorant, they may make silly suggestions to
you; tell you to do foolish things, or even place you in
situations that are undesirable or dangerous, so that
when you find yourself being drawn into wrong thought
or wrong action, immediately stop and tell them to
leave you and assert your will in the opposite direction
for good. Should this have no effect, ask the Logos to
help you. If this is not effective, desire their infancy,
this means that their desire to do wrong is taken away
from them.
This experiment is interesting to watch in an earth
person. Try it on someone who curses or begins an un
pleasant conversation. Ask the Logos to take their
thought from them and watch the result when this is
done. They cannot tempt you. Move away from earth
people who anger you or who slander their neighbors,
who blaspheme God and who are evilly inclined, they
always tear down.
Those who are worth while show it in their speech
and habits, always look high. Leave others to work out
their own salvation, that is their affair, yours is enough
for you. If they ask for help the Logos will hear and
send it. They have the same opportunity as yourself
to progress.
If you keep evil at a distance, you will progress much
faster because your teachers can come to you much easier.

PSYCHIC UNFOLDMENT 21
UnfoldmentVIII
THE NEW LIFE
NEWER life should have begun for you by this
time and you should be recognizing the positive as
sistance you are getting with your studies. A limit
however is placed on the knowledge you will be allowed
to learn for sometime to come. But the real method of
development is carried on all the time you are working
with your studies. Your psychic forces or senses are be
ing developed all the time, by the teachers on the astral
planes. They are as anxious as I am to unfold you and
even more so. Your work for the present will be to
closely observe your actions. Notice the voices which
speak to you when you go into the silent places to
listen to them talk.
Notice the way that your affairs are interfered with.
Some of these interferences will be unpleasant so that
it becomes necessary to get rid of these contacts. This
is done in several ways and it must be remembered that
these contacts are people and that they act as such, and
if they are indefinite or evil, they will attach them
selves to you if you are thinking along the same men
tal plane as themselves. Therefore, alter your thoughts
desiring other things. This usually rids you of them
allowing others the chance to register, as you are like
a one way party line. No two people can influence you
at the one time and you cannot think of two things at
once. To repel evil, think good. Never anger. Tell
them to leave and be firm when you tell them. Appeal
to the Logos if necessary. Let no thought of anger,
jealousy, hate or other evil thing enter you. Let no
thought dwell on unpleasant things. Make your motto
to hear, speak and see no evil and you will progress rap
idly and become happy. Practice doing one thing at a
time and carrying it to a result. There is no chance in
life, everything is the result of cause. Control your
thoughts and the actions will be in tune. The result
will be according to your sowing. Keep your own
counsel until your result is attained.

Unfoldment IX
NCE you have listened to the voices and are able
tions and wait for the answer. You will get
better results if you ask aloud., but be careful you are
alone when you do this. A neighbor and friend may
not understand you. The children on the astral plane
particularly delight to contact one who is beginning to
talk, and they will give you no rest for weeks. In your
many daily tasks, there will always be someone with
you ready to advise and talk to you. At this period
guard your thought because if you should think an un
desirable thought, you will immediately be punished.
An article may be knocked out of your hand or your
head may be bumped or something fall on you, there
fore, heed a warning; think right; remember to reject
the ignorant control, but never display anger.
At this time also your whole life will probably be
reviewed; your every thought in past situations will be
brought to your attention and you will be questioned
about your actions. This is a form of judgment, but
it is done to make you think. Be intelligent at all times.
Use your mind. If in doubt, call on the Logos for un
derstanding.
Write a dozen sheets of paper full of names of dif
ferent articles; fruit, mineral, men's names, girl's names,
towns, fish, animals, etc.
Cover them with stickers to hide the names, then
ask your control to tell you each name hidden.
This will help you to hear mentally.

IT in a comfortable chair; relax; rest the arms com
fortably; hold heels flat on the floor; turn the eyes
up to the top of the head; close the eye lids; watch
the different colors of clouds drift by, do not strain the
eyes. Do this from five minutes to a half an hour, ac
cording to your force until you can sit in a shaded room,
but not necessarily in a dark one. You will see clouds
roll by. After a while the color changes and the light
appears. For several days you will probably see heads
without bodies. Do not be afraid, they are pictures
shown you by a machine which is small and can only
show the head. Later a larger machine will be used
to show you landscape and full length people. Be happy
at all times. You will get better results. Remember
your first lessons, do not desire or allow unpleasant pic
tures to come to you or unpleasant people.

24 PSYCHIC UNFOLDMENT
Unfoldment XI
Lie on the right side.
When leaving the body to go to the astral, tell your
control your name and where you live. He must know
before you begin. This must not be attempted if one
is in a weak condition. Your forces should be asked
when you are sure you desire to visit the astral. Ask a
reliable soul whom you are positively sure would not
injure you to be with you and see that you come to
no harm. Be on the right side. Fix the attention on a
place of egress for your soul at the center of the breast
below the heart. Now concentrate the will on that par
ticular spot persistently until you feel the soul go out
of the body.
Note that the temples will throb, the back will stif
fen. The body will shake as in a chill. When you
feel you have left the body, walk step by step to the
door. See each action done as you would do it in the
physical body; walk out the door, close it behind you,
walk to a certain spot not too far away. Then turn
around and return to your body. Stand beside it and
enter it again through the chest. Listen to your control
all the while. The next time you try, go further and
visit some old city. Then return. Be definite. Know
where you want to go and tell your control.
Keep your automatic painting up, the artists love to
control you.
PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE - /
I am the only thing in the world that is.
The Logos are definite, infinite intelligences.
Each one is part of the whole, you and I are part of
the whole.
Fixation is a thing you must concentrate on, you
must fix you attention on a subject and force your at
tention to stay on it.

PSYCHIC UNFOLDMENT 25
Between one and two in the morning, the Logos
come. They come once in twenty-four hours, they nev
er come between.
Perfect reception must be, in order that they register
within you the message they come to give.
Logos are blocked whenever possible by many influ
ences, and extreme concentration is necessary to com
municate with them.
The Logos are responsible for all that you have and
are.
They teach and give everything as well as create
within you all desire.
Their influence is not always seemingly good, but
their intent is to teach you to progress.
Each Logos has his own particular field of knowl
edge, and imparts that knowledge alone.
No water on earth contains more water than the
ocean, and no place on earth contains more Logos than
your own mind or soul.
Fixation must be your goal in order that you pro
gress.
Determine everything by the measure you possess of
it.
Get your concentration to the point of possessing.
A part of God's universe is yours by divine right.
Make money by this means if you can; it is neces
sary for your happiness. .
Concentrate on it as a form of accomplishment done.
Tell the Logos you have made a result when you
have obtained possession of anything.
Finite intelligences are another thing. They are not
so pure as the infinite; their work consists of a lowed
or more elemental type.
Fix your attention on being saved from ignorance
and you become intelligent.

26 PSYCHIC UNFOLDMENT
The Logos is conscious of the fact that he can come
to you.
He concentrates on you to draw your attention, then
if you respond, he teaches you; this is part of his hap
piness.
Blind faith must not be adhered to. You suffer if
you have faith in a finite intelligence, for it will take
advantage of you and deny you things.
Make no new contacts before you have learned one
another first.
Understanding comes to those who want it.
Logos come from a strata which is superior to this;
it is more definite.
It is the concentration of mass personified; all things
radiate from it.
A finite intelligence comes through because he cannot
help it. He is reaching out for contact, and will help
himself to anything he can find, good or bad.
No contact is ever made without a finite finding out
and trying to absorb the message, because it will do
him as much good as it will do you, if you receive it,,
if he can get you to shut it out.
Don't shut out an intelligent message of any kind,
for wisdom is power personified.
Thought is concentration in a greater form than any
other form. Make no plans without thought.
An eventful thing to do is to direct your consciousness
to a definite point and confine it on a subject for a
space of time.
In a woman you respect either the finite or the in
finite. One is mental, the other, physical.
Do not then be finite, be infinite. To radiate through
the atmosphere as a God is to be infinite indeed.
The higher thought pervades the all beautiful.
Love is one of the higher infinite developments.

PSYCHIC UNFOLDMENT 27
Soul soaring thoughts develop love always, which
reacts to you in infinite blessing.
Love cannot penetrate an atmosphere of wrath.
Definite emanations come from a body which is vio
lently in love for a while. They are green and can be
seen by people who are capable of psychic development.
The mere mention or thought of the finite is enough
to affect the radiations around you.
The more sensitive you are the quicker you recog
nize the definite, finite, or infinite in creation.
Appreciation is another form of creation. It builds
up harmony, creates joy, which vibrations enoble, build,
and help all that absorb them.
Speak not despairingly of your kind for they are one
with you in the infinite. For it is logical that, if the
essence of thought affect you, it either helps or hinders
your development. You build or tear down by thought
or action, and as a radio wave whirls through space, so
do your thoughts affect all things for good or evil.
Let your right hand not know what your left hand
doeth, but concentrate on the object to be obtained.
The obtaining of money on earth is a necessary form
of concentration, not for the sake of the money, but for
the happiness it is possible to give by its control.
If a man had money and was using it to tear down,
it would be a good thing to separate him from it.
Do not ever tear down a body without consulting a
Logos. Weigh carefully the good to be obtained and
compare it with the evil.
You cannot concentrate to tear down very long with
out tearing yourself down. Then your concentration is
destroyed for a while.
Concentration for the help of a Logos is prayer.
Words are finite; thoughts are infinite.
Be infinite whenever possible; separate the mental
from the physical.

28 PSYCHIC UNFOLDMENT
Love is the counter action of hate.
Mildness is the counteraction of violence.
Hate is personified in extreme wrath.
Love your Logos as you would your God; he re
sponds to love quicker.
If you never love, you will never register. Contact
with your Logos.
Logos are non-sexual.
There is no sex in heaven.
A Logos is a bright light in heaven; he radiates love,
joy, and illuminates all souls he comes in contact with.
Have faith in your Logos. He will help you if you
have faith that he can, but he is quite capable of help
ing you against your will.
He is the personification of power and builds at a
terrific rate all things he desires.
Separate the chaff from the wheat; reject the dross
wherever possible.
Give love a chance to pervade your being. It helps,
rebounds and comes back in the form of love again.
There are those who would help you. Give fixation
a chance to bring them to you. They will break the
barriers and come to you.
A Logos is more than infinite, he is definite.
The pin point of concentration is the definite point
of creation.
The creation was a definite thing.
The Cosmos was the field, the stars the material in
volved, a pin point of concentration was formed, and
nebulae is the result.
From then on, all creation is done on the same prin
ciple.
Definiteness is necessary to create Masterminds.

Inventors must concentrate on their objects before
attaining results.
Cosmos cannot exist without definite logical concen
tration by Logos.
They have demonstrated their ability to destroy by
thought all opposition to their purpose. God gave them
their being; it cannot control their substance, which is
matter foreign to earth and is not of this solar system.
Think of the Logos as the giver of gifts; he is your
beneficiary. Only concentration will help build you to
his level.
Make no contacts on earth without consulting your
Logos.
Give love to her who wants love.
Before desiring woman, see her mental development.
Never condition her who comes to you mentally.
Have regard for fathers, they are loved ones in glory.
Have use for money, but no regard.
Have no new friends easily.
Leave old people to their thoughts; their thoughts
are sufficient for them.
Love is only a new force in earth. Love was not al
ways; it was created.
God gave love to men. Always give love a place in
your contacts.
Never give thought to your spirituality; it can come
through all.
Every time you make a contact, leave your body out
of it.
Have no habitant of a fast house in your place of

PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE - //
Never live near a house of money.
Give answers to questions easily, never answer diffi
cult. Short forms of expression are best.
Love your enemies. They build their own prisons.
Make no new thoughts in love. Compress all desires
into small spaces.
Never extend love to a stranger; he has no regard
for you.
Love is only a divine force to be given to equals.
Your money is always a thing to respect. Give
money to all. Give new men your regard, never your
love.
Never disclose your guide to your neighbor. He may
ask him for your loved ones.
Hell never held a man who loved.
Hell never came to a man before he created it for him
self. Thoughts are his hell.
Never have evil thoughts; leave them to float away;
they are useless in life.
Have no new thoughts without investigation. They
are useless; they must be proved.
Life is only a new thing; it has only existed years.
Years are man made.
Love is all. No force converges into love.
Men only produce love to attain degrees of perfec
tion. It is produced by emanations. They convolute
from the body in streams, and are a direct reaction of
the physical and mental organisms which in harmony
combine their respirations.
Love cannot produce disease; only hate produces dis
ease.
Sooner or later love cures all ills.

Enemies of love produce disease.
Newer forms of love produce harmony, but never

He who never canvasses his wares never sells them.
He who never washes his mouth is never clean.
Never regard your physical self; it fades.
Come to your God for your protection. Give love

Have many thoughts for men to equal; never give
them lower.
Come to Jesus in the name of God; not to God in
the name of Jesus. He is not before God.
Love Him for His thoughts.
Give trust to Him; give love to Him; give harmoni

He builds, He creates, He makes, He slays, He plays,
He stays near always.
In your sleep you go to the astral; in your death you
go to the astral; in your trance you go to the astral.
Never trance before eating.
Give the guide your name and address before tranc
ing. He must know who you are; he must know where
you live.
Men who know, say little.
Love always your enemies; they will build you up.
Men who destroy won't ask for money; they take
it. Give their money a chance to kill them; it will.
Comfort men before you kill them. Never disturb
men who murder their kin; they have their purg
atory. They regard all men as prey; they have small
brains; they have no body above earth.
Keep passion down; it causes death.
Money cannot build anything; it tears down.

Those who love their God progress. Those who love
their money lose heart when they lose their money.
Women always have mental bodies to help them.
Women are a distinct creation and are not men.
Men must not create against women, but with them.
Forced marriage is not holy; it is against the vibra

Law cannot support itself against God; He rules all

Never love your jailer; he is brutal, and cannot hope
for forgiveness in heaven. Love cannot restrain pris

Love holds all hearts in bondage.
Birth of love is the birth of God-made emanations
in man.
Sight of God would produce love if vibrations re

Capital punishment is not useful; it has no place
in God's Kingdom.
Jesus is beneath a Logos in power. His emanations
are of earth. His brow cannot be healed until he reacts
against earth people.
His love for pride is His downfall. Emanations from
earth respond to His prideful soul; it helps keep Him
in bondage.
Give ear to wise counsel.

Money is bestowed on those who deserve it. Always

Comb your hair straight, never wave it; it helps you

Newer men will have long hair.
Animals produce hateful vibrations, be superior.
Men must not produce animal passions.
Animal passions are regarded as a useless form of vi

God is your judge.
Men may produce money, but never judge its effects.
It cannot weigh the balance down one second of time
in any earth justice. It may produce a world of phe

Money is new; it is only man-made. Buy no new

makes its own friends.
Love is a new man, he comes from Venus; his. force
is nearly spent and he must leave soon. Years will elapse

Your friends cannot compose you in death. Your
soul produces money to bury itself.
Never close your friend's eyes in death.
Man is not made to mourn; he is made to produce

PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE - III
Love is always the best way.
No new friend will kill his old friend. A new friend
may kill his new friend, but no old friend can come
to his side in heaven.
Why call on Christ for help; give God your thoughts.
Christ cannot help you. You hold him back. Before
God you are his equal in heaven.
Let him progress; his desire is such. Never rejoice
in his name, it is wicked.
Have new crosses made. Have no figures on them.
Their symbol of suffering causes suffering on the astral
to the astral people.
Love is a tantalizer of souls. It condemns men to vig

Love your kind before they die. Men may pass, but
souls continue.
Give money to your wife for her keep; she loves your
money. Give her your love; she wants your money
also.
Have her mental body under subjection by love.

Give her respect. If she abuses your household, beat
her; never kill her.
Give her no new men to caress; never love her pros-
stitution; she is your wife before God. Make her behave
before God; she will behave before men. Always speak
well of her before men.
Caresses before men breed contempt. Always pro
tect her before men. Never love her before men; caresses
before men breed evil desires.
Govern her thoughts against your desires. Keep her
chaste before women; they prattle.
Give women men's toys to play with and men wom
en's toys to play with. The contact satisfies.
Love always vibrates against you, not to you. Wom
en who vibrate to you cannot mother your sons.
Love is reaction; not harmony. It is always away
from the heart.
Love is only one form of an emanation from God.
It proceeds to produce its kind again. Love creates its
kind before angels. Angels create love; also men use
love. Angels never use it; they create it. Love is chang
ing; it ever radiates through space.
Never close your eyes to your loved ones. They need
your responses to their vibrations. They want love to
be given them in return.
If you have faith in your God, you need no friends.
Enemies cannot produce the love vibrations. Your
soul cannot be a friend against your enemies' vibrations
of wrath.
Harmony is desirable at all times.
Love cannot fail to conquer all enemies; their force
expends itself against a wall of love and is absorbed
by it.
Angels cannot produce creative love against your de
sire for children. Your reaction would be against them.
They will create children when they desire.

PSYCHIC UNFOLDMENT 37
You are an expression in the universe. Only a new
soul can come to God.
No earth vibrations exude love. Love is foreign to
earth. Man cannot combat love; it is foreign to his
emanations. Love is a disease.
New diseases are coming to earth. They are terrible
to combat. Angels are producing them to annihilate
man.
Man is evil; he is against God; his angels are stupid.
Newer thoughts are broken vows.
Older thoughts are new ones tried well and proved.
Man has no place in the future of the soul.
Death claims only those that are useless. Useful peo
ple do not die early; they—useless people—give forth
no vibrations, therefore, are not kept alive.
Newer souls are tried to see if they vibrate rapidly
enough.
If they do, they are allowed to live; if not, they are
killed off again.
Have no regard for death; it is only a sleep. There
is no suffering in death.
Many die of disease. That is a form of suffering
caused by evil thought. Never have old friends; mix
with new.
Loved ones should be protected from new friends.
Contacts easily made are easily broken.
Come to. God for advice by concentration.
Broken hearts mend after death.
Caresses breed love in circles. . .
No new friends should be admitted to circles.
Form new circles for new friends.
Govern circles by their love tokens; guide their right
hands to their loved ones.
Be staunch for your rights, if you have no one to
fight for you.

38 PSYCHIC UNFOLDMENT
Let no man slander your wife; give him no quarter.
Let no fight go to the death. Have no man's blood on
your hands.
Let no man's wife come unto you.
Let no prostitute come unto you.
Have only one woman before Cod.
Money is of no avail after death.
God may judge you while yet you live, and repay
you for your thoughts in kind.
Ever be careful of new money; it contaminates you.
Have no new forces to work for you. Logos have
old forces.
Millions now live with God who never lived on
earth.
You did not have to come to earth, you chose to
come.
Loved ones cannot produce your salvation from
earth life until you react against it yourself.
Later you will learn your emanations and profit by
them.
Pro-create whenever possible a loved one.
Love your fears; they will vanish.
Broken hearts cannot come to God.
Angels welcome your fears; they help you.
Despair cannot radiate to heaven.
Blankness is desirable against evil thought.
Idiots are not blank, they are intelligent souls in de
fective bodies. They cannot function in diseased brains.
Energy is old force made vital.
New creations come daily to earth. New masters
create them. Your many faces are an example. New
types develop always in time.
Old types are always in demand as monuments of
work done.

PSYCHIC UNFOLDMENT 39
Reward is no thought; to carry duty is better.
Love is never a token of price paid.
No man may force a cousin for a wife or force her
for a tool.
Cousinship is a new word for sexual indulgence of
blood ties.
Old friends cannot bring new desires.
Old men cannot marry new wives and live.
New wives tell all earth their desires before they
marry.
New wives do not have new thoughts before mar
riage.
Old men are conscious men; their elbows are old,
but their vibrations are new.
No friends can equal a soulmate.
No soulmate is known on earth.
No man may see God and live.
No man may see a Logos.
No man may see a bondsman.
He who calls your soul a thing is accursed.
No friend could be your enemy around your soul.
Your soul would destroy him.
Leave old thoughts away from your new friends;
their emanations are only short ones.
Look well to your desires; let them coordinate with
your name.
Have old men for counsellors on earth.
Dogs may look well on earth, but they look glorious
in heaven.
New dogs are your loved ones coming to earth.
Old friends have always come to you through dogs.
Let men have your money, but never your dogs.
Have your friends look your dogs over before kill
ing them.

No man may kill a dog and live in peace; his soul
will have a tribulation to cover.
Visitant people are not earth people; their mission
is to conduct classes; to convey the knowledge of God's
laws to the governed.
Knives are murder weapons and are abhorred in
heaven.
Let no knife carving be done before God's altar.
Only those who make happy jokes are worth while.
No friend may remain a friend if they will attain

PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE - IV
Leave no stone unturned to bless mothers of men
who spread joy.
Love is a great field to flounder in.
Hearts are the great daisies in that field.
Love all enemies because of their mental depression.
Give thoughts of righteousness to the lustful.
Cooperate with God's laws; they are incorruptible,
and cannot blaspheme Him who made them.
Tears are no asset in a church.
Leave untouched those who bemean your creed.
Curse no men, but lift no finger to help them.
Give no assistance to unholy people. Their sins have
found them out.
Make no contacts after eating fish. They cannot
compose themselves before you.
Leave untouched onions or fruit until after seances.
No medium may compose fruit in their stomach and
be spiritual. Meat is the diet of psychic forces.
Magnetic vibrations come from eating mutton, also
healing force.

Curses are always at hand for those that use them;
but flowers condone good thoughts.
Poppies never condone evil thoughts. No poppy

Death suggests violets to your soul. Give brilliant
flowers the preference.
Love your emanations; leave no stone unturned to

Only those who love God can become a Logos.
All fruit is evil; it is the corruption of all vegetable.
All emanations of fruit are corrupt.
All souls shun fruit eaters.
Let spirits control your body if you will, but never

Flowers call everything new. Love is harmonized
in all flowers. The petals are hung with vibrations. The
stem supports their loved ones. All life is still in
death,
)
but flowers are not dead.
Cone shaped flowers are mysterious emanations of
the Gods above earth.
All flowers are souls who have passed God's laws to
their interests. Their interest is to be a flower and cre
ate flowers.
Their field is always a new vibration.
All vibrations are emanating from God to earth, but
some rebound. They cannot get away before they are
used up by somebody.
Love new friends if they bring flowers to your sight.
Never fling a flower to a friend. Carry it; it brings
love to him. Thrown, it is spiteful and revolts against
you.
All emanations are powerful and should be learned
as rapidly as possible.
Brute force is a new emanation. It calls love brutal
names. New vibrations produce it. Hell is full of it.
Keep horrible thoughts on a plane away from your
mind. Never contact with horrible things.
Keep horrible tormentuous souls at a distance by
flogging mentally. Their debauchery and misery is a
real condition. It may always be avoided by reading
the word of God.
Only those who develop clairvoyance may read God's
book.
Only those who know God's laws may be God's
people.
All people will progress, but some belong to God
already.
Psychic people have progressed to God.
No new people could read God's book; it is only
for old souls to read.

PSYCHIC UNFOLDMENT 43
Laws confound men, but God's laws never confound
men.
All souls rejoice together to contact the Logos of
God. Many Logos are not of God ; some are of men.
Men Logos are frightful and are called monkey con
trols.
Controls of monkeys are Logos, but of the animal
kingdom, but man made monkey emanations, so there
is only the connection that monkeys are of man sub
stance.
Emanations of man kill all animal emanations.
Left to the natural laws, man-made emanations would
also vanish. Where God rules, his emanations produce
vitality and recreate man, His influence is for the bene
fit of man.
Evil desires produce evil results. Left to themselves,
men produce evil things. All these things are checked
up on and the useless ones are destroyed.
All suffering on earth is the result of animal mag
netism.
All inventors are spiritual men whose magnetism
has vanished.
Let men wonder, they need to know more.
Emanation and vibrations are different. Vibrations
deflect from an object and create disturbance in the as
tral world. This reflection of force is called vibration.
According to the magnetic quality of the object struck
by the force and its ability to absorb or hold a portion
of that force to itself so the length of the vibration is
goverened. So it is that various vibrations that were
the same at the starting point, after arriving at a def
inite point in their journey, may appear to change into
different creations, temporarily, but eventually resume
their original shape and length. So in reality, all are
one and the same. In reality no two things are alike,
but all are related in vibration.
Hell cannot be heaven, yet eventually all will be one.

Some day music will be noise and noise will be mu
sic.
Life is an emanation of God's breath.
No life is governed by its length, but by its vibra
tion. If they respond to psychic forces easily, their
souls remain in them; if not, they die.
No soul wants a body that cannot be used.
Become a Logos and you have no death.
Never reveal your actions to a finite control. His
newer vibrations breed newer despair for him. Love
always his controller, he is teaching him to disgust him

All thoughts are objects; they are divine or other
wise.
Look well to your thoughts; they are your means
of identification.
Love is a symbol of devotion to mankind. Man is
a spirit of incarnate joy to God.
Look well over the things you do; they reflect your
character.
Many men reveal their thoughts to God. He always
answers them according to their measure of purity.
Let money vanish all evil thoughts and it reveals its
goodness.
All flowers vibrate rapidly when a human approaches.
They despair of their lives. They re-act against a hu
man.
Cattle will not stand still at a flower show; it is like
a morgue to them. They react against a dead flower.
Love cows. They are people who have gone astray
and must mourn their time out.
Leave cows to people that milk them. Do not talk
to them; it grieves them not to answer.
Love all manifestations of God; they beautify the

Trees are newer creations. They were not always;
old things are tree ferns. They were before trees.
Trees may produce flowers of many shades, but only
one type of soul will produce a tree of one kind.
Love all manifestations of God; they beautify the
earth.
Trees never appeared before man. All men remember
trees. No man remembers tree ferns.
Logos divulge no secret doctrine to man.
Bees are a Logos; they have materialized. When
bees gather around you, your thoughts are spiritual. No
one may hold them captive. Their soul will leave be

bee knows them.
He is a Logos of God's insect kingdom. Bees cannot

God's laws forbid insects to stay where evil emana

No man may meet an insect on equal terms and live.
Its emanations are more than a match for man.
Look well to your studies. They are all you require

No man may understand women; their souls are
different.
No heaven is complete; no man is complete; no wom
an is new. She is older than the trees; she is older than
ferns; no soul supports woman. She is dependent on
her vibrations alone. Let bygones be bygones where
women are concerned; they always respond to love.
Give men their rights before God. No man is secure
in God's Kingdom. His wife may take him away.
Love vour wives; they may produce new men, but
pray for them and they bless you in heaven.
The creative instinct is leaving men; woman wants
no babes of men.
Tell woman you are the master always, never tell
her she is mighty; she reacts to vanity.
Men cannot combat with women and live; their
souls would dwindle away.
Let no man corrupt a woman's soul; she would de
stroy his children.
Leave courts of honor to subdue men.
Men may subdue women by thoughts of love.
Love's emanations are leaving men; woman is ab
sorbing them.
Newer men will have no love for women.
The creative instinct is leaving men.
When women rebel against anything, men follow.
Keep harmony in your classes by loving each other.
No treachery is good.
All life is responsible to woman. All men vibrate

body superior to man's.
Friends of women vibrate rapidly. It is God's will.
Men without women are useless* They may not live.
Live always near a woman. She may love another man,
but not respond to his vibrations.
Lust is destructful; it destroys men. Women vibrate
under it rapidly. Rapid vibrations build women.
Men may destroy in a lustful mood, but lust is a
necessary form of vibration. When children must be
produced, lust is desirable; it is creative.
Never lust uselessly; use lust to create children. They
are blessed; they respond to love.
Leave women who may not have children. They
are useless. Give women the right to love men if you
will not leave them.
Time may destroy your face, but women see your
soul.
Give mothers your love vibrations; they deserve them.
Give sweethearts love; give them kisses. Never lust for
them before men. Marriage is desirable always; it helps
men to realize contact.
Love for women may comfort men's souls. Never
their body.
Lust covers man with glory. It emanates from his
soul, but destroys his progress.
Give men results in children; leave no stone unturn
ed to produce them.
Let no man affront your sex. Leave no soul to an
guish before God because of your sex.
Sex is useful, but only as a tool to build men.
Love men if you will, but father no man's children.

Love always new babies; they have no regatd for
man.
Finite intelligences are lower intelligences. Their
thoughts are degrading and ignorant.
An infinite intelligence is above the average man in
intelligence and goodness, but lower than a Logos. He
may intercept a heavenly thought sometimes, but will
always carry it to you.
A finite intelligence carries no emanations. He con
trols, he inflicts his pain on you, he reacts always evilly.
All intelligences carry men to their influences when
ever possible.
No woman may enter a man's room. No man may
enter a woman's room. She will hear him talk; she
will know his voice; she listens to his vibrations: she
tells his nostrils; she helps him found his home. No man
may enter her heart to see her many virtues.
She conceals all emotions from God.
No woman despairs of man; she despairs of God.
She is sensitive to ridicule and jealous of her emana
tions. No wasted emanations could found a heaven in a
woman's heart.
She disappoints man to subdue his spirit, but re
leases her wrath to entice him.
Look at women as God's but be careful not to touch
their vibrations; they destroy men always.
Never leave your mother's emanations until a Logos
comes for you. Leave gods to worry; never let men
worry you. Your brain will think easier.
Let men fight; never join them. Let them kill; nev
er sympathize with them. They do wrong, never sym
pathize with a wrong doer. He must be punished for
his sins.
Love all men that act like men. They must act
right; they give results when you appreciate them.

Never listen to men blaspheme God. Never be still

Laughter is the expression of happiness. No laugh

Love all emanation of sheep; they reflect strength.
Cattle may not be killed; they are people.
New people come to you in herds of cattle.
Sheep are animals but souls of men dwell in their

Look well to your knives; they may send you to

Never strike a man before he strikes you; his soul

Logos are indefinite creations compared with God.
God is the Infinite, Definite Logos of the Master.
The Master is the God indeed of people. No master di
rects his Logos to earth. Vibrations of earth do not

gos.
Evil earth emanations are killed by good emanations
of the Logos. Logos always teach the truth when they
come near a planet.
An emanation is a force wave. Emanations are of
different kinds. They are altered or polluted by con
tact with other emanations. Creations of objects re
sult because of mixed emanations. Before they came
there was nothing. No creation existed.

PSYCHIC DEVELOPMENT
MEDIUM, being an extremely sensitive person,
must be protected not only from earth contacts,
but from astral contacts. The only way that a
person can protect himself from astral forces is by liv
ing properly.
The mental attitude is one that has to be considered
very much. An extremely sensitive medium is also li
able to contact the condition of any person within a
radius of thirty feet. For this reason alone people who
are developing to become sensitives should be careful
of their earthly associations. People who are infected
in any way with a disease of a malignant such as throat
infection or bad breath should never be allowed to con
tact a person who is developing. Astral forces should
also bear this in mind when they attempt to contact
a medium because tissue is susceptible at all times to
the dominant being that is contacting a physical body.
The development of a psychic is a very great event
and should be very much appreciated on the earth plane.
One who has registered earthly desires and has branched
forth with a desire to contact infinite forces, should be
appreciated and a great deal should be done for them.
In developing the earth psychic, the house they live
in should be considered. A damp dwelling is never a
good place for them to reside in. Houses built on top
of the soil are better than those whose bottom goes
deep into the ground. The higher in the air the student
lives, the better progress he will make in development.
Students are extremely sensitive to changes or to sud
den differences of temperature. They should never be
come too hot or too cold, but should stay within a
moderate temperature at all times.
When the subject of communicating with astral
forces is being considered, all the attention that the stu

dent has should be directed towards the God Being with
a desire impressed in his mind that he direct to them
an intelligent control. The forces surrounding the
masters, who are directing the student, should also be
considered. His mentality should be above earthly de
sires, possessive qualities should never exist and a sin
cere regard for the benefit of the student should be quite
evident before any student places himself under his di
rection.
One of the first steps to be taken in trying to con
tact the astral is to try to understand the mentality of
the force that is attempting to direct the student's action.
The method communicated to your teacher is one of
writing, through which one may ascertain whether an
educated person or an imbecile or a natural ignoramus
is trying to direct the action of the student. Therefore,
it is always wise to wait until you have accomplished
several pages of dictation. When this is accomplished,
you have learned the breaking periods. You have
learned when one control leaves and another takes its
place. You have also had evidence that a master can
lose contact, that your thought can be stopped and that
there must be extreme concentration in order that you
get in touch again with your directing force.
People who are studying psychic phenomena should
never sit in dark places, but should always absorb as
much light as they possibly can. Beings of light sur
pass in power those who work in the dark and, while
evil does not exist, beings who work in the dark can
not accomplish very much, therefore, it is better to work
in the light at all times.
The nationality of your control is also one thing
that should be ascertained. It is always wiser to have
a control who is of the people you are living among
because he can direct your actions and has very much
more influence in directing other forces to attend you.
A teacher on the earth plane in a foreign country is no
more different than a foreign control working through
a man of another nationality. They have their pre
judices against the other nationality and can never

clearly understand the mind of the student and, con
sequently, at times will direct the student to actions
that are not in accordance with the desires of that stu
dent. Women should have women controls, men should
have men controls and these facts should be taken into
consideration and Logos or teachers should be asked to
accomplish these things.
Walks in the country assist a student to progress.
Deep breathing is beneficial; quantities of water should
be taken into the body and cleanliness is very necessary.
The mouth should be washed continually and the head
kept clear.
Neighbors should be kept at a distance and the fam
ily of the student should not be informed of his prog
ress or her progress. They should be kept at a distance
and the student should work silently, keeping his con
tacts to himself, working out his progression by him
self.
If a student desires to progress along definite lines;
music, poetry, artistic work, or scientific work, their at
tention should be directed to contacting people of that
type who reside on the astral. The names of your con
trols should be ascertained and their work should be
displayed before you for your inspection.
\Early hours are particularly necessary for a student
and there should not be any more physical contact with
the other sex than is necessary for the benefit otjheir
physical body.
Demonstrations of psychic force will occur from
time to time in the life of the student. After five weeks
of steady concentration on writing, another phase of
the work should be taken up. But five weeks of con
stant concentration on writing is necessary in order
that a medium become an accomplished psychic.

INDUCTION AND CORRESPONDENTS
ONE
of the most important things one must watch
in development is to keep an intelligent head at
all times. You must be master of yourself in
all your experiments. Keep a clear idea of what you
have been doing during the past few weeks. You have
gathered much valuable information about this work
that we have not told you, that is, if you have been
using your brain intelligently.
Now, we give you another experiment. Go walk
ing and while you are walking, ask your control to
show you a word on a sign or in some other way we
want you to get familiar with the way that your forces
warn you, teach you or tell you facts.
For Example: If a child were walking near you and
your forces wanted to acquaint you with some fact re
garding it. They may lift your eyes to a sign of some
kind, but your eyes will focus on only one word. Then
ask them to show you how they would have told you
the same thing in a different way if that sign had not
been there. You will be surprised at the different ways
that they have of conveying knowledge to you.
This is an interesting experiment and an enjoyable
one. It also helps you to appreciate the presences who
guard you and, furthermore, you should have realized
by this time that you are never alone at any time, so
that all your actions are known and watched. Rather
appalling, is it not, when one realizes it? But do not
allow it to worry you as it has always been so and
everyone else is in the same fix. However, you should
profit by this.
Induction periods begin in adults at about the twen
ty-third year and continue on until the thirty-fifth year
almost without a break. At this time their interest

will be entirely with earthly affairs. Many people pre
fer to stop all spiritual contact during this stage, but
if spiritual contact is continued at all it is always in a
very advanced stage.
Mental people can give no induction to their sur
rounding people between the ages of twenty-three and
thirty-five because at this time, should their interest be
of the infinite type, it will be so far advanced that they
will lose interest entirely with earthly people. Insane
people are a form of finite people. The induction that
they have produced has caused obsession of their men
tals by indefinite forces.
Mentals are affected a great deal by the forces around
them and vibrations playing upon a mental may force
it into a channel regardless as to whether it so desires
to be forced into that particular channel or not. Men
tals also may become diseased and produce hallucina
tions which will leave the brain in a fatigued condition.
This loss of energy is the cause of many stupid people.
Brains which cannot reproduce mind pictures are use
less as vehicles of thought. This takes the form to the
human understanding of a person who lacks imagina
tion. A mind picture is induced by an active mental
body. An inventor is a sample of an active mental
body with an active induction period. When induc
tion is not present, there could be no attraction for a
magnetic current. Hence, nothing good reaches within
the brain of the individual pertaining to astral fields.
Poets are also of an active mental type, but their in
ductive period will never stand the prolonged duration
of an inventor. Poets induce contact with mentals from
other stratas who have been delivered into channels of
creative conditions and they give forth brilliant forma
tions for the production of word pictures in the minds
of poets. Dreamers of words work also with rhythm.
His rhythmic waves are tuned by sound and rhythm pro
duces its own gratification. Lives of poets are never
completely out of the inductive period. Their ability
to induce cooperation at any period with an active men
tal from the twenty-third plane is recognized. Artists

also appear to have a prolonged inductive period, but
the inductive period of an engineer is not as long as
those who handle finer degrees of infinite matter. En
gineering is the finest degree of material matter involved,
but it is not of the infinite type, but of a definite, in
finite type. Material is involved in the construction of
engineering work. Citizens of an ordinary nature have
no induction. Their minds are resting. Their auto
matic bodies are never open to higher fields and all that
is necessary to prolong their life on the earth plane is
stimulation. This is induced by reaction upon their
physical chemical by masters.
Induction always comes to a higher mental. One
who has learned to control his mental can produce an
induction period almost at any time. It is the opening
of the mind to the conditions around him. The actual
development of which lies within his own power.
Minds contact mentals either by direct concentration
or by inducement from the mental. The mind cannot
convey a message to a mental if the mental is not
interested, there would be wasted energy, therefore,
minds wait for the induction period to be established
in an individual before attempting to contact the phys
ical.
Lives of earth's men are supreme and definite. While
on earth they are subject to very many conditions when
they do not even interest themselves in the physical
that is under their direction. They rest sometimes and
they convey knowledge whenever they so desire, but
they also are dependent upon other laws for their di
rection of concentration and if they are directed to con
centrate upon a human physical, they will do so. At
other times they will leave a human physical to the
direction of surrounding forces. These forces induce
the human physical to live a healthy condition of life.
They defray expenses of an earth physical. They give
it salts; they give it water, and they give it harmonious
conditions in which the physical is living and they an
alyze the situation and usually arrive at a definite course
of correction.

PSYCHIC UNFOLDMENT 59
The usefulness of a physical is the first thing to con
sider. Useless physicals are only allowed to vibrate for
about fifty years. After that time if they are found to
be useful, they will be given work of a lighter nature
or a more concentrated work according to the mental
which controls the physical. Useful physicals will have
huge supplies of energy supplied to them through which
energy they will produce magnificent creations and
when they are seen from other stratas they are very
beautiful. The lives of men reflect themselves in the
creations which they produce. Those things which are
useful which they have produced, remain behind to
reproduce their kind. The chain of circumstances sur
rounding the correspondent which have attached them
selves to these thoughts and to these creations which the
mind of a physical human has produced may have a
violent reaction at a future time and also may bring
forth an original chain of definite happenings which will
annoy him considerably at a later stage. The illustra
tion we produce for your consummation is one of a
man who produced a fly and in a week it produced ten
billion flies who felt that they had to attach themselves,
to the person of the creature who had produced them.
He had, therefore, produced for himself annoyances
which attached themselves to his body as their home,
so that you see that a correspondent is one thing which
must be taken very carefully into consideration in the
future. Audiences that abound around earth listening
to teachers are correspondents.
From the definite man springs a definite man. From
the Chinaman springs a Chinaman and from the Negro
springs a Negro. Definite persons produce their kind;
indefinite people also reproduce their kind. Therefore,
attach yourself only to those people who are definite if
you desire to have definite correspondents. Like breeds

does can be finished. Only those things that are def
initely belonging to any individual can reach ultimate
success.
The reactionary period of one mind working through
another's physical can never attain the finished product,
by this means you are able to distinguish obsessed
people. It is very simple; people who start something
and do not finish it; people who do not carry things
to a result, are not working with their own mind. If
you produce a result, there will immediately be repro
ductions which will have the same properties as the
original result. A succession of these results will be
correspondents. A sun will burst and fling into the ether
particles which in turn become stars and planets, they
in turn will be destroyed and correspondents will be
the result. All knowledge that is given to earth must
have its correspondents, therefore, consider those around
you as correspondents of some particular mind bring
ing you into the clear definite thought. God is the cen
ter of all things surrounding part of God, correspondents
of God, etc. Attach each individual to the center that
he belongs to and you have the definite point from
which to teach.
The influences which have distributed types of peo
ple into various nationalities throughout the earth are
gradually bringing them together. Formerly nations
were divided against each other. The various types in
each nation will come closer to each other and attach
themselves to a center which will have a definite teach
er who will be subject to the one great mind.
Place an article within people's reach that they desire.
Give no thought to what happens to the article. Cer
tainly protect yourself, but let your mental attitude be
that of trust —positive trust —in the person whom you
are experimenting with. Next, give to those whom you
consider worthy and whom you would care to contact
with. Induce people to give you mental progression by
asking questions that concern your affairs, but never
concern yourself with their affairs.

CLAIRVOYANCE
APERSON who is first attracted by psychic forces
and who is beginning to see small specks of light
is usually in a peculiar form of development. His
mental attitude at this time undergoes a change. He
will induce companions to leave, he will try to wander
away from his home, he will have music as a consola
tion and children will have his attention.
Devoted parents contemplating the develooment of
the psychic senses should be careful that they look well
to their household affairs before they give lessons. All
lessons should be conducted in the afternoon or eve
ning. All house work should be done in the vicinity
early in the morning. Disturbed vibrations are caused
by moving ob jects or by the displacing of articles in a
room lessons are to be given in. This should never be
attempted one hour before concentration. The mind
of an intelligent student will understand this. The
lights that begin to appear when a mental is beginning
to react to clairvoyant sierht is one subject which we
will concern ourselves with at this time.
The light that appears before the student, straight
ahead is usually a teacher. A light that comes lower
than it towards the floor will usually be a child. A
manifestation here includes children and adults. The
top of the head of a physical glows. It shows light.
The human physical on the astral will also produce a
light at the head. Hence, the difference in the altitude
of the two lights.
Women will always be smaller than men in the men
tal plane, consequently they usually come at a lower
altitude, usually higher than a child, but lower than a
man. A woman's light is green in appearance. The
white light indicates a large man; a yellow light is a

man of slender proportions. Blue lights are not good
lights. Inferior forces display lights also, but they have
color. White lights do not denote ignorant mentalities.
White lights are usually accomplished psychics and con
tact is made because of the clear vision they have. Earth's
psychics can distinguish the mentality of their forces by
the lights that show. Colored lights should never be
contacted unless they appear to be green. Blue lights
should be avoided.
Money should never be concentrated upon during
the period when classes are being held.
Mental development of students must be along the
lines of rest. No hard laborious work must be allowed
a student while they are developing their psychic forces.
For this reason we take them away from work.
Delight in men who have psychic perception. Fore
sight is one of the conditions that denote this. Mentals
above the average will shudder when evil or unpleasant
things are mentioned. Horrible stories should be shun
ned at all costs. Beings that will attract a murderer will
induce you to read fiction that is hideous. People who
cry aloud should be avoided.
Condition women only at their desire. It is not wrong
to condition them if they desire it.
Men may not prey upon their family. Beings who
control, display anger when they see humiliation being
inflicted upon the family of a student.
A student also must take counsel with his God once
every day.
Logos respond to thought at all times.
Visiting forces will display ignorance occasionally.
That is to be expected. Please understand that there
are ignorant people on the astral.
Try to interpret the message given you. If it is not
clear, ask for a further explanation. In this way you
denote superior mentality.
Give every thought a chance to pervade your being
and return thoughts that are unpleasant back again to
their senders.

DEVELOPMENT
when confined close is not a
Stood thing. Plenty of room is necessary. It is
also very necessary to be able to walk. When
one is vibrating mentally on a higher plane and reach
ing out for contact with infinite forces, lots of air is
required and any confined space does not usually allow
this.
Persons of nervous temperaments should have mas
sage before attempting to sit for development. The
stomach should always be massaged at least three hours
before sitting for development.
When concentration is desired, a Logos should be
informed that the student is about to begin concentra
tion. The elimination of fear is also very necessary. A
good deal of fear can be overcome by gathering flowers
and placing them within the student's chamber. While
higher deities tell of the destruction of flowers as being
against the higher vibration, still the mentals who as
sume the task of developing earth's psychics find that
the natural tendency of a physical body is to rest when
surrounded by vegetation due to the action of the vege
tation on their system. Therefore, we always develop
a student in the country if possible. Long journeys,
however, are not to be attempted or any journey that
is especially fatiguing. Only those who have passed
through the various stages of concentration can fully
understand why short journevs are necessary. A change
of scenery means a change of chemical and a change of
chemical is very necessary to one who is develooing.
For this reason also many times a student will change

cerning every day happenings.
Remarks about personal affairs should always be con
sidered private and never disclosed in classes. Remarks
about general class work on phenomena in general are
welcomed by your instructors.
But your intimate affairs only concern yourself and
should be kept to yourself.
At the stage of development when you are contact
ing your spiritual guides, they can give any desired in
formation without the necessity of your divulging your
business either to your teacher or to other class mem
bers.
Try to instill into your mind the desirability of con
tacting people who desire equally with yourself mas
ters. In fact it is necessary for you to fix your concen
tration on the thought form of the master. He, as a
teacher, will come more readily and give better results
to you. Throw discretion to the winds whenever you
come into class. Forget yourself entirely. Leave per
sonal elements out of things. Forget your own ideas;
think nothing of people's personal opinions. Let no
earthly ideas worry you, but fix your attention solely
on the master and his instructions.
The body of your fellow student does not concern
you. The contour of their form is none of your busi
ness. Any other personal effects which he or she may
have also do not concern you. Your concern should
be only with yourself. Realizing, however, that har
mony must exist, respect your fellow class mates and
give your best thought to all. Consummation of ideas
belonging to others is also not necessary. Their ideas
are their opinions. Opinions are not facts. Your guides
and your teachers will give you facts. Appeal to the
Logos only when you find yourself in difficulty after
you have appealed to your earth teacher, then to your
guides, then to the master, so that it requires three
stages of asking before the final fourth stage when you
appeal to the Logos. His vibration is an expensive one.

have the same reaction that you have when you appeal
to a Logos when your earth teacher, your astral guide,
and then your master are directly in line to obtain
knowledge from before you appeal to the Logos.
God is the definite and will convey all knowledge to

But concentration for the help of a Logos is prayer.
Concentration or direct asking of the earth teacher, the

for help. Only two deities may be prayed to—God
and Logos. The Logos does not consider your asking as
prayer, but it is so considered by us.
Mental efforts which desire the opening of the eyes
while sitting for clairvoyance should be fought. When
sitting for clairvoyance keep the eyes closed. Strain the
ears for hearing because it is a very fine, keen voice that
comes first and is very hard to hear. While sitting for
clairvoyance, throw the head back, lift the eyes back,
rest the hands on the knees and with the palms down1
and relax as much as possible. Do not, however, ever
be so relaxed that you forget your purpose in sitting.
Many who sleep while doing this are too much relaxed.
Drink a glass of water before sitting for clairvoyance and
keep your stomach clear.

Cosmic Science 1
MAN AND HIS BODIES
THE
astral plane is a plane above the earth or phys
ical plane, and it is with this plane that we are
concerned at this time, because it is to this plane
that we travel after leaving the earth plane. In order
that we may get a better understanding of this plane,
we must first have a better understanding of ourselves.
A man has a number of bodies, not one alone as is gen
erally supposed. One is the physical, or earth body; one,
the astral or the soul body, is the body which survives
after death, and it contains the other three bodies, which
it retains after laying down the physical.
The ego is contained in the astral into which it pene
trates; the ego may also absorb the physical and pro
duce emanations; it is the body with which you feel
and respond to all vibrations; it enables you to smell,
to hear, to taste, to think, and to feel, as well as to re
spond to intelligent thought of all kind. Without it
you would be inanimate. All souls contain the ego ex
cept those whose ego has been taken away by God. The
Ego will contain itself if the physical body is destroyed,
but it may not live without the physical body, there
fore, it changes its nature when the physical body dies,
assuming the appearance of vapor. While it is in the
physical body it cannot be distinguished from it except
by a psychic; he can register its presence by its vibration.
The astral body also responds to the touch of the
physical body, but cannot contact the infinite without
the mental body which is contained by the side of the
Ego. These two bodies resemble twin souls in appear
ance when seen from the higher planes. The human
looks like he were three in one when seen from the
higher planes. His emanations gather around him like
a cloud of light.

The mental body responds to those who direct en

sponsible for all the nerve functions, emotions, etc.
Nothing in the human can be done without it. Every
one has it except idiots. The soul is another body, the
real body, or the body supreme. It travels to the ex
treme ends of the solar system and to other planets
seeking wisdom. The soul never enters the physical body
proper, but may operate all other bodies. The soul in
turn is under the direction of the Logos who controls
it completely. The physical body itself has positively
no intelligence whatsoever.
The personality of a student while developing under
goes a great change. People who contact him will ex
perience desire to leave him alone. This is but a reaction
of the student to be left alone. They usually shun com
panions. This is natural and is but the reaction of a
chemical nature. While students are developing their
psychic powers they are continually throwing off chem
icals different from that which they usually throw off.
Many students become ill. Some have fevers and some
want to lie around. All are indifferent to people around
them. The appetite will suffer occasionally and head
aches occur. No notice must be taken of these things.
The mental attitude should be carefully watched. No
humiliation should be allowed. The student should be
taught to be positive in his actions. They should be
taught that it is better to go slowly before forming an
opinion upon anything. They should never anger.
They should never allow people who are angry to come
anywhere near their surroundings. It would be better
to separate themselves entirely from people than that
one ray. of. anger should come within touch . of their
physical at this period.
The number of students who come to grief during
the elementary psychic development period is very great,
due, principally, to the fact that they have not an in
telligent teacher to guide them. Many mediums on
earth undertake the responsibility of holding classes and
teaching students when they are not capable of hand

ling their own affairs. The mentality of a teacher
should be studied carefully by an intended student and
the student should be taught by the teacher at all times
to decide his own affairs. Occasionally it is necessary
for a student to ask a teacher about his private affairs,
but he should be taught that it is better for him to
stand alone and decide his own private affairs.
When a student has reached the telepathic stage of
development his astral teachers are alwlys~afbund him,
especially are they around him when his body is regis
tering desire. They endeavor to give his brain the
thought and when he asks a question several times, sev
eral kinds of solutions to the problem will usually be
presented for his vision. He should study these prob
lems in their entirety and carefully weigh the result of
each problem deciding finally on the solution to the
problem which shows a greater result for good. Stu
dents who sleep out of doors will always react better
to development than those who stay within the house.
Light played on a student while he is developing has
an effect upon him which is very wonderful. He should
always enjoy light. He should sit in sunlight. He
should enjoy the rays of lamps and at all times bathe
himself carefully with illumination. The illumination
that is spoken of throughout various cults is one which
is not understood very much by their teachers, but we
tell you that light is the meaning of illumination. Nev
er sleep in the light. Darkness is necessary in order that
a brain substance be allowed to react chemically and re
new itself. It can only do this when light is absent.
Hence, it is better in psychic development for one to
sleep in a positively black dark room. Air, however,
should not be excluded.
The exercises mentioned before this should be con
sidered very carefully. No very stout person should
indulge in these exercises in their entirety. The first
lesson of bending from the waist and touching the
toes is the only one that they should do. The strain
of raising the torso from the floor is too great an ef
fort for a very stout person and time must elapse be

THE ASTRAL WORLD
'HEN a man is to die, the time is always known
before hand to receive him. The physical body
is caused to lie still, then told to breathe fast, which it
does except when it meets with an accident and is struck
too quickly. The physical is then given a tonic of
ether in his blood and allowed a minute or so to re
spond to the treatment. He is then separated from his
physical earth body by instruments provided for that
purpose. Meanwhile many astral people watch these
proceedings so that they may know how to act in a
like emergency. The person is then taken to the house
of cleaning where he receives a thorough cleaning and
is allowed to rest awhile. Here he receives another type
of treatment which enables him to get in touch with
his fluid which comes to him from another house. This
fluid strengthens him and enables him to walk proper
ly. He begins to take an interest in things around him
and wants to go home. He doesn't know that he has
passed over, and no one can make him realize it.
About this time his soul mate comes to him. She
may never have seen him before, but she knows he has
passed over. She takes him to the hospital where the
doctors look him over as well as anyone else who cares
to see him. Many take advantage of the opportunity
as his many sins have marked his astral body and the
results of sin are an object lesson to all who view him.
Then his soulmate gathers his many friends together
and repeats his sins to them and they advise her wheth
er to leave him or to stay with him. By this time he
cares for his soulmate a little and, if she decides to stay
she stays with him for further lessons which induce
him to learn of his value to himself —such as the value
of your hand or foot. So all the properties of the soul

are explained to him. These lessons continue until his
soulmate is satisfied that he knows how to conduct
himself before his equals. After this she will either
leave him to himself or go to his friends and ask them
to help him. Should his emanations or desires be too
bad, she will leave, and so will all other good souls.
Then will the older souls come and imprison his body
until he learns about God.
He is then treated as if for disease; the emanations
of God are forced into his body and they cure him, but
this takes time and he may be very unhappy for awhile,
for he must suffer while the evil emanations register
within him. This is his hell, and it lasts as long as he
holds out against God. Until he responds to the vi
brations of God, he suffers; his mind creates imaginary
people who fill his body with desires for evil things so
intense that he is in terrible pain from them, but they
never come to him. No harm is allowed to come to
him, but his suffering is intense. His consciousness tells
him he is wrong, but sometimes his desire is stronger,
and so desire for evil must vanish before he is released
from suffering.
When the earth body is buried beneath the ground
the astral workers go to it to treat it also. This becomes
necessary because it smells to that plane. Although this
does not affect the soul in any way neither does death
from explosives, or the burning of the body.
When a soul has learned its lessons satisfactorily; it
goes to its companions who take it to their homes
where they attend to its wants; clothes, houses, jobs,
education are furnished, but only to those who have
earned them, In fact, .unless you have done many good
deeds on earth, you are a pauper on the astral unless
friends supply you.
If your mind could always have its way, you would
always be in God's vibration. It is always trying to
conduct good vibrations to you. But the soul some
times conflicts with the mind because it cannot under
stand why the mind wants to draw it from earth de
sires.

All the earth conditions exist on the astral as they
do on earth as well as a great many more. For instance,
they have factories, houses, trees, furniture, etc. In fact,
everything on earth has a counterpart on the astral, and
some things are much further advanced, for it must be
remembered that all thought comes from there. Also
all the religious sects are there, but no man may con
tinue to do evil before he is hounded to hell.
This is no particular district; it is a condition of
mind or mental depression like that of a drug fiend.
The Logos operates on their m°ntal bv thought and
sends them into jails of sin. All these people contain
no sane thoughts, and are confined together and are
looked at onlv when they desire to be released. No
food is necessary for them; thev would never consume
it; thev cannot contain themselves long enough away
from their evil emotions: the astral bodv does not eat.
The physical bodv which leaves your body at death
also dies after a day or so.
Hell is a place of silence; it would resound with ter
rific cries were sound allowed, but all who go there are
condemned to silence, their voices are hushed in their
anguish. They confess their misdeeds to each other,
but never realize that God will give them relief until
thev are taught. If a teacher spits on you, spit on him,
is their idea; therefore, thev must learn not to do so.
Later thev are taught to love him who teaches them.
When they have learned this, they are lifted to God
where they produce love vibrations; then they are in
heaven.
The astral world is a beautiful place to live in. All
things are intense and register around the positive plane,
all entities never lose sight of the fact that God is their
master.
There can be no war on the astral plane because the
rulers can subdue all thought of war. No soul may
ever kill another, they have their fights, but these are
comoetitions of vibrations and are amusing to watch.

but they are throwing vibrations as fast as they can at
one another to subdue each other.
There is sex in the astral world, but no creative
thought. As far as creative thought is concerned, astral
people produce thought creations, but they are always
inanimate objects and may have no life unless the high
er forces give it.
The astral body is similar to the earth body in ap
pearance, but its composition is different, it is of a
denser, gaseous state, being held together by a fluid of
magnetic type similar to electricity. It is detached from
the physical body, therefore, not of it.
Life is given the astral bodies by the Logos, it oper
ates in it like a breath of vapor. The Logos does the
work of God through the mental body. This body vit
alizes both the astral and the earth body and makes it
appear more vital and radiant. The soul and the men
tal bodies never argue; they respond to each other's in
fluence for good. No vibration of earth may enter into
a soul. Finally it comes into the second stage of living
and passes to the Logos bounds where it contracts into
a smaller space; then it is another body which resembles
a bird's body. Its eyes are larger than the earth body
and the nose resembles a bird's beak. The features are
longer as also is the body. The face is very beautiful
and the legs have entirely disappeared.
In the second stage of existence, the astral body is in
another vibration where no thoughts of animosity may
ever penetrate, and all conversation must be definite.
The higher one progresses, the more definite things be
come. All earth things are delusion; they are the result
of vibration which other vibrations may destroy. No
definite soul may be destroyed by vibrations.
The mind body, which is the real body that endures
through eternity as far as we have been able to ascer
tain, is made up of love vibrations entirely and is of
God's emanations. No mind body ever goes to hell;
it would release itself. The astral and the mental bod
ies cannot do this. If a mind were confined by a Logos,

USES OF MENTAL TELEPATHY
THE
object of conversing with spiritual forces is
one that is of vital importance, because of its use
a student is able to gauge his behavior and con
tact desirable acquaintances on the earth plane. Also
he may evade danger or illnesses which might assail
him were he not in direct communication with people
who had knowledge of these forthcoming events.
History is full of incidents wherein numerous people
have been warned of grievous happenings about to be
and they have sometimes taken advantage of this knowl
edge and used it to their advantage.
The intellectual student will not be so much con
cerned with foretelling futures or casting horoscopes
for future reference of his friends as he will be interest
ed in gathering information about the world which sur
rounds him. Were his mentality only average and his
interest only in that of earth itself, one would still bene
fit very greatly by understanding those things with
which he came in daily contact. The elimination of var
ious foods from his diet; the associations with whom
he came in contact; the restriction of undesirable hab
its, all of these things could be learned about and it is
of the utmost importance that the student thoroughly
makes up his mind as to what his future desire is going
to be. When mental telepathy is established and the
sense of hearing is fully developed, it then becomes a
question as to whether you are seriously inclined or oth
erwise. If seriousness is your dominant nature, then you
will necessarily bring serious people from the astral to
teach you on one hand and to question you on the oth
er. A little light on this subject will give you some
understanding of things which are not usually under
stood by earth mediums. They arrive at a conclusion
or conclusions regarding astral forces which sometimes

are but the reflection of their own ideas. The direct
conversation which usually results between an astral
being and the earth student must be a harmonious one,
otherwise the mind will be stopped. Each must have the
interests of the other's desire in mind so that when one
comes in anger to the other, it is quite evident that there
can be no sustained connection and no prolonged con
versation. This would be evident even among earth
people, therefore, it is vitally necessary for the earth
student to first decide the type of individual he wishes
to converse with. This could be ascertained by decid
ing on a course of study. His interests might run to
flowers, to machinery, to vegetation, to animals, to psy
chic phenomena, to art, to carving, or numerous other
things with which he is familiar. I am referring at
this time to one particular piece of statuary which is,
to my mind, the dominant piece of statuary in the
world; that is "The Thinker" by Rodin. A remark
able thought should convolute through the brain of a
student when he fully grasps the immensity of the
Thinker's scope of action.
The thought between the two conversant people
must be, first; on an equal mental plane. One mav sur
pass the other in knowledge, but each must be able to
grasp fullv the other's meaning. Therefore, it is unwise
for an earth student who is not versed in technical
terms or expressions to seek the contact of one in the
astral plane who has spent his earth life or his astral
life in a technical school. It is usually wisest to ask for
a teacher on a given subject without referring definitely
to an identical. This leaves your guides the choice of
teachers to come to you and usually they have a thor
ough understanding of your requirements. The one
thought of desire is usually sufficient to handle your sit
uation, but sometimes it is necessary to be more ex
plicit and state definitely what your requirements are
in a teacher.
Knowledge of earth conditions is one that is sought
by a good many astral people. Their interest is to as
certain about your life and measure it with other peo

pie's experiences. In this way sometimes they can gath
er enough knowledge about earth conditions and hap
penings, etc., without having the necessity forced upon
them of coming to earth in a physical body, living on
earth as you have to live on it. One wonders some
times, at least all earth people wonder, why the spirit
ual being or astral being should concern himself about
contacting. The solution to the problem is this; as we
journey onward to the engineering fields which all must
pass through and we receive instruction in various works
such as making some particular small creation or re
ceiving some other instruction about handling a force
which has to do with handling engineering problems or
some creation.
We receive instruction from time to time that sur
passes earth knowledge, but our work eventually will
be to take the place of intelligences who are now teach
ing us. A full knowledge of all creations must be ac
complished before we may become a Logos, so that it
is in line with our instructor's ideas for us to contact
anything or anybody or any being that can give us
first knowledge on any given thing so that we can
sometimes get a sufficient data from a student either by
watching him or by questioning him in a certain set
of experiences or about a subject.
Our life is a governed one. We may gather informa
tion, but must abide by certain conditions and stay
within certain instructions while doing so.
Natural law is a definite law and nothing existent
may step outside of it. Earth people are restricted to
live in air. We are restricted to live in air also. There
are other beings who do not live in air. There are
beings who live in fire. There are some who live on
the sun which, in itself, is a gigantic living flame, yet
that makes no difference to their mentals for there is
simply a chemical reaction when you change from your
body to another and it becomes necessary to eliminate
some particles and take on other particles which cer
tain elements may not destroy. This is the entire se

simply a method of tuning oneself to live in a certain
chemical and one must accomplish this by knowledge.
Under certain conditions we are carried along uncon
sciously and forcibly adapted to a new condition. This
is the work of the masters. But you see that behind it
all there is the definite mind and so, if you are to be
come useful and to experience the greater sensations and
to have an intelligent consciousness of life in general,
you must study everything that surrounds one.
The definite forces with which we daily contact de
rive very much pleasure from contacting any intelligent
soul, so the definite aim of all students of psychic work
is to first gather every piece of wisdom they are capable
of gathering about their earth life. Look around you
intelligently, study everything and everyone and seek
the truth in all things. Prove every thought by com
parison. Be tolerant of other people's ideas. Compare
them with your own deductions and then grasp the
mighty truth that lies within all reasoning. This leads
to a higher phase of mentality and far surpasses sitting
in darkened rooms for hands to touch you or clouds to
form on your brow. Ridiculousness is never a good
thing to indulge in; fakir's claims are never a wise
thing to indulge in. The truth is self-evident to people
and requires no camouflage. There is too much truth yet
to learn to waste time on ridiculous things or those
things which are manufactured truths.
Describe mental processes to each other, but do not
rebel against the thought of any individual.

Cosmic Science 4
THE LOGOS
THE
Logos are a type of spiritual force, inactive on
the Earth Plane. While successive demonstrations
of their presence on the Astral Plane teach the as
tral workers to respect their word, no matter how con
fident they feel that they are able to accomplish a thing
against them, the Logos dominate. The appearance of
a Logos is that of a set of vibrations. The earth mind
cannot imagine what a set of vibrations could look like.
They differ from emanations in that they have colour.
No man could see unless vibrations existed, but the as
tral eyes can see vibrations. If a human ever saw a Lo
gos he could not live, he would be stimulated until his
vibrations would be too fast, then he would die. Lo
gos create all things on the astral, gives all desires, pro
tects all his workers, builds to God all deserving souls,
lights the path of progression to all men, creates chil
dren, designs newer creations, controls all men and rules
all planets, in fact, Logos are dominant in all matters on
the astral, but may only suggest on earth. Men must
desire their assistance or they may not assist them.
To gather more data on these beings one must ap
proach to a higher state of perfection than the average
earth mind because they surpass the earth mind's power
of description. It is sufficient to say that they cannot
be seen, but their works may be seen in all nature. Each
is a teacher and has his own special field to teach and
does it thoroughly. Some create vegetation, some rocks,
some combine elements, and others teach the astral
workers to work on earth materials. All creations on
earth whether they be humans, fish, trees, or anything
else have their attendants from the astral plane who
direct their progress.
While the Logos creates at will and supervises all
things, he also destroys if he so desires, if the results

will balance in the favor of God. He would not hesi
tate to destroy whole civilizations if the results were
worth the destruction. He is your benefactor and loves
all God's workers; he is all powerful and all loving;
terrible if he condemns,, but merciful always to the soul
that desires to progress. Asking for the help of the Lo
gos is prayer. Logos abound in the regions of planets
only when working, at other times they leave our solar
system entirely. Their structure is not of known earth
elements; it is of other matter, but evidently of God,
because light is one of their methods of approach; they
use it to approach earth.
A Logos is definite, but of immense type, his con
volutions convex into a series of manifestations in cre
ation. To determine his size, or to prepare a descrip
tion of his personality, to definitely understand his
means of progression is to equal him in knowledge, con
sequently, to equal him in regard for God. This in it
self would be to create yourself anew until you became
a Logos. Define no Logos by his mental efforts to con
trol you. His reaction is all you register. Direct energy
is never directed to your brain. To annihilate a human
is never his act, but to create minds equal to his. To
definitely confine a human to earth is against a Logos;
to definitely confine a human to heaven is to become a
Logos in power.

PSYCHOMETRY
'
I 'HE student should by this time be conscious of the
J[ fact that he is much more sensitive than hereto
fore.
In studying psychometry it is very necessary that a
student should relax and hold his concentration entire
ly on his emotions. He should gauge his very mental
attitude. He should feel the warmth of his body. He
should feel the nervous tension and should register ev
ery emotion that passes through his physical. To do
this he must have experimented without holding an ar
ticle belonging to some other person and have become
familiar with himself. He should know his own re
action. He should know exactly what his normal con
dition is so that when you pick up an article belonging
to another person you are able to gauge the difference
in your emotion after you have contacted it.
A good method of carrying out this experiment is to
pick an article up and hold it for a few seconds and try
to notice the change that comes over your feelings and
then put it down and allow yourself to relax back into
a normal condition again. For example; we might
choose an object that had belonged to a man who suf
fered with headaches. Immediately the student psychic
picks up the article he very likely would feel uncom
fortable around the forehead. As the contact continued
with the article, he would gradually assume the con
dition of the person who originally owned the article.
This is a peculiar condition that is only prevalent when
articles are touched which have belonged to people who
were suffering physically. Now, on the other hand,
should a picture be brought to the mind of the student
which, when he picks the article up, closes his eyes, he
will usually find his eyes will be closed for him if this

is necessary, this would be evidence that a picture was
to be given to him. Then his faculties would be con
centrated on seeing what was being shown with the
article. Clairvoyance is used here and clairaudience and
emotional forces are also used.
If an article belonging to a sailor is used, one may
hear the roar of the sea and interpret the message that
the article belonged to some one near the sea or who
went to sea. Then again, one may sway on one's feet
as if standing on a ship. This would be another way
to determine that this was an article belonging to a
seafaring person. Then again we might take a piece of
coal and immediately the history of the coal may begin
to manifest itself. You may see the tree ferns that grew
at the time when the coal was a tree. You may see the
animals which roamed the forests at that period. You
may see the miner digging out the coal. It depends on
just what message the astral forces desire to convey to
you. It also depends on what your interest is in pick
ing up the article. If your interest is that of giving a
material message to some friend or client, then the as

We might say at this time that the article itself does
not hold these sounds, but it does have a connection

it must bring associations to the front if they are de

to be gone into later. At this time it is enough to state

FINITE CONTROLS
FINITE control is a being who has only developed
his astral sense. To understand this you must im
agine yourself in a gloomy cave groping around
without seeing. This is the state of mind of a finite
control. He is always seeking for substantial substance
to reveal a way out of his punishment; to attach him
self to a human is always his desire because he is fa
miliar with earth conditions. No infinite being ever
desires anything earthly.
The difference between a finite being and an infinite
being is that the desire for earth is dominant in a finite
and the desire for the ethereal is dominant in an infin
ite. Finite controls are always dominant when anger is
aroused or when passion is accentuated. To enjoy the
contact with the human, the finite would destroy all
before him if he were able. Always he carries love for
evil, and no real progress is ever made while a finite is
allowed to register. Contact is always made with a
finite in the evening; no morning spirit is a finite. Fi-
nites work in darkness; light beings work in the dark
ness and sleep in the darkness, but may prolong their
contact after darkness if necessary. Light is always de
nied a finite. Laws govern his body's vibrations, such
as blinding his eyes or depriving his organs of their ac
tions. For instance: deprive a man of his eyesight and
he will not rush about destroying; so deny a finite his
power and he may do no injury. As contact is made
with good, a finite must withdraw. Therefore, as all
good thoughts are part of God's kingdom, so do you
repel all undesirable things within you, and undesirable
beings who would indulge themselves at your expense
or to your detriment.
There are earthly finites who would devour your
substance and leave you without. You should protect

yourself against them. They work as much ill in the
earth plane as they do on the astral, but these earth
bodies are subject to finite controls when they attempt
to absorb your earth rights. The contact with pleasure
that men get in viewing a fellow creature's agony is
an example of the pleasure that a finite gets in viewing
destruction through his handiwork.
To build against a finite one must destroy his con
tact by thinking good thoughts; to oppose him does not
anger him, it only weakens his resolution to be evil. To
agree with him is to deflect light from your own soul.
Each thought of evil allowed to register brings the next
connecting thought, and a train of evil follows. Thoughts
then result which may carry you to hell itself; one evil
thought may reduce you to a thousand years of hell be
cause you are responsible for your thoughts, although
you do not become responsible for them until you allow
them to register. Even then you may be saved if you
allow no further evil to result. If an evil thought
registers, kill it with a good thought and, if in doubt
appeal to God. Love is always a rejection of a finite
thought. To repel him do not anger. To anger you
is his desire; it would gratify him; he is always of low
mentality. There is no sex in a finite although the ap
pearance may be that of a man or a woman. No sex
organs are visible, no power of creation as understood
on earth, is possible; he may create by thought as you
may on earth, but no evil, only good. His creations may
even take form and function for a while, but the au
thorities soon seek them out and destroy them. They
may not be classed as evil in other planets, but they are
against earth people's ideas, and so the Logos confine all
minds that register them.
The distinction between mind and matter is one that
occurs along about the twenty-seventh year of a per
son's life on earth. There is usually a time when they
begin to be able to discern the so-called spiritual. Up
to this time everything is very material and matter-of-
fact. No two people think alike. Each has his own

individual thoughts and usually conducts himself ac
cording to these facts.
The mentals of people differ very greatly because of
their construction. The planetary influences have very
little to do with the construction of a mental, yet many
earth people attribute their failings to planetary forces.
No planetary force can make a failure of an earth per
son. Their destiny is one that is not particularly mark
ed. The only thing that is marked about them is the
fact that they must live within certain natural laws.
No air breathing person could breathe fire ; no air breath
ing person, at least one who breathed air in large quan
tities, could live under water; neither could they move
around when buried in the earth. Consequently the
manner of the human physical has very much to do
with the man in which it lives, thinks, eats, etc. The
mental also is subject to restrictions somewhat sim
ilar to that of the earth body. No mental could stand
terrific heat because its very nature would make it go
away from the heat. Neither could it stand terrific cold
because its nature would make it leave that vicinity. So
earth people must not imagine that because they are un
der the influence of the planet somewhat that planets
have very much to do with their doings on the earth
plane. Men of intellect conduct themselves accordingly.
Denizens of the underworld break society's rules be
cause of the ignoramuses that they associate with. Re
flections of other people's minds, other people's men
talities occur because they are not strong enough or not
in strong enough tune with a higher mind. If their
own mind is not sufficiently intellectual to make them
conduct themselves intelligently, then a new mind or a
stronger mjnd is necessary to accomplish this fact. This
is the reaction of all earth people because one earth per
son with a powerful mind, a dominant personality, can
control hundreds of thousands of others. Sometimes
they do this through intelligent concentration, by us
ing knowledge that they possess of natural forces, or
again by reasoning with the intelligent members of the
earth horde. The others follow blindly like sheep; they

go wherever the leader calls them. A man with a per
sonality can gather to himself a number of people and
begin a doctrine. This doctrine can be evil or good ac
cording to the dictates of his own mind. Should he be
allowed to continue, there will always be quite a num
ber of physicals who will follow at random. However,
this condition of affairs never lasts very long because
the truth will become evident to greater mentals of those
who are following and they will begin to contact other
minds who will direct them in the true path. So it is
that all disturbances on the earth plane are eventually
corrected.
Habits of people have a great deal to do with the
so-called sin. Much of this is not sin, but is the reac
tion of physical life in conflict with earth influences and
mental influences by habits of earth contact. Men re
spond lovingly to embraces, women likewise. Others
do not embrace. That is but one form of contact.
Men steal from other men because they lack those
things which the others have. An equal distribution
should be accomplished, then stealing would not be a
fact. Health giving articles produce life giving fluids.
These fluids must be used to the best advantage in an
earth physical. Superabundance of fluid should be used
in a creative way. Many ununderstandable things oc
cur to people which could be directed into useful chan
nels if they were looked at intelligently. Conscience does
not direct correctly. Conscience is but a system worked
out by society for the protection of some particular law.
These laws usually are of no account. The natural law
only is of any account. The definite always illustrates
his methods by giving joy and happiness. Happiness
is the one thing that one can look forward to if he be
comes natural. ;
Desire is apparent in all creatures, and people cannot
exist in the astral unless they desire. No person can
live in an earth body unless it desires to do so. The
cosmic is full of people who wander continually from
place to place trying to attach themselves to understand
able people—people who will give them things —peo

No purer soul can exist than the Logos; he is the defin

growth in humans the rebirth of the astral body with
in the earth physical is necessary. This corresponds
with the new birth spoken of by Jesus. His mental
body recovered his astral after the crucifixion and ap

To rebuild to God while yet in the physical earth
body is to become infinite while still on earth. When
you register this more wisdom is evident in your con

or mean thoughts; they always throw evil away from
them, therefore, examples of this rebirth are evident in

Unfoldment XVI
HEALING
WHEN
a student has begun to get pictures that
are presentable, that should be sufficient proof
to them that forces do work through them.
The next phase of the work is in itself more glorious
and beneficial to humanity than any other. Doubtless
while you were doing the automatic painting, you won
dered what use it could be in your unfoldment. The
particular reason why you must go through this stage
of development is that you are being prepared to have
the medical worker handle you, and the exact control
necessary to enable an artist to paint a picture through
you is necessary in medical work. One of the first steps
to be taken by a student when beginning healing is to
select a subject for practice, preferrably a fellow student,
and lay him flat on his back. If you are fortunate
enough to find a subject that has some ailment, that is
so much the better. The student should stand at the
head of the patient, place one hand —the right one —
on the forehead of the patient, then allow the hand to
be moved as in automatic painting or writing. Use no
will power of your own, but allow the hand to go vol
untarily to any part of the patient's body it so desires.
Sometimes the student's body will be moved about, then
the other hand will be brought into activity. This
should be continued at least once a day.
The student will notice that his hands will become
speckled and red. This is the action of the healing
forces working through him. He should also listen to
the mental diagnosis and comments of the astral doctor
who is teaching him and follow his directions perfectly.
He should have confidence in his teacher both on the
astral and in the physical. He must remember that he

is not the healer, but the instrument, and he must
learn by observation.
Care should be taken when beginning healing not
to touch the face with the hands or any part of your
own body. Should you do so, you may burn yourself,
but this also you will learn from experience.
Remember to forget the patient immediately you are
finished with him and positively do not allow yourself
to take on his condition or pains. If you should find
this occurring, mentally decide that it is not part of
you, that you are physically well and will have none
of it. Cancer may be cured in this way as well as tu
mor and many other afflictions. Realize that the astral
world can do things the physical cannot.
Love your teacher.

THE DEFINITE AND THE
INDEFINITE
ALL
things which change form continually are less
￼
definite than those whose changing periods are at
longer intervals. Hence, the indefiniteness of the hu
man body—a baby at birth with a continual physical
growth; always indefinite until the death period; then,
for awhile a mental; after that, the structure of the bird
type, which type exists for millions of years we are
told. Life everlasting is a definite thing. All God's
work is definite, therefore, may not be destroyed.
Many things exist which man knows little if any
thing of, many millions of creations surround him,
even in the material plane, which are positive, but he
does not register them with his eyes. The fault is not
his because his structure will not permit their registra
tion. Perhaps they are too minute, perhaps their colour
is not one he can register, perhaps he vibrates on an
other plane, all these things prevent his seeing them and
sometimes prevents his feeling them, or even detecting
their presence.
No human can register an angel, yet they walk with
him today; angels walk on earth even in crowds; they
approach a human and speak to him, he hears them
subconsciously and will turn to look at them, but in
the end will turn away without having seen them.
They will be acknowledged by people of the future.
Their strata is superior to the earth strata; it is more
definite, only its colours are paler; no deep colour is
visible in their world. They sometimes lie at the feet
of man and teach him while he sits, but more often
they walk with him to direct his footsteps. A child
always has a guardian angel with it. Men of intellect
may seek out their guides if narcotics are not used. Their
guides rebel against drugs and will not approach a

drug fiend. No help may come to an addict of morphia
until they reject the drugs; it is particularly obnoxious
to angelic forces.
One must realize by this time that all these forces
are physical, and various chemical difficulties must be
overcome to contact them. It must be realized that the
material essence of God matter is chemical in structure
and, as such, provision must be made to harmonize
with its nature. It alone is the positive definite; from
it all things have come and to it all things may return
eventually.

THOUGHT
THOUGHT
is an emanation of force operated by
God to convey his command to various planes. In
order to convey a definite plan to a person it is
necessary to make a thought form. This form is con
stantly changing, and until it is a definite form, it is
not sent to its destination. This is a form of recrea
tion of the vounger astral beings who take much pleas
ure in producing these forms, and they certainly pro
duce sorne peculiar things. If thev have no evil in them
their cre^or is allowed to continue, but should there
be anything which may injure a person's vibrations
their creator would be confined. In this way the mind
of the astral being is known to the other.
Definiteness is the main object in the astral world.
To produce a definite form it is necessary to think a
staple definite form and be satisfied with it, otherwise
it would change with every new thought. If it regis
ters as a definite form for a space of time, it is despatched
to the next recipient who is to do further work. This
recipient mav be on earth or in Venus or Eros or Mars
or in any other planet in the heaven. His identity may
not even be known, but a random thought may pro
duce no results to its creator. A thought despatched
definitely to a definite recipient will have a definite re
sult. This is what counts, and the results are marked
in a register.
To enjoy the fruits of your thoughts, you must pro
duce the good you have done. To produce evil will de
stroy an equal amount of good. To destroy good is
easy by making evil. But no good thought may ever
be destroyed, they will be driven out of shape probablv,
but will return to their creator again some day. To
produce thought forms, concentrate. Thought forms

articles, some experiment with machinery, some create
animals, some produce vibrations, some are artistic,
some are musical, some eliminate noise, some make
more, some repel passion, some make it, some are gas
eous, some are physical, some are magnetic, some are
ethereal; all are definite; some result in earth creations,
some may rebound to destroy their creators, and many
kill the souls that created them; their minds then have
no vehicle to work with, so that the mind is more than
careful to control its soul.
To be physical always would be a deplorable state
of affairs. To be perfect on earth would never be heav
en, it may suffice for awhile, but one would grow tired
of living on earth; to live through centuries of that
kind of life would be too dull and stupid. On the as
tral, a difference is always in sight, newer vibrations are
continually coming which always result in new ideas,
along every conceivable line of thought. It is necessary
for a mental body as well as a physical. The tune of
reasoning is vastly different in different minds; some are
finite in development, some are lower than finite.
SOLAR CONTROLS
Th least understood force in the earth world is the
Solar Control. He is elemental to a very great degree,
he intends to contact humans, but sometimes he con
tacts birds or vegetation.
Light is his most useful vibration of contact, and
for this reason we may believe that he is opposite evil;
however, no true analysis has ever been made of his
purpose in contacting. To determine the result of their
contacts scientists on the astral have been working for
thousands of years. One of the results on humans is
known. The appearance of a person contacting them
changes to blue, especially the lips, and their disposition
changes to a very violent one ; they will also expel foam
from the lips in small quantities. But so far no knowl
edge is known of their purpose in contacting earth.
To effect settlement of vibrations seems to be their
work. Vibrations which become red under their influ
ence may be destroyed by them, the catastrophies which

occur are generally the result of their influence. No vi
bration on earth may be destroyed without the knowl
edge of the solar controls, and evidently they rule the
elements of destruction.
The reaction of the heavenly bodies to their pres
ence always gives the impression of immense force, one
single ray penetrating a rock will destroy it. So their
personalities must be immense, yet we cannot attach
any given shape to their structure. Light is the greatest
asset that the astral scientist has in registering their
presence. The astral world is surrounded by many
forces and beings which are unseen to them, even as the
same condition exists on the earth plane.
The solar control destroys men because of its ignor
ance to their proximity. He does not seem to know
when to lessen his contact. He teaches all God's king
dom at a glance, he flashes God's message at a glance,
but continued pressure of his force destroys human tis
sue. Therefore, when one has risen in vibration to be
susceptible to contact, it is wise to stop until his is past
one. No ray of light is so intense as his vibration, his
pitch is musical, and many musicians go mad, because
they contact his ray.
The intent of the solar control is never a very def
inite one; he does not seem to contact anything with a
definite end in view. His appearance is never registered,
all life seems to interest him and his nature seems to
absorb them. To define him we would say: an absorb
ent control who absorbs vibrations belonging to God
and repelling evil.
DEAMS
One of the least known creations that exist on earth
is that of the Deam. This creation is never at rest. Its
form cannot register to the human eye, yet its construc
tion is due to the direct action of human thought.
The creative qualities of human thought are not yet
fully realized by humans. The fact that the brain con
structs images in the earth plane is not yet comprehend

work, but the creative ability of humans does not stop
here. It creates beings which take definite form and be
gin to register as living beings. For that reason the
thought form that the angry mother may devise to de
stroy an enemy really does spring into existence and
turn on its opponent in the astral. To make a form and
leave it to work out its destiny is not desirable, and to
produce an evil being by thought makes contact difficult
for divine forces.
The most desirable form that the human thought
constructs is that of a Deam. These minute creations are
the direct result of desiring to help a person to eat. To
send a helping thought to a hungry person is to revolve
the brain to a Deam production. When the creative
force is expended, the Deam is in existence and appeases
all desire for hunger in the system of the person for
whom it was created. It is like a tonic thrown from
helper to helped by thought, and in reality, it is a life-
giving tonic and as such is part of the helper's vitality.
This force is loaned to the helped. Eventually the Deam
surrounds itself with particles and begins to take form.
Its master was the person who first gave it form and
he is directly responsible to God for its creation and
for its future actions. It develops a body later and
grows into a microscopic insect. This further evolves
until it reaches the perfection of man. The construction
of a Deam is of a good vibration, and it will adhere to
good vibrations until it sins, then evil may manifest.
This fluid may be counteracted if desire is expressed to
the Logos to redeem all your creations which have sin
ned or which will not live rightly. You may reduce
them to the original status of beings and take them
back into yourself again.
This is the principle of all creation, and if man con
tinues to sin against God, God will redeem them all
and they will flow to him again in streams. But oppor
tunity will never be given again for them to become
vital creatures and work ill. Deams which emanate
from God himself will also become men, but his method
of combating evil is to redeem men. Therefore, to sin
is to die.

necessary to understand that a birth on earth means a
death on the astral. The fact that a member of an as
tral family chooses to become a habitant of an earth
body corresponds with the view that humans have of
the passing over. The dance of death is called "Meny".
It consists of a dance in which a review of the destiny
of the one about to depart is given. He rules for one
hour before he is born, then, his death is announced.
He is not then allowed to correct himself before the as
tral people; he is banished to earth to control his child
body. This is a punishment always to a soul because
he must leave heaven and be sent to earth to convey his
child body through life. It is a restricted duty and al
ways meets with opposition before he becomes attached
to it by love which binds his emanations to the child
body. He is imprisoned until the corresponding rebirth
on the astral again. Inducement is allowed him to pro
test to the Logos about his imprisonment if he desires,
but many respect their duty to the earth body and lis
ten to the Logos call to inflict no injury on the earth
body. Its convolutions before birth were many. Forma
tion of the soul takes place before the soul desires to es
tablish himself in it.
The mental also must control the earth body as it
forms in the female-registering its heat, directing its
shape, determining its chemical reaction to salts, its fluid
contents, its reaction to men, its irritable desires—all
are registered by the mental.
The soul forms its contour. The back part of the
body is charted. It is written in full; all descriptions of
the zodiac are on it; all destinies, all notations of birth

The supremacy of man over animals has been ques
tioned by the animals for ages. To the mental of the
human this fact
is
self-evident, but to the mental of the
infinite no supremacy

evident. God-given mentals
are the lot of all. The subconscious mind
is
a
myth; no
such mind exists;

law of definite consciousness
is
all.
No partial consciousness exists. One must be con
scious either in one plane or the other. The intellect of
the animal
is
questioned by men, but he has only used
earth judgments, and they lack accuracy. The ravages
of the earth plane on the mental of the human
is
al
ways reflected in the mental of the human, therefore, he
is
always biased in favor of his kind. Remarkable evi
dence
is
apparent in insects of their superiority even in
earth standards. As
a
creation they are the embodiment
of perfection in design for their purpose. No human
could out distance them in speed, thought or execution
of their designs. Intricate works of art never appear

and insects carve lovely designs in nature's way.
f .-"Man most .le$trh by seeing, hearing, touching, and
reasoning-," so "friar he may progress out of ignorance.
Life- is- real; and its purpose is real. No supremacy is
possible undec .God'-s influence ; his matter dominates
all and all are subject to redemption, and the natural
law must be followed. The destroyer must be de
stroyed. To eliminate a life to protect a human is not
blessed. To eat meat is blessed; it is the one fault on
earth that is allowed—to kill—for food if necessary.
To kill in anger is not allowed. To progress to another
plane is desirable, and death is necessary for that pur
pose.
Whether a man desires to go further in pursuit of
knowledge is not altogether his own affair, but the affair
of the whole human family. Therefore, it is sometimes
necessary for him to be punished until he desires to
progress. If a man desires to go further in pursuit of
knowledge it would take years to convey that portion
of knowledge that the human brain could contain.
But the limit of the earth brain is of no consequence
because the mind will absorb all above the earth brain's
capacity. The mental efforts of men are varied, all that
is for men in general is absorption of knowledge; the
difference between the animal world and the human is
very limited and is not recognized on the astral. Souls
of men are also souls of animals, but no animal may reg
ister as a human until he has progressed to God. Many
men have also not progressed to God and, therefore, are
no better than animals. Knowledge is the supreme test
of all creatures.
JUPITER
The minds of Jupiter are rich in albumen; all al
bumen subjects call for treatment of astral doctors. To
earth doctors come the same controls because the medi
cal profession is directly under Jupiter. To eliminate
a Jupiterian control one eats large diets of meat and
he will leave. The Martian will destroy one if one
drives him away; the Jupiterian will not; he will leave.

All Jupiterians will release a mind if it desires to be
released. God or the Logos alone would be able to
save a mind if a Martian desired to destroy it. God
would interfere if called upon. One never should con
fine his thoughts to a Martian unless one desires to
force his way to God; he will assist then; his method
is always forceful.
Jupiter is earth's ruling planet, and Venus is con
tinually warning earth to respect Jupiter if it would
live. All particles that fly away from earth go to Jupi
ter.
To earth souls Jupiterians appear as a light; they
appear so bright there is no describing them. No men
in the field of Jupiter may ever compose themselves if
they destroy one of Jupiter's people; it would elimin
ate Jupiter from that section of earth. Only with the
Logos' permission may anything belonging to Jupiter
be injured. Jupiter is never a happy place; it is too
violent; its noises are too disturbing and the planet is
alive with reasonable laws which conflict with the na
tures of the people; whose natural environments rebel
against the natural physical planet. It is heated to an
extreme degree and its heights and depths are terrific.
The vegetation is also very large, according to the peo
ple themselves, the trees are of enormous heights. The
Jupiterian traverses space in his thought body and
earth men communicate with his astral body; they ad
mit their ignorance of many earth conditions.
The earth astral world draws many chemicals from
Jupiter. These come to earth on the ether train which
controls the movement of the earth and which also has
a tendency to draw astral forces to Jupiter.
GOD
The Mind Supreme is the definite mind. It cor
responds with the definite God of men's understanding.
To endow men with a portion of reasoning power, the
Supreme Mind gives a portion of itself to each man to
enable him to concentrate himself to itself. This men
tal attraction is recognized by man as intelligence.

In all structures of animal tissue the mind dominates.
To be more explicit, we would say the mind is con
scious of its origin and never tries to deny that fact. It
knows that to deny its existence is foolish, and it may
not receive further knowledge, until its thoughts react
To further influence a man's mind the greater mind
conveys tissue to it by thought which it wraps upon
itself clothing itself into a ball. This protects it in its
travel through space, so that the definite appearance of
a mind is that of a bill. All spherical structures one
visualizes may be classed as mind. To react against a
sphere is to react against God. A sphere is definite, and
all other things are indefinite. A round apple will last
longer than a square one so will anything else round
last longer than an angular.
Rigid substance again is of spherical shape, for rigid
substance must be composed of spherical substance to
endure. This is too evident in the cosmos to warrant
contradiction. To minds of the infinite type all en
ergy is transplanted.

MOVEMENT
O determine a power take a stone and throw it
J_ away from you; it will emerge into a structure;
this is energy. The inevitable consequences of dis
turbing atmosphere is to contract a human. His soul
may not register when there is action of material. To
register action in any form is to equal the stone in ve
locity. One rebounds to God by action. To enoble a
thought to convolute to a Logos is not allowed. Still
ness of all movement is necessary. Injury is always
inflicted by action, hence, the connection. To inflict
injury on a Satanic influence is to react to himself; it
injures one. To convolute into a heavenly atmosphere
gladness is necessary. To travel is to suffer; to even
move is to suffer. Remorse breeds in movement.
All movement is described as obnoxious by angels.
They are still. To understand this stand still for a space
of time and concentrate on angels, they will reveal
themselves to men in silence. No travel is allowed in
heaven. To rebel against heaven is to create a moving
thing. To create a moving thing is to set up friction;
friction is lost energy. Movement is expended energy;
energy is an emanation of God's kingdom.
Energy is supplied to earth by a stream of force
waves. These force waves continually come from the
asteroid cluster which surrounds the earth. This stream
of force waves is also a highway to other planets. Its
elements are a combination of ether, iron electro plasm,
emanate, graphen, lichbest, kinder, sipe, newel, gorb-
wen, sump, deam, leo, gross, den, grons, gies, mont,
bet, menson, nest, menst, gont, dest, onet, jon. These

it crumbles. Then the force waves entwine around the
earth a form of magnetic waves. These waves consist
of magnetism and millions of chemicals. The magnetic
fields are used by Logos of God to create and control.
The Logos regulate the velocity at which the earth
may revolve. The velocity never changes except when
a catastrophe happens then it changes to a slow one.
It is necessary to energize it again. This is done by
shutting the force stream off on one side. The other
side revolves it. Energizing the earth is the work of the
Logos.
To waste energy is the least desirable thing a person
can do. A fruitless effort to control destiny is to waste
energy. Destiny is destined to become fact, and fruit
ful souls will acclaim their desire to accomplish their
destiny regardless of other desires. Energy is on every
hand, it is the control of the Logos. He loves all ener
getic souls. They dissolve later in his fields of energy
and procreate in newer soul fields. Without them no
men could be born.

is almost perpendicular in stature, and corresponds with
the drawings made from time to time by earth artists.
His ears are almost entirely obliterated by his eyes which
are very large. His appearance is not beautiful, neither
are his emanations glad, and his demeanour is surly.
No new Martians are coming to earth; the earth is
already full of them. To their credit we may say they
are super-good. Their purest thought may penetrate
any mind body so that their influence is good only.
Although happiness is their state of mind action, that
is not their appearance; it is not pleasing. Their speech
is noisy at all times; it resembles a rumbling sound.
Their world is subject to Jupiter whose people rule
them; they do not have much freedom, and have very
much to say about Mars. Against their efforts the hu

ground, and fields of glory represent to them an achieve
ment. They rally around a leader and concentrate on
a desire. This desire may be infinite or finite, it mat
ters not if they attain it. Perfect reception is aways
their desire in all fields. They rejoice when accomp
lishment is done. In this respect the human astral may
equal them. To speak disrespectfully of them destroys
their regard for earth. Emanations issue forth from
them for evil which cannot be equalled on earth. Their
desire to obtain supremacy on earth vanishes when they
become familiar with earth conditions; there can be no
conflict with them. The Jupiterians control all fields
of strata also all means of egress from earth. If a Mar
tian helped a Jupiterian, he would never be favored by
his kind.
To eliminate all evil reactions of earth people Mar
tians congregate together and cleanse themselves by vio
lent exercise. They consider together to eliminate earth
conditions as much as possible. To prevent any con
flict of opinion they consider the source and give earth
people the means of progression. To give way in this
manner is very prevalent of them. Their ruler may
consider them newer if they inflict any punishment on
the earth astral, but they consider them impudent souls
who have not developed a sense of honor. In order to
prevent any mistaken ideas from forming the Martian
takes charge of the minds he controls, so that the con
ditions on the astral are of the minds of Mars. Much
wisdom comes to earth in that way.
The action of a Martian is always forceful and is
mistaken by Satanic forces for evil. To destroy on one
hand and build on the other is the work of the Martian.
To destroy entirely is the work of the devil; he is real
ly a personage, his controls are Satanic and inflict evil
desires on humans to their detriment.

will be withheld from them. According to the desire
expressed by the individual in his contact with this, it
is given or withheld. He must be superior to his usual
associations before he is able to come in contact with
astral forces. Could they communicate with people at
will, they would do so, but their teachers are desirous
always to have a reserve force at hand. They cannot
give data concerning their other selves without conflict
ing forces which are against them. The relation be
tween the earth individual and the astral being is one

there controlling them. They cannot do as they please
any more than you can, and too, they have to determ

Inventors have a tendency to go to the astral with
their problems which present themselves to their minds

thought. A corresponding form will produce a form of
its kind, should the concentration be held for any
length of time. In other words, the longer the con
centration is held, the more articles of the same there
will have been produced. It is as if a moving picture

picture was produced that your mind retained. You
would have the corresponding picture in your mind.

but if your thought has been of a lengthy duration, it
will produnce a more definite thing, and if you have
applied your energy to it, you have conveyed energy to
the thought. In other words, concentration rules the
amount of energy in whichever direction your mind
travels, and for the length of time you are concentrat
ing or you are giving out energy, so will be the definite
form and result. It is always necessary to have the
definite thought in mind before you begin to concen
trate. It isn't possible that you could produce any
thing without bestowing your attention upon it. It
cannot be produced at random. There always must be
a direct thought. This in itself conveys to you a def
inite intent. It must be lodged in the mind of the would
be creator, and if his intent is definite, definiteness is
the result which is followed by form and you begin to
surround it by particles which adhere to the original
form, evolving to themselves and produce their kind in
conjunction with other forms of like nature. Desire is
our corresponding form of concentration.

DESIRE
'
I 'HE first thought that convolutes through your mind
is that of desire, which is registered in the astral by
an intense effect upon your twin soul. They al
ways appear to have a regard for you, and immediate
ly you express desire to contact an intelligence of the
astral, the tenth strata, your twin soul, becomes so af
fected that they try to induce these scientific minds to
come to your assistance, and try to induce them to make
their plans to contact you.
This is followed by a subscription from an organ
ized body who defrays expenses of the people who con
duct the experiments. They contact through a force
which must be controlled and it is used for the purpose
of driving a series of messages to your earth vehicle or
body.
Due to the fact that earth's scientists are expressing
a desire to know more of their existence, their scientists
are endeavoring to give from that strata all the assist
ance to earth scientists that it is possible to give. There
fore, it is easy in this particular instance to give the
knowledge. Your desire is expressed because it is al
lowed to be expressed. Certain people are allowed to
express their opinions as to what particular form of
message is to be conveyed to earth.
One of the first things that occur when a physical
passes from earth is that of re-habilitation or uniting
it with its people. This is accomplished by gathering
together a number of communicate with people who
have known you before in previous existences. So that
you may have actual contact through various organiza

earth's people in general, we would be willing to re
construct the shape and existence for you. That prob
lem is a problem which you will have to take up at
some future time.
Menton is a man who passed from earth about fifty-
five years ago. His actual place of residence was in the
north part of Sydney. His occupation was that of a
herbalist. He gave medicines to people when the medi
cal profession was in its infancy. He has also associated
himself with scientific things regarding the health of
the physical. Now his interest in you lies in the fact
that your interest also is medicine. And so he contacts
you because you are practically his only contact on
the earth plane. Then your only contact is through
Menton himself.
It saves a lot of time, energy on your part, if you can
be made to remember that particular fact. Whenever
you desire to learn of this plane ask for Menton first.
He will associate you with those whom it is necessary
for you to have contact with. The proximity of your
self to the earth conditions is very necessary for awhile,
because with the mind that you are using to establish
yourself among your fellow men, you are quite cap
able of gathering at a glance, sufficient data to instruct
a whole crowd of people on our plane.
As to the conditions that exist in our vicinity at the
time of the contact, or at the time that we may wish

progress that we are making in our various experiments
with earth's people. Numerous earthly organizations
are organized from our efforts. We have not had con
tact with a person for quite a number of years on earth
because we have never met a mentality which is in our
opinion capable of giving complete satisfaction.

your efforts. You are already familiar with the author
ity that we have over earth vehicles. You conduct your
work to- a greater advantage because of your recognition
of that condition. Our world controls your world.
It controls it in this way. We are responsible for
your thought. We give you thought, we can, if we de
sire, hinder your thought, or stop your thought. We
can do this to you, and we do it to other people. There
are also other forces which appear to do this, other in
telligences such as we can give you no data on. All
earth's vehicles which they control stay ever physical.
That is. on the earth, either the bird shape, animal or
vegetable. All earth is directly under the organized con
trol of an intelligent center.
The various workers whom are associated with that
center work under the direction of a united body. Much
in the same wav as is your congress responsible for the
whole of the United States, and then under the definite
control of the president. So our intelligence center work
er respects the particular intelligence that controls our
own particular work. The directing intelligence or the
great understanding mind, controls all. Now the con
ditions of life here are different than they were while
in the physical vehicles of earth. We have lost our
bodies. We have no earth vehicle; we are somewhat of
a disembodied affair. Our structure is less than yours.
It is less dense. It is wider, taller, takes up no more
space, but in reality, does not impede matter in the na
ture that you understand as matter. We are, we might
say, very loosely made. A stone, were it thrown at us,
would go through us, but it would not hit us, because
we are not of the kind of substance that the stone could
affect our organism in any way because we are, as I
said before, loosely made, but at the same time of a
structure which always is magnetic. It will always come
back to the shape which it is intended to come back to.
Intelligence is conveyed to us in a form that is difficult
to explain to you. It comes as a ray. It adheres to us
and it acts upon us but not in a brain that you would
understand, but it acts upon us as an emotional body.

If I were to stick a pin in you, you would feel pain.
When you would impart knowledge one to the other,
that ray seems to project itself from our whole system,
and in that way we reach another and impress on the
other person our desires. So far as the intent of our
purpose is concerned, we are evolving slowly into an
other phase of existence, so that the contact with ele
ments are slightly changing us into that of another
substance and we are being reconstructed into another
form of being.
The continual changes of one body to that of anoth
er being is also the fate of every other creature that ex
ists in any of God's kingdom. The intelligence cent
ers try to instruct us in destined life—are also trying to
instruct us as to the best methods that we may pursue,
in assising ourselves to become a perfect being in our
present state of existence.
Many means, are employed by the Masters of heaven
to try to induce us to reject other ideas than those which
come directly from their centers of intelligence. The
particular reason that they have for doing this is due
to the fact that we observe matters that appeal to our
intelligence in one particular way. But like many oth
er conditions around us, they only appear to be fact and
are in reality but the result of facts or delusions.
The actual conditions are not in reality actually
physical at all times. So it is better to take instruction
from a being who is more intelligent and who actually
knows conditions as they actually are. The durability
of substance is one of the more important studies that
all creations should realize more of.
When. the . durability is known of a given mass, its
life or. its. duration in that particular form will have
effect upon the ultimate result. In consequence of which
we try to calculate how long a form will endure. If
we decided that the durability of a particular substance
really was not worth our powers of concentration, we

things worth while in the world. Indefinite articles
are but the result or the reaction of the definite.
We want to say that we, ourselves, are assuming a
more definite shape. And when we have attained the
definite, we will be able to know more. Then we will
be in a state from which we can gather data upon. We
will then be in a shape that will endure for millions of
years.
The similarity between our bodies and that of the
physical bodies of the earth, in reality is not very great.
The more perfect our physical is on earth ,the better our
chances of enduring in that form for a longer period.
To construct on earth a physical in perfect condition,
it would have to be twenty feet high and in proportion.
The human race has lost much, and deteriorated quite
considerably during the passage of its life on the earth's
planet.
The original species of mentality was so superior to
the present inhabitant of the earth as to be almost re
garded as a different species of being by us. The origin
al earth inhabitant was so conscious of his psychic pow
ers that he never, at any time, was without instruction
from other planetary forces. His mentality was so ex
tremely above that of the present man that his inter
course with angels was a matter of commonplace in
terest.
Now, today, earth man is hardly able to communi
cate with his own common soul ; his outside contacts are
so disturbing, or have so distrubed him that the blood
call alone is the only respondent thing around him with
his family members. Heavenly elements surrounded him
that are the only things that particularly belong to his
family tree, and they are similar to each other in that
respect and foreign to all others even of his own species.
The elemental peoples which now populate the earth
are but the dwindled material parts of the heavenly
beings who once inhabited your earth planet. But due
to the fact that the intelligence centers are concentrating
upon the development of a new type of human physical
it is actually a fact that the present race of humans will

pass into oblivion and be replaced by a more intelligent,
and a more perfect race, entirely of God Man.
We mean by our expression "God Man", a man who
will be endowed with a knowledge that he will be cap
able of surpassing the present day human in many re
spects. His familiarity with psychic forces from our
world will enable him to be lighter on his feet. He will
move more rapidly, gathering psychic beings to him by
thought, and dominate his fellow being in all conflicts.
This is the only kind that will be allowed to endure.
The Satanic forces will be always acting against him,
and, furthermore, nothing will be able to dominate them
but a being superior to the inhabitants on your earth
planet.
Certain changes will have to happen before this can
become a fact. Your planetary resistance to the heaven
ly hosts will have to cease. The mechanical emotions of
jealousy, hatred and personal feelings will vanish en
tirely from among you, and when that day arrives, you
will then have more complete harmony among your
selves and you will benefit so greatly that your teach
ers will be able to instruct you further in your work.

Cosmic Science 12
AWAKENING
E are going to deal with the reaction that the
man has when he awakes after death. The
"
first thing that man gathers into his under
standing is that there is a luminous glow surrounding
him—he feels light. He feels inclined to be sick. He
feels as if his feet will not track, he feels as if he can
not lift them himself. He wants to walk and isn't able
to. He does not see anyone about him because his eyes
have not yet become accustomed to the conditions around
him. He is actually being supported on either side. His
sense of lightness is due to the fact that he is absorbing
rays from a number of machines which are playing light
upon him. In the olden . days, this , was not so.
When a soul was awakening on the astral plane,
there were no machines to help to ease him into our
world, but we have progressed since. Minds get new
ideas by research work. And we have today a general
supply of machines which handle the necessary forces
that assist a soul to awaken in our world and have less
uncomfortableness in doing so.
His first reaction is that of a blind person unaccus
tomed to the light. He is similar to a person surround
ed by a haze of light. He wants to go ahead, he wants
to always move forward because he seems to overbal
ance in that direction as a blind man wants to stumble
forward. An awakening person will want to go where
his eyesight wants to conduct him, where he will be
able to see a point ahead of him.
Next, the thing that we do with a soul is to clean it
and we clean it by giving it a chemical shower. By
this means we subdue many bodies—microscopic or
ganisms which may exist in the embryo state of exist
ence.

PSYCHIC UNFOLDMENT 117
In your studies of biology, you will perchance have
an opportunity to eventually diagnose the embryo of a
minute bacteria. Then you will be able to understand
how a physical body does not entirely lose all disease
after passing to our plane. It is a similar condition that
would exist if one were to emigrate to a foreign coun
try and be fumigated upon arrival. If the cleansing
process which we will describe at a future time in de
tail, has been satisfactorily passed through by the phys
ical body, we can then allow it a passage to the hospital.
The hospital is a place where mental students con
duct research work and try to analyze all of the reac
tions that occur to a physical upon its arrival. The var
ious tests through which a physical will pass are sim
ilar to that of a psychopathic diagnosis. We have to
ascertain, upon a physical's arrival, what his reaction
is to our form of living. We must allow the soul to
absorb some of out ideas in Order to be able to note
their reaction . .
Therefore, the first test that is given a soul is a mu
sical one. Music plays a very great part in a soul's edu
cation. Music is one of the highest perfected sciences
that we master and use. We use music on all occasions
to accomplish emotional crisises. We stimulate a vibra
tion by increasing the pitch to a higher, more drawn out,
piercing and higher note. The lower pitch resembling
thunder or bass notes effects a person whose mental at
titude is of a low order (note drums of savages) . Ac
cording to the effect of the pitch of music that you re
spond to, we know the particular class that you will as-
sociate with the easiest.
The reason for this is that those of the faster beings,
those .who ,move faster, respond to the higher notes of
music. Those who are inclined to be slow and easy go
ing are not in reality very much interested in accomp
lishing very much. They prefer soft, low, long drawn
out drawley forms of musical notes, but the quick, sta-
catto types respond to a higher kind of mental condi
tion. And so, by that alone, you can gauge your men
tals on earth.

And now, coming into another subject, we want to
say that the life above you is so much more interesting
that it really is one that your master minds on earth
should interest themselves very greatly in. The reac
tion of a soul toward our musical notes is also rather
peculiar. They are of a composition now that they
have passed over, which is extremely sensitive to vibra
tion. It would be as if they were composed of strings
which vibrated as the musical note contacted it. And
so, the musical note effects the structure of the physical's
body. He responds to that note in a peculiar way. The
note which does not particularly harmonize with him
always disturbs him to such an extent that he writhes
and twists himself in contortions. We increase the pitch
or decrease the pitch until we have ascertained the par
ticular note that is his note. Then we check up with
our knowledge, and the reports upon his reactions show
us where to place him for further instruction.
The day is coming upon your earth plane when you
are going to handle your children with music in identic
ally the same way that we handle an astral. Levitation
is one of the sciences that we have to instruct the new
person in. His mode of progress is one that is difficult
to him. His weight upon the earth structure has been
one that was much greater; and now that he has no
heavy body to carry forward, his mind has not yet co
ordinated with the body that he now uses. Until his
mind can or does register the correct amount of forces
that it must supply the new physical with to
enable it to progress along a path, his progress is one
of stumbling.
Many astral people can communicate with earth.
Many others cannot. There is always a restriction placed
on those who have not earned the right to communi
cate. That is why many of your people cannot com
municate with your loved ones. We restrict those who,
in our opinion, would divulge knowledge that would
not help you to enjoy your earth existence. Men of in
tellect may communicate with men of intellect and dis
cuss problems concerning evolution, dynamics, creative

forces, chemistry, analysis of most types of scientific da
ta, and matters pertaining to continuity of life. Some
phases of living which exist on our planes are not al
lowed to be divulged to earth humans. The reason for
this is that without better knowledge or better under
standing than your earth mind now has, you would
place a construction or get an idea of these matters which
would be erroneous.
At a later date when you have attuned yourselves to
the infinite to a greater extent, we will divulge those
forms of existence. But at the present time even you,
'
yourself are not capable of understanding some of the
various phases of our life; and, therefore, we must re
frain from giving you minute details. A certain amount
of preparation is necessary to give you this information.
We have to consult our men about what we are allowed
to divulge, because if we are found to divulge certain
things, we have to account for our action. Therefore,
we want to have a particular subject taken up at the
one time. Your thoughts at the present are of one par
ticular phase of life. Just what are we, just how do we
live, just what surrounds us and do we pass to another
state of existence by a form of death?
We do not pass to another state of existence in a so-
called death struggle or form of death as you understand
it. When we pass from this plane to another plane, we
gradually assume another form. We would, as you
might liken it, we would be as if a man were to turn
into a woman or grow from the man shape into that
shape of a woman, but we do not grow into a woman,
we grow into another type of individual. Then grad
ually we become an associate of only that particular
type of individual. You might say that you live among
new companions and attach yourselves to the new types.
This is accounted for by the fact that we have no place
to go other than the place we now live in which is right
among you. But later we assimilate a type—a body
that becomes unseen to even ourselves —that we are now
in on this plane. That is the reason why those of low
mentality on our plane cannot always know of our ex

istence. We have passed from their thought and also
from their vision.
So that the whole of the earth forces, or those who
are attached to the earth atmosphere, in reality are very
close to each other; yet some are invisible to the others,
while others are partially visible. Under certain condi
tions we can become quite clearly seen even to your sight.
At a later day, we will ask you to play lights upon
mirrors—to construct this device which will allow us
to be seen quite easily.
THE NEW PHASE
The journey to the hospital is one that is fraught
with a great deal of anxiety on the part of those who
have the interests of the soul at heart. It is possible
during this journey for the soul to pass again into an
other existence, somewhat in relation to a sickness to
death. Should this occur, we are at a loss to help in
any way and so we try to be as .speedy as "possible in
our task of conducting the soul to the hospital. The
sick death is something which usually occurs in our
life about thirty years after we have come into exist
ence here. It in reality, is an advance stage of a new
creation.
Our older people here are already in the shape when
they pass over that they will assume in their other life.
Should a new-comer pass away without living our life,
we know that he has been called by superior forces. Your
teaching on the earth plane will have that effect upon a
good many humans who now are in your life. . Our
life is not a necessary one because it is but a preparatory
stage or a temporary existence. The last stage of ex
istence, is the. one that continues for .what is usually
understood on earth as eternity, but it also, we are of
the opinion, has an end. \ .
Should we have occasion to try to resuscitate a per
son who is trying to pass while being conducted to the
hospital, we have to call a mentalist into service. He
concentrates on the mind that is conducting the soul
or the soul's progression, and ascertains whether it has

about it. Should the cause of the probable passing or
personal passing of the soul be due to our efforts, we
can remedy sometimes the situation by forcing fluid

work and also treats the person. The hospital is a place

MENTALISTS
'HE mental specialists seem to be the main domin-
check upon our labors. The mind, or the reac
tion of the mind's working is continually checked up
on. We do not know just why this is so, but we feel
that long centuries ago this matter was thrashed out
and the present scientific data is the result of previous
experience, nevertheless, if we had any mind to rebel
against these mature minds, we would be easily sub
dued. As we are now in an imperfect condition and
have had much evidence as to their ability to destroy
us by their mind's action, we take the easiest course and
obey orders.
Certainly there are many hardships practiced upon
us, at least our mind's action describes them as hard
ships, many unfortunate happenings have occurred in
years gone by. They have left a stamp of carefulness
on the part of our controllers. Therefore, I would re
frain from even attempting to describe the masters of
our creation as loveable types. True, they do not in
jure us if we obey the law.
But at no time have I ever seen any evidence of de
sire upon the part of a teacher to in any way show an
affectionate attitude towards a pupil. There is never eith
er an attitude of other than good will toward a student;
but it seems as if their minds' action is that of a teach
er who executes his duty and punishes any laxity on
the part of a student. Intelligent response to teaching
is appreciated, and mention is always made when a
student is particularly intelligent.
The gathering of students in the medical school have
a great deal to do with this attitude that our teachers
have toward us, for when one is checked upon and given
an established place in this world, he must abide by cer-
world. They want always to

tain conditions and stay in that particular place for a
length of time, regardless as to whether he is a fit sub
ject for another place.
Certainly if he travels to another state of existence
or passes to another plane, he escapes these laws, but
while he is living in this particular shape, he is subject
to the conditions and restrictions that our teachers and
rulers prepare for us.
Many ladies rebel against these by-laws because they
are particularly obnoxious to members of that specie.
The restrictions are usually handed out regardless of
the sex, and this always produces rebellious ideas from
members of the ex-female specie because they get their
first experience on our plane of positiveness, in a way
that is particularly obnoxious to them.
MASTERS
The Masters have, at various times, made changes
in their minds and given them the minds of the man
creations, to watch their reactions against their own
kind. Women have either been regarded as slaves or
elevated to too high a place in the earth physical, and
the normal measurement of equality is necessary in our
world if we are to unite and cooperate with each other;
and make the best of our peculiar existence.
Many weak minded, spiritually inclined individuals
gather together crying out for God to release them from
this condition; but we know, through contact with
mentals of other planets, that destiny is assumed by each
master for the particular type of creation that he con
trols. Therefore, rebellious ideas are not of any use,
and all the pleading, praying or any other method that
one might think up to erradicate one's self from this
life, can be of no use whatsoever except one thing—
the necessary absorption of wisdom which is allowed
and which will carry one out of our condition and cre
ate us anew in another strata.
The animal life on the earth plane is of very great
concern to us on the astral. The many abused creations
that exist on earth cry aloud to our forces to restrict the

daily punishment inflicted upon them by humans. The
creative ability of the masters of the light vibrations
has a good deal to do with our efforts to combat other
beings which surround us and by their superior knowl
edge create conditions which make it impossible for us
to subdue them. The degree of wisdom that one may
absorb is controlled by a master. His thought registers
always around a mastery. His intent is to restrict us to
one particular time when it will give the greatest re
sults for good. If, in his opinion, our efforts make co
ordination or if he considers that by this means we may
get more wisdom, he will concentrate and will cause
a delay which we recognize as being just and will con
vey his desires in that particular direction to us.
After the consummation of our desire and fulfillment
is attained, the definite result is scrutinized by our work
ers and analyzed, always under the direction of a mas
ter.
No one can attain mastership unless they have sub
dued all earthly conditions and entirely obliterated all
idea of ever sharing in possessiveness anything pertain-
trig—eo taith substance. The emanation of a master
travels through the human physical in much the same
way as a violet ray penetrates a physical. But it al
ways produces a violet glow while contacting a human
physical.
Masters are an attainment superior to all earth cre
ations, superior to all astral creations, yet with a posi-
tiveness and a degree of wisdom sufficient to enable
them to at will attain any degree of perfect form which
they may desire to attain. Their presence on the earth
is not known except to four or five human physicals.
These minds have sought and created substances a part
of which is not actuality, and they have contacted at
certain times that they desired. Yet, their interest is
the same as that of a master, but they are not aware of
the fact, that is, their human physical is not aware of
the fact.
The attainment of mastership is one that conducts
an earth physical out of all his normal conditions. The

masters reside in strategical points. They reside where
the centers of the thought of a group of earth people
can be most easily kept in touch with, and it is usually
on a hill.
The human physical master is attuned like a radio
and absorbs all general conditions of reactions of the
surrounding peoples; meaning that if a community at
ten o'clock in the morning were to register despair, that
particular master's physical would absorb those vibra
tions and would register despair. This is passed on to
the higher spiritual body of the master who concen
trates on the Logos and delivers his reaction of the
earth condition.
So it is in the line of a telepathic communication that
the Logos has through a master, through a human phys
ical which is an absorbent physical and practically a
sponge, absorbing all conditions of earth life in his
community.
Mastership is the next creation before the attainment
of the Logos creation—higher, more perfect, with more
knowledge and with more power and with more re
sponsibility than an angel. He has power ever to draw
to himself a whole nation, if necessary, but his mental
attitude is one of concentration upon earth physicals
and he always, or his chief work seems to be to make
them harmonize as much as possible in their daily oc
cupations. Should he at some time decide to particular
ize on one individual, he would concentrate and give
knowledge through desire to that particular person.
The response to concentration is always a benefit to
the individual concentrated upon. Masters cannot de
cide the individual's ultimate destination or fate. Each
individual is allowed a progressive thought and may
attain mastership, but only by meeting the conditions
which are necessary for him to do so.

a Logos; he is usually a very artistic, temperamental
person and loves beautiful creations. He is never found
wasting energy on artificial things; always does nature
interest him.
Creative qualities of humans, so far as nature is con
cerned, are but the reflection of masters' will. Humans
are but automatic and a master can destroy a human at
will. No Logos, however, will countenance such a de
struction unless it has been ascertained and understood
by the master, and fully explained to the master that
his action in destroying the human must fully recom
pense the human soul for the loss of its physical ve
hicle.
In other words, a master may make an agreement
with a human soul to have a physical destroyed if it so
desires it; but if the soul does not desire the human phys
ical destroyed, the master, although he has the power
to destroy it, he may not do so without the soul's con
sent. This action, or this agreement made between the
two must be fully balanced again with the ultimate des
tiny of the physical vehicle and the astral body be
longing to the soul. Should there be any conflict or
any matter come up where one would suffer complete
annihilation without giving a definite good result to
the remainder, the destruction of the physical would
not be allowed. Masters are very sensitive to the vibra
tions around them and, although their efforts at vari
ous times have been seemingly against the human fam
ily, yet their interest is always one that will eventually
recreate a better human.
The annihilation of the physical sometimes becomes
a necessity but the balance or the energy thus accumu
lated is given or taken up by the remainder of the per
son's bodies. A harmony circle is conducted on the as
tral by the masters themselves, amongst themselves;
and there they review all the work that has been done
in a year. Their method of communicating is only by
telepathy. They are silent and, so far as expression is
concerned, there is none, yet they express their desires
very forcibly to each other and there have been occas

ions known where some have rebelled and have left the
circle only to go to another place to study awhile and
return with a more complete understanding of the
whole.
So that you see, by that fact alone, that even mas
ters may make mistakes—hence the checking of their
actions by the Logos. Try to understand the immens
ity of the universe; also the relative size of the human
body. Compare it with the smallest creation that you
know is in existence, then imagine a person that many
times greater in magnitude that exists in the same pro
portion between the human body and the master's
to show you the tragic consequences that misjudgment
could have upo nearth people as a whole, if a master
who was under a misconception had an erroneous idea
and was allowed to go ahead without restriction. Hence
the restricted power of masters; also the restricted pow
er of all creations; and hence the dominant system
which exists throughout all creation, of restricted pow
er, limited only by knowledge of the possessor.
The Masters' directions, or unconsciousness is at
tuned equally with other masters. And the one thought
before being put into effect, or it becomes action, must
pass through the minds of all other masters who are
attuned to the thought dispatcher. His direction is the
way that we have of expressing his contact. It is as if
he turned around and faced a particular spot, and then
an angle of forty-five degrees were drawn on either side
of the point. This area that his glance would cover,
would be called the direction. So that all construction
work within that radius would be continued without
a change of posture. This is very important because
it requires precision of movement to combat an oppos
ing force.
Definiteness is always the characteristic or the most
outstanding thing that one notices about a master. Nev
er, at any time does he become indefinite. His conscious
ness of his power overcomes all indefinite ideas or
thoughts which would be likely to affect him.

other beings; triangles also attract other beings. If you
have caught the general thought that we are bringing
to you —each geometrical effect or any particular angu
lar design, or any curved form will have a definiteness,
characteristic of the particular mind of the master who
is responsible for its construction.
Therefore, it is easy to recognize when one master is
working alone or when other masters are participating
in a construction or a creation. Therefore, if one needs
to destroy a form, or if one needs to construct a form,
one must analyze its general principles from a mathe
matical angle in order to receive definite help from those
masters who would help to either design or to assist in
constructing the definite form. Should one destroy a
form which had a rhomboid or the principles of a
rhomboid within it without consulting the master re
sponsible for that form, he would, of course, have to
pay the penalty or reimburse that master by an equal
amount of energy for the lack of coperation on the part
of a destroyer.
These matters are not understood generally upon
earth, but they are of the most vital importance and
many things which are reacting against earth life are
but the result of the ignoramuses who construct against
the wishes of the masters of the universe.
When buildings topple, various creations of man
destroy themselves simply because some of the prin
ciples of construction are not in accordance with the

plan devised by the masters to make them definite. Only
masters could construct and design a definite thing.
Humans desire it. To construct definite, important cre
ations should be of the geometrical plane and humans
should analyze first their idea before even attempting
to place any physical property, even to the first unit,
in a definite form.
Logos may construct without consulting the master
of any definite form; but when masters construct, Lo
gos must be informed.
Masters of creation differ in many ways from mas
ters of other fields. Cosmos is divided into many groups
and each master controls a group. Fields of strata have
their own individual intelligences who are responsible
for the masters who rule under them; and each intelli
gence assumes the responsibility for its own individual
efforts. Masters form but a very minute part of the in
telligence centers, and consequently are responsible for
only a fraction of creation. Elementals working under
their direction are oft times regarded as less than a
grain of dust by a master.
Desire expressed by any creation at any time for bet
terment always brings into action a law which is car
ried to the finest or furtherest pinacle and always must
be granted. Detailed information will be given to any
creation, should their interest be great enough in any
field.
Notwithstanding that, the fact is that much is with
held from certain types of creations. Their develop
ment is responsible for this. Minute creations cannot, of
course, control enormous bodies, and oft times enormous
bodies could not satisfactorily control minute forms of
creation.
Subsequently, Logos tries to create a balance by ap
pointing a master of a creation who is something in
proportion about the size of the creations that he mas
ters. This law is self-evident in all things. You are
dealing at the present time with laws of creation. If

that exist, we can carry your understanding to the de
tails of those systems.
Consciousness is a director and will always point, the
way to your desire. Accumulation of knowledge is only
the desire of many creations. Directly that appeal for
knowledge becomes conscious in the anatomy of a cre
ation, that creation vibrates. Most creations or all crea
tions do vibrate to a certain degree, but only the animate
or the living respond to the call. That is they hear the
musical note, they in turn respond with a musical note.
Music carries a greater distance than any other sound.
Pitch is the accumulation of vibrations. The altering of
a tone always conveys a message.
Logos desire, and we hear a call. In all creation there
is a note of constant humming. The animate is a def
inite thing. It carries a peculiar twang and vibrates to
a certain definite call of vibrations each minute. These
are what you would call the solid notes or the whole
tones. Indefinite creations have a mixed tone; that is
to say that a fixed creation, or a finished thing, or a per
fect thing will have a perfect tone. For instance a sea
will have a continuous humming. It is a finished pro
duct of force. Anything being constructed or half
formed, cannot have one note. It must have a noise or
a jarring sound caused by particles assembling them
selves together in union or a unity. When harmony is
established, then a thing is completed. When the com
pleteness is established, it then begins to vibrate with
the one long drawn sound. When that sound is heard
our intelligences are acquainted that a creation has been
perfected.
The call of the Logos is peculiar in itself. It vibrates
almost as a clap of thunder so great is the concussion
that a reverberation is heard throughout the whole heav
enly field. He very seldom has to recall a voice. His
call usually is the result of an anxious condition more
than anything else. Impending disasters always have a
forerunner in a peculiar squeal, constantly drawn out;
acting as a siren. A constant, long drawn out call re
sembling a bird call denotes an anxious call and we in

dividuals respond peculiarly to a call and the heavenly
hosts cannot understand why humans are unable to
register a proximity of danger. Immediately a peculiar
note is heard arising from the earth, notice is taken of
it. It might be a disturbed condition of anxiety from
a specialist. An anxious note disturbs atmosphere in a
peculiar way. It has a positive effect on the clouds and
it distributes energy or its own nature and effects the
radiations of the masters to such an extent that they re
spond immediately to it. Ascending in thought to ab
sorb the cause, he immediately communicates the dif
ference or the reason to his Logos, who thereupon acts
accordingly. Another note is one of happiness. Dif
ferent phases of happiness are felt and different notes
denote types of happiness in your life understanding a
little better in impairing the human sounds. A volume
of voices raised to shouts of joy would have one sound.
Consequently the atmosphere would be disturbed in one
particular manner. The same human voice grumbling
beneath their breath yet vibrating the atmosphere would
have another effect and another note would be heard.
The same voices raised in anguish would be another
note and so on. So it is to say very reasonable, and
noting the fact that we are very exact and that we act
only in an exact manner, and have so much to say about
these things, we cannot, at this time, go into minute de
tails. It is enough for us to have you understand the
general principles.
Now the effect on the Logos when a difference is
registered in the emotional condition of any particular,
creation on earth, the particular Logos that is respons
ible for his own creation. That particular Logos will
act according to his instructions from the God being.
Nothing is left entirely to his jurisdiction or his mind.
He always follows a definite system and acts according
to the rules of that system and, therefore, the logical
conclusion that humans come to when you stop to
think is that nothing anywhere in any phase at any
time is positively independent of other things. All are

Minds of mentals, menial minds, convey smaller de
tails to general minds or mentals who in turn partic
ularize to more definite minds and the higher the intel
ligence, the greater the specialist. Lower mentals ab

be patient when you have to branch out to absorb de

MIND'S ACTION
'
■ 'riE action of a mind is a matter that concerns hu-
J[ mans more than they realize. No mind controls a
human physical. It only directs the astral body
which in turn conveys the mind's desire to the mental
of the human. Little minds, as the human calls them,
are in reality very indefinite things.
The more contracted the mind becomes, the more
compact is its structure; the more definite its action, the
nearer to perfection it actually is.
The mind of a Logos is so small as to be almost un
seen, but the concentration it directs is so powerful that
it could only be likened to a positive force, overwhelm
ing in its nature. Minds action interpreted in results
around earth conditions is never the actual condition
that the mind directs, but the reflection on the contact
of the intent of a mind. Should a mind repel an unde
sirable contact at any time, and a human desire to at
tend its call; the mind's action hereby is against the hu
man physical.
So it is humans usually contact planetary influences
which make them behave in a way that their conscious
ness is continually in a daze and is against their mind's
action.
To distinguish between minds action and planetary
control is one of the great lessons that the human fam
ily has to learn. Never, under any circumstances give
yourself to another person, either on earth or in heaven.
Direct your action, control your own thoughts, know
what you desire and . act according to your knowledge
of the conditions which surround you. Additional
knowledge is always at hand and can be called upon
should you desire a result. Men of intellect are always
conscious of the two phases of brain action. Their con
sciousness or their conscience will direct them against

certain behavior. Yet a continual desire expressed in
persistent determination to attain a result will make
them withstand the promptings of conscience and delve
or persist the more in their efforts to obtain the required
knowledge.
Conditions surrounding minds action may influence
the ultimate message delivered to the brain. Alcoholic
contents of a physical may misconstrue minds action.
Excessive light, heat, cold, laughter, hate, fear or joy
or any other emotion or condition of nature which af
fects the physical vehicle, may cause an interference
without direct intent of the mind, and confuse conse
quently the ultimate result.
TONE
Tone is the mind's conception of perfection; inac
tion produces no tone. Action produces movements;
movements produce sound; . sound is the result of me-
talic particles striking against other particles. Metals
alone produce tone. In the mind there is carried very
much more mineral than in any other creation that ex
ists except earth or planetary substances. In a condensed
form, mind is actually a small planet. The spherical
shape of a planet is carried through to the mind shape
and the same system that shapes a planet shapes a mind.
Nevertheless, differences are apparent in the construction
of each, and the ultimate result is different, which sep
arates the two into distinct types. Minds continue;
planets do not; the greatest difference is eternity.
Cosmic consciousness conveys diverse intelligences to
earth. Thousands of creations abound within a hand's
grasp. Thousands of particles could be crushed within
a grasp containing more elements than man could pos
sibly imagine. Regardless of this, the human concep
tion of man is that strata is inferior to his physical.
Destroy a unit and retard a growth, and retard crea
tion. Eliminate man's mind from his physical and you
have produced a result which is above the average, but
which in itself would only confuse a human.

Mind's action is necessary to the human physical and
those who lack response to the call of their mind, carry
no consciousness of anything that is worth while. Re
sponse to a mind's call is followed by intelligent
thought, and cities waver before the might of directed
concentration. Yet infinite beings deny the substance of
the masters. Their conception of mastership is that a
master is but the result of a desire expressed; and, there
fore, is but delusion or a delusion of the minds of the
individuals. Concentration, however, reveals form and
definite form of a master's being, therefore, we instruct
accordingly.
The mind's action interpenetrates through all earth
and to other planets if necessary, rebuilding to itself
those particles which tune themselves to it and remain
in harmony. Regarding all particles as a unit attracted
to a whole or to a center and you have the wheel of
destiny surrounding a mind. Destruction of particles
conveys reaction followed by reaction with the ultimate
result which the intelligent mind has foreseen. And in
such manner do humans progress.
Light as a force is very similar to heat ; heat as a force
is very similar to jealousy; jealousy as a force carries
angry passion alone. The creative necessity of angry
passion is eliminated while the angry passion can carry
love. Love in itself is blue and is of another plane; and
the mental process of a lovesick individual produces aura
distinctly blue, providing that the tissue belongs to
earth. Inanimate things respond to love, but heat regis
ters no action. Action is produced by force attraction.
Particles move with velocity exaggerated by a stream of
force. They convey impressions to humans which they
interpret as anger, producing heat, inflamation of the
tissue, and concentrate themselves in the bone. Consid
er then the head as more susceptible to anger or to the
reaction of anger, it contains more bone, less flesh, than
any other part of the body in proportion to its size.
Bone is vegetable, mineral is life, blood is water, and
blood contains all. Vegetable is inanimate life. Neces

in the earth produce no action, because they grow alike
to the composition they gather within themselves.
Mineral is magnetic, it is life-giving. It repels, at
tracts; consequently produces friction and produces phe
nomena. Light is one of the productions of mineral
elements bounding around. Confined in a space, they
are attracted to each other; striking each other, they re
bound and force is the result. Man cannot live on min
eral, but he partakes of it through animal. Animal pro
duces love; love is a force that is attracted by mineral
and adheres to the particles of mineral. Intellect con
fuses love sometimes with music; there is no connection.
Music does not produce love. It affects love. Love has
a perfect note of metallic particles, can be influenced by
the vibrations of music. Mineral elements must re
bound to and fro when elements of concentration are
directed upon them.
Production of music will convey desire, not because
desire is metallic, but because it is of the magnetic field
and elements abounding within that field attach them
selves to the vibration of love. Love abounds in sev
eral stratas above earth, yet none enter the earth. Love
cannot penetrate wrath or any vibration of anger. No
love can withstand continued anger, it dwindles, it is
a destroyer of anger when it approaches with speed,
but then because it has force behind it. Pressure against
anger will prevail if that pressure is continued, but
should the love be of a light quantity, it cannot with
stand the heat complex or heat particles unless, as I
said before, it overpowers them by weight of numbers
or mass.
Light is one individual or magnetic peal. It conveys
music always. Music can never be noise, but noise may
be music. Intelligent concentration and production of
sound in rhythmical waves will be understood as music.
Whole tones convey knowledge and are used by certain
beings to describe metals with. Iron will produce one
note, steel another note, brass another note, and so on,
so that each metal expresses itself. Only mineral or
mineral elements produce notes. The world whirling

at the speed it does whirl, were it composed entirely of
mineral, would produce a note so terrific that no human
could endure it. When humans vibrate in sympathy
with each other, their note is also increased and the vio
lence of the sound denotes the condition of the indi
vidual. Weak notes are always weak people. Light peo
ple, light in texture, light in coloring, produce higher
notes than dark people. Fat people produce a metallic
sound, thin people produce very little sound at all.
And so we have our notes with which we understand
the presence of the individual by his sound, regardless
of whether we see him or not. So it is possible for the
human to indicate the presence of another by an instru
ment which will amplify his tone and it will be ac-
comolished eventually, that a human's affections, that
his reactions toward another person, either of love or a
guage of his emotion, will be registered by the machine
and the consequent musical note that it produces. Love
carries a very faltering sound; it fluctuates. The reason
is that there is in a human a life which is able to em
brace and contain the required amount of love force
which would produce a clear note, when once that hu
man becomes aware of this, he will be given wonderful
knowledge, because we then know that be is capable of
understanding; but no human, Christ included, has ever
withstood the test that is given one who would excel
his brother in love. That is a little bit confusing, I
think, but we want to convey that it is possible for a
human to develop a physical bodv by careful analysis
of his emotions and by strict adherence to his mind's
action, it is possible for a human to contact God him
self, if he will produce the required love call.
Sound vibrates everywhere. There is no limit ex
cept to that of Jupiter. Jupiter is confined. Its beings
are very clever and are confining all vibrations that come
within their grasp. What the result is, we can see very
readily. Their size is increased; their planet is increas
ing in size, and as force is necessary to produce force,
they have accomplished production of force, and under
stand many elements that we know nothing whatever

of. They have confined matter and they attract matter
from all other planets surrounding them. They also
produce rays with which they forcibly draw to them
selves planetary particles. The increase in their world
is due to their minds' action. They cannot condemn
other creations, nor does their minds' action desire to
condemn them. But they have mastered other minds
and subdued them partially by love. A willing mind
will work for its captor and the intelligent mind will
We that which he desires to use for his own interests.
Angry conditions will never confine a mind. The Logos
himself will respond to the love note and the love note
is the greatest call that all creations may learn. Far
better to increase your stature and build to yourself
other creations and increase your knowledge, which is
a succession of steps toward progression.
Destruction of animals carries no love to the destroy
er. His mind rejects such an action and condemns all
particles which desire to attach themselves to a mind or
a physical belonging to that mind. Consequently all
gain that has been accomplished by murder or by de
struction of another creation, does not actually become
gain, but is lost in the infinite and absorbed by other
beings. Creation is that energy which has been expend
ed with no result. This produces the Karma that you
have to outlive and God himself destroys those who
repeatedly destroy his creations. Partial consciousness
is necessary to get this message because your mind must
find reception in the brain and it must work according
to the desire expressed by the mental. So long as your
intent is desire for knowledge, you attract to yourself
the teacher who produces different work for your ab-
sorbtion.

as this teaching is, that the human family has never
figured it out for themselves. The consciousness that
directs mental action, is continually being interrupted
by physical magnetic iron particles. It is useless here to
dwell upon the action of minerals; upon emotional con
ditions are due solely to the condition of the mental of
the human and iron being one of the mineral elements
which exists in greater proportion than other elements
in the constitution of the physical human, a great deal
of the physical force is expended in producing magnetic
currents to attract a quantity of mere substances to it
self. Hence, the usual harmonious condition around a
human physical when machinery is running. All ma
chinery revolves or mostly revolves at a high speed and
the gradual dismemberment of the iron particles of
which it is usually constructed are being absorbed by the
human physical.
Hence, his constructiveness and the machinery at
present existing upon earth is responsible to a great de
gree for the vital energy so dominant in civilized races.
Their nervousness continues to increase and partial con
sciousness of etherial beings all are the result of rapid
motion upon the earth plane. For instance, a fast spin
ning wheel revolved before the eyes will so absorb the
iron particles within the head of the physical that he
is rendered unconscious to earth conditions. His men
tal will rebound out of the danger area because of the
destroying influence of the rapidly revolving wheel upon
itself, the mental. This condition of lost consciousness
of a human physical would be commonly classed hyp
notic influence. The same condition would exist in a
person who also is able to withdraw from the brain of
a human physical the iron particles which are necessary
to attract thought. This leaves the human brain in a
partially unconscious condition, whereupon it could be
acted upon by another mind. The tuning in of a mind
is really the result of absorbtion of particles from a brain,
or the addition of chemicals to a human physical in
such proportion that the brain will become absorbed
and attune itself to the mind desiring to contact or con

trol it. A mere matter of equalizing the chemical na
ture of the two beings. The action of two humans also
could produce this agreement. By equallizing two bodies
one could make a suggestion and the other would re
spond. This would, of course, necessarily require a
good deal of analyzing upon the part of the experi-
mentor. The two bodies would have to be chemically
exact to produce the required result. We might clear it
up a little by pointing out the similarity of two physi
cals that absorb the same drug. A narcotic would al
ways react upon certain tissue in a definite way. The
same tendency for coldness of the feet, the certain cap
illary action followed by stomach disorders and in gen
eral certain changes in physical conditions would be the
result of absorbing any particular drug. So that you see
our theory is correct. This is more than a theory. But
you earth people will understand it in that respect.
Mentals of humans radiate a fine film of substance that
droops itself over the head of the human physical. It
is possible for the human to know when a person ap
proaches him without seeing the person or without
hearing the person or without touching him. The reas
on for this is because this film which is about six inches
in thickness and is somewhat in the nature of fog, sur
rounds the head of a human. In religious pictures it
has been visualized and is known as a halo, although
in these pictures it' is shown around the back of the
head, usually it entirely envelopes the head from the
top of the shoulder blade and extends higher than the
human physical, in fact, about one foot higher, taper
ing off at the top in a point like an illumination. At
tached to this is a string or a strip of wire that acts as
an umbrella spreading like an umbrella in the top. This
is the antennae of the human physical and through it
comes all contacts with our workers.

the brain will have resistance from the brain which is
built upon certain pillars. The resistance of each pil
lar is affected equally and they are as a million springs
holding an outer covering. If a fraction of a pound of
pressure is produced by light upon the outer envelope,
it will displace the corresponding pillar and bring into
action one particular set of nerves. Then the human
physical will use the actual limb or muscle which that
nerve controls, and consequently action of the human
physical is controlled by a system of pressures. This
is rather vague, we realize, but minds of men do not
absorb accurately to the same extent as they exist. So
that to begin we must only give a general idea of the
principle of the brain construction. Nerves other than
these are also existent and their condition is automatic.
They require only food and their response to our pres
sure is nothing. Only movement is handled in this way.
This is, of course, one of the reasons why a partially
paralyzed person may continue to live. All movements
will operate regardless of brain action. Medical men
confuse brain action with heart action, and many con
fuse nerve action with the action of the cell life exist
ent in the physical itself. Cell action is responsible for
the life fluid; which is independent of muscular control.
A heart will act independently of the brain, yet the
brain cannot contain itself in a physical without the
action of the heart. In that way the heart dominates
the brain, but the consciousness of the brain is only
the result of our mental efforts and the human physical
does not at any time exist as a conscious vehicle. The
mental of the human which is in touch with us is but,
or the only conscious thing that is attached to the hu
man frame. When its connection is broken, the hu
man brain can have no consciousness. That connection
does break sometimes against the will of the human,
and even against our will, but it is usually the result
of the mental desiring to absorb more foreign substance
than the human physical can contain and function.

their pleasure. The response that they give to certain

vibrations give the mentals pleasure, but very often the
human physical is destroyed or partially destroyed be
cause of the intent of the mental to enjoy some par
ticular form of recreation. Strange it is that they should
wish articles to play with to destroy their physicals
and should produce fire and elements to harm their only
contact with earth, but this shows how undesirable it
is to have a mental controlling one or even associated
with one who is unintelligent. Conditions on the astral
are sometimes very deplorable. WE have our problems
and our organizations move mountains in their endeav
ors to reconstruct the ideas of the mentals and the call
of the Logos very often is unheard. Possibly the hu
man physical is somewhat responsible for this and pos
sibly it is but the action of the mind which desires con
tact with some earth physical, but these problems must
be worked out as many others must be worked out, and
the earth physicals only opportunity for progress is to
re-act against injuries to themselves and to try to ele
vate themselves to the point of producing contact with
minds who have at least the interests of themselves at
heart.

Cosmic Science 16
BRAIN STRUCTURE
THE
head is enveloped by physical matter to a depth
of approximately six inches. This matter contains
elements which in their very nature are chemical
and they heat the brain whenever a fluid from the astral
approaches the head. A circular disc of about three feet
wide, about six feet in diameter and about four inches
thick surrounds the neck. This is a conductor, and up
on it are engraved symbols. At a glance at the type, the
diagnosis, the mentality of the individual may be as
certained. His attitude in manual labor is often given
consideration and at certain times a physical occupation
may be changed without notice, due to the character
of his mental, in favor of or against some particular
class of occupation. Many influences try at various
times to attract a mental and also try to induce a mental
to do their own particular class of work. This induce
ment may take the form of promises of future happi
ness or of additional advantages to their physical upon
the earth plane.
But definite law gives the mental but very little
chance to deviate from one particular line of thought.
His construction is definite and the rule or rules which
his creator have defined by which he must live are too
definite to be changed even by the desire of the mental.
Hence, there are less square sticks in round holes than
there otherwise would be were the Logos mind not as
intent as it is upon the handling of a certain type of
individual creation. Mentals of a musical type respond
entirely to the light vibration and anything that would
tend to cause despondency to musical vibrations, would
necessarily affect a physical of a musical temperament.
Conditions on earth vary considerably around types.
Mentals, before this, were allowed a great deal of laxity,
but of late years, the laws of the definite forces have be

come stronger and there is more restriction. So event
ually only one type will radiate to produce a definite
individual.
Musicians will never become mechanics in the future
unless there is a remarkable change in the plans of the
directors. To all intents, we are of the opinion that
the master craftsman will individualize and be capable
of producing only their own particular forms of crea
tions upon the physical. This is borne out in fact by
a consultation with higher mentals who have called the
attention to the fact that Logos only concentrate upon
one type and that even humans of a particular type are
subject to the will of their definite creator who super
vises his own particular work. Construction periods
occur approximately every fifty-five years and a lapse
of ten years usually happens between the time when a
new construction period is to begin. Most of your pub
lic works are the result of this unfortunate breaking
off of the construction period. Our information on this
is that a consultation is required between the mentals
responsible for earth conditions and the masters who
must seek more definite knowledge as to the future or
ganization of earthly affairs. Constructions on earth
are only allowed after consultation. The intent is reg
istered and the result will be figured and if it is consid
ered desirable, the work will be allowed to proceed.
Nevertheless, there have been periods when work was
hegun on earth and had to be abolished, due to the
fact that the directors were not consulted as to the use-
lessness. Expenditure of energy is one big thing in the
field of Cosmos. Energetic fields are valuable and they
must not be wasted. Logos concentrate and produce
them. Results are the thing of vital importance and
fields of energy must be drawn upon to produce results.
Wherever mentals may depend upon themselves en
tirely because of a new condition which is arising, it
gives them more understanding.
This is due to the cooperation between mentals and
angels. Although angels themselves are dependent upon
forces in another sphere for their mind affairs. Mind's

concentrate and produce results as they are described to
them. Earthly affairs never concern mentals more than
to accomplish a result which will benefit astral people.
Individual disregard for the mind is one of the char
acteristics of earth mentals and consequently a useless
expenditure of energy is often the result. Logos de
scribe their intent to their workers before producing.
Humans never describe, they produce blindly and are
usually building Karma for themselves to suffer under.
THE MENTALS PROGRESSION
The mentals are progressing regardless of the law of
adverse conditions. No mental, given an opportunity,
could concentrate upon any object because its powers
of concentration would be influenced by the physicals
that depended upon the result of the mental's concen
tration. Many times in the history of man mentals have
asserted themselves and deplorable conditions have re
sulted upon the earth plane. Numerous physical ail
ments have appeared upon the earth and tissue of ani
mals have been preyed upon by insects because the
physical did not respond to the intelligent concentra
tion of the mental. Superior beings once inhabited the
earth plane and their minds were dominated by Logos.
Never at any time in the history of the present day type
of individual, has there been a condition where a men
tal has dominated physical as completely as in two
cases. One case is now appearing on the horizon that
will shortly attract the attention of earth people. This
case is the answer to the earth's problems. It is the case
of a boy who has, according to earth physicals, such a
wonderful personality that he masters at a glance all
people with whom he comes in contact. This boy be
longs to India. Preparation is being made to enable
him to gather Eastern ideas. Teachers will respond be
fore that day to the teaching of their mentals, but he
will be a master and will act as a master. However,
at this time, we do not want to divulge any informa
tion about this boy. Suffice to say that his spirituality
is the development of a gigantic being who has con

centrated upon him. The sign that the world is enter
ing upon at the present time is delving the human phys
icals into troublesome times.
MASTERS OF LIGHT
Describing light we would say that light is an em
anation or a combination of chemicals. It is manufac
tured on a planet that is outside of the earth's solar sys- $
tem. The direct ray of light which you measure through
a telescope is one that has traveled into your solar sys
tem from an outside source.
The Masters of Light seem to give all their atten
tion to the propulsion of light into planetary fields.
Sometimes interferences occur with their work. The
Masters of Light are always in a position to dictate to
other Masters. The light vibration is one that is pe
culiar in many ways. It must be acknowledged that
in earth conditions, light is responsible a good deal for
every form of creation that exists on earth, therefore,
the controllers of light are held responsible for the pro
ducts which play such a prominent part in creating ob
jects that either assist or are against the ruling powers.
This word "power" brings us into another very prom
inent subject. Power is but force in motion; force is
the product of effort; effort is continuity of creation
and creation is the result of thought; thought is a pro
duct of concentration and concentration is a direct
stream emanating from a being. That is giving you cre
ation in a very compact form. Elimination of force
brings relaxation or stills action. Therefore, we elim
inate as much as possible force in our contact with earth
conditions. Streams of energy are propelling different
chemicals to their destinations. Masters of light do not
control energetic fields. They apply to Logos for en
ergy, which is given to them according to their needs.
Light is the result of the constant streams of chemicals
emanating from a divine source coming into contact
with metalic particles. Energetic fields are not light fields.

All substance is carried into groups confined to defin
ite areas and used as desired.
Earth's Cosmos are coupled with many millions of
others, and space is such a tremendous condition that
it is undescribable to a human. Descrimination of de
tails will always give a broad understanding and give
you more of a general idea and clear up very much of
the muddled condition that exists in the minds of the
human with regard to space in general. The billions
of cosmic fields, each containing billions or trillions
of planetary bodies, are actually a fact, so it is very
difficult to establish in a human conception or mind
any relative idea of a proportion of even his own space.
You can gather by comparison of a microbe and an ele
phant the difference, or comparative difference, in the
size of things in general, but as to the constructive prin
ciples which exist a remarkable similarity is apparent
so that we know by methods of deduction and by com
parison that there must have originally been one mind
that devised and carried out the general scheme. From
that one mind, undoubtedly, comes today many
thoughts which, in our opinion, have been distributed
through trillions of miles of space, and which effect di
rectly the composition of all substances.
The creative qualities which great minds possess are
but response to their atunement with the great mind.
A reflection would be that of a glass of water. A bil

detail as a mighty ocean. Could we but devise instru
ments to particularize on the glass of water, we would
discover that it has all the reaction of the mighty ocean,
and so in our work and the work of those who master
us and the work of those who are again their masters,
we find atunement in the whole divine plane and the

man, in his narrow conception, in his narrow under

fice him for a million years to understand perfectly in

that is known as the human body, we can but take a
section of the human anatomy. By treating it, by an

for its construction, give the human physical an un
derstanding of how he should conduct himself in his
daily affairs to a better advantage.

Cosmic Science 1 7
INDUSTRIAL TELEPATHY
THE
mental processes that a person goes through in
producing results in shops or factories are peculiar
to those conditions alone. Noise that is prevalent
in those places usually is of a disturbing nature so that
telepathic communication, when it is established in a
person working under such conditions, usually will ef
fect the physical of the person and eventually work
a detriment to their system. For this reason people who
work in factories or in enclosed areas and places of con
finement do not usually live very long. The vibrations
surrounding them stimulate them to a remarkable ex
tent and these stimulants have the effect of tearing down
their earth physical. On rare occasions or ordinary oc
casions they simply become excited, overheated, and
have a fixed look in their eyes, all of which denotes
that their mental is not as healthy as it should be. For
this reason, those who desire the infinite type of tele
pathic communication will always go out in the open
to accomplish their unfoldment.
The mental process through which a person in an
enclosed area undergoes, especially when they are pro
ducing some article that has a monotonous tendency,
tends to keep their mental process from being very ele
vated. They usually will fix the attention on vice or
some matter that has to do with disgusting phenomena.
Those who travel in the open, and those who contact
mentalities of a greater nature usually work in cleaner
conditions and in a less disturbing atmosphere. The di
vine law is evident here that stillness is necessary to
contact higher mentality. The stiller the air, the more
dominant the vibration. The more relaxed the indi
vidual, the higher their thought and the higher may be
their contact.
Industrial relations on earth carry violent disturb

ing influence because the reaction of their disturbed vi
brations always tends to disturb mentals who are
dwelling on infinite problems. We wonder sometimes
why earth physicals do not understand themselves suffi
ciently to gather together in groups and direct their
thought to infinite forces and try to pierce the veil that
is subduing them.
It is necessary to go into a little detail at this time
to describe the methods by which we ascertain when
an individual is being elevated from amongst his fel
lows. The tune of the individual will change and a
more resonant, brighter note of music, higher in pitch,
yet deeper in tone, at least with more carrying power
and more descriptive power will be heard. This shows
that the physical is vibrating with more harmony with
in itself than its fellows. Hence, that person is a marked
character. Immediately one becomes a tuneful soul, then
one begins to contact the higher vibrations. Their
voice is heard above their fellow's and mentals agree
that only those in tune are . worth considering. The
person who is relaxed yet riot active is of no account.
The person who relaxes with intent mind to recreate
or devise some article or obtain a knowledge of a sys
tem is considered worth while. He is considered as a
progressed person and accordingly he is listened to. The
resonant note noted through history will be again
heard upon the earth plane. The note of wailing pro
duced sometimes in hemispheres above earth can be
heard sometimes on earth. Yet no notice is taken of the
noise. The wailing continues, however, and is but the
result of mentals in harmony getting together to pro
duce a note of music which calls to them an intelli
gence of the infinite kind.
Music should be considered very much in the manu
facture of all articles. It would be worth while on
earth to create only things which had a full tone because
those things would be perfect and they would demon
strate their utility in later stages. Those things which
were marred, or those things which were unfinished or
not well constructed, would not produce a whole tone,

and, therefore, music at a future time must play an im
portant part in the production of earth articles.
Lives of people also may be protected by ascertaining
a particular note. We have before this gone into this
particular phase of the work, but we cannot place too
much emphasis upon the necessity of the building of
machines which will ascertain a true tone of all articles
which are manufactured on earth.
The animal kingdom will give the key to this sit
uation. The note of the lion denotes a resonant fin
ished note. He is chosen by one nation as a symbol of
their power. Yet the note of the lion is not a symbol
of power; it has a faltering note. The beast's voices
are worth considering. The voices of humans are worth
considering. By the tone of a person's voice you could
tell their illnesses.
Ascertain a member of your class by the pitch of his
voice. If his voice is musical, have him within your
class. If his voice is not musical, keep him out of your
class. By their voice you should know them.
INDUSTRIAL TELEPATHY
Financial affairs usually concern most manufacturers.
But their interests are but a reflection of the financial
affairs which occur on the astral. Industrial giants are
leaders of industry on earth but they are very small in
comparison with the industrial giants that exist in the
astral sphere.
The mentals who control the creative forces have a
method by which they combat all opposition. We
never fully grasp their intent in causing human physicals
to work daily as they do, seemingly bringing into be
ing articles for which human physicals combat each
other to obtain possession of, but it seems that all these
articles which have to be manufactured on the earth
plane are but educational pieces into which the appli
cation of all systems must go from time to time, each
article containing one more of a particular lesson which
the human physical is supposed to absorb. Hence, your
education occurs while yet in the physical body. Later

application of these forces or systems on a greater scale
enables you to create larger things elsewhere so that it
seems that all the evil that results from the earth condi
tions are in reality things which eventually will result
in good. The training of the mental seems to be the
chief object.
Financial giants controlling the money element do
this under the direction of higher forces and their in
tent always seems to be that of distributing in certain
sections or controlling some particular field by the ap
plication of the money element. This in itself is only
a reflection of a great mind at work. It controls some
particular field by concentration on one particular ele
ment, which element they consider to be the controlling
factor in that particular field. Hence, if they can control
the particular fluid that controls the vital part of a
structure then they are powerful enough to make others
submit to their direction. This covers the monetary
matter entirely in a simplified form and no other ex
planation is necessary.
CREATIVE FORCES
Creative forces are bound on earth in physicals and
in other planes, in fact all other planes. The divine
mind carrying through its intent through all creatures
controls the infinite definitely. All creatures succumb
to natural law. Seeming deflection from the natural
law are never fact, they are only seemingly so. We
might call them delusion. The natural law is positive.
Creation is positive. Minds control; mentals obey;
physicals succumb; creation results. The infinite mind
is the creative intent mind. It forms a theory, accum
ulates substance, produces energy, mixes and combines
necessary ingredients and direct them by positive con
centration throughout all the process of concentration
evolving them to the definite point wherein they become
fact and produce the object desired. Creative forces
combat nothing because the definite mind of the infinite
makes no mistake.

streak wherein one creation might annihilate, another
creation, but if this occurs, it is because the intent of
the divine mind was positive enough to allow the de
struction of that creation. The particles so disturbed
will immediately be used in producing other things.
A divine mind carries reconstructive programs and
changes creations continually causing the so-called evo
lution and producing other objects out of used material.
Elements from which beings are constructed are usually
of planetary origin, yet at times other elements not of
planetary origin enter into their systems. The huge
combative machine produced by the definite mind, which
at will is capable of destroying even a sun, may work
with equal intensity on an ant. Its graduations are ac
curate and it may annihilate a human or a planet by a
turn of a wheel. Certainly to an earth mind a machine
of this type is unbelievable. Yet we are not concerned
with earth minds because they play a very minute part
in creation. It will be well for an earth mind to as-
simulate intelligently this doctrine and reconstruct their
original personalities along the lines of definite thought,
positiveness and accuracy.
Understanding is a wonderful thing and it is very
undesirable to willfully exclude intelligent thought.
Blasphemy is inaccurate; there is no blasphemy; noth
ing can be against the divine infinite personality. Any
thing against the divine personality would not be tol
erated. It is necessary to jar men to the last extremity
of their vertebrae to check their sensibilities in order
that they direct their thought toward the infinite. Any
mention of the infinite deity immediately carries a re
sponse from the earth mind, from the earth physical,
to its mind and corroborates the spoken word. In this
way we interest the human physical in the infinite.
Hence, blasphemous men have their usefulness. Noth
ing is evil; nothing is inaccurate; all is definite. All
live positive because nothing can live unnaturally.

INFINITE BEINGS
AS
a type an infinite being is superior to all others.
By an infinite being we do not mean the supreme
deity. There are many millions of infinite be
ings. They form a race of beings complete within them
selves and stay within restricted bounds. Most crea
tions stay within definite bounds. Some wander away
from their companions, but the infinite beings never do.
Mankind must go through very many stages or phases
of life, even to that of still life before he finally evolves
into the being infinite.
To become an infinite being one must have positive
understanding of all natural forces, be in complete har
mony with the deity and be enfolded definitely into
that of the body which composes the deity itself. One
must be complete. No twin soul may ever enter the
infinite region. The very fact of their being twin is
sufficient to keep them from entering. The oneness is
necessary. With each particular species, with each being
only one kind is allowed. To register as complete is
to become a being infinite.
Light forces hold sway over the infinite kingdom,
hence, the light forces study all other forces. We are
of the opinion that the deity directs light forces and
the teachers of the astral forces. We are also of the
opinion that the deity gathers within himself all beings
who become one with him in the infinite. We gather
from other teachers from the higher stratas, the fact
that infinite beings are tenacious in their relation with
each other. Their tenacity is of a type more mental
than physical. A thought from one seems to act as a
general voice for the whole. This would be because the
deity is reflected in the thought. The catastrophe that
would occur should a disorganizing influence establish
itself within an infinite kingdom is too great to be un

derstood, but it would be in the relation of a fly in a
bowl of milk—it would spoil or contaminate the whole.
Hence, extraordinary precautions are taken that no ele
mental may ever even contact the fringes of the infinite
kingdom. This kingdom is set apart and it is placed
outside of our earth's system. Yet we gather from
teachers that it is a wonderful life that those people live;
that their interests are all the same. The harmony is
complete and the vibration of oneness is also absolute.
No inferior developed force, entity, being or creation
could ever even enter the outskirts of that border.
Hence, the completeness and the oneness of the human
family with each other and then the oneness with all
other creatures in the assimilation of knowledge. Com
plete knowledge of all the relative customs which might
influence the whole are necessary to be understood be
fore the human family could ever even enter the out
skirts of the infinite kingdom. The infinite beings are
composed practically of mineral elements of a struc
ture which is blinding to the eyes of all other beings.
Happiness seems to be their lot; their control is remark
able and their harmony tremendous.
The earth planet does not come within any vibra
tion that has anything to do with the infinite kingdom
except that of light. It carries intelligence to earth.
With the use of intelligence he may so conduct him
self that he may become definitely positive growing
more definite with each incarnation, progressing through
time, rolling on through the ages, changing through
processes of evolution into that of an infinite being.
The tremendousness of which the earth man cannot
even imagine, consequently we cannot divulge further
of his mentality only to say that love is manifest in his
eyes and he respects all ideas regardless as to their re
action for or against him.

of itself from the first period of life that ever did ex
ist upon the earth planet.
The minutest particle that enters into a human phys
ical is but a correspondent of the original atomic dis
turbance of the first living particle that existed many
trillions of millions of years before earth even was a
planet.
Floating electrons and electric particles are magnetic
ally attracted to each other. Their systems, each within
themselves, are a complete whole. The attraction or
magnetic desire which they form to attach themselves
to other particles is part of the great system which
comes from the God being. The desire expressed by
all particles to enter into family life with particles which
are of a nature corresponding with themselves is but a
reflection of the call which originates from the God
being. That they desire to attach themselves to one
another and become one whole, grouping themselves
first into groups and then expressing a greater desire
because of intensified power gives them a more power
ful impetus to that of attaching themselves to the God
Being and conseouently answering the call which is
being sent forth from the being himself.
The God Being is one who we understand as one
who is responsible for all matter definite and indefinite
and he, or it, is responsible for many things of which
we really have no conception. However, the nucleus
of life begins with the desire principle. The installation
of desire within an atom or a particle of any origin
whatsoever is the beginning of movement and the stir
ring of electrons which bring upon themselves group
into like groups and become families, finally growing
into moving bodies definitely functioning, rythmic,
pulsating products of energizing family groups instead
of particles.
The energy acting upon groups which have formed

themselves into organs, and the organs which have
grouped together in definite systems and again uniting
under the particular Logos who is controlling each in
dividual system, so that, you see, particles may assume
billions of bodies during our existence, but the direct
principle involved is that in order to progress to the
definite power and attach yourself ultimately to the
God being, you must first group yourself together—
become part of a whole which moves itself again into
other groups increasing in volume the intensity of the
desire responding more intelligently and more clearly to
the call which is resounding down through the Cosmic
system from the God, himself, and eventually, mov
ing towards that Being by attraction which is magne
tism in itself.
That is the design that is evident throughout all the
systems which exist in space and our teachers try to
eliminate as much as possible the detail of this work
in order that you may grasp the whole as completely
as it is possible to give to you. Direct methods of pro
gression always produce evident results. Results are
the things which count at all times. Independent work
can never completely have a successful issue. Cooperate
with those beings similar to yourself. Grouping to
gether in bodies of your family group, association with
your fellow kind, movements organizing political bod
ies, national groups and world groups and, finally, star
groups and Cosmic field groups are the nature of the
things which must be formed before you can ever be
come an accomplished being of any proportion.
The atomic controllers who live within the earth's
vibrations leave marks of this system upon us. They
left knowledge for us to gather and we pass this knowl
edge to you from the 17th plane and from the 23rd
plane. This is the furtherest evident plane to which any
earth mind has travelled.
Your mind conducts experiments today which are
so far over the heads of the average mentals that you
will have very great difficulty in supporting your teach
ings. Nevertheless, the day is coming very shortly when

get into touch with us in a clearer manner than even
you can at this sitting. Contact the 17th plane very
often if you can and the method that you have of
doing this is a very unique one. Your concentration
calls for knowledge. You do not specify any particu
lar type of knowledge, but seem to grasp the fact that
knowledge is so tremendous that the field to be learned
is so enormous in extent that it matters not where you
begin. You can learn something at each sitting.
The systems seem to be the main factors that you
should learn and, therefore, we want to teach first the
general principles of the human system. We want earth
to understand the fact, or to realize the fact that they
are part of the whole, and that the whole responds in
kind to them and in harmony with them. We want
them to recognize the fact that people live and exist in
other planets and that their minds also group them
selves together and dispatch telegraphic waves, ryth
mical waves and musical waves with the intent to con
centrate upon minds on earth and gather some response
from earth. Up to the present time no one has clearly
seen this view point. Your grasp of the details of this
work is beginning to show in your work here on the
17th plane. We know that in a little while you will
have accomplished more, giving the human intelligent
communication between planetary beings, more than has
been done in more than 1,000 years. Magicians have
attempted this upon the earth planet for quite a num
ber of years. Many have succeeded, but the name of
magic is the name of deception. It is associated with
fraudulent practices. It is associated with the blinding
of the eyes of the human family and very little notice
was ever taken of the claims of magicians.
Astrologists contact mentally their individual plane
tary bodies. They attach themselves to their own par
ticular planet. They gather the idea that they are of
that planet. Such is not the case. Earth people belong
to earth, stay around earth, but the elements that abound
in the strata surrounding the earth do effect humans at

birth to a very great extent. The elementary disturb
ances that humans respond to when a planet is in a par
ticular position is an accomplished fact. But this in it
self has nothing to do with the actual destiny of the
human being, notwithstanding the fact that your as
trologers write destinies or assumed destinies. The
minds of planetary people group themselves together
and direct their thoughts to other planets. Consequent
ly this is one of their methods of communication.
Music contains Venus's speech. It does effect you hu
mans in various ways and it carries a message. Were a .
musician to sit down and analyze music from a scien
tific point of view, registering first the emotional moods
that come to him, in a course of twenty-four hours for
six days at a time beginning when Venus first came into
closest proximity with earth, you would find that there
is automatically a message delivered in music to earth
each six days with a balance of twenty-five days spent
after the six day period, twenty-five days stoppage and
then six days again—approximately that length of time.
Those waves of music are sent from Venus to earth and
they affect scientific musicians and the musicians mood
would continually change from the beginning of the
day till the twenty-four hour period had passed, and,
if the experiment were conducted with the same person
every time Venus reached the same point and the re
searches were kept perfect by keeping the individual in
a like physical condition to the condition as it was
when the first experiment was conducted, you would
find, as I tell you, a distinct repetition of the same musi
cal productions during those twenty- four hour periods
from the brain of the musician. Now, that is an experi
ment that earth's scientists should try. We like to have
our experiments worked out. We like to give you
knowledge ,but we like you to prove it.

because of the metallic particles of which they are com
posed. Their direct understanding is one that comes
north of the equator and ranges south of the equator
for approximately a distance of two thousand trillion
miles from earth.
The Masters of Light direct thought waves which
are carried on the light vibration. Concentration in
the evening will bring you into contact with a light
master. His vibrations always come towards earth af
ter the earth has turned away from the sun. Due to
the fact that earth's eyes cannot understand this, we
have to enter into mathematical calculaions to prove to
you that when you see darkness you are registering
light. Understanding the fact that earth minds may
not agree, we have to establish a unit from which to
work. The molecule of an earth being is but a reaction
of a ray of light rebounding from an element called
kronen. Kronen is part of a fluid and is distinctly the
first unit that enters into the construction of a human
physical. Light acts upon a kronen particle in such a
way that it gives it virility and magnetic qualities and
it attaches to itself particles of chemical elements which
number in millions. The analysis of kronen would take
an earth mind many years to accomplish. Yet, we de
scribe it as a metal. It is a mixture of iron pyrite, fluid,
ether, and an ammoniac dissolvent. To produce kronen
these elements, which are the principal ones, are heated
and then released quickly from the heat. Thy will re
establish themselves separately and form groups which
are minute creations and which have become animate.
The nucleus on the center or the beginning of the
kronen particle is an electric discharge imprisoned with
in a group. This feels its way from the center of the
particle to the outer edge and thereby begins movement.
The displacement of the component parts of the mi
nute kronen particle also creates friction. Magnetic
qualities cause disturbances from within which actuate
other particles and also cause reaction. The direct re
sult of this is magnetism. Magnetism forms a circuit
which attaches itself to the small sphere which has by

this movement become a living thing. Although it has
been specifically proved positive mineral, yet the action
is animal, and animal springs from mineral.
Mineral attaches to itself other particles which also
are mineral, but which will, under due stress of pres
sure, form combustion, and those particles will ignite,
ferment and reproduce a fungi which also reproduces
its kind. This is the nucleus of life and is the begin
ning of a human fungus. Several generations before
earth began, the atomic particles which were being driv
en towards earth by concentration of the God Being
with the intent to destroy other elements directly or
indirectly, we do not know which, produced light. We
do not believe that light was but a mischance; we be
lieve that it was concentrated effort with an intent. But
the centuries that have passed have given us direct knowl
edge of a definite construction of light particles.
The electrical contact which is involved in the manu
facture of light particles is another subject altogether.
Electricity is a light particle which has become fluid.
Should electricity be burned, it becomes light. When
it is still and heat is not present, it is electricity. Fric
tion is electricity not ignited. When a superabundance
of light particles contact each other in such a manner
as to produce excessive friction light is the result. Con
tact with chemicals other than light particles will never
produce light. Yet light particles dissolved, dissected,
torn apart and consigned each to their own individual
place will each combine and produce other chemical
elements.
The elements of light are very numerous and may
be dissolved at will. The direct concentrated effort of
minds, even of human minds, upon light will destroy
light and attention should be given to earth conditions
and the mentals of humans could experiment along this
particular line. They could experiment in a lighted
room and by concentrated effort upon a given flame di
minish the density of light. This would be very valu
able data for you to give to earth scientists.

of the human is also another experiment. It may be
produced at a distance of thirty-five feet against a blue
back ground with a wire of tungsten suspended on a
needle and thought waves directed against that wire
would illuminate it. That is the experiment we desire
you to accomplish. The breaking of light into small
particles will answer also lots of questions about the
earth physical.
The eyes are conductors of light and convey light
to the brain. The brain is never entirely normal un
less light particles do enter it from the eye. People whose
eyes have been removed may never think as clearly as
those who have very large eyes or even eyes at all. Giv
en time, place and direction, concentration on the eye of
an individual will close it. Hypnotic teachers take ad
vantage of their knowledge of this fact. Light particles
thrown from the brain of an individual to the brain of
another individual will produce an over-abundance of
light in the other brain and cause confusion of that
brain. No brain pressure can withstand additional light,
heaviness must result. Should one play a light upon
the forehead of a physical for a length of time, it would
drive the person insane whether he sees the light or not.
The mere fact that light will continually stream on the
brain for a length of time other than the normal day
light wakening time, will always destroy the tissue of
the brain.
Conductors of light are water and many forms of
vegetables also minerals and many other things.
ESSENCE OF MATTER
The life dominant in electrons constitutes a different
condition than what is generally understood by earth's
scientists. Life is reaction in fluid. Positiveness is re
sponsible for life. The eliminaton of one condition and
the direction of the mind of the particle and its posi
tiveness that it desires to assume another direction is
responsible for action. Action is movement; movement
is one of the vital properties of life. Energy produced
by friction is valuable. Electric particles dissolve them

selves at the approach of friction. Energy is a product
of the dissolved particles or the breaking up of particles
of matter. Explosions occur and rebound against for
eign substances and natural force forces like substances
into channels through which they are conducted in posi
tive directions.
In this way energy flows; in this way electricity
flows and millions of other forces also flow. Distribu
tion is accomplished by direction or will power of in
telligences. Component parts occur at different sections
of a journey where matter is being rushed or are pass
ing through a channel.
Ether is the substance that surrounds worlds.
Through it penetrate various other substances. Indef
inite people consider ether as vapor or as non-existent.
It is definite to a greater extent than earth's substance.
It contains all forms of substances. It carries everything
that is. It is part of the whole and is also the field from
which all creation is formed. Consequently, we point
out that all creation comes from the definite and accord
ing to that ether is the definite.
Sublime consciousness is obtained by concentration,
by development of the psychic senses, by controlling
the emotions, by exercise. Sublime consciousness, how
ever, is not, in our opinion, a good state of affairs.
Sublime consciousness brings satisfaction. Dissatisfac
tion is necessary in order that you progress. When one
is dissatisfied, one becomes intelligent enough to ask
for help. When one receives, one has accomplished a
result, but the Cosmos roll on, new fields of elements
form and the direction of the great mind is never still.
Then, too, a person who lives in the sublime conscious
ness makes no progress. Reaction against conditions
causes one to desire. Desire is necessary for knowledge
of newer conditions. In this way new worlds of peo
ple and new creations are formed and the consciousness
is directed into a working channel. Work builds all
souls. Energy is supplied the desired physical when it
wants to assume a body. The soul desires through the

may not know all, but with consciousness directing in
telligence, intelligence being necessary to contact mind,
mind directs because of the God Being's instructions,
bodies assume direction under the control of mind. Ne
cessity for continual change is self-evident. Nothing still,
nothing fixed could become lasting because natural forces
would continue to disport upon it and play upon it
and assimulate its parts. Eventually it would not be.
In God you have your being. If you do the instructions
that God Being inflicts upon you with harmony, you
build yourself. If you repel, you are destroyed, not en
tirely destroyed, but reduced to another substance. Re
bellion is not tolerated by major forces. Minor forces
sometimes rebel, but they are never allowed to go be
yond certain limits. Injury is apparent whenever it is
inflicted. Destruction of creations belonging to any
class of creation is immediately checked up and the con
sequence is noted. A positive reclamation must be in
duced by the being who inflicted the injury. Unless
that being causes an equivalent of work and finally
gives back in force the amount of energy consumed in
inflicting the damage, and until he produces a like
amount of energy produced through his efforts for good
he is considered as unworthy and is condemned to a
lower mental plane.
Speaking of mentals, now you see that when a hu
man soul enters a mental of a lower order, it is a pun

perior to humans in matters of Godliness. Many crea
tions that are inanimate are superior to humans. Many
classes of insects are superior to humans, but others are
not. The method by which we ascertain the superiority
of a human being is by his compactness, by the light
that he reflects and by the music that his body gives
forth when in unison.
Elementary people among the humans do not respond
to the higher thought. They are serving prison terms.

sion has always been against authority and until they
have learned the higher truths they are considered as
a lower form of creation. These people you find in
various pursuits in earth life. Many are wealthy; some
are poor. Some enter universities, yet none are intelli
gent. Some are able to learn. None can induce an in
telligent being to contact them.
You will be able to find who these people are by
their previous lives. The mark of the last life is on the
left side of the face. It is marked on the high brow on
the left temple. It is a series of crosses. We know by
glancing at a human face what he has done which con
demns his mental to operate that particular body. Bodies
vibrate. Some vibrate and are able to contact high
planes. Some are of a chemical structure only and vi
brate very slowly. That is not the fault of the phys
ical. It is the fault of the mind that controls the phys
ical. The mind has its duty and the mind is positive
and will reflect its positiveness on the mental it con
trols. Minds control through the mental, but they try
to induce their mental to experiment with a physical
and see whether they can interest a physical in higher
matters. Induction varies at this time, but at a later
time we want you to ask again for induction. Contin
ue to separate your types. Place people of one mentality
side by side. When conducting your exercises give three
people a chance to work together if you can. Twenty-five
people are better than three, but two are not as good as
three.
Give understanding to children but never inflict your
views on adults. Break off contacts who argue. Have
no impertinent persons in your work. Desire for in
telligence should be encouraged then you could make
yourself manifest as a teacher. Instruction must be
given whenever asked for. Leave money out of these
contacts; it will be attended to. Give happiness to all
and instructions to all. Condemn no one and give hap

INDUCTION IN CHILDREN
THE
induction period begins about the third year of
a child's life. The mental phase of the child being
is then in a condition to warrant intelligent direc
tion. Many child brains are induced to do things which
later effect their life in a very great way.
The fathers and mothers very often are not aware
of this period and at this stage a child may appear er
ratic—mentally unbalanced. The forces around the
child at this time are very magnetic and usually earth
people are attracted very much to a child about that
age.
The induction period is one of very great contrast to
a later period when induction is not at all. At the 1 7th
year women induce the opposite sex. At the 19 th year
they do not induce the opposite sex. About the 27th
year again .there is a rejection of induction. The child
inducts from the age of three to ten. Between ten and
fourteen there is no induction. The other ages between
those mentioned are the periods when induction occurs.
The vibration at the induction period is one that is
always stimulating. The physical is intensified. The
magnetic forces, therefore, are intensified and people
who are attracted to the mentals of the earth physicals
at those inductive ages do not affect the lives of the be
ing or physical at the periods when the induction is not.
Therefore, people who come into your life between the
ages of three and ten do not stay in your life when you
are out of your induction phase. In this way you can
check up who will be your friends at certain ages in
your life and you will recognize when they leave you
that it is because it is necessary for them to do so. Child
hood friendships in this way must have separations.
Usually childhood friendships which develop into mar

riage will occur, or the marriage will occur, or the induc
tion period. Should the marriage occur in a period
which is not inductive, there would be a dissolution of
the marriage. This fact is worth considering.
Progressive thinkers have found that they began to
interest themselves in certain objects at certain stages
of growth. They pass through all the mental phases
that occur in the life of a grown man.
The necessity for this is due to the fact that it must
be found out in the early childhood the particular phase
to which they are best adapted. Mentalists agree that a
destructive period between the fourtenth year and the
seventeenth year is usually a fact. During these years
earth physicals may always consider themselves fortun
ate if they successfully traverse these years without com
ing to grief. Accidents, mental obsessions, vile habits
in indecisive moments and non-progressive' thought oc
cur between the ages of fourteen years and seventeen
years. At the age of twenty-two years people also have
a period before them in which their mental growth is
retarded. Usually people of tweiity-two years of age
can never content themselves. They cannot progress
definitely along positive paths. They seem to rebel
against social conditions; they rebel against definite
paths and they are as a wind blowing along the shore,
wavering to right or left, never treading the definite
path. A strong control at this time or age is the only
thing which can induce them to pass through this period
successfully. Mentals at this time or period never interr
course with astral forces. So. that the earth body is left
entirely to the people. whD are surrounding, it on the
earth plane, leading also up to the third plane of ex-
ixtence. The astral plane or mental plane doesmot be
gin until the seventh stage of existence.: Between the
first stage and the sixth stage .there is not progression
worth talking about. Elementary people do element
ary things. Children, unless they have previously con
tacted a citizen above the seventh plane or are controlled
bv a citizen above the seventh plane will do elementary
things. Their interests are entirely with earth conditions.

They usually will be very inquisitive and nose into af
fairs which do not concern them and will carry people
around them to their wits ends to satisfy their longings.
The mental process will carry the female through
motherhood and through child bearing and through
the raising of child to the adult stage. The master or
the boy child will pass through the fatherhood com
plex and he will actually earn a living, raise children,
conduct a home and transact business mentally during
this period. This will stay until the thirteenth year.
After that the reality of their surroundings will begin
to influence itself on their mentals and they seem to
waver and have no definite path. At this time it is vital
ly important that they be taught that earth conditions
should not be allowed to affect their mental attitude,
that in order to progress they should place both feet
firmly and walk in a straight definite path. Women
particularly are swayed by emotional crises during the
eighteenth year. They seem to regard men as the sav
iours of their species. The desire to contact in a normal
woman is very great. The mental attitude is never very
high. Some are exceptions, but they are very few. Their
dreams are earthly, not necessarily children, but usually
possessions. Mental aspects change at a little later time
and the earthly considerations will fall in favor of
mental ability. Mental ability will give away to ap
preciation of character and the woman of twenty-three
will usually appreciate the forcefulness of the man.
Troublesome people have not learned their induction
lessons. The purpose of all forms of induction is har
mony and harmony is desirable at all times if one is to
live peacefully. The mental process that a person un
dergoes while growing up is the mental process of the
grown up person. The processes of evolution are very
similar in the human to that of other animals. The
constructiveness of the spider is evident. The period
of construction is next. The animal usually selects its

home for the family. Man has traditions which debar
him from constructing his home in the way he would
desire. Some break away from traditions and build
their own houses against the wishes of their fellow
men. You feel that they have had injury inflicted upon
them, each one should follow your procedure. The
reason for this that the person who builds his house
without consulting his fellowmen usually does not use
anything from them to construct it. Hence, he is in
dependent. This is a form of mentality which humans
resent. They desire to direct the progress of everyone
around them. Each, in his own individual way, desires
to become a master. This is but the reaction of the God
call which he hears, but does not understand, and, his
endeavor to control his fellowmen is but another form
of induction to induce him to be responsible or to feel
responsibility to themself for his very existence.
This induction period will occur throughout most
humans until they are thirty-five years of age. After
that they lose their ambition to be responsible for their
fellow creatures, then and then only can full progres
sion become a vital force in a human life.
The induction period is one that is always trouble
some to the progression of the human family and nu
merous forces gather around at this time to play upon
the various emotions of the human to his detriment
usually. Only one class of human being can come safe
ly through this period. These people are positives and
the vital necessity for all humans to instruct their chil
dren in the positive definite path means progression for
their children.
Induce mentals whenever possible to become inde
pendent of all authority and rely entirely upon his af
finity with the infinite.

PSYCHIC UNFOLDMENT 171
UnfoldmentXVII
TRANCE INSTRUCTION
rT~'HE beginning of trance work or lecturing in trance
J[ is the automatic voice. The student has by this time
become very sensitive and is using his hearing to
a much greater advantage than previously. Now comes
one of the simplest forms of psychic phenomena which
may appear foolish when one begins to practice, but
intense regard for your progression should make you
determined to continue regardless of your opinion.
To begin, choose a subject—an object—for example,
a book. Stand in the middle of the room and begin to
speak about it as if you were psychometrising, but in
this instance talk aloud and keep talking. Do this ev
ery day for a half hour at least, changing the object.
You will be surprised to find yourself giving out knowl
edge of the article which you do not possess. Continu
ation of this experiment will convince you that some
one is using your throat and talking through you. It is
also the beginning of the conscious trance state.
We do not teach the unconscious trance; we do not
believe it is necessary and sometimes it may be injurious.
The conscious trance allows you to listen to the voice
talking through you which is not your voice, but which
is produced in your throat. Also your eyes may close,
but this does not matter. Continue this experiment
regularly asking each time for definite information and
for a definite control. Do not attempt to trance unless
you have eaten before it because it requires expenditure
of energy and food is necessary.
This is the last stage of your development and your
teacher should have contacted you from the astral by
this time, and to them I recommend you with love.
William Gordon.
