  		              		Experience Description   

    I was walking my dog and began sneezing. At first, I thought it was normal, but the sneezing was relentless. I felt the need to get back inside. By the time I got to my apartment on the 5th floor, I was still sneezing and starting to itch. My wife was home and I told her that I felt weird. My tongue was swelling and my eyes were red and starting to swell too. My palms were itching, as well as my neck and back. She knew I was having an allergic reaction and went to get Benadryl at the grocery store across the street. Shortly after she left, I started gasping for air and was sweating profusely. I texted her that I needed an ambulance. There happened to be an ambulance out in front of our apartment building and she pleaded with them to let a member of their crew to come to help me. They said they couldn't split up because they were there on another call, but they called for another ambulance. 

  My wife texted me to come to P2 (parking level 2) to meet her and the Paramedics that were on the way. I read the text as my airways  swelled shut and I could no longer breathe. I toppled over from the chair that I was sitting on and experienced my first of 4 deaths that were to follow that night. I went into darkness. Nothing was there; no sound and no light. I wasn’t in this place long because my dog started barking at a high pitch. He knew I was in distress. The frequency pierced my consciousness and I came to.

 I still couldn’t breathe, but I knew I had someplace to go. I staggered to the front door to make my way to the elevator. I didn’t remember to pick up my phone. The elevator was 50-60 feet away. I made it 5 steps outside of my door and was gasping for air. I remember thinking to myself, 'This is how I’m going to go out? Really?' I fell to the floor in the hallway after not being able to breathe and what happened next was life changing.  
  
  As I took my last breath, my eyes closed in death and they opened in a beautiful, radiant, white limitless light. It was crystal clear.   My physical form was no longer a human form.   I was a Light Body.  I could tell because I could see my reflection.   It was like I was looking in a mirror.  I found myself pulled up through the Light at an accelerated rate of speed.   It was like I was being sucked through the air by a powerful, yet gentle and loving force.   It was like I was riding a cosmic elevator.  I wasn’t afraid, though.   All I could feel was love that was so powerful that I knew I was going Home.  

  While continuing at an accelerated speed, I was stopped by my grandparents who came out of the Void.   They were luminous light bodies that I could recognize by their energy. I could feel them.   They were apologetic and wanted to let me know that they were sorry.   Through telepathy, they said that now that they are on the other side, they understand  that by being gay I had live in so much fear. I had to live in terrified silence during my childhood and  didn’t come out until I was 31. By being gay I lived in fear in my own home because my Mom would have beat me or kicked me out of the house. Being gay had a particular stigma associated it because it meant that my sin was unique. I was taught that I was an abomination destined to the Lake of Fire since I grew up as a Southern Baptist in the Bible Belt.  In 2009, I had been  targeted in a hate crime because I was gay, attacked, and left for dead on the street. I understood what my grandparents were telling me. It made me feel good to hear this apology. They said it wasn’t my time, and that I needed to go back.   They radiated love through their energy. I accepted their apology. I said I love you, too, but I have somewhere else to go, as I pointed toward the Light. I affectionately shooed them away. They displayed a sense of humor; almost an arrogance as they honored my wish and moved back into the void.  

  At that moment I looked up and saw my destination.  I was looking in awe at God.  It was like everything was happening at once.   As I was staring up at God in amazement, every gay slur or violent act ever impressed upon me ran through me with such a flow.   Events in my life played back in my mind like a movie.   I felt a deep heaviness as I stared directly at an Almighty, Genderless God. I was  thinking, 'Was this the Lake of Fire moment? Would I be cast into Hell for being an abomination?' With absolute humility, I uttered 7 words, 'I’m gay, will you still love me?'  

  The Brilliant, Loving Light formed into Wings.   At GodSpeed, He whisked me into His vast spiritual arms while huddling up the Universe.   I saw planets, stars, galaxies, and clusters all being brought into a Cosmic God-Hug.   On a human, the place where I was taken would be the Heart. As God brought me in for a Cosmic Hug, He said, 'You are my child. I love you. I love you. I love you. Go tell ‘em.' He said it with a Southern accent. He patted me on the back like a coach encouraging his player to get back in the game.   

At that moment my grandparents ran into the Light and I was dropped back into my body. This explained their sense of humor and slight arrogance. They knew what was going to happen.  

  Being dropped back into my body wasn’t pleasant. I felt my body bounce and I still couldn’t breathe. My blood pressure had plummeted. I was so free on the Other Side and now I was so restricted. I gained enough momentum to make it 25 more steps and I went down again. My wife had been timing me and became concerned that I had not made it down to the P2 floor. She took the stairs and came to the 5th floor. She was running straight down our hallway and looked left at the hallway that led to the elevator. She saw me on the floor and that I was unresponsive. She took control of the situation and carried my dead, limp body the remaining 25 feet to the elevator. My wife is 5’2' and I am 5’10'. During this time I was in total darkness. No God. No Grandparents. No Light. Just darkness. My wife was saying things to me to get me to hold on. There was despair in her voice as she situated us in the elevator. Out of nowhere, I spontaneously awoke in her arms and told her that I loved her and that I was going Home. I fell back on her with my dead, limp body as she was hitting the P2 button on the elevator. She missed the button and the elevator went up. Two men got on the elevator and Malia, my wife, begged for help. One of the men happened to be an Army medic. She explained that I had gone into Anaphylactic Shock and the Paramedics were meeting us on P2.   

  The Army medic laid me on the elevator floor and took control. I have no recollection of the elevator ride until I heard the medic say my name in a loud voice. He said, 'KERRY, I heard you played BASKETBALL.' 'KERRY, I heard you played BASKETBALL!' He placed emphasis on my name, on the word basketball. He had apparently met my wife a few weeks prior to this night and she told him that I was a gifted athlete. I remember waking up to the most beautiful smile from a distance. He was trained to know what to do. If he would have been in my face, I don’t think I would have come back. It would have been frightening.   

  Next, all of these Paramedics rushed into to the elevator and pulled me out. They were unaware of all that I had been through in the last 25 minutes. I was awake and breathing, but my body felt paralyzed. I just felt like a set of eyes in a body that was so heavy and dense. The Paramedics started talking to me and asked me if I could get up on my own. I looked at them like they were crazy. I was still talking telepathically.  I said through telepathy, 'No, I can’t get up on my own! You know where I’ve been and you know how heavy and restricted these bodies are! I can’t move!' They didn’t hear me and I couldn’t speak. They looked at me like I was being difficult and was going to make them pick me up off the floor. After several minutes of me trying to get my bearings of where I was and what had happened, they managed to get me up to the stretcher.   

  I was taken to the emergency room,  treated for Anaphylactic Shock, and released the next morning. Before this night, I had never had an allergic reaction to anything. I hadn’t done anything different this night than other nights. I hadn’t eaten anything that was strange or different. I walked my dog on the same route as every other day.   

  Over the next 20 days, I went into Anaphylactic Shock 6 more times. I had to use an Epi-Pen to save my life. I took 6 more rides in the ambulance to the emergency room. My body was drenched in Epinephrine. My head and my heart felt like they were going to explode. I was being tested at university medical for an answer to why  I had gone into Anaphylactic Shock 7 times in 21 days. Nothing was testing positive for an allergic reaction. To this day they have no idea what caused the Anaphylactic Shock. It hasn’t happened again over the last 3 years. After the NDE, I started losing consciousness at random times and  luckily  these episodes happened when I was at my home. 

  One night, I got up off the couch to go to another room and felt like I was walking in quick sand. I dropped to the floor,  fell into the closet door, and sliced my head open.  I quickly regained consciousness as if nothing happened. I was being treated for Syncope, but they didn’t know what was causing it. This went on for a year and a half before my doctor decided to put a monitor on my Heart. I wore this monitor for 2 weeks straight and it recorded my Heart rhythm. The test results came back showing that my Heart had been stopping for 9 seconds at a time. Consequently,  I needed a Pacemaker immediately. In January of 2017, I had a Pacemaker implanted. The cause for my Heart stopping is unknown. I haven’t experienced any other medical condition since this date.   

  Prior to the Anaphylactic Shock, I was recovering from injuries from a Hate Crime that took place in 2009. I was attacked and brutally assaulted on Sunset Blvd. The perpetrator  left me for dead on the sidewalk and was never caught. I had an Out of Body experience this night, but didn’t Cross Over. I saw my bloody body on the sidewalk. I recognized the body, but was impartial to it. I heard a voice say, 'Call 911' and someone responded, 'Does she have insurance?' Several people were gathered around me. People thought I had been stabbed because there was a pool of blood on my stomach. I was above my body and could see that blood was pouring from my face and the blood was streaming down my arm. My arm was crossed over my stomach where I was laying in a fetal position. I was out of my body for 15-20 minutes. I remember being back in my body when the paramedics were putting me into the ambulance. I looked over to the side and they were spraying my blood off of the pavement with a high-powered hose. My face was shattered. My teeth were knocked out. It took 5 months for the swelling to go down just so they could perform surgery. I had 2 facial reconstructive surgeries over the next 7 months. I developed Frozen Shoulder sustained from the fall in the assault. It took 7 years to recover.  I developed PTSD and it wreaked havoc on my mind and body. Thanksfully, I have fully recovered from this medical nightmare.

Here’s what I looked like on the Other Side as I was going through the tunnel toward the Light.

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 9/2/2015  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Allergic Reaction       Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function)   I went into Anaphylactic Shock. 
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Both pleasant AND distressing  

Did you feel separated from your body?      No    I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   All of my attention/focus/consciousness was placed on each moment of my NDE. It consumed me. My senses were heightened in ways that I didn't even know was possible. I had sensitivities that I didn't know existed.  I could see everything and feel everything. I could hear everything by just knowing.   In my everyday experience, I was pulled in different directions. Life was full of distractions. Do this. Do that. Look here. Go there. My brain was on autopilot.  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         When I was staring into the Light and said 'I'm gay, will you still love me?' This sparked the highest level of consciousness and alertness. Everything sped up. It was as if everything was happening at once, but it all made sense.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     I had conversations with my Grandparents that I've waited my whole life to have. They expressed sorrow, they expressed joy, Happiness, pride, and love. They entertained me. They showed humor. I learned so much during our interaction. I experienced myself in a  spiritual form. I was in the presence of God. I felt an unearthly love. I was able to ask him a question that nearly wrecked my childhood. He responded with an expression of love that could only come from the Creator. All of this happened in 3 minutes.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I could see everything. I could see all around me with no problems. There was a richness and a vibrance to my vision that doesn't exist on the earthly dimension. Not only could I see everything, but I could feel it. The planets and stars were alive. Very different than looking at them through a telescope or in the night sky.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      The way I experienced hearing was an inner knowing of what was being communicated. I didn't hear music or voices. Messages were sent and I received them instantly. I didn't pick up audible sounds.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     My Light Body was in a cylindrical tunnel heading toward a bright Light. It was like I was riding in a Cosmic Elevator at cosmic speed. Outside of the tunnel was absolute darkness. There were no physical barriers, but I could tell it was another area. I felt safe and secure even though I had no control. I felt so much love and joy that I knew I was going Home. The love that I was feeling wasn't an earthly love.  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

  Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes     My 4 grandparents who have all passed away appeared.  I saw Grandmas and Grandpas from both sides of family.  

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   Words will fall short, but it was a brilliant, radiant, limitless, pure White Light that was beckoning me. It was so captivating. It was able to communicate, to give information, and to make you feel indescribable love.  

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     I was in a tunnel heading toward an unearthly Light. There was a void on the outside of the tunnel. At the end of that tunnel, after my Grandparents went back into the void, I was greeted by an unearthly Light. A Light that is beyond words, but made me feel so much love and joy while taking me on a cosmic ride to a Cosmic Hug. The Light was the barrier that I couldn't cross.  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Love/joy/bliss/security/peace/calm/comfort/expansive/free/happy  Just before I asked the question 'I'm gay, will you still love me?' I felt a heaviness. A burdensome feeling.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe     We are all One and everything is an expression of the Creator. We are all a spark finding our way back to the Light.  

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         My past flashed before me, out of my control     Uncertain of the question. I relived feelings of past experiences/events. It was like a gay life review where I experienced what it was like to be a kid again thinking I was going to the Lake of Fire, or Hell. I wasn't made aware of past events that I didn't already know.  

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will.  My grandparents told me that it wasn't my time, and that I needed to go back. I gestured toward the Light and told them 'I have somewhere else to go!' They moved back into the void and the Light revealed itself in all of its Glory. The Light formed as spiritual wings and I was brought in for a Cosmic God-Hug and He said, 'You are my child. I love you. I love you. I love you. Go tell 'em! He said it with a Southern accent and patted me on the back like a coach telling His player to get back in the game. I was dropped back in my body after He patted me on the back with His wing. My grandparents ran into the Light at the same time He patted me.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Other Christian.   At the time of the NDE, I wasn't practicing any religion or spiritual practice, but considered myself a Christian. I was raised as a Southern Baptist in the heart of the Bible Belt in East Tennessee. As a kid, I was taught that being gay was the abominable sin and all gay people would burn in Hell. I hid my sexuality from my family until I was 31 and living in Los Angeles. I never told my grandparents.  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I meditate every day. I read all kinds of books on spirituality. I use Crystals. Anything to enhance my spiritual connection. I talk about death and the after-life a lot, but there is always a positive reason behind it.  

What is your religion now?         Unaffiliated- Nothing in particular- Religious unaffiliated   I meditate everyday. I have a personal relationship with God.  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I believed in my Heart that God was a loving God and that His love would be expressed in miraculous ways. I believed that life continued after death. I didn't believe I was going to Hell like I was taught as a child in the Southern Baptist religion. I never had a good handle on what the after-life was going to be like, or what our spiritual bodies would look like, or how we would communicate. This unfolded beautifully in my NDE. There is no judgement like the religions preach. The only time that I felt anything other than love, bliss, and joy was when I brought the question into the NDE. There was no judgment by God.  

  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I make time for a spiritual practice every day.   I believe in the energy of crystals and Pyramids.  I believe we have access to the Spirit realm while on Earth.  I believe the Veil is thin  

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   My grandparents were luminous, Light Bodies. We communicated via telepathy, energy, frequency, and vibration.   The Light communicated with me. Without question it was the Creator God. He spoke to me telepathically. The Light formed as spiritual wings after I said 'I'm gay, will you still love me?' He huddled up the planets, stars, galaxies, clusters, and brought me into a Cosmic God-Hug. I cry thinking about this moment. I have never experienced so much love.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     After I asked my question 'I'm gay, will you still love me?' He responded with an out of this world Cosmic Journey that brought the Universe in for a Cosmic Hug. I was part of the Universe. The Universe was part of me. We existed together, as One. It was Divine Harmony.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     After my Grandparents told me it wasn't my time and that I needed to go back I insisted on moving up toward the Light. They honored my wish and moved back into the void. They knew what was going to happen, though. As soon as they moved back into the void all of the Light was exposed to me. It was bright, it was brilliant, it was piercing, it was limitless, and it was full of love and joy that is difficult to express in words. I had an absolute awareness that I was in the presence of God.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

  During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I came back with a deep understanding of energy, frequency, and vibration. This level of knowing and understanding didn't exist in my life before. I've become an Artist of Orgone Energy. I create Orgone Pyramids and have a deep understanding of how it works. I am able to share the information with anyone so that they can understand it. I can put it into words and action that makes sense to others. I left my 22 year career in Financial Technology, 2 years after my NDE. I was no longer aligned with that type of work.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     Love is the key. Forgive others. Be in a state of gratitude. Love yourself.  

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     As soon as I took my last breath my eyes closed in death and they immediately opened in a beautiful, white, radiant Light. It was not of this dimension. I was somewhere else and my spirit, knowledge, and awareness was intact. I was a Light Body on another dimension of existence.   I encountered my Grandparents who are alive and well in their Spirit Bodies. They knew all about my life. Things that I never shared with them.   I encountered a Light that is not of this world. It was the Light and Love of God.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     When I transitioned from physical form to a Light Body, it was like layers of life's challenges were peeling away. The density of the human body was falling away and I was pure Light. It was like an onion peeling away its layers.  

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     As vibrational beings many people are operating from a state of fear. Society is stuck in a consciousness of fear.  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     The love that I experienced in the Light was powerful beyond measure. It was unlike any earthly love. It radiated from my grandparents and it radiated from the Light. It was absolute bliss.  

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     I experienced short term memory loss of everyday life situations. I couldn't remember names of people that I had known or worked with for years. I forgot how to use a computer. My work life no longer made sense to me. Using electronics made no sense to me. My entire adult career life has been in the High Tech space in Silicon Valley. I helped to bring the software and digital age to the banking system. This no longer made sense to me and I didn't have a desire to continue doing it. I couldn't retain anything short term. If it didn't have a spiritual or metaphysical slant then I couldn't remember it or talk about it.   Since graduating college in 1994, maybe I had read 5 books. In the 3 years since my NDE, I have read nearly 150 books and counting.  My personality changed. I went from talking about technology most of the time to talking about death, dying, and the after-life.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I lost connection with all of my friends. I was unable to do the social interactions that I used to do. Communication dropped off completely. I was in my own little world trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together. I resigned from my 22 year career in Financial Technology. I dropped all communication with my co-workers. I would read books all day long. I learned about Crystals and how to create Orgone Pyramids. Today, I am an Artist. My relationship with my wife is on thin ice. That part has been sad. I hope it works out. She says I am a totally different person. She's right. I am.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   In the first several months after my NDE, I couldn't find the words to express the vivid memories that were in my head. Every word fell short of what I was trying to convey. I became frustrated with my words so I started to draw my memories. I had never wanted to draw in my entire adult life. I also printed out images that I could find that could help me to visually tell a story. People responded positively when I could show an image of my Light Body going through the tunnel. I could point out where my grandparents came into the scene and how they looked. I have a picture of me on the ground as the paramedics pulled me from the elevator. I tell people that I was dead in this picture, but here's what was happening on the Other Side. Then, I show my Light Body image. This has vastly improved the conversations and my ability to express it.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  i can recall every part of my NDE as if it happened 5 minutes ago. It has been 3 years and it's clear as a crystal. I don't have the same recollection of other experiences that occurred around the same time. I would have to look at my journal or pictures in order to recall many things.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I can see Spirits. I see dead people, but they are never scary. They appear without warning or expectation. I'm at peace with it and want to improve this gift.   I am clairsentient, clairaudient, and claircognizant. Several examples with friends or strangers have confirmed this.   I've been able to Channel messages from a collective energy, a collective consciousness that goes by the name Genesis.   Before the NDE, I worked all the time. I traveled 2 weeks out of every month. The advancement of technology was my life  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Several parts are meaningful. Being greeted by my grandparents was beautiful. They taught me so much about energy, frequency, and vibration during our time together. They healed a gaping childhood wound. The highlight was the way that I was embraced by the Light after I said 'I'm gay, will you still love me?' Words can't describe how loved I felt. The joy was off the charts. What I saw and experienced was otherworldly. The planets and stars wrapped around me in a Cosmic Hug that was initiated by the Light. In my knowing, that Light was God.  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I told my wife in the emergency room as soon as I could talk. It was all I wanted to talk about. I told the emergency room doctor, too. My wife was interested and compassionate. The emergency room doctor didn't seem to care one way or the other. I told my Cognitive Behavioral Therapist that was treating me for PTSD. We talked about it in many of my sessions. She was a Christian fundamentalist. She believed that gay people went to Hell. I didn't care. That didn't stop me from sharing my experience. She asked me why I didn't go to church. I answered 'would you go to a place that condemns you to Hell?' I had a personal relationship with God that didn't condemn or judge. I was still seeing her in June of 2016 when the Orlando (gay) nightclub shooting happened. This unlocked deeper conversations in our sessions. The tragedy seemed to soften her views, while also taking in my personal experience with the church. In 2017, she texted me to say that she was visiting Orlando. While there, she went to the Pulse nightclub and paid tribute. This meant the world to me. 

  When I went back to work, I told anyone that would listen. The reactions were overwhelmingly positive. It brought tears to many. My story is so well documented with pictures, first hand accounts, and writings that no one questioned the validity. Me sharing my story seemed to open it up for people to share their personal stories. One year after my NDE, I was invited to participate in a VR/AR/MR Art Installation in San Francisco. It was called The Art of Dying. People came to the exhibit over a 3 day Halloween weekend in 2016. My exhibit featured an art piece of my Light Body hanging on the wall. Under the picture we placed black and strobe lights that caused my Light Body to change colors. People sat in chairs that had subwoofers attached to them and a 5 min narrative of my experience played on headsets. The person in the chair was taken on a journey. They could feel the words and the experience as it vibrated through the subwoofer. I stood off to the side anonymously. 

  People didn't know that the person whose NDE that they had just listened to and experienced was actually there. That changed when so many people got up from their chairs in tears. When that reaction was noticeable, I was introduced to everyone that came by to experience the exhibit. People hugged me, they cried, they shared stories, they told me to write a book. A grandmother came to me with joyful tears. She told me that her granddaughter is gay and the grandmother is OK with it, but the girl's mother isn't. She said that religion is what's standing in the way of her granddaughter being accepted by her mother. She saw hope in sharing my NDE with her granddaughter and the girl's mother. That made me so happy!   I loved the questions that people would ask. No matter the question, I always seemed to respond with an answer that struck a chord. People are curious about the after-life. People are curious about the paranormal. What I am noticing the most is that people have stories of their own that they have never shared. Stories of their own experiences, or experiences of family members who have died. Many people just haven't felt comfortable in sharing spiritual or paranormal experiences. They're afraid people will think they're crazy. Several people have shared stories with me that they have never told anyone else before. They feel free to share knowing there won't be any judgment or ridicule.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     As soon as I was dropped back into my body and was continuing my trek to the elevator, I knew I had Crossed Over. I knew what I had experienced was as real as the medical experience that was trying to take my life. It would have been impossible for anyone to convince me otherwise. When I share my story it is with confidence and conviction.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     There is no turning back. What I experienced 3 years ago is as fresh in my mind now as it was then. I have improved in my ability to articulate it. I am able to access information in ways that I was unable to before. My entire life has changed as a result of my NDE. I wouldn't trade it for the world.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   I get feelings at times that carry vibrations of love and bliss. I am able to access information that takes me back to my NDE.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         i think I covered everything  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         The only suggestion I have is maybe to add an upload link to be able to share images
