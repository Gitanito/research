	    Experience Description 9687:   

I was born and raised on the South Side of Chicago in the Englewood district. My upbringing in that neighborhood taught me resilience, strength, perseverance and Love. My mom and grandparents on her side were very religious/Baptist so I was very familiar with the religious side of life. However, as I got older I chose my own path. I belonged to a dance group and while in High school I started studying the bible and history familiarizing myself with God and things I never would of considered. After graduating I went to college only to drop out after a semester and eventually had a child. One child turned to 3 and in 2001 I moved to Columbus, Ohio with my family. After arriving things started to become rough and go downhill. A year later I lost my grandmother, the following year my cousin was murdered but I had another child. Every year after things got worse. I started working again for Coca-Cola and after a routine company physical in 2005 I was diagnosed with Lupous. The years following, I was diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety and a lot of traumas dealing with both family losses and custodial cases.

  Around 2012 on a routine checkup, I found out that I had a P.E (Pulmonary Embolism). I began taking medications to try to dissolve them but it was to no avail. With everything going on in my life I was inspired to start meditating. I meditated for several years to try to keep my peace in the midst of everything, but in around 2014-15 I found out that 1 P.E turned to 3. I brushed it off and continued taking care of myself physically and spiritually until I want to say early 2016 I found out I had angina. Again, I kept it moving working, meditating, praying and remaining optimistic.

  On the evening of August 17, 2016 after coming in from work I felt a weird feeling in my chest. I wasn't hurting and didn't know what to make of it so I just carried on with my evening winding down. I began calling my mom, my best friend and my girlfriend before turning in and the next thing I know I'm waking up nearly a week later in the hospital connected to wires, tubes and a breathing machine. The doctors and my family were standing by my bed and said ' Jay, Jay do you know where you are? you're in the hospital. You had a heart attack and died , but you're back with us. I didn't ponder what they were saying I was just at peace and a glowing light surrounding my family. It was what I now knew to be love. 

  The next time I opened my eyes I was looking at my best friend and his family from Chicago and my kids at the foot of my bed and his wife holding my handing instructing me to squeeze her hand if I knew who she was. I did and went back out. When I became more alert they told me what happened. Apparently I drove myself to the hospital, parked my car and as soon as I entered the ER doors. I collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. A code blue was called and they rush to revive me. They got me back  but I again coded and the revived me again. They then inserted a stint into my heart and after stabilizing me flew me to the nearest Trauma Hospital Riverside Methodist. Upon arriving I coded 2 more times and by then they called my family here and in Chicago and informed my mom that someone should come and be with because it wasn't looking good and they will continue working on me. I ended up coding again and then the next time they called my family they were in the car racing here from Chicago and was informed that I didn't make it and I passed away.

  They continued their trip and when they finally made it to the hospital , getting off the elevator they were greeted by a crowded waiting room of people there for me. My mom began saying 'where is he?' My children's mom said to her ' It's too late he's gone. He's been gone all day'. She fell to floor in tears not believing what she had just heard. When they entered my room they saw me connected to wires and tubes and was told to sign some papers so they could officially start the process. My 18 year old daughter said to them as she held my mom's waist, looked up at her and said ' No! he's not gone. He's still in there'. My mom and the doctors said to her' No baby we're so sorry he's not, he's been gone the entire day. She still insisted not to and said 'Just wait another day'. Social media post flooded the social media with my cousin informing everyone that I had passed away, condolences from everyone to the family were coming from everyone. My job being notified of my passing even started the insurance process sending a condolence letter to my family. Which I still have to this day.

  While everything was going on outside, I had no Idea that I was deceased. I thought that maybe I was asleep or something. I had no clue, nevertheless I was at peace. I remember going down an amber tunnel with people reaching out at me from all around it. I didn't feel any maliciousness neither was I afraid. As I got to the end of the tunnel I found myself floating down a gloomy highway at night and even passed a famous landmark in what is called 'The Brewery District' here in Columbus. The next thing I know I immediately shot up to space where I could see from a distance a planet which resembled earth with what looked like a tree with circulating energy extruding from the top of it. I then looked to my let and saw a spiral of stars that looked something like a wormhole. Years later while surfing the web I came across exactly what I saw and it said that it was the Andromeda galaxy. While there I didn't have any form , I was just there observing. I was part of everything and at that moment I knew what it was like when God said 'I AM'. Then to my right I heard someone call my name. I looked but didn't see anything, so I looked again at the planet and the galaxy. Again, I heard my name being called and after that, there was nothing.

  Meanwhile the next morning on August 19th 2016 while memorial plans were being made and my home being cleaned out, they got a call from the hospital saying ' You have to come back up, we found a faint pulse come back up'. Ecstatic and both shocked the family raced back up to the hospital. When they arrived, they were then told ' We can't explain it but we found a faint pulse. Even though we found it he only has a 20 something chance of survival and if he does we don't know what his quality of life will be'. The family shocked and excited told them to continue trying. I was then put in a medically induced coma in order for my organs and body to recover and while in the coma suffered 26 strokes. Nevertheless, I made it through. When I awoke I was felt at peace and the best I've ever felt in my life. No worries, concerns, doubt, anger, nothing ! I was in a state of bliss, calm and peace.  When I became more alert after about a month I was taken off the ventilator and had to relearn how to do everything like walk, talk, write, read etc. It was a lengthy recovery process. 

  I received a number of visitors and was still at peace until I started looking at the television. The more I observed the more saddened I got. I felt all the hate, divisiveness and turmoil going on in the world and it didn't stop there. When I went outside I was aw stricken. It was like I never seen any of these things before. The buses, sky, trees cars, it was all strange to me. After my release I was put back into the world a stranger. I felt like a newborn in a new world. I had to rebuild a new life. In the process I lost my job after nearly 20 years, my home and had to start completely over. Also, with that came an overwhelming ability to feel the emotions of what seemed like everyone in the world. So much sadness, hate and desperation. To this day can be overwhelming. I started back with my meditations only this time sometimes came with visions of events that were to happen. It started with a train derailment I believe on the East coast, then the mass shooting in Vegas a few more then the George Floyd incident a week before it happened. Unfortunately, the latest one was with a Russian invasion months prior. 

  As far as physical ailments, I have developed nerve damage, neuropathy, the lower left side of my body is weak with me not being able to move my foot or toes, TBI ( Traumatic Brain Injury) part of it being damage to my cerebellum. However, I stay optimistic.

I also was told about seeing relatives when you die, but I didn't experience it like I always heard. I realized that when you pass away you relinquish the physical body and form and revert back to your original formless self-contradicting the notion of actually 'seeing' the physical body of loved ones.

Yes     Ability to feel emotions and energy of others not just directly around me , but everywhere and it can be exhausting. I get feelings of hopelessness; I get drained and sometimes feel very saddened about a week or so before a large event happens and sometimes when I meditate for a certain length of time in a dark quiet room I get visions of certain events that had not yet happened anywhere in the world.

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real     Because I just knew and my consciousness acknowledges it. It felt just as natural as breathing  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     Yes    Deep Meditation. Whenever someone ask me about how it was, I tell them that the only time I felt anything close to what I experienced was in meditation and I encourage them to learn it.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       Not at the moment  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?       Not at this moment. Thank you for allowing me to share   



            		Experience Description 9070:   

        On the evening of August 17, 2016, I came home from work after working a long shift. I began feeling strange in my chest but there wasn't really any pain, so I just brushed it off. I made the customary call to a friend of mine and also my mom before going to bed for the night. 

    The next thing I know, I'm waking up in a hospital bed and connected to tubes and machines. I had no idea what had happened or why I was there. I didn't remember anything after the phone calls. When I opened my eyes there was this energy in the place where my family was, which I now recognized as love. As I focused, the nurse asked, 'Do you know what happened to you?' I had no idea, nor was I concerned to as why. The medical staff then told me, 'You had a heart attack! You died.' It didn't dawn on me what was just said until I became more conscious and they went into more detail about what had happened. Apparently, I drove myself to the hospital, parked the car, and as soon as I walked through the Emergency Room doors, I collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. They immediately called a code blue. I was resuscitated  twice until a stint was placed into my heart. They then flew me to the nearest trauma hospital, where they  resuscitate me two more times.  The third time they tried to resuscitate me,  they lost me. In the early morning of August 18th, I had passed away. 
    
    My family in Chicago and my children who were here in Ohio were called and notified of my passing. This was devastating and surprising to everyone. Social media posts became flooded with  expressed sadness and condolences to the family. The word spread like wildfire. My family made their way to Ohio later that evening.  They  met with my children and their mom at the hospital to say their goodbyes and in obvious grief. The doctors began telling the family that they had to sign a release to remove me from the machines. Unfortunately, that horrible task was placed upon my 18 year old daughter. When presented with the papers, she told them, 'NO. He's still in there. He's not gone.' They then said, 'We're so sorry but he's been gone the entire day and there's nothing more that can be done.' But she insisted on keeping the life-support machines on.  They decided to wait until the next day. As my family went to my home that evening and started the process of clearing my home and making memorial plans the next morning, they received a startling and unexpected call from the hospital, 'We found a faint pulse, hurry back up.' Shocked, confused and astounded, they rushed back to the hospital to see what was going on. When my family arrived, they were told that even though a pulse was found, there's still only a 23% chance I would  survive. And if I did  survive, they didn't know what my quality of life would be. As my family anxiously waited for me to, recover another big issue occurred. I had suffered upwards of 20  strokes. I, again, miraculously made it through another challenge. The doctors and the entire hospital were shocked and amazed. One of the doctors started talking to my then girlfriend and said, 'This is impossible, a miracle. How are his organs recovering so fast?' She said, 'His diet. He doesn't drink, smoke and he eats healthy?' The doctor was  so surprised. 
    
    The most interesting thing in this whole ordeal was that I had no idea that I had died. I thought I was just sleeping. While everyone was mourning my passing, I was still experiencing life! I remember being led down an amber-like tunnel and was surrounding by people who were  reaching for me.  I didn't feel afraid. As I made it through the tunnel, I found myself floating down a gloomy highway and nobody was around. I noticed certain landmarks in the city that I was currently living in. Suddenly, I found myself in space and looking at the earth from a distance. I observed an energy protruding from the top of the earth in the likeness of a tree circulating in and out of it. To my left I observed a wormhole and was about to make me towards it. I had no form,  fear, emotions or concerns of anything associated with the physical world. Then I heard someone call my name. I didn't know who it was, but  decided to go towards it. 

    The next thing I know,  I opened my eyes. I  was surprised to see the woman I had been dating several months before. When I looked at her, tears rolled down my face.  I looked at her and even though I couldn't speak, I moved my mouth and asked, 'Will you marry me?' She read my lips and answered, 'Yes!' I felt that everything that was happening was divinely inspired.
    
    I spent a month recovering in the hospital. I didn't have a care, concern, worry or thought about anything. I felt at peace and at rest. I just existed. I felt like a newborn child just observing what was around me. However, everything began to become strange. When they turned the television on and as I watched it, I observed all kinds of activity. I was curious to what I was watching and as soon as the news events started playing, I began to feel really sad. All the hate, murders, talks of wars, and bickering amongst the politicians, I began to ask myself, 'What did I wake up to in this world?' I couldn't sleep anymore; it was as if being awake was normal. I was really a different person. One day, I had a therapist come into my room and say, 'It's time for your therapy.' I was thinking, 'OK, let's do this.' But when  I tried to get up,  I couldn't stand. I had no use of my legs. Again, I was not concerned. I went through various therapies while in the hospital but the realization that I was a different was felt more when I was released from the hospital.
    
    When we left the hospital and  saw outside, it was as if I was seeing these things for the first time. I didn't recognize anything. I saw buses, trees, and clouds, yet they were unfamiliar to me.  It was as if I was  a new person. The next few years were rough for me,  my family, and my fiancée. She nursed me back to health, getting  me to all my therapies and doctors' appointments. Some may think that I came out spotless, but that wasn't the case. I had developed nerve damage on my left side. I had bouts with depression, insomnia, and PTSD. For the first 3 years, I was afraid to go to sleep because I didn't know if I would wake up again. This scared me because  I thought I was sleeping the last time. 

    In the process of recovery, I lost my home, the job I held for nearly 20 years and had to literally start over. On the bright side, I wrote a book. I also started a company in which I am working on creating help for others to maintain mental stability and health through the modality of meditation and aromatherapy. With this second chance on life, I wanted to make it count and if it's the will of God,  it will be done. I have been given a gift and it means nothing if I don't do anything with it. I'm not completely sure of why I chose to come back to the living, but I am sure that to spread love is one of those reasons. Thank you for reading my story.  I hope and pray the best for everyone.

Yes     When I get a feeling of anguish, extreme sadness and this weird feeling a major event happens in the world. The George Floyd incident I saw a day before it happened. The most unfortunate thing is that I constantly feel the hurt of everything that's going on in the world. I feel energies all the time and it's pretty uncomfortable and exhausting.    

    Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          While I was deceased, my nephew back in Chicago called my family. He  told them that he was communicating with me. However, I don't remember the conversation. He told them that I said, 'What about my babies? And to tell them to stop rubbing my arm,' which the nurse was currently doing at the time.    

    Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I shared almost immediately. My brother had a fundraising event for me that December where I shared my experience. The reaction was of listeners being in awe; shocked and amazed. I often shared my experience with many others who inquired or had heard of it. One particular time was when every time I visited a doctor's office, the entire nursing staff heard about me and asked what my experience was  like.  Every reaction from the people I told was that they were awestruck.  One person tole me that  I was brought back for a reason; one woman wanted to touch me because she said that I was a miracle; and quite a few people now believed that there is a life after death and they believe in a higher power.

    What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I just knew it was real.

    What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     Because I will never forget what I experienced. It was not like a dream that I don't remember most of the time, but this was a real feeling    

    Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?   I'm still trying to figure things out, such as my purpose and what do I do next. If there's nothing else that comes from this experience,  I  feel strongly about helping others. 

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         No
