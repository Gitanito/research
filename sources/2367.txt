our nascent knowledge of the unconscious psychic processes,

IT is best to make clear from the start just what the purpose of
this book is. It is
frankly popular :
psychical research enthusi-
asts if any were to read it would find nothing in the
accounts of practical research with which they were not
already familiar; and my philosophical colleagues if it
should come into their hands would be horrified
by the lack
ofprofessional subtlety and refinement in the more theoretical
passages. But the progress of psychical research is not a
matter of interest solely to specialists, who are in any case
already catered for in the Journals and Proceedings of learned
societies. Laymen also are entitled to consideration; and
they are too often provided only with rather sensational
material. The publishers believe that there are people who
for one reason or another would like to have a short, simple,
and sober account ofthe present position in psychical research,
combined with some sort of estimate of the possible future
developments. It seems likely that there is such a public
because so many people even those who pride themselves on
their tough-mindedness will confess to having had at least
one spontaneous apparently telepathic or clairvoyant experi-
ence; and still more have come across stories about the
alleged occurrence to other people ofparanormal phenomena,
stories which were supported by evidence which it was hard
to explain away and by testimony which could not lightly be
discredited. Such things must arouse
curiosity
to learn about
the findings of those who have tried to study these matters
seriously and systematically. Or again, there have been many

INTRODUCTORY
are correct, then it would seem that this work is
going to be of
revolutionary importance, upsetting many of our fundamental
ideas. The present book tries to meet the need of the layman
whose interest has been roused by hints, snippets of informa-
tion, and rumours of excitements to come, and who now
wants to carry the matter a little further.
The novelty of approach claimed in the title consists in
the combination of a resolute, yet not invincible, scepticism
such as is
epitomized in the prefatory quotation from Freud
with a constant awareness of language language in which
we theorize about and through which we view the universe
around us. Though, like the air we breathe, indispensable
and all-pervasive, it is
usually similarly unnoticed. Usually
it is well that this should be so. But sometimes as here
when we have to deal with (and that means apply our language
to) matters which arc radically unfamiliar we need to realize
and remember that it, our conceptual equipment, may prove
inadequate to the new jobs we are setting it to do. When
this happens we need not gloat or lament about the limitations
of finite minds, nor yet become unduly exultant or distressed
by the paradoxes which are the symptoms of such linguistic
breakdowns. If we understand what is
happening,
we can
try to adapt our old concepts or to create new ones (to change
the old uses ofold words or to coin new words with new uses)
in order to cope as calmly as possible with the fresh and un-
familiar facts. The key idea is to think oflanguage and this
for present (but not all) purposes means the descriptive and
explanatory parts and uses ofianguage as a set of conceptual
tools for tackling the world. These tools like all other
behaviour patterns and physical parts ofthe human organism
l
have evolved to meet past needs : to meet new needs they
may have like any other set of tools to be adapted or
supplemented. It is this idea which the other three prefatory
quotations are intended to suggest. By developing its
corollaries and remembering its
implications one can see how
to accept the extraordinary new facts discovered by the
psychical researchers without being paralysed by intellectual

Both because the book is intended to indicate an approach
and because it is meant as a brief introduction to the subject,
no attempt is made to treat anything comprehensively and
exhaustively. Only the main types of phenomena reported
are described and discussed; while it would need a whole
book adequately to develop and defend the ideas about the

ofsurvival outlined in the second halfof Chapter VII

by introducing some new workers into the field and by
helping to blow away some of the clouds of sensationalism
ana mystification which tend to gather over it.
Next we must explain why a book of this kind has two
appendices. These deal with two best-sellers which have
been extremely widely noticed, but scarcely ever discussed
critically except in technical journals. It is now many years
since the first publication of An Adventure by Miss Mooerly
and Miss Jourdain and An Experiment with Time by Mr. J, W.
Dunne. Yet new printings of both books are still needed.
An enormous number ofpeople must at some time either have

easily available critical comment has left the way clear for the
spread of exaggerated estimates both of the evidential value
of the testimony recorded in the former and of the coherence
and significance of the
theory provided by the latter. The
two critical
appendices make a complementary pair of object
lessons : the first, on An Adventure, shows how the facts about
what may or may not have been some kind of paranormal
experience have teen irrecoverably concealed by the sub-
sequent actions of the two vital witnesses ; the second, on An

WHAT IS PSYCHICAL RESEARCH?
Nil tarn difficile est quin quaerendo investigari possit. TERENCE
(There is nothing too difficult to track down by investigation)
THE first recorded piece of psychical research was carried out
under the instructions of King Croesus of Lydia in the middle
of the sixth century B.C. Herodotus tells us that the King,
wishing to test the powers of various oracles, sent embassies
to them, each with instructions to ask its
particular oracle, on
a prearranged day,
"
What is King Croesus, the son of Aly-
attes, now doing?
"
The answers were to be written down
and brought back to him. On the
day appointed the King
"
devised a thing impossible to guess : ne cut in pieces a tor-
toise and a lamb, and himself seethed them together in a
cauldron of brass." When the embassies returned it was dis-
covered that the oracle of Delphi, and that alone, had given
the right answer, recognizably correct, although couched in its
customary cryptic hexameters. This royal research project
deserves the notice it has often been given. But the example
set by King Croesus was not systematically followed for two
and a half millennia. So we can afford to ignore everything
done until the nineteenth century.
From about the middle of that
century various scattered
individuals and groups often people or very considerable
intellectual distinction began to become interested in the
attempt
to investigate the so-called
"
psychic
"
phenomena
scientifically. In 1876 William Barrett, Professor of Physics
at the Royal College of Science in Dublin (later Sir William
Barrett, F.R.S.), submitted a paper to the British Association
about the experiments he had been doing since 1863 on the
possible occurrence of telepathy. Still earlier,

attem£t to investigate the so-called " psychic " phenomena

about the experiments he had Oeen doing since 1863 on the

Edward White Benson (who was later to become Archbishop

Cambrid~e, the Ghost Society, to which he managed to
recruit L1ghtfoot, Westcott, and Hort (of whom the first
6
WHAT IS PSYCHICAL RESEARCH? 7
two were later to become bishops, the third Professor of
Divinity, and all three outstanding New Testament scholars).
Oxford also had its Phasmatological Society, of which
Sir Charles Oman was a
leading
member. But the great
landmark came in 1882, with the formation of the S.P.R.
The initiative was taken by William Barrett, who called a
conference in January of that
year.
This set up a committee
of sixteen which recommenaed that a society be formed.
The Society for Psychical Research was constituted on Febru-
ary 20. Henry Sidgwick, who was the next year appointed
Professor of Moral Philosophy at Cambridge, was elected
the first President. He was re-elected seven times in the next
ten-
years,
and was constantly
interested and engaged in the
work of the
Society
till his death : as also was his wife, who
became Principal ofNewnham College, Cambridge. Among
the original Members and Associates were A. J. Balfour, the
politician,
William Bateson, the geneticist, Leslie Stephen, John
Ruskin, and the Rev. C. L. Dodgson (better known as Lewis
Carroll). In the course of its
history the Society has had a
galaxy ofPresidents andVice-Presidents : WilliamJames, Lord
Rayleigh, O.M., Henri Bergson, and Professor Gilbert Mur-
ray, O.M., to select a few of the most distinguished names.
The objects ofthe Society were set out in the first volume of
the Proceedings. The preamble reads :
It has been widely felt that the present is an opportune
time for making an organized and systematic attempt to in-
vestigate that large group of debatable phenomena designated
by such terms as mesmeric, psychical, and Spiritualistic.
After giving a list of subjects which had been entrusted to
special committees it
goes on to state :
The aim of the Society will be to approach these various
problems without prejudice or prepossession of any kind, and
in the same spirit of exact and unimpassioned inquiry which
has enabled Science to solve so many problems, once not lets
obscure nor less hotly debated.
On the first
page ofthe Constitution there is a very important
note :
Note. To prevent misconception, it is here eanpressly stated
that Membership of this Society does not imply tne acceptance

conference in January of that year. This set up a committee
of sixteen which recommended that a society be formed.
The Society for Psychical Research was constituted on Febru-
ary 20. Henry Sidgwick, who was the next year appointed
Professor of Moral Philosophy at Cambridge, was elected
the first President. He was re-elected seven times in the next
ten years, and was constantly interested and engaged in the
work of the Society till his death : as also was his wife, who
became Principal ofNewnham College, Cambridge. Among
the original Members and Associates were A. J. Balfour, the
politician, William Bateson, the geneticist, Leslie Stephen,John
Ruskin, and the Rev. C. L. Dodgson (better known as Lewis
Carroll). In the course of its history the Society has had a
gala?CY ofPresidents andVice-Presidents: WilliamJames, Lord
Rayleigh, O.M., Henri Bergson, and Professor Gilbert Mur-
ray, O.M., to select a few of the most distinguished names.
The objects ofthe Society were set out in the first volume of
the Proceedings. The preamble reads :
It has been widdy fdt that the present is an opportune
time for making an organized and systematic attempt to in-
vestigate that large group of debatable phenomena designated
by such terms as mesmeric, psychical, and Spiritualistic.
After giving a list of subjects which had been entrusted to
special committees it goes on to state :
The aim of the Society will be to approach these various
problems without prejudice or prepossession of any kind. and
in the same spirit of exact and unimpassioned inquiry which
has enabled Science to solve so many problems, once not less
obscure nor less hotly debated.
On the first page ofthe Constitution there is a very important
note:
Note.-To prevent misconception, it is here expressly stated
that Membership of this Society does not imply the acceptance
8 WHAT IS PSYCHICAL RESEARCH?
of any particular explanation of the phenomena investigated
nor any belief as to the operation, in the physical world, of
forces other than those recognized by Physical Science.
The Society has now been in continuous existence for over
seventy years. It has established extremely high standards
and accomplished an enormous amount of work. To this
must be adaed all that done by similar later foundations in
other countries, and by isolated workers throughout the
world. Also, and so important that it deserves individual
mention, there is now the work inspired by Dr. J. B. Rhine,
at present Professor of Psychology and Director of the Para-
psychology Laboratory at Duke University, North Carolina.
(The word
"
parapsychology
"
means literally beside or be-
yond psychology and, at least in the United States and on the
Continent ofEurope, it is
tending to replace the older
"
psych-
ical research," because it expresses the aspiration of me re-
searchers that their studies, like those of hypnotism in earlier
generations, will one day be accepted into the now academically
respectable society ofofficial psychology, and because it seems
more appropriate as the subject becomes more and more pre-
dominantly experimental.)
Various points require emphasis. First, here and elsewhere
we have drawn attention to the fact that throughout the
history of the subject, men of the greatest intellectual ability
and moral integrity have assisted in investigations: this
personality parade is necessary to emphasize that we are not
dealing merely with charlatanry and silliness.
Second, that psychical research comprises a miscellaneous
family of investigations. Besides the study of mediumship,
telepathy, clairvoyance, and other putative performances that
might be considered as potential subject-matter for psychology ;
there has also been work on water-divining ; representatives
ofthe S.P.R. joined in an investigation offire-waDcing (which
proved, as conclusively as one can hope to prove such a
negative, that there was nothing particularly recherche* or
peculiarly oriental about the capacity to walk uninjured across

But then things often qualify for psychical research precisely
because they apparently do not fit into our familiar categories,
or seem to conflict with accepted ideas : one of its functions
is to provide for the study of what is left over by, or is in-
compatible with the fundamental presuppositions of, the esta-

Third, psychical research is not Spiritualism, though some
well-known researchers, Sir Oliver Lodge and the Rev. C.

that individual human personalities survive bodily death ; and
with its own cult of services and seances deriving from that
doctrine. Psychical research is a science. Or, since

solely with investigation. While there are Spiritualist hymns,
Spiritualist churches, and even Spiritualist heretics, psychical
research in spite of its often bizarre subject-matter belongs
to the world of statistical analysis, self-operating infra-red
cameras, and painstaking systematic study. Yet it is
certainly
true that many ofthe most active early members were interested
in psychical research primarily because they believed that it
might be possible to provide proof of continued individual
existence after death. Sidgwick wrote in a letter to F. W. H.
Myers :
I sometimes feel with somewhat of a profound hope and

And Myers confessed :
From my earliest childhood from my very first recollections
the desire for eternal life has for me immeasurably eclipsed
every other wish or hope (Human Personality, Vol. II, p. 294).
But though many leading psychical researchers have been and
are enormously concerned with the question of survival,
most of the work done, and especially is this true in recent
years, has little or no obvious or direct bearing on this
question.
Fourth, psychical researchers are not as such committed to
maintaining the genuineness of any of the supposed pheno-
mena they investigate : work still has value even if its results
are entirely negative. We have mentioned already the in-
vestigations of water-divining and fire-walking. Another big
piece of work yielding wholly negative results was initiated by
the S.P.R. in its earliest days. In 1884 Madame Blavatsky, the
founder ofthe Theosophical Society, visited England and gave
to the principal workers in the S.P.R. evidence that some
theosopnists in India had produced apparitions of themselves
to other people, and that telekinetic phenomena, such as are
said to happen in the presence of physical mediums, had also
been occurring there. Mr. Richard Hodgson was sent out to
India to investigate on the spot. He spent three months
there, and returned with a most damning report, concluding
that:
I
finally had no doubt whatever that the phenomena connected
with the Theosophical Society were part of a huge fraudulent
system worked by Madame Blavatsky with the assistance of the
Coulombs and several other confederates, and that not a single
genuine phenomenon could be found among them all.
(Proc.
S.P.R., Vol. Ill, p. 210.)
In this conclusion the remainder of the investigating com-
mittee which had earlier circulated, to their later embarrass-
ment, a more or less favourable report now substantially
concurred. Again as we shall see in Chapter V two ofthe
most conclusive papers ever published on the physical
phenomena of mediums have been flatly negative: one,
by Richard Hodgson and S. J. Davey, showed that spirit

so on : but ofthis much more in Chapter IX. Yet to describe
the phenomena in terms which were sufficiently familiar and
yet theoretically
non-committal would involve us in intoler-
able long-windedness. So for the present we shall use the
familiar question-begging terms and the traditional but
unsatisfactory classifications.
Spontaneous mental phenomena provided the main
materials for the most notable monument to the early acti-
vities of the S.P.R. This is the vast two-volume book by
Gurney, Myers, and Podmore rather unhappily entitled
Phantasms ofthe Living. It includes 702 cases which the authors
considered provided
reason to suppose that the mind of one human being has affected
another without speech uttered, or word written, or sign made
has affected it, that is to say, by other means than through the
recognized channels of sense (Vol. I, p. 2).
Of these, the overwhelming majority consist of stories of
people

seeing

visions, dreaming dreams,

hearing
voices, undergoing other appropriate hallucinations, or simply
having hunches about the deaths of other people round
about the time when those people did in fact die: while
the rest are accounts of other apparently telepathic, clair-
voyant, and precognitive phenomena. Most are too long to
quote, but we will give two specimens, taken at random from
among the shorter ones. The first, Case No. 102, comes at
pp. 329-30, and was contributed by Professor Barrett, who
received the account from Mrs. Lincoln in 1875. She wrote :
On the morning of February 7th, 1855, at Mount Pleasant
Square, Dublin, where I lived, I awakened from a troubled
sleep and dream, exclaiming, "John is dead/* My husband
said,
"
Go to sleep, you are dreaming." I did sleep, and again
awoke repeating the same words, and asking him to look at the
watch and tell me what o'clock it was then ; he did so and said
it was two o'clock. I was much impressed by this dream,
and next day went to the city to inquire at his house of business,
Mr. John C. being at Dundrum for the previous month. . . .
When I
got to the house I saw the place closed

and the man
who answered the door told me the reason.

I said.
"

morning," he said. ... I had not heard of Mr. C.'s illness, and
was speaking to him a fortnight previously, when he was com-
plaining of a slight cold, and expected the change of Dundrum
would benefit him, so that he should return to town immediately.
I never saw nor heard of him after, until I dreamt the foregoing.
Mr. Lincoln, her husband, wrote :
I
certify to the correctness of the facts of my wife's awakening
me at the date stated, asking me the time, etc., and to the further
fact of the unexpected death of Mr. C. at the time.
The second, Case No. 274, occurs on pp. 109-10. It came
from Mrs. Stella of Cliieri, Italy, and was dated December 29,
1883 :
On the 22nd of May 1882, 1 was sitting in my room working
with other members of my family, and we were talking of
household matters, when suddenly I heard the voice of my
eldest son calling repeatedly
"
Mamma." I threw down my
work exclaiming,
"
There is Nino," and went downstairs, to
the astonishment of everyone. Now my son was at that time
in London, and had only left home about a fortnight before, for
a two months' tour, so naturally we were all
surprised to think
he had arrived so suddenly. On reaching the hall, no one was
there, and they all
laughed at my imagination. But I
certainly
heard him call, not only once, but three or four times, im-
patiently. I learnt, a few days afterwards, that on that day he
had been taken ill at the house of some friends, and that he had
frequently expressed a wish that I should come and nurse him,
as not speaking English he could not make himself understood.
Mrs. Stella claimed that this was her only experience of an
auditory hallucination. A Frau Clara Schmidt who was
present at the time wrote on February 18, 1884, from Breslau
confirming that Mrs. Stella had behaved as she said she had
behaved ;
and that later they had learnt that Mrs. Stella's son
had been taken ill in London on that day.
It is
only fair to quote one comment made by Gurney in
the
"

(Vol. II, p. 271) :

which I started- to wit, that radical connection between experi-
mental and spontaneous telepathy, the importance ofwhich in my

own view I may best express by saying that I am unable even to
guess what effect the body oftestimony to the latter class ofcases
would have on me were I not convinced of the reality of the
former.
This is a theme we shall develop later.
In 1889 a more systematic inquiry was launched by a
committee of the S.P.R. It worked under the guidance of
Mrs. Sidgwick, who later largely drafted its
report.
The
basis of tms inquiry, known as the Census of Hallucinations,
was this question :
Have you ever, when believing yourself to be completely
awake, had a vivid impression of seeing or being touched by a
living or inanimate object, or of hearing a voice; which
impression, so far as you can discover, was not due to any
physical cause?
Seventeen thousand answers were obtained. Those who
answered
"
Yes
"
were asked for particulars. The answers
were then analysed in detail. Most attention was given to
the cases of death coincidence : that is, hallucinations con-
cerned with recognized people and occurring within twelve
hours of their deaths, the death being of course neither known
to the percipient nor even expected by him at that time. The
idea was to make a statistical assessment of all the answers :
with a view to deciding whether hallucinations concerned
with people's deaths coincided with them more often than
would have been expected if we were dealing with cases of
chance coincidence only; and hence to find out whether it
was necessary to postulate the operation of some new factor
in order to explain the occurrence of these veridical hallu-
cinations. This they believed they had succeeded in proving.
The next landmark was the publication in 1923 of Mrs.
Sidgwick's study ofall the cases ofapparent telepathy between
living persons which had been published in the S.P.R.
Journal since Phantasms of the Living (1886). One case which
she gave in great detail is that ofLieutenant Larkin, who is said
to have seen an apparition of his fellow-officer, Lieutenant
David E. M'Connei, R.A.F., almost at the very moment that
the latter was killed in a crash on December 7, 1918.
M'Connei was eighteen years old. He had been ordered to

own view I may best express by saying that I am unable even to
guess what effect the body oftestimony to the latter class ofcases
would have on me were I not convinced of the reality of the
former.
This is a theme we shall develop later.
In 1889 a more systematic inquiry was launched by a
committee of the S.P.R. It worked under the guidance of
Mrs. Sidgwick, who later largely drafted its report. The
basis of this inquiry, known as the Census of Hallucinations,
was this question :
Have you ever, when believing yourself to be completely
awake, had a vivid impression of seeing or being touched by a
living or inanimate object, or of hearing a voice; which
impression, so far as you can discover, was not due to any
physical cause?
Seventeen thousand answers were obtained. Those who
answered " Yes " were asked for particulars. The answers
were then analysed in detail. Most attention was given to
the cases of death coincidence : that is, hallucinations con-
cerned with recognized people and occurring within twelve
hours oftheir deaths, the death being ofcourse neither known
to the percipient nor even expected by him at that time. The
idea was to make a statistical assessment of all the answers :
with a view to deciding whether hallucinations concerned
with people's deaths coincided with them more often than
would have been expected if we were dealing with cases of
chance coincidence only; and hence to find out whether it
was necessary to postulate the operation of some new factor
in order to explain the occurrence of these veridical hallu-
cinations. This they believed they had succeeded in proving.
The next landmark was the publication in 1923 of Mrs.
Sidgwick'sstudy ofall the cases ofapparent telepathy between
living persons which had been published in the S.P.R.
Journal since Phantasms ofthe Living (r886). One case which
she gave in great detail is that ofLieutenant Larkin, who is said
to have seen an apparition of his fellow-officer, Lieutenant
David E. M'Connel, R.A.F., almost at the very moment that
the latter was killed in a crash on December 7, 1918.
M'Connel was eighteen years old. He had been ordered to
16 SPONTANEOUS PHENOMENA! MENTAL
fly a Camel to Tadcaster from Scampton, and was accom-
panied by an Avro two-seater, in which he was to have been
brought back to Scampton after he had delivered the
Camel there. The two machines ran into dense fog.
The pilot of the Avro made a successful forced landing, but
M'Connel flew on. He crashed about a quarter of a mile
from Tadcaster aerodrome. The first on the scene was a girl
who had watched the crash and who
"
found the officer
dead." His watch registered 3.25 and had apparently been
stopped by the impact. Meanwhile Lieutenant Larkin, at the
aerodrome at Scampton, was smoking and reading by the fire.
Some time between 3.20 and 3.30 p.m. (according to the
written account which he gave to M'Connel's father and which
the latter included when he first sent the case to Sir Oliver
Lodge) he heard a familiar clatter approaching and M'Connel's
voice calling out
"
Hello, boy !
"
He turned in his chair and
saw M'Connel standing halfin and halfout ofthe room, hold-
ing the knob of the door. He said he had had a good trip,
and went out, closing the door. At 3.45 p.m. Lieutenant
Garner-Smith came in and said,
"
I
hope Mac gets back early."
Larkin told him he had already arrived. When, that evening,
Larkin learned that M'Connel had been killed, he could not at
first believe it. Garner-Smith wrote a corroborative state-
ment. M'Connel died on December 7. Lieutenant R.
Mowat Hillman signed a statement to the effect that Larkin
told him the story exactly as he later wrote it down on Sunday,
December 8, the day after the incident was supposed to have
taken place. Larkin's statement itself is dated December 22.
M'Connel's father wrote to Sir Oliver Lodge, enclosing this
statement, on January 16. In his letter he says that he first
heard of the incident at his son's funeral, on December n,
and that he wrote to ask Larkin about it as soon as he could.
We have given this case in some detail because it is one of the
very best of its kind in the Society's collection : for the first
written record by Larkin was made only a fortnight after the
alleged occurrence, and the corroborative records not so
much later in striking contrast with most of the material in
Phantasms ofthe Living.

are supposed to have occurred while he was still an under-
graduate at Oxford; before he joined the staff of the Daily
Mirror. The present writer was up at Oxford at the same
time, and can vouch for the fact that the business made quite
a stir there and then. Godley's
story is that he had four
dreams of winners, all of which came true. Three of the
forecasts were well substantiated ; and in fact good winnings
were made by people backing them. Godley declared that
these were his only dreams of this kind. We have of course
only his word for this ; indeed, we have only his word for the
fact that any dreams occurred at all. But, granting these
points, the case is still
arguable. Godley was a keen student of
form, and may well have picked up tips which then came out
in the shape of dreams. A fifth dream, sent to the Society
some months later, was not fulfilled.
Though there are frequent references in the literature to the
quality of the spontaneous cases collected by the S.P.R., this
is a matter on which estimates seem to be highly Subjective.
Dr. D. J. West when he was Research Officer of the S.P.R.
reviewed the material and concluded that

Living, Case No. 685 (Vol. II, pp.
671-5), which was published with the usual collection of
confirmatory evidence, was later revealed by the confession
of one of me participants to have been entirely fraudulent.

very small.

plays tricks. And especially when, consciously or uncon-

congenial facts: and to "remember" things more as we
would wish them to have been than as in fact they were.
This is
why Darwin trained himself to make immediate notes
when he met facts apparently recalcitrant to his theories : he
knew that otherwise they would too easily slip

enjoy a good

narrator is a person of the very greatest integrity who may be
entirely unaware that art is
improving history.
This notorious unreliability of unaided memory, especially
where powerful interests and emotions are involved, makes it
essential to have written records made as soon as possible after
a supposedly "psychic" incident has occurred if we are to
be confident that the account is reliable. But this demand is

thus qualified there is
usually no particular reason why it
should be recorded. But after an unrecorded supposed experi-

inevitably suspect. Particularly in the case of

quite possible though impossible decisively to
prove in any given case that no dream occurred at all : the

may have been a case of the common

members a previous experience, which one has not in fact
had.
Now suppose that this hurdle is overcome. Granted that
we obtain a set of cases impressively reported and docu-
mented :
suppose each experience was recorded, and the
record witnessed and secured against later tampering, as soon
as possible after it occurred and before the verification was
available; and suppose the occurrence and nature of the
verification were established equally firmly. Difficulties
would by no means be over. To have made sure that the
facts were indeed such-and-such is
only to have passed a
qualifying, not a final, examination. It still has to be shown
both that the facts are significant and that they cannot be
normally explained.
In this context to say that certain facts are significant is to
say that they cannot be dismissed as the product of mere
coincidence, and consequently requiring no explanation.
The point in question comes out well from an old Greek story.
It was a Greet custom a similar practice is still found today
among Roman Catholics in times of trouble to call upon
some god for help, vowing if the help was forthcoming to
make some return in the shape of an offering or commemora-
tive tablet. Once upon a time a celebrated Greek atheist was
being shown round a temple and the priest rebuked his
scepticism by pointing to the accumulation of votive offer-
ings from sailors whom the god had preserved from ship-
wreck. He replied with the question

paranormal factor of telepathy or precognition until and
unless we can be sure that the proportion of such veridical

substantially larger than

publishing most of the (already preselected) cases it receives.
Of course, investigators have tried hard to overcome such
objections. This was the main purpose of the Census of
Hallucinations, mentioned above. The report made an heroic
attempt to apply statistical methods to this recalcitrant, because
so very varied, material. Having collected all the answers
to their question, the authors
analysed
the replies of those
who said they had had non-veridical (i.e.
not even apparently
paranormal) hallucinations. These showed a remarkable
preponderance of recent cases. Since there was no reason to
suppose that hallucinations were really becoming more fre-
quent, the obvious explanation was that non-veridical cases
were quickly forgotten. The exact opposite was the case
with me claims to veridical hallucinations. The census
collection of alleged death coincidences contained a dispro-
portionately large number of remote cases ; which suggested
that imagination had often assisted to improve memory.
The censors claimed that when all due allowance had been
made for distorting factors, the findings were still
positive.

that there is a paranormal factor at work. To do this,
the possibility of normal explanation also has to be excluded.
By this stage the most likely normal explanation is un-
conscious knowledge, inferences, or speculation. It is
notoriously difficult to prove any negative ;
and almost im-
possible to prove that dreams, hunches, and hallucinations
were not the product of unconscious observation and ratio-
cination. (And, incidentally, almost equally difficult to
prove that they were.) In the M'Connel case Larkin knew
that his friend had gone out on a flight. He must have
known that the weather was bad. He might have known
that the companion machine had made a forced landing. He
was sitting smoking and reading by the fire, probably dozing.

me most remarkable incidents in their previous life on which
they
based a belief in mysterious occult influences. Events
sucn as accidents or illnesses of near relatives, in particular the
death of one of the parents, have often enough happened
during the treatment and interrupted it ; but not on one single
occasion did these occurrences, eminently suitable as they were,
afford me the occasion of registering a single telepathic dream,

We are not trying to prove, or even to hint, that no spon-

factor : but only to show the sort of cases which have been
collected and studied ; and to indicate the extreme inherent
difficulty of this type of inquiry. (Freud himself was a
member of both the British and the American Societies for
Psychical Research.) The least unpromising future possi-
bility here lies in redoubled efforts to get people to send in
records of possibly precognitive experiences immediately,
before the forecast is verified (or falsified). This does at
least guarantee that some sort of prediction was in fact
made.
This safeguard has sometimes been available. West found
thirty-two such cases in the S.P.R. files. Not one of these
predictions deposited in advance came true : there were eight
misses about the date when the First German War would end,
and two failures on the Second German War; nine tips of
racing winners were all duds ;
three predictions of deaths, one
of marriage, one of meeting a certain friend at a club, and one
of winning a large sum in a football pool, were all unfulfilled.
(One unkind parenthesis : note the significant predominance
of agreeable, and the absence of any obviously unwelcome,
predictions ; and remember the unanimous failure of the
newspaper astrologers and psychic prophets to predict the out-
break of the last war ;
and recall once again Freud's law of
dream interpretation.) Then in 1933 Mr. J. W. Dunne's
procedure of writing down all dreams on waking was re-
peated with more adequate safeguards, under the auspices ofthe
S.P.R. But the total of apparent precognitions in no way
confirmed his contentions. Yet even were the future results
of this sort of effort less
damping than they were in these
instances, there would remain the two further and endlessly
debatable problems of finding whether the successes were
significant and whether they could not be explained as the
normal if sometimes the unusual products of conscious
and unconscious observation and ratiocination. However
skilful and careful the researchers and no one should under-
estimate the calibre of Myers, the Sidgwicks, and their
successors and however much they in the future reinforce
their experience of this field with new statistical
techniques

We are not trying to prove, or even to hint, that no spon-
taneous mental phenomena ever do involve any paranormal
factor : but only to show the sort of cases which have been
collected and studied; and to indicate the extreme inherent
difficulty of this type of inquiry. (Freud himself was a
member of both the British and the American Societies for
Psychical Research.) The least unpromising future possi-
bility here lies in redoubled efforts to get people to send in

and psychoanalytic skill : still the inherent difficulties render
the outlook for this approach very poor indeed.
While it is desirable that the effort to collect good cases
should continue, there seems little
hope that the study of such
material can, even at best, ever be more than suggestive of
possibilities,
but in itself inconclusive. It is
suggestive of
possibilities
at two stages :
first, when one is in doubt about
the reality of telepathy, clairvoyance, or precognition it
may
suggest that there are phenomena which cannot be accounted
for without postulating some such factor or factors ; second,
if the reality of these factors is established it
may be used to
suggest possible further lines of experimental investigation.
If we are ever to prove or disprove the reality of*' psychic
"
mental phenomena, and to explain and control them if they
do exist, it seems that it will only be by the tried methods of
controlled experiment, which are so immeasurably successful
in other fields. Only by controlling the conditions can we
eliminate decisively the possibility that the successes are the
products of normal observation and inference. Only by
repeating the same experimental procedures sufficiently often
can we establish statistically that the successes are not mere
flukes. And if and when this has been done it will only
be by experimenting and varying the conditions of our
experiments (while still of course preserving the safeguards
against normal explanation) that we can hope to learn more
about the paranormal factors involved. The investigation of
spontaneous cases
may act as a stimulus and provide sugges-
tions : as it has already done. But the future lies not in the
Micawber method of waiting for something to turn up, but
in controlled experiments, whether on mediums or on more
commonplace suojects ;
particularly perhaps in the deplorably
dull but
statistically manageable quantitative experiments.
We have to conclude with another phrase from Bacon
"
to put Nature to the Question."

was built in 1863 was apparently vouched for by reputable
witnesses, notably by members of the series of unfortunate in-
cumbents. Regrettably Price (who, by the way, should not
be confused with Professor H. H. Price of Oxford, who has
been President of the S.P.R.) both insisted on playing a lone
hand and wrote up his findings in a journalistic style in which
it is almost impossible to tell the truth. Various penetrating
criticisms of the Borley work have been made from time to
time in S.P.R. publications (cf. e.g. Journal, Vol. XXXIV, No.
643). Since his death two leading members, Dr. E. J. Ding*
wall and Mrs. K. M. Goldney, have undertaken to work over
the Borley records and others of Price's papers. Their report
which the present writer expects to be devastating will
doubtless soon appear in the S.P.R. Proceedings] and some
part of it at least is
likely to be reproduced in a definitive
volume on Borley which Dr. Paul Tabori is said to be editing.
In the meantime
just
six assorted points. First, Borley
Rectory was a rambling house with no less than three stair-
cases, which might almost have been designed for jiggery-
pokery. Second, the quotation from the Daily Mirror of
11/6/29 given a proud place in Price's The Most Haunted House
in England (Longmans, p. 4) has been totally distorted by an
unacknowledged excision; it
originally appeared under the
accurate headline
"
Midnight Apparition that Proved to be a
Maid." Third, it is
simply not the case that all incumbents
vouched for hauntings ; for at any rate Canon Lawton spent a
month in Borley in 1933 uneventfully (cf.
his letter in the
Spectator at p. 396 of the 1940 volume). Fourth, Price went
out ofhis way both to get as observers people without experi-
ence of psychical research and to suggest to them what they
might see (cf.
his own account, loc. cit.
p. 106 and App. B). It
should surprise no one with even a
smattering
of the psycho-
logy of suggestion, testimony, and hallucination to learn that
a substantial proportion of them managed to oblige. Fifth,
though Price nimself prints the testimony of the Rev. L. A.
Foyster that there was a rat-trap in the hall in January 1932
(loc.
cit.
p. 82), he insists, in spite of the fact that the house
was next door to a farm, that neither had he seen traces ofnor
had any other observer mentioned rats (loc. cit.
p. 62). This
is not a trivial matter. Rats unaided could account for a large

-which the present writer expects to be devastating-will
doubtless soon appear in the S.P.R. Proceedings; and some
part of it at least is likely to be reproduced in a definitive

In the meantime rl.ust six assorted points. First, Bodey
Rectory was a ramb ing house with no less than three stair-
cases, which might almost have been designed for jiggery-
pokery. Second, the guotation from the Daily Mirror of
II/6/29 given a proud place in Price's The Most Haunted House
in England (Longmans, p. 4) has been totally distorted by an
unacKnowledged excision; it originally appeared under the
accurate headline " Midnight Apparition that Proved to be a

is not a trivial matter. Rats unaided could account for a large

number of the Borley phenomena, especially the mysterious
ringing of the old-fashioned wire-operated house bells.
Sixth, in view of the testimony of Lord Charles Hope in the
distasteful affair of the exposure of Rudi Schneider (Proc.
S.P.R., Vol. XLI, pp. 284-91), Price's personal integrity
cannot be considered to be beyond question. All of which
may suggest that it would be unwise to base much on the
Borley case.
The material on poltergeist outbreaks is far more abundant
than that on haunted houses. The term
"
poltergeist
"
(German: meaning literally "boisterous spirit ')
has been
used for a long time to describe this particular pattern of
occurrences. To avoid commitment to any theory it might
be better, though awkward, to speak of poltergeistic dis-
turbances or poltergeistic outbreaks. These are sporadic,
starting suddenly and unexpectedly, and endingjust as suddenly
and unexpectedly, after a few days, or weeks, or months of
annoyance to those concerned. Typically they begin with the
occurrence in a building of inexplicable noises, usually per-
cussive thuds, taps, drumbeats, raps. There are often
sounds of heavy objects crashing to the ground. But usually
the damage done, if any, is small compared with the sound
heard. The shaking of beds, often very violent, is common.
So is the throwing of stones. It is also alleged that heavy
objects are moved inexplicably ; objects suddenly appear
from
outside a closed room; so do mysterious patches or water or
ofoil.
Objects are said to move about in the air horizontally ;
or to fall so slowly that their motion can easily be followed
by
the eye, and they land eventually without any noise or shock
of impact. Sometimes the
"
poltergeist
"
will communicate
by raps, or at least respond appropriately to a request spoken
or unspoken for a certain number of raps. Poltergeistic
disturbances have been recorded in many different places and
in many different periods : and the extraordinary uniformity
ofthese accounts has often been remarked. There are records
left by very early missionaries in Peru. The famous case of
the Drummer of Tedworth was reported by the Rev.
Joseph Glanville, one ofthe early Fellows ofthe Royal Society.
The Epworth case, occurring in the household of Jom
Wesley's father, is often mentioned. Similar reports came

from Roman Catholic missionaries in Cochin China, But all
this is, from the point ofview ofpsychical research, prehistoric.
The great landmark in the modern inquiries is Podmore's
study (" Poltergeists," Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XII). He analysed
all the cases which had so far been reported on by S.P.R. in-
vestigators, eleven in all. He had himself at one time been a
Spiritualist. (Modern Spiritualism dates its origin from the
poltergeist rappings associated with the Fox sisters, Margaret
and Katie, in the small American town of Hydesville in 1848.)
But in his maturer years he earned a reputation for scepticism.
In this matter he found plenty to be sceptical about.
In several of these eleven cases direct proofs of trickery had
been obtained. The eleven cases seemed to be suitable
representatives of the whole class :
they had, indeed, been
selected for investigation in the first
place from the larger
number which had been brought to the notice of the S.P.R.
precisely because they had presented a pritnafacie case for para-
normal agency, and the stories are so uniform that it seems
likely that the same causes have been operating in all cases.
Podmore was at particular pains to point out that where the
phenomena had oeen recorded shortly after they had been
observed, and by educated witnesses, trickery could, even
when it had not actually been proved, provide an adequate
explanation considerations of motive apart. Where they
had been described by uneducated people, and recorded some
time after the event, it is difficult to explain them away by
this method; and the difficulty increased directly with the
length of the interval, and varied
inversely
with the level of
education of the witnesses. He concluded :
if the opportunity had been given to us, with the experience
which we have now obtained, to undertake an equally full and
searching inquiry into the cases of this kind which figure so
largely in the literature of the subject, the evidence for abnormal
agency would have been found as little calculated to convince
(Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XII, p. 114).
In 1902, in Modern Spiritualism (Methuen, two vols.), he
supplemented this paper by applying his interpretation to
some of the classical cases ;
and developed his earlier observa-
tion that the phenomena nearly always cluster around, and

explanation-considerations of motive apart. Where they
haa been described by uneducated people, and recorded some
time after the event, it is difficult to explain them away by
this method; and the difficulty increased directly with the
length of the interval, and varied inversely with the level of
education of the witnesses. He concluded:
if the opportunity ha.d been given to us, with the experience
which we have now obtained, to undertake an equally full and
searching inquiry into the cases of this kind which figure so
largely in the literature ofthe subject, the evidence for abnormal
agency would have been found as little calculated to convince
(Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XII, p. rr4).
In 1902, in Modern Spiritualism (Methuen, two vols.), he
supplemented this paper by applying his interpretation to
some of the classical-cases ; and developed his earlier observa-
tion that the phenomena nearly always cluster around, and

have in many cases been shown to have been produced by,
what would now be called a problem child an adolescent,
mentally or physically subnormal and badly adjusted to his,
or more often to her, circumstances. This, or course, sug-
gests possible motives. .
But things were not allowed to rest there. A controversy
developed between Podmore and Andrew Lang (the classical
scholar and amateur of anthropology). Lang, relying almost
entirely on cases of ancient vintage such as those of the
Drummer ofTedworth (1661-3) and ofthe Wesley household
at Epworth (1716-17) contended that there was more to it
than trickery, hallucination, and the morbid psychology of
adolescents. (He wrote derisively of the
"
naughty little girl
theory/')
In 1911 Professor William Barrett, F.R.S., reopened the
question again with a paper in which he examinee! six cases,
two of which he had himself investigated in Ireland. His
main conclusion was
"
that fraud and hallucination are
inadequate to explain all the phenomena
"
(Proc. S.P.R., Vol.
XXV, p. 410). He gave an account of the Derrygonelly case,
which he had observed personally, while the phenomena
were still
going on.
The household [he wrote] consisted of a grey-headed farmer,
who had recently lost his wife, and a family of four girls and one
boy, the youngest about ten years of age, and the eldest, Maggie,
round whom the disturbances arose, about twenty years old.
The cottage had the usual large kitchen and dwelling-room,
with earthen floors in the centre, and a smaller room opening
from each side. In one of them Maggie and the girls slept on a
large, old-fashioned four-post bed. . . .
My own observations
were as follows : After the children, except the boy, had gone to
bed, Maggie lay down on the bed without undressing, so that
her hands and feet could be observed. The rest of us sat round
the kitchen fire, when faint raps, rapidly increasing in loudness,
were heard, coming apparently from the walls, the ceiling,
and various parts of the inner room, the door of which was
open . . . after much patience I was able to bring the light
into the bedroom whilst the disturbances were still
loudly
going on. ... The younger children were apparently asleep,
and Maggie was motionless ; nevertheless knocks were going on

Suddenly a large pebble fell in my presence on the bed;
no one had moved to dislodge it even if it had been placed for
the purpose. When I
replaced the candle on the window-sill

by a heavy carpenter's hammer driving nails into flooring.
The case occurred in 1887, and Barrett published a detailed
account in the Dublin University Magazine for December of
that year : but our quotations come from his own summary
of that account in the 1911 paper.
In 1917 now Sir William Barrett he looked into another
case which, with the help of an electrical engineer, who seems
to have done most of the actual investigation, he presented to
the S.P.R. A summary of this case can be found in G. N. M.
Tyrrell's The Personality of Man (Pelican Books). But it is
worth noting that Sir William unfortunately arrived too late
himself to witness any curious occurrences. He writes,

assistant. (The disturbances had occurred in the erection of a
dug-out.) His conclusion was that the interpretation of the
evidence was a matter for individual judgment. But before
reaching it he once again drew attention to the long and wide
tradition ofpoltergeistic phenomena ; mentioning particularly
that old favourite the Drummer of Tedworth, which is
recorded in Glanville's Sadducismus Triumphatus. He was a
person whom Lecky had called
"
a man of incomparable

and of whose book the same author had said,

It
would be difficult to find a work displaying
less of credulity

out : and ends with the Parthian shot that one should not
take all the evidence piecemeal, dismissing it item by item.

ten leaky buckets will hold water though one will not with
the valid weight of accumulated evidence principle that many

in 1 874. It was perhaps the reliefat meeting such an untypical
medium that misled Myers into accepting as genuinely para-
normal physical phenomena produced under very lax and
unsatisfactory conditions of control and observation.
The first
big contribution after the formation of the S.P.R.
was the classic
paper by Hodgson and Davey.
"
The Possi-
bilities of Malobservation and Lapse of Memory from a
Practical Point of View/' published in 1887 (Proc. S.P.R., Vol.
IV). Hodgson had returned from the Indian visit by which
he disposed of the miracles of Mme. Blavatsky and her
acolytes the richer by much knowledge and experience. At
that time the slate-writing phenomena of a medium called
Eglinton were declared by many in spite of the man's
blotted past to be inexplicable by normal methods. Hodg-
son's friend Davey made a special study ofslate-writing tricks
and, when he had acquired sufficient skill, gave sittings under
a false name, making no statement as to whether the methods
were normal or paranormal. Hodgson introduced a care-
fully chosen group of sitters, including several experienced
members of the S.P.R. Afterwards they recorded what they
had seen, or thought they had seen. In their very long and
exhaustive paper Hodgson and Davey quote these records,
and then after each in turn point out how far it deviates from
the actual course of events ;
what loop-holes
sitters had over-
looked, and Davey had exploited, for his conjuring tricks.
The moral of their sobering achievement was that continuous
observation particularly in the customary conditions of the
seance room is a practical impossibility; so that evidence
depending solely on watching a medium must always be un-
reliable. One rather painful curiosity calls for parenthetic
mention. Certain leading Spiritualists including Alfred
Russel Wallace, whose name, on account of his biological
writings, is often coupled with that of Darwin remained
unconvinced. Wallace wrote that Mr. Davey's performances
"
are claimed to be all trick, and unless all can be so explained
many of us will be confirmed in our belief that Mr. Davey
was really a medium as well as a conjurer." So after
Davey's premature death Hodgson wrote a further paper of

cussion, with references, of Wallace's views comes at pp.

in the ensuing years : both by the results of further similar
experimental studies; and by the embarrassing experiences

into testifying to the paranormal powers of physical mediums

been. The evidence ofrecognition on which contemporary

Some people would recognize anything. A broom and a

enthusiasts. ... I have had pictures that might be anything

The most impressive physical medium studied in the period
MBDIUMSHIP: PHYSICAL 37
before the First German War was the Neapolitan Eusapia
Palladino. She first made her name by sittings in Italy,
France, and Poland. The Sidgwicks, Myers, Sir Oliver
Lodge, and several well-known continental researchers
attended some of these, and were impressed. She came to
Cambridge in 1895. Suspicions were aroused at early sittings.
Later Hodgson attended and showed what he had already
suspected from previously published reports that, and how,
she used her great muscular strength to get one hand free
by
making the other do duty for two, so that the sitters on eacn
side who were supposed to be controlling one hand each
were unwittingly holding the same hand. But psychical
researchers abroad continued their investigations on the
grounds that some of the recorded phenomena could not be
explained by her detected methods of trickery. In 1908 the
S.P.R. made an exception to its traditional rule to refuse to

appointing a team to have further sittings. It was a powerful
team, consisting of Everard Fielding, W. W. Baggally, and
Hcreward Carrington. All three had had plenty of experi-
ence in investigating physical mediums, and were familiar
with all the known tricKs. They held eleven sittings and
observed striking things at ten of them :
mysterious raps,
lights, movements of curtains, twangings of a guitar, the pro-
duction ofa tangible hand at a distance from the medium, and
so on. Since they constituted just about the best-qualified
group ever to pronounce in favour of the genuineness of a
physical mediumship in the
pre-mechanical period of investi-
gation, it is worth quoting from their conclusions, published
in the following year :
It was only through constant repetition of the same pheno-
menon, in a good light and at moments when its occurrence
was expected, and after finding that none of the precautions
that we took had any influence in impeding it, that we gradually
reached the conviction that some force was in
play
which was
beyond the reach of ordinary control, and beyond the skill of
the most skilful conjurer. But though we have come to that
general conclusion, we find it exceedingly difficult to
say
to
which particular phenomena, or even to which particular kind
of phenomena, we have sufficiently strict evidence to apply it.
MEDIUMS HIP: PHYSICAL 37
before the First German War was the Neapolitan Eusapia
Palladino. She first made her name by sittings in Italy,
France, and Poland. The Sidgwicks, Myers, Sir Oliver
Lodge, and several well-known continental researchers
attended some of these, and were impressed. She came to
Cambridge in 1895. Suspicions were aroused at early sittings.
Later Hodgson attended and showed-what he had already
suspected from previously published reports-that, and how,
she used her great muscular strength to get one hand free by
making the other do duty for two, so that the sitters on each
side-who were supposed to be controlling one hand each-
were unwittingly holding the same hand. But psychical
researchers abroad continued their investigations on the
grounds that some of the recorded phenomena could not be
explained by her detected methods of trickery. In 1908 the
S.P.R. made an exception to its traditional rule to refuse to
examine mediums once caught deliberately tricking by
appointing a team to have further sittings. It was a powerful
team, consisting of Everard Fielding, W. W. Baggally, and
Hereward Carrington. All three had had plenty of experi-
ence in investigating physical mediums, and were familiar
with all the loiown tricks. They held eleven sittings and
observed striking things at ten of them : mysterious raps,
lights, movements ofcurtains, twangings ofa guitar, the pro-
duction ofa tangible hand at a distance from the medium, and
so on. Since they constituted just about the best-qualified
group ever to pronounce in favour of the genuineness of a

MEDIUMSHIP: PHYSICAL 39
series of sittings for the Society, in which apparently genuine
paranormal phenomena were produced ; though not either as
numerous or as striking as those reported from his seances else-
where. In one of these an attempt was made using apparatus
specially designed by Lord Rayleigh (son of the O. M.)
to obtain a silhouette photograph of the putative invisible
substance, able to absorb infra-red rays but elusive to ordinary
flashlight cameras, which Dr. Osty and Mr. Besterman had
reported as
produced in Paris at a distance from his person :
without success.
This enterprise was not as wild as it sounds. In the first
place, Osty deserves credit for introducing infra-red apparatus
to pierce the shrouding blanket of the seance darkness ;
and
secondly there had been indirect confirmation of the truth of
the original claim which makes it
very difficult to explain
away. In the French tests the obscurations of the infra-red
ray at a safe distance from the medium were automatically
recorded by a galvanometer coupled with a photographic
recording drum adapted to give a continuous graph of the
deflections. It was noticed that the galvanometer spot moved
in sympathy with the loud, rapid, breathing of the entranced
medium :
expiration and inspiration each involved muscular
effort ; and the number and time of the infra-red ray obscura-
tions corresponded with the number and time of these
muscular efforts. After this the motions of the medium's
chest were recorded on the same chart as the infra-red obscura-
tions. At earlier sessions before either set of automatic
recording apparatus had been installed it had been arranged
that obscuration of the infra-red ray should set a bell ringing :
several times flashlight photos taken immediately had revealed
the medium in his trance position, well away from either the
bell or the ray, and properly held by experimenters.
It should be emphasized that even these examples are not
representative of physical mediums in general; but are
selected as unusually impressive specimens who attracted the
attention of S.P.R. researchers ^/conceded facilities to them.
More typical would be Mrs. Helen Duncan. She was an
example of that almost extinct species, the British physical
medium. She specialized in ectoplasm. The S.P.R. never
as such had dealings with her, though members at various

times attended her seances. But in 1931, after she had been
studied by the London Spiritualist Alliance, Mr. Harry Price
hired her to give five sittings for his National Laboratory of
Psychical Research. His team attempted no control of her
person : but relied entirely upon a rigorous search carried out
before and after every sitting (and
'
rigorous
"
is the right
word, for she was not merely stripped but on two occasions
her vagina and rectum were also examined). After this she
was dressed in a one-piece seance suit and led directly to her
chair in the cabinet. The problem throughout was not so
much whether there was fraud, but how precisely it was done.
Mr. Price took several flashlight photographs showing the
medium draped with ectoplasm. This was unmistaKably
identified as cheese-cloth by its rents, tears, marks of folding,
clearly distinguishable warp, woof, and selvedge marks ; and
one particular tear reappeared in another seance, showing that
the same
"

"
had been used on both occasions. At the
third seance a
"
hand
"
was

: the photographs
revealed this as a rubber glove. At the first four sittings the
medium's husband was present, kept well away from her,
behind the row ofsitters ; but at the fifth he was not. At this
sitting there was no abundant extrusion of cheese-cloth
ectoplasm. A few beggarly inches protruded from the
medium's mouth. A portion was amputated. It consisted
of layers of lavatory paper stuck together. Attempts to in-
duce Mrs. Duncan to reproduce the whole performance in
front of a cine-camera all failed : and so it is
impossible to be
sure whether it was a feat of regurcitation, and if so how this
was done on such an impressive scale ; for X-ray photographs
had not been very helpful, except in confirming that safety-
pins played some part
in the transcendental mechanism. Mrs.
Duncan retired in haste to the provinces. There, out of
range of Mr. Harry Price's formidable armaments, she
flourished. She travelled widely, giving stances in the homes
of Spiritualists. The sheets of ectoplasm gave place, at least
in rumour, to full materializations ofthe departed. Accounts
of spirit identifications at her stances became a regular feature
of the Spiritualist paper Psychic News. In 1933 she was tried,

were turned up that they revealed Mrs.
Duncan stuffing a torn undervest
up her dress. In 1944 she
was tried again, this time at the Old Bailey, and in spite of a
first-class defence, financed by a special Spiritualist fund, she
was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment.
The whole trial provides an interesting study in testimony.
But as precisely for this reason the complicated facts which
so many witnesses were misdescribing are themselves obscure,
the point about the extreme unreliability of stance testimony
is best made again by referring to a study made by S.P.R.
members in more clinical conditions. Mr. Besterman
arranged a faked seance. He pretended to be a physical
medium. His sitters knew that he had no paranormal powers,
and were instructed to watch carefully. They were after-
wards given a fifteen-point questionnaire. Tney averaged
only 33-9 per cent correct answers : the variation being
between 5-9 and 61 per cent. And this poor performance was
put up by educated and experienced observers.
Admittedly
the lighting was weak as is
customary at seances; but all
knew the sitting was a fake. There was none of the usual
emotional atmosphere to excite and misguide : no suggestion
of the supernatural nor of communication with people loved
and longed for.
Reading the history ofthe investigation ofphysical medium-
ship a voluminous and often sordid history even the most
charitable critic must be inclined to conclude that things now
stand very much where they stood before. Of course the
experimental studies of the psychology of observation and
testimony remain as solid achievements. And the mass of
knowledge accumulated about the methods of deception has
a perhaps rather esoteric value. But nevertheless there have
been a few observations recorded where it is difficult to believe
that the investigators could have been deceived; something
genuinely paranormal may have occurred.
But once again, as with the study of both types of spon-
taneous phenomena, there seems to be something radically
unsatisfactory and inherently frustrating about this form of
inquiry. Every physical medium has his or her own range
of performances. A specified programme cannot be repro-
duced at the researcher s will. Even the best performers nave

have been proved in case after case.
There can be little

study of the abnormal psychology of the performers (for

successful physical medium comes forward, prepared to

the physical mediums usually refuse to permit free variation
of the conditions of their performances ; insisting no doubt
only too truly that daylight would inhibit them. But
mental mediumship is a much more tractable subject. There
is no great difficulty in recording, verbatim and at the time of
utterance, all the words which come out of the medium's
mouth (and
in some cases the medium may save everyone
trouble oy herself writing her communications). So with
care you can be sure you know what are the major positive
facts calling for assessment and explanation. Furthermore,
there is much more chance that a mental medium will permit
the investigator to make any tests he wants : which, consisting
largely as these will of putting questions, give fewer grounds
for objection.
All the technical terms are prejudicial, assuming some sort
of spiritistic view.
"
Medium
"
suggests a medium of trans-
mission, an intermediary between two parties;
"
Communi-
cator
"
implies that some person (other than the medium) is
communicating with the sitters. But they are sanctioned by
custom, and do save cumbrous circumlocution : so we will use
them here, after disowning their prejudicial implications.
The terms suggest, and were intended to suggest, a particular
model of the seance situation. The Medium is considered as a
sort of telephone, to which the sitter (or sitters) listen, and
through wnich he (or they) can in turn speak to the Control.
The Control is

the physical mediums usually refuse to permit free variation
of the conditions of their performances ; insisting-no doubt
only too truly-that daylight would inhibit them. But
mental mediumship is a much more tractable subject. There
is no great difficulty in recording, verbatim and at the time of
utterance, all the words which come out of the medium's
mouth (and in some cases the medium may save everyone
trouble by herself writing her communications). So with
care you can be sure you know what are the major positive
facts calling for assessment and explanation. Furthermore,
there is much more chance that a mental medium will permit
the investigator to make any tests he wants : which, consisting
largely as these will of putting questions, give fewer grounds
for objection.
All the technical terms are prejudicial, assuming some sort
of spiritistic view. " Medium " suggests a medium of trans-
mission, an intermediary between two parties; " Communi-
cator" implies that some person (other than the medium) is
communicating with the sitters. But they are sanctioned by
custom, and do save cumbrous circumloc~tion: so we will use
them here, after disowning their prejudicial implications.
The terms suggest, and were intended to suggest, a particular
model of the seance situation. The Medium is considered as a
sort of telephone, to which the sitter (or sitters) listen, and
through which he (or they) can in tum speak to the Control.
The Control is thought of as a sort of official at the other end
("on the other side") who converses with would-be Com-
municators, and relays their messages to the sitters. " Medium"
is best confined to cover those who produce these performances
in trance : leaving "Automatist" to describe the person who
produces when not in a trance the similar phenomenon of
automatic writing, that is to say writing done without the con-
scious control of the writer.

and they have been studied primarily with a view to finding
out whether they really are what they claim to be. A stagger-
ing mass of work has been done ;
unfortunately it is not the
sort which can be convincingly summarized. In this chapter
we shall attempt to do only two things :
first, to give an idea
of the sort of material produced by one or two of the more
impressive mental mediums and automatists ; and, second, to
give a few cases to show how very careful it is
necessary to be
in supervising the production of or assessing such material.
The accent is on the word
"
impressive," for the content of
the communications provided by the average medium is
rarely such as to excite speculation. We know what to think
when we are introduced to
Milton composing baby-rhymes, and Locke
Reasoning in gibberish.
As an example of an impressive mental medium let us take
Mrs. Osborne Leonard. There are plenty ofcareful and well-
annotated records of sittings with her. Furthermore, all
investigators, irrespective oftheir views about her phenomena,
agree about her complete personal integrity :
which, after
dealing with physical mediums, comes as a relief. She
developed psychic interests as a child, but then these were re-
pressed by her parents. She started to develop her powers,
especially through table-tilting, immediately after her mother's
death. At one of her table-lifting sessions a Communicator
gave her name as
"
Feda." She later became Mrs. Leonard's
chief Control, and her personality enlivens the records of the
sittings. In the spring of 1914
"
Feda
"
gave Mrs. Leonard
repeated messages to begin work as a professional medium as
soon as possible.
"
Something big and terrible is

Life in Two Worlds (Cassell, 1931) : from here the develop-

Sir Oliver Lodge brought her into contact with the Society.

given a description of a close friend (always referred to as
46 MEDIUMSHIP: MENTAL
A. V. B.) who had died some months before. Shortly after
this she and Lady Troubridge arranged to have regular sittings.
For five months both sat at least once a week, one being the in-
terlocutor, while the other took notes, being careful to record
everything said by the other two during the trance, and any
conversation with the medium before and after it. In the
course of many years they received correct statements, pur-
porting to come from A. V. B., about many things which
they thought could not have been within Mrs. Leonard's
normal knowledge, such as places visited and things done by
A. V. B. and Miss Radclyffe-Hall together; and the contem-
porary interests and affairs of the sitters. The two investi-
gators employed a private detective agency to find out
whether inquiries had recently been made at any of the
obvious sources of information ;
but drew a blank.
One technique which was later used
systematically by
other investigators was the proxy sitting. They sat as
proxies
for a friend
"
Daisy Armstrong," who was away in the Near
East at the time, and were given correct statements not only
about her intended movements but also about her adoptive
father. The former were in conflict with their own expecta-
tions at the time, and they had known nothing about the
adoptive father. The Communicator seemed to speak ofhim
as d.ead; and he had died three days before, though neither
the sitters nor Daisy knew this at the time. The point of the
proxy sitting technique is to
try
to exclude two possibilities :
that the correct information is drawn from the sitter normally
by fishing (or even paranormally by telepathy) ; or that the
medium has, consciously or unconsciously, done some pre-
liminary research.
Another technique which again was later used systematic-
ally was the book-test. This was suggested by
"
Feda
"
:
the idea was that
"
she
"
should indicate a particular page of a
particular volume, which Mrs. Leonard had never seen, and
should state what was to be found on that page. The first
two investigators, who did not know Greek, arranged a shelf
of Greek books in an order known only to themselves. Mrs.
Leonard did not know Greek either. Yet when later they
were checked some of the

These intriguing beginnings stimulated a great research
effort. Mrs. Leonard was persuaded to give sittings exclu-
sively to people sponsored by the S.P.R. for a period of three
months in 1918. In this period seventy-three sittings took
place ; thirty-one were given to twenty sitters who had never
gone to Mrs. Leonard before. A small S.P.R. committee
supervised the series, trying to ensure that a note-taker was
always present and that no one revealed the identity of the
new sitters. Unfortunately as Mrs. Salter, who wrote up
the results was careful to emphasize many of the
"
recog-
nitions "of" Communicators
"
were of doubtful value, since
by 1918 almost everyone must have known several young men
who had been killed in the war, and been tempted to mistake
appropriate (or even inappropriate) statements for distinctive
ones. Still the report does suggest that some paranormal
factor was operating: and later sittings have confirmed this
impression. (Though it should be stressed that to concede
the presence ofsome paranormal factor is
very far indeed from
conceding that the
"
spirits
of the dead
"
were sending
messages.)
In 1921 Mrs. Sidgwick published an analysis of the book-
test results. Of 532 cases which she examined she classified
ninety-two (about 17 per cent) as successful, 100 (about 19 per
cent) as nearly successful, ninety-six as doubtful, forty as almost
total failures, and 204 as total failures. In 1923 the results of a
control experiment were published. The idea was to see
whether these scores could be accounted for by chance, and
i, 800 sham book tests were analysed by another investigator.
Mrs. Sidgwick was in general agreement with his scorings.
The result was only thirty-four successes (under 2 per cent)
and fifty-one partial successes (under 3 per cent). A supple-
mentary control experiment has since been done, which also
tends to confirm Mrs. Sidgwick's conclusion that "Feda"
scored better than can be accounted for by chance alone. Of
course neither set of figures can be taken as more than an
approximate indication. Clearly the assessment ofscores must
be rather subjective ;

Proxy sittings have been tried often. One striking series
48 MEDIUMSHIP: MENTAL
resulted from a request made in 1936 by Professor E. R. Dodds
to the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas to try to get communications
from Mr. F. W. Macaulay. The latter had recently died. He
had been known neither to Professor Dodds nor to Mr.
Thomas, but the former knew his daughter Mrs. Lewis and
her husband, Professor Lewis. Mr. Thomas presented the
request at the sittings as coming from Macaulay's
daughter
"
Emma" (Mrs. Lewis). Five of these proxy sittings were
held, and the records were annotated afterwards by Mrs. Lewis.
In the first four the Communicator gave the estimate is
Mr. Thomas's ninety-four items of information. Both
Professor Dodds and Mr. Thomas awarded marks to each of
these statements independently, and their results were sub-
stantially the same. Mr. Thomas scored thirty-six as right,
ten as good, and twenty-four as fair; adding these figures
together to give a total ofseventy successes (over 70 per cent).
In the fifth sitting the
"
Communicator
"
was asked for infor-
mation about something which had happened after Macaulay's
death, namely his daughter's recent visit to Ireland. The
score this time was assessed at
twenty-five
successes to five
failures (over 83 per cent success). Three items will serve as
typical of the successes : the first two come from the first four
sittings : the third from the fifth.

together strongly suggest that the veridical information given

investigator.
He began to apply the well-estab-

Mrs. Leonard and her Controls and Communicators, and
to other mediums likewise. The technique is this : lists
of stimulus words are read to each subject, who is told to
respond with the first word that comes into his head; his
reactions (i.e.
what he says, the interval between the stimulus
and his saying it, and so forth) are recorded ; and these form a
reaction pattern characteristic of each subject. The idea was
to try to elucidate the question whether Control and

or were really as they purported to be, independent
personalities.

herself Sally Beauchamp : she showed an intense dislike of B I
and claimed to know B Ts thoughts. In B IV she behaved in
an exactly opposite way to that in B I, being in B IV self-

in a very complicated way according to which state she was in.
In B III she could remember things she could not recall in B I,
and also reported observations from times when (in B I) she
had been absorbed in thought and which in B I she could not
draw on. In B I the patient could recall none of her doings in
B III but had to make inferences, be told by Prince, or read
letters (very mischievous and rude) left by herself in B III. In
B III the patient refused to admit her identity with the patient in
B I, B II, or B IV : but in B I she always felt somehow respon-

those done in B III, which she could not remember. Prince's
cure consisted in the slow reassembly of the dissociated frag-
ments of Miss Beauchamp's personality. In the cured patient
there were elements of most states, just as there had been before
the traumatic experience (being kissed in Providence, Rhode
Island?!) which touched off the fragmentation. The cured
Miss Beauchamp was, as it were, B I but with a bit of the old
B IV about her ; though Prince notes that his cured patient
seemed to contain no element of
"
Sally."
"

"
provides
an excellent example of what is meant by a secondary
personality."
Psychical researchers had long been aware of the
resemblances between such secondary personalities in non-
mediumistic psychopaths and the Controls of mediums ; and
some believed that intermediate cases could be detected in
which a psychopathic secondary personality had gifts for the
paranormal acquisition of information e.g. Dr. Walter
Prince (who, by the way, was not the same as Dr. Morton
Prince, mentioned above) believed this was true of
"
Sleeping
Margaret" in the Doris Fischer case, which he studied and
treated (Proc. American S.P.R., 1917). But Carington was the
first to try to put the question of the status of Controls to
experimental test. His results were reported in a series oflong
and highly technical papers, in the course ofwhich he acknow-
ledged several changes of view and improvements in method

herselfSally Beauchamp : she showed an intense dislike ofB I
and claimed to know B I's thoughts. In B IV she behaved in
an exactly opposite way to that in B I, being in B IV self-
willed and aggressive. The patient's memory range varied
in a very complicated way according to which state she was in.
In B III she could remember things she could not recall in B I,
and also reported observations from times when (in B I) she
had been absorbed in thought-and which in B I she could not
draw on. In B I the patient could recall none ofher doings in
B III but had to maKe inferences, be told by Prince, or read
letters (very mischievous and rude) left by herselfin B III. In
B III the patient refused to admit her identitywith the patientin
B I, B II, orB IV: but in B I she always felt somehow respon-
sible for things done in all the other three states-even for
those done in B III, which she could not remember. Prince's

made in response to his own and other people's criticisms. The
main upshot was the development of a method for the quanti-
tative study of trance personalities (Controls and Communi-
cators) : for Carington was not able to apply his technique
to a sufficient number of mediums to permit definitive con-
clusions. But, as far as they go, his results tend to confirm
the secondary personality view of Controls. "Feda" and
Mrs. Leonard, for instance, yielded counter-similar reaction
patterns :
i.e., negatively correlated ones like Jack Sprat and
his wife. Each scored high where the other scored low, and
vice versa. As for the Communicators, Carington after
some discussion agreed with Dr. R. H. Thouless that the
results were those to be expected
"
if there were no real
communicating spirits who communicated sometimes through
one medium and sometimes through another." But later he
revised some of the previous work, added some more, and
again got results suggesting the possible autonomy of the
Communicators. Perhaps the most promising and desir-
able of all
possible future moves in the study of mental
mediumship would be to
apply Carington's methods and
other suitably adapted psychological tests to a lot more
mediums and their Controls and Communicators: and,
as a control experiment, to the various states of a group
of seriously dissociated psychopaths of Miss Beauchamps :
if
only
the advance ofpsychiatry had not apparently prevented
the development of more such cases. Carington himself
planned to apply his tests to a group ofliving people and then
to apply the same tests after their deaths to any Communi-
cators claiming identity with them. This plan, too, is one
which we may hope to see executed in future years. Clearly
it would take a long time to complete, unless all the original
subjects were very bad insurance risks ! Most mediumistic
material can be assessed differently by equally reasonable people,
but here there is a prospect of getting data free from the
element of subjectivity.
Enough, for the moment, on mental mediumship proper.

interpretation. Besides clear-cut mediumship, there is also

the most striking case was that of the
"
Patience Worth"
scripts produced by a Mrs. John H. Curran of St. Louis,
Missouri. She was a lady of limited knowledge and narrow
horizons, born in the Middle West. One day a friend per-
suaded her to put her hands to a planchette. (This is a
device resembling an ouija board consisting of a small
heart-shaped board with a pencil-point downwards at one
corner, and two little wheels or castors at the others, so that it
can move easily over paper, making pencil marks. It is thus
adapted to produce automatic writing or the appearance of
it ; as the case may be.) After a disappointing beginning,
quite suddenly
on July 8, 1913, scripts began which said they
were written by
"
Patience Worth.' From then on, through
the ouija board at first but later supplemented by spoken
words, an enormous literary output poured forth. In the end
it amounted to three million words, consisting mainly of
historical novels, but including some blank verse and miscel-
laneous writing. The novels, which found publishers, were
written in markedly different dialects, consistently sustained,
but all archaic and artificial.
"
Patience Worth," in answer
to questions, claimed to be a country girl who had left Dorset
in the middle of the seventeenth century for America, there to
be murdered by Red Indians.
"
She
"
had a strongly marked
character and a caustic tongue : not at all like Mrs. Curran in
her normal state. The case was studied and written up by
Dr. Walter Prince (The Case of Patience Worth, American
S.P.R., 1927) : Mr. G. N. M. Tyrrell gave some extracts from
the novels in The Personality of Man (Pelican Books, 1946,

of straightforward quasi-mediumistic automatism. But by

occur.
In the early years of this century several people connected
in various ways with the S.P.R. began to produce automatic

daughter Helen, who later became Mrs. W. H. Salter ;
and
Dame Edith Lyttelton. Later these were joined by a medium
of the ordinary type, the famous Mrs. Piper, who is memor-
able in the annals of the subject for being the first to provide
researchers with "communications*' the content of which
could be considered seriously, apart from any dubious support
provided by questionable physical phenomena purporting to
give emphatic warrant to their authenticity. The scripts
produced by this
"
S.P.R. group of automatists
"
claimed to
originate
from various leading members of the Society, who
had previously died: at first F. W. H. Myers (d. 1901),
Edmund Gurney (d. 1888), and Henry Sidgwick (d. 1900);
and later for the series went on for many years A. W.
Verrall (d. 1912) and Henry Butcher (J. 1910). All but one
ofthese
' '

"
had been classical scholars. Some
of the later scripts were not automatic writings : for Mrs.
Piper's productions were always stenographic
records of
trance speech ; and one other member of the group developed
from automatic writing to something much like ordinary
mediumship a fairly common process.
The plan for
"
cross-correspondences
"
was devised by
"
Myers
"
and his

colleagues. The idea
was to transmit one cryptic message through one automatist,
and at about the same time another equally unintelligible
through another writer ; and then to give a clue, through a
third person, which, though in itself meaningless, would,
when taken together with the other two, show a single mean-
ing and purpose. The cross-correspondence was to lie in
this jig-saw puzzle the pieces of which came through differ-
ent automatists and the subject of which would appear only
when those pieces had been properly fitted together. The
automatists were, of course, to be completely isolated from
one another throughout.
The object of this scheme was to eliminate the possibility
of dissolving away
"
proofs ofsurvival

in terms or telepathy
(or some such paranormal faculty) exercised by and between
living people. Even had everything gone perfectly according
to plan it is
questionable ifthis object could have been achieved

Parenthetically it is worth pointing out two parallels to this
initiative by
"
Myers
"
: Mrs. Leonard's
"
Feda
"
suggested
making book-tests; and B III
(" Sally") gave Dr. Morton
Prince a much less muddled way of looking at Miss Beau-
champ's various states and their interrelations than he had had
before (Dissociation of a Personality, Longmans, 1906, cf.
pp.
268 ff).
But up to the present no perfect cross-correspondence has
been found in the scripts. Several less perfect cases have been
worked out: where two automatists nave produced scripts
which, taken separately, are meaningless, but which, put to-
gether, explain and complement one another. Besides these
there are a large number of remarkable coincidences, where
the same, often rather recherche, subject is mentioned by two
or more automatists at about the same time. But it is even
harder to give quotations which are both fair and short to
illustrate these correspondences, than it is to do so to show the
quality of a stance. Things are not improved by the fact that
relevant parts of the scripts are full of disjointed and obscure
literary allusions, mainly classical.
With this warning, consider the Euripides example. On
March 4, 1907, in Mrs. Verrall's script there comes,
"
Hercules
Furens. [The Mad Hercules, a play by Euripides. This is
followed by a
"
message" to Dr. Verrall about the play.

there came
"

[Mrs. Verrall's Christian name was Margaret.
One of the characters in the Hercules Furens is called
"
Lukos,"
which would be Latinized as
"

the Hercules Furens in his Aristophanes

character in that was called
"

Sidgwick was sitting with Mrs. Piper when

claimed
that

"
was one of the words he had given in cross-
correspondences. Mrs. Verrall was of course familiar with
Euripides in the original. Mrs. Holland knew no Greek, and
denied that she had ever read the Browning poem.

and halfwith Eusapia Palladino, the two outstanding mediums
of their day, mental and physical respectively.) After the
death of Mr. Richard Hodgson whose name we have come
across earlier in connection with the exposure of Madame

"

appeared as a

"
in
Mrs. Piper's sittings. To the surprise of William James and
many of his other close friends, who had always regarded
Hodgson as an inflexible bachelor,
"
Hodgson
"
stated several
times that Hodgson had at one time wanted to marry a certain
American lady (details given). But James later discovered
that Hodgson had indeed proposed, unsuccessfully, to the
lady in question about ten years earlier. So he wrote,
"
As
Hodgson himself had apparently told no one, the incident
seemed an excellent one to count in favour of spirit-return,
unless indeed, it should turn out that while it was happening,
he had been led to consult the Piper-controls about it himself.
'
This was precisely how it did turn out. In a sitting the next
year
"
Hodgson
"
asked Professor Newbold whether he
remembered the lady. Thus stimulated he recalled that she
had frequently been mentioned at Piper sittings at which both
he and Hodgson had been present. This was confirmed
when he unearthed a letter written to him by Hodgson at the
time. James comments: "The entire incident shows the
importance of completeness in the records."
A second example: on February 10, 1938, Mrs. K. M.
Golduey ofwhose other contributions to the subject we shall
have more to say later attended a packed meeting at the
London Spiritualist Alliance at which Mrs. Helen Hughes
was operating. Mrs. Hughes pointed at Mrs. Goldney's

This was precisely how it did turn out. In a sitting the next
year "Hodgson" asked Professor Newbold whether he
remembered the lady. Thus stimulated he recalled that she
had frequently been mentioned at Piper sittings at which both
he and ·Hodgson had been present. This was confirmed
when he unearthed a letter written to him by Hodgson at the
time. James comments: "The entire incident shows the
importance of completeness in the records."
A second example: on February 10, 1938, Mrs. K. M.
Goldney-ofwhose other contributions to the subject we shall
have more to say later-attended a packed meeting at the
London Spiritualist Alliance at which Mrs. Helen Hughes
was operating. Mrs. Hughes pointed at Mrs. Goldney's
·neighbour. " There is someone here who has come for you:
BESSIE-wait rApparently listening to a spirit communi-
cator-KMG] BESSIE WHITE. Do you know BESSIE
WHITE? " The neighbour denied acquaintance. " That's

wait. It is not for you, but for the lady sitting next to
you." Mrs. Goldney then held up her hand.
"
Yes, that's
right. Bessie White is here for you. Do you recognize
her?" Mrs. Goldney after hesitating said,
"
Yes; I under-
stand that name."
"
BESSIE WHITE and ALECALEC
WHITE. Do you know him too?
"
Mrs.
Goldney under-
stood that too. She had hesitated before remembering a
private sitting which she had had with Mrs. Hughes a year
and nine months before. She looked up her notes of this
afterwards and confirmed that on that occasion, after getting
twenty-eight or more names, only three of which fitted
people she had known, she started to pretend to recognize
sortie. Among these were the fictitious Bessie White and
her non-existent son Alec. Mrs. Goldney was most careful
to stress both her confidence in Mrs. Hughes' integrity and the
limited significance of this sort of experience. But by esti-
mating on the basis ofinformation supplied by Mrs. Hughes
and her sponsors the total number of private sitters this most
successful medium would have every year, she indicated
what fabulous powers of memory might be available to such a
person in her trance state (Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XLV, pp. 210-16).
Besides such examples showing amazing memory, capacity
in trance states, there are plenty of others to show equally
remarkable powers of unconscious creative work. As a third
case take the famous Helene Smith, studied by Professor
Flournoy and others at Geneva. She manifested a Com-

A fourth cautionary tale is
provided by the results of a

by an account of a sitting given by Mrs. Bedford a profes-
sional medium to a Mrs. G., got the secretary ofthe London
Spiritualist Alliance to select for him four women, who like
Mrs. G., were regular sitters and over the age of forty. He
then got them to annotate the substance of the
"
communi-
cation "given to Mrs. G., which had been published under the
title
"
Veridical Information given by a Medium on Matters
outside the Sitter's Knowledge/' In order not to impose on the
four ladies too much, he mixed it with material directed at
them from another medium. In two cases out of the four he
drew a complete blank. One knew two families to each of
which many but by no means all of the statements applied.
But the fourth lady found that all but three items fitted per-
fectly: while one fitted her better than it fitted Mrs. G.
Parsons underlined the moral, stressing that this should not
be construed as an attack on Mrs. Bedford. Here was a
lengthy and detailed statement which seemed to provide
evidence at least of paranormal cognition, and perhaps of
survival :
yet when it was circulated to only four people, one
recognized it as almost wholly applicable to herself; which
shows how easily something which is
only appropriate to one
particular person may be mistaken for something which is
distinctive ojf
that person. (See Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XLVIII, pp.
344 )
Cases such as these four certainly warn against taking
mediumistic material at its face value precipitately. But once
the dangers are known, precautions can be taken. The
fabulous memory capacities can be frustrated by using sitters
unknown to the medium. They can then have no relevant
memories to draw on. Control tests such as that done by
Parsons can be used to check whether the fit of the material
to the sitter really is remarkable. The records can be kept

unconscious artistic creation. It seems to the present writer
that there is
enough mediumistic material produced in
adequately guarded circumstances and of such a quality as to
require us to postulate some paranormal factor. Though one
has to admit that the assessment of whether or not such phe-
nomena point to a paranormal factor is at present a very
subjective matter, depending as much on the assessor's general
world outlook as on the circumstances of any particular case.

selves, then it would be rash and probably careless to be simi-
larly complacent. Ofcourse, as it is, we do not have to assess
either the spontaneous or the mediumistic phenomena
separately, for there is also the experimental work which
we shall consider in later chapters. When this also is taken
into account we can be confident in claiming that some para-
normal factor is often at work in the production ofmediumistic
material (just as we can be confident, though probably a shade
less so, that the same applies to the spontaneous phenomena).
To say this, however, is a very different thing indeed from
saying that that paranormal factor is the activity of the dis-
embodied

associated question of the future of this branch of psychical
research deserve a chapter to themselves.

THE QUESTION OF SURVIVAL
Whether we are to live in afuture state, as it is the most important
question which can possibly be asked, so it is the most intelligible one
which can be expressed in language.
BISHOP BUTLER, OfPersonal Identity
IN the last chapter we concluded that enough impressive
mediumistic mental phenomena had been produced under
sufficiently safeguarded conditions to demand, or at least to
justify, the assumption that some paranormal factor has some-
times been at work in their production. To put it more
precisely,
what is involved is this : some mediums and auto-
matists have given items of true information which they could
not have acquired by any normal means ; not even if they
were gifted with hyper-acute senses, masterly powers of
inference, or superlative memory capacity ; nor yet with any
combination of these, whether conscious or unconscious.
And these pieces ofinformation have been presented as deriv-
ing from people who have died : often they have been pre-
sented in the style, in the voice, and with the mannerisms of
those people ; and often again they have been things which
those people certainly did know when they were alive. Now
once it has been admitted or at least supposed for the sake of
argument that this information (and the associated character-
izations) cannot have been normally acquired (or provided)
by the medium or automatist (and of course that it cannot be
explained away as consisting only of lucky shots), it might
seem that there was no option but to put some sort of spiritu-
alist interpretation on the facts to say that this information
did indeed derive from "the spirits of the surviving dead."
In this chapter we are going to criticize this interpretation on
two levels :
first, taking it at its face value, by arguing that
even on this level it is not really as simple and as adequate to
the facts as at first sight it seems to be ; second, by suggesting,

survival.
Suppose then that we accept for the moment the survivalist
interpretation at its face value. It seems natural and straight-
forward. Whereas the attempt once the presence of
any paranormal factor has been conceded to describe the
phenomena alternatively in terms of the supposed telepathic
and/or clairvoyant (and/or possibly even precognitive) powers
of the medium or automatist and other living people must
seem strained and far-fetched. But this as was realized
early
in the history ofthe S.P.R., and not least acutely by some
of those like F. W. H. Myers who were most keen to prove
survival is a mistake. It seems natural and straightforward
to accept it because it is the interpretation which those medium-
istic
phenomena with which we are most familiar, so to speak,
put upon themselves ; and because we have not come across
any closely parallel phenomena which do not fit in with such
an interpretation. But there have been such parallel phe-
nomena. The survivalist account seems simple. But only
at first
sight : for quite apart from difficulties of the sort we
shall raise in the second half of this chapter it involves many
extra assumptions, mostly unsupported by independent evid-
dence, in addition to those required by the alternative account,
which are suggested by independent evidence. It is thus,
scientifically speaking, much more elaborate : and frustra fit

and the exceptions are of great theoretical importance. The
two groups of pre-nineteenth-century mediums or quasi-
mediums about whom we have most information, though
said to have performed many ofthe feats attributed to modern
mediums, did not ascribe their successes to the spirits of the
dead. The /caroxot of the later classical period perversely
gave credit to non-human gods or daemons ;
the witches of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries rashly confessed to
assistance from the devil. Incidentally, it is hard to see what
bearing the occurrence of paranormal physical phenomena
would have on the question ofsurvival. For unless there were
reason to think that death endows a
"
man
"
with powers of
levitating toy trumpets and so forth, such a performance could
scarcely even assist in authenticating the claim that "mess-

; In France where the Spiritualist cult is less widespread than
it is in the Anglo-Saxon world Dr. Osty tested a subject,
Mme. Morel, who produced under his supervision many true
items of information, both about the living and about the
dead, which were comparable in range and in
accuracy
with
the work of the best spirit mediums ; and the production
of which was equally inexplicable in normal terms. But she
did this without benefit of any Controls or Communi-
cators : and did not attribute her successes to spirit aid. Pre-
sumably with a different climate of opinion to mould her
development she would have become an orthodox spirit
medium : and in other environments perhaps a seer or a
prophetess or a
"
wise woman." (See

psychique, 1932-3, Dp. 80-3.)
Again, to parallel the proxy sittings, Osty reports that
another of his subjects, Mme. Peyroutel, on feeing asked to
describe the past life of a living person of whom he was
thinking, gave very distinctive details, which were quite
unknown to Osty, were not normally accessible to her, and
were later confirmed as correct by intimates of the person in

E. R. Dodds'
"
Why I do not Believe in Survival/' Proc.
S.P.R., Vol. XLII, to which and to whom I owe much else
besides. It is
only fair to add that it does not seem to me that
Osty's work, however sound his conclusions, was up to the
best S.P.R. standards.)
The vivid characterization by a medium in trance of a
person who was never normally known to her can also be
curiously paralleled. Dr. S. G. Soal whose statistical ESP
experiments will be mentioned later reports that at a
sitting with Mrs. Blanche Cooper a Communicator calling
"
himself" Gordon Davis appeared. But later much to his
surprise Soal discovered that his acquaintance Gordon Davis
had not, as he had previously believed, been killed in the war :
but was still alive and had, at the time of the sittings, been
practising as an estate agent in Southend. The voice of
"
Gordon Davis
"
was so apparently realistic that Soal
exclaimed
"
By Jove ! and it's like Gordon Davis too
"
: and
the turns of speech were later agreed by both Davis and Soal
to be characteristic. Most of the statements made by
"
Gor-
don Davis
"
were later found to fit Gordon Davis : the most
remarkable fact being that a description ofthe internal arrange-
ments of a house given by
"
him
"
fitted the actual arrange-
ments of the Davis home, into which he had not moved till
a year after the sittings with Mrs. Cooper. (" A Report on
some Communications Received through Mrs. Blanche
Cooper," Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXV; this particular case
pp. 560 ff.)
Even the features of the cross-correspondences, which
"
Myers
"
deliberately devised in order to remove or at
least to restrict the possibility of a description in terms ofthe
normal and paranormal capacities of the living only, have
some parallels which coulct only be fitted into a spiritualist
account very artificially. In many experiments in telepathy
the
"
receiver
"
seems to be groping near and for the idea the
"transmitter" has wished to convey. In one case the

wanted to produce Bishop, Miss Ramsden ended latme, Bishop

and the previous reference are both borrowed from Professor
E. R. Dodds' "Why I do not Believe in Survival," Proc.
S.P.R., Vol. XLII, to which and to whom I owe much else
besides. It is only fair to add that it does not seem to me that
Osty's work, however sound his conclusions, was up to the
best S.P.R. standards.)
The vivid characterization by a medium in trance of a
person who was never normally known to her can also be
curiously paralleled. Dr. S. G. Soal-whose statistical ESP
experiments will be mentioned later-reports that at a
sitting with Mrs. Blanche Cooper a Communicator calling
"himself" Gordon Davis appeared. But later-much to his
surprise-Soal discovered that his acquaintance Gordon Davis
had not, as he had previously believed, been killed in the war :
but was still alive and had, at the time of the sittings, been
practising as an estate agent in Southend. The voice of
" Gordon Davis " was so apparently realistic that Soal
exclaimed "By Jove! and it's like Gordon Davis too": and
the turns of speech were later agreed by both Davis and Soal
to be characteristic. Most of the statements made by " Gor-
don Davis " were later found to fit Gordon Davis : the most
remarkable fact being that a description ofthe internal arrange-
ments ofa house given by " him " fitted the actual arrange-
ments of the Davis home, into which he had not moved till
a year after the sittings with Mrs. Cooper. ("A Report on
some Communications Received through Mrs. Blanche
Cooper," Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXV; this particular case
pp. s6o ff.)
Even the features of the cross-correspondences, which
" Myers " deliberately devised in order to remove-or at
least to restrict...:....the possibility ofa description in terms ofthe
normal and paranormal capacities of the living only, have
some parallels which could only be fitted into a spiritualist
accolint very artificially. In many experiments in telepathy
the " receiver " seems to be groping near and for the idea the
"transmitter" has wished to convey. In one case-the
· Ramsden-Miles series-when Miss Miles wanted to send
Sphinx, Mis~ Ramsden recorded Luxor in Egypt, and when she
wanted to produce Bishop, Miss Ramsden ended latme, Bishor,
Latimer, Archbishop. In another case when a " transmitter '

was aJaintfeeling ofArabia or desert: a neat example of the sort
of disguised allusion attributed to Myers.

In a third case
especially interesting because two of the leading figures of the
cross-correspondence work were involved Dr. A. W. Ver-
rall wanted to infiltrate into his wife's automatic scripts the
three Greek words novoirajXov eV ao) (rendered as One-Horse
Dawn: which gave a name to the case). In the next six
months those scripts did in fact give just such a series of grop-
ing references as would have been scored as a cross-correspond-
ence if they had been occurring in the products of different
automatists. (They also had, on different occasions, separate
sentences which made sense only when put together. And
they even had one of those recondite allusive passages : Find
the herb moly, that will help it is a clue. The allusion was later
tracked down by Mrs. Verrall to another of the papers set in
the Cambridge Classical Tripos in the same year as that from
which her husband had culled the three enigmatic Greek
words.) (See Professor A. C. Pigou in Proc. S.P.JR., Vol.
XXIII, pp. 286 if.)
Besides such non-spiritualistic parallels to the marvels of
"
spirit
"
mediumship and automatism, there have been some
indications in the work of the best of these mediums and auto-
matists which point in the same direction. First, there are
cases where erroneous

seem to be most
plausibly described as based on
telepathy
from the sitter to the
medium. In the paper already referred to Soal reports that a
"John Ferguson appeared at sittings with Mrs. Blanche
Cooper, claiming to be a brother of a James Ferguson with
whom the investigator had been at school. Soal privately
invented various hypotheses about this putativeJohn Ferguson.
These were duly retailed to him as facts at later sittings. But
he was in the meantime ablk to prove that no such John
Ferguson had ever existed. Again at sittings with Mrs.
Piper, Hodgson one day thought about Sir Walter Scott:

Second, if we make the assumption that, other things being
equal, telepathy is more likely to occur between two people
when they are close together than when they are far apart,
then some results reported by Mr. H. F. Saltmarsh are sugges-
tive. (This assumption has a fair amount ofsupport ; though
nothing much can be said with assurance about what condi-
tions favour telepathy.) Saltmarsh found that in a series of
sittings, fifty-three ordinary and eighty-nine proxy, with
Mrs. Warren Elliott the percentage of true statements in the
former class was more than double what it was in the latter ;
while several Communicators who did well in ordinary
conditions made no score at all at proxy sittings. (" Report

Elliott," Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXIX.) Similar analysis has yet
to be applied to the recorded work of other outstanding

needing the presence of sympathetic loved ones would still
fit the facts.
Third, students of mediumistic communications have fre-
quently commented on their disjointedness : bits and pieces

a spiritualist account all this can be ascribed to the difficulties

fewer assumptions :
only that mediums sometimes show a
paranormal Faculty for the reality of which there is much
other evidence ;
and that they show it in a degree for which
there is some other evidence. The spiritualist account
demands, at least, that many human personalities survive
xleath (whatever precisely this may mean) in addition to the
existence of the powers postulated in the telepathic etc. (ESP)
account. If as usually is the case the spiritualist view is
extended to cover successful book-tests and object-reading,

as well as paranormal physical phenomena; then the tele-
pathic alternative is
equally capable ofparallel extension. For
the further powers which now have to be attributed to
"
the
spirits
"
could be ascribed to the medium and other people :
in each case there is evidence pointing to the display by people
making no spiritualist claims ofsuch a paranormal power. (See,
for instance, Chapter VIII for card-guessing under

the rival views certainly cannot be awarded the status of
explanations. To say that the paranormal element in a
stance is due to telepathy etc. between the various people
concerned is not at alllike saying that the co-ordination ofthe
elements in an armoured division is secured by radio telephony.
"
Telepathy
"
is not the name of a means ol communication ;
whereas the mention of radio telephony does explain how
certain results are achieved, by indicating the mechanisms
involved. Telepathy is no more an explanation of the para-
normal element in stance performances than memory is an
explanation of our
capacity
to give our names and addresses.
In this respect talk of
"
me spirits
"
is
certainly no better ;
in
spite of the explanatory pretensions with which it is often
introduced. For on this view
'*
the spirits
"
also have to be
"credited with all the still
mysterious paranormal powers,
which the alternative view attributes to people only ; further-
more, they must possess them to a far higher degree. For,
presumably, bodiless beings could not either acquire informa-
tion (some spirits have produced information not normally
available to their mediums about things that occurred after
the deaths of** their
"
namesakes) or convey it ; either to one
another, or, crucially, to the

spirit controls" manipulating
mediums: except

by ESP" (sensory communication is
ruled out by definition).
The postulation of surviving spirits might look plausible if
with the progress of research we found that the alternative
ESP account would have to attribute to people ESP capacities
considerably greater both than those for which we could find
evidence outside spiritist contexts and than those which the
spirit account needed to attribute to spirits. The first con-
dition would not be satisfied if we could then find any reason
why mediums and others should put up in spiritualist contexts
exceptionally good ESP performances ; but it would be if we
found that our ESP account would have to attribute to the
sitters ESP performances either under conditions which were
independently known to be inhibitory, or of which these
particular sitters were independently known to be incapable.
Once it was easier than it is now to believe that the first con-

able to give from memory were he still alive and well : hence
the desire to describe the seance by reference to the "spirit"
ofthe person in question. But even supposing
that the first two
conditions are met, the spiritist
account is still not going to be
more plausible than its rival : what it
gains on the ESP side,
by not having to allow for huge inexplicable increases in ESP
capacity in the single context of the stance, it loses elsewhere
by having to postulate a special faculty of brainless
memory,
possessed by its
postulated spirits.
This third condition mignt
be satisfied if all the efforts of the neurophysiologists and
psychologists failed to account for memory in neurophysio-
logical terms.

nothing is
definitely predictable. Or, to put it less mislead-
ingly: the concept of spirit is hopelessly indeterminate;
which is the main reason why the word
"
spirit
"
has no place
in the language of science (see p. 26).
Professor C. D. Broad's
"
psychic factor
"
theory is relevant
here. He has suggested, without very firm conviction, that
"
minds
"
might be
"
a compound of two factors, neither of
which separately has the characteristic properties of a mind,
just as salt is a compound of two substances neither of which
by itselfhas the characteristic properties ofsalt The psychic
factor would be like some chemical element which has never
been isolated ; and the characteristics of a mind would depend
jointly on those of the psychic factor and on those of the
material organism with which it is united" (loc. cit. 9 pp.
535-6). The analogy to a chemical compound would hold
in so far as
"
chemical compounds have properties which
cannot be deduced from those which their elements display
in isolation or in other compounds . . .
[although] ... the
properties of the compounds are wholly dependent on those
of the elements, in the sense that given such elements in such
relations, a compound necessarily arises with such and such
properties . . .
[which] ... do not belong to the elements,T>ut
only to the compound as a whole
"
(p. 536). But it would
break down in so far as when "two chemical elements are
united to form a chemical compound no permanent change is
produced in the properties of either . . .
[whereas] . . . when a
psychic factor is united with a bodily organism so as to give
a mind both factors may be permanently affected by this
union
"
(p. 536).
This sort ofview has two signal superiorities over spiritisms.
First: while the word "spirit" combines the minimum of
determinate meaning with the maximum of emotive disturb-
ance, the new term
"
psychic factor
"
can be given precisely
as much and what meaning we wish, and so far is sterile
emotionally. Broad was only willing to commit himself to

capacities
of their mortal namesakes or to enjoy any private
life and development between stances when they are not
married to any bodily factor. This squares with their
"singular reticence about their present life, characters, and
surroundings
"
(p. 5 40).
But, after allowing tor these advantages, this view is
surely
open to criticisms similar to those deployed against spiritisms.
It is as Broad of course saw (p. 538) more complex
than its ESP rival : for it
postulates a new class of entities,
psychic factors ;
and attributes to them that capacity of carry-
ing memory traces which is
usually considered the pre-
rogative of the brain ; while psychic factors will have to be
endowed with much the same ESP capacities as the rival inter-
pretation has to attribute to people. When Broad originally
developed this view it did have compensating advantages : for
he was writing before both the great advances in laboratory
ESP and the publication of much further work on medium-
ship suggesting that psychic factors would have to be credited
with considerable ESP powers as well as the possession ofmany
memory traces appropriate to their dead namesakes. But
the former have made it seem that we shall have in any case to
credit some people with considerable ESP capacity (see
Chapter VIII). While the latter have indicated that even
psychic
factors which, unlike spirits, do not have private
lives apart from stances, and so do not have to be credited with
enormous ESP powers on that account would haye to be
conceded considerable ones : since the Communicators of
entranced mediums sometimes produce information which
was not
normally
available either to the medium or to their
departed namesakes when alive (see above, p. 48). Broad

cases (see above, p. 65-6).
This brings us at last to the point where something can be
said about the future. With appropriate reserve, four points
may be made : First, it seems that the possibilities of what,
rather unfairly, might be called the
"

study of the psychology of mediums and their trance person-
alities have been at least temporarily pretty well exhausted :
though there is still considerable statistical work to be done
on the recorded material, in establishing and analysing the
72 TH~ QUESTION OF SURVIVAL
capacities of their mortal namesakes or to_ enjoy any private
life and development between seances when they are not
married to any bodily factor. This squares with their
" singular reticence about their present life, characters, and
surroundings" (p. 540). ·
But, after allowing for these advantages, this view is surely
open to criticisms similar to those deployed against spiritisms.
It is-as Broad of course saw (p. 538)-more complex
than its ESP rival : for it postulates a new class of entities,
psychic factors; and attributes to them that capacity ofcarry-
ing memory traces which is usually considered the pre-
rogative of the brain; while psychic factors will have to be
endowed with much the same ESP capacities as the rival inter-
pretation has to attribute to people. When Broad originally
developed this view it did have compensating advantages : for
he was writing before both the great advances in laboratory
ESP and the publication of much further work on medium-
ship suggesting that psychic factors would have to be credited
with considerable ESP powers as well as the possession ofmany
memory traces appropriate to their dead namesakes. But
the former have made it seem that we shall have in any case to
credit some people with considerable ESP capacity (see
Chapter VIII). While the latter have indicated that even
psychic factors-which, unlike spirits, do not have private
lives apart from seances, and so do not have to be credited with
enormous ESP powers on that account-would have to be
conceded considerable ones : since the Communicators of
entranced mediums sometimes produce information which
was not normally available either to the medium or to their
departed namesakes when alive (see above, p. 48). Broad
was writing, too, before Soal's "Gordon Davis" and "John

marsh's work on the sittings of Mrs. Warren Elliott), and in
applying newly perfected techniques of assessment ; and it is
worth while to go on accumulating more material against the
day when developments elsewhere will throw fresh light on
it. The future lies in using more dynamic techniques :
already we have stressed the desirability of following up Mr.
Whately Carington's initiative by applying standard psycho-
logical tests. (It might conceivably also be interesting if one
or two mediums could be psychoanalysed.)
Second, in spite of the unimpressive results achieved so far,
it would be worth trying with improved technique and more
extensively
the method of test
questions ; especially as it de-
mands little time or effort and promises big returns. The basic
idea is that before they die people should settle on some item
ofinformation, known only to themselves, which they intend
to try to communicate after death : the hope being that if this
were achieved fairly often it would provide an almost knock-
down proof of survival ; for it would be far harder though
not necessarily impossible to produce an alternative account
in terms of paranormal transactions among the living. The
usual technique has been to deposit in a bank or with the S.P.R.
a sealed envelope containing some object or message. This
has two flaws : first, that even if the correct information was
duly provided, this achievement could be attributed to clair-
voyance by the medium ; second, that once the seal is broken
the experiment is finished, and so even if the depositor had
actually survived, his plan might be frustrated by bogus
attempts or by his own preliminary failures. Dr. R. H.
Thouless has now suggested an improved technique : this is to
deposit an enciphered message to which the depositor has to
supply the key after he is dead ; the correct key will reveal a
meaning in the cipher passage; whereas bogus and abortive
attempts will not wreck the test. This technique is
quite
simple : and if others will follow Thouless's lead, those who
survive (in the ordinary way) can but await the results (sec

conclusions. They have not. It is rather that they seem nearly
all to have been so gripped by the seance set-up and so en-
thralled by the enormous not necessarily or to everyone
attractive possibility of survival that whatever answers they
have given their questions have nearly always been spiritualist
questions.
Fourth, one of the best hopes of advance here (as elsewhere
in psychical research) lies in the experimental ESP work.
The hope is that this may reveal what favours, what inhibits,
and what are the limits of ESP capacity (i.e. telepathy cum
clairvoyance, whether retrocognitive, precognitive, or simul-
taneous). And consequently that the experimentally acquired
knowledge will
steadily provide justification (or perhaps not)

survivalism. The gist is that it is not clear what such a theory
will mean. Logically this question should be prior to those
raised so far ; but it is so surprising as to justify a roundabout
approach. For surely Butler is
right? Can we not under-
stand the hopes of the warriors of Allah who expect if they
die in Holy War to go straight to the arms of the black-eyed
houris in Paradise? Can we not understand the fears of the
slum mother kept from the contraceptive clinic by her priest's
warnings of penalties for those who die in mortal sin ? Or
even the hopes of a Myers or a Sidgwick? Of course we
can : it would be a preposterous piece of over-sophistication
to fail to understand such fears and hopes, and to discount
their possible power and influence. 1

that we might survive this dissolution seems like suggesting
that a nation might outlast the annihilation of all its members.
Certainly we can understand the promises of Paradise, the
threats of Hell, the brave stories ot Valhalla. But to expect
that after my death and dissolution such things might happen
to me is to overlook that I shall not then exist, ex hypothesi.
To expect such things, through overlooking this, is
surely
like
accepting a fairy tale as history, through ignoring the prefatory
rubric

Of course the insinuations of the sceptic are as slick and
crude as they are unfair. But they can serve to throw into
relief two easily and often neglected but crucial points.
First, that the essence of doctrines of
personal
survival (or
immortality) and this alone is what gives them their huge
human interest is that they should assert that we shall exist
after our deaths (for ever). It is thus, and
only thus, that they
can provide the basis for expecting that we shall have
"

after death, that with death things for us will not cease,
but change. For nothing can happen to us then unless there
is still an us for it to happen to. Second, that person-
words mean what they do mean. Words such as you/'
"I," "person," "people," "woman," "man," "Flew"
though very different in their particular functions are all used
to refer in one way or another to objects (the pejorative
flavour ofthis word should here be discounted) which you can
point at, touch, hear, see, and talk to. Person-words refer to
people. And how can such objects as
people survive physical
dissolution? This is a massive difficulty, and the need to
evade or remove it has provided the conscious or unconscious
driving force for many intellectual manoeuvres :
First, there have been attempts to show that person-words
have at most a contingent, and not a necessary reference to
objects : that is to say that people as a matter offact (which
might have been, and may one day be otherwise) inhabit,
or are otherwise closely associated with, their bodies ; but that
the reference to objects is no part of the meaning of person-
words. These attempts have usually appeared as arguments
that people are inexplicably compounded of two elements,
body and soul (the latter sufficiently elusive and insubstantial

to be a plausible candidate for survival after dissolution) ; and
that the soul is the real or essential person. This last equa-
tion is crucial : for unless I am my soul, the immortality (or
survival) of my soul will not be my immortality ; and the
news of the immortality (or future survival) of my soul
would be of no more concern to me than the news that my
appendix would be preserved eternally in a bottle. In

duty for the less secular

soul."

avoids this

surely to
jump from the frying-pan of logical difficulty into the fire of
factual indefensibility.
Third, whether or not talk of people surviving dissolution
is, according to current usage, self-contradictory (whether or
not person-words refer to objects which could not significantly
be said to survive physical dissolution), it has been argued
that we can attach sense to talk of spirits surviving physical
dissolution. We can : but the difficulty is to attach a sense
such that this talk will, if true, justify us in nourishing expecta-
tions of experiences, instead of oblivion, after our deaths. It
is in their present use with its essential reference to certain
objects one can point at (viz. people) that person-words
carry their crucial implications ; that personal identity is the
necessary condition of both accountability and expectation.

only to say that it is
unjust to reward or punish

is the same person as did the deed ;

going to be someone who will be the same person as I. The
problem is to change the meaning ofperson-words so radically
that it becomes significant to talk of people surviving dissolu-

This is not a clearly hopeless task, but it
certainly is far
harder than, and partly of a different kind from, what is often
thought. It is not clearly hopeless because people though
objects are objects of a very remarkable kind :
people un-
like things have

private experiences

feelings, sensations,
and so forth ;
and particular people have a large range of, so to
speak, separable characteristics knowledge of this and that,
such-and-such peculiar mannerisms, and so on. And while
people the objects we can point at cannot conceivably sur-
vive physical dissolution, private experiences might perhaps be
significantly said to occur disembodied; and some of the
characteristics we have been accustomed to associate with
particular people could conceivably be, and in fact sometimes
actually are, manifested in the absence of those people those
objects we could once have pointed at. These two peculiar-
ities of people as objects suggest that the task is not hopeless.
But it is far harder than it
might seem. For our language
and this of course applies just as much to person-words and all
the other words we use in our discourse about persons, as to
the words for material tilings has been evolved as an instru-
ment for dealing with the situations in which men have found
themselves : for the situations of this world. When we try
as we are trying when we want to speak of people surviving
death to use it for dealing with radically different conditions
it breaks down. It begins to play tricks on us in all sorts of
subtle and unexpected ways. For so many words which one
might think to transfer easily to
descriptions
of putative spirit
beings involve covert but essential reference to the corporeal.
This fact is concealed from us by (and is doubtless also partly
the cause of) our tendency tacitly, or even explicitly, to take
spirit existence to be some sort of desubstantialized replica of
the world we live in. Spirit cigars and astral trousers have
often been derided. It is almost impossible to realize that our

that any person knows very well when he has a feeling that

precisely this,
whether any sense can be given to talk of disembodied people,

"

and
associated terms and expressions would also be partly of an
unexpected kind. For if the existence of disembodied people
in the sense to be specified is to be a doctrine of survival, is to
justify living people (" people

in the old sense) in expecting
experiences after death, then it will have to make sense to talk
ofa disembodied person (new or extended sense of
"
person ")
being the same person as some former person (ordinary sense
of

"
)
. And this will demand a change in the meaning
of

: since a disembodied person, a spirit,
cannot be the same person as an (ordinary) person, in the
present sense of "same person"; for, to speak very dog-
matically, the meaning and the criteria of this expression in-

person in question ;
and ex vi termini this cannot apply to the
case ofa disembodied spirit. We shall have both to produce a
sense of
"
same person" which could do the trick, and to
provide a convincing quasi-legal argument for thus changing
the use of that expression.
This is a difficult business :
perhaps an analogy would make
things clearer. Constantly courts are confronted with per-
plexing issues which take the form of questions ;
but which
are not so much questions asking for answers as demands

course, it is and yet it isn't : but the court has to decide one
way or the other. The problem arises because an attempt is
being made to use a word in a situation with which it was
never designed to cope. A law which was passed before
flying-boats were thought of has been contravened (or has
it?) by a

that someone might or might not be in pain or might or
might not be having a mental image. There would be no
contradiction in asserting the behavioural evidence and denying
its usual experiential correlate. Consider the nightmare case,
borrowed from Professor John Wisdom, of the man who says
to a patient being wheeled into the operating theatre :
"
You 11
make no sound, no movement, and afterwards you will
remember nothing :
but, in spite of the anaesthetic, you'll feel
it all." Or the reports ofpeople after cataleptic trances saying
that their experience was continuous, though they had
appeared oblivious, which provoked Edgar Allan Poe's
tormented tales of burial alive.
Now Price's account of his image beings avoids the cruder
errors of purporting to describe disembodied existence while
surreptitiously reintroducing bodies. No mean achieve-
ment : for even Plato when speaking supposedly of the life
of incorporeal souls disembodied by death describes their
fortunes in precisely the terms of a (corporeal) adventure ;
as
when he sees (sic)
souls under physical tortures, which only
(corporeal) people could suffer (see Republic, X). But Price
still assumes that simply by providing this account he has
shown that conceivably we might become such beings after
death, that death for us might be a metamorphosis from a
substantial to an insubstantial mode of existence. Whereas
as we have argued it is still
necessary to show that it
would be reasonable, if certain conditions were satisfied, to
decide that particular incorporeal beings could be identified
with, could be said to be the same persons as, particular
human beings. The word
"
decide
"
is crucial: the present
meanings of our person-words and expressions are adapted to
the needs and facts of this world ;
and we cannot extend them
to cover the radically different possibilities of another world
without, tacitly or explicitly, deciding to make drastic altera-
tions in their use, their meanings. This may sound a tortuous
method of remaking a trivial point. But the point only
sounds trivial in the context of a speculative discussion, where
it is
always open to us so to arrange our suppositions about
possible beings that it would be obviously reasonable to extend
our notions of person and personal identity to include these.

should not want to decide, even in the light ofthe fullest know-
ledge, that a particular insubstantial being either was or was not
Myers. Price, by speaking about what it
might be like for us
to be incorporeal beings, takes these vital decisions for granted.
He seems momentarily to have overlooked that in questions
about personal identity even the honest testimony of that
person does not necessarily provide the last word, as it does
where the issue is whether or not someone is in pain. He
writes,
* *
And surely the important question is what constitutes
my personal identity for myself" (p. 10). But Capone either
is or is not the one who led the gang : he cannot be one thing
for himself and another for other people-, though some (usually
but not always including himself; memory is not infallible) may
be in the secret, while others are not. It is because this is so,
because it is
possible to be mistaken as to whether one did or
suffered something, whereas it makes no sense to talk of being
mistaken as to whether one is now in pain, that one cannot
get around these points about decision issues by, as it were,
appealing to a possible incorporeal being
"
himself" (or itself)
to settle expertly whether or not
"
he
"
(or it) is
Myers.

(Unless, of course, one is
prepared
to abdicate the decision
itselfto the
"
spirits
"
: which is itselfa decision ;
and a very poor
one.)
The argument of this chapter has been of two quite differ-
ent, but interrelated, kinds : first about the possible inter-
pretations of facts, and then about the meanings of words.
First, we indicated the lines on which apparently strong
evidence for survival might be interpreted more simply in
terms of telepathy etc. among living people only : this is a
type ofargument long familiar, at least to psychical researchers.

To bring out this difficult point, consider two fantastic examples :
suppose a person P split like an amoeba into two identical people Pj
and P2
both claiming to be P and both having the
"
memories
"
appro-
priate to and all other characteristics of the original person before his
great divide : and suppose two incorporeal beings both claimed to be
Myers, and both displayed the appropriate characteristics and
"
memories." Here testimony, albeit honest, could not be the last
word : unless we are willing to say that in this case two things which
are the same as a third can be different from one another ; as we might
indeed decide to do. (See my

Second, we tried to show that there are serious difficulties
involved in giving sense to talk of spirits
and their survival :
this line ofargument is not yet nearly so familiar, even to those
who devote themselves to this subject. The crux is not that
our possible future life would be so different from anything
we know that we cannot hope to describe or imagine it : but
that these spirits,
if we gave determinate meaning to this term,
might, precisely because of their incorporeality, be so differ-
ent from what we now mean by
"
people
"
that we could not
identify them with people who had once lived, even though
they might possess peculiar knowledge and other character-
istics reminiscent of our dead friends.

why the same experiments when repeated by equally honest
and competent investigators do not always yield tne same
results is that in our present ignorance of favouring and
inhibiting conditions something crucial is overlooked. The
experiments are not really identical.
Experiment began in England very early in the history of
psychical research; and at one time or another various, but
predominantly positive and often impressive findings were
reported by a variety of workers in several countries.
But the great landmark was the publication by Pro-
fessor J. B. Rhine and various colleagues at Duke
University, North Carolina, of a book called Extra-Sensory
Perception. This gave enormous impetus to experiment,
particularly to the
"
quantitative
"
type favoured by Rhine.
Since then an immense amount of further work has been done
at Duke, in many other universities, and elsewhere. A
Journal of Parapsychology is devoted entirely to these experi-
ments; and the publications ofthe older societies have become
more and more preoccupied with them.
Earlier experiments took various forms, but now the
statistically assessable "quantitative" pattern developed at
Duke is
generally followed. The fundamental idea is this :
the experimenter takes a pack of so-called Zener cards ;
a
special pack consisting of five suits of five identical cards, the
designs being simple and sharply different from one another,
viz. Circle, Star, Cross (or Plus), Square, and Wavy Lines (or
Waves). The pack is shuffled (though often more elaborate
and sophisticated devices than ordinary hand shuffling are used
to get the cards into a random series). The Subject has to
guess at least one complete pack, a series of twenty-five cards,
before he is told if he ever is which and how many guesses
were right and which and how many were wrong. Usually
an Agent, who is sometimes the Experimenter, turns up ana
looks at each target card in turn while the subject guesses : but
sometimes not, in which case the subject guesses right down
through the pack, or actually makes his guesses before the
pack has even been shuffled into the order he has to guess ;
and then no one at all knows the answers until the scores are
checked. Precautions are taken to make sure that the subject,

Sometimes (but not to
my mind often enough) mechanical
scoring devices are used to eliminate the possibility ofmotivated
slips in recording the guesses and counting the hits. Now,
granting that the precautions are adequate, one would expect
that subjects on average over a long run of guesses would tend
to score five right out of twenty-five, since the pack consists of
five suits of five identical cards.
But in fact it is found that many subjects have, in test after
test, in spite of all
precautions taken against deliberate or
unconscious cheating, guessed right not merely the average
of five times out of twenty-five, which is what would have
been expected from chance selection ; but significantly more
often than this, six, seven, or even eight times out of twenty-
five ; and this on average over large numbers of tests. The
results with many subjects are statistically significant: more,

that these results reveal the presence of a paranormal factor,
a capacity for extra-sensory perception (ESP). This is a

PARANORMAL BEHAVIOUR 87
Zener cards are of course not compulsory, though they do
have the merit of simplifying the probability calculations;
and proper precautions have not by any means always been
taken to eliminate normal factors. But the important thing
to stress here is that everything depends on probability cal-
culations : no one scores 100 per cent hits; the ESP
factor is revealed only in statistically significant devia-
tions from mean chance expectation. This carries three
corollaries :
first, that any advanced study demands fairly
elaborate mathematics, though the basic ideas are simple
enough ; second, that the issue always hinges on the correct-
ness of a small proportion of the total number of guesses
made, so even tiny and sporadic gaps in the precautions can
totally invalidate a series ; third, that a large number ofguesses
has to be made to get any results at all, while all
guesses have
to be recorded if the result is to be reliable.
As to the first of these corollaries, two points mustbe stressed.
One is that the mathematics of the best work has been com-
petently and exhaustively vetted : Rhine was cleared by the
American Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 1937; in
EnglandProfessor R. A. Fisher, whowrote the standard textbook
on statistical methods for research workers, has constantly and
generously helped with advice and criticism ; so if some crucial
flaw has remained undiscovered a great deal of work in more
conventional fields is also likely to be equally invalid. This
last is a
possibility
which should be mentioned ; for whereas
it is unthinkable that a crude error getting the sums wrong
could have remained undiscovered, it is at least possible tnat
some sophisticated flaw may still be concealed in relevant
parts of accepted probability theory ;
or that there may be
some relevant discovery to be made about the concept of
randomness. But not being able to spot anything of this sort
we can only mention this possibility, and then proceed
temporarily on the assumption that it will not be realized.
The other point is that as we have already argued in Chapter
III- one must never forget that the calculi of mathematics, like
sausage machines, cannot turn out results better than the in-
gredients which are fed into them. No amount of valid
mathematical reasoning will be of any avail to demonstrate
a paranormal factor unless the precautions to exclude normal

above mean chance expectation must be taken to have and
to be significant of some normal, even if rather recherche,
explanation. Carington tells the mischievous story of the
great Karl Pearson, who once argued that

paper called Monaco, which purported to record the results
of every spin, week by week : and overlooked that the re-
porter from this journal might have been finding the life of
the cafe more congenial than the wearying tensions of the
casino.
The second corollary was that the proportion of the total
of all guesses on which the entire argument depends is small.
Steady scoring of six or seven right out of twenty-five is
very
significant indeed, and the odds against its
occurring by chance
alone are monstrous. But if only one or two a small pro-
portion oftwenty-five ofthese six or seven correct guesses are
invalid, the product of some sort of cheating or recording
error, then the case for a paranormal factor collapses : for
the remaining five hits are no more than mean chance
expectation.
The third corollary that large numbers of guesses arc
essential if there are to be any results at all, entails both that
doing the experiments must tend to be monotonous, and that
all

The former point may be important, because interest or bore-

the vigilance of investigators ; but the latter is
certainly vital,
because the whole point of these repetitive procedures is
precisely that they alone enable the experimenter to calculate

Well,
that's a good run of hits : we'll stop now before he spoils his

These are important points to bear in mind. But let me say
immediately and emphatically that it seems to me and to
almost everyone else who has seriously examined the evidence
that in the best work the precautions have been adequate,
while the probability calculations seem to be faultless, and
there is no reason to doubt the integrity or conscientiousness
of the workers involved : and that there has been sufficient
work ofthis highest standard yielding overwhelmingly signifi-
cant positive results to establish the reality of some unfamiliar
factor. There has been a great deal of work in which
the precautions have not been adequate (much of the work
at Duke, for instance) ;
but this cannot undermine the case for
ESP, which rests on the best work, done there and elsewhere.
Many experiments, including several of the present card-
guessing type, have yielded only negative results: but this
does not invalidate the case that some (not all) people some-
times (not always] display ESP capacity. The evidence of the
best series yielding positive results is to my mind most
convincingly supported by
two facts : that odd, unexpected,
and at present inexplicable, uniformities are cropping up
independently in different laboratories, and that some data
recorded by earlier workers who reported only negative
findings has revealed unnoticed positive significance when
analysed again in the light of later findings, and with better
statistical techniques.
In short, the proportion and the degree of significance of
positive results reported by different workers in rigorous
conditions is now far too great to permit the judgment that
the whole business has been a wild-goose chase, an exercise in
sophisticated superstition. Dr. Thouless has put this point
about the degree of significance picturesquely. In the Soal-
Goldney experiments on Shackleton (which we shall go on
to, describe) the odds against chance were io35
(ten with
thirty-five noughts after it) to one. To reduce this figure
to insignificance we should have to be able to set against it a
greater number of ESP experiments with negative results
than there has been time for in the history of the world : it

only hope ofdiscrediting the results is to attack the precautions
taken by the experimenters and/or the integrity of all con-
cerned. But in the case of the crucial experiments, such as
the Soal-Goldney work on Shackleton ana the Pratt-Wood-

objection brought by lay critics and also all those raised by the
experience of earlier experimenters. Soal is

when he and Mrs. Goldney exploited the chance ofusing Mrs.
Eileen Garrett as a subject : she had worked for Rhine and
Pratt at Duke; but Soal had to report,

only fair to add that Rhine had reported that her scoring

But thenWhately Carington (not to be confused with his

noticed that sometimes his own subjects scored significantly
not on the proper target but on the one immediately before
or after, recommended him to look for a similar
"
displace-
ment effect." Soal went back, sceptically, to analyse all his
records again ; and found that two, and only two, of all his
subjects had been scoring quite definitely above chance in
both directions.
He therefore began a fresh series ofexperiments with one of
these two, Basil Shackleton. These were done in two
adjoining rooms : the agent sat at a table in one, with one
experimenter sitting opposite; the subject and the other
experimenter were similarly disposed in the other room. The
intervening door was left ajar ;
but the two pairs of people
were so placed that they could not have seen one another even
had it been wide open. The cards were placed in a box in

a coloured picture ofa creature a Lion, an Elephant, a Zebra,
a Giraffe, and a Pelican : the reasons for this variation were
simply that it was impossible to get new special packs printed
during the war, while Soal was understandably reluctant ever
to see a Zener card again. These five cards were shuffled be-
fore each group of fifty guesses, and then laid face downwards
in a row in the box in front ofthe agent. Opposite the agent,
separated by an intervening screen with a small square hole in
it, sat an experimenter with in front of her (it
was usually
Mrs. Goldney) five cards bearing the numbers I to 5. This
experimenter was provided at the beginning of each group of
fifty guesses with a random series of fifty numbers : these
lists were prepared by Soal in advance, and concealed from

look at the sheet of numbers and then hold up to the hole in
the screen the card bearing the number next on the list. The
agent then picked up and looked at the corresponding card in
the row in the box, replacing it
again face downwards. The
point of all this was to ensure that the agent's experimenter
should not know the value of the target card : since she had to
speak during the experiment which of course the agent was
never allowed to do and might somehow have given away
clues when she told the subject to make his next guess, which
he did by writing down on a special printed scoring sheet the
initial letter of the name of the creature he guessed. At the
end of each series of
fifty guesses the cards in front of the
agent were turned up : tne information as to which number
corresponded to which creature was then entered on the
scoring sheet. The score sheets plus the appropriate list of
random numbers then enabled the scores to oe worked out.
In some of the experiments the card to be looked at by the
agent was chosen by one of the experimenters selecting by
touch a counter from a bag or bowl which contained equal
numbers of counters in five different colours. The point of
this was to introduce a human element into the selection.
Cross-checks were always made by comparing the column
of guesses with a column of targets at which it had not been
aimed to make sure that the relations of these were not
significant. These cross-checks which were negative in
their results served as the control experiment. At most
sessions, including several of those with the most striking
results, some independent observer was present,
sometimes
someone whose integrity and shrewdness it would be laugh-
able to question. Professor H. H. Price and Mr. (now Pro-
fessor) C. A. Mace both did this
job and testified to the rigour
of the conditions. The precautions taken in checking the
scores were equally severe. The whole series has been written
up so exhaustively that there need be no doubt as to what
precisely the conditions were on any particular occasion.
For Soal and Goldney were not so spellbound by Shackleton's
performance that

of calling, the proportion of precognitive (+ i) hits was

course refer to Seal's original reports.
The first case was of experiments on a single star per-
former using restricted target material five sorts of cards.
The second is of work on an unselected group with a variety
of target material. This was done by Mr. Whately Caring-
ton, assisted by a special S.P.R. committee consisting of Pro-
fessor C. D. Broad, Professor H. H. Price, and Dr. R. H.
Thouless. Carington devoted immense effort and ingenuity
to this in the hopes ofdevising an experiment which would give
positive results under rigorous conditions with any group of
subjects anywhere. This hope seems to have been dis-
appointed in the event : for similar though not identical
experiments made since both in the U.S.A. and in this
country
have failed to give the same effects. But Carington's methoos
and results are nevertheless interesting. The method was for
the experimenter to draw a picture, and pin it to a bookcase in
his study at 7 p.m. leaving it till 9.30 a.m. the following morn-
ing : the subject of each day's picture was selected by a routine
designed to eliminate bis idiosyncrasies and secure random-
ness. The subjects were told to reproduce the target picture
at any time during the period while it was exposed. The
experimenter kept his study locked, with opaque curtains
drawn, while the drawing was exposed ;
and locked all draw-
ings away in a steel box as soon as they were taken down.
The subjects were given a book of printed forms for their
drawings : to arouse interest this was accompanied by a photo
ofthe experimenter's study ; which point was later thought by
him to have been of critical importance. They drew their
pictures in their own homes ; which were often in different
towns from the targets. The unit was a series of ten succes-
sive tests taking ten days. The final method ofjudging and
assessing results was delightfully ingenious. Every drawing
was marked with a code number by means of which it
could be known at which target it had been aimed. The
drawings were then shuffled up and sent to an independent
judge, together with the ten target pictures shuffled separately.
His job was to say which drawings he thought resembled a
target picture: without knowing the code, and hence not
knowing what was aimed at what. So far of course the

scoring would depend partly on the quirks of the judge.
The next move was to separate the drawings he had counted
as likenesses :
subdividing them according to which target they
were supposed to resemble. Suppose one target had been a
matchbox and twenty-five drawings out of, say, a thousand,
rated as likenesses were of matchboxes. And assume,
modestly, that all these thousand likenesses were chance ones.
Then we can say that, if only chance were involved, twenty-
five out of a thousand hits could be expected on any particular
target.
But on the same assumptions this same proportion
of hits should occur in any subdivision of a series, as well as
over the whole. So there should only have been the same
proportion (2\ per cent) ofhits whenthe target was a matchbox.
Having done this with all ten groups of drawings scored as
likenesses, it is
possible to calculate whether the actual devia-
tions from chance expectation were significant. The method
is most elegant. Dealing with Zener cards which restrict the
choice to five equiprobable alternatives we know in advance
what the probabilities of chance success are, but with picture
targets we do not know this beforehand. So we make the
material itself tell us afterwards what they were. The judge's
idiosyncrasies neatly cancel one another out : his leniency or
severity
in allowing resemblances will be shown equally when
a matchbox was and when it was not the target ;
for he is
kept
in the dark as to what was aimed at what. While the method
of selecting at random what was to be drawn ensured that any
tendencies the subjects might have to draw what happened to
interest them most would not help. Though Carington also
guarded against this by making cross-checks by scoring, also
with independent judges, sets of drawings against the wrong
series of targets :
getting only negative results in these control
experiments.
At first Carington thought he was getting only negative
results in the main experiments as well as in the controls,
but then he began to notice that though scores on the target
itself were not notably significant, there was a tendency
for
"
near-misses
"
to cluster round it. What seemed to be
happening was this :
suppose the target on one day was a ham,
then the tendency for the subjects to draw hams rose to a peak
at or around that day, and then declined. He followed up this

It was this that prompted him to persuade the sceptical Soal to
look for displacement effects in the scores of his 160 subjects :
and thus led to the discovery of the two prize performers,
Gloria Stewart and Basil Shackleton.
The third case is the work of Mr. G. N. M. Tyrrell : this
illustrates the use of mechanical selection and scoring devices ;
but Tyrrell had the luck to find another star subject (and,
whatever may be the case in the U.S.A., these in England are
excessively rare) : a Miss G. M. Johnson who seemed to have
a remarkable flair for finding lost objects. Instead of trying
possibly uncongenial card tests, he devised an apparatus
specially to suit this bent. The basic
principle
was that the
subject had to lift the lid of whichever DOX of a set of five she
guessed to contain the target : thus the element offinding was
introduced without in any way complicating the probability
calculations. In the developed form of the apparatus the
boxes contained small electric lamps, each of which could be
lit
by the pressing of a key by an operator concealed from the
subject : and the totals, but not the details, of trials and suc-
cesses were automatically recorded on a tape, thus eliminating
recording and scoring errors. Various refinements were
introduced from time to time to meet criticisms or to
vary
the conditions. To eliminate the danger that the operator s
number preferences might be helping the subject, mechanical
and other devices were used to ensure randomness of target
selection. To achieve
"

"
conditions a special
switch was introduced, which crossed the wires from the
keys to the lamps in such a way that the operator did not
know which lamp would be lit by which key. To give
"
precognitive
"
conditions a delayed-action device was used
so that the target lamp did not light up till the guess had been
made: in combination with the special switch this set the
scene for
"
precognitive clairvoyance." In all these various
conditions, in spite of the added refinements of precaution,
and with several different operators, Miss Johnson continued
to achieve significant scores.

as usual, add a couple of cautionary tales. The scene of

First German War. A large endowment not lightly
to be
refused had been given for psychical research : the distaste-
ful duty fell to Dr. Coover. As his main work he got a

conditions:
a total often thousand guesses. His conclusion was

(Experiments in
Psychic Research, Stan-
ford University Publications, 1917 :
quotations at pp. 123 and

significant difference between scores under the alternative
conditions. His recorded results were later analysed again by
Dr. R. H. Thouless and found to justify no such categorical
negative (Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XLIII, pp. 25 ff.).
For when the
scores unaer both conditions were added together the odds
against chance were found to be 200 to i : which is consider-
ably above
any usually accepted standard of significance.
Furthermore, though Coover himself by adopting the rigor-
ous requirement that he would not count anything less than
50,000 to i
against as significant was able to conclude that
his results were negative, apparently he failed to notice that
even this demand would have been met, granted the same rate
of scoring, had the total number of guesses been rather more
than doubled. He also neglected to give further tests to find
whether his high-scoring subjects could maintain their per-
formance under more rigorous conditions. This work has
often been quoted as indicating that ESP tests by a really
competent, conscientious, and sceptical researcher will yield
only negative results. It most certainly does not even tend to
prove this : and might have counted more than it does in
favour ofthe reality ofESP had Coover only gone on, tighten-
ing the precautions to ensure that the significant results were
significant not merely ofweaknesses in the experimental set-up.
"
Coover's failure to go on is," as Thouless moderately
observes,
"
remarkable." On the other hand, it is not fair
not to mention and Thouless fails to bring this out that

which the ESP experimenter has to guard. Coover's work
illustrates the dangers of " optional stopping " (Roughly :
stopping a statistical inquiry at the point which suits your own
PARANORMAL BEHAVIOUR 99
prepossessions) ; Soal's shows how sensory clues and cues may
be unwittingly given and unconsciously exploited, producing
a bogus ESP effect. But each moral story has a twist : for
the former shows that bias and statistical
malpractices are not
the prerogative of protagonists of ESP ; while the latter
suggests how very unlikely it is that Soal would have over-
looked any line of leakage in the work on Stewart and
Shackleton.
But the three summaries of pieces of experimental work
and the two two-edged warning examples are not, of course,
intended as sufficient proof of the genuineness of the ESP
effects mentioned : and only a very gullible person would
accept them as such. They have been selected primarily as
samples ofdifferent kinds ofstatistically assessable investigation
and as examples of certain pitfalls : which together may both
indicate the major characteristics of the work and suggest the
way it is
likely to develop.
The first point here is mat for almost all
purposes work on
star subjects is far more promising than work on more or less
unselected masses. The disadvantages of such aggregations
are many. For instance, if they do contain any good per-
formers the scores of these tend to be swamped by those of
the others who show little or no ESP capacity, and thus
there is
only a very weak effect to study ; while the effect even
with prize performers can scarcely be called strong. If they
do not contain any good performers then all the great labour
is lost : often mass experiments even those in which members
have been selected as likely candidates have been wholly
negative (for instance, one done by Soal in 1929). Again
peculiar quirks like the tendency sometimes shown by good
performers in bad moods to show highly significant negative
scores (constantly missing in a way that suggests that ESP
capacity
is
being used to ensure failure) may be concealed :
either because idiosyncrasies are swamped in the crowd; or
because opposite peculiarities cancel one another out. But
mass experiments have their place both as a means offinding
star subjects (this was how Soal found his), and in the efforts
to correlate performance with psychological type (in America
Dr. Betty Humphrey, Dr. Gertrude Schmeidler and others
have tried not without success to do this).

star subjects (this was how Soal found his), and in the efforts
to correlate performance with psychological type (in America
Dr. Betty Humphrey, Dr. Gertrude Schmeidler and others
have tried-not without success-to do this).

The second point is that once star subjects have been found
and not everyone
has Rhine's luck in this respect full
advantage must oe taken of them. In the past there has been
a tendency just to watch spellbound so that the upshot has
often been merely to confirm that ESP is a reality or not even
that. The moral is that anyone who is or finds a star per-
former should get into touch with people already working in
the field so that a precious subject is not wasted in fruitless
repetition of work already done and amply confirmed. This
is
doubly important because the powers of several star per-
formers in the past have declined fast : not just those or the
fake performers whose powers have withered in test condi-
tions, but those of the
genuine
ones.
Third surely this should not have to be said conditions
must always be so rigorous that
every experiment other than
purely exploratory ones published as such does provide
further confirmation of the reality of ESP. Otherwise pro-
gress will be hampered by (justified) mistrust pf the com-
petence of the experimenters : and by a crop of new, but
bogus, ESP effects. Many workers think that experimenters
should always work in pairs, and welcome visitors, within
reason. To insist on this degree of rigour in all ESP work is
not to insist that every new experiment should be one de-
signed to demonstrate the reality of ESP. That has been done
already : those who are not yet convinced will be impressed,
if at all, by advancing knowledge about it rather man by
further demonstrations ofthe fact ofits occurrence, unwelcome,
brute, and isolated.
Fourth, the two things which workers are always hoping
to achieve and we take them together because they are prob-
ably interdependent are repeatability and stronger effects.
The more we learn about tne conditions which favour and
inhibit ESP performance the greater the hope of eliminating
that great scandal of ESP work : the fact that even the same
subject in apparently identical conditions cannot be relied on
to
perform consistently well, or even consistently badly. But
Rhine makes the point that, since ESP performance seems to
be connected with psychological factors such as interest, bore-
dom, and enthusiasm, both of the subjects and of the experi-
menters, experiments never can be exactly repeated in all

PARANORMAL BEHAVIOUR 101
relevant respects, even by the same workers with the same
subjects : for first fine raptures even careful raptures never
can be recaptured. So repeatability as it is known in physics
and chemistry may never be attainable in parapsychology
nor yet in all
ordinary psychology for that matter.
Again, the more we learn about these conditions, the more
hope there is
by exploiting our knowledge of the favouring
ones of getting stronger effects (better guessing averages).
Professor BroacTonce compared the present position of ESP
research to that of the study of electricity before the invention
of the Wimshurst machine : the strong effects (lightning ;
spontaneous cases) were sporadic and uncontrollable; while
the effects that could be got to order (by rubbing amber with
fur, etc.; by card-guessing experiments) were excessively
weak. This analogy excellently indicates what is wanted in
ESP work ; but it
suggests that our present position is
stronger
than it is. With ESP even our amber is unreliable. But, as
before, the fact that we want this provides no sort ofguarantee
that it is
possible to get it : there may be tight natural limits to
guessing capacity just as there are to athletic achievement,
even though we nave often been surprised, in both spheres, to
find that those limits are wider than we should have expected
(Shackleton: Zatopek).
Fifth, one day, perhaps, some subjects may learn that trick
of bringing their ESP capacity under conscious control.
(Guessing above, or below or at mean chance expectation at
will.) If this could be done the ideal of repeatability would
have been achieved. Thouless has suggested that here is a
place for experiments on oneself; always supposing oneself
happens to be endowed with any ESP capacity to control.
(Note : all this brings out sharply the inappropriateness of
talk about ESP capacities ; which is
why we have often pre-
ferred to substitute the gauche behaviour, which does not so
strongly suggest that conscious control has been attained.
Though behaviour commits us to the idea that the ESP cor-
relations are the responsibility of the subjects concerned:
a commitment of which we should be aware even if it is
apparently inescapable. Mr. Spencer Brown's enterprise
may or may not succeed: but it is
certainly not absurd;
or much more desperate than the other shifts to which one

Sixth there is no obvious reason why this should
have to go with conscious control some subjects might
learn to spot their successful guesses; which would make
classification of ESP as a species of knowledge a little less
inappropriate than it now is
(see Chapter IX). It is said that
spontaneous performers often put up a much better showing
in this respect than laboratory subjects. Though it is difficult
to be sure that this is
really so, and not a misleading appearance
produced by the natural preselection of putative spontaneous
cases before they come to the notice of researchers (see
Chapter III),
it
may be a genuine effect resulting from the
difference between the spontaneous situations, in which the
performer is often emotionally involved, and the highly
artificial experimental set-up, in which similar emotional
involvement is almost impossible to reproduce.
But all these six points add up to little more than a series of
apposite platitudes, and pious hopes. Yet perhaps precisely
this is
interesting : that though there are all sorts of things still
to be tried and too many reported results still
awaiting inde-
pendent confirmation (or not, as the case may be), at present
there do not seem to be any leads which are conspicuously
more promising and more exciting than all the others. For
instance :
though Rhine and his colleagues have tried with
some success the effects of some drugs there is
scope for a
systematic inquiry. Again, though some work has been done
with the electro-encephalograph to find what, ifany, electrical
disturbances there are in the brain during mediumistic and
laboratory ESP performances,
it is desirable to do more.
Next, since guessing Zener cards is a hit-or-miss affair, it is
obviously desirable to try other targets on which there could
be near-misses (magpies, inners, and outers, as it were : as well
as bulls and total misses). A technique for this has recently
been devised, using a pack of twelve cards showing clock dials
indicating different hours, with promising preliminary re-
sults. Then there is the problem of making the experimental
set-up more natural and more interesting. This is
important
not merely because so many potential subjects and experi-
menters find the prospect of guessing and supervising the

guessing of enormous series of tedious Zener cards repellent,
but because there are strong grounds for believing that bore-

colleagues have often introduced an element of gambling :
which generates interest and emotion. Tyrrell, as we have
mentioned, designed his machine especially to suit the bent
ofone star subject. Much the same applies to Dr. J. Hettinger,
whose books The Ultra-Perceptive Faculty and Exploring the
Ultra-Perceptive Faculty (Rider, 1940 and 1941) have attracted
some attention. Finding mediums who claimed to be able
paranormally to produce information about the owners of
objects submitted to them, he tried to work out methods for
testing this pretended capacity. Unfortunately, as Mr.
Christopher Scott has shewn in a shattering critique (Proc.
S.P.R., Vol. XLIX, pp. 16 ff.),
these techniques were riddled
with loopholes : the striking positive results reported must
be discounted completely ;
and the results offurther tests using
the Hettinger methods but with these loopholes blocked have
so far been negative consistently. Nevertheless Hettinger
was on the right lines in trying to adapt his tests to his per-
formers and in not trying to force them into a uniform, dull,
drill. Another thing :
apparently ESP effects are independent
of distance since there have been positive results on several
strictly run long-distance tests ;
a great deal more needs to be
done before we can say categorically that distance between
subject and target has no relation to score, at all.

confess to almost invincible incredulity : both about the
correlations reported, and to a far greater extent about
the interpretation put on them. Nevertheless the story
has to be told, for facts if facts they be will not change
just because we refuse to face them. The story begins in
March 1943, when the Journal of Parapsychology published a
paper by Rhine and his wife reporting an experimental study
ofwhat previously had been referred to as telekinesis (literally,

movement at a distance ") and
they

extraordinarily so to that followed in ESP investigations.

that the deviations may be due to bias either in the dice or in
the throwing of them, or even to paranormal precognition
(a species ofESP) ofthe way the dice were going to fall. Thus
the dice have sometimes been thrown mechanically :

as in the earlier case of ESP results were wholly negative :
Mr. Denys Parsons 1
who often has a damping effect on the
paranormal made 10,000 trials, obtaining only chance
results; Mr. Dennis Hyde also tried to repeat the Duke
achievements, but succeeded only in detecting a hitherto
unnoticed possible source of error. Dr. Thouless was the
first Englishman to report positive PK results : his first effort
introduced the innovation of using a coin instead of dice,
spinning it like a top, not tossing it ; but the deviations from
mean chance expectation were small compared with those at
Duke, and in any case Dr. D. J. West later showed that it is
much easier to fix the fall of spun coins by tilting them at the
start than might have been thought. Since then Thouless
has reported significant results with dice, but again nothing
like so striking as those from Duke : and Carington and J.
Fraser Nicol published some significant results obtained earlier
after a private hint from Rhine. But, considering the time
that has elapsed since the PK effects were first
reported, and
the fact thatjust like the ESP effects before them they were
reported in a confident tone which suggested that nearly
every experiment and nearly every subject had yielded
positive results, the amount of confirmation outside the
United States cannot be considered as
impressive
for a claim
so revolutionary. However, the effects have not been con-

This is what Rhine and others seem to have done. Taking
the word

to refer to some object, some sort of not-
brain, he assumes that minds and brains can significantly be
said to interact; and tries to interpret his results in terms of
this supposed interaction which, not surprisingly, is found to
be mysterious.

But this does not convict psychologists ofshirking the study of
the mind :
studying certain human capacities, feelings, and
performances is what is meant by studying the mind.

seen and heard : and so an explanation is looked for and found
in terms of some mechanical process. But with precognitive
ESP the analogy of perception breaks down even here.
For to use an Irishism the target thus extra-sensorily per-
ceived is not yet there to be perceived.
The solemn neologism ^recognition and its much less
fashionable brother retrocognition both imply that what is
involved is a species of knowledge. This is
precisely not the
case. For if ever a subject has or could have reasons to know
the value of the card which is the target of his guess, then that
guess is
ipso facto disqualified. The experiment is not then a
proper ESP test : and the
"
guess
"
is not a guess at all. The
subject whether consciously or unconsciously has cheated :
and the experimenter has been incompetent. To talk of
precognition, or even of cognition, in connection with ESP
is misleading also because it
suggests that the subjects know,
at the time of guessing and before the score is checked, which
guesses are the hits. But in dealing with the Soal and Goldney
work on Basil Shackleton we drew attention to the fact that
no relation of any kind could be discerned between the
correctness of guesses and the confidence the subject had in
them : while a similar fact was noted earlier as constituting
one of the main difficulties in the way of investigating a
possible
"
precognitive
"
factor in dreams.
Finally telepathy itself has drawbacks. It suggests to most
people the model of wireless telegraphy (cf. Upton Sinclair's
title Mental Radio) : which is
certainly not appropriate, for
the moment we try to fit it to the facts we have to start adding
complications and making excuses. For instance : all radia-
tive effects have an intensity proportionate to the distance
from source, whereas nothing like this has been observed with
ESP. Again: the "precognitive" ESP effect surely rules
out decisively all
possibility of explanation in terms of radia-
tion; mediumistic talk of "the vibrations," and so on is
simply empty mystification. The term telepathy has also
encouraged controversies as to whether success under particular
conditions was
"
really produced by telepathy
or by clair-
voyance
"
and whether
"
both telepathy ana clairvoyance
really occur." The questions both of fact and of meaning
involved have become inordinately tortuous and intricate

in terms of some mechanical process. But with precognitive
ESP the analogy of perception breaks down even here.
For-to use an Irishism-the target thus extra-sensorily per-
ceived is not yet there to be perceived.
The solemn neologism precognition-and its much less
fashionable brother retrocognition-both imply that what is
involved is a species of knowledge. This is precisely not the
case. For ifever a subject has or could have reasons to know
the value of the card which is the target of his guess, then that
guess is ipso facto disqualified. The experiment is not then a
proper ESP test: and the " guess " is not a guess at all. The
subject-whether consciously or unconsciously-has cheated:
and the experimenter has been incompetent. To talk of
precognition, or even of cognition, in connection with ESP
is misleading also because it suggests that the subjects know,
at the time ofguessing and before the score is checked, which
guesses are the hits. But in dealing with the Soal and Goldney
work on Basil Shackleton we drew attention to the fact that
no relation of any kind could be discerned between the
correctness of guesses and the confidence the subject had in
them : while a similar fact was noted earlier as constituting
one of the main difficulties in the way of investigating a
possible " precognitive " factor in dreams:
Finally telepathy itself has drawbacks. It suggests to most
people the model of wireless telegraphy (cf. Upton Sinclair's
title Mental Radio) : which is certainly not appropriate, for
the moment we try to fit it to the facts we have to start adding
complications and making excuses. For instance : all radia-
tive effects have an intensity proportionate to the distance
from source, whereas nothing like this has been observed with
ESP. Again: the "precognitive" ESP effect surell rules
out decisively all possibility of explanation in terms o radia-
tion; mediumistic talk of " the vibrations," and so on is
simply empty mystification. The term telepathy has also
encouraged controversies as to whether success under particular
conditions was " really produced by telepathy or by clair-
voyance " and whether " both telepathy and clairvoyance
reilly occur." The questions both of fact and of meaning
involved have become inordinately tortuous and intricate

since the establishment of precognitive effects : for it has
looked as if all cases of apparent clairvoyance (no agent) might
be alternatively described as cases of precognitive telepathy
directed towards the person who later checked the scores (an
unconscious agent) ; while all cases of
apparent telepathy
might likewise be alternatively described in terms of clair-
voyance, precognitive, or otherwise. Though these con-
troversies provide fascinating material for philosophers, their
value to the parapsychologists is more doubtful : for even if
different experimental meanings can be given to each of the
alternatives, there seems little reason to think that the question
involved is as important as the controversy has made it
seem, since most subjects seem to be able to score
equally
well (or badly)
whether there is or is not an agent (though
Soal's crack subjects provide an important exception).
If we insist on the analogies implied by any or these terms,
philosophical perplexities will arise at the points ofbreakdown.
Thus there is trouble if you apply the perception model.

.Again and again we correctly predict-we can even properly

of " free " is not ' predictable " but " compulsory.' The
Il6 DESCRIBING AND EXPLAINING
opposite of
"
predictable
"
is
"
unpredictable," not
"
free."
To act of one's own free will is not necessarily, or even often,
to act unpredictably ; but to act without constraint. We
can foresee many weddings which will not be shotgun
weddings : and many conceptions which will not be unpre-
meditated. Thus even if precognitive ESP were, which it is
not, a species of knowing, it would still not have the slightest
tendency to show that people never act of their own free
will. To think of it in this way is
asking for philosophical
trouble.
What we need, therefore, is a new terminology which does
not imply more than we want to imply, which is theoretic-
ally neutral, and which is not gratuitously provocative of
philosophical perplexity. In the present state of our ignor-
ance that means a terminology with the absolute minimum
of implications. To cover what had been called ESP (tele-
pathic or clairvoyant, precognitive or retrocognitive or what
have you) Thouless and Wiesner have suggested
"
i/j (read,
psi) phenomena." This suggestion is now generally followed
by students though sometimes they have spoken of
"
0-
processes
"
:
overlooking that part of the point of the innova-
tion was as Thouless said
'
the wish to outlaw the tradi-
tional controversies [telepathy versus clairvoyance, etc.] a#d to
replace them by the experimentally soluble problem of what
are the necessary or sufficient conditions of psi success
"
;
and gratuitously committing themselves to saying process is
involved. (When all we know is that correlations occur:
which is
certainly a different, and perhaps a crucially different,
matter.) After the publication of the first PK papers they
suggested that the meaning of their term should be extended
to include PK (which move committed them ofcourse to one
implication, that ESP and PK were associated ; but this was
intentional; and Rhine and his colleagues have accepted the
hypothesis involved). This extension also has been generally
accepted. But not yet their further suggestion that psi-
phenomena be .subdivided into 0y (read, psi-gamma: re-
placine
"
ESP ") and I/JK (read, psi-kappa :
replacing
"
PK ").
It might be as well to introduce a further series of letters for
distinguishing non-committally between
"
precognitive,"
"
retrocognitive," and simultaneous effects. Perhaps the
II6 DESCRIBING AND EXPLAINING
opposite of "predictable" is "unpredictable," not "free."

It may seem to many readers that we have laboured these
points. But there is the world of difference between, on the
one hand, securing a more or less unthinking assent to the

unsuitable explanatory models and provokes unnecessary
philosophical perplexity and, on the other hand, showing
why and how this is the case ;
so that the points bite deep into

we need to possess its antidote.
Second, because without it we shall be inclined to use even the
new terms without properly dissociating them from the old

will also suggest, what is the case, that any and every system
of classification must commit its users to some judgments as to
what distinctions can and should be made; but once it is
realized that this principle will apply, to some extent, even to
classification
by non-committal letters, we can guard against
the attendant dangers of unconscious prejudice here. Fourth,
because unless we really work ourselves free of the old and
familiar conceptions which we naturally try to impose upon
these psi-phenomena, inevitably we shall fail to realize their
radically peculiar characteristics; and thus make it more
difficult to form the new notions required for dealing with
them.
We can now begin to bring out some of these characteristics
and to say something about forming new notions. First,

may be an improper one. If so we must be

This brings us to the third point ;
for it suggests what is the
fundamental reason why scientists, and others sharing their
professional beliefs and attitudes, have been and, but to a
diminishing extent, still are inclined to dismiss out of hand
all evidence for the reality of psi-phenomena. Compare the
passionate protest of the great Helmholtz :

evidence of my own senses could lead me to believe in the
transmission of thoughts from one person to another, in-
dependently of the recognized channels of sensation
"
(quoted
by M. Polanyi in The Logic ofLiberty, Routledge, 1951). It is
certainly not that the evidence has been still less that it is
now so much weaker than the evidence for any of the other
things which we find no difficulty in believing : in religion, in
politics, or even in science. Nor yet that scientists are stub-
bornly unwilling to give up some particular theory. Some-
thing much more important is involved than any particular
theory, however fundamental, or
any single factual general-
ization, however well established : but it is
something ex-
tremely difficult to state clearly and satisfactorily. A psycho-
logist, Mrs. Knight, writing in Science News (No. 18, Penguin
Books, 1950, p. 9), confessed :
The facts revealed are so odd, so apparently chaotic, in a sense
so trivial and yet so difficult to organize within the accepted

Crudely, it can be put lille this: The occurrence of psi-

phenomena is
apparently incompatible with certain of the
fundamental beliefs and disbeliefs shared by scientists and not
only by scientists both about the sorts ofthings which do and
do not happen, and about the two matters are obviously not
independent the kinds of explanation which can be found
to cover them. Consider first what might be an analogous
though much more alarming case :
suppose that evidence
were to be found suggesting that one or several of the animal
species at present rated as
"
higher
"
(including perhaps homo
sapiens) had not in fact evolved from any
"
lower
"
species;
but had simply appeared in the geological record millions of
years too soon. If this evidence just could not be explained
away, if human skeletons kept on turning up in coal-seams or
other still earlier strata in which they had no business to be ;
and if the same sort of thing happened with the fossils of one
or two other
"
higher
"
species, then the framework of
biological science would collapse.
1
While beyond even the
wide boundaries of biology these discoveries would throw
doubt on the general presumption of continuous develop-
ment (continuity of development is not of course necessarily
progress) which is so vital a part of all scientific pictures of the
universe. For those of us for whom science has driven the
gorgons and the harpies out of the world, and revealed or
imposed a new order uncapricious, impersonal, and majestic
upon the chaos ofexperience : the suggestion is a nightmare.
Then, to bring out something of the difference between a
scientific sort of explanation and one non-scientific sort,
consider such a people as the Azande (cf. Witchcraft, Oracles,
and Magic among the Azande, by E. E. Evans-Pritchard,
O.U.P., 1937) whose world is
permeated by witchcraft, the
workings of which are revealed only and entirely by the
operations of benge an oracle poison. Their ideas of what

phenomena is apparently incompatible with certain of the
fundamental beliefs and disbeliefs shared by scientists-and not
only by scientists-both about the sorts ofthings which do and
do not happen, and about-the two matters are obviously not
independent-the kinds of explanation which can be found
to cover them. Consider first what might be an analogous
-though much more alarming-case : suppose that evidence
were to be found suggesting that one or several ofthe animal
species at present rated as " higher " (including perhaps homo
sapiens) had not in fact evolved from any "lower " species;
but had simply apreared in the geological record millwns of
years too soon. If this evidence just could not be explained
away, if human skeletons kept on turning up in coal-seams or
other still earlier strata in which they had no business to be ;
and if the same sort of thing happened with the fossils of one
or two other " higher " species, then the framework of
biological science would collapse.1 While beyond even the
wide boundaries of biology these discoveries would throw
doubt on the general presumption of continuous develop-
ment (continuity of development is not of course necessarily
progress) which is so vital a part of all scientific pictures of the
universe. For those of us for whom science lias driven the
gorgons and the harpies out of the world, and revealed or
imposed a new order-uncapricious, impersonal, and majestic
-upon the chaos ofexperience : the suggestion is a nightmare.
Then, to bring out something of the difference between a
scientific sort of explanation and one non-scientific sort,
consider such a people as the Azande (cf. Witchcraft, Oracles,
and Magic among the Azande, by E. E. Evans-Pritchard,
O.U.P., 1937) whose world is permeated by witchcraft, the
workings of which are revealed only and entirely by the
operations of benge an oracle poison. Their ideas of what
questions it is possible and proper to ask, of what requires
explanation, ana of what counts as an adequate explanation,

Second: psi-gamma (t/Jy) seems to involve "action-at-a-

of action-at-a-distance and have insisted on explanations
involving spatia-temporal continuity : one thing can affect
another only ifthere is a continuous chain of (physical) events
between the two ; if there ever seems to be a gap-between
the fire and the warmed h;uu:l, between the lamp and the
lighted page-they postulate and search for the connecting
links. Thus gravitational attraction offered perennial scandal,
until this was satisfactorily hushed up by talk ofgravitational
fields-" an incidental conception which is" as Einstein himself
confessed, " indeed a somewhat arbitrary one." St/Jy (" simul-

ofaction at a distance : because-as we showed earlier in this
chapter-experimental fmdings seem to have ruled out any-
thing we could call waves or rays, means or mechanism, in-
volved in a transmission of information between agent and

action-at-a-distance ; and that bodi backwards and forwards

tion ") the subject gets his significant scores when guessing
after (or before) the target series ceases to be (or becomes)
available. This clashes with another scientific (and common-
sense) belief: that where (as in reciting a piece of verbiage
learnt by heart) some remotely past event (in this case tne
learning of our rigmarole) is a precondition of a present per-
formance (inasmuch as we could not recite what we had
never learnt), nevertheless there must also be connecting
links between the past (partial)
cause and its
present effects.
We seek changes in the brain caused
by the original learning
process ;
lasting changes which ensure that afterwards suitably
stimulated, we recite our piece. But, for all the looking, up
to the present no such changes (called prematurely
"

traces
'
or

Bertrand Russell to suggest his notion ofmnemic causation,
"
in
which the proximate cause consists not merely of a present
event, but of this together with a past event
"
(Analysis of
Mind, Allen and Unwin, 1921, p. 85 : the index under this
head is
seriously deficient, for all the important references to
this Ch. IV are omitted). It was only a suggestion : made
possible because there was, and still is,
"
so far as I am aware,
no good evidence that every difference between the know-
ledge possessed by A and that possessed by B is
paralleled by
some difference in their brains" (p. 91); but not actually
adopted by Russell, because he thought it best
"
as a working
hypothesis" to maintain the belief "based upon analogies,
and general scientific maxims
"
that the evidence postulated
will in due course be found (pp. 92 and 91).
Fourth : most scandalous of all, P0y seems to conflict with
our scientific (and common-sense) assurance that what will
happen later cannot affect what happens now :
except perhaps
in a very Pickwickian sense, as one might say that people with
courage, foresight, and goodwill were influenced by the Second
German War even before it
began ; while knowing very well
that what really affected them was their then present know-
ledge that Germany would soon launch that war.
The notion ofcause is involved in all four cases, to a greater or
lesser extent : least perhaps in the determination of the first ;
more in the action at a distance of the second and third ; most
in the affecting and influencing of the fourth. And, as we

shall proceed to argue, it makes for a perhaps dangerously
misleading misdescription. But a word first about the scien-

occur. So it would be undignified and ultimately futile
for us to imitate the ostrich confronted by the giraffe : which
protested into the sand,

" "
It is clear," said
Aristotle,
"
that things which have happened are possible : for
if they were impossible, they would not have happened." If
previously we Believed psi-gamma was impossible : we shall
just have to revise our ideas about what sort of place the
universe is.
The key word here should be

and no excuse to react by abandoning wholesale positions
already won by science and all our scientific principles. We
must concede what occurs : but not that as in Hellzapoppin

the anomalous set of very weak effects constituted by these
excessively rare and elusive correlations, everytiling else is iust

exceptions to the various general principles against which
they offend until and unless either they become very much
more common, or parallel phenomena are found in other
fields there seems no reason why most sciences (scientists)
should be upset further. Ofcourse 0y is an untidy anomaly.
Of course one hopes that it will in time be fitted into some
scheme of scientific theory and prediction. But even suppose
it cannot be, that i/jy remains an anomaly, this will mean only
that in this
respect, too, the universe is not quite as we might
have wished. Perhaps we tend to be spoilt by our constant
success in formulating natural laws : to think that it is some-

Of course, if there were no such regularities anywhere, human
beings presumably could not have evolved and survived. But there
could have been far more irregularity than there is, or the regularities
could have been far harder to detect than they are, without preventing
human life.
Again, if in the infancy of natural science men had not
believed that there were findable regularities everywhere, perhaps
scientists would never have been able to muster the persistent confidence
to look for and find the regularities which can be found. But now
we can afford to consider the possibilities we have been mentioning,
without undermining and betraying the whole scientific quest.

It is
upsetting also in apparently forcing us to admit two new
species of action-at-a-distance ; one spatial (to go alongside
gravity); and one temporal (to which mnemic phenomena
alone possibly offer a parallel). Again we must not panic : we
must not abandon the so-called Postulate of Spatio-Temporal
Continuity, properly construed. For this should be taken as an
(invaluable) heuristic maxim, remaining
sound in spite of our
occasional failures (as here) to find what it bids us seek ; not
as a (mistaken) fundamental presupposition, now disproved by
the

of (these) exceptions, and due to bring down
in collapse trie whole structure of natural science supposedly

by a generous but reckless and undeliberate stretch of their

affecting, and so on, can be applied to such at present anyway
non-repeatable and essentially statistical phenomena as the

'in order to explain precognitions it seems necessary to
suppose that they are due to ... causal influence

this as a matter of conceptual innovation and not, directly,
of empirical discovery we should not during the same

Russell's suggestion of mnemic causation (see p. 123) shows

causation, in which what we should call the proximate cause
would be

around another different and preceding event, which may
then be counted as their common cause : the dropping of the
stone is counted as the common cause of all the surrounding

With our present conception of cause, using the word
"

as we do now, the criterion applies only to spatial
or spatio-temporal clustering: the effects have to occur
around the cause or around and soon after it. But Carington
found that hits on the target drawing were made irrespective
of the distance at which his subjects made their drawings :
but that hits on, say, Wednesday's target clustered round
Wednesday in time, before and after ; scores on Tuesday and
Thursday being equally good, and both much better than
those made on Monday and Friday, which were also about as
good as one another (see Chapter VIII). This is an example of
a purely temporal clustering. Mundle suggested that we might
decide to accept such temporal clustering as a new criterion
both of causal connection and of the direction of causal
influence ; the event which was central in time (in the Caring-
ton example, the display of the target drawing) being counted
as the cause of the temporally surrounding effects. To accept
this would be to revise our conception of* cause

first,
that we can and should adapt or add to our conceptual equip-

This is
only offered as a convenient stopgap way of thinking
of the phenomena, which is not so grossly unsatisfactory as

of heuristic fertility, though it does perhaps suggest a few
possibly useful questions. Similarly and again only till the
progress of research suggests a better, heuristically fertile or
genuinely explanatory, model cases of spontaneous psi-
gamma might be thought of as being or involving hunches.
At this point, after these meta-theoretical preliminaries,
it would be gratifying if we could either report that some
current theory was beginning to look plausible, or offer a
new candidate ofour own. Unfortunately we cannot. Two
suggestions have gained attention recently: the first was
Carington's theory of telepathy ;
the second the Shin theory
put forward by Thouless and Wiesner.
The gist of the former is that minds are systems of ideas and
experiences, which he calls psychons : that psychon-systems
are not wholly insulated from one another : and that the facts
of telepathy may be explained by assuming that there is
interaction ofpsychons in different
systems by the same laws of
association ofideas as used to be used by Associationist psycho-
logists in the attempt to explain the relations of ideas in any
one person. Thus Carington thought that it had been vital to
the success of his experiments with drawings that all subjects
had been supplied with an associative link, called a K olject,
in the shape of a photograph of his study, in which he was to
display tne target drawings. For thus each subject would
have in his psychon-system a picture idea which the agent
theory construction, have no place for it ; and that, when so precisified
as to be unusable, it is absuro), this notion of

(Carington) had in his. In Carington's psychon-system this
idea was associated with that of the target picture. So, on his
theory, the subjects would tend to associate their idea of his
study with that of the target picture. This theory, briskly
explained and developed by Carington in his book Telepathy
(Methuen, 1945), did seem to get away to a good start by
covering several of the main features of the phenomena : but
it does not pretend to cover the occurrence of psi-gamma
under "clairvoyance
"
conditions, still less that or psi-kappa
under any conditions.
The Snin theory postulates that "in normal thinking and
perceiving I am in the same sort of relation to what is
going
on in the sensory part of my brain and nervous system as that
of the successful clairvoyant to some external event
"
(viz.
psi-gamma), and likewise that
"
I control the activity of my
nervous system ... by the same means as that by which the
successful psycho-kinetic subject controls the fall of the dice or
other object (i.e. by psi-kappa)." Since "I" is
clearly not
being used here in the ordinary sense (for my brain and my
nervous system are parts of me, and not things with which I
can be in relations), but to refer to postulated entities, Thouless
and Wiesner borrowed the Hebrew letter & (Shin) to refer
to these entities, pointing out that they drew on a new alpha-
bet because they now wanted to refer to entities and not
processes ;
and they again used a letter, rather than a word
like
"
soul," because they did not want their term to have any
associations that were not justified by experiment (" The Psi
Processes in Normal and

This theory was elaborated to cover all forms of
psi-gamma,
and psi-kappa as well (to say nothing ofseance materializations,
attributed to psi-epsilon).
We cannot afford space for more than a few comments.
First, this Shin theory is obviously, albeit
tortuously,
related to
the

terminology criticized earlier. The essential
difference is that the former makes as clear as may be, both
that we are being offered a theory and what that

involves : while the latter, though it

both theories represent a reaction towards older ideas:
Associationism has long since died in psychology; while
Shin is the
"
Ghost in the Machine
" x
redivivus. Neither
theory is necessarily the worse for that, but either is
thereby
bound to meet from contemporary psychological and
philosophical orthodoxy with a resistance to the end.
Third, while Carington's theory, after a good start, meets
with a lot to explain away even in the restricted part of the
field which it tries to cover (e.g. a number of similar experi-
ments, with K-objects duly provided, have been quite nega-
tive],
the Shin theory, which has the merit of attempting a
unified account of all normal and paranormal psychology,
does not until and unless these postulated entities are supplied
with some putative characteristics seem to entail any experi-
mentally testable consequences at all (though it might suggest
that psychological conditions such as attention and effort in-
volved in perception and normal
"
volitional behaviour"
may tend to inhibit psi performances : and at least as far
as psi-gamma is concerned there is
good reason for saying
that this is
so). Carington's theory is testable, even though
the verdict seems to be going against it, because it commits
him to saying that the various sub-laws of association (those
of Recency, Repetition, etc.) will apply to telepathic associa-
tion also. The Shin theory, in its
present form, is not test-
able, precisely because it is so excessively non-committal.
It is excellent to use a vocabulary of letters, defined strictly in
terms of experimental observations, when the need is for
caution and for freedom from positively incorrect or possibly
misleading implications and suggestions. But in theory
construction something quite different is wanted. A theory
must go beyond the observations (preferably without con-
tradicting any ofthem) and imply (further and fairly definite)
experimentally testable consequences if it is to do its
job as
a scientific theory.
The Association and die Shin theories are both commend-
ably unorthodox as
any theory which is to explain psi will
have to be and they deserve more attention than we can
afford to give them. But a strong case can be made for saying
that the research situation is not yet ripe for theory construc-

contexts. The evidence at so many points is still
deplorably
conflicting. Unexpected effects have been discovered inde-
pendently by different workers, but the ideal of repeatability
has still to be achieved. Even with the best subjects on the
top of their form, the psi effects are very weak. Also,
another point importantly though differently related to
these, the concept of psi is
essentially statistical. Taken
together these three facts mean that the testing of hypotheses,
whether by reference to already recorded results or in new
experiments, tends at present to yield imprecise or conflicting
answers : while, if indeed the only laws we shall be able to
formulate here are going to be statistical, it
may be that the
quantity of work needed to begin to establish them will be
far greater than elsewhere. So until the present situation is
radically changed either by important discoveries about the
favouring and inhibiting conditions of psi, or by finding a
way to distinguish between paranormal successes and chance
hits singly, or by the sheer accumulation of experimental
data the theoretical prospect seems likely to remain poor.

Since this book was set up in print Mr. Spencer Brown has
generously allowed me to see two still
unpublished papers
relating to his work, mentioned several times above. Until
these and the rest of the articles he plans to write have been
published and thoroughly discussed, it will be too early to
say whether or not he has succeeded in carrying through the
Copernican revolution in the interpretation of the iff
cor-
relations ; and what repercussions this will have outside para-
psychology. But I should like to say here and now that the
prospects seem brighter to me than I had ever dared to expect.
If these prospects are realized I can only hope that some of
my arguments and points especially those in Chapters
VIII and IX will serve to prepare the way for the
acceptance
of his ideas, which involve the reinterpretation of au these
statistical correlations (y as well as /c).
The substance of
Chapters I-VII and the two appendices should survive this
possible revolution intact :

THE OUTLOOK FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH
This subject has no practical value, that is to say, it cannot be used
to accentuate the present inequalities of wealth or to promote directly
the destruction of human life.
G. H. HARDY, A Mathematician's Apology
THERE is
very little to be added in this chapter to what has
already been said explicitly under particular headings or
implicitly by the layout of the book as a whole. We have
tried to show that and why psychical research has progressed
from an
"
anecdotal
"
phase to an "observational" phase,
and from that on to the present experimental one. But the
fact that this development has been progressive, and that the
future lies primarily with the experimentalists, must not be
mistaken to mean that good
*
anecdotal
"
work on the
spontaneous phenomena, and good
"
observational
"
work
on mediums have not had, and will not continue to have, value

the destruction oj human life.

THERE is very little to be added in tlus chapter to what has
already been said explicitly under particular headings or
implicitly by the layout of the book as a whole. We have
tried to show that and why psychical research has progressed
from an " anecdotal " phase to an " observational " phase,
and from that on to the present experimental one. But the
fact that tlus development has been progressive, and that the
future lies primarily with the experimentalists, must not be
mistaken to mean that good ' anecdotal " work on the
spontaneous phenomena, and good " observational " work
on mediums have not had, and will not continue to have, value
and importance. It was work of the first two sorts which
suggested that the experiments would be worth starting : and
it is from the same source that we can hope to get ideas for
further experiments. The laboratory biologist does well to

too soon :
psychical research has in the past benefited enor-

found among its enthusiasts. Though full-time professional
workers are certain in the future to be the backbone of the
research effort, they will continue to need the help of enthusi-
astic amateurs to provide special knowledge, to assist in group
experiments, to watch for spontaneous phenomena, and to
search for gifted subjects. At present the problem is not to
find scope for amateurs but to provide posts for full-time
professionals. There are very few professional researchers

psychologists fortunate enough to be able to pursue para-

The trouble is that the major sponsors of scientific

that the findings of psychical

not prevent their having a contingent psychological connection,
in so far as people mistakenly 'see connections which are not
there. Facts which are logically irrelevant to a discussion
may well be very important, even decisive, in it : because we
do not always think as well as we should. Consider how
essential it is for historians (and political participants, profes-
sional or otherwise) to know, when dealing with some
situation, not only what it
actually was (is)
and how it would
have been (be) reasonable to estimate and react to it, but also
what the protagonists, perhaps mistakenly, thought (think)
it to be and how they did (do) estimate and react to it.
(Innumerable wrong judgments in history, politics, war, and

thought to be relevant can thereby actually become relevant :
because anyone treating the subject has to show that and why
this has been mistakenly believed.
First: about religion and theology. The present writer
has always understood that both of these were concerned,

religion and Christian theology with a God who was incarnate

psychical research should either support or undermine Christian
faith.

elements ; and parapsychology has of course done nothing
whatever to disprove this, in spite of occasional suggestions to
the contrary. But it would be ridiculous to draw from this
the conclusion that men arc merely chemicals, in any disturbing
sense. Certainly they are, in the undisturbing sense that that

140 THE OUTLOOK FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH
and IX we have made some remarks on this theme and thrown
suspicion on the dichotomy itself, nothing has been said
explicitly about any of the famous theories of their relations :
animism,

that there is a spiritual thing utterly different in
nature from the body, which interacts with the body, being
affected by it and likewise affecting it
"
;
psycho-neural
parallelism,
that two streams, of mental and neural events, run
parallel to one another, but in complete independence, like
two clocks back to back, keeping time ;
epiphenomenalism, that
mental events are a by-product ofneural events, not reducible
to these but yet un%ble to influence them, like phosphorescence
on a stream of water.
C. K. Ogden in his ABC of Psychology (Pelican Books,
1940, p. 21 ) remarks,
"
Perhaps the most interesting point in
the controversy is the extreme difficulty of finding any facts
which might decide between them when apparent differences
due to the prejudices which they invite have been eliminated."
There is room for a big book on the logical status of these
rival views; but just four points here. First, it is surely
doubtful whether they ought to be called, as Ogden calls
them,
"
rival hypotheses
"
(p. 21), unless the issues between
them could in principle be settled by experiment. Second,
granted that it is
possible to give an account of iffy without
postulating disembodied spirits, it is
surely wrong to think, as
is common, that epiphenomenalism is
definitely ruled out by
ifj.
There is no more difficulty in maintaining that iffy is a
property of the human nervous system (or some part of it)
than there is in attributing consciousness to the same system.
It is the merest superstition to insist that this is inconceivable ;
that matter, however organized, could not feel : and if it is
right to speak of iff
correlations as capacities, then there can be
no a priori objection to the idea that these are functions of the
central nervous system. (Compare the superstition still
stubbornly held by many who should have learnt better from
Hume's Dialogues concerning Natural Religion that the more
elaborate could not have evolved from the less elaborate, the
conscious from the inert, and so on ; and hence that we must
postulate a superior force working behind or before all the
apparent occurrences of this
supposedly impossible thing.)

there is ahead of us the adventure of finding out."

APPENDIX I
THE EVIDENCE OF AN ADVENTURE
A state of scepticism and suspense may amuse a few inquisitive
minds. But the practice ofsuperstition is so congenial to the multi-
tude that, if they are forcibly awakened, they still regret the loss of
their pleasing vision. EDWARD GIBBON, Decline and Fall.
IN August 1901 two English ladies paid to Versailles a visit
which has since become famous. These ladies were both
intelligent and respected, and both held high academic
positions :
one, Miss Moberly, having been Principal of St.
Hugh's College, Oxford ; and the other, Miss Jourdain, later
succeeded to the same post. In 1911 they published, under
two pseudonyms, their account of a joint visit, together with
Miss Jourdain's account of a later one she made by herself in
1902. This book, called simply An Adventure, presented their
conclusion, to which they had come after prolonged historical
researches, that the buildings, things, and people which they
had seen together in August 1901 and those which Miss
Jourdain had seen in January 1902 were, as it were, parts of an
eighteenth- rather than of a twentieth-century scene. If this
conclusion is sound, the authors must have enjoyed much the
most remarkable case of paranormal retrocognition (M0y)
ever recorded.
As almost everyone seems at some time either to have read
or to have read about this book, we need merely to run over
the highlights of the story to refresh memories before starting
to examine its foundations. In the late afternoon of a day
spent sight-seeing in and around the palaces of Versailles the
two ladies began to feel as if they had lost their way, and as if
something were wrong.

An extraordinary depression had

THE EVIDENCE OF AN ADVENTURE
A state of scepticism and suspense may amuse a few inquisitive
minds. But the practice ofsuperstition is so congenial to the multi-
tude that, if they arc forcibly awakened, they still regret the loss of
their pleasing l!ision.-EDWARD GIBBON, Decline and Fall.
IN August 1901 two English ladies paid to Versailles a visit
which has since become famous. These ladies were both
intelligent and respected, and both held high academic
positions : one, Miss Moberly, having been Principal of St.
Hugh's College, Oxford; and the other, Miss Jourdain, later
succeeded to the same post. In I9Il they published, under
two pseudonyms, their account of a joint visit, together with
Miss Jourdain's account of a later one she made by herself in
1902. This book, called simply An Adventure, presented their
conclusion, to which they had come after prolonged historical
researches, that the buildings, things, and people which they
had seen together in August 1901 and those which Miss
Jourdain had seen inJanuary 1902 were, as it were, parts of an
eighteenth- rather than of a twentieth-century scene. If this
conclusion is sound, the authors must have enjoyed much the
most remarkable case of paranormal retrocognition (Mify)
ever recorded.
As almost everyone seems at some time either to have read
or to have read about this book, we need merely to run over
the highlights of the story to refresh memories before starting
to examine its foundations. In the late afternoon of a day
spent sight-seeing in and around the palaces of Versailles the
two ladies began to feel as if they had lost their way, and as if
something were wrong. " An extraordinary depression had
come over " one of them. At the time she apparently attri-
buted this to natural tourist-tiredness; but afterwards she
thought that it had been the result, and not the cause of her
"uncomfortable sensations," and remembered herself as not
at all tired. The other described her feelings as eerie, cul-
I42

minating in the impression ofsomething uncanny,
"
a dreamy
unnatural oppression." But she carefully explains that she
"
did not mean that she had the least idea at the time that any
of the people encountered were unreal or ghostly
"
and that
"
this was still more true of the scenery."
They were at the entrance of a garden, and went in. Here
they saw two men whom one described as dressed in
* *
greyish
green coats with small three-cornered hats
"
and the other as
"
in official dress greenish in colour."
"
We spoke of them
as gardeners because we remembered a wheelbarrow of some
kind and the look of a pointed spade." Later they came to
believe that these were the two brothers Bersy, attendants on
Marie Antoinette, who, their later research showed, were
likely to have been on guard somewhere thereabouts in 1789.
Next they saw a bridge and a kiosk which they said could
not be identified with the bridge and kiosk which were standing
in 1901 : but could be with their predecessors of 1789. Near
the kiosk sat a man in a slouch hat and cloak. They did not
like the look of him at the time. Later they thought he
might have been the Comte de Vaudreuil, well known at the
Court of Marie Antoinette. After this a running man with a
"
curious smile
"
caught them up. At the time they thought
he was one ofthe gardeners, ofwhom they had asked the way,
coming to put them right. Afterwards they thought that he
was a messenger coming to tell Marie Antoinette of the
approach of the mob : but had nothing to say of the in such
circumstances very curious smile. It was only afterwards
that they
"
realized for the first time the theatrical appearance
ofthe man . . . the inappropriateness ofthe wrapped cloak on a
warm summer afternoon, the unaccountableness ofhis coming
and going."
Near tne Petit Trianon one of them saw a lady, unnoticed
by the other, wearing a pale green fichu and sitting on a
seat on the grass. She took her for a tourist at the time, but
afterwards identified her as a vision of Marie Antoinette,
whom their research showed to have possessed green bodices
and white fichus in 1789.
Finally the incident of the
"
chapel door." A young man,
who looked
"
inquisitively amused," appeared, and snowed
them the way. They thought he came from a door which

who looked "inquisitively amused," appeared, and showed
them the way. They thought he came from a door which
144 THE EVIDENCE OP AN ADVENTURE
they later identified as that of a disused chapel. But there
had not in 1901 for years been any door that could be opened
in this place; though they became convinced that the one
in question had been in use in 1789. They thought they had
heard this blocked-up door bang as the young man came
through it.
Returning three years later to Versailles Miss Moberly
remarked:
"
Not only was there no trace of the old paths
[which they thought they had traversed in 1901 A. F.] but
the distances were contracted, and all was on a smaller scale
than I recollected."
The
"
explanation
"
the ladies themselves offered for all
this was that they
"
had entered within an act of the Queen's
memory when alive."
"
What more likely, we thought,
than that during those hours in the Hall of Assembly [Paris,
Aug. 10, 1792 A. F.] . . . she had gone back in such vivid
memory to other Augusts spent at Trianon, that some impress
ofit was imparted to the place." They wondered
"
whether
this explained their curious sensation of being shut-in and
completely oppressed."
Ot course, this is not really an explanation at all, but only
a specious piece of vaguely suggestive talk which could be
dismissed as altogether meaningless but for its suggestions
that the two ladies were in a retrocognitive psi relation with,
that there was some significant correlation between, their
experiences and those ofMarie Antoinette on August 10, 1792.

the face of outlandish seeming facts to offer empty paradoxical
phrases as explanations. (We shall be examining a more

possible is

"
: not everyone would be so
charitable. We shall confine ourselves nere to a few of the
major points of weakness in the evidence: anyone who
wishes to pursue the business further should refer to the books
and papers mentioned at the end of this Appendix.
First, the earliest records of the alleged experiences that we
have were made a considerable time after the event. The
first visit to Versailles was on August 10. Miss Moberly
completed and signed her account on November 25 (107 days
after), while Miss Jourdain finished hers only on November 28
(no days after), adding a note that she had written before
seeing her companion's version. In the book there is a
reference to a
"
descriptive letter
"
(First edition, p. n) writ-
ten by Miss Moberly in the first week after the incident : but
this, apparently the only memorandum made by either lady
for over three months, is not available.
Second, there is
positive reason to believe what the sceptical
would in any case suspect both that a certain amount of
mutual suggestion went on between the protagonists before
they began to write, and that speculation and imagination
were at work to distort their memories in that long interval.
The authors say (p. n) that they confided to each other their
belief that the Petit Trianon was haunted in the first week after
August 10. Miss Jourdain in a letter to Miss Moberly dated
November 12 mentions that a French lady had told her of a
tradition that Marie Antoinette and other members of her
Court haunted Versailles.
Third and this also has considerable bearing on the two
former points the two documents mentioned above only
appear in the second, and not in subsequent editions of the
book : the case has usually rested on two still later documents,
given in all editions of the book : and the differences between
these and the two earlier versions are most significant. The
purpose of the two later documents was said to have been to
give
a fuller account
"
for those who had not seen the place
"
:
but the authors went far beyond this. For in one or other, or
both, of these later documents there are substantial differences
in the accounts given ofall the people met with : and all these

as established facts at all. Indeed the most charitable ;verdict
possible is "Not Proven": not everyone would be so

ten by Miss Moberly in the first week after the incident : but
this, apparently the only memorandum made by either lady
for over three months, is not available.
Second, there is positive reason to believe-what the sceptical
would in any case suspect-both that a certain amount of
mutual suggestion went on between the protagonists before
they began to write, and that speculation and imagination
were at work to distort their memories in that long interval.
The authors say (p. 11) that they confided to each other their
beliefthat the Petit Trianon was haunted in the first week after
August 10. Miss Jourdain-in a letter to Miss Moberly dated
November 12-mentions that a French lady had told her of a
tradition that Marie Antoinette and other members of her

into the Versailles of 1901 . For instance : MissJourdain in her
first version mentions a woman and a girl seen together, with-
out commenting on their dress; in her second version we
learn
"
I
particularly noticed their unusual dress/* Again :
Miss Moberly in her first account of the incident of the run-
ning man
"
could not follow the words he said
"
;
but by the
time she wrote her second version she had remembered
fourteen words and something about the accent in which
they had been spoken. Finally, the young man or boy who
simply came out of the Petit Trianon in both earlier versions,
in both later accounts came out slamming the door; the
significance of this lies in the fact that in 1901 this door had
been kept closed for years, but had presumably been unlocked
and available for slamming in the eighteenth century.
Fourth, the originals of these two later documents are not
available, and their dates of composition are questionable. At
the time of the second edition of their book (1913) the authors
believed that they had written them in November and Decem-
ber 1901. But when they first got into touch with the S.P.R.
in 1902, they sent the two earlier accounts only : the Society,
in the person of Mrs. Sidgwick, was not greatly impressed.
In 191 1, after the publication ofthe book, the authors explained
to the then Research Officer of the S.P.R. that it was only in
1904, after making certain topographical discoveries in the
course of their continuing researches into the aspect of
eighteenth-century Versailles, that they attached any import-
ance to the later documents. By a curious non sequitur they
proceeded in 1906 to copy them into a notebook : and then
destroyed the originals. The whole inconsequential story
suggests that their memories about the composition of these
documents had become very confused. And as Mr. W. H.
Salter remarks, with restraint, in his excellent summary of the
evidence
Whether that is so or not, the destruction of original docu-
ments later to be published as the foundation ofan extraordinary,
supernormal experience reflects oddly on their standards of
evidence (S.P.R. Journal, Vol. XXXV, No. 656, p. 183).
In the light of all that has been said before about the
fallibility of memory and the possibilities of self-deception

In the light of all that has been said before about the
fallibility of memory and the possibilities of self-deception
THE EVIDENCE OF AN ADVENTURE 147
and mutual suggestion, it should be quite clear that the
evidence as to what the two ladies actually did experience on
August 10, 1901, is in the highest degree unreliable. But even
if this were not so, the case still has many other major weak-
nesses. No effort was made immediately after the incident to
find who had been normally present along the route :
then,
but not now, it
might have been possible to make detailed
though disappointing identifications; though cases taking
place in the open are notoriously hard to investigate. It is
hard to believe that even academic women had they actually
"
seen
"
people in eighteenth-century costume on a twentieth-
century walk would have failed to notice and comment to one
another on this fact at the time. The internal evidence indicates
that their sense of direction was poor :
yet a large part of the
case for paranormality rests on the claim that the topography
of their experience was that of 1789, and not that of 1901.
And so on. Mr. Salter sums up with restraint
The authors recorded, investigated, and published their
experience in such a way as to leave the whole affair in an im-
penetrable fog of uncertainty. All this would have been
avoided if they had added to their many virtues some know-
ledge of the standards of evidence, and the recognized procedure
for conforming to them, that the peculiar subject-matter of
psychical research makes necessary (foe. tit.
p. 186).

course, in the most famous case of Einstein and his col-
leagues so indeed it was. This is no place for a discussion of
the successive Relativity theories ;
nor is the present writer the
person to provide it. But they are indirectly relevant : for
Dunne had a greater than average knowledge of mathematics
and physics, and was therefore enormously impressed and
influenced by the Einsteinian revolution; while the vogue
which his books enjoyed may be partly accounted for by the
fact that he was writing for a public which has lately become
hazily aware of the recent reconstruction of physical thought.
This reconstruction had been made necessary by the discovery
of certain recalcitrant macroscopic phenomena which could
not be fitted into the older Newtonian framework, and it
consisted largely in finding a way to give a convenient physi-
cal application to a particular four-dimensional geometric
calculus : hence the popular physicists' talk of the universe as
"
a four-dimensional space-time continuum/' in which time
is taken as a fourth dimension; and hence by suggestion
Dunne's idea that a further set of extremely recalcitrant
phenomena those of P^/y (*' paranormal precognition ") in
dreams and elsewhere might be similarly explained if we
were
"
to introduce a new dimension
"
(third edition, Faber
1934, p. 4). (Though Dunne thought he was under
"
logical
compulsion
"
to introduce not merely one but extravagantly
an infinite series.)
Unfortunately suggestions about the need to introduce or
postulate new dimensions in order to explain are little more
than so much perplexed or pretentious talk unless certain
fundamentals are realized. The point is that if they are to be
of any use, or indeed even to have any definite meaning, they
must involve finding relevant applications for geometrical
calculi of more than four dimensions : and this must in-
volve both selecting one of the calculi of this sort which the

fact that he was writing for a public which has lately become
hazily aware of the recent reconstruction of physical thought.
This reconstruction had been made necessary by the discovery
of certain recalcitrant macroscopic phenomena which could
not be fitted into the older Newtonian framework, and it
consisted largely in finding a way to give a convenient physi-
cal application to a particular four-dimensional geometric
calculus : hence the ropular physicists' talk of the universe as
"a four-dimensiona space-time continuum," in which time
is taken as a fourth dimension ; and hence by suggestion
DUlme's idea that a further set of extremely recalcitrant
phenomena-those of Pifry (" paranormal precognition ") in
dreams and elsewhere-might be similarly explained if we
were " to introduce a new dimension" (third edition, Faber
1934, p. 4). (Though Dunne thought he was under "logical
compulsion" to introduce not merely one but-extravagantly
-an infinite series.)
Unfortunately suggestions about the need to introduce or
postulate new dimensions in order to explain 1/J are little more
than so much perplexed or pretentious talk unless certain
fundamentals are realized. The point is that if they are to be
of any use, or indeed even to have any defmite meaning, they
must involve finding relevant applications for geometrical
calculi of more than four dimensions : and this must in-
volve both selecting one of tl1e calculi of this sort which the

There is no need to be alarmed at the mere mention of
two-, three-, four-, five-, or any number you like dimensional
calculi :
though to have to follow or work them out would
be quite another thing. Very roughly speaking what is
involved is this: an n-dimensional calculus (where n is a
number) is a geometry, or a geometrical calculus, concerned
with the spatial,
or (perhaps better) logical, relations between
points determined by n co-ordinates, points which need n
co-ordinates to fix their position. Plane geometry, such as
we all learnt in school, is a two-dimensional calculus : because
the positions of points on a plane surface can be fixed by the
use of two axes and two co-ordinates : and all the theorems
can be worked out as theorems about the logical relations be-
tween points determined by two co-ordinates. Indeed, what
is meant by saying that the geometry of plane surfaces is two-
dimensional is
precisely this : that points in it can be fixed
by
two co-ordinates; that the word "point" in these calculi
can be defined in terms of two numbers. Likewise solid
geometry can be done as a three-dimensional calculus : for
the positions of points on or in a solid require three axes and
three co-ordinates for their fixing. Again, what is meant by
calling this geometry three-dimensional is
simply that points
in it can be fixed by three co-ordinates : the word
"
point
"
here can be defined in terms of three numbers. Furthermore,
just as ordinary plane and solid geometry can be done as a
logical calculus of the relations between points determined by
two and three co-ordinates, respectively, and without the
use of any physical or mental diagrams or models, so it is

(S.P.R.
Journal, Vol. XXXVI, No. 666) ; also comments by various critics
(Vol. XXXVI, No. 668). Smythies gets as far as suggesting a suitable
sort of calculus, but does not indicate how it is to be applied. I tried to
show in my comment there how his ideas were largely the result of a
misconstruction of the logic of perception words : as I shall here try
to show that Dunne's arose from a similar misconstruction of the
logic of time expressions. In both cases the empirical discoveries
caused a trauma which was an important element in the aetiology of
theories which in fact are philosophical rather than empirical.

this also called geometries, in which the points are determined
by any number of (by n) co-ordinates. Systems of this
sort are called ^-dimensional. All that
"
^-dimensional
"
means is that points are defined in terms ofn numbers. Other
basic terms like
"
parallel" may also be defined in different
ways, as is done when the so-called parallel postulate ofEuclid
is varied. The logical systems in which these terms occur may
be said to be the geometries of various exotic sorts of surface,
or even of space, regardless of the fact that it
may be im-
possible to provide for these calculi any illustrative figures or
models such as those which helped out our study of Euclidean
school geometry.
It is most important to realize the fact that key words such
as
"

"
point,"
"
space," and
"

are all
being used in senses importantly different from, though
analogous to, their everyday senses when they are used in or
ofany mathematical system, including even ordinary Euclidean
geometry (and furthermore that they are used in mutually
different but analogous senses in most or all of the various
calculi in which they appear). It is because of our failure to
appreciate this that we find the mathematicians' talk of points
with no size, lines with no width, ^-dimensional geometry,
and different sorts of space, so paralysingly paradoxical (and
it is because of this, too, that we are prepared to countenance
platonizing insinuations that marks on paper which certainly
are lines in the ordinary sense ofthe word are somehow really
only failed lines :
simply because in the mathematical sense
they are not lines at all).
As so often with the scientists, like-
wise here with the mathematicians, the paradoxical appearance
of what is said to be going on arises from our failure to realize
(and sometimes, too, from the failure of the specialists them-
selves to explain or perhaps to realize) that words of everyday
discourse are being used here in peculiar senses.

so long as we insist on trying to interpret what is said on the
mistaken assumption that the key words are being used in
their everyday senses, we shall remain baffled.

But even when the notion of an ^-dimensional calculus is
grasped, there may be difficulty in seeing how such calculi can
be applied to the world. Once again this is a matter which in
detail is
excessively difficult. But very roughly one can
say
that it is an essential part of scientific progress to select calculi
which can be conveniently applied to whatever range of
phenomena the scientist is concerned with ;
and to give them
this application : which is a matter of showing what in the
Ehenomena
can be treated as points, or lines, or whatnot ; and

of geometrical optics as taught in school physics consisted
in finding ways of applying the calculi of Euclidean geometry
and trigonometry to the explanation and prediction of the
relations between such apparently unmathematical things as
opaque obstacles, transparent media, illuminated surfaces,
shadows and so forth.

navigation we can treat as points all sorts of things towns,
river confluences, railway junctions, lighthouses none of
which are points in either the ordinary* or any of the mathe-
matical senses. This is the clue to how we can find applica-
tions for H-dimensional calculi, though we rightly feel mat it
would make no sense to suggest that there could be another
spatial dimension in exactly the sense in which height, width,
and length are called spatial dimensions. An n-dimensional
calculus which for the moment it would perhaps be better
to call an tt-co-ordinate calculus, to escape the confusion
inevitably generated by the various ambiguities and associa-

sets of numbers which could be treated as co-orainates.

wherever speech has made its way. . . .
His idea was that temporal happenings involved motion in a
fourth dimension. Ofcourse he did not call it a fourth dimension
his vocabulary hardly admitted of that but he was entirely
convinced :
(1) That Time had length, divisible into "past" and
"
future."
(2) That this length was not extended in any Space that
he knew of. It stretched neither north-and-south, nor east-
and-west, nor up-and-down, but in a direction different from
any of those three that is to say in a fourth direction.
(3) That neither the past nor the future was observable.
All observable phenomena lay in a field situated at a unique
"
instant
"
in the Time length an instant dividing the past
from the future which instant he called
"
the present."
(4) That this

"
field of observation moved in some
queer fashion along the Time length, so that events which were
atfirst in the future became present and then past. The past was
constantly growing (pp. 130 and 131).
Mr. Dunne next proceeds to point out that :
The employment of these references (i.e. the words ho has

consequence of having started with the hypothesis of a move-
ment through Time's length. For motion in Time must be
timeable. If the moving element is
everywhere along the
Time length at once, it is not moving. But the Time which
times that movement is another Time. And the

passage
"
of that Time must be timeable by a third Time. And so on ad

had a vague glimpse of this endless array of Times,
one, so to say, embracing the other, that our discoverer abandoned
further analysis (p. 312).
Three comments :
frst, that there is a large class of idioms
which do suggest this sort of thing ; second, that if this sugges-
tion is accepted then the infinite regress indicated by Dunne
does indeed develop ; and third, that it is
quite wrong to do
what Dunne does that is to say, to develop these suggestions
and then to attribute the resulting metaphysical construction
to the man-in-the-street thus casting a mantle of everyday
sobriety over the shoulders of a logical extravaganza.
Thefirst is
easy to support. Dunne himself mentions some
of these suggestive idioms
"
when tomorrow comes,"
"
when I
get to such and such an age,"
"
the years roll by,"
and
"
the stages oflife's
journey." We speak of" the Future
coming to meet us all," of
4 *
the march of Time," of
"
Time,
the ever rolling stream," and (particularly at election times)
of
"
marching forward looking steadfastly into the Future."
Such idioms do suggest that we live in
"
a universe in which
Time has length and in which events are observed in succes-
sion (p. 198). In fact, if we had to describe the class of
idioms to which we are referring, we could scarcely do so
better than by saying that we were speaking of those idioms
in which we talk ofthe events which occur in succession in the
same place or to the same person as if they were not different
and successive events, but different objects or different places
which were observed or visited one after another. In the
examples so far given the suggestion is made by a moribund
metaphor. We talk, for instance, of the
"
march of time," a
marcn which must of course be a march from event to event.
And this piece of picturesque language thus gives rise to the
idea that to borrow a phrase from Sir Arthur Eddington
"
Events do not happen : we merely come across them."
Second, Dunne has seen that if the suggestions made or
insinuated by these idioms are adopted, then a mysterious
infinite regress develops.
"
If Time passes or grows or
accumulates or expends itself or does anything whatever
except stand rigid and changeless before a Time-fixed observer,
there must be another Time which times that second Time,
Ij6 AN !XP!IUMENT WITH TIM! "
-A. F.J had a vague glimpse of this endless array of Times,
one, so to say, embracin~ the other, that our discoverer abandoned
further analysis (p. 312).
Three comments : first, that there is a large class of idioms
which do suggest this sort ofthing; second, that ifthis sugges-
tion is accepted then the infmite regress indicated by Dwme
does indeed develop; and third, that it is quite wrong to do
what Dwme does-that is to say, to develop these suggestions
and then to attribute the resulting metaphysical construction
to the man-in-the-street-thus casting a mantle of everyday
sobriety: over the shoulders ofa logical extravaganza.
Thefirst is easy to support. Dwme himselfmentions some
of these suggestive Idioms-" when tomorrow comes,"
"when I get to such and such an age," "the years roll by,"
and" the stages oflife's journey." We speak of" the Future
coming to meet us all," of " the march ofTime," of " Time,
the ever rolling stream," and (particularly at election times)
of" marching forward looking steadfastly into the Future."
Such idioms do suggest that we live in " a universe in which
Time has length and in which events are observed in succes-
sion" (p. 198). In fact, if we had to describe the class of
idioms to which we are referring, we could scarcely do so
better than by saying that we were speaking of those idioms
in which we talk ofthe events which occur in succession in the
same place or to the same person as if they were not different
and successive events, but ilifferent objects or different places
which were observed or visited one after another. fu the
examl'les so far given the suggestion is made by a moribund
metaphor. We talk, for instance, ofthe " march oftime," a
march which must ofcourse be a march from event to event.
And this piece of picturesque language thus gives rise to the
idea that-to borrow a phrase from Sir Arthur Eddington-
" Events do not happen: we merely come across them."
Second, Dunne lias seen that if the suggestions made or
insinuated by these idioms are adopted, then a mysterious
infinite regress develops. " If Time passes or grows or
accumulates or expends itself or does anything whatever
exceptstand rigid and changeless before aTime-fixed observer,
there must be another Time which times that second Time,
AN EXPERIMENT WITH TIME 157
and so on in an apparent series to infinity
"
(p. 158).
"
Events
do not happen: we merely come across them." Then
someone asles,
"
We come across them one after another, I
suppose?
"
And we notice that the event of coming across
event number one itselfmust occur before the event ofcoming
across event number two. And the event of coming across
the event of coming across event one must again itself occur
before the event of coming across the event of coming across
event two. And here we have that infinite regress which
generated Dunne's theory. "The glaring regress in the
notion oftime was a thing which had intrigued me since I was
a child of nine. (I
had asked my nurse about it)
"
(pp. 4-5).
Third, it is
quite wrong of Dunne to develop this infinite
regress from the suggestions of idiom and then to claim the
respectability of everyday familiarity for his metaphysical
construction, by attributing it to the man-in-the-street, whose
ideas,
"
canonized
"
and
"
enshrined in
popular language . . .
have stood the test of numerous centuries and have been
accorded unhesitating acceptance wherever speech has made
its
way" (p. 130). Mr. Dunne in effect admits that this
attribution was unwarranted : for he concedes that the plain
man's vocabulary did not permit him to talk of a
"
fourth
dimension
"
(p. 130) ; and also that after
"
a vague glimpse of
this endless array or Times [he] abandoned further analysis
"
(p.
1
32). The plain fact bemnd. this picturesque talk about the
man-in-the-street is that our language is saturated with sugges-
tions which could be developed into every sort ofparadox and
absurdity. They are not adopted by the adult layman (for
he has been conditioned not to press idioms to
absurdity)
but only by the child in his unschooled simplicity and
by
tnc
metaphysician in his trained subtlety. It is not a coincidence
that the Alice books, which contain a vast collection of such
paradoxes and absurdities, were written by a brilliant logician
For the delight of an intelligent child.
Much more might be said about Dunne's Scrialism : but
this should be enough to show both that it is radically unsound
and that it
provides an object lesson ofwhat is
likely to happen
if we let language get out of control.
