  		              		Experience Description   

    My experience is really short.  I was knocked out for a few seconds, so I do not remember if it happenend before or after the impact. I saw someone sitting in the passenger seat, but I was alone with only my dog. When another driver came to help, I came to.  The first words out of my mouth was , 'Where is my friend?'  The other driver said there was nobody there but me.  I was confused. I SAW someone there. I saw an image that was very light but it clearly was a woman 30-40 years old.  Her dark hair was pulled back.  She was looking straight ahead while sitting in the passenger seat. She was wearing a black sweater and biege shorts.  Although she wasn't looking right at me, I knew she was there. 

She might have resembled someone I knew who was alive, but not like it was someone I really knew. As far as I know , I don't think it was a deceased person from my family.  I don't know who it was, but she was there for a brief second. I thought I was just out of it, but she is still clear in my head. It gives me shivers to think about. I believe she saved me and my dog's life.
