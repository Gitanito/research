 The journal was prompted by the visit of Johann Spurzheim to the United States (he died in Boston in 1832 and the Boston Phrenological Society was begun the same day), and consisted almost exclusively of articles from abroad, primarily Edinburgh.  Bela Marsh (1797-1869) was a Boston publisher who went on to become one of the leading spiritualist publishers in the early days of the movement, publishing notably works of Allen Putnam, Andrew Jackson Davis, Warren Chase, P.B. Randolph, Adin Ballou, and others.  His bookshop on Cornhill Street, Boston, advertised itself as the depot for physiological, phrenological, water-cure, reform/anti-slavery, and spiritualist works.
