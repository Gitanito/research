  ABSTRACT:&nbsp;    One of the last frontiers of study surrounds   spirituality and NDE.&nbsp; However, this is a highly sensitive issue due to the   nature of religion.&nbsp; What this study attempts to do is to objectively look at   the data submitted by NDErs to the website and to categorize the answers.&nbsp;   Questions that are analyzed include pre and post NDE religious preference, and   changed beliefs.&nbsp; There are some surprising results that focus on universal   purpose and order gained from NDE understandings.

  INTRODUCTION

My first   research project involved Soulmates and near-death experience (NDE).&nbsp; (Long,   2002).&nbsp; Those who had a near-death experience are those people who have   died or had an imminent life-threatening event and subsequently come back to   life.&nbsp; During the time of &quot;death&quot; there   was an experience or a collection of memories.&nbsp; What was interesting about the research was that for an overwhelming   majority of NDErs, they used the words &quot;spiritual&quot; and &quot;love&quot; interchangeably.&nbsp;   The more love they felt, the more spiritual the experience.&nbsp; Many would refer to   spirituality and contrast it with religion.&nbsp; Religion was considered the   routine, social structure and practices of a group.&nbsp; However, spirituality   lacked the dogma associated with religion.&nbsp; Instead of words and habits, it is   the actual feeling of love and the conscious exercise of free will to bring one   closer to God.&nbsp;

Along the same lines,   M. Scott Peck, M.D., defines love as the will to extend one's self for the   purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth (Peck, 1998, p.   81).&nbsp; He outlines four stages of spiritual growth: 1) chaotic/antisocial;   2) formal/institutional; 3) skeptic/individual; and 4) mystical/communal (Peck,   1993, pp. 119-126). To that I would add stage 5 which would be the stage of   becoming.&nbsp;

About twenty percent   of the people fall into the first stage (Peck, 1993, p. 121).&nbsp; He terms these   people as chaotic because this stage includes unprincipled people in which   spirituality is absent.&nbsp; Moreover, the term of antisocial refers to people who   are self-serving, manipulative, great actors but incapable of forming loving   relationships.&nbsp;

The second category   is used to describe those who need structure in their lives (Peck, 1993, p.   122). &nbsp;In this category are the religious church-goers, scientists who maintain   the status quo, and people with a regimented mentality such as military or   authoritarian.&nbsp; One distinguishing feature of this group is they have a tendency   to externalize God and generally envision God as masculine.&nbsp; By externalization,   God is thought of as up and out there rather than within each of us.&nbsp; One of the   big keys to this group is ritual and the reluctance to change that ritual.&nbsp; Truth-seekers and   scientists are an integral part of the third category (Peck, 1993, p. 124).&nbsp; He   admits that stage four is a bit nebulous (Peck, p. 125). However, he describes   these people with a sense of universality and those who see the connection in   all life.&nbsp; I would add stage 5 based upon NDE observations (Long, 2002).&nbsp; These   are the people who don't just talk about love and spirituality, they actually   become spirit.&nbsp; These are the true saints that are able to take the love they   know from the other side and to make their earth reality &quot;as above, so below.&quot;&nbsp;   They are love incarnate on earth.

Out of a total of 280   NDErs, this study analyzes responses to questions about pre- and post-religious   preferences.&nbsp; One of the most challenging areas of NDE research surrounds   religion.&nbsp; If one recalls the relatively recent disagreement between Michael Sabom and Kenneth Ring then   this study may be controversial due   to the sensitive nature of religious issues (JNDS, 2000). Therefore, I   want to stress that this study does not endorse one religion over another.&nbsp; It   certainly does not try to prove or disprove a religious belief.&nbsp; And most certainly,   this study does not involve proselytizing.&nbsp; The following are only observations   drawn from   data submitted by NDErs.&nbsp; The reader can draw their own conclusions from the   data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

METHODOLOGY

This study is a   retrospective review of data received from an Internet survey on the Near Death   Experience Research Foundation (NDERF) website     www.nderf.org (Long, 2002). Out of a total of   626 experiences submitted to the website, 302 of these experiences met the   research definition of NDE as defined as, &quot;A lucid experience associated with   perceived consciousness apart from the body occurring at the time of actual or   threatened imminent death&quot;&nbsp; (Long).&nbsp; It was then determined which of the 302   NDEs answered the pre and post NDE questions about religious preference.&nbsp; The   one question asks for &quot;Your religious background at time of   experience (Faith/denomination (or 'None')&quot; and the other question asks for   &quot;Your religious background currently (Faith/denomination (or 'None').&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Both questions gave option button selection choices of   &quot;Conservative/fundamentalist,&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Moderate,&quot; and &quot;Liberal.&quot;&nbsp; There was also a   description box provided below the option buttons.

Dr. Dr. Jeff   developed an Excel based chi-square calculation engine based on over 2,000 data   points.&nbsp; Calculations are automatically updated when new data is added.&nbsp;   Comparison data from this chi-square engine were used in analysis.

The answers to   questions regarding post-NDE religious preference were further categorized into   a religious shift, a religious change, or tabulated as no change.&nbsp; The   categories for &quot;too young&quot; and &quot;no response&quot; were not used since they would not   provide valid responses for the religious change analysis.&nbsp; This left 267   analyzable NDErs who responded to the question.&nbsp;

This analysis   recognizes the distinction between religion and spirituality.&nbsp; Those placed in   the religious shift category did not change their religion, but changed the way   they practiced their religion.&nbsp; People reporting a shift, were further scored   according to the direction of the shift.&nbsp; The first category was those reporting   a deeper faith, more spirituality, or avoidance of organized religion.&nbsp; The   second category consisted of those who returned to traditional religious   practices or who moved towards religion when formerly reporting little or no   religious practices before the NDE.&nbsp;

The criteria for   scoring a change were those NDErs moving from one religion to a different belief   system.&nbsp; Again, the responses were further tabulated into three categories   depending on the direction of change.&nbsp; The first and second category was the   same direction as used for analyzing a shift.&nbsp; An &quot;unknown&quot; category was added   for when there was not enough information in the narrative to tell in which   direction the change occurred.

Another analysis   involved the explanation responses to the question, &quot;Did you have any changes of   attitudes or beliefs following the experience?&quot;&nbsp; Out of 286 responses, 36   (12.6%) were no response.&nbsp; Out of the remaining 250 responses, 220 (88%) had   narrative explanations.&nbsp; Out of 220 narratives, 199 (90.45%) answered &quot;yes&quot; to   changed beliefs.&nbsp; These explanations were reviewed to see what beliefs changed   or what areas of life the answer focused on.&nbsp; Then the answers were categorized   into general areas of focus.&nbsp; Some people had several areas of focus, so may   have counted in several categories.&nbsp; Answers could be grouped into negative NDE   effects (5), Dying/mortality (66), Religious/spiritual (81), lifestyle   change(37), and paranormal events(7).&nbsp; Answers were further analyzed to see what   were the most common changed beliefs among NDErs.

RESULTS

Part of the study was   to determine how people categorize their religious preference after their NDE.&nbsp;   A prototype methodology based on theoretical and empirical work by Rosch (1978)   establishes a definition of what Rosch called &quot;fuzzy categories.&quot;&nbsp; These are   categories that have no simple classical definition and shade off into   conceptually related categories or concepts. 
  
  Religion and spirituality can be very fuzzy categories.&nbsp; The meaning of God,   Jesus, and Buddha will be very different depending who you talk to, and so will   the way individuals practice their faith.&nbsp; The extremes range from atheist to a   non-practicing member of an organized religion, to those who describe themselves   as religious or spiritual.&nbsp; As part of the survey, people were questioned about   their pre-NDE religious background and then asked what their religious   preference was after the NDE.&nbsp; Options were Conservative/Fundamentalist,   Moderate, Liberal, and a narrative response box.&nbsp; Out of 280 participants, 7   (2.5%) did not respond to the post-NDE religious question and 68 (24.3%) did not   respond to the pre-NDE religious preference question.

A coding system for   the responses to the open-ended question about religious preferences was devised   based on how NDErs responded to the question.&nbsp; The percentage of NDErs who   mentioned a coding category is as follows:

The largest religious   preference after their NDE was Christian (25.71%), followed by spiritual   (17.5%), and Catholic (10.36%).&nbsp; Prior to the NDE, the highest category   didn't   want to talk about religious preferences (24.29%), followed by Christian   (21.43%), Moderate (12.5%), and none (9.64%). &nbsp;

Out of 146   respondents, the majority of people in any category (65%) stay within the same   religious category regardless of whether they consider themselves conservative,   moderate, or liberal.

It is interesting to   see that the largest group of NDErs place themselves within the moderate   category (45.2%), while people who label themselves as conservative are 26% and   liberals account for 28.8% of the NDE population.&nbsp; This fact by itself is not   significant because each person subjectively placed themselves in a non-defined   category of conservative, moderate, or liberal.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it is interesting   to see how many people changed within each category.&nbsp; The trend being that the   more liberal a person is before the NDE, the less likely they will be to change   religions (16.7%).&nbsp; Conversely, the more conservative a person is before the   NDE, the more likely they will change religions (50%).&nbsp;&nbsp;

DISCUSSION

In a recent Dutch NDE   study headed by van Lommel, he noted that during the 8 year prospective study   that the life-change inventory had statistically significant values in the areas   of social attitude, religious attitude, attitude towards death and a category of   &quot;others&quot; (van Lommel, p. 2042).&nbsp; The social attitude listed the factors of   showing own feelings, acceptance of others, more loving, empathic, understanding   others, and involvement in family.&nbsp; Religious attitudes that were significant   included understanding the purpose of life, sense inner meaning of life, and an   interest in spirituality.&nbsp; The attitude to death showed a marked decline in the   fear of death and a belief in life after death.&nbsp; The other category consisted of   an interest in the meaning of life, understanding oneself, and an appreciation   of ordinary things.&nbsp; This study corroborates the findings of the Dutch study and   expands on these concepts.

When looking at the   expected and observed outcomes, the chi square test shows whether the observed   difference is due to chance or if it is statistically significant.&nbsp; The   lower the p value, the less the difference is due to chance alone.&nbsp; A p   value under .01 is usually considered statistically significant.&nbsp; The chi square test   yields some fascinating correlations between the following:&nbsp; 
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p   value

While it is no   surprise that changed beliefs would correlate with a life change, some of the   other correlations are surprising.&nbsp; The most plausible theory that fits the data   is that the perception of universal order and purpose after the NDE is the key   to understanding the changes NDErs go through after returning to earth.&nbsp; These   new understandings result in changed beliefs and life changes.&nbsp; The universal   order and purpose may be different than what we are taught here on earth, hence   the motivation for changes.&nbsp; Paranormal gifts may be part of the greater   universal order. We have a purpose for being on earth and we are not alone in   the decision to come to earth.&nbsp; Lastly, it is interesting to note that while the   category of &quot;religious background now&quot; did show statistical significance when   compared to the above mentioned categories, the p values were not as high and   ranged from 1.35E-03 for paranormal gifts to 0.20 for changed beliefs.&nbsp;   Therefore, it is plausible that &quot;religious preference now&quot; is not as important   as practicing the religion with the new spiritual understandings of the NDE.
  
  While causality cannot be drawn from these correlations, one can gain a sense of   how these categories relate to each other by reviewing the comments about   changed beliefs.&nbsp; The main changed beliefs that will be discussed are the   largest categories of dying and mortality, religion and spirituality, and life   changes.&nbsp; Since this paper primarily focuses on religion and spirituality, the   largest category will be discussed last.

Lifestyle change   comprised of the third largest grouping of answers (18.9%).&nbsp; Lifestyle changes   included answers about living life to its fullest and with a sense of purpose.&nbsp;   NDErs talked about living according to the golden rule of &quot;do unto others.&quot;&nbsp;   They talked about the importance of relationships, being kinder to others, being   more compassionate, stopping to smell the roses, service to others, and becoming   non-materialistic.&nbsp;

The second largest   group commented on dying and mortality.&nbsp; They talked about the lack of fear of   death and the certainty that life continues beyond death (33.7%).&nbsp; There are two   comments that sum up the common sentiments expressed on this subject:&nbsp; 1) &quot;Our   religions don't even come close to the experience, emotion or description of   love.&nbsp; The spirit self lives on.&quot; And 2) &quot;I don't fear death.&nbsp; I KNOW there is   existence after death.&nbsp; I know there is a beautiful, loving place beyond   death's   door that is waiting for me.&nbsp; I know kindness and true love is the key to   unlocking the answers to life.&quot;

As mentioned above,   the largest area of changed beliefs concerned religion and spirituality (41.3%).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   NDErs who talked about religion (13.8%) were mainly adamant about their renewed   commitment to their faith or a new found commitment that did not exist before,   representing 10.2% of the total.&nbsp; There were 3.1% of those comments that   were strongly anti-religious by denouncing organized religion.&nbsp; For two   people, they indicated that they already believed in God prior to the   experience.&nbsp; Interestingly, only one person returned to their faith because   they were convinced there was a hell.&nbsp;

According to Kimberly   Clark-Sharp, a noted NDE researcher and author, she indicated that she had not   met one person who had a negative experience who did not return to their   religion (Clark-Sharp, 2002).&nbsp; Of the 10 people who indicated that they   changed or shifted towards religion, as opposed to spirituality, only two had a   frightening experience.

&quot;Spirituality&quot; was   the changed belief that the majority of NDErs mentioned (27.6%).&nbsp; Comments   that were placed in this category were things like, &quot;I've learned to forgive, Also, I am   profoundly aware of the oneness of all, the presence of God, and that ALL of   creation is spirit!&quot; or &quot;I realized that life is too short to worry about   things, to love humanity, I have more compassion now, I don't feel afraid of   death.&nbsp; Life is a precious gift.&nbsp; The individual I was before the experience is   gone.&quot; Others commented on God, by saying &quot;NOW I KNOW THERE IS A GOD,&quot; &quot;There is   definitely a LIVING GOD no matter what anyone calls God,&quot; or &quot;I have become   closer to God and have no doubts about what lies beyond this world for us.&quot;&nbsp; The   comments had more of a feel of oneness, connection, universality, unconditional   love, and talked about God in a manner non-specific to any one religion.&nbsp;

Noteworthy, are the   comments about pre- and post-religious preferences.&nbsp; &nbsp;Out of 267 NDErs, the   largest category of NDErs (119 or 44.6%) reported no change in their religion.&nbsp;   However, many NDErs did tend to shift their beliefs in their particular religion   (78 or 29.2%).&nbsp; For 87.2% of these NDErs, the shift was in the direction of   spirituality.&nbsp; There was also a group of NDErs who changed religions (69 or   25.8%).&nbsp; Of those reporting a change, 71.0% changed in the direction of   spirituality, 4.3% changed to a more religious background, while 24.7% the   direction of change could not be determined based upon their comments. The   categories of those who shifted or changed in religion represents a total of   55.1% of the respondent total.&nbsp; Of this 55.1% of those who shifted or changed   religions, 79.6% of these people shifted or changed in the direction of   spirituality.&nbsp; This trend is consistent with the data above that shows the   marked change of spirituality that goes from 2 (0.71%) people as pre NDE   religious preference to 49 (17.5%) people reporting post NDE religious   preference as spiritual/universal.

There are a few other   trends that bear commenting on.&nbsp; &quot;Spirituality&quot; was looked at as moving from the   dogma of organized religion to actually living the spirit of the religion.&nbsp; It   is a bit ironic that Christians who changed to Buddhism considered this a more   liberal religion.&nbsp; Many people considered moving from &quot;religion&quot; to &quot;having   no religion&quot; as a liberal move.&nbsp; There were many people who considered it   &quot;spiritual&quot; to move from externalized organized religion, to their internalized   own form of spirituality, as a liberal change that is more in keeping with the   universal order observed from their NDE.&nbsp; Many people found that church was unnecessary   and concentrated on development for all people, and religions, with a tendency   towards universality.&nbsp;

For those who   answered &quot;none&quot; to the pre- and post-religious preference question, based on the   comments, one cannot say that these people are not spiritual.&nbsp; However, one can   probably say that they are not active in their religious practices.&nbsp; Another   factor could be response bias.&nbsp; Those that were affected enough by the   experience to tell someone about it would probably be more likely to share their   experience and to fill out the web survey.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Paranormal gifts,   such as telepathy, hands on healing, precognition, empathy, the ability to see   spirits, or any other such gift that may have been labeled as taboo by organized   religions, may actually be a part of who we are, rather than abnormalities.&nbsp; The   high correlation between universal order/purpose and paranormal gifts, could   suggest that paranormal gifts are a part of the universal order and purpose.   This would need to be studied further and is beyond the scope of this paper.

One aspect that   cannot be ignored is that the universal purpose and order seems to be more   defined in those that experience the tunnel, the light, reunion or meeting with   beings, and the life review.&nbsp; Typically, love is the one emotion that is   mentioned as the overriding message of the entire NDE.&nbsp; It would be interesting   to score participants based upon the Kenneth Ring's WCEI scale to see how   closely having a core experience correlates to spirituality.&nbsp; Again, that is   beyond the scope of this paper.

This study shows that   spirituality and religion do play a big part in the perceptions of NDErs.&nbsp;   They also provide a key towards integrating the NDE with the experiences on   earth.&nbsp; In many ways this is very exciting, because it puts NDErs at the   forefront of a spiritual movement.&nbsp; The categories of life change and   death/mortality are also features of religion.&nbsp; What NDErs say about these   categories follow with main tenets from major religions. We are taught to live   with a view towards our own mortality.&nbsp; Many think of heaven and hell, so   they live accordingly.&nbsp; Mostly, everyone learns several golden rules as a   child.&nbsp; Do these phrases sound familiar:&nbsp; &quot;do unto others,&quot; &quot;it is   better to give than receive,&quot; &quot;love thy neighbor as thyself&quot;?&nbsp; Many of our   core societal teachings mirror principals that NDErs affirm after coming back to   earth.&nbsp; On the other hand, there is a lot of resistance to change from the   status quo.&nbsp; These people cannot yet assimilate what, according to Peck, a   level three or four person might be trying to convey to them.&nbsp;

Unfortunately, those   who are at level one or two on the spiritual-growth ladder, will use the   standard rhetoric to discount the authenticity of NDE.&nbsp; They will do their   best to discredit research or to keep mankind from evolving through the   spiritual steps necessary for reunion with God.&nbsp; One would be hard-pressed   to find any middle ground between the different levels.&nbsp; However, I think   that we may be able to find commonality when one goes back to Peck's definition   of love in the introductory comments.&nbsp; Most people can understand that love   is nourishment of self and others, and thereby a spiritual act.&nbsp; The basis   for Christian ethics can be summarized by two rules, &quot;Love the Lord your God   with all your heart. . .&quot; and &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself.&quot;1&nbsp;   This may not be so far from what NDErs define as spirituality.&nbsp;

1&nbsp;   These rules were a statement of Jesus in Matthew 22:37-40 and Luke 10:25-8,&nbsp;when   he brought together two statements from the Old Testament, one from Deuteronomy   (6:5 &quot;Love the Lord your God with all your heart...&quot;) and the other from   Leviticus (19:18 &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself&quot;).      I'd like to give a hearty thanks to Rev. John Price for his editorial       suggestions.
