 1/1, January 1894-1927(?)  $1.00-$1.25  a year in America, $1.25 (5 Mark) in Germany, 24-40 pp.   Hartmann's Who's Who continued to list the journal as late as 1927.

  Herman Heinrich Schroeder (1863-1925) was a German-born publisher and bookseller in St. Louis and one of the earliest disciples of Malinda E. Cramer's Divine Science, of which this journal was an original proponent.  The advertisements for the journal in German called it without distinction  a "Monatschrift f√ºr die christliche Wissenschaft" (Neue Metaphysische Rundschau, 1898), but later amended that to read  "eine Monatschrift fur die gottlichee Wissenschaft und praktische Christenthum und geistige Heilkunde," and it was as "Practical Christianity" that Schroeder's version of New Thought spread in the United States.  Schroeder founded the First Divine Science Church of St. Louis, and was president of the Missouri College of Divine Science and minister of the church and the associated Society of Practical Christianity (or of Divine Science), which held services in English and German.  He was arrested in 1910 for practicing medicine without a license, although the charges were later dropped, and was careful to note in his advertisements: "Please Take Notice.  I am not a medical Doctor.  I do not give or prescribe Medicine.  I do not lay on hands or use Magnetism.  I am a Minister of Practical Christianity, a Teacher and Practitioner of Divine Science.  I give spiritual advice only.  I speak the Silent Word, the word of Truth and Life as taught and demonstrated by the Master, Jesus Christ."  On Divine Science, see the notes under Harmony and Divine Science Weekly.   The journal proclaimed its purpose as "to explain the universal truth of being, and to make it comprehensible to man, because knowledge and the word of truth frees from all falsity."  It contained the expected articles on "Truth and Health" ("There is Nothing to Fear"), "Memory Culture," "Love,"  etc., a Teachers' and Healers' Directory mainly consisting of what appear to be graduates of Schroeder's college, and contributions by those same teachers and by Paul Militz (whose works Schroeder published), Fannie B. James (the sister of Nona L. Brooks), Hannah More Kohaus, Ursula Gestefeld, Fanny Harley, Oliver Sabin, Josephine Verlage, and others.  The journal contained regular advertisements for Benedict Lust's New York Kneipp Nature Healing Institute, and for the works of Fannie B. James, Charles W. Close, M.E. Cramer, H. Emilie Cady, Annie Rix Militz, and others.  Noted or advertised in Harmony, 1896, The Life, January 1902, Theosophisches Leben, 1907, and in The Nautilus, 1917, Divine Science Weekly, January 1919.
