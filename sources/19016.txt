when I got involved in the issue of the
UFO issue in the et issue
I started in 1977 with President Carter
I realized that the work that I was
doing was characterized by the national
security state as a target for
counterintelligence activities when I
see this thing happening with this to
the Stars Academy where they suddenly
appear on the front page of the New York
Times and the CNN all of a sudden wants
to talk with them and they&#39;re on MSNBC
and all this kind of stuff I immediately
kind of realized wait a second
this is part of what I&#39;ve been worried
about coming out because they were
constantly spinning this story that this
is a threat my name is Tom DeLonge a lot
of people know me from my band blink-182
I started that band when I was 16
through a series of meetings I was soon
connected to a large group of US
government officials from the CIA the
Department of Defense and Lockheed
Martin skunkworks these guys were the
ones involved in the secret of US
government programs that dealt with
these subjects what&#39;s happening is the
to the Stars Academy people we&#39;re all
you know Jim Sammy van was there you
know the chief of covert operations
domestic for CIA which in and of itself
is totally against the law you know the
National Security Act of 1947 completely
clearly and unequivocally prohibits any
kind of covert operation stateside but
here that&#39;s who he is
and there he is there and you got the
guys from the DIA and the Defense
Department and helped put off and so in
there they&#39;re all there and and with
what they&#39;re doing is they&#39;re they&#39;re
putting this intense spin every single
thing they talk about all has this kind
of Gestalt to it that this is a threat
and it very well could be a threat it&#39;s
a threat to our national security it&#39;s a
threat to our airspace it&#39;s a threat to
our sovereignty it&#39;s it&#39;s what it is
it&#39;s a threat to our dominium over
our own planet and of course they think
that&#39;s their job our job is to assert
full spectrum dominance over the entire
planet we actually have the documents
from the 1992 the United States Defense
Department policy planning guidance
document where they said that right at
the end of the right of the dissolution
of the Soviet Union it&#39;s at all we&#39;ve
got to not cut back on our military
spending we have to increase it so we
can establish full spectrum dominance
