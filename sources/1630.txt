    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Good Health.
 The Oldest Health Magazine in the World -- Established 1866
 1866--1914?  Monthly
 Battle Creek, MI.
  Editor: John Harvey Kellogg.
  1/1, 1866.  48 pp.

 The journal was intended as reading material for patients at Kellogg's sanatarium in Battle Creek and as a lure to attract those interested in "good health" to visit the sanatarium and to buy Kellogg's books and health products.  On Kellogg, see also the note under Battle Creek Idea.  The journal was filled with diatribes against tobacco, alcohol ("Czar's Edict Establishes Prohibition in Russia--Only Good Result of War"), cane syrup, meat, polished rice, promiscuity (and sex generally), and encomiums for natural cornmeal, proper clothing, air baths, cereal coffee, etc.
