hello everyone this is dr. Steven Greer
and really happy to be with you for our
final segment this is the sort of
virtual online premiere of Close
Encounters of the fifth kind since we&#39;re
all at home we&#39;re just doing this from
our homes and I hope you&#39;ve enjoyed the
other people we&#39;ve had on the director
Michael Missoula and dr. Russell Targ
and Joe Martino and Daniel Sheehan so
this last segment will be shorter I want
to do just a short meditation for
everyone for universal peace so we&#39;ll do
a ce-5 meditation you see that I&#39;m ready
for at the end of that I&#39;ve been a party
hearty I got moderate Mardi Gras beads
and we&#39;re gonna have a little bit of
Prosecco and we&#39;re gonna toast but we&#39;ll
do that after we meditate let&#39;s meditate
first so again I&#39;d like to thank
everyone who supported the film
particularly all of you who contributed
to cg5 film calm and a crowdfunded this
made this possible it&#39;s a great
accomplishment all of you thank you so
much for all of your help we are number
one globally worldwide on iTunes already
and with your support and help and sort
of get in the word out on our behalf
let&#39;s stay there and I&#39;m hoping that all
of you also who see the film will get
the new ce-5 contact app that&#39;s the name
of it ce-5 contact and it has an entire
training program in it as well as a
networking feature kind of like a dating
app would have where you can see who&#39;s
in your area and click them on and begin
to chat with them message them and
create a CG 5 team and in the future
coming weeks will have some of these
livestream events about forming a team
and how to function out under the stars
what kind of amazing experiences you
might expect different kinds of it the
phenomenon that happened because there&#39;s
so much to that you know this to our
feature film to contain all the
information it would need to have would
have to be
a hundred hour film so hopefully in the
future now that I&#39;ve had our wonderful
team at pursuing X and Michael Moriarty
and Lorimer already helped me figure out
how to do this YouTube live program we
can do more of this going in the future
so you should get on your party beads
and if you have a boa we lost all our
Boas we had big feather boas we were
gonna put on but they all kind of fell
apart from a previous New Year&#39;s Eve
party but it&#39;s good to be silly it&#39;s
good for the heart and it&#39;s fun having
fun so what we&#39;re doing for the planet
is is awesome but we can have fun doing
it and I have found that when we&#39;re out
under the stars the sword is just being
silly after we&#39;ve done our meditations
is when the ETS often show up most
because they&#39;re very interested in
humans and they actually have a great
sense of humor so if there&#39;s nothing
wrong with having a good time and and
balancing the seriousness of what we&#39;re
doing with the beauty of being all
together in consciousness and then
playing and being playful with one
another and also with these interstellar
visitors who are with us so what we&#39;re
going to do now is I&#39;m going to lead a
meditation and that the purpose of this
meditation will do a breathing technique
first and then we&#39;re going to do a
meditation that will be focused on all
of us coming together inviting these
civilizations in universal peace to
interact with us so wherever you are on
the earth when I&#39;m going getting to the
part where I&#39;m showing them where we are
show the ETS where you are and if it&#39;s
nice enough to go out in your yard or
wherever you are go out and invite them
to come and visit you and if you do this
with a pure heart and clear intent
they&#39;ll do it they&#39;re really very
excited these civilizations that humans
are awakening to the power of
consciousness and in its infinite cosmic
component and that we&#39;re coming together
to do this and together we&#39;re going to
crease
eight this big transformation society
where we go from a broken society to a
society that is healed and becomes
interstellar into the future so that&#39;s
why we&#39;re here and the cg5 protocols an
initiative that you&#39;re all learning
about will enable all of us together to
move into the future and the future is
so beautiful it&#39;s a future where there
will be no pollution because we&#39;ll have
zero-point energy that will have a
peaceful civilization based on the
quality of the state of consciousness
that is a singularity of mind the pure
state of consciousness and will be in a
period of an age of enlightenment that
all of the ancestors before us have
spoken about and for thousands of years
seers have seen this time we&#39;re living
in then we&#39;re all very blessed to be on
this planet to contribute in whatever
way we can to the the creation of a new
world and you know that&#39;s how this
documentary film in sits me recounting
this experience that Colonel Corso had
when back in 1956 I was one years old
and this UFO came in at White Sands
Missile Range
during the broad daylight and they
tracked it on radar he went out in his
Jeep this craft landed and he came out
and had this meeting with this ETA that
after a few minutes of the craft
materializing and dematerializing
phasing in and out of space-time he then
connected to the et that could
communicate not only innately but also
technologically with thought and the et
was asking the colonel to turn off the
weapons systems that were piggybacking
on the radar systems which were exactly
a little more advanced type of what
happened in 1947 at Roswell when we
knocked down those et crap that crashed
there those were not accidental those
were deliberately downed a craft and so
this being a young army
the airforce Colonel he basically said
to the et that asked him to stop
shooting at them he said what&#39;s in it
for me and the et said a new world if
you can take it so here we are 64 years
later I would suggest two thirds of a
century later we evolved to where we can
accept the new world that has been for
stalled for so long and create a new
civilization on this planet that&#39;s what
we&#39;re doing with mass meditation and I
want to thank all of you for joining us
so what I want to do now if we can close
our eyes all of us together I&#39;ll lead us
into a meditation
take a deep breath and with our nose and
out with our mouth
with each inward breath we see our minds
expanding and we are relaxed and
centered and we see the prana the life
force the Chi of the breath of Mother
Earth filling our bodies with conscious
light and energy and with each
exhalation we become centered and
relaxed and exhale fully and see all of
your limitations and concerns drifting
off into the purifying breath of Mother
Earth and becoming quiet and calm and
that is
then deeply become awake and energized
let us exhale fully and relaxed an in
deep peace together and so being in this
relaxed state of consciousness let us
quietly observe the breath breathing
normally now and gently without
straining become aware of the conscious
mind watching the breath become aware of
awareness
and so without straining we allow our
mind to shift from watching the breath
to observing itself become aware that
you are awake and then behold that that
consciousness whereby you&#39;re hearing my
voice and perceiving yourself is a
singularity it is one and that everyone
on earth and every being in the cosmos
that is conscious and awake is awake by
the same single light a pure
consciousness infinite beyond space
eternal beyond time omnipresent
and so we behold this ocean of infinite
consciousness that is teeming with in
all things and is the foundation of our
own being and very gently we let go of
our attachment to the world and
ourselves
and gently go into that infinite ocean
of conscious light calm infinite pure
and in this beautiful consciousness we
behold that ourselves and all that
exists in creation or like ripples or
waves coming and going be merging rising
and falling from this one ocean of
infinite pure consciousness and we
experience the vast infinity within
ourselves that is always there and will
always be there
being thus centered in this pure and
quiet state of consciousness we see that
all beings are awake and just like a
beautiful cathedral with thousands
millions of pieces of stained glass
making a beautiful mosaic each one is
unique and each of us are its own unique
creation yet the light of consciousness
is one just as there is one Sun
illuminating every beautiful window in
this Cathedral of existence and so we
feel great peace and great calm as we
see that we are all one in spirit there
is one pure conscious field manifesting
within each of us
and now being centered in that knowledge
and then the experience gently become
aware of the space around you where you
are sitting and if you are with others
the people who are in your house and see
that they are conscious just as you are
awake but we are anchored into the
center of that vast infinite ocean of
conscious light and we see that we are
all phasing emerging from that great one
being and now let us be aware that the
space around us is not empty space but
the structure of space and time and all
matter is in fact pure consciousness
resonating phasing and it is all awake
and so let us rise upward above our
houses very gently and see where we are
from above in the sky and we behold
wherever we are our neighbors and the
land around us and as we gaze with the
eye of oneness that is awake now within
us we see that all beings and all who
dwell on earth are really part of this
vast ocean a pure conscious being and we
are not separate but always one and
further up into the sky so we see the
cities that are around us and the far
country side and gently rise upward into
the upper atmosphere of the earth and we
see that the earth is this beautiful
blue planet with about 8 billion people
and we realize that the earth herself is
a conscious intelligent being and she is
female and conscious and sacred and she
is aware of awareness even as we are and
thus we may be one with the earth and
then effortlessly we rise upward outside
the earth into space and we see the moon
which is full and it is the super moon
for 2020 and we see the other planets in
our solar system and the Sun and Mercury
and Venus and Mars and the beautiful
rings of Saturn and then we behold that
the entire solar system and every planet
within it is in fact pure cosmic mind
manifesting is worlds and the
consciousness within us and the
consciousness of the cosmic being a
space is one and if you wish to see any
place you need only connect to this
aspect of your own self that is infinite
and unbounded not limited by space or
time and so effortlessly we gaze across
the cosmos our solar system the near
star systems the Milky Way galaxy with
its spiral arms intergalactic space the
Andromeda galaxy which is a twin galaxy
of the Milky Way also spiral and as our
mind traverses the cosmos effortlessly
and playfully we see that all of this is
conscious and awake and the conscious
mind within us is always ineffably
always one with that same infinite
consciousness which is pouring forth all
worlds all beings all galaxies all
dimensions all realms and so it is we
are ambassadors to the universe and
wheresoever we may sense there is an
intelligent civilization capable of
reaching us whether it be in thought or
in light or in spacecraft we connect to
them and welcome them to earth and we
explain that we are ambassadors from
earth to their people and we invite them
here in universal peace the foundation
of which is universal consciousness and
so whatever
may come to your awareness wherever you
may see life in the cosmos greet them in
peace and invite them to join us in this
meditation and very gently show them the
location of the earth which is one of
the outer spiral arms of the Milky Way
galaxy and show them our star system and
the earth the third planet from the Sun
and just a zoom in effortlessly and show
them where you are
I show them who you are and who you are
with and invite them to manifest in any
way that is safe for this time in place
for them and also for us as we gather
together in this amazing time we live in
and then as we see them we asked them to
join with us in this meditation and
prayer but the healing of the earth and
humanity and with our hearts resonating
in perfect harmony with our minds and
our consciousness is infinite and our
hearts are made wide and filled with
infinite love we asked them to join us
as we gaze upon the earth and all her
beauty and all of humanity with all its
potential and asked that the healing and
peace be about Safet
to the earth and that we enter into a
time of universal peace on earth and
throughout the cosmos and as we gaze
upon the earth from our innermost heart
and this deep cosmic mind we ask these
interstellar sub was a
join us as we send a pure light of
golden healing and peace that permeates
the earth and all who dwell upon her and
wheresoever there is ill nnessee healing
emerging from within and wherever there
is ignorance we see the light of
knowledge dawning and wheresoever there
is conflict we see people turning to the
oneness of the great mind and that we
are all one in this infinite conscious
spirit and wherever there is greed and
the abuse of power we see those hearts
opening and turning transforming into
people who help all of humanity attain
its potential and where there is secrecy
and to heighten away from the benefit of
humanity sciences and technologies that
could heal and give us free energy and
solve the problems of the earth and the
burden we have placed upon her we see
those who wield that secrecy realizing
that this is the dawn and the beginning
of openness and transformation and as we
do this we gaze upon the earth with the
eye of oneness and with a heart filled
with kindness and we see the earth
transformed in such wise that as we go
forward from this moment we behold a
future where humanity will be
functioning as one and the earth will be
transformed and we will have open
contact with the people from the stars
who have been waiting for us for a very
long time and
so let us affirm that this is within our
ability and that we have seen this
future the good future that awaits us
and banish any doubt that it will come
to pass and as we come together as a
people to go forward in peace we will
find that the cosmos will greet us with
open arms and we will have before us a
new world a civilization that will go
forward for five thousand centuries
without war without poverty and we will
become an interstellar people so let us
hold that in our hearts and let our
actions and our words manifest this time
of enlightenment namaste
well thank all of you if you remember to
emerge back into your rooms from your
journey it&#39;s wonderful that we have made
it this far and I have no doubt we&#39;ll
make it the rest of the way shall we
together and so before I close we wanted
to end around 9:30 we&#39;re going to
celebrate I wish I had a bow wah but
next time we&#39;ll have a boa I know I&#39;m
very silly
my children are rather embarrassed why
not but we&#39;re also been a toast so if
you wish to have a little toast you can
do an astral virtual conscious one if
you don&#39;t have anything but my wife and
I and a friend that&#39;s here we&#39;re going
to have a toast and we&#39;re going to toast
to universal peace and to the beginning
of a new world and we are ready to
accept it bless all of you and here we
go
again thank all of you have a great time
with the CFI protocols go out under the
stars tonight or wherever you are and
hook up with other people through these
technologies that we have now where we
can be in isolation but still be
connected I&#39;ll talk to you all again
soon
and again thank you for your help
everyone who&#39;s been involved good night
