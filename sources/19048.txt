yes okay so um why don&#39;t we i&#39;ll just if
you&#39;re not driving
or bicycling or walking
close your eyes
and we&#39;ll just sit quietly for a moment
and take a deep breath in with your nose
and out with your mouth
very deep breath in with your nose
out with your mouth
deep
with each inward breath
become centered
and in the center of your forehead
see
the light of consciousness
be aware that you are awake
and with each exhalation
become very relaxed
and calm
and your whole body
and mind together are centered
and then let our minds follow our breath
very gently breathing normally
and just gently become aware
of the conscious mind watching the
breath
you are awake
and become aware that that awareness
is watching all things
and your breath changes
and your thoughts
and yourself
and the world around you
but the light of consciousness
is changeless
it is infinite
it is one
and as we go more deeply
let us see that this conscious field
that we are sensing
without straining just aware that you
are awake
is omnipresent
everywhere
and we have trapped it in our identities
and cells
but in truth
this conscious spirit
is without limits in space or time
and thus it is infinite
and eternal
now being subtly aware of this
consciousness
we see it as this vast infinite ocean
and that ourselves each of us are like
ripples and waves moving
on the surface of this infinite ocean
of light
consciousness
and now we can see
as we settle into the deeper aspects of
this ocean
that the entirety of creation
is emanating
from the pure field
of just conscious being
and that that conscious being
is us
we are all one in this spirit
and going now more deeply and relaxed
from the calmness of the depths of the
infinite ocean
of life and consciousness
we behold the beautiful earth
a blue planet
spinning in the vastness of space
and the planet itself
is a pure conscious field
and she is awake
and she is an organic living being
and we are all her children
sitting upon her
and so we turn to the great spirit
and to the mother earth
and father sky
and ask that the earth be healed and
humanity be healed
and that whatever afflicts humanity
dissolves
and goes away
like a snowflake
in the sun
and we are left with a pure and perfect
world
where we all live together as one people
one universe in peace on earth
and peace with all the civilizations
who are waiting for us
to welcome them here
and as we gaze upon the earth
from this beautiful deep place and
consciousness
we see a beautiful light coming from the
zenith of existence
and from the depths of deep space
enveloping the world in light
and enlightenment
in peace
and in healing
and we ask that the great spirit
heal all those who are afflicted
and guide each of us onto the path of
safety
in the days ahead
