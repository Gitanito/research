  		              		Experience Description   

    I remember feeling a sharp pain in my chest where the heart is located.

   Suddenly I was in something similar to space. It was dark all around me and I could not see my hands, feet, or any part of my body. It was like I was just a presence. Then, a beautiful and indescribable light appeared. I felt complete peace and love. I had no worries or fear. Two  angels appeared, one on either side of the light. They appeared to be just like the light, only they were in human form. They didn't have wings or anything like that. They were just beings that were made of the light. The light and the angels were so bright that it should have blinded me, but it did not hurt to look at them. Nor did I want to look away. It was the most beautiful, glorious sight I have ever seen. No words can accurately describe the beauty it held. One of the angels looked very similiar to my grandmother who passed away, but with a younger and more vibrant appearance. This angel that appeared to be my grandmother, motioned to me to come to her.  I began to rapidly accelerate towards the angels and the light. It was pure bliss. 
  
  Then all of a sudden I regained consciousness. Being back in my body felt painful, disgusting and awkward. I just wanted to go back to where I was before. I begged for God to just take me back. I did not want to be alive on earth any more.

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     After the experience I felt an immense need to seek God. I kept feeling the need to go to a church and just be there. Not during services. Just when the church was empty. To just be there with God. I did not go. The urge or need to find God became greater and greater. A few days after the experience, I just felt a sudden urge to get up and go clean my home office. I walked in and the first thing I picked up had a tiny new testament bible under it. I have no idea where this bible came from or how it got into my house. As soon as I touched the bible, I felt the overwhelming love and peace that I had experienced during the NDE. The feeling that I had been longing for since I regained consciousness. I sat down and opened the bible. The very first line I read was words that Jesus said. It was a verse about how the eye is the lamp of the body. I cannot explain how much understanding this one verse gave me, and I don't even have a clue on how it did. It just did. Instantly, it was like the breath of God filled my lungs. Colors that I thought I had seen before became more vivid and beautiful than I had ever experienced on earth. It was like going from watching a black and white TV to a color television. From that day on, I knew and know that God is real. I felt Jesus reach down and grab my hand. He held my hand and everything made sense. The same peace I felt during the NDE was felt. My life had meaning, and MY GOD was real.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I am a better person and because of this my relationships with others has improved  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   The experience was so different to what we experience on a day to day basis that it feels like no words can describe the extreme feeling of peace, love and beauty that was felt.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I do not know how my remembrance of the experience compares to my remembrance of other life events t    

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I gained an understanding of the bible that I never had. I had read verses before and it was just like reading words. It had no meaning. Now, I can read verses and just have a deep understanding of what God is saying.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Finding Christ and building a relationship with him is the biggest and most significant part to me. I was lost. Jesus found me, and now I am free.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    2-3 weeks. Their reaction felt to me like they did not fully believe me. It felt like they wanted to, but it was so out there they couldn't. I have only shared it with a few people, and none of them other than my wife knows all the details.
