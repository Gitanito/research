We were in an indoor pool. I kept getting pushed under the water. Every time I came up for air, I was sucked down into the water. I was fighting very hard to get air, then after so many breaths of water, my body just went down and my spirit just snapped out of my body (I felt a definite jolt out). Then I was on my way out drifting upwards at a forty-five degree angle and I felt that I was wearing a long pale blue robe/dress, so long it covered my feet. The next thing I knew I was at the poolside coughing and hacking and my mother was freaking out.


For the brief time I left, I didn't have any thoughts of lifetimes or whom I was leaving behind, just me leaving. Until then I considered myself agnostic. I grew up Catholic, but a reluctant one. It didn't make me religious or anything, but it did make me believe that there really is something after death.
