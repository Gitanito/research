I graduated from the George School which
is a private co-educational prep school
when Philadelphia
in 1958 and went into the military after
going through advanced infantry training
I was transferred to the Pentagon where
I work for the radiofrequency
engineering office I finished there and
I joined the White House Army Signal
agency in May of 1959
I served under Eisenhower from May of
1959 until he got out of office and I
served under Kennedy until I left the
service in August of 1961
I work with a Lieutenant Colonel
Holloman and I can&#39;t think of his first
name other than fact I think it may be
Earl but I can&#39;t I can&#39;t swear to it
anyway my job was to was to learn how to
deal with code and that&#39;s what I did and
when the process of dealing with that
through military maneuvers I learned a
lot about Project Blue Book Blue Book
was discussed quite openly in the office
sections of Blue Book were open for
discussion and then there were other
matters as well that that were brought
to our attention one afternoon when when
we were just about ready to finish up
training was about 3:30 maybe quarter
4:00 in the afternoon
Colonel Holabird brought out a piece of
what appeared to be metallic it was a
metallic piece of look like about he
looked like a yardstick it it had
deciphering it had had the encryption on
it
and the encryption was pointed out by
Colonel Holabird to each one of us who
were in the in that class and I think
there were six or seven of us at that
time and it was told to us where that
came from and this was in in connection
with Operation Blue Book what they were
trying to say is look we&#39;ve got this
this physical information this physical
property and to go along with what what
you&#39;ve seen in Blue Book we have now
been able to get our hands on and show
you materially and that&#39;s what that&#39;s
what he did they went on to further
explain that that this was the material
that had come from the New Mexico crash
in 1947
and in that was discussed I think it was
discussed at length if I&#39;m not mistaken
we spent perhaps another hour so we left
about an hour late that afternoon and
and the next day it was discussed again
they did discuss the fact that there
were bodies on earth extraterrestrial
bodies yes there were either three or
five and and and they didn&#39;t even know
at that point because some of the some
of the information that they had gotten
apparently was was incomplete but three
or five stands out in my mind is as the
number that that were taken they were
one was alive
partially alive at the time that this
happened and I do not know what may have
happened to him after that but the Army
Air Force was on the Air Force at that
time was very very much concerned about
Blue Book and there were strict
regulations involving anything that had
to do with the reporting of a UFO are
talking about a UFO if you wanted to
ruin your career and it was told us I
was an enlisted man I was the lowest the
lowest thing uh down on the totem pole
and that was made clear to us that if we
wanted to mess up our career the thing
that we could do fastest was to talk
about UFOs that we were being groomed
for top-secret and above and that and
that we we certainly would not be
cleared for any kind of of confidential
material should this be released you saw
an awful lot you saw a lot of pictures
most of the pictures we have seen
duplicates of today some were this
pictures that I saw were I think maybe a
little bit better they were taken by Air
Force pilots as welders of the UFOs yes
actually had pictures of
Oh indeed they did yes not only the air
force but but some were taken by
civilian pilots some were taken by
marine Air Corp pilots that&#39;s and then
some were foreign and it was it was made
quite clear that that that there were a
number of others that that were in place
in other agencies that were being used
at that time that were not being put in
the Bluebook I inferred from that that
perhaps those pictures were better than
the pictures that they were showing us
it was kind of grayish oil like maybe 8
to 10 inches long I can&#39;t remember
it seemed giant like when I saw it
because it was the first time I&#39;d ever
seen anything like this before and and
all eyes were just peeled on that
particular thing and when he told us
what it was it it was frightening it was
eerie there you could have heard a pin
drop in the room when when it was first
mentioned and what it was well he said
it would had been taken from one of the
craft that had crashed in New Mexico and
that had been taken from a box of
materials that the military was working
on and they didn&#39;t use the word reverse
engineering at that time but there was
something similar to the reverse
engineering they felt like they they
needed to work on and it was going to
take years to do this I do remember that
there was that at the at the Army
engineers Fort Belvoir that that that
they were doing a lot of experimentation
at Fort Belvoir that surprised me it
surprised me an awful lot well they look
like hieroglyphics it&#39;s hard to describe
hieroglyphics but but if you&#39;ve ever
seen any ancient Egyptian writings you
you know that that the hieroglyphics
were Anna
made it in some form and these these
appear to be animated that if I knew you
know the code that was supposed to be
used to find out how this languished it
was to be interpreted that I it was very
expressive you could tell it was
expressive he had a stainless steel box
with a lock on it almost like a
carpenter&#39;s box but maybe bigger and
that&#39;s where he got this from and that&#39;s
where he put it back and I gathered that
was not the only thing that was in that
box but that&#39;s the only thing he did
show I where this was in the
radiofrequency engineering office I did
not have any more contact with with the
subject matter of UFOs until after I
came in contact with present and then I
had heard that he did an awful lot of
doodling on paper on notebook paper
particularly at conferences that he
wasn&#39;t particularly happy with and he
would take the doodling and one of the
things he did he did doodle were various
forms of ufos referred in President
Eisenhower yeah I never saw Kennedy do
this but President Eisenhower did it and
he did it in my presence as well as
several other people who were attached
the White House Army Signal agency we
had one instructor a lieutenant colonel
and his his I guess his job was to not
only teach us but to make us believers
as well and that&#39;s that&#39;s when he
produced that piece of material from the
what appeared to be stainless steel box
it was a maybe a kind of a dusty gray
like foil that may have been burned on
look like it may have been burned on a
on a grill it was made clear that he
that that it was inferred
that that was not the only piece of
information that he had her that only
the only object that he had and he had
several others maybe the whole box was
filled I don&#39;t know but that&#39;s the only
piece he filled out and we reasoned he
did this was was to make sure that we
understood we were dealing with
something that that was totally out of
context from from what we had been
dealing with earlier and but that we
might be dealing with in the future I
think he intended for us to know that
that our futures were going to be
dealing with this subject matter more
and more he didn&#39;t describe them as
being symbols of of instruction and
that&#39;s as far as he would go but but he
didn&#39;t he did infer that that that the
instructions whatever they might have
been were something that that was
important enough for the military to to
keep working on on a constant basis he
made it quite clear that this was
something that was of grave importance
we were in the basement of the Pentagon
and in those days that was in 1959 there
was a tremendous amount of security
there in the base of the Pentagon and
anybody who&#39;s worked there knows what
I&#39;m talking about
you could almost carry on an entire war
in the basement and no one else would
know what was going on and the floors
above so that&#39;s how secure it was I was
working on top-secret I had gotten a
secret and by the time I finished the
school I had been given a top secret but
I was too given I was be given one step
higher than that and at that time they
didn&#39;t have a clearance specifically
dealing with this problem
if you dealt with a problem you got a
cue clearance which was which was a
nuclear clearance maybe later on they
decided they were going to change that
but that I remember that that was the
big question how are we going to to give
security to our security clearances to
these people have been through this
course there were probably 1500 reported
cases at that
that were I guess you&#39;d say eligible to
be printed are to be put in blue book
and the the the findings that were put
in there were highly scientific and they
were highly gone over by by the people
that that knew with knew what they
wanted to put in there
this information was information that
would never get out to to anyone else
but it was designed for the use of
particular military personnel and so
what was there was was extremely exact
and specific these cases were as
bonafide as they possibly could be they
were talking about people who who had
sterling reputations either in the
military or either in civilian capacity
in some form or another but but they
were not taking any loose cannons this
was this this was information that was
it was they they thought was extremely
accurate in this country during the
early 50s a numerous bases were built
where that would allow the President and
Congress and VIPs to go in case of
attack that is to maintain the
government on its on its level of being
able to function and so forth Mount
weather Virginia was was one of those
for Ritchie
Marilyn was another Camp David Maryland
and the Catoctin mountains was another
and there was another one in West
Virginia at that time which we only knew
is as concrete that was the code pay
amount whether for example is
is is underground it is it is designed
specifically to to be impenetrable as
far as then what we knew about atomic
weaponry was concerned but also there
was equipment up there and it was
specifically told to me when when I
first came there I first went on tour
there because we we had to go through
all these places where the president go
just to familiarize ourselves on what to
do and and how to do it but there there
was equipment up there to deal
specifically with with the UFO problem
now it was a standard up as a standard
out there was a standard operating
instruction and I don&#39;t know what it was
that would have been out of my out of my
category of work but but there was a
standard operating instruction on what
to do with you at UFOs had been sighted
around Mount weather not only on one or
two occasions but on numerous occasions
from one state they also have been cited
in West Virginia at the place I referred
to as his concrete stories about radar
lock on yes there were and and several
of those stories came out of Ohio there
was right wright-patterson Air Force
Base but several others came from
California
Texas Washington from what I can recall
but I would say there probably were
between two and three hundred cases of
lock-on and that&#39;s why those cases were
in there because they were authentic did
I ever hear that we had ever picked up
signals which which could not be
identified or but if they could be
identified were they coming in from
strange craft that that perhaps had
given us or put us under surveillance
and yes I did hear that and I heard that
from
numerous I wouldn&#39;t say numerous but at
least five maybe six reports that wound
up in Blue Book you know and these facts
several other of the reports had come in
through pilots radios with it in the so
whatever intelligence we were dealing
with at that time knew how to deal with
us they know how to communicate with us
but that they were of extraterrestrial
origin that was the belief I was told
that what they had there for us to deal
with came from the New Mexico site but
there were other sites and there were
other crashes they did not say where
they were not been pointed but but it
was made quite clear that that was not
the only site that they had gathered
information from and also material the
right the right wright-patterson Air
Force Base
was brought up on a number of occasions
that apparently there were more lock-ons
at wright-patterson that at any other
Air Force Base Edwards Air Force Base
was mentioned as an experimental station
and when I&#39;m going to say mention in
that context I I knew that it was it was
mentioned in the city in the area of
testing whatever they had found it was
said that that&#39;s what was being done
lock-ons
had come from Edwards Air Force Base I
found that in Operation Blue Book I was
there at the same time they feel of
course so was there when I first came to
work for the president I didn&#39;t meet him
until probably a month and a half after
I had been on board and at that time it
was a it was a very formal meeting and
the council&#39;s of government we must
guard against the acquisition of
unwarranted influence whether sought or
unsought
by the military-industrial complex and
after that I got an opportunity to
travel a little bit with the president
we we did some traveling towards Florida
he loved to play golf and I had an
opportunity to see him under fire as it
were and how he would handle certain
people that he didn&#39;t like and when he
did that he would doodle he was probably
one of the world&#39;s best dealers and
everybody would kid him I wouldn&#39;t I
wasn&#39;t a position to do so but but the
higher officers would would kind of say
little things every now and then and he
he just would smile and he keep on
doodling well some of those on some of
those occasions he had just been given
messages or just been given information
pertaining to sightings are pertaining
to information about UFOs and I know
that for a fact because I was in the
concept and I saw that information and
when he would do it it would excite him
beyond he was just he was just a kid I
and he would he would get so he would
get so excited and give orders like like
d-day was was happening all over again
he was very very interested in shapes
and sizes and and and what what made him
go I know that the White House itself
has a huge Compson in the basements run
by the Air Force but armies there every
place where the president would go
including Camp David has a comm center
that that deals specifically with with a
presidential traffic the president would
would continually on an afternoon or an
evening would continually get fed
information and it wouldn&#39;t be coming
from me it would be coming usually from
from a Warrant Officer why I&#39;m not
or how that works but but that&#39;s the way
it worked at that time usually it was
from a Warrant Officer so Chief Warrant
Officer had been in the Army for
probably thirty years of course and when
he would get that information he
sometimes would would close himself off
and he would be alone for a while and
then he would call him whoever he needed
to call in but dealing specifically with
UFOs I can only remember on one or two
occasions were where that information
came directly from the comm center to
him most the time it seemed to come it
was indirect most of that material when
it&#39;s passed through it&#39;s for its four
eyes only and that means that if you
have a direct interest in it then you&#39;ll
see it if you don&#39;t then you won&#39;t you
knew that there were sightings you knew
that there were new findings if you&#39;d
been around the president long enough
you could just judge by his expressions
what he was what he was reading and and
what interested him I mean it&#39;s just
something you you knew from from being
around him I would say that probably
that was among his highest of interests
at that time yes indeed it happened
quite frequently and I wouldn&#39;t dare say
how many times but it happened
frequently what happened was not one
particular agency could handle dealing
with with the entire subject matter
dealing from their engineering portion
to to sighting information to reporting
it in the Blue Book the whole process of
dealing with with with the UFO
phenomenon could not be handled any more
by one agency and so in order to keep it
alive and I guess as cheaply as possible
it was it was given to various and
sundry parts of the government to work
on and I guess they thought that they
could they could also keep the
intelligence
factor as secret as possible by by
giving little agent agencies a little
bit here and a little bit there and that
oftentimes is done with with matters
like this but but what happened was
Eisenhower got sold out the without him
knowing it he lost control of what was
going on with with the entire I think
with the entire UFO situation but I
think he was telling us the
military-industrial complex will stick
you in the back if if you are not
totally vigilant and I think he felt
like he had not been vigilant I think he
felt like he trusted too many people and
and I star was a trusting man he was a
good man
and I think I think that he realized
that all of a sudden this this this
matter is is going into into the control
of corporations that that could very
well be used in in debt remit to this
country we have been compelled to create
a permanent armaments industry of vast
proportions the total influence economic
political even spiritual is felt in
every city every state house every
office of the federal government I think
that their frustration from what I can
remember went on for months he he
realized that he was losing control he
realized that this this the phenomenon
of whatever it was that that we were
faced with was not going to be in the
best hands and that that those were them
as far as I can remember that was the
expression that was used it&#39;s not going
to be in the best hands that was a real
concern and so it has turned out to be
we recognize the imperative need for
this development yet we must not fail to
comprehend its grave implications I
would say that the government has done
as good a job through the installation
of abject fear as good a job on this as
they&#39;ve done with anything with within
the time of the memory of modern man I
really believe they&#39;ve done a job it had
been discussed with me on numerous
occasions talked about what could happen
to me
militarily and and what could happen to
me for even if I discuss this as a
civilian he discussed with me what
possibly could happen
should there be revelation is that what
your question was and he was talking
about being erased and I said Matt I
said what do you mean erased he said yes
he said you will be erased
that&#39;s how do you know all this there&#39;s
something to that effect and and he said
I know he said those threats have been
made and carried out he said those
threats started way back in 1947 the
army was given are the Air Force excuse
me was given the absolute control over
how to handle this this being the
biggest the biggest security situation
that that this country has ever dealt
with and there have been some erasers he
was very convincing and when he when he
said this and he was in a position to
know he was he was much older than I and
he had been involved with with the CIA
and then the DIA both and for them it
wasn&#39;t the
but he was he was involved in the CIA
and so I knew what he was talking about
he wasn&#39;t you know he wasn&#39;t just
kidding so I guess fear has done it I
don&#39;t care what kind of a person you are
I&#39;m care strong or courageous you are it
would be a very fearful situation
because they from what Matt said he said
they&#39;ll he said they&#39;ll go after not
only you he said they&#39;ll go after your
family those were his words
and so I can only say that the reason
they&#39;ve been managed to keep it under
wraps for so long is through is through
fear
they are very selective about how they
pull someone out to make an example of
and I know that&#39;s been done you can&#39;t
create anything positively through fear
fear feared only generates the human
soul and the human psyche the human mind
if you will end and that that will
eventually go away we have gotten so
much momentum with the secrecy that has
shrouded this subject matter that we&#39;re
liable to wind up in a big fat crash I
don&#39;t think that collectively we are
able at least as far as I&#39;ve been able
to determine and that&#39;s granted I&#39;m not
privy to the things that that I would
like to be privy to but but as I see it
when when you propagate a lie and
propagate a fear of the truth you put
yourself in a very vulnerable position
they&#39;ve been doing it for a long time so
evidently they&#39;ve they&#39;ve known how to
do it but at some point in time because
of the interest I think that the media
has taken there will be people coming
out speaking that have never thought
about speaking before particularly about
Nellis
and what&#39;s been going on
I think because what would be revealed
would totally destroy an economy that
was designed by certain capitalists in
this country a long long time ago to
maintain them and and their corporations
From Here to Eternity and I think that I
think oil has a special interest in
seeing that it maintains its position
where it is regardless of what kind of
pollution regardless of of what
disastrous side effects may may have
occurred and continue to occur I think I
think that that what we&#39;re dealing with
is we&#39;re dealing with certain
electromagnetic devices that that are
powered by by sources that we that we
just don&#39;t quite understand as of yet
well where it&#39;s certainly not
advertising them anyway but that these
sources would would be in free power and
free power is something that that
corporations panic about I think there&#39;s
government panics about it you know how
are you going to tax free power looking
at it from a from a governmental point
of view and from everyone that I&#39;ve
talked to who knows something about this
subject matter
they do believe that that the sources of
energy that keep these vehicles in
propulsion are sources of energy that
that are just as free as free can be and
they don&#39;t cause any harm to the
environment they don&#39;t cause any
footprints to be left anywhere I given
given the fact that we&#39;re having a real
question about how to deal with the high
price of Arab oil right now bushes is as
you know is trying to insist that we go
into some of the Arctic regions and and
take more oil out I for one don&#39;t see
that as as an answer I think that would
I think that would be totally with the
situation but
but but the global warming situation
being what it is that would just be
another it would just be another nail in
our coffin but at some point in time and
I don&#39;t know when that will be but at
some point in time we are going to have
to be faced with with a sharing of this
information that will allow us to have
free energy if you will a graduate
student in college dealing with physics
understands that that there are certain
curves where where this this speed
factor does not mean a thing that
certain curse might occur factors in
space that time and space take on a
totally new dimension the government
knows this this this it&#39;s foolish for
them to try to make the rest of us look
like imbeciles and saying that this
can&#39;t happen what can happen I need to
wait in them and
vehicles of that kind and I was ninety
nine nine ten percent sure that the
Russians didn&#39;t have any of that type
either so it certainly there were
certainly was at that point in time
there was no doubt in my mind that this
vehicle was made at some other place
than here on earth
