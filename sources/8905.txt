At first base the third baseman threw the ball way over my head.  I jumped up to catch it anyway.  When I came down, my jaw landed on the top of the onrushing runner's head.  I vaguely remember standing up.  I was told that I mumbled, 'I'm okay.  Let's keep playing', but there was a lot of blood and I was clearly not okay. Then I vaguely remember the feeling of being in a car and feeling my mouth feel out of place.

  The next thing I recall, I was looking down at myself sitting on the bench of the emergency room.  The girl who brought me over was seated next to me.  A doctor was kneeling in front of the 'me' on the bench, moving my mouth around.  He said the jaw was broken clear.  I later found out the left side was also broken in pieces. As I looked down, I was aware of an endless continuum behind me, but I did not turn around.  Indescribable, all-encompassing love surrounded everything.  It was perfect peace and well-being beyond imagination. There was someone or something communicating telepathically with me.  It's hard to explain the feeling of intimacy, care and connection I felt with it.  We were almost one, but what was behind me was so much greater than me. Looking down at 'me' on the bench, 'we' felt such compassion for the poor guy.  He didn't know that he was surrounded by love.  Telepathically I heard, 'If only the dear one knew how much he was loved!', and I agreed.  I stayed up there for a while and then suddenly returned to the body.

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          All of it.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Some years later.  At first, I was somewhat embarrassed to talk about it because it did not fit my world view.  I've told it selectively to those I thought would be interested.  They were very moved.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     It seemed a lot realer than everyday life.
