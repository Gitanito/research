thank you one of the things I wanted to
get into and when you when you look at
this Atacama humanoid and you look at
the density of the bones and this is
this is something it&#39;s a little medical
and technical but stay with me
everyone&#39;s heard of osteoporosis were
right when your bones become thinner
don&#39;t have as much calcium in them as
they need to have and take supplements
when you have a womb fetus in the womb
there&#39;s no Travie T it&#39;s like it&#39;s in a
one of those floating chambers the fetus
is just floating in fluid it&#39;s called
amniotic fluid and there&#39;s not a lot of
calcium or bone density and when the
baby is born having delivered many
babies and take care of trauma in babies
that have been in terrible accidents
their bones are almost like Gumby bared
they&#39;re like dumb beasts they&#39;ve been
they&#39;re flexible because it&#39;s mostly
cartilaginous material as opposed to you
know hard bones that crack and break
does this make sense the reason for that
is that they haven&#39;t been up walking
around bang bang bang moving where and
there it&#39;s a developmental phenomena so
one of the things that dr. Lachman
observed in the radiologists in Spain in
Barcelona who were excellent observed as
soon as the images just x-ray images
came off we did those before the cat
scan they said oh my god what the hell
is this I remember them gasping because
the bone density was that of a normal
child it wasn&#39;t of a fetus going to size
six inches they were assuming this was a
fetus and when they looked at the bone
density they said well there is
absolutely no way this is a fetus that
was aborted or a miscarry this
absolutely
it was a organism that was up moving
around because the other thing is that
there there are cells called osteoblasts
that when you this is why people is to
get older if they walk around more they
stronger bones because osteo osteoblasts
are stimulated to lay down more calcium
by walking and moving and working out so
why it&#39;s important for people those of
us getting older to stay active now what
you know what people don&#39;t understand is
that a fetus the the x-rays if you go to
look at fetal x-rays you can do this on
your own google it you will see that the
bone density of those versus this
Atacama humanoid are vastly different
any radiologist medical doctor looking
at those even a radiology tech will go
this is not the x-ray of a deformed
fetus . so when we knew that it wasn&#39;t a
big fetus that was rejected by the time
we got the x-rays out of the machine in
2012 in barcelona and gary knew it and
dr. Lachman who was the world&#39;s expert
on this let me explain dr. Lachman and
stanford literally wrote the textbook on
skeletal abnormalities in children
literally wrote the textbook renowned
globally he said that it was a six to
eight year old child from not only the
bone density but also the Epistle place
where the bone when your bones are
growing there&#39;s still plates that are
open so it can get bigger and bigger
because you&#39;re still growing
now the and in his comments which we
will post he states that well there are
some rare genetic conditions called
progeria where your bones age faster so
maybe that&#39;s not the real age but he
says i seriously doubt it he says point
blank in this particular specimen he
doubts that he did not yes yes this is
this is in his report word-for-word
i&#39;m quoting from the report I held up a
moment ago that it was a six-inch
specimen that was six to eight years of
age by both the
density now the fact that they&#39;re saying
this was an aborted or miscarried fetus
that spontaneously like when a woman has
a miscarriage is that is laughable the
medical evidence and the world&#39;s expert
on this and any radiology worth their
grain of salt a grain of salt would say
this is ridiculous it&#39;s junk science so
now we get to the question of how do you
go from that to a major medical journal
like genome research putting in this
kind of misinformation to the public and
one of the things that was pointed out
to me in my telephone conversation with
this world-renowned jettison genesis is
that he he said that when he said I want
to review the peer-review statements now
often when you do peer review in a
journal the identities of who reviewed
it are kept secret because they don&#39;t
want to be attacked for having you know
not accepted your paper but the
statements they make are generally made
available so that you can see what
people said about it the senior editor
at genome research refused to give this
renounce geneticist the comments and the
review itself how this was how it was
peer reviewed what are they keeping
secret he knew that there was something
very fishy there because apparently it
must have been a junior editor who
slipped this into this prestigious
Journal and now they&#39;re running scared
at genome research magazine the he also
says that someone walking off the street
into Stanford maybe could have made
these mistakes on the sequencing and the
fact that these old DNA is damaged but
anyone would have done the controls and
not reach these conclusions
he&#39;s he said that they were obviously
cherry picked and had a millions of
changes in the DNA they picked about 60
to create this predetermined hypothesis
and he said it would be headline news if
there was one new genetic syndrome found
in the living specimen that they are
claiming that there are seven of them is
laughable and implausible on quoting the
data does not support the conclusions of
that paper at all
so I think that this gets into the
question of there&#39;s been a breakdown in
the peer review process there&#39;s been a
breakdown in oversight at Stanford
there&#39;s going to breakdown in the people
at publishing this but also the science
writers if you&#39;re a science writer for
The New York Times or The Washington
Post or CNN you should have asked people
is it plausible that this unusual
looking creature that had all this other
evidence from dr. Lachman from the
radiologists the cat scans is actually a
fetus that was miscarried they would any
if that data were put in front of any
competent doctor medical doctor they
would&#39;ve said no this is ridiculous and
if they had anyone who would have gone
through now granted it took four days
for this world-renowned geneticist to go
through the data files to see where the
errors were made and where the
cherry-picking happened and this caused
him to conclude that what they did is
that they had a foregone conclusion
which we know they did because dr. Nolan
made statements to the public in 2012
if 2013 when the movie serious was
coming out
it&#39;s a deformed fetus I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s a
deformed human it&#39;s human in the
discussion and that was reported in
science magazine and everything
Caressa discrediting campaign against
people who are trying to be truth
tellers and feel what&#39;s going on like
why would you even undo it well for the
mainstream public I don&#39;t think there&#39;s
any undoing I mean we are irreparably
damaged here because the the scientific
journals and the mainstream media have
colluded on what is I think one of the
largest scientific misinformation
campaigns in modern history I am not
exaggerating to say when you have
something that could potentially be we
don&#39;t know I want to say there&#39;s no
proof yet that this is of an
extraterrestrial origin but even if
there&#39;s a 1% chance it is to have the
DNA sequencing be altered to have known
science thrown out such as the fact that
something laying out in the desert is
going to have changes in the DNA
sequence that are not naturally
occurring mutations on the bones that
cause the bones to look like this or the
creature to look like this but are the
result of just normal degradation and
decay this is settled science this is
how do you make these wild spurious
conclusions which are published in a
mainstream journal and then covered
globally and is case closed
the case is closed yes they believe them
well here&#39;s what I think I I think that
there&#39;s hope only because a large
majority of the population doesn&#39;t trust
the media a large percentage of the
population has begun to question these
authority figures now unfortunately we
used to have the Citadel&#39;s of truth
where our prestigious scientific
institutions and what I&#39;m worried about
with this and this is why I&#39;m asking
people to context
Purdue University and Janome researching
Cold Spring Harbor which at Cold Spring
Harbor is the facility and institution
that Watson and Crick founded to where
they&#39;ve discovered and the DNA molecule
and and express their deep concern over
the possibility that the peer review
process broke down that this then made
it into the global media and that the
conclusions that are in the paper
there&#39;s a scientist in the LA Times who
said who openly questions the
conclusions he says this is dr. Matthew
Worman an expert on skeletal genetic
disorders at Boston Children&#39;s Hospital
and Harvard cautioned that although the
researchers identify known and novel
genetic variants they are farmer from
knowing what role if any they played in
oddest many abnormalities is possible
the genetic variants identified in the
new research could be responsible for
one or more of these events but if he
were advising oddest bereaved parents or
immediate relatives on her genetic
condition and told them about their risk
I would be very cautious to use any of
the data presented in this paper to draw
any conclusions
now this is one of the renowned this is
in the LA Times those of you if you can
read for god sakes read this here&#39;s my
point
I&#39;m trying to rest what we&#39;re doing on
truth-telling and facts fact that
world&#39;s expert in skeletal abnormalities
said it&#39;s six to eight years old fact
the radiologists have said that it could
not be a fetus because of the density of
the bone material fact dr. Nolan himself
thought it was something extraordinary
until two unconcerned reports of federal
agents approached him and he changed his
tune 180 degrees fact there were no
controls done for this study which the
world-renowned geneticist has said would
have rendered it thrown back if you were
just doing your PhD and didn&#39;t even have
a chair the Harris chair at Stanford the
paper would have rejected with a zero
grade he said because there were no
controls done on the study and that the
conclusions were based on cherry-picking
sequencing that is almost certainly the
result of oxidation and damage to the
genetic material and then on top of it
to say there were that many major
genetic syndromes in one conception if
when one fetus it would he said the bad
amount of genetic damage would have
resulted in its inability to even divide
once as an embryo in other words to go
from a single cell
zài god into an embryo it couldn&#39;t have
even divided nevermind been miscarry or
born so none of this adds up and so the
only conclusion you can reach is and he
states stated this to me it&#39;s the level
of incompetence of the science
scientific data is so great that you
have to conclude one of two things
either a big trick is being played or
there is massive scientific incompetence
either way this is a major major story
we need to get to the bottom or I am
called as the head of the global
disclosure movement and a medical doctor
myself and a scientist I am calling for
a major federal and state investigation
of Stanford University
UCSF Cold Spring Harbor and Genome
Research magazine and their peer reviews
process and I am asking all other
scientists who have the ability to
review this paper objectively and the
data objectively and to review the paper
that was published in 2006 that is
settled science about how much DNA
degrades and fall apart falls apart with
us and when it&#39;s in the environment to
to get them involved with this because I
do not have a PhD in genetics
and the way this is going to rest right
now to answer your question is that my
opinion is not going to be reported I
had the Washington Post in National
Geographic magazine both interviewed me
about this report and I explained all
these problems to them not a single word
of what I said appeared in the media not
one word
except on your show Thank You Carol that
you are the only person that has allowed
me to explain what our objections are to
what could be one of the biggest
scientific mishaps in history because
we&#39;re not dealing with
oh well that you know they miss cute
something on an unknown primate
this could be a huge story that we were
hoping could have broken wide open the
possibility that were not alone in the
universe and there are other species of
human-like creatures and the fact that
there is this Russian now we need help
from Russians to get the this specimen
that was a big one it was like this
large it was it was a full-grown it it
was not if it was bigger than you had
had and even a newborn baby and yet the
state examiner in Russia debunked it and
said oh it&#39;s it was an aborted fetus
girl again interesting they were all
aborted fetus girls what is this I mean
they put the thing that was said in 96
and what was said in 2018 are the same
cover story it makes no sense but I
think the idea for being an aborted
fetus girl came from somebody who knew
how the trip was played by these black
projects in Russia because remember
there are unacknowledged special access
projects in the US and Russia that are
hand in glove that work together it&#39;s
global and there are scientists in in
Russia that are victims there are
politicians who are victims just like
there are the United States and this
gets into the whole question of we&#39;ve
got to have disclosure and a full
investigation of this corruption not
just here in
United States but all over the world
this is happening all over the world and
it and one of the things that we need to
I want to share is an email I got from
one of the most senior cia people in the
history of the UFO subject I do not want
to share his name because he still
actively involved behind the scenes
assisting us this is one of the reasons
I&#39;m still alive I won&#39;t go into it any
more than that
this is one of the reasons I&#39;m still I
have not been successfully assassinated
and he wrote to me about this group that
on December 31st this to the Stars
Academy group and his first email was
very sweet because he said I hope you
have not been negatively impacted by TT
si I anticipate it will dissipate soon
that was on December 30th of 2017 and
then he said when I wrote back no I&#39;m
doing fine I was expecting this this is
why I did the movie unacknowledged and
the reason I did the book unacknowledged
was because we wanted to have this
information in the public before they
started running their scams
because I knew it was coming because
what they were doing is that they were
going to start doing a fake disclosure
that portrayed the aliens as a threat
that would then create the foundation
for war in space and World War 3 which
in 1955 if you read Douglas MacArthur&#39;s
speech he said World War 3 will be
interplanetary that we need to unite the
nations of the world Ronald Reagan said
we need we can unite the world around an
alien threat this has been worked on for
70 years they have had a 60 to 70 year
plan long-term plan to plort plate play
the fake alien threat card and we&#39;re
seeing it before our very eyes you and
I&#39;ve talked about this for debt for two
decades but they with this literally
we&#39;re watching this play out before our
very eyes so here is this email that I
get that
today he says I&#39;m glad to hear all this
find Steve I have watched that rat pack
referring to these people that I named
on the TTS a group I have watched that
Rat Pack run scams against the US
government loony billionaires referring
to Bigelow and now the average citizens
keep up the good work I have been
studying this subject for over 35 years
this is one of the most senior people in
the CIA on the committee dealing with
UFOs and ETS literally this man whose
name I will not disclose at this point
and while I&#39;m still alive was the man
who after i briefed the director of the
CIA for Bill Clinton was asked to go
into the Oval Office to clean up the
mess when it was found that this subject
was real and that the president and the
CIA director at that time was being lied
to about it so this is the man who now
one of the other interesting things
about this is that if you if we can get
more scientists to go on the record you
were mentioning some that are contacting
from Bolivia and study the details of
the scientific report it&#39;s going to be a
house of cards because I think the man
that I have been getting all this great
information from who is very famous
doesn&#39;t want to be associated with the
scientific scandal like this but we need
people who will be associated with it
because it&#39;s hard to take
Janome research magazine which is the
premier peer-reviewed magazine in the
world is hard to take on Stanford
University it&#39;s hard to take on the
federal government but this is what I
have been doing for as you know 28 years
it&#39;s a very lonely place I need help
I&#39;m making a call for other scientists
to come in please help us with this
process and I think that one of the
things that we find is that when you
look at the data that was put forward by
dr. Nolan&#39;s team and then passed through
to this ridiculous Journal article which
should have been returned from the peer
reviewers with a zero grade you find
that there is we have to we have to find
out and I&#39;m not I don&#39;t I want to be
careful I&#39;m not going to say that there
was deliberate fraud here but there was
certainly many errors there was errors
in the analysis there was lack of
controls done one of the controls he
talked about doing would have been
before you did any of the other
sequencing of the DNA is to do a very
simple direct test of how many errors
there are in the base pairs of the
genetics meaning how many cytosine
switched over to at is or what have C to
a and T and what have you if you look at
the molecule he says there are very
inexpensive electrophoresis and gel
studies that can be done that any
competent lab would have done instead
what they did they used a computer
program that does it indirectly that was
able that you can then fudge the numbers
to show that there&#39;s less the damage
he&#39;s saying this would be an easy thing
to do but now I bet all this genetic
material went to Stanford and how are we
going to fix this how am I going to fix
this problem so we have to have people
who are going to go in and say look the
the conclusions that are reached and the
methodology used is not
correct now the there needs to then be I
think a criminal investigation and I&#39;m
going to go out on a limb here but I
think there needs to be a criminal
investigation into the peer review
process of Cold Spring harbors genome
research magazine Stanford University
and UCSF and the reason I do is that
this preeminent scientists has said
there is simply no way that any
competent scientist would make these
kinds of errors and there&#39;s no way that
a journal should have let this get
published and then because of the
prestige the prestigious nature of the
journal and the prestigious nature of
Stanford it got worldwide news which is
now submarined completely torpedoed what
we&#39;re trying to do with the disclosure
project this is something we also need
to assemble a legal team so if there are
any people out there who are
investigators who are competent
litigators who are proper who and any
federal authorities FBI and National
Institutes of Health investigators
because much of the funding that goes to
Cold Spring Harbor and Stanford is from
NIH our tax money our tax money is
paying for this and I think the public
should be outraged in America that this
report made its way into this
prestigious Journal and institution that
is being funded by grants from me at you
taxpayers and also Stanford much of that
research since none of these
universities is coming from the US
taxpayers from the US government much of
it most of it and to have something like
this happened where one of the most
prestigious scientists in the world on
in the DNA area with a PhD from Caltech
stated to me now I can&#39;t make this
conclusion this is his statements that
this is a trick
this is pulling a rabbit out of a black
hat there is no foundation for his
conclusions at all but this scientists
from
bird who is saying that you can&#39;t reach
these conclusions because anyone who
does ancient DNA research let me just
back this up let&#39;s say that you&#39;re a
specialist in archaeology you might be
able to determine whether something&#39;s
male or female maybe from the old
degraded DNA you would never claim you
have seven new genetic syndromes never
before seen in combination in the world
that would result in this phenotype
phenotype meeting the physical expressed
form of the genetic code no one nobody
in archaeology de janeiro one in ancient
genetics no one with competent
scientific credentials and trust me the
people who were doing this at Stanford
dr. Nolan and his colleagues are very
competent so how can you you can&#39;t say
whether it&#39;s complete incompetence
because the people are copy there has to
be an element of something very dark
going on here possibly I say to a living
organism to an organism that was a
living organism it cannot be done that&#39;s
what that paper in 2006 stated and that
you might be able to speculate but you
couldn&#39;t reach hard conclusions you
might be able to say maybe this
alteration is a mutation that occurred
naturally but it might have been just
because the DNA decayed was falling
apart sitting out in the desert for over
a hundred years the point I&#39;m making is
that no competent Sciences would have
reached those conclusions who has a
passing superficial knowledge of ancient
DNA that&#39;s been degraded but at the same
time very interestingly a very
inexpensive test that should have been
done at the first part of the research
which would have been the control would
have uncovered how much of that DNA they
were sequencing had damage in it oddly
that wasn&#39;t
published and yet the I think it might
have been done initially because the
first emails I got from dr. Noland were
that it was only 91% matching to humans
now he&#39;s claiming it&#39;s 98% but that&#39;s
through this indirect measurement not a
direct measurement so has there been
manipulation of the methodology and the
statistics and the bioinformatics all of
this is suspect it&#39;s all very suspect
and there needs to be a full
investigation by people who have
competency in these areas which frankly
I am a clinical medical doctor now what
I do have competency on is to say that
this is six to eight years old now he&#39;s
claiming that it was in the womb as a
fetus and that this progeria gene caused
it to age as if it looked six to eight
years of age while it was still a fetus
well this is nonsensical because the
bone density would not have been there
at that level and that this combination
of progeria
you
