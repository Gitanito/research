  This journal was started with a view to the coming centenary of the Theosophical Society and with the recognition of the many problem areas in contemporary Theosophy:  "Much that is good, much that confirms the early promise.  But how much has happened that is not good, that never should have happened?  And how much still remains dark and murky in areas of Theosophical policy and effort?  Wisdom and vision demand that achievement and error, and fruit of both, be recognized and assessed, that from their study tuition be gained.  Today's clear light can offer challenge to us all to make renewed and valiant effort to better our great Movement, to free it from its areas of disrepute, to make it in every way respected and loved and wanted by millions crying for light and guidance."  Although the journal was an effort of the Theosophical Society begun by Katherine Tingley it openly requested the cooperation of and contributions by all the varied Theosophical groups, and published also selections from Madame Blavatskyâ€™s lesser known writings and by many of the early members of the Society.  The journal contained contributions and selections by Michael Gomes, Iverson Harris, Ted G. Davy, John Coats, L. Sprague de Camp, Sylvia Cranston, Jerry Hejka-Ekins, Paul Johnson, John Cooper, P.G. Bowen, G. Farthing, Jean Overton Fuller, and others.
