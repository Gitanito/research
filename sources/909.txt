    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Temple Mystique, Le.
 Revue de la Franc-Maconnerie.
 1854--1856  Monthly
 Paris, France.  Language:  French.  Editor: Jacques-Etienne Marconis de Negre.

 1/1, October 1854-June 1856.   10 francs a year, 32 pp.

 This was the journal for the collection of high-grade Masonic rites that Marconis de Negre (1795-1868) claimed to have brought under his control, most importantly the Rite of Memphis of 90 degrees (later 92-96 degrees) that Marconis had started in France in 1838 or 1839 and of which he became Grand Hierophant.   This, along with the sometime-competing Rite of Misraim from which it was derived, was an “Egyptian" rite that attempted to move Masonry along the lines laid down by Cagliostro’s Egyptian Masonry of the previous century, emphasizing the creation of the interior Mystic Temple, the Oriental and Hermetic origins of Masonry, and the transmission of initiation through hierarchies of adepts stretching back to antiquity.   The rite struggled to succeed in France but was established by Marconis in Egypt, Naples, Romania, and other countries--and in the United States, whence, after innumerable transformations, it found itself taken up by John Yarker in England, who transmitted it (conjoined with the Rite of Misraim) to Theodor Reuss, “Papus" (GErard Encausse) and others as the  underlying structure of various forms of modern occultism.  The journal, unlike its predecessor, emphasized the practical ritual of the lodge rather than the mystical basis of the rite.  BNF; BL.
