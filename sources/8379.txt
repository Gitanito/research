  		              		Experience Description   

    The first time I hung myself in the bathroom. Suddenly, I felt out of my body. I was floating and I could move my body but I couldn't turn around.  I presumed that I was dead. There was nothing interesting about being dead. I sensed hours passing and I was kind of sleeping.  Suddenly, I heard my name being called from the most beautiful voice I ever heard. The voice was soft, profound, soothing, and loving as it called, 'Adrian.' I tried to turn and look toward the voice, but I couldn't move. Again, 'Adrian.' I answered, 'Yes, I'm here.' 'Do you know what you have done?', I heard. 'No and I don't care,' I replied. Again the voice called, 'Adrian.' I felt wind.  The wind was very soft and it began to blow slowly. Everything was black; no flashes, nothing but darkness. Some thoughts crossed my mind. 

  Then some luminescence began to shine. Then, I saw the faint light as it changed to two lights and something square among them.  Then I saw three lights and some shadows on the left side. Then it was four candles around a casket.  The were three shadows, one was standing and the other two were kneeling. The voice asked me, 'Is this what you want?' I answered that I didn't care. The soft wind blew on me again again, closer to the shadows. I felt their pain and heard them sobbing.  The shadow who was standing was my father and my mother was kneeling. The other kneeling shadow was my grandmother who died two or three years before. I never thought of that and cried to return.  The wind blew again.  I woke up wet and with throbbing pain on my head. The pipe broke and I was on the floor.   
  
     The second NDE, was in May 1982. I was driving and my car engine died. I got out of the car to check itout to fix it. Somebody got out of the car behind mine, maybe trying to help.  But, I didn't trust him. Something happened and, suddenly , the driver of the other car came out, looking for a gun. Some comments were made. I went to my car to start the engine.  He was there with his revolver. I got out of the car and he shot me.    In the hospital they send me to emergency surgery. 

Suddenly I woke up. What a beautiful day! What a light! There was a very pretty river to my left, and an interesting desert to my right. I kept walking near the river and turned to look at it. Across the river was a river beach.  Beyond the beach was an incredible forest. I tried to see the sun, but couldn't turn around. I kept walking and began to ask myself how thirsty I would be later in the walk. I kneeled to drink from the river. As I got water in my hand and almost to my mouth, I heard a voice.  It said, 'Don't drink that!' It was the same voice from the first NDE. I dropped the water, got up, and looked around.  But I didn't see anybody so I kept walking. I was thinking, 'What a beautiful forest.'  When I almost jumped in the river to swim across, I heard the voice say, 'Adrian, no, that's not water!'. 

I kept walking. Suddenly, I sawa boat. I approached and saw some weird-looking rocks near the boat. I got closer and the rocks were were people who were sitting and looking at somebody talking to them. I approached them. Some people looked at me and smiled. I got behind the person who was standing. I tried to ask him if I could use the boat. He started to talk to them again. I waited for a long time. Then I poked his shoulder and asked him, 'Excuse me Sir, can I use...' He turns around.  I blurted 'You Son....!, You really exist!' More happiness overcame me and I embraced Him. He smiled at me and asked me, 'What are you doing here?'The person was the source of The Voice! I asked something and the answer was, 'Is not your time. Your son is not born yet; there are many things to do. You have to go back.' I said 'Wait, no!' He answered, 'We'll see each other, don't worry. Go back'. 

I woke up in the recovery room. The nurses treated me well but, acted strange when they were near me.
