  While I was still   married to my ex-husband I longed for a relationship where I was loved,   respected and treated kindly. I hoped to have this with my ex-husband but as it   was nearing ten years I had finally come to the realization that I was never   going to have it with him. Just at this time I had a dream that I was in a   swimming pool surrounded by patio lights. I was being held by an attractive man   with jet black hair and I felt wonderful feelings of love for this man. It was   so vivid that when I woke up I was excited. I enjoyed the feelings of that dream   all day. I had never know anyone with pure black hair before so I just enjoyed   the feelings and went about my daily business. &nbsp;

  I knew the   marriage was doomed and I was coming to terms the idea that I would be leaving.   About this time I was at my sister's house in another town. She had a pool in   her back yard with patio lanterns across the deck. Lots of people have those.   This day there was a knock at her door and she said, &quot;Oh, that's Ashley, our   neighborhood computer programmer. He's good looking.&quot; As she went down the   stairs to answer the door I peeked over into the stairwell to get a look at this   guy. Hmmm, not bad. I didn't think anymore about it. &nbsp;

  A few weeks later   I split up with my husband for good. Eventually, I began dating Ashley, the   computer programmer. Then that summer there I was in my sisters pool with patio   lanterns all around and in the arms of a man with jet black hair and we were in   love.&nbsp; It was Ashley!     </body>
