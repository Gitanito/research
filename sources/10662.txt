This person was in a large barn structure covering about a 100 yard area.  The whole view black and grey.  There were a couple hundred figures walking around taking tiny steps with their heads looking down. I was seen about 10 yards in the foreground, but I was seen in color. I was wearing a red shirt and had a yellow beam of light from the top of my head going upwards. The figures were grey and all looked the same. I could not tell if they were men or women. The floor in the structure was firm dirt.  I asked where I was, but was ignored like I wasn't there.

I was shocked 14 times then recovered.
