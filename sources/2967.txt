T h e S ir O liv e r L o d g e F in g e r Im pressions
By Brackett K. Thorogood
The finger impressions with which this
article deals are three-dimensional prints
which were produced in wax (Kerr) at
seances held in Boston, on July 13th,
14th and 15th, 1931, and which at the
time were said by "Walter" (Margery’s
control) to be those of Sit Oliver Lodge.
Finger print experts have since certified
that they are, indeed, identical in char­
acteristics with ordinary ink prints of
Sir Oliver’s thumbs.
The data presented here were collected
by the writer from his personal observa­
tion and from notes and stenographic
records of the meetings. That this record
may be as complete as possible all data,
photographs, and reports of the finger
print experts, as well as the reports of
the writer pertaining to the events of the
above dates are included.
In addition, photographs and brief
statements covering similar finger im­
pressions, made after the above dates,
are included here solely because they
have the same characteristics as the
others, viz: those of Sir Oliver Lodge’s
thumbs, although they have no bearing
on any of the above mentioned reports
or data previously made.
As far back as June 12, 1931, "Wal­
ter” began to make references to July
13th, which was to be a "big night”. He
made several intimations as to what
might occur, varying somewhat each time,
but, on July 10th he gave definite in­
structions with regard to preparations
for the "big night” promised July 13th
when, he said, he was going to carry
some of the experiments which the
writer had listed on a memorandum, and
that one he purposed to execute was the
making in wax (Kerr) of the finger
print of someone still living, without the
latter’s presence or knowledge. Later he
named Sir Oliver as the person. No one
knew of this plan except the writer
and his associate R. G. Adams, who
were alone at the time with the two
psychics, (Margery and Sary) who were
in trance, all other persons having pre­
viously been ordered by "Walter” to
leave the room; and at "Walter's” re­
quest the writer and Mr. Adams agreed
to say nothing about the plan.
Details of this meetingmaybefoundin
the report made by the writer on "Salient
Points Prior to July 13, 1931” (Exhibit
1, Part a). It should be noted that up
to this time the finger impressions which
"Walter” had produced were supposedto
be those of persons not living, but he has
since told us that one print of the three
made on a piece of wax and sealed in a
glass beaker on November 5, 1929, is
that of a woman who is living. (An
article on these prints will appear in a
later number of this Journal.)
Following this meeting of July 10,
1931, a seance was held on Monday,
July 13, 1931, (Exhibit 2) at which
three different right thumb impressions,
(Figs. 1 and 2) said by "Walter” to be
those of Sir Oliver Lodge, were obtained,
each on a separate piece of wax, the
last one being made with only the writer
and Margery in the locked seance room
and with both her hands securely held
by him. ■

SIR OLIVER LODGE FINGER IMPRESSIONS
The folloWlhgnight, Tuesday, (Exhibit
3 ) three more pieces of wax (Figs. 3
and 4) were impressed, each with two
prints which "Walter” stated were of
the right and left thumbs of Sir Oliver
Lodge.
On Wednesday afternoon (Exhibit 4)
another right thumb impression (Fig. 5)
similar to those previously secured was
obtained, with Mr. Daniel D. Walton
controlling Margery, and Mr. William
H. Button controlling Sary in another
part of the seance room, and with no
one else present. (No one except these
four knew of this seance until after the
evening seance was over.)
On the evening of this same day, at
another seance, (Exhibit 5) five pieces
of wax (Fig. 6) were impressed, each
with from one to four prints, some not
clear enough to identify and others suf­
ficiently distinct to show their similarity
to the impressions obtained on Monday
and Tuesday. Also at this seance an im­
pression was obtained on one of these
waxes (Fig. 7) which looks very much
like the under side of a wrist, as if it had
lain aganst the wax while the finger im­
pressions were being made.
All the wax impressions made during
these last four seances were immediately
taken away by the writer, photographed,
and enlargements made for better study.
They were then examined by Capt. Fife,
finger print expert, and as may be seen
from his report (Exhibit 6) he says they
are probably right and left thumb im­
pressions and that they are not the thumb
or finger impressions of any person pre­
sent at these sittings. All the rights have
a whorl with the same characteristics,
and the lefts a loop. (Incidentally, "Wal­
ter” had told the writer during the first
seance while making the last impression
that Sir Oliver Lodge’s right thumb
showed a whorl.)
Reference to Sir Oliver Lodge and to
Inspector Bell of Scotland Yard
By July 30th the writer had prepared
a brief report (Exhibit 1, Part c) on
the photographs of these twenty im­
pressions and had forwarded one copy to
the Society for Psychical Research, and
two to Dr. Crandon, one of which the
latter sent with a letter to Sir Oliver
Lodge in England. In this letter he
briefly stated what they were supposed
to represent and asked Sir Oliver to get
Mr. Bell, a finger print expert, to deter­
mine whether the characteristics were
identical with his (Sir Oliver’s) and to
make a report on his findings.
The report by the writer (Exhibit 1,
Part b) as of August 19th, on "The
Salient Points of the 13th, 14th and
15th”, covers a few items which were
nO
Omentioned in the signed records of
these meetings to which we have already
referred.
The report and photographs which
had been sent by Dr. Crandon to Sir
Oliver Lodge were not forwarded by
the latter to Mr. Bell until about Oct­
ober 10, 1931. In the meantime "Wal­
ter” on numerous occasions specifically
stated that these prints were of the
right and left thumbs of Sir Oliver
Lodge, and that he ("Walter”) would
either rise or fall on the decision.
After Mr. Bell had examined the
photographs he wrote Sir Oliver Lodge
asking for his thumb prints in order that
he might make the comparison. These
were made and sent to Mr. Bell by Sir
4
SIR OLIVER LODGE FINGER IMPRESSIONS
Oliver about October 21, 1931.
The following excerpt from the re­
port of the meeting of October 23, 1931,
is of interest here. "Walter" said: "Here
is a little advanced news. They have
decided It is Sir Oliver’s. They have
In spector Bell
After careful study Mr. Bell stated
clearly and very definitely in his report,
that the photographs of all the legible
impressions showed them to be of either
a right or left thumb and that they
were identical in characteristics with
those of Sir Oliver Lodge’s right and left
thumb ink impressions; and Mr. Bell
went further and prepared an exhibit
showing first the right thumb impression
in wax beside the actual right thumb
print of Sir Oliver Lodge, enlarged to
the same scale (Bell Exhibit A) (Fig.
8 ) and marked fourteen points of simi­
larity which he stated were sufficient to
satisfy him, although there were still
others; and in a similar manner he ar­
ranged the left thumb and its fourteen
points (Bell Exhibit B) (Fig. 9).
Mr. Bell's report (undated) was re­
ceived by Dr. Crandon on Nov. 25, 1931.
In it Mr. Bell, having learned, pre­
sumably from Sir Oliver Lodge, how
these impressions were supposed to have
originated, offers a possible solution in
the following statement:
"In view of the circumstances in which
many of these impressions were alleged
to have been obtained it is imperative for
me to state that even with a comparative-
Dr. Crandon’s
Upon receiving Mr. Bell's report, Dr.
Crandon decided to go to England to
confer with Sir Oliver and Mr. Bell.
After he had gone, a letter was re­
ceived from Mr. Bell, as of November
probably arrested Sir Oliver by now.”
Again, "The decision on the thumb
prints is in; Sir Oliver has it now."
And upon being asked if Sir Oliver
were pleased he replied, "Pleased as .
. . . ! Figure that out for yourself!’’ ;
"s First R eport
ly short association with a person it
would be quite a simple matter to ob­
tain thumb impressions and afterwards
to reproduce these identical replicas by
artificial means."
He also stipulated diat if any part of
his report should be published the parts
which he had underlined must be in­
cluded. (The complete report is given
here as Exhibit 7).
Prior to this time Mr. Bell had called
upon Sir Oliver to tell him about this
examination, and had reported to him
that the prints were identical.
Sir Oliver was very much surprised
that his fingerprints should have been
obtained in Boston; but Mr. Bell appar­
ently made it quite clear to him that it
would not have been at all difficult for
them to have been made artificially;-^
that it was quite a simple matter to de­
velop latent prints from a piece of paper
that he (Sir Oliver) might have
handled;—that such a print could easily
be photographed and then by a process
of which Bell apparently knows, that
this could be further reproduced in metal
or India rubber and an impress made on
wax. This was not an accusation, but
merely a statement of possibilities.
Visit to England
20th, (Exhibit 9) asking that a complete
set of the finger prints of both Dr. and
Mrs. Crandon (Margery) be sent him,
in order that he might see if there were
anv similarity between these, and those
5
SIR OLIVER LODGE FINGER IMPRESSIONS
alleeed to be Sir Oliver Lodges.
In view of Mr. Bell’s report it seemed
advisable to have Dr. Crandon ask Mr
Bell to produce or have produced
artificially in wax some two and three-
dimensional finger impressions from oft
ieinal ink prints and see if they could
be detected as replicas. His success
would of course substantiate his state­
ment and convictions, although it would
not mean that the thumb impres­
sions in question were thus reproduced
Consequently, while Dr. Crandon w
as
in England early in December he re­
quested Mr. Bell, both verbally and bv
letter, (Exhibit 10) to take his (Cran-
don’s) thumb prints and make such arti­
ficial reproductions as above mentioned
Further Correspondence With Mr. Bell
Shortly after his return Dr. Crandon
received a letter from Mr. Bell, dated
December 11th (Exhibit 11) ip which
the latter declined to comply with the
above request for reasons which he set
forth at length in an accompanying re­
port. (Exhibit 12)* He apparently based
this refusal on his study of an:article in
one of the Journals of Psychical Research
on the identity of the alleged supernor­
mal "Walter” print on a cast made sev­
eral years ago. The writer fails to see
any connection between any "Walter”
print whatsoever and dm prints which
Mr. Bell himself has agreed are identical
with those of Sir. Oliver Lodge. Neither
does he see the remotest connection be­
tween the "Walter” prints and an artifi­
cial reproduction of Dr. Crandon’sthumb­
print in three dimensions by Mr. Bell.
Since Mr. Bell in his own report states
that it would be relatively easy for such
a replica to be made, it would seem as
if he should be willing to add proof to
his already expressed conviction. Mr.
Bell s refusal to make the reproductions
surely reflects upon his ability to carry
out what he claims is a simple pro­
cedure, and the reasons he advanced for
this refusal are not sufficient to account
for it. The writer feels that he can
understand Mr. Bell’s unwillingness to
become further involved in a line of
investigation quite foreign to his own
line of work as a finger-print expert,
but could only wish that he might
have been induced to make or have made
the reproductions requested of him, for
as yet we have had no proof that replicas
can be made which would not be subject
to immediate detection under the scrutiny
of an expert.
In reply to Mr. Bell’s letter of Decem­
ber 11th, as well as the one of Novem­
ber 20th which had arrived during his
absence, Dr. Crandon on December 24th
(Exhibit 13) wrote to him answering the
points raised and calling his attention
to the fact that the only matter submitted
for his consideration in the first place
had been whether or not the photographs
of thumb impressions sent to him bore
the characteristic markings of those of
Sir Oliver Lodge.
Summary of Important Points
We have now given a brief synopsis
of all the documents and in conclusion
would like to call attention to the follow­
ing points.
1—That the writer had definitely asked
"Walter” to make an identifiable im­
pression in a plastic of die finger of
some living person.
6
SIR OLIVER LODGE FINGER IMPRESSIONS
2— That such impressions were obtained
and were said by "Walter" to be
those of Sir Oliver Lodge.
3— That the impressions in these waxes
have been declared by Mr. Bell, fin­
ger print expert, as identical with
the two-dimensional ink prints of Sir
Oliver Lodge.
4— That the writer certifies that, with
one exception, these impressions were
made on pieces of wax which he him­
self controlled and which were not
out of his possession except while be­
ing impressed.
*5—That it is a fundamental fact, in the
science of finger print identification,
that no two people have exactly the
same finger print patterns, although
it is true that some types of pattern
shew similarity in general appear­
ance; and that undoubtedly some
fingers show family relationships.
This is said to be especially true in
the case of identical twins.
6 —That if the foregoing statement be
true these impressions of the right
and left thumbs of Sir Oliver Lodge
could not have been produced by him
because he was not present at the
time; and no one who was present at
any of these seances has designs iden­
tical with his as shown by their two-
dimensional finger prints.*
7— That while it may be possible to
produce apparent replicas (as Mr.
Bell suggests) it seems unlikely that
they could escape detection by an ex­
pert when critically examined by
magnification or enlargement. This
would seemsufficient to eliminate any
serious consideration of the possibility
of these impressions having been arti­
ficially produced.
8— If, on the other hand, it should final­
ly be shown that replicas which defy
detection can be produced artificially,
it will then be necessary, in order to
prove scientifically and definitely that
these phenomena are supernormal, to
have them produced under still more
complete control, such, for instance,
as in a closed, sealed box containing
nothing but the marked, hot wax.f
9— To summarize, therefore, it appears
that the evidence presented by these
experiments (in which three-dimen­
sional finger impressions with a
definite pattern were produced in a
plastic medium), when viewed in
conjunctionwith theexperiencegained
from conducting many experiments,
with the precautions taken, and the
technical care observed, seems to sup­
port the contention that the phenome­
non of producing these impressions,
through or by the aid of the medium
"Margery" is supernormal.

Obviously <jiis assumption does not
of itself describe a method, or even
offer an hypothesis as to the mechanism
or mechanics of the procedure.
However, we believe that this pheno­
menon is in no way beyond explanation,
that, indeed, it must be governed by
very definite laws even though at pre­
sent they are unknown—or if known, un­
recognized—in this relationship.
Later Lodge Impressions
As indicated at the beginning of this
article several "Sir Oliver” tight thumb
impressions were obtained at seances
after July 15, 1931.
The first of these was a right thumb
obtained on November 23, 1931 (Fig.
1 0 ). It was a fair print but rather near
the edge of the wax and therefore only
the central portion shows. Later, on No­
vember 26,, 1931 four impressions were
made, one after the other, the first being
an unusually fine "Walter” print (Fig.
1 1 ); the second a typical Lodge right
thumb not particularly clear in the photo­
graph although covering more area than
the one of the 23d (Fig. 12). At this
point Capt. Fife, who was present, (the
writer was not) asked for an irregular or
imperfect print and the third, as may be
seen in Fig. 13 is another Lodge right
thumb but the wax is quite irregular, as
asked for by Capt. Fife. The fourth and
last of this series is rather poor but still
is a Lodge right thumb. (Fig. 14).
The detailed report of these experi­
ments of July 13, 14, and 15, 1931 states
that the waxes were all. carefully marked
for identification in different ways.
All these photographs are direct prints
or enlargements finished without re­
touching from negatives made by the
writer.. The exhibits mentioned in the
text follow.

A fter further conversation, not directly connected, "Walter" ordered everyone
out o f the room and downstairs except Margery, Sary, R. G. Adams and B. K.
T horogood. Margery and Sary were both in trance at this time and during conversa­
tion which follow ed, so far as the writer could determine.
W h en the above-mentioned four were alone, and the door closed and locked,
A dam s controlling Sary by holding her hands and Thorogood controlling Margery
in the same manner, all lights were out and room was dark except for a 5 x 7 inch
electric photographic dark-room lamp which had a W ratten filter which gave a soft,
low -intensity green light outside and to the side o f the cabinet.
"W alter” started by saying that on M onday, July 13th, he would make for us
Sir O liver Lodge’s thum b prints. H e w ished us to say absolutely nothing about it
to anyone, but to be prepared with wax, water, etc., on that date; and as a blind for
those w h o had been sent out o f the room, to have half a dozen other things prepared
in addition to the above and sim ply to say that almost anything m ight happen. "W al­
ter" said h e had not intended to get these prints now but he had to or might not get
another chance.
H e said that from now on all fooling and spectacular stunts w ould be eliminated;
that w e w ould work together and produce some real results from the physicists’ point
o f view .
H e then again warned us to say nothing; said that he was going; and told us to
be prepared on M onday. T he psychics shortly awoke and after w e were all dow n­
stairs Sary was asked to w rite automatically what "W alter” had told Adams and the
writer upstairs, and she w rote that there was nothing to say at this time. (I believe
D r. Crandon has this paper.)

O n M onday, July 13th, after the first tw o fingerprints had been made, and W al­
ter had sent everyone from the room except Margery, Adams, and the writer, he
stated to us that the prints w ere not very good; that he would make more on Tues­
day, and also make the left thum b at that time. A t this point I asked Adams to do
som ething for m e out o f the room, and w hile I was alone "W alter” discussed with
m e the m ethod o f approaching Sir Oliver Lodge. H e said I was to send a letter
and photographs to Sir O liver Lodge and put it right up to him to identify them.
IMPORTANT NOTE— H e then said, "Thorogood, I’ll tell you what I’ll do.
I w ill make the fingerprints o f six living scientists for you, and you shall pick your
ow n m en” ; and w hen I suggested som e be made in an enclosed space he said he
w ould do that

cupied in taking care o f and preparing the w ax both before and after the impressions

B rief D escription o f Photographs
T h e follow in g photographs, with the exception o f print N o. 1, Series III, are ol
im pressions made m dental wax (Kerr) during tests on July 13, 14 and 15, 1931,
betw een 7 .30 P.M . and 9:0 0 P.M . (E.S.T.), at 10 Lime Street, Boston, Massachusetts.
N o . 1, Series III, I understand was made on July 15th at 3:30 P.M . (E.S.T.J at the
sam e place.
T h e photographs are direct contact prints from the original photographic nega­
tives, made w ithout retouching, and include enlargements for better study. The size
of each im pression is indicated by the scale shown in each print.
Som e o f these photographs, because o f the m ethod o f lighting, may give an
im pression that the prints are raised rather than depressed, which is merely an illusion.
Each w ax is marked with the date and number in the order in which the impres­
sion s w ere m ade in each series.
Series I (Figs. 1 and 2)
T his series was made on July 13th and consists o f three single impressions whica
appear to be o f a thumb. (T he size o f the impressions indicates a thumb rather than
a fin ger).
T he sm all piece o f w ax 3b was cut from piece 3a for identification before 3a
was used. Fig. 2 is another view o f N o . 1 in Fig. 1.
Series II (Figs. 3 and 4 )
T his was made on July 14th and consists o f three double impressions— side by
side— apparently o f right and left thumbs, the right impression being o f the same de­
sign as those made on the 13th. There is no way o f telling whether they are of
the same person without having for comparison the finger prints which they are sup­
posed to represent.
F ig. 4, is another view o f N o . 3, Fig. 3.
Series III (F igs. 5, 6, and 7 )
T h is series was made on July 15th and consists o f single and m ultiple impres­
sions, som e partly crossed (i.e. as o f crossed fingers). Several o f these are o f the
sam e design as those made on July N th , but because som e o f the characteristics in the
design are lacking on account o f the small area o f contacts, it is not wholly dear whether
they are all thum b impressions or whether som e are o f fingers. H ere again this might
be determ ined if w e had for comparison a set o f the finger prints which they are sup­
posed to represent.
Fig. 6— N o . 2 wax— contains no design whatsoever, and N o. 3 contains only a
few lines
Fig. 7 also show s the impression o f what appears to be part o f a wrist, indicat­
in g quite clearly pores in the skin and impressions made by hairs, as w ell as a de­
pression w hich m ight be caused by bones o f the wrist.
T h e data pertaining to the characteristics o f the finger prints were furnished by
a finger print expert, Captain John W . Fife, o f Boston. H e states, after comparison
w ith their recorded finger prints, that these are not the prints o f anyone present on
the dates m entioned.
T h e photographs were made by the writer w ho, in the capacity o f spedal in ­
vestigator for the American Society o f Psychical Research, was present w ith his as­
sociate, M r. Ralph G. Adams, at all the tests except on the afternoon o f July 15ch.

directed that she be brought up and seated in th e far corner. H e said that she was
young and w ould see som ething she had never seen b efore. Sherburne brought her
up and seated her as directed. W alter then gave a dissertation sub stan tially as follow s:
"There are to be n o m ore repetitions o f th e o ld p hysical exp erim en ts. They
are all done. W e are n ow to proceed to sh ow you that th ere is n o d eath ; that each
o f you is livin g one life now and hereafter, each m ad e up o f step s. T h is life may
assume another form w hich w e call ‘after-death’. T h ese exp erim en ts w ill disrupt
many ideas, and particularly th e theories o f th e S. P . R . T h o se in th e S. P. R. o p ­

such theories. I am going to make a print of Sir Oliver Lodge’s right thumb. A fter

A fter th e first prints w ere taken as b elow W alter w as asked m any q uestions as
to what h e actually brought from E ngland. H e w o u ld on ly reply, "I h ave brought
this thum bprint.” A lso, "It has a bearing on all apports. It has a trem endous bear­

A t 9 :3 0 W alter called for hot w ater w h ich w as p ut o n tab le and T h orogood ,

third print which was immediately returned to Button as soon as sitting was over.
Button identified his marks and observed a good thumbprint on it.
T horogood identified the markings he had put on the first tw o pieces.
W alter remarked several times that this was Thorogood’s experiment and would
m ake him either notorious or famous "both of which are the same.”
Sitting closed at 10:20 P.M . and downstairs it was found that there had been
produced three prints o f a right thumb alleged to be that of Sir Oliver Lodge. Dur­
in g the seance W alter had said the prints were unusual and each had a central
circular core, which proved to be the case. D uring the sitting W alter announced sev­
eral tim es that he was goin g away and each time silence would ensue for tw o or three

W alter ordered the Victrola stopped. It was done. Thorogood stopped fan.
W alter ordered it on.
W alter’s voice was very strong. Said he w ould doubly amaze us tonight. W ould
do som ething never done before. W ould complicate all our wires with Sir O liver’s fin­
gers and toes. A lso that the arguments and discussions caused by last night’s pheno­
m ena w ere good for us, w e were too complaisant, that he would puzzle us more to­
night. H e then ordered Button and Mrs. Richardson to change places; then Sary and
Carl Litzelmann. W alter continued his comments to the effect that it was good to
know w e were worried, it would keep us going.
W alter then ordered us to form tw o circles. First, to left, Margery, Richardson,
M rs. Richardson, Button and Crandon; second, to left, Litzelmann, Sary, Adams, W al­
ton. (W alter ordered Adam s into this circle.)
T h e first circle surrounded the table, the screen being in place as on previous
evening. Later W alter said the object o f the tw o circles was to increase the power.
A fter arranging the circles W alter asked Thorogood if he had marked the wax.
T horogood said he had. W alter asked if the pieces were large. Thorogood said
’’not particularly.” W alter wanted large pieces and directed Thorogood to g o down­
stairs and get them and W alton and Button to accompany him to mark the wax.
T he three w ent to the back room and opened a new box o f wax containing eight
pieces. W alton and Button marked five. Thorogood took these and one not marked.
Button took the other tw o unmarked pieces and the three returned to the seance room

Exhibit 7
Report (Undated) By W . T . Bell
O n th e 10th O ctober 1931 I received from Sir O liver L od ge a series o f p h o to ­
graphs o f d igital im pressions for exam ination and report.
T h ese im pressions w ere alleged to have been m ade o n dental w ax at th e h om e
o f D r. L. R. G . C randon, M .D ., 10 Lim e Street, B oston, M ass., U . S. A ., on the
13th , N th and 15th July, 1 9 3 1 . .
I h ave carefully scrutinized the photograph s referred to and am in a p osition
to say that all the legib le prints are thum b im pressions, or manufactured replicas of
thumb impressions.
In m aking this report I feel that it is necessary to stipulate that if publication
is m ade in w hich m y nam e is used, it m ust be pub lished verbatim , or, if any e x ­
tract is published regarding any particular p hotograph, th en th e sentences and para­
graphs underlined by m e in this report m ust also at the sam e tim e be quoted.
In view of the circumstances in which many of these impressions were alleged
to have been obtained it is imperative for me to state that even with a compara­
tively short association with a person it would be quite a simple matter to obtain
thumb impressions and afterwards to reproduce these identical replicas by artificial
means.*
I. T h e im prints show n in Series I are all o f th e w horl type, are identical w ith
each other and represent a right thum b im pression.
II. In Series II th e im pressions on th e right o f each pair o f prints are identical
w ith th ose in Series I.
T h e incom plete print on w ax N o . 2 d iscloses little characteristic data, but it
is probable that this print is also id entical w ith th ose o f Series I. A d efinite op in ion
cannot be given regarding this partial im print. T h e im prints o n th e le ft o f each
pair are o f the loop type and prove to be im pressions o f a left thum b.
III. In Series III th e im pressions on w ax m arked N o . 2, N o . 3, N o . 4 , and N o . 5
are lacking in characteristic data and th erefore useless for p urposes o f fixin g identity.
T h e im pressions on w ax m arked N o . 1 and N o . 6 are repeat im prints o f the
thum b prints recorded in Series I and II. T h e large im pression show n on w ax N o .
6, print G , certainly appears to be a skin m ark and m ay conceivably b e that o f a
wrist sh ow in g a depression on the w ax th e w rist b on e w ou ld m ake.
I am not in a position to m ake any further observation as to this m ark as the
question o f identity cannot arise.
W ith regard to th e id entity o f th ese prints th is is n ot affected in any w ay by
the appearance in som e cases o f ridges as furrow s.
Such reversal o f ridges and furrow s can b e satisfactorily accounted for by the
m anner o f ligh tin g th e object w h ilst b ein g photographed.
In such cases as these th e lig h tin g p roblem is o ft tim es difficult.
A n exam ple o f reversal o f ridges and furrow s is to be seen in the loop print,
N o . 6, dated 7-15-31.
O n the 21st O ctober, 1931, I received from Sir O liver L od ge norm al im prints
o f his thum b taken w ith ink in th e ordinary w ay.
I have prepared an exh ib it sh o w in g an en largem en t o f a norm al im pression of
the right thum b o f Sir O liver L odge, togeth er w ith an en largem en t o f im print on w ax
marked N o . 2, dated 7-1 3 -3 1 , Series 1, m ade at B oston, M ass. See E xhibit " A ” . (F ig .
8, infra).
In this case I have marked on each p hotograph 14 sk in ridge characteristics w hich
are to be found in agreem ent.
T h e characteristics indicated d o n ot exhaust th e sup p ly o f data available for com ­
parison but is sufficient to convince m e that these im pressions are id entical w ith each
other.

th a t th e s e im p re ssio n s are a lso id en tical.
Regarding the exhibits it will be seen that the subsidiary ridges (these are per­
haps best described as an attempt of additional ridges to develop between the main
ridges) are more pronounced in the prints produced at Boston.

Another noticeable point is the absence of pore marks in the ridge lines of the
impressions obtained in Boston. These are reproduced in the normal impressions of
Sir Oliver Lodge.
My experience has been that imprints in wax reproduce these minute pore marks
with extraordinary clearness. It should be stated, however, that the appearance of
pore marks normally produced, depends to a certain extent upon the temperature of
the digit at the time the imprint is made.

CHIEF INSPECTOR W . T. BELL
L e t t e r s a n d R e p o r t
W embley, M iddlesex.
20th November, 1931.
Dear Doctor Crandon,
Sir Oliver Lodge has, I believe, written you regarding the extraordinary du­
plicates of his thumb impressions which were obtained in Boston during a recent
series of sittings.
As an expert I was compelled to vouch for their identity, but for my own
satisfaction I should be personally indebted if you would be kind enough to let me
have a complete set of the thumb and finger prints of both hands of your wife "M ar­
gery" and also both hands of yourself, in order that I may see whether there are,
by any chance, any points of similarity between these and the "Lodge" im prints which
were obtained.
Yours sincerely,
(S ig n e d ) W . T . B e l l .

(Quoted in Air. Bell’s Report [Exhibit 11])

b u t th a t th e th u m b , like the rest o f h e hand, is distorted. T h e ball o f th e th u m b

o f th e d isto rtio n , th e p attern is in general identical w ith th a t o f th e w ax p rin ts in

th e re la tio n s h ip o f num erous bifurcations is consistent w ith those o f th e w ax prin ts.
In sp ite o f th e peculiar distortion o f this th u m b I am convinced th at it is th e sam e
fin g e r p rin t p a tte rn as th e o ther prints and that it proves th a t th e convex p rin ts above

a cteristics a re concerned, they are n o t the sam e identical p rin ts. T h e resm blance is
sufficiently close to show blood relationship.
"In comparing both M
argery’s and Walter’s prints with those of their mother,
Airs. Stinson, l found that the patterns and characteristics contained in the prints
of all three resem
ble each other closely enough to indicate blood relationship. In)
families there is usually noted a correspondence of special characteristics amounting,
in the case of a mother and son, to as much a
s seventy-five percent, and betw
een
brother and sister to fifty percent.

WALTER HELPS T O PER FECT TH E CONTROL
B y W i l l i a m H . B u t t o n
Attached hereto is the report of a sitting
at 10 Lim e Street on February 16th,
1932, and several other reports which teli
their own story. A few comments, how­
ever, On the phenomena and their im­
plications may be in order.
In the February number o f the Journal
there appeared an article by Dr. Richard­
son in regard to the production of the
post-mortem thumbprints o f the late
Judge H ill. In it the conditions of control
under which such prints were produced
were described in detail. In the present
issue M r. Thorogood, Research Consult­
ant o f this SocietySJdescribes in detail
several sittings at which there were
likewise produced the thumbprints o f Sir
Oliver Lodge, who at the time was in
England. M r. Thorogood’s article also
describes minutely the conditions under
which those prints were obtained.
The implications from these pheno­
mena are as important as from anything
that has ever been published in regard
to psychical research.
It w ill be observed that the control
that existed on these occasions was very
strict but the phenomena are so remark­
able that they emphasize the fact that
too much cannot be done to perfect the
control.
The Lodge article shows the reaction o f
Mr. Bell, the ex-Scotland Yard fingerprint
expert, and it is characteristic. Bell knew
that some years ago the Crandons had
spent a day or so with Sir O liver Lodee at
his home in England. He undoubtedly
new of Crandon’s correspondence with
Sir Oliver. Therefore Bell was not to be
caught. H e immediately advanced the
theory that any person who had as­
sociated w ith Sir O liver for even a short
time could easily get his fingerprints
(two dim ensional) and manufacture
therefrom a die from which three dimen­
sional impressions could be made. When
called upon to demonstrate this proposi­
tion, however, M r. B ell drew a red herr­
ing across the trail. It is extremely doubt­
fu l that such reproductions could be
made and not be immediately recognized
as such.
The circumstances attending the H ill
and Lodge print sittings were such that
no die ;.cpuld have been used and none
was used. Nevertheless, it is desirable
that any additional control that ingenuity
can devise should be applied to the pro­
duction o f such phenomena.
For a long time various researchers in
this field have been impressed with the
desirability o f producing phenomena un­
der circumstances that do not depend up­
on personal control. Sir W illiam Crookes
realized the desirability o f this. M r. Dud­
ley was impressed w ith it. From the be­
ginning o f his association with the sub­
ject M r. Thorogood has fe lt strongly thaf
such control was the most important
thing to be developed, and has exercised
much ingenuity in perfecting such control
w ith a success that w ill be apparent from
the situation herein described. It is evi­
dent herefrom that W alter him self is mb
ly aware o f the importance of these
ideas.
O n February 16th, 1932, the writer
was in Boston to attend a sitting at Lime

136 WALTliR HELPS TO PERFECT THE CONTROL
Street that evening. He unexpectedly re­
ceived a telephone message from Mrs.
Litzelm ann from her home in Cambridge
stating that by automatic writing she had
received a message from W alter for the
w riter which ran thus:
" W a lte r h a s a m essage h e w ould like
g iv e n to M r. B u tto n .
"1 w a n t you to ask T ho ro g o o d if he
w ill ta k e h is lock off th e box and let you
p u t o n e o f yo u r o w n o n it just fo r ex ­
p e rim e n t to n ig h t. T h is is confidential,
te ll h im .”
M rs. Litzelm ann has kindly furnished
the original writing, a portion of which
is reproduced in the accompanying illus­
tration, figure 1.
M rs. Litzelm ann herself is a remark­
able medium. She was an important fac­
tor in the cross-correspondence that took
place in connection with Margery and
Hardwicke. Her writing comes with
rapidity and is o f the mirror type, that
is, to be read it must be held against a
ligh t and read from the back or from its
reflection in a mirror. She produces this
w riting spontaneously, very rapidly and
regardless o f all distractions.
It is startling enough to have received
an intelligent message purporting to come
from another plane when the event proves
that message to have an important bear­
ing on subsequent experiments.
The w riter carried out the instructions
thus given by W alter, called up Thoro­
good, explained the situation to him and
Thorogood agreed to take his lock off the
box in the seance room at Lime Street.
The w riter went to a hardware store and
bought a heavy Yale lock with two keys.
Th is lock and the keys thereto he kept
in his own pocket continuously until fif­
teen minutes before the sitting when he
procured the key to the seance room,
which is always locked. He went to that
room, found that Thorogood had re­
moved his lock from the box and had
removed a ll the articles he had in it
with the exception of a small wooden
duck. The writer thereupon placed in the
box a small china coffee cup and a piece
of Kerr with two notches on it, his idea
being to provide something that W alter
could break if so inclined. He also put
in the box a calendar sheet, the number
on which nobody in the world knew, as
detailed in the report herewith.
He also placed in the box a mass of
plasticine for the purpose o f receiving a
fingerprint impression. H e locked the
box with the padlock he had procured and
kept the keys in his pocket until the box
was opened. He also searched the seance
room and kept the key in his possession
until the beginning o f the sitting. He then
checked the sitters as they entered and
locked the door behind them. W alter
after a short time gave a correct descrip­
tion o f the coffee cup, duck and the piece
of Kerr in the box, correctly read the
calendar number and made a distinct
W alter thumbprint in the m iddle o f the
mass o f plasticine, all as discovered upon
the opening o f the box in the light o f a
red electric torch as described in the re­
port.
Captain Fife’s report herewith shows
that the print obtained is one o f the w ell
known W alter thumbprints. (Fig. 2).
The illustration (Fig. 3) shows the other
articles contained in the box.
The box itself is no flim sy affair.
There are illustrations herewith o f the
box both open and locked. (Fig. 4) M r.
Thorogood’s description is as follow s:

Here then is much food for reflection.
Follow ing the directions given early in
the afternoon through Mrs. Litzelmann
and purporting to come from himself,
W alter succeeds in an enclosed space, in ­
accessible to everyone except the writer, in
cognizing three articles, reading a num­
ber known to nobody and leaving his
thumbprint.
These phenomena involve a great
variety o f the classes o f phenomena
fam iliar to psychical research. In a re­
markable degree the production of the
fingerprint under these circumstances of
automatic control supplements the force
o f the evidence connected with the H ill
and Lodge prints and all other prints ob­
tained.
That the importance and value o f this
contribution to the subject is fu lly recog­
nized by W alter is evident from the direc­
tions given by him. He realized that the
box had been in the seance room for some
time and that it might be claimed that
duplicate keys existed. He therefore in­
sisted on a new lock. He insisted that
the locking of the box be verified by all
the sitters before and again after the phe­
nomena occurred. The writer has had oc­
casion before to point out that W alter
him self is one o f the best investigators.
In this connection it may be of interest
to consider W alter’s statements about the
box and his relationship to it. During
the sitting o f February 12th, 1932, W al­
ter asked, referring to the box involved
herein, "W hat do you think they are
going to say if I should work in this
boxP’g *
Thorogood: ” 1 think they are going to
believe it.”
W alter: "W e ll, strange to say, I think
they are.”
Later in the same sitting the follow ing
conversation occurred.
Thorogood: "A re you going to try your
. own thum bprint first?”
W alter: "Certainly. D id you put plasti­
cine in the box?”
Thorogood: "Y e s” .
W alter: "M onday night put a s m a ll piece
on the table” .
Thorogood: "I can put it in now” .
W alter: "N o , I am h a lf in the box and
h alf out. D o not put it in too soft or
it w ill spoil the impression.”
Later W alter said "In the next eight or
ten sittings, prepare your box and have
your cameras set, not a lot o f light, do
not fuss w ith the box, just open the door,
42
WALTER HELPS TO PERFECT THE CONTROL
put the stuff in and leave it alone". W al­
ter also requested Thorogood to put the
box behind the cabinet when he was tak­
ing a flashlight picture.
A t a sitting on February 14th, 1952,
W alter said that he must not be hur­
ried, that the program was stupendous
but would be constantly progressive. He
said too that he was going to read the
cards, break the telephone receivers and
make a fingerprint in plasticine, all inside
of the locked, sound-proof box. He then
added "That w ill be the last of that box.
Then I w ill do the big box that Thoro­
good is making and that w ill end all
boxes.” H e made some complaint that me
black cloth had not been kept on the box
and said "That box is surrounded with en­
ergy like the ring around the moon or
like a six inch covering of gelatine all
over it. You w ill all have to be very
strict about no light and not crossing the
circle and keeping the black cloth on.
Every letter o f my instructions must be
carried out.”
A t a sitting on February 15th, 1932,
W alter said "Let me tell you some news.
I have succeeded in getting into the box
and thereby hangs a 'tail’. I have suc­
ceeded in getting in and out.”
The above quotations from the stance
records show Walter’s attitude toward
these phenomena and the control he ex­
ercises over them.
A study of the phenomena of February
16th, 1932, w ill make it clear that
in a closed, isolated space, phenomena
of materialization and telekinesis oc­
curred as evidenced by the thumbprint.
Intelligent cognitions occurred as evi­
denced by the naming of the duck, the
coffee cup and the Kerr with the marks
thereon. The telepathists may get some
comfort for their theory in this regard
but no one knew of these articles except
the writer. Next there was the cognition
of the calendar number, known to no­
body in the world. Therein was clair­
voyance or some similar phenomenon.
Next there was some active intelligence
producing and regulating all of these
phenomena. The animists and spiritists
can argue that out at their leisure.
There are few sittings that have been
published which combine so many varie­
ties of phenomena; and none, so fat as
we know, that occurred under such re­
markable conditions of control.

in th e b ox except a sm all wooden duck. M r. B utton thereupon placed in the box
a sm all coffee cup, a piece of K err w ith tw o notches on it and a calendar num ber,
i'h e calen d ar num ber was selected as follow s: M r. button, before going to the seance
room , tu rn e d a day by day calendar on its back and tore out ten leaves at random .
H e d ated an d num bered them in sequence 1 to 10 on the back and did not at any
tim e see any num ber am ong the ten. H e put these in an envelope which he put in his
p o ck et. In th e seance room on the above occasion he turned out the flashlight, took
th e en v elo p e out o f his pocket, selected one of the num bers at random and put it in
th e b o x w ith o u t know ing w hat it was. M r. Button had earlier prepared a mass ot
p lasticin e o n a sm all piece of tin. H e had m odeled it into an oval mass w ith the
c en ter q u ite h ig h , som ething like half an egg. H e then sm oothed the surface off with
th e b la d e o f h is knife, exam ined the plasticine through a m agnifying glass to see that
th e re w ere n o m arks or thum bprints on it. T his M r. B utton lastly put into the box.
H e th e n locked the box, put the tw o keys in his pocket and replaced the cloth over
th e box. M r. B utton retained the key to the seance room until 9 p.m . w hen he un­
locked th e do o r and checked the sitters as they entered and then locked the door.
N o n e o f th e sitters knew any of these facts.
A fte r th e above happenings som ething was heard to drop on the floor. W alter
said it w as th e m edium ’s cough drop. T his referred to the fact that at the beginning
o f th e sittin g , both M argery and M rs. Baker said that they w ere chew ing cough drops.
A co ugh d ro p w as retrieved from the floor after the sitting. C randon asked W alter
if h e w as looking over B utton’s shoulder w hile B utton was putting things in the
box. W a lte r said it w ould m ake no difference w hether he was or not. It would
n o t account fo r the thum bprint. W hen asked if he knew w hat was in the box,
B u tto n said h e d id. W alter immediately corrected him and said that B utton did not
k n o w w h a t th e num ber was. This B utton adm itted. Before the box was opened
B u tto n asked W alter if he w ould break the Kerr. W alter said "D o you w ant to
p a in t th e lily? 1 have done enough for one night.”
S ittin g en d ed at 10 p.m .
In th e book room D r. Richardson exam ined the thum bprint on the plasticine.
It w as a com paratively distinct print o f some depth in the m iddle o f the mass of
plasticin e. D r. R ichardson thought it was one o f the W alter prints. It was given to
M r. B u tto n w ho kept it in his possession until the next day w hen he sent for Captain
F ife w h o said he thought it was a W alter print but w ould exam ine it further. M r.
B u tto n th e n delivered it to M r. Thorogood for photographing w ith the request that
h e d e liv e r it to C aptain Fife.
A copy o f th e w riting received automatically by M rs. Litzelm ann is attached.
