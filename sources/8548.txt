  How  could a clear consciousness outside one's body be experienced at the moment that  brain no longer functions during a period of clinical death with flat EEG?&nbsp;  THE LANCET * Vol 358 *    December 15, 2001     COMMENTARY p. 2010 
  
   Are  NDEs caused by misfiring neurons in a dying brain?

&nbsp;  Presuming   there is a separation of conscious from the physical body during an NDE, how is   it possible then that the mind (physiologically the brain)   remembers what occurred during the NDE, when it remained in the physical body   all the time?   

There have many relatively     recent studies on consciousness. The current theory is that consciousness is     where the memories are stored, not the brain. Many scientists have postulated     that as an information storage unit the brain cannot possibly hold all the     information. Therefore, the brain is more of an accessing unit much like a     radio receiver. Additional findings have shown that the way we remember is not     as a computer disk drive, but rather we store a core memory attached to an     emotion and then file it in an concept area in the brain. When we retrieve our     memories, we are programmed to &quot;fill in the gaps.&quot; Therefore brain memories     rarely are 100% totally accurate. However, that being said, the NDEs report     100% life reviews of every thought, deed, and how we made others feel. This is     the computer hard drive - the consciousness that survives death. My guess is that it     is such an intense experience that it may create in the brain what is known as     a &quot;flashbulb moment.&quot; These are times that the brain takes a picture of a     particular instance, usually occurring in times of heightened sensory and     emotional input or life-threatening moments. These memories are ingrained in     the brain and the person can recall like it happened yesterday.


  
  Are  NDEs caused by false memories?    It has been suggested  that NDEs are not memories of events that actually happened, but rather are  &quot;false memories,&quot; products of the imagination.&nbsp;   This idea comes in part from recent psychological studies suggesting that  it is possible to implant false memories into research subjects so that they  truly believe imaginary events actually occurred to them.&nbsp;   However, those psychological studies that implant false memories take  considerable effort to suggest to the subject that the experience really did  happen, using repetition and encouragement of suggestible children to recall  experiences suggested by the authoritative experimenter.&nbsp;   If that model were used to explain NDE, who is it that is making those  efforts to implant the false memories in NDErs, repeatedly suggesting to them  that they had an NDE?

Although    I do not think implanted &quot;false memories&quot; are a plausible    explanation for NDEs, there are real questions about how to interpret NDE    accounts, especially from people who do not recall their NDEs immediately, but    seem to remember their NDEs only after some time has passed.&nbsp;     For example, in my research with patients hospitalized for attempted    suicide, I identified for monthly follow-up interviews those who described    NDEs as a result of the suicide attempt and a matched control group who denied    having had NDEs.&nbsp;  There were a few    &quot;control&quot; patients who, on follow-up visits, later described NDEs in    the course of their initial suicide attempt.&nbsp;     They all told me that they simply didn't trust me sufficiently in our    initial interview to share the NDE.&nbsp;

This    should not be surprising, because many of them were concerned about being    regarded as crazy - particularly when they were being interviewed by a    psychiatrist shortly after a suicide attempt, when they were trying to gain    release from the hospital!&nbsp;  For    example, one patient who initially denied any memories of being unconscious    later told me about watching her unconscious body being resuscitated after her    overdose. A month later, she said that, now that she knew I wouldn't misuse    the information, she could trust me with what REALLY happened, and she told me    about kundalini-like sensations as she flowed out of the crown of her head to    leave her body.&nbsp;  A month after    that, she told me that NOW she trusted me enough to tell me about her meeting    with her deceased father.&nbsp;  The    next month it was her encounter with Jesus.&nbsp;     And so it went, with new revelations in each interview.&nbsp;     I suspect there were some parts of her NDE that were so personal that I    never would have heard about them if the study had lasted a lifetime.

The    question becomes: How are we do differentiate (a) patients genuinely    increasing their trust in us and opening up more and more from (b) patients    making up stories after the fact (consciously or unconsciously) and    retroactively attributing them to the time of the initial event?&nbsp;     There is no easy answer to this question.&nbsp;     There are some preliminary studies suggesting that functional MRI    imaging of the brain may be able to differentiate &quot;true&quot; from    &quot;false&quot; memories, but short of subjecting NDErs to fMRIs, we don't    have a technology for distinguishing memories of real events from imagination.&nbsp;     However, unless we have some reason to suspect that an NDEr is highly    suggestible AND has had some strong motivation to imagine having had an NDE,    there is no rational reason to assume that the NDE is a &quot;false    memory.&quot;

Another key part of the longitudinal  study by van Lommel and cited in the Lancet, was the effect of time, memory and  suppression of the NDE during the integration process.&nbsp;   The commentary in the Lancet talks of NDEs being the result of false  memories.&nbsp;  Interestingly, if this  were true, then this rationale could not explain why the study found that people  could recall their NDE exactly over the span of a 2-year and an 8-year period.&nbsp;       Id.     at 2041.&nbsp;  Moreover, the skeptic  commentary quoted memory studies of children, but lacked information on adults.&nbsp;   The cardiac arrest population consisted of adults rather than children.&nbsp;   There was a profound lack of explanation as to what constitutes false  memory, and many in the field of psychology agree that false memory is credited  with filling in small gaps in memory rather than inventing whole stories.&nbsp; Near  Death Experience In Survivors of Cardiac Arrest: A Prospective Study in the  Netherlands,  Pim  van Lommel, et al,  THE  LANCET ' Vol 358 '    December 15, 2001 .

Why  do some people believe that NDEs are not real?  

Although there are many answers to    this multifaceted question, part of the controversy stems from the way science    proves observed phenomena.&nbsp; &quot;Science&quot; is defined as the process    used to find truth.&nbsp; Best    Evidence, Schmicker, Michael, pg 37.&nbsp; &quot;In contrast, 'Scientism'    is a philosophy of materialism, masquerading as scientific truth.&nbsp;    Paranormal research, has used the process of science to prove the existence of    a variety of phenomena, that simply doesn't fit within Scientism's philosophy    of materialism.&nbsp; If evidence conflicts with philosophy, the evidence    should not be dismissed; instead, the philosophy should be    revised.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;&nbsp;    What  are some observations regarding skeptic arguments?&nbsp;&nbsp;  

&quot;Skeptics have done valuable and    respectable work in challenging paranormal claims.&quot;&nbsp; Best    Evidence, Schmicker, Michael, pg 40.&nbsp; Healthy skepticism helps to    find the truth.&nbsp; A true skeptic is someone who &quot;express[es]    uncertainty or doubt, non belief rather than disbelief.&nbsp; In contrast, too    many skeptics and debunkers are disbelievers, offering answers rather than    questions.&quot; Id.&nbsp;    &nbsp;&quot;Skeptics    point to the possibility of errors in observation,&quot; but there are many    documented cases involving &quot;multiple, independent witnesses whose    testimony agrees.&quot; Id. at 36.

&quot;Skeptics warn that some people    who report paranormal events may be biased towards belief in their    reality.&quot;&nbsp; The counterargument is that &quot;many skeptics bring an    equally unscientific bias towards disbelief to their investigations - a    prejudice so strong that they won't accept a phenomenon even if they    personally witness or experience it.&quot; Id.

Skeptics argue that people who    report paranormal events are only looking for attention.&nbsp; The counter    argument is &quot;most eyewitnesses of a strange, paranormal event have little    to gain and much to lose by reporting them.&nbsp; They're usually branded as    wackos and nut cases.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's    just not socially acceptable to profess a belief in a non-material world    beyond the five senses.&nbsp; As a result, under-reporting of these phenomena    is more likely than over-reporting.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;

Are    NDEs caused by Hallucinations?    NDEs    are not HALLUCINATIONS: &nbsp;     Outside of the control group of 121,      Mel    Morse interviewed 37 children that had been treated    with mind-altering medication (anesthetic agents, narcotics, Valium, Thorazine,    Holdol, Dilantin, antidepressants, mood elevators, and painkillers.&nbsp;     None of the children experienced an NDE or anything close to an NDE.&nbsp;     One child specifically due to the nature of her medical condition, was    helped to hallucinate.&nbsp;  Nothing she    described resembled an NDE.&nbsp;  Further,    she told Morse that she was fully cognizant of being hypnotized.&nbsp;     Closer to the Light, Learning    from the Near-Death Experiences of Children, Melvin    Morse M.D., with Paul Perry, Ballantine Books 1991, pg 23-24. 
    
     Do     you think that hospice patients who see deceased relatives are merely     hallucinating on morphine?   My reply is that I have     observed people who are hallucinating on medications.&nbsp; During those     hallucinations they can not hold a logical conversation with me.&nbsp; They are     completely lost in their hallucinations.

    In contrast, I have     interrupted dying people who were conversing with deceased relatives that I     could not see.&nbsp; When interrupted, they could talk with me in a completely     rational fashion and make complete sense.&nbsp; When we completed our conversation,     they went back to talking with their deceased relatives, clearly preferring     their company to mine at that moment!&nbsp; Later they are often glad to tell me     about the conversations that they were having&nbsp; with their deceased relatives     when I interrupted them.

    &nbsp;In my mind there is a     profound difference in the recollections of a person who has been     hallucinating and one who has been conversing with deceased relatives.

Does     a reaction to &quot;ether&quot; chemically simulate a tunnel vision, so commonly seen in     NDEs? &nbsp;  Ether     notoriously can cause a spinning feeling which can be nauseating.&nbsp; This ether     experience can be perceived as a tunnel. Usually the ether 'tunnel' experience     is different from the tunnel experience of NDEs where there is no 'vertigo'     sensation.&nbsp; Another distinguishing feature is that the NDE tunnel experience     almost always is a highly lucid experience with full conscious alertness.&nbsp;     Ether 'tunnels' are just before you go to sleep, and would not be expected to     be lucid.&nbsp;

What     is the difference between the psychiatric problem of     seeing double and the out of body experience when the NDEr describes     seeing themselves?  The     psychiatric syndrome of autoscopy is the characteristic &quot;doppelganger&quot; of     literature.&nbsp; In classical autoscopy,&nbsp;the person's consciousness remains in his     or her physical body, and the person sees a &quot;double&quot; of him- or herself, which     usually imitates all the actions of the physical body.&nbsp; Most typically, the     autoscopic &quot;double&quot; is hazy, colorless, and transparent,&nbsp;and only includes the     face and shoulders, rather than the whole body.&nbsp; The &quot;double&quot; may move toward     or away from the physical body, and the person having the autoscopic vision is     usually quite sad.

    By contrast,     in the NDE, the person's consciousness is not in his or her physical body, but     is&nbsp;rather in&nbsp;the &quot;double.&quot;&nbsp; The person sees his or her own physical body from     the point of view of the &quot;double,&quot; and the physical body is usually     motionless, while the person moves about in the double.&nbsp; The vision of the     physical body appears as the whole body, and&nbsp;appears real and lifelike.&nbsp;     Sadness is quite rare in NDEs.

Are    there any medical or emotional explanations for NDE, such as lack of oxygen to    the brain or images produced from fear chemicals of a dying brain?  

The van Lommel study cited in    the Lancet, can be cited for major NDE scientific findings,  the largest being that NDEs are not  medically explicable.       pg. 2039.&nbsp;  Van Lommel proved  under rigid methodology that the occurrence of the NDE was not associated with  'duration of cardiac arrest or unconsciousness, medication, or fear of death  prior to the cardiac arrest.'&nbsp;        </font></b>Near  Death Experience In Survivors of Cardiac Arrest: A Prospective Study in the  Netherlands,  Pim    van Lommel, et al,  THE  LANCET ' Vol 358 '      December 15, 2001 .</p>

Given the similarity in physiological make-up of the sample  population, one would expect that most of the 344 patients should experience an  NDE. pg. 2039 &nbsp; This would take into account  the skeptic argument of cerebral anoxia (dying brain cells).&nbsp;   However, that is not the case.&nbsp;  The  findings were that 18% of the 344 cardiac arrest patients had an NDE, with 12%  of the 18% reporting a 'core experience.'     Id.     &nbsp; Therefore, NDE is not  correlated with physiological causes of death.&nbsp;   However, the study did find that age might play a factor in the  occurrence of NDEs in that younger experiencers were more likely to have an NDE  and more likely to have a core experience.&nbsp;        Id.     at 2043.&nbsp; </font></b>Near  Death Experience In Survivors of Cardiac Arrest: A Prospective Study in the  Netherlands,  Pim  van Lommel, et al,  THE  LANCET ' Vol 358 '    December 15, 2001 . </p>

The  same argument pertaining to physiological make-up could be made for those in the  sample population who were psychologically afraid of death right before the  cardiac arrest.&nbsp;  However, there was  no difference between those who were afraid and reported an NDE as opposed to  those who were afraid and did not report an NDE.&nbsp;       Id.     at 2039.&nbsp;  Therefore, NDE  doesn't appear to be caused by emotional make-up such as fear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near  Death Experience In Survivors of Cardiac Arrest: A Prospective Study in the  Netherlands,  Pim  van Lommel, et al,  THE  LANCET ' Vol 358 '    December 15, 2001 .
  
   ANOTHER  STUDY

The    children in Morse's study were also hypoxic, had acid-based balance    disturbances, and had high CO2 levels, and every combination you could    imagine.&nbsp;  Yet they had nothing like    an NDE. Closer to the Light,    Learning from the Near-Death Experiences of Children,    Melvin Morse M.D., with Paul Perry, Ballantine Books 1991 Pg 48           </blockquote>

Are  NDEs caused from sleep deprivation, bad dreams, or the subconscious awareness of  surgery?  

Morse    published 3 articles in the AMA's pediatric journal as a result of his    studies.&nbsp;  The scientists and    physicians who reviewed his protocol were very complimentary about research    design and scientific validity of the results.&nbsp;     Closer to the    Light, Learning from the Near-Death Experiences of Children,    Melvin Morse M.D., with Paul Perry, Ballantine Books 1991, Pg    49        .&nbsp; His findings from    his carefully designed research eliminated the theory that NDEs    are the result of drugs or sleep deprivation or that they are merely bad    dreams or the subconscious awareness of surgery. Id. at pg 46.

&quot;How    could a clear consciousness outside one's body be experienced at the    moment that brain no longer functions during a period of clinical death with    flat EEG?&quot; &nbsp;    But the truth is that    nobody knows when the NDEs reported by these patients occurred. &nbsp; Was    it really during the period of flat EEG or might they have occurred as the    patients rapidly entered or gradually recovered from that state?    THE LANCET * Vol 358 *      December 15, 2001         COMMENTARY p. 2010

This    is perhaps one of the more ludicrous skeptical arguments.&nbsp; All one has to    do is to read the experiences on the website.&nbsp; Notice that many describe    the out of body part of the experience.&nbsp; It is hard to believe that a    person can describe events (many times in the operating room) that occur after    death.&nbsp; For instance, we had one experiencer talk of floating down the    hall and hearing word for word what the nurses were saying about her    death.&nbsp; We also have several reports of experiencers reporting word for    word how relatives reacted to news of their death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Are  NDEs caused by misfiring neurons in a dying  brain?  

Although,    van Lommel could not find any medically explicable explanation for why NDEs  occur, he did acknowledge that the neurological processes had to play a part in  the NDE, noting similarities between various other phenomena such as electrical  stimulation of the temporal lobe of the brain. &nbsp; Id.  at 2044.&nbsp;  However, he also commented  on the fragmented and randomness of the memories derived by these other  mechanisms.&nbsp;  Id.&nbsp;   Only the NDE had clear recall in a sequential order as evidenced by the  life review.&nbsp;   Near  Death Experience In Survivors of Cardiac Arrest: A Prospective Study in the  Netherlands,  Pim    van Lommel, et al,  THE  LANCET ' Vol 358 '    December 15, 2001 ,&nbsp;   2044.
    
     The commentary in the Lancet talks of NDEs being the result of false  memories.&nbsp;  Interestingly, if this  were true, then this rationale could not explain why the study found that people  could recall their NDE exactly over the span of a 2-year and an 8-year period.&nbsp;       Id.     at 2041.&nbsp; a misfiring brain after death    could not explain the perfect memory recall and the sequential occurrence of    events.
