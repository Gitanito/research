THE APPRECIATION OF TIME BY SOMNAMBULES.
By T. W. Mitchell, M.D.,
Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine.
I.
Many classifications of the different stages of hypnosis have
been put forward, and it is difficult to find two authors who
are in agreement as to how many stages may be recognised,
or by what names they are to be known. All hypnotic subjects,
however, may be divided into two great groups, according to
whether the events of hypnosis are forgotten or not in the
waking state ; and the term " somnambule " has been very
generally used to describe those who, when hypnosis is termi-
nated, are totally amnesic for all that has happened during
the trance.
Although some interesting observations in regard to apprecia-
tion of time may be made in the lighter stages of hypnosis,
it is in somnambules that this power is most strikingly shown
and may be most conveniently studied. All the observations
recorded or referred to in this paper were made on somnambules,
and with regard to my own cases I can declare with the
greatest certainty that in every instance post-hypnotic amnesia
was complete.
Every one who has done much practical hypnotic work must
have observed the accuracy witli which somnambules estimate
time-intervals. If a somnambule is told in hypnosis to sleep
for five minutes, ten minutes, or half an hour, and then wake
up, it is found that awakening takes place exactly at the
time mentioned, or that, if there is an error in the time-
estimation, it is generally a very small one. It is also well
known that this power of estimating time-intervals may persist
liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules.
into post-hypnotic life, so that an action suggested in hypnosis,
to be performed in waking life after a certain interval, is
generally fulfilled at the appointed time, notwithstanding that
all knowledge of the suggestion is absent from the waking
consciousness during the intervening period.
Although this association with the hypnotic state of what
appears to be a supernormal power is well worthy of investiga-
tion, we possess very few detailed records of observations which
might help us in elucidating the many difficulties which
confront us when we try to bring the facts into line with
our ordinary psychological beliefs. In the early days of the
study of hypnotic phenomena, so much that appeared marvellous
and inexplicable was found that the appreciation of time by
somnambules must have seemed to be a very minor wonder.
Even when the attention of the Nancy investigators was turned
towards the subject, they seemed to be more surprised by the
length of time which may elapse between the giving of a
suggestion and its fulfilment than by the extraordinary accuracy
with which time-intervals of less extent are estimated. One
of Liegeois' subjects fulfilled a suggestion given in hypnosis
a year previously,1
and Beaunis produced, in one of his
somnambules, a visual hallucination after an interval of
172 days. 2
In both cases the date on which the suggestion
was to be fulfilled was given to the subject. Liegeois'
suggestion was given, on October 12th, as falling due on
" the same day next year," and the exact date was given by
Beaunis in his su«£;estion.
It was soon realised that such cases, however interesting
and remarkable they may be from another point of view, have
very little to do with any supposed power on the part of
somnambules of unconsciously reckoning duration. Both
Delboeuf and Edmund Gurney insisted on the distinction
that must be made between cases in which a date is named
and cases in which simply a length of time is given. For,
in the former case, the fulfilment of the suggestion may be
dependent on the ordinary laws of association, whilst in the
latter it would seem to imply, as Paul Janet said, some
" unknown faculty " of measuring time. It is, of course, a

commonplace of hypnotic experimentation that a suggestion
will be fulfilled, either in hypnosis or in post-hypnosis, on
the giving of a pre-arranged signal. So, if a subject in
hypnosis be told to do something on the first of January,
the arrival of that day may suffice to revive the dormant
memory of the command, and thus lead to its fulfilment.
But if he be told to perform an act on the " sixty-ninth day
from this," what is there about the sixty-ninth day to revive
the hypnotic command ? The day, when it comes, as Gurney
said, " carries no more sixty-ninthness about it than any other
day " ; and unless we are to suppose some form of conscious
watching and counting of the days as they pass, or some form
of conscious calculation, whereby the terminal day is arrived
at, and then fixed in the mind, the fulfilment of such a
command seems inexplicable.
At the time when Beaunis and Liegeois recorded their
observations, the possibility of subconscious mentation had
not been distinctly formulated. The germs of the modern
doctrine of the subliminal consciousness may now be seen to
have been latent in the speculations of certain philosophers
such as Fichte and Du Prel ; but the extravagant applications
of the principle of the " Unconscious " by Eduard von Hart-
mann, probably alienated the minds of scientific men from
all consideration of a concept apparently so directly at variance
with their empirical beliefs. So we find that the earliest
explanations of the accurate fulfilment of post-hypnotic actions
at a given time, or after a given interval, tended towards
some hypothesis of " physiological " time-reckoning rather
than towards the supposition that some form of consciousness
which watches and counts the days as they pass may be
concerned. Thus Beaunis imagined that some cerebral
mechanism exists in men and animals which can somehow
be set like a clock so as to produce a movement at a given
time. It is, he said, owing to this mechanism thc*t some
people are able to wake up at a predetermined hour, and
that an animal knows when it is feeding time.
Although the last word in the controversy has not yet
been said, I think there is no need at present to re-argue this
point of view. Notwithstanding the adherence of such eminent
authorities as Professor Miinsterberg and Professor Pdbot to
liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 5
the view that all subconscious activity is merely physiological,
it is now very widely admitted that the working of the cerebral
mechanism concerned in the fulfilment of post-hypnotic acts
has a psychical concomitant, existing, it may be, submerged
in the depths of the stream of consciousness, and not to be
discovered on introspection during waking life, yet capable
in many instances of being brought to the surface by certain
artifices, such as re-hypnotisation, so that its existence and
its persistence may be known by the subject, and may be
made apparent to the most casual or most sceptical observer.
It is, I think, no longer possible to doubt the reality of
subconscious mentation, or to evade the implications which
this admission entails.
This conception of a psychical reality accompanying sub-
conscious cerebral activity will always be associated with the
name of the late Mr. Frederic Myers. Of the great bulk of
Mr. Myers' work I do not desire, nor am I competent to
speak ; but as a student of Hypnotism I would like to
record my belief that all future hypnotic experimentation
must be based on some form of the doctrine of the Subliminal
Consciousness which we owe to him.
As a student of Medicine I am profoundly grateful for his
illuminating conception of the nature of hysteria and various
cognate states—a conception which has transformed into one
of the most fascinating and fertile fields of clinical study
what was for centuries the opprobrium of medical science.
In discussing phenomena which have been observed only
in hypnotic somnambules, we need not take into consideration
the different opinions which have been put forward in regard
to the existence of a true subliminal self in all human beings ;
nor need we define the terms subliminal and subconscious
so carefully as may be necessary in the examination of those
wider problems which have arisen around the modern con-
ception of human personality. Taking for granted the
possibility, in somnambules, of mentation going on without
the knowledge or attention of the waking consciousness—and
evidence of this will be abundantly shown in the course of
our investigation—it will suffice for our purpose to class all
such mentation as subconscious or subliminal. And in doing
so we need not bind ourselves to any particular beliefs which,
T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
on other grounds, may be held in regard to the higher problems
that meet us at every step when we try to penetrate into
those hidden recesses of man's being to which his subconscious
mental life may seem to be the gateway.
That post-hypnotic reckoning of time-intervals is not
merely physiological, but entails some concomitant mental
action, was clearly shown by Gurney. 1
On March 3rd a
suggestion to be fulfilled in thirty-nine days was given to
one of his subjects during hypnosis. No reference to the
command was made till March 19th, when he was suddenly
asked, in the trance, how many days had elapsed since it
was n'iven. He instantly said 16, and added that there were
23 more to run. It was evident " that he was in some way
actually counting the days as they passed." In another case
an account of this process was obtained. The subject said
that he generally thought about it in the morning early.
Something seemed to say to him, " You've got to count."
On being asked if that happened every day he replied :
" No,
not every day—perhaps more like every other clay. It goes
from my mind ; I never think of it during the day. I only
know it's got to be done."
Gurney concluded from these cases that a somnambule who is
told to perform a post-hypnotic act at the end of a certain
number of days, subconsciously watches and counts the days
as they pass. Notwithstanding that he himself had made many
experiments which proved that somnambules are able to make
subconscious calculations, Gurney did not think that in these
cases of time-watching any calculation was made by which the
terminal clay was arrived at, and then fixed in the mind.
I have repeated Gurney's experiments on several somnambules,
and I find that there is considerable variety in the methods used
by them for ensuring the fulfilment of the act on the proper
day. The method used by any particular subject seems to
depend on various circumstances. In the first place, it will
depend on his standard of education. If in the waking state
he is not good at mental arithmetic, or if mental arithmetic
is distasteful to him, he will probably use the most elementary
method of arriving at the correct day, namely, simply counting
1
Gurney: "Peculiarities of Certain Post-hypnotic States," Proceedings
S.P.B.. Vol. IV., p. 290.
Liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 7
the days as they pass. But if he can do sums mentally without
difficulty he will generally make some calculation, either in
hypnosis or subconsciously in post-hypnosis, so as to arrive
at the terminal day, and then fix it in his mind. More
important, however, than his arithmetical capacity, or his love
for figures in the waking state, is the extent to which his
subconscious mind has been trained by similar experiments.
When such problems are given to a subject who has already
made use of subconscious calculation in the solving of more
difficult problems of a somewhat similar nature, he will
unfailingly resort to the same method even when the accurate
fulfilment of the suggestion could be ensured by simply count-
ing the days as they passed. The following examples will
illustrate these points.
I may state, with regard to all the experiments recorded
in this paper, that I always took short notes at the time,
in the. subject's presence—in shorthand when anything more
than figures was necessary—and these were invariably written
out in full two or three hours afterwards. In nearly all
the experiments the time-intervals suggested were chosen at
random. In the earlier ones I sometimes worked out the
calculations before making the suggestions, sometimes immediately
after doing so, and sometimes later in the day when writing-
out my notes. In most of the later experiments I made
no calculation until after the subject had fulfilled the suggestion,
or had told me her solution of the problems. When the
suggestions were given in Nos. 21, 22, and 23 of the series
tabulated on page 17, Miss A., a friend of the subject, was
present. In no other instance in that series did any third
person know anything about the suggestions. Only very
exceptionally in the other experiments was there any one
present when the suggestions were given except the subject
and myself. All the subjects were good somnambules before
the experiments were begun, and there was not at any time the
slightest doubt as to the completeness of post-hypnotic amnesia.
In conducting experiments with hypnotised subjects, certain
precautions are necessary. Some of these are very obvious to
any one having knowledge of the peculiarities of hypnotic and
post-hypnotic states. Others are less obvious, and considerable
ingenuity is sometimes necessary to avoid falling into error.
8 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
The more obvious precautions are those which must be
taken to ensure that the subject does not obtain through
ordinary sensory channels any information which the experi-
menter wishes him not to have. The subject must always be
looked upon as being wide awake, or rather as being in a
state in which sensory impressions of all kinds are more
readily perceived than they are in the waking state. The
fact that his eyes are closed, or apparently closed, must never
be taken as a proof that he cannot see what is going on.
A possible hyperesthesia of all the senses must be allowed
for ; and it is much better to overdo the precautions taken
than to be careless on any point, however unimportant it may
at first sight appear to be.
From the beginning of the experiments which I am about
to record I made it a rule never to write down in the
subject's presence anything which she could possibly see by
any normal means. In making calculations in the presence
of the subject, I either went behind her or interposed some
opaque body between her face and the paper on which I was
writing. I also used a very soft sharp-pointed pencil, and
made the figures very small so as to avoid giving any informa-
tion through the sense of hearing. Such precautions may
probably be quite unnecessary ; but some of the recorded
evidence relating to sensory hyperaesthesia during hypnosis is
so extraordinary that we have no right to imperil the exactness
of our results by failing to allow for every possible source of
error.
Throughout the series of observations which I am about
to record I lay great stress on the importance of the informa-
tion given by the subject, during hypnosis, in response to
questions regarding her mental states and processes at various
times. The framing of the questions put to the subject is
to my mind the most important and the most difficult feature
in connection with experiments of this description. The diffi-
culty of putting a question in such a way that no inkling
is given of the answer you desire or expect is sometimes
almost insuperable ; and the way in which the response of the
subject may be modified by the merest change of intonation
on the part of the operator can be appreciated only by those
who have had some experience in this form of investigation.
liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 9
How to obtain the truth from a person whose every pulse
of thought is to some extent at the mercy of the faintest
suggestion of the operator is a problem which demands the
greatest care and ingenuity. When every precaution is taken,
and when there is no doubt as to the honesty of the hypnotised
subject, the danger of falsification of the subject's memory by
unconscious suggestions is the chief source of error which the
investigator has to guard against when trying to obtain a trust-
worthy account of the mental processes which go on at the
hypnotic level of consciousness. This is the main reason why it
is advisable, whenever possible, to have a verbatim report of all
questions which are put to the hypnotised subject ; for unless
the questions are carefully prepared beforehand it will often
be found that information which may have had some influence
in moulding the answer obtained has been conveyed by the
wording of the question. In my own experiments I preferred
preparing the questions beforehand. When this was not possible
I took them down in shorthand at the time.
One of my subjects, Mrs. C, is a fairly well educated
woman, but she greatly dislikes mental arithmetic, and indeed,
figures generally. In the waking state, the simplest of sums
in mental addition or multiplication distress her exceedingly.
She is a good somnambule, can be hypnotised and awakened
instantaneously, and post-hypnotic amnesia is complete. Yet
when given any sum to be worked out subconsciously in post-
hypnosis, there always seems to be some subliminal invasion
of the waking consciousness which leads to supraliminal know-
ledge that she is " doing figures in her head," although she
never knows what they mean.
On March 5th, 1907, I asked her, in hypnosis, to make
a cross on a piece of paper, on " the 39th day from this."
The matter was not referred to again until March 21st. On
being asked in the waking state if she had been doing any
sums, she said that she thought she had, but that they seemed
to be " very little ones." She had had the feeling that she had
been " adding on one every day," but she did not know how
far she had got, or to what end she was counting. I said
to her " Sleep ! How many days are gone ?
" She answered
immediately, " 16." She did not know how many days were
to come, nor when the act fell due. She remembered the
10 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
suggestion, but not the date on which it had been given. Her
sole knowledge of the matter seemed to be that she had to
make a cross on the 39 th day, and that 16 days had elapsed
since the suggestion was given.
Another subject, Mrs. T., was told, during hypnosis, in the
presence of her husband, on Sunday, January 13th, 1907, to
make a cross on a piece of paper on " the 43rd day from
this." (Due Feb. 2 5.) I did not see her again until March 1st.
I then found that the cross had been made some time before
it was due. She had not dated the paper, and she could
not remember when the cross was made. In hypnosis she
said it was made on February 17th. She knew quite well
when the cross ought to have been made, but she was hurried
by her husband asking her on the 17th if she had not some-
thing to do for me, and whether she had forgotten it or
not. She was then afraid she had made a mistake, and made
the cross that day, fearing she might be too late. On being
asked if she had made any calculation, or if she had been
counting the days, she said she had made a calculation, and had
counted the Sundays. She knew that the cross had to be
made on the day after the sixth Sunday.
This subject is a highly intelligent and well-educated woman,
and it is interesting to note how she simplified the calculation
for determining the day (7x6 + 1 = 43), and also how she
simplified the process of watching and counting the days. This
was the first time she had been experimented on ; and although
it is quite exceptional for questions during the waking state to
disturb operations of the subconscious mind which have been
set going by suggestion during hypnosis, it is probable that if
her husband had not mentioned the matter to her at all she
might have fulfilled the hypnotic command at the proper
time.
On March 1st, 1907, I asked her, in hypnosis, to make a
cross on " the 145th day from this." Immediately after giving
the suggestion I asked her when it fell due. She replied,
after about 30 seconds, that it fell due on July 24th.
(Right.) Questioned as to how she knew, she said she had
just added up the days of the months, allowing 30 days for
March, and 24 clays in July (30 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 24 = 145).
She said she would always make a calculation when such a
Li v.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambwles. 11
suggestion was made to her. She would not think of trying
to count every day as it came.
Similar experiments made on another somnambule show still
more clearly the use of calculations in connection with such
suggestions. Miss F. D. was a good somnambule, and could
be hypnotised or awakened instantaneously by uttering the
commands, " Sleep !
" and " Wake up." She had previously
been subjected to a long series of experiments involving sub-
conscious calculations, which are recorded in a later part of
this paper. On December 6th, 1906, I told her during
hypnosis to make a cross on a piece of paper on "the 39th
day from this," and to put underneath it the date of doing
so (due Jan. 14th, 1907). On December 8th I asked her
in the waking state if she knew what I had told her to do.
She of course knew nothing. I said to her suddenly, " Sleep !
When is it due?" She replied immediately, "January 14th."
On being questioned as to how she knew, she said that it
came into her head on the night of December 6th, during
natural sleep. She had no recollection of having made any
•calculation.
On January 3rd I hypnotised her and asked, " How many
•days are gone?" She replied immediately, "28" (right).
"How many to come?" "12" (wrong). "Wake up." After
she awoke I found that 12 was wrong, so I hypnotised her
and asked her if she thought her answers were right. She
said at once that 1 2 was wrong, and that there were only
11 days to come. She did not know how she had made
the mistake. She could not say how she knew the right
•answers, but she believed that she noted the days in
her sleep at night. The cross was duly made on January
14th.
On January 3rd, 1907, I made a similar suggestion to be
fulfilled on "the 145th day from this." On January 1 6th I
asked her in hypnosis if she remembered what I told her on
January 3rd. She said she did. " How many days are gone ?
"
" 13." "How many to come?" " 132." "When does it fall
•due?" "May 28th." All the answers are correct, and were
given without any hesitation. On being asked the same ques-
tions on January 29th, she said that 26 days had passed,
and 119 still to come (right). On February 16th, when doing
12 T. W. Mitchell, 31. D. [part
some experiments involving automatic writing, I asked her,
during hypnosis, to write down anything she liked after waking.
When she awoke she wrote down 101 — 44. The subject in
the waking state did not know what this meant, and as no'
reference to the suggestion of January 3rd had been made
since January 29th, I had quite forgotten about it, and did
not associate the figures with that experiment. On being
hypnotised she told me that they were meant to indicate that
there were 101 days to come and 44 gone (right). On
March 2nd she wrote automatically under similar circum-
stances. 58 — 87 (58 gone, 87 to come—right).
In this case there is clear evidence that a calculation had
been made by which the terminal day was arrived at ; but
it is curious to note that there was apparently also a con-
tinuous watching and counting of the days as they passed,,
which would seem to be quite unnecessary. This, I think,
was due to the subject's long training in experiments of this
description, and to her knowledge that I was in the habit
of questioning her about the details of her methods. It is of
course possible that there was really no counting of the days.
If she knew on each occasion what the date was, she might
have calculated, every time, the number of days gone and to
come. But the rapidity with which the replies were given
leads me to think that the knowledge must have been in
her possession before the questions were asked. It may, how-
ever, be suggested that she was subliminally on the look-out
for my question, and that she made the calculation sublimin-
ally before being hypnotised. But if there was the continuous
subliminal expectancy which such a suggestion implies, it would
surely have been much easier for her to count the days as they
passed than to make a subliminal calculation every time I
called to see her.
When the terminal day is arrived at beforehand by calcu-
lation, and no continuous counting of the days as they pass
takes place, the act is fulfilled on the proper day just as it
is when a date is mentioned in giving the suggestion. In
such cases Gurney's method of naming an interval of time
instead of a fixed date does not ensure a continuous time-
watching or demonstrate any true appreciation of the passage
of time by somnambules.
Liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 13
When Delboeuf 1
recognised the importance of not mention-
ing any fixed date for the fulfilment of the post-hypnotic act,
he thought that this difficulty could be overcome by giving
the suggestion in minutes instead of in hours or in days.
He devised this method, he says, partly to do away with the
fixing of the terminal time in giving the suggestions, and
partly in order to make it possible to carry out a number of
observations in a relatively short time. Here is an example
of Delboeufs experiments. At 6.55 a.m. he suggested to his
subject M. that at the expiration of 1500 minutes she was
to ask Madame Delboeuf if she required anything. This
suggestion was carried out with absolute accuracy. Delboeuf
made twelve experiments of this kind, the time-intervals sug-
gested varying from 350 to 3300 minutes. Two of these
were fulfilled at the moment they fell due. In three the
impulse to fulfil the suggested act arose at the right time.
In none of the others was the estimation of the time
accurate.
Delboeufs subjects were his two maid-servants, J. and M.,
who were ignorant country girls. Only with difficulty could
they tell the time by the clock, and in the waking state
they were quite incapable of reducing to hours such a number
of minutes as 1150. M. was a somewhat better arithmetician
than J., and it is important to note that in the experiments
she was more accurate in her time-estimation than J.
Inspired by Delboeufs results, Dr. Milne Bramwell took
up the subject of time-appreciation by somnambules, and he
has published a remarkable series of observations which are
deserving of the closest study.'
2
Eecognising that some of
Delboeufs failures were due to the subject's resistance to dis-
tasteful suggestions, Dr. Bramwell confined the suggested act
in all his experiments to the making of a cross on a piece
of paper at the end of a certain number of minutes. His

were in keeping with this ; she could do ordinary sums in
multiplication and subtraction with the aid of a pencil and

paper, but failed, unless they were extremely simple, to solve
them mentally."
1
The experiments were conducted as follows.
During hypnosis Miss D. was told that at the expiration of
a certain number of minutes she was to make a cross and
write down the hour she believed it to be without consulting
the clock, an interval of waking life always intervening between
the suggestion and its fulfilment. At first the arithmetical
problems involved in the experiments were relatively simple,
but later they were exceedingly complicated, and further, as
many as five or six different suggestions were given rapidly,
one after the other, in the same hypnosis. These suggestions
were fulfilled with remarkable accuracy—some in ordinary
waking life, some in subsequent hypnosis, and some during
natural sleep. The following examples will give some idea of
the nature of these experiments.
On Tuesday, Dec. 24th, 1895, at 3.10 p.m., Miss D. was
told, during hypnosis, that she was to make a cross on
a piece of paper in 7200 minutes (Exp. No. 7).
2
This fell
due to be fulfilled on Sunday, Dec. 29th. "When it was
fulfilled Miss D. was teaching a Sunday School class, when
she suddenly felt an impulse to make a cross and mark the
time. It was only after doing so that she looked at the
clock, which was behind her. Her estimation of the time was
correct."
On Jan. 8th, at 4.30 p.m., a similar suggestion was given,
to be fulfilled in 10,070 minutes (Exp. No. 12).
3
This
suggestion fell due on Jan. loth, at 4.20 p.m. When it was
fulfilled Miss D. had been hypnotised in Dr. Bramwell's
room for an hour, and had had no opportunity of consulting
the clock. Exactly at 4.20, without waking or opening her
eyes, she said she had to make a cross and put down the
time.
On Wednesday, Feb. 5th, five suggestions were given rapidly,
one after the other. Among these were No. 22- -in 840
minutes (due 6 a.m. Feb. 6th), and No. 23—in 900 minutes
(due 7 a.m. Feb. 6th).

" When Miss D.'s mother went to
her bedroom on the morning of the 6th, she found her asleep
and two pieces of paper on a table by her bedside. On each
was a rough cross; on one the figure 6, on the other 7, both

very badly written. . Misri D. said: She' had not awakened during
the night." ' -
In summarising his experiments, Dr. Bramwell says :
1
" Fifty- rive experiments are cited; of these one, apparently,
was either not carried out by Miss D., or unrecorded by me,
while in another (No. 9), she mistook the original suggestion,
but fulfilled it correctly in accordance with what she thought
it had been. Forty-five were completely successful, i.e. not
only did Miss D. write down the correct terminal time, but
this was done, also, at the moment the experiment fell due.
Eight . . . were partially successful. In these the terminal
time was correctly recorded in every instance, but there were
minute differences, never exceeding five minutes, between the
subject's correct estimate of when the suggestion fell due and
the moment at which she carried it out. The proportion
which these errors bear to their respective intervals varies
between 1 to 2028 and 1 to 21,420."
I have made a series of observations which corroborate in
many ways the results obtained by Dr. Bramwell ;
yet there
are certain points of difference which are not uninteresting.
My subject, F. D., was a delicate girl whom 1 had relieved
of some functional troubles by hypnotic suggestion. She was
thirty years of age, and lived at home with her parents,
helping in the work of the house. She had received an
elementary education at a National School, but, as will be
seen from her methods of calculation in the waking state, she
was evidently not as good an arithmetician as Dr. Bramwell's
subject. She was a good somnambule, and could be hypnotised
or awakened instantaneously simply by uttering the commands,
" Sleep !
" or " Wake up !
" All the experiments were con-
ducted on the lines laid down by Dr. Bramwell ; but
occasionally certain modifications were introduced which will
be detailed in due course. Where nothing to the contrary is
mentioned, the subject was requested, during hypnosis, to make
a cross on a piece of paper at the end of a given number
of minutes, to put down the time she thought it was when
doing so without consulting a clock or watch, to put whether
a.m. or p.m., and to add the day of the month. Where no
statement to the contrary is made, the subject was told what

the "starting time", was; < - 'From 'th6;' beginning I suggested
that she should remember, hiring made the' crosses, and that
she should keep them and give them to me. My first experi-
ment was made with the intention of finding out what her
powers of subconscious calculation were at this time. On
March 30th, 1906, at 11.15 a.m., I asked her to make a
cross in 86,400 seconds. Next day she gave me a paper
marked "11.30 p.m., March 30th." This was wrong; it
should have been 11.15 a.m., March 31st. I then began the
following series of experiments.
No. 1. March 31, 1906, 11.30 a.m.—in 700 minutes (clue
March 31, 11.10 p.m.).
When I saw her next day she gave me a paper marked
with a cross and 11.10 p.m. March 31st. On being asked
when this was written she said, " last night after I had gone
to bed. I had been asleep and woke up to do it. I remember
feeling very tired and went to sleep at once after writing it,
and slept all night."
No. 2. April 3, 1906, 11 a.m.—in 4000 minutes (due
April 6, 5.40 a.m.).
On April 5th I asked her in hypnosis if she remembered
my suggestion of April 3rd. She remembered it and repeated
it correctly. On being asked when it fell due she replied
at once, " 5.40 to-morrow morning." " Have you calculated
it ?
" " Not on paper." " How then—in your mind ?
" " Yes,
I suppose so." " When did you calculate it ?
" "I think it
was in my sleep the other night." On being awakened she
knew nothing about having to make a cross, and did not
remember having dreamt about figures.
On April 6th she gave me a paper marked " 5.40 a.m.
April 6th." She did not know what the exact time was
when she made the cross, as she did not look at her watch
for some time afterwards. When she did look it was six
o'clock. She woke up to make the cross and did not go to
sleep again.
No. 3. April 9, 1906, 4 p.m.—in 2885 minutes (due April
11, 4.5 p.m.).
As soon as the suggestion was given she was told that

18 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
when she woke up she would be asked to read aloud from
a book, and that while reading she would write out the
suggestion, and, if possible, the time when it fell due to be
fulfilled. She was then awakened and given a book to read
aloud. A pencil and paper were placed on the table close
to her right hand. After reading a few lines she took up
the pencil and began to write while continuing her reading.
She made a cross, wrote 2885, and then stopped both
reading and writing, put the pencil down, saying, " I can't do
two things at once." I told her to go on reading and not
to mind anything else. She did so, and while reading she
again took up the pencil and wrote April 9. I stopped the
reading and said, " You have not written clown when it falls
due." She immediately wrote " 5 to 4." I re-hypnotised her
and told her I thought 5 to 4 was not quite right. She
said at once " Yes 5 to 4 is wrong, it is 5 past 4." On
being asked if she had made any calculation she said, " No,
how could I ? I have not had time." " How then do you
know ?
" "I don't know how I know." " But you are sure
5 past 4 is right?" "Yes."
On April 12 th she gave me a paper marked " 5 past
4 p.m. Apr. 11." She knew nothing about this in the
waking state except that she had written it. In hypnosis
she knew that she had written it in response to my suggestion
of April 9th.
An attempt was now made to find out if more difficult
problems required a longer time for the subconscious calculation
to be made correctly. The plan adopted was to explain in
hypnosis that a problem requiring an answer would be put
and that she was to write down the answer as soon as she
awoke. The problem was then given and the subject
immediately awakened.
No. 4. On April 12th, 1906, I said to the subject in
hypnosis
:
"If, counting from to-day, Thursday, at 12 o'clock, you
make a cross in 3090 minutes, when will it fall due ?
Wake up
!
" She awoke and almost immediately went over
to the table and wrote: "11.20 p.m., April 15th." This
is wrong. It should have been 3.30 p.m., April 14th. I
liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 19
hypnotised her and asked what my question was. She
repeated it, giving 3900 minutes instead of 3090. Still her
answer would have been wrong. I told her to try again
with 3090 minutes and to tell me the answer immediately
on waking up. I awoke her and she said at once: "1.30,
April 14th." Another trial was made and she was told to
take time if necessary. On awaking she said after a few
minutes: "6.30, April 14th." This being wrong, and as
she seemed to be getting confused, I re-hypnotised her and
told her to tell me the answer the next time I saw her, if
she could not do so before T left. I then awoke her and
talked to her for about five minutes before going away.
Next day as soon as I saw her she told me that just as I
was leaving on the previous day she felt inclined to say to
me: "3.30, April 14th"; but she did not know what it
meant and thought it sounded silly, so did not say anything.
No. 5. On April 13th, 1906, I asked her in hypnosis to
tell me as soon as she could after waking, how many days,
hours, etc. are in 7410 minutes. Awakened immediately
she replied after a few minutes: "5 days, 160 hours."
Told to try again she said: "5 days, 140 hours" In
hypnosis she told me these answers were wrong, but she
could not tell me the correct one. As I could not wait
longer I told her to write down the answer as soon as she
could, noting on the paper the time at which she did so.
I left her at 12 30 p.m.
When I saw her on April 15th she gave me a paper
marked: "5 days, 123J hours, 12.40 p.m., April 13th."
She said she had got up to write this in the middle of her
dinner soon after I left on April 13th. She had sat down
to dinner immediately after I had gone away, and was
talking and laughing with her people all the time until she
suddenly felt that she must get up and write this. When
she had written it she did not know what it meant.
I could not understand the answer at first, as 5 days plus
123^ hours is so obviously wrong. But 123 J hours =7410
minutes. In hypnosis she told me that she understood me
to want the number of days and the number of hours. Her
previous attempts had been in this direction.
20 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
No. 6. April 15, 1906, 12 noon—in 17,505 minutes (due
April 27, 3.45 p.m.).
Next day I asked her in hypnosis if she remembered the
suggestion given on April 15th. She repeated it correctly.
Asked when it fell due she replied at once: "3.45 p.m.,
April 27th." In response to questioning she said she thought
she had arrived at this conclusion in the night. She was
not conscious of having made any calculation. All she knew
was that she remembered " thinking about the question and
the answer " in the night. In the waking state she knew
nothing at all about the matter.
On April 24th, after the fulfilment of the next experiment,
she was asked in hypnosis if she had any other crosses to
make during the coming week. She said she did not think
so—she could not remember any. The fact that she had
told me that the suggestion of April 15th fell due on
April 27 th seemed to have faded for the time being from
her memory. Nevertheless, on April 27th the suggestion
was fulfilled in my presence. At 3.40 p.m., while awake
and talking to me, she suddenly became restless, and I asked
her what was the matter. She said she felt she had to
write down something. I said, " Come along and do it, then."
She immediately came to the table, made a cross on a piece
of paper and wrote: "3.45 p.m., April 27th." It was then
just past 3.40. The suggestion was fulfilled, therefore, about
five minutes too soon. I think, however, that this error was
probably due to my telling her to " come and do it " as
soon as she explained to me the reason for her restlessness.
For I have frequently observed that a cross made in my
presence is preceded for some minutes by a certain amount
of restlessness, and that if she is not interfered with in any
way the suggested act will be performed usually at the
exact time at which it falls due.
No. 7. April 21, 1906, 4.15 p.m.—in 4305 minutes (clue
April 24, 4 p.m.).
This suggestion was fulfilled in my presence on April 24th
at 4 p.m. exactly. At 3.55, while in hypnosis, she became
rather restless and sighed frequently. On being asked why
she sighed she said she did not know, but that she seemed
Liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 21
to have something on her mind. " Do you know what it
is ?
" I enquired. " No ! I think I have to do something."
Being desirous to see if a similar restlessness would appear
in the waking; state I awoke her. She talked to me without
any seeming preoccupation, and I held her attention constantly
by questioning her on matters of interest to her. While
continuing the conversation she began searching in her pocket
and brought out a pencil. I paid no attention to what she
was doing and kept her engaged in conversation. Suddenly
she said :
" Excuse me a minute, I must go and get a piece
of paper." " What do you want a piece of paper for ?
"
" I've got to write something." " Do you know what it is ?
"
" No." She was by this time at the door of the room. I
told her that I could give her a piece of paper, so she came
back to the table and prepared to write. " Do you know
what you have to write now ?
" " Yes." She immediately
made a cross and wrote :
" 4 p.m., April 24th." It was then
exactly 4 o'clock. In the waking state she knew nothing
about what she had written except that she had written it.
In hypnosis she knew what she had written and what it
meant. She did not remember having thought of the matter
at all, since I made the suggestion, unless she did so in
her sleep on the first night. She was not aware of having
made any calculation, and she did not know how she knew
when to make the cross.
No. 8. Wednesday, April 25, 1906, 4 p.m.—in 2880
minutes (due 4 p.m., April 27).
After giving the suggestion I asked her when it fell due.
She replied immediately, " 4 o'clock on Thursday—no, Friday
—4 o'clock on Friday." (April 27.) She said she did not
make any calculation—" it just came into my head." This
suggestion was fulfilled, in hypnosis, on April 27, at 4 p.m.,
in my presence.
No. 9. April 26, 11 a.m. —in 1710 minutes (due April 27,
3.30 p.m.).
Immediately after giving the suggestion, and before hypnosis
terminated, I asked her when it fell due. She could not
give the answer at once, but after a few minutes, during
which I talked to her about her health, I again asked when
22 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
it fell due, and she replied, " 3.30 to-morrow." (Right.) She
said she had not been thinking about it or trying to calcu-
late while I was talking to her ; she was attending to what
I was saying. The suggestion was fulfilled in hypnosis on
April 27th, at 3.30 p.m., in my presence.
No. 10. April 29, 11.20 a.m.—in 40,360 minutes (due 12
noon, May 27).
On being asked when this fell due she laughed and said
she did not know. After a few minutes she said it was
about 30 days. (It is 28 days, 40 minutes.) She could not
give me any more definite answer.
On May 1st I told her in hypnosis that in the future I
should refer to her in the waking state as Miss I) g,
and in the hypnotic state as Florence. This was done in
order to make her understand more easily my direc-
tions in regard to some experiments in automatic
writing. Thus I said, " When you wake up I shall
give Miss D g a book to read and she will confine her
attention to what she is reading, while you, Florence, will
write down answers to questions which I shall put to you."
I awoke her and gave her a book to read aloud. I put a
pencil in her right hand and told her not to pay any atten-
tion to what her right hand might do, but to go on reading.
While she was reading I said in a low voice, close to her
ear, " What is your name ?
" Very slowly her hand wrote
" Florence." " What did I tell you on Sunday—something
you had to do?" She wrote " 40630 " and something inde-
cipherable. " When does it fall due ?
" She wrote " May
27." "What time?" She wrote "4.30." "What day is
that ?
" " Sunday." All this was done with considerable
effort ; when the hand wrote the reading was hesitating. The
writing was done very slowly and badly.
The figures written down being wrong, and the terminal
time also being wrong, I hypnotised her and asked her for
an explanation. She said she was not sure whether I had
said 40,630 or 40,360. She had thought about it in her
sleep on Sunday night and could not decide which it was.
If it was 40,360 it would fall due, she said, at 12 o'clock
on the same day. Her answers are correct. I told her
liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 23
that my suggestion was 40,360 minutes, and that she must
make a cross at the end of that time. I told her also to
make a cross at the end of 40,630 minutes, so I number
this suggestion as a separate experiment.
No. 11. April 29, 1906, 11.20 a.m.—in 40,630 minutes
(due 4.3 0 p.m., May 27).
On May 27 th she gave me two papers, one marked
"12 o'clock noon, May 27," and the other "3.10 p.m.,
May 27." I did not notice that the time given on the
second paper was wrong. On June 5th I questioned her
during hypnosis on the matter, and she said she thought 3.10
was correct. She did not remember having told me the
correct answer on May 1st. She said she thought she must
have got confused, as she had made so many crosses. She
now saw that 3.10 is wrong, and that the difference between
40,360 minutes and 40,630 minutes is hours ; so that
if 12 noon is right for one the other must be 4.30 p.m.
No. 12. May 1, 1906, 12 noon—in 10,080 minutes (due
May 8, 12 noon).
I chose this number at random, and did not know when
the cross fell due. Immediately after giving the suggestion
I asked her when it fell due. In about 30 seconds she
replied " On May 8th." " At what time ?
" "I don't know
—about 12 o'clock, I think." "You do not feel very sure
about it?" "No." As I did not know when it fell due I
did not question her any further. Her answer is correct.
The cross was made at 12 noon on May 8th. As soon as
she made it she went into the kitchen and asked her father
what the time was. He said it was just one minute and a
half past twelve.
No. 13. May 3, 1906, 4 p.m.—in 14,350 minutes (due
May 13, 3.10 p.m.).
No. 14. May 3, 1906, 4.30 p.m.—in 9275 minutes (due
May 10, 3.5 a.m.).
On May 10th she gave me a paper marked "3.5 a.m.,
May 10th." She said she was not quite awake when she
made the cross. After making it she lay down for a few
24 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
minutes and then woke up more completely and looked at
her watch. It was then 3.12 a.m.
On May 13th she gave me a paper marked " 3.10 p.m.,
May 13." This was the fulfilment of No. 13.
I had by some error put 3.30 p.m. in my note-book as the
terminal time for this experiment. Twice in the preceding
week I had asked the subject in hypnosis when this cross
fell due, and each time she answered, " 3.10 p.m., May 13th."
I thought this wrong but said nothing. Now that she had
made the cross at 3.10 I tried to find out how she had made
the calculation, and how the mistake, as I thought it, had arisen.
In hypnosis she maintained that she knew nothing of how she
had arrived at the terminal time. I then asked her to open
her eyes without waking up and to do the calculation on
paper. "If," I said, "you make a cross in 14,350 minutes
after 4 p.m. on May loth, when will it fall due?" She
took a pencil and wrote down 1440. This she multiplied
by 10, and from the sum so obtained she subtracted 14,350.
She then said it would fall due on May 25th at 50 minutes
before 4 p.m., or at 3.10 p.m. I questioned her as to her
method of calculation. "What," I said, "does 1440 stand
for ?
" " That is the number of minutes in a day." " How
do you know ?
" " Why, any one would know that." " Why
did you multiply it by 10?" "That is the number of days
—14,400 is the number of minutes in 10 days—that would
be 4 p.m. on the 25th—14,350 is 50 minutes less, so that
makes it 3.10."
She was awakened ; and it must be remembered that she
was always totally amnesic in the waking state for all that
had happened during hypnosis. I asked her if she could
calculate when 14,350 minutes after 4 p.m. on May 15
would fall due. She said she did not think she could. I
told her to take a pencil and work it out on paper. She
thought for a minute and then put down 720 and multiplied
it by 2. The result she multiplied by 5, and the sum so
obtained she multiplied by 2, thus getting 14,400. Then
she subtracted 14,350 from 14,400 and said the time would
be 3.10 p.m. in 7 days after the 15th, or on May 22nd.

pointed out to her did she see that multiplying 7200

seven.
No. 15. May 6, 1906, 12 noon—in 3090 minutes (due
May 8, 3.30 p.m.).
This suggestion was given in the waking state. I had
been making some experiments as to her power of appreciating
the passage of short periods of time when the suggestion was
Given in the waking state, and I had found that her time
estimations were then as accurate as when the suggestions
were given during hypnosis. So I tried what the result
would be if a suggestion involving calculation were given in the
waking state. Endeavouring in every way to make sure that
she kept awake I made the suggestion given above. I told
her all she had to do was to get the figures into her head,
and that she was not to make any conscious calculation either
on paper or mentally. This she quite understood and agreed
to. She had no idea when the cross fell due. She was not
re-hypnotised.
This suggestion was fulfilled correctly during hypnosis in
my presence. On being asked in the waking state what she
knew about the suggestion given on May 6th, she said that
when at dinner, about half an hour after I left her, while
she and her people were talking and laughing, " 3.30 p.m.,
May 8th," suddenly came into her head. She knew it was
the answer to the problem I had given her. She had not
troubled or made any calculation in regard to it, and did not
know whether it was right or not. She had recollected the
matter once or twice since, but had not troubled about it.
The whole experiment seems to have differed from those
in which the suggestions were given in hypnosis only in the
fact that the solution of the problem as to the terminal time
came into her mind in the waking state, and in that she had
knowledge of the experiment in the waking state. She could
recollect that she had a cross to make at a certain time. She
did not, however, worry about doing it at the right time
although she meant to do it. The prompting to do it at the
time it was due seemed to differ little, if at all, from what
she felt in the ordinary experiments.
26 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
No. 16. May 8, 1906, 4 p.m.—in 42,312 minutes (due
June 7, 1.12 a.m.).
No. 17. May 8, 1906, 4 p.m.—in 184,620 minutes (due
September 13, 9 p.m.).
On May 10th I asked her, during hypnosis, if she remembered
the suggestions given on May 8th. She repeated them correctly.
As to the solutions, she said she only knew one, which she
gave correctly—1.12 a.m., June 7th. The other, she said, was
a long time—September, about the 9th or 10th, probably about
9 a.m., but she was not sure about this. (9 p.m., Sept. 13,
is the right time.) She was not questioned again in regard
to this suggestion until June 4th, when she said it fell due
on September 14th at 1.40 p.m. On being asked how many
days, hours, and minutes are in 184,620 minutes she said
129 days 9 hours 12 minutes. (Wrong—there are 128 days
5 hours.) I then told her to work it out on paper without
waking up. She did so as follows
:
1440
129
12960 1440
2880 1140
1440 300
185760 300
184620
1140
Having done this she said there are 128 days 5 hours
(right). The method of calculation seems to be as follows
:
1440 x 129 = the number of minutes in 129 days. Therefore
the suggested number of minutes is less than 129 days. How
much less? She subtracts 184,620 from 185,760. It is
1140 minutes less. She then subtracts 1140 from 1440.
The suggested number of minutes, therefore equals 128 days
and 300 minutes ; and 300 minutes are equal to 5 hours.
The last 300 put down in the sum was, she said, the result
of the mental calculation, 60x5.
She could give no reason why she chose 129 as the
multiplier ; she said it just seemed to be the right number.
In connection with this calculation I may mention that on
a subsequent day I asked her in hypnosis how she would
Liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 27
set about calculating mentally the number of days, hours,
and minutes in 17 :
700 minutes. She said at once that she
would multiply 1440 by 12. After about a minute she
said that would give 17,280. Then she would subtract
280 from 700, and so on. When asked why she multiplied
by 12 rather than by 9, 10, or 11, she said she did not
know; she seemed to feel that it ought to be 12. She
thought that when she worked out similar calculations in her
natural sleep she did them in the same way, but that she
went into such a very deep sleep when doing them that she
could not remember anything about the actual calculations
afterwards (i.e. in her ordinary sleep state, or in hypnosis.
She was not referring to amnesia during wakino life ; for she
recognised that this always occurred in regard to the mental
operations of all varieties of her sleep-state).
Both suggestions given on May 8th were fulfilled in due
course at the proper times.
No. 18. June 5, 1906, 12 noon—in 87,145 minutes (due
August 5, 12.25 a.m.).
No. 19. June 5, 1906, 12 noon —in 214,895 minutes (due
November 1, 5.35 p.m.).
On June 8th, during hypnosis, she answered correctly both
problems. No. 18 was fulfilled in natural sleep and was not
witnessed. No. 19 was witnessed, and the time verified by a
friend who was staying with the subject. This friend, Miss A.,
witnessed and verified the accuracy of most of the subsequent
experiments.
No. 20. June 14, 1906, 4.15 p.m.—in 26,385 minutes (due
July 2, 12 midnight).
Immediately after giving the suggestion I asked her when
it fell due, but she said she did not know. I then told her
to write clown the answer as soon as she did know it, and
to put down also the time and date of doing so, and to have
it witnessed by Miss A., in whose company she would be for
the rest of the day. She was then awakened and I left at
4.30 p.m.
28 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
Ou June 17th she gave me a paper marked with a cross
and "12 o'clock midnight, July 2nd." Below this was written
" 5.38 p.m., June 14th." It was signed by Miss A., who
told me that after I left on June 14th, F. D. was with her
all the time until 5.38 when the answer to the problem was
written. They had been talking all the time, and at the
moment F. D. felt impelled to write, she was sewing. She
had not been asleep in the interval.
I had chosen the figures at random, and when the solution
was shown to me none of the three of us knew whether it
was correct or not until I worked it out on paper. Miss A.
was not present when the suggestion was given.
The subject understood that this experiment was made for
the sake of testing how long it took her to arrive at the
solution of the arithmetical problem, and the cross was not
made on July 2nd.
No. 21. June 17, 1906, 12.15 p.m.—in 3762 minutes (due
June 20, 2.57 a.m.).
I told her to write the answer to this problem as soon as
she could after waking. I told Miss A. to watch F. 1). all
the time and to note the time at which the answer was
recorded.
Immediately after the suggestion was given the subject was
awakened and I went away. The solution was recorded at
12.40. Miss A. told me that she kept F. D. in constant
conversation from the time I left until the answer was
written down.
The suggestion was fulfilled in the early morning of June
20 th.
A few experiments were now made in which the subject
was not told what the " starting time " was.
No. 22. June 23, 1906 (1.10 p.m.), "from now" in 135
minutes (due 3.25 p.m.).
Before I gave the suggestion the subject had been in
hypnosis for 20 minutes and had no ordinary means of knowing
the time. The suggestion was that in 135 minutes she should
go into the garden and pick some flowers which she would
give to Miss A. I asked Miss A. not to let F. D. out of her
liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 29
sight for an instant, to keep her away from clocks or watches
until the suggestion was fulfilled, and to note the time when
this took place.
On June 24th, Miss A. gave me a paper, written and signed
by herself, stating that F. D. gave her three flowers at 3.22 p.m.,
after spending six minutes in the garden.
No. 23. June 24, 1906 (12.25 p.m.), "from now "—in
7200 minutes (due June 29, 12.25 p.m.).
This suggestion was fulfilled at the proper time. The
making of the cross was witnessed, and the time verified, by
Miss A.
No. 24. July 1, 1906 (3.59 p.m.), "from now "—in 2935
minutes (due July 3, 4.54 p.m.).
No. 25. July 1, 1906 (3.59 p.m.), "from now"—in 8935
minutes (due July 7, 8.54 p.m.).
No. 24 was fulfilled at 4.55 p.m. July 3rd, and No. 25 at
8.55 p.m. July 7th. In both cases the time was verified
by Miss A. in whose presence the crosses were made. These
results are practically correct, as it was probably 4 o'clock
before the giving of the suggestions was completed.
No. 26. July 8, 1906 (12.2 p.m.), "from now "—in 1705
minutes (clue July 9, 4.27 p.m.).
Just after giving the suggestion I asked her if she knew
what the time was. She said it was 12 o'clock. The cross
was made at 4.30 p.m. on July 9th. When asked in
hypnosis after its fulfilment what the time was when the
suggestion was given, she said it was 12.5 p.m.
No. 27. July 8, 1906, 12.10 p.m.—in 3145 minutes (due
July 10, 4.35 p.m.).
This suggestion was fulfilled at the correct time.
No. 28. July 16, 1906 (12.30 p.m.), "from now "—in 4580
minutes (due July 19, 4.50 p.m).
This suggestion was fulfilled at 4-. 10 p.m. on July 19th and
was witnessed by Miss A. When, after its fulfilment, the
subject was asked in hypnosis what time she thought it was
30 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
when the suggestion was given she said 12.20. When asked
how many days, hours, and minutes are in 4,580 minutes she
replied immediately, "3 days, 4 hours, and 20 minutes." The
result of this experiment clearly points to her dependence on
the calculations rather than to any true appreciation of time
as it passes. She supposed, or guessed, that the starting
time was 12.20 instead of 12.30 and fulfilled the suggestion
in accordance with her calculation from the supposed time.
No. 29. July 16, 1906, 1 p.m.—in 7460 minutes (due July
21, 5.20 p.m.).
This suggestion was fulfilled at the correct time and was
witnessed by Miss A.
No. 30. July 22, 1906, 12.20 p.m.—in 274,800 seconds
(due July 25, 4.40 p.m.).
When I had given this suggestion she said she could not
do seconds, and again that she did not think she would do
it correctly. This belief was no doubt based upon her
remembrance of her complete failure in the preliminary
experiment made on March 30th. Nevertheless No. 30 was
fulfilled correctly on July 25 th at 4.40 p.m. and was
witnessed by Miss A.
The results of the foregoing experiments having convinced
me that the method employed did not necessitate on the
part of the subject any continuous watching of the time as
it passed, I sought some way of giving the suggestions which
would do so. So far there is evidence only that a sub-
conscious calculation is made soon after the suggestion is
given ; and if the date so arrived at is some weeks ahead,
the subconscious mind, having noted the time at which the
act is to be performed, seems able to go off duty as it were
and simply wait for the arrival of the proper day.
But the experiments may be so arranged as to make it
impossible for any immediate calculation to be made, and to
make an almost continuous watching of the passage of time
a requisite of success. The method I have adopted is to
make the subject tell the number of days, hours, or minutes
which elapse between the giving of the suggestion and a
pre-arranged signal ; the time at which the signal will be
liv.] The Apjireciation of Time by Somnarnbules. 31
given being left undetermined when making the suggestion.
The results of this method of investigation are made more
striking by the use of automatic writing. It is possible in
this way to get the result of the subconscious watching of
the time without having to re-induce hypnosis. An example
will illustrate what I mean.
On February 16th, 1907, at 12.30 p.m., I made the fol-
lowing suggestion to F. D. in hypnosis :
" The next time I
call to see you, as soon as I give you a pencil and paper,
you will write down the number of hours and minutes
that will have elapsed between 12.30 p.m. to-day and the
moment at which I give you the pencil." When I made
this suggestion the date of my next visit was unknown even
to myself.
On February 20th I called to see her at 10.35 a.m.—
a
very unusual hour for my visit. At 10.40, before hypnotis-
ing her, I gave her a pencil and a piece of paper. She
immediately wrote down " 94-—10." She was wide awake,
and on being questioned she denied all knowledge of having
written anything. In hypnosis she said that what she had
written was meant for 94 hours 10 minutes, that being the
time that had elapsed since I made the suggestion on
February 16th. The answer is correct. She could give no
explanation of how she knew. She admitted that she might
have thought over the matter in her sleep at night, but she
did not remember having made any calculation. She had no
recollection of having thought anything about it that morning
(February 20th). She had been very busy and had not
noticed what time it was when I called.
On February 20th, 1907, I made a similar suggestion at
11 a.m., the interval this time to be expressed in minutes
instead of in hours.
On February 25 th I called to see her at 12.50 p.m. At
12.55, before hypnotising her, I gave her a pencil and paper.
She smiled and asked what she had to do now. As she did
not write immediately I engaged her in conversation on a
subject that interested her, and she talked to me quite freely
and intelligently. At the end of two minutes she wrote
down "7315." (This is the correct number of minutes from
11 a.m., February 20th, to 12.55 p.m., February 25th.) I
32 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
paid no attention to the writing for a few minutes. At a
pause in the conversation, covering the paper with my hand,
I asked her if she had written anything. She did not know.
She thought she had noticed her hand moving, but she was
not sure. I showed the figures to her, but she did not know
what they meant. In hypnosis she knew what she had.
written and what it meant. She also remembered the conver-
sation which took place while she was awake during the two
minutes preceding the writing of the figures. On being asked
how she kept the record of the time she said she did not
know. She had no recollection of making any calculation
after I had given her the pencil. On being put into a
deeper stage of hypnosis and questioned she said she remem-
bered adding 25 to 7290. She "knew" that it was 12.55
when I gave her the pencil, and she knew that at 12.30 the
number of minutes that had elapsed was 7290. She thought
that she kept the record up to time every half hour, but she
was not sure about this.
In these experiments I think there was a continuous sub-
conscious watching of the time as it passed, and I believe
that the only calculation employed was the mental addition
which took place at regular or irregular intervals. What
these intervals were I could not find out. It may, however,
be suggested that instead of watching and counting the hours
and minutes as they passed, F. D. made a subconscious cal-
culation after I arrived. I do not deny that this may be a
possible explanation ; but considering the length of time she
usually took to do such calculations subconsciously, I do not
think that she could have arrived at the correct answer in
the short time which elapsed between my arrival and the
production of the writing.
I have repeated these experiments on another subject, Mrs.
C, who, as I have already said, disliked figures and was not
good at mental arithmetic. In this case I obtained the
answers by automatic speech instead of writing. On February
21st, 1907, at 3.20 p.m., I gave the following suggestion to
Mrs. C. :
' It is now twenty minutes past three. The next
time I call to see you, when I ask '
How long ?' you will
tell me how many hours will have elapsed from now till
then." I called to see her on February 27th at 3.20 p.m.,
liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 33
and at once asked "How long?" She replied at once "144
hours." (Right.) In the waking state she said she did not know
what this meant; but she said she had felt conscious that she had
been counting the hours. At first she did not know what
this counting meant and thought it silly, but she came to
the conclusion that it was something I had asked her to do.
She did not consciously count ; but every few hours a num-
ber came into her head. She sometimes found herself think-
ing of some number of hours in the middle of the night
when awake. In hypnosis she could give me no further
information. In deep hypnosis she said she remembered
thinking of 144 hours while lying reading just immediately
before I entered the room.
On February 27th, 1907, at 3.30 p.m., a similar sugges-
tion was given to Mrs. C, the interval to be expressed in
minutes instead of in hours. On March 5th, at 3.40 p.m.,
when she was asked "How long?" she said, after a few
minutes, " 8735 minutes." (Wrong—85 too many.) In the
waking state she said that she had been greatly troubled by the
feeling that she had been adding up figures, but she did not know
what they meant. In hypnosis she knew that she had been
adding up the minutes since 3.30 p.m. on February 27th,
but she did not know how often she made the additions.
In deep hypnosis she said that her last addition had been
8395 + 340. This was made after I asked her "How
long?" but she did not know how she had got these figures.
II.
Delboeufs experiments on his subjects M. and J., and Dr.
Bramwell's experiments on Miss D. have many points in
common with those numbered 1 to 30 which I have just
recorded. In all, the suggestions were given in such a way
as to necessitate some calculation whereby the moment at
which the act fell due became known to the subject's sub-
conscious intelligence. That such a calculation was made by
their subjects is admitted by both Delboeuf and Dr. Bram-
well ; but they both seem to have forgotten the main
object which Delboeuf had in view when he devised the
plan of giving the suggestions in minutes instead of in days.
c
34 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
That object was to eliminate the giving of a fixed date for-
the fulfilment of the hypnotic command.
Now it must be apparent that when the subject has made
a calculation by which he arrives at the terminal time, his
subconscious intelligence is as surely in possession of a fixed
date as if it had been mentioned to him when the sugges-
tion was given. When Delboeuf at 6.30 a.m. told J. to pull
the cook's nose in 1600 minutes,1
he might just as well
have told her to do so at 9.10 a.m. —provided that she was
able to make the necessary calculation. As a matter of fact
J. was a very poor arithmetician, and her calculation was wrong
by 60 minutes. In the same way when Dr. Bramwell, at
3.30 p.m., on February 26th, told Miss D. to make a cross
on a piece of paper in 20,180 minutes,2
he might just as
well have told her to make it at 3.50 p.m., on March 11th:
for Miss D. was very good at this sort of mental arithmetic.
When this experiment came to be fulfilled it was evident
that Miss D. had correctly calculated the terminal time, but
the cross was not made until 3.51^-. This slight discrepancy
between the calculation made and the appreciation of the time
points us to a fundamental distinction which should be made
in considering these and similar experiments. If we do not
keep separate these totally different questions, the results
appear to be more astonishing and inexplicable than they
really are. How subconscious calculations of the kind neces-
sary in these experiments can be performed by half-educated
girls is one problem ; how somnambules can appreciate the
passage of time, so as to know when the terminal minute so
calculated arrives, is another and a totally different problem.
Each observer has encountered certain difficulties in under-
standing how the necessary calculations were or could have
been performed by the subjects. The ignorant peasant girls
with whom Delboeuf experimented were in his opinion abso-
lutely incapable, in the waking state, of reducing to. hours
such a number of minutes as 1150. Unfortunately Delboeuf
did not examine M. to see whether during hypnosis her
arithmetical powers were any better than during the waking-
state. He did, however, test J.'s powers during hypnosis, but
delboeuf, Proceedings S. P. B., Vol. VIII., p. 418.
- Bramwell, Hypnotism, p. 128.
liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Sornnambules. 35
he does not say whether they were better or worse than
during the waking state. They were certainly very feeble,
since after ten minutes of severe mental effort she failed to
tell how many hours are in 300 minutes. But it may be
noticed that J. succeeded very seldom in fulfilling hypnotic
commands at the right time. If we disregard for the time
being any errors that may have been due to faulty time
appreciation, and suppose that all her errors were due to mis-
calculation, we find that she made the same sort of mistakes
in the experiments cited by Delboeuf as she made when
trying to do calculations during hypnosis or in the waking
state. Further, although J. was unable, during hypnosis, even
after struggling with the problem for ten minutes, to tell
how many hours are in 300 minutes, it is possible that she
might have arrived at the correct solution had she been
allowed five hours in which to make the calculation. And
that is practically the length of time that would have been
at the disposal of her subconscious intelligence if she had
been told in hypnosis to perform some act at the end of
300 minutes. All through the ensuing hours her subcon-
scious mind would have been free to grapple with the
problem, and it is probable that she would have arrived at
the correct solution and would have fulfilled the command
at or about the proper time.
Delboeuf's neglect of questioning his subjects in hypnosis
with regard to their fulfilment of the suggestions, while
diminishing the value of his observations and leaving much
untold that might have been of interest, yet saved him from
encountering the more formidable difficulties which Dr. Bram-
well had to contend with when he tried to find out how
his subject made the calculations in the series of experiments
of which he has given so admirable a record.
At an early stage in his investigation Dr. Bramwell
attempted to find out during hypnosis the subject's mental
condition in reference to the suggestions. In reply to his
questions she informed him:1
(1) That when the suggestions
were made in hypnosis she did not calculate when they fell
due. (2) That she did not calculate them at any time
afterwards during hypnosis. (3) That she had no recollection
1
Bramwell, Hypnotism, p. 122.
36 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
of them when hypnosis terminated. (4) That no memory of
them afterwards rose in the waking state. (5) That shortly
before their fulfilment she always experienced a motor impulse,
i.e. her fingers moved as if to grasp a pencil and to perform
the act of writing. (6) That this impulse was immediately
followed by the idea of making a cross and writing certain
figures. (7) That she never looked at clock or watch until
after she had made her record.
On almost all of these points my own observations on F. D.
are in complete agreement with Dr. Bramwell's findings. The
only noticeable difference is in regard to the awareness of the
motor impulse. F. D. certainly had a motor impulse, but she
was aware of it only as a vague feeling that she had to do
something. This vague feeling soon became defined, and she
knew that she had to make a cross and write down the time.
Another and more important difference between Dr. Bram-
well's results and mine is to be found in connection with the
hypnotic memory of the suggestions in the period intervening
between the time when they were given and their fulfilment.
Dr. Bramwell says that when Miss D. was questioned in
hypnosis as to unfulfilled suggestions, " she invariably recalled
the fact that these had been made, but rarely remembered
their exact terms. She always asserted that she had never
thought of them, did not know how much time had elapsed
since they had been given nor when they were due." 1
From the very beginning of my experiments on F. D. I
found that when hypnotised in the period intervening between
the giving of a suggestion and its fulfilment, she almost
invariably remembered the exact terms of the suggestion,
when it had been given, and knew when its fulfilment fell
due. Yet she, like Dr. Bramwell's subject, denied all know-
ledge of having made any calculation. The most that she
would admit was that she thought of figures sometimes in
her sleep ; but she could not remember any calculation although
she sometimes said that she remembered thinking of the questions
and the answers on these occasions. In the waking state
she had no recollection of dreaming about figures.
This absence of hypnotic memory as to the manner in
which the calculations were made is regarded by Dr. Bramwell
bramwell, Hypnotism, p. 137.
liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 37
as one of the principal points which demand explanation in
connection with his experiments.1
Since the acts of hypnotic
life, with certain well-marked exceptions which he cites, are
performed consciously, and can be recalled by suggestion in
subsequent hypnoses ; and since, further, the hypnotic memory
is more exact and far reaching than the normal one, the
absence of memory in hypnosis as to given circumstances of
hypnotic life, other than those which he cites, is regarded
by him as markedly suspicious.2
From what we know of
hypnotic memory, he thinks it is impossible to doubt that
if calculations had been made by the subjects, they would
have been able to remember them when again hypnotised.
In the reasoning which led him to this conclusion Dr.
Bramwell seems to have made an assumption which is not
warranted in the present state of knowledge. The memory in
hypnosis of the events of previous hypnoses is as a rule very
complete ; but we have no evidence that re-hypnotisation will
enable us to revive in the mind of the subject all subliminal
mentation that may have taken place during waking life.
In fact so far as this question has been made a subject of
investigation, the available evidence, when closely examined,
points rather to an opposite conclusion. In many of Gurney's
experiments on automatic writing it was found that the subject
when re-hypnotised could not remember what he had written
automatically in the waking state until he had visualised the
actual writing which he had produced. This ignorance in
hypnosis of the content of subliminal thought was still more
apparent when some simple calculation had to be made
1
Bramwell, Hypnotism, pp. 409, 410.
2
I am not quite sure what Dr. Bramwell means by " markedly suspicious.
"
He does not, I imagine, mean to impugn the subject's good faith, although
that is the interpretation which first suggests itself to the reader. Nor do I
think he means that the absence of memory is evidence either of absence of
consciousness or of the non-making of calculations. He admits that calculations
are made and that they are made by "some intelligence." What I think he does
mean is that the absence of memory is strong evidence that the calculations are
not made by the "hypnotic self.*' He says: "The fact that nothing could
be recalled by the ordinary hypnotic self regarding calculations which must
inevitably have been made in some form of hypnosis, apparently showed that
the subject possessed a third substratum of the personality" (op. cit. p. 391).
By "some form of hypnosis'' I think Dr. Bramwell means some stratum of
hypnotic consciousness.

before the writing was produced. Thus when W—s was
told in hypnosis to sum the digits from 1 to 9 and instantly
awakened, planchette wrote down the figures and summed
them up. But when the subject was re-hypnotised he had
no recollection of what he had written, or even of having
written at all.
1
This result, however, was exceptional. As
a rule the subject, on being re-hypnotised, knew what he had
written ; if he had written the answer to any sum given to
him in hypnosis, he knew what figures he had written ; but
there is little evidence in Gurney's papers that the subject
ever remembered the actual steps of the calculation by which
he had arrived at that answer. It does not seem, however,
that Gurney directed his attention specially to this point, as
there is no explicit mention of it in his paper.
I have repeated Gurney's experiments on several subjects,
and while getting results entirely congruous with those obtained
by him, only under exceptional circumstances and by inducing
a very deep stage of hypnosis have I succeeded in reviving
in the mind of the subject the slightest recollection of the
various stages of the mental process employed in the solution
of the problems. If the calculations are made during hypnosis
there is as a rule no difficulty in remembering in subsequent
hypnosis the various steps by which the answer is arrived at.
I gave F. D. a simple sum to do during hypnosis. She
gave me the correct answer. I then woke her. On being
re-hypnotised she remembered doing the sum and also the
various steps in the calculation. I then told her I was going
to give her a little sum to do after she woke up. She was
to divide the figures I would give her by 3, and to tell me
the answer when I asked " What's the answer ?
" Having
explained so much I said :
" The figures you are to divide by
3 are 420, wake up!" She awoke immediately, and I said
at once, " What's the answer ? " She replied, " I don't know
what you mean." " What's the answer ?
" "I don't know,
unless it's 160—that's all I can think off." I re-hypnotised
her and said, " Do you remember doing that sum ?
" " No.
I gave you the answer, 160, but I think that's wrong." "Do
you remember doing the sum, and how you came to make
a mistake ?
" " No. I don't remember." I then induced a

deeper stage of hypnosis by simple verbal suggestion. I
said, " Now sleep deeper—sleep—deep—deep—deep—Do you
remember doing that sum ? " " Yes." " How did you make
a mistake V "I divided the 4 by 3, and then I forgot and
divided the rest by 2."
As the result of many similar experiments I have found
that when subconscious calculations are made during waking-
life in response to suggestions given in hypnosis, the mental
processes involved cannot be recalled in subsequent hypnoses
unless the state of hypnosis induced is of the nature of a
much more profound sleep than that in which the original
suggestions were given. In many instances, no matter what
artifices I might adopt, I failed to revive anything but the
vaguest traces of recollection.
Up to a certain point in his reasoning Dr. Bramwell
seems to assume that the self-consciousness of the hypnotised
subject can exhaust the content of the subliminal mind in
its totality. Yet, at a later stage, by postulating as the real
calculator a third self,
1
separate and distinct from the hypnotic
self, he practically abandons the basis on which his whole
argument so far has rested.
The tendency of some modern psychologists lightly to give
up belief in the unitary character of man's being is greatly
to be deprecated. Neither the records of multiple personality
nor the phenomena of hypnotism warrant the conclusion that
every human being contains within himself an indefinite number
of separate selves. In spontaneous cases of multiple person-
ality the complete dissociation of consciousness manifested in
the different states may justify the use of the word self to
designate each of the alternating phases ; and the same may
be said of some exceptional hypnotic subjects, such as Janet's
Leonie ;"
2
but neither convenience nor customary usage justifies
the application of the term to those isolated manifestations of
subliminal thought which may be exhibited spontaneously, or as
a result of hypnotic suggestion, in healthy persons. It may
be convenient, however, in investigating such operations of
the subliminal part of the mind as are manifested in connection
with the hypnotic state, to conceive subconsciousness as a

part of the stream of consciousness as a whole, but flowing
at different depths below the surface known to us by intro-
spection in the waking state. Or, to change the metaphor,
we may regard it as we do those regions of the earth's crust
which lie below the surface of every-day observation. The
danger of such metaphors is obvious, but it is probably less
misleading to speak of the hypnotic stratum of consciousness
than of the hypnotic self. This is especially so if by using
the term hypnotic self we imply that it is co-extensive with
the subliminal self; for there is abundant evidence, derived
from various sources, that the region of mental life laid bare-
at any one time by the induction of hypnosis is but a
fraction of the subliminal, just as the supraliminal is but a
fraction of mental life in its totality.
We must not then suppose that hypnotisation will enable
us to bring to the surface the memory of all subliminal
mentation which may go on during waking life. The memory
test in regard to mental processes supposed to be carried on
at the hypnotic level, has positive but not negative validity
;
and even if a want of recollection during hypnosis of the
events of previous hypnoses did not sometimes occur, we could
not deny the possibility of a subconscious train of thought,
—
even if this were started by a suggestion given during hypnosis,
—of which no recollection can be aroused by re-hypnotisation.
So far as I can find, writers on hypnotism have not dealt
explicitly with this question. Much of the evidence to be
found in Gurney's papers, and that which I have met with
in my own investigations, points to a very curious conclusion
with regard to the elements of subconscious thinking that can
be recalled in the hypnotic state. Sensory impressions that
have been subliminally perceived are as a rule remembered
in hypnosis ; and with the memory of the impression comes
a memory of the thought accompanying or occasioned by it.
Bodily acts, such as writing or speaking, originating subliminally ;
are also, as a rule, remembered in hypnosis ; and along with
the recollection of the written or spoken words there comes
of course a knowledge of their meaning ; and there may be
thus a simulation of remembrance of the content of a sub-
conscious thought. When a thought has not been the
immediate result of a subliminally perceived sensory impression.
liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 41
or has not been externalised in any motor act, a memory of
it may sometimes be found in hypnosis if the thought is
the conclusion of a subconscious train of reasoning, or the
answer to a problem which has been solved subliminally.
Generalisation in regard to the peculiarities of hypnotic
and post-hypnotic states is nearly always a mistake ; and I
do not for a moment deny that in exceptional circumstances
memory of a much wider range of subliminal thought than
that which I have indicated may be found during hypnosis
;
but in the ordinary somnambule it is, I think, very difficult
to find any indisputable evidence of memory of a subconscious
thought which cannot be included in one of the categories I
have named.
As I have said, acts originating subliminally are remembered,
and with the remembrance of the act comes also a remembrance
of the thought which immediately prompted it. But if this
act is the result of a subconscious train of reasoning or of
calculation, there may be, and in my own experiments I have
found that there generally is, no recollection of the various
antecedent stages of thought which have led up to it. The
evidence as to these unremembered things is mainly negative ;
for example, the difficulty in finding any hypnotic memory
of the actual doing of subliminal calculations. As to remem-
bered things there is, of course, plenty of evidence. If a
post-hypnotic act is to be performed when the operator coughs
for the fifth time, the subliminal perception of the coughs is
remembered in hypnosis ; and if the subject be hypnotised
after the fourth cough he will sometimes give proof of being
in an attitude of expectancy for the final signal. There is
abundant evidence that acts originating subliminally are
remembered—all suggested post-hypnotic acts for example.
Even if the act in question had not been distinctly specified
when the suggestion was given, but was the result of a certain
amount of spontaneity and choice, or of even more elaborate
mental processes, on the part of the secondary consciousness,
the doing of it can, as a rule, be recollected during hypnosis.
That the results of subliminal calculation may sometimes be
remembered in hypnosis was shown in the series of experi-
ments with F. D. ; but that they sometimes may not be
remembered is equally clear from Dr. Bramwell's observations.
42 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
The difficulty in finding any memory of the continuous
thinking which we know can go on subliminally would seem
to be especially great if the train of thought necessitates
some concentration of subliminal attention, as in the calcula-
tions required in the time-experiments recorded by Delboeuf,
Dr. Bramwell, and myself ; and I know no better description
of the nature of the mental state in which such calculations
are presumably made than that given to me by F. D., in
hypnosis, when she said that she " went into such a very
deep sleep when doing them that she could not remember
anything about the actual calculations afterwards."
This deepening of the sleep, which I believe actually takes
place—a " sleep " of the hypnotic stratum of consciousness
—
may be merely a concentration of attention on the problem
to be solved. The amount of attention which can be brought
to bear is at all times limited ; and even during waking
life, if the attention becomes completely absorbed by some
experience, the marginal elements in the conscious field may
become so wholly submerged that only at the end of the
experience do we " come to ourselves " and take up the thread
of our life in relation to the external world. So, when sub-
conscious attention is concentrated on the solution of an
arithmetical problem given in hypnosis, absorption in the
problem becomes so complete that only when the solution has
been attained does the consciousness of the hypnotic stratum
" come to itself," and enter into relation with those subconscious
thoughts which form the memory-continuum of the hypnotic
state.
In the case of my own subject, F. D., the period of natural
sleep seemed to be the time chosen for the working out of
the calculations. And it is reasonable to suppose that the
subliminal is seldom so completely segregated from the supra-
liminal consciousness as not to be to some extent disturbed
in its operations by the experiences of waking life. But when
the repose of natural sleep supervenes we can imagine the
subconscious mind at the hypnotic level settling down to the
solution of its task, becoming absorbed in its work, and " coming
to itself " when the problem has been solved. Again I appeal
to the information given by the subject in hypnosis ;
F. D. said
that she sometimes remembered thinking in her sleep of the
Liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 43
questions and the answers, but she denied all knowledge of
having made any calculations.
The second point which Dr. Brainwell thinks demands an
explanation is " the fact that the suggestions not only involved
feats of arithmetical calculations and memory far beyond the
subjects' normal powers, but also in some cases beyond their
ordinary hypnotic ones." 1
I have already referred to the calculations made by Delboeuf's
subjects, and I have pointed out the importance of the amount of
time which is at the disposal of the subconscious intelligence
for the working out of the problems. In regard to Dr. Bram-
well's experiments and my own, the first thing which must
be taken into consideration is the comparative simplicity of
the earlier problems and their gradual increase in difficulty
-as time went on. We must not undervalue the facility in
calculation which practice brings, and whatever method of
reducing minutes to hours and days a subject may adopt,
there seems little doubt that familiarity with certain equiva-
lents of minutes in days and hours must soon become established,
and be utilised in the solution of what at first sight may appear
very complex arithmetical problems.
I find that the apparently clumsy plan adopted by F. D.
of making the number of minutes in a day her basis of calcula-
tion is singularly well adapted for the solution of such problems
;
for just as in the earlier experiments the number of minutes
in one, two, or three days, became fixed in the mind, so in
the later and more difficult ones simple multiples of 1440
showed at once the number of days, plus or minus some
number of minutes less than 1440, in any given experiment.
For example, after a little experience of problems of this
description, one soon comes to know and to remember that
10,080 is the number of minutes in a week. Given this
knowledge it will be seen that the first problem correctly
solved in hypnosis by Miss D. (Dr. Bramwell's Exp. 26)
2
was
a very simple one indeed. At 3 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 12th,
a suggestion was given to be fulfilled in 10,115 minutes. The
only mental arithmetic necessary is to subtract 80 from 115.
The suggestion is then at once known to be due in a week plus
35 minutes, or "next Wednesday at 25 minutes to 4 p.m."
1

44 T. W. Mitchell, M.R [part
Looked at in the same way, many of the other suggestions
which at first sight seem to necessitate considerable powers
of mental arithmetic, are rendered very simple. Thus in Dr.
Bramwell's Exp. 39 —in 20,180 minutes from 3.30 p.m.—all
that is necessary is to recognise that 10,080 x 2 = 20,160,
and the date at which the suggestion falls clue is immediately
seen to be 3.50 p.m. a fortnight hence. Practically all the
problems solved correctly by Miss D. in hypnosis were of a
similarly simple kind ; and of the few to which I got correct
answers from my subject, F. D., the same thing holds good.
In his statement of the point demanding explanation in
regard to the calculations, Dr. Bramwell assumes that arith-
metical powers are always greater during hypnosis than in
waking life. The evidence in favour of this belief is by no
means unequivocal. We have seen that in Delboeufs subject
J. there was during hypnosis apparently little improvement
in her calculating powers ; and my own experience with most
of my somnambules is quite in accord witli this result. On
twenty-four occasions Dr. Bramwell's subject, Miss D., was
asked, immediately after the suggestions were given, and before
the termination of hypnosis, to calculate when the suggested
act fell due. In the first nine instances she was wrong, and
in the remaining fifteen she was right in eleven and wrong
in four. " As the experiments advanced, not only the fre-
quency, but also the extent, of Miss D.'s errors in calculation
decreased, and the answers were given much more rapidly.
Sometimes the correct replies were almost instantaneous, and
in these instances no conscious calculation could be traced." 1
Here, again, we have to note the effects of practice in facilitating
the mental operations necessary in such calculations. There
is really nothing very wonderful in the fact that an intelligence
which has been for several weeks engaged in solving problems
such as were given to Miss D. in hypnosis, should at last
succeed in telling, almost immediately, when an act to be
performed at the end of 10,050 minutes falls due. Dr. Bram-
well says that in the waking state Miss D. failed in doing-
mental calculations unless the sums were extremely simple.
But she similarly failed, to begin with, in the hypnotic state.
Had a parallel series of problems been given to Miss D. in the

waking state from the beginning, or even from the 8th of
January, when she was first asked to make calculations during
hypnosis, there can be little doubt that by February 5 th,
when she first succeeded in giving a correct answer in hypnosis,
she would have been able to solve the same problem as readily
in the waking state. But no such training of the waking
intelligence having taken place, the hypnotic intelligence was
by February 5th, if not the better calculator, at least in
possession of certain data, useful in the particular kind of
calculations required, of which the waking intelligence was
quite ignorant.
The most curious detail of these problems solved in hypnosis,
and one which I have frequently verified in my own experi-
ments, is that when correct answers were given immediately,
" no conscious calculation could be traced." I presume that
by this phrase Dr. Bramwell means that the subject herself
was not conscious of making any calculation. But we must
remember how difficult introspection is to an untrained mind ;
and the difference between a conclusion arrived at by a short
calculation and one which depends immediately on a know-
ledge of certain facts, is sometimes not quite obvious, even to
a trained observer. I know that there are 365 days in a
year. If I am asked how many days there are from the 1st
of January, 1907, to the 2nd of January, 1908, and I answer
immediately 366, have I made a calculation? Or am I merely
stating a fact which is as well known to me as that there are
seven days in a week ? So if Miss D., in hypnosis, knew that
there are 10,080 minutes in a week, would it be necessary
for her to make any calculation to tell when an act suggested
to be done in 10,090 minutes fell due?
As I have already indicated, a memory of the results of
subconscious calculations made in response to suggestions given
in hypnosis becomes a possession of the hypnotic stratum of
consciousness. Thus when F. D. worked out on paper, during
hypnosis, the calculation in experiment No. 13, she put down
1440 and multiplied it by 10. She knew that 1440 is the
number of minutes in a day, and thought that "any one would
know that." This knowledge was, no doubt, the result of a
subconscious calculation which she had forgotten.
O
In my own experiments I gave my subjects very few
46 T. W. Mitchell, M.I). [part
opportunities of making calculations in hypnosis. I rather
directed my attention to the investigation of the subconscious
calculations which are made after hypnosis has terminated. I
have found little evidence that calculation in hypnosis is, as a
rule, appreciably more rapid or more accurate than in the
waking state, except in so far as such data as I have indicated,
resulting from training during hypnosis or from subconscious
calculation in post-hypnosis, may become a possession of the
hypnotic stratum of consciousness, and thereby facilitate the
solution of such problems during the hypnotic state. With
regard to subconscious calculations performed after hypnosis is
terminated, the investigation is more difficult, and the con-
clusions to be arrived at more doubtful. In some of Gurney's
experiments there seems to have been a more rapid calculation
than was possible in the waking state. In my own experi-
ments I have found little evidence that mental calculations
can be performed subconsciously more quickly than they can
be in hypnosis or in ordinary waking life. On the contrary,
I have found, in some cases at least, that if the waking
consciousness is actively engaged, a length of time as great or
greater than would be required for the solution of the problem
in ordinary waking, or in hypnosis, is necessary for the sub-
conscious calculation. On the other hand, there is evidence
to show that problems, the mental solution of which would
seem to be beyond the powers of the waking or of the hypnotic
consciousness may be correctly solved under favourable circum-
stances, such as during natural sleep, as the result of a purely
subconscious calculation.
Although I am inclined to ascribe most importance to the
uninterrupted concentration of attention which may be possible
at the hypnotic level, and to the length of time which is
available by the subconscious intelligence for making the cal-
culations, still, there may be, in some instances, both in
hypnosis and in post-hypnosis, a facilitation of mental operations
at the hypnotic level which is impossible in supraliminal
thouoht. Such a facilitation of mental calculations would arise
if the subject were able to visualise the figures employed, so
that they had for him the reality and permanence which
suggested visual hallucinations have for many somnambules.
We know from the work of Charcot, Gilbert Ballet, and
LIV.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 47
Sir Francis Galton, that individuals vary very much as to the
nature of the sensory images which they most habitually use
as their counters of thought. Some people, when thinking of
things or events, depend almost entirely on their visual
memory. Some, on the other hand, rely greatly on auditory
or kinaesthetic representations. Even the thinking that is
done in words is subject to similar variations, and there are
some people whose most abstract thought is accompanied by a
train of visual verbal imagery. With regard to words, how-
ever, this is undoubtedly exceptional ; and notwithstanding
the opinion of Bain and Strieker, that motor representations
form the material of our recollection in the use of words, I
think there is little doubt that the view put forward in this
country by Dr. Charlton Bastian, and in France by Victor Egger,
which gives pre-eminence to auditory representations, is true for
the great majority of people who habitually think in words.
But with regard to the thought-symbols of arithmetic, it is
quite different. Here visual representation is the rule ; and
it will, I think, be found that skill in mental arithmetic is
almost always accompanied by unusual powers of visualisation.
So far as my own experiments go, I have found that if a
somnambule is a good visucl he will, other things being equal,
be more expert at mental arithmetic during hypnosis than one
who is not. He will also, I think, show increased capacity,
or at least will solve the problems more rapidly during hypnosis
than in the waking state. I have also found some indications
that he will perform calculations subconsciously in post-hypnosis
more rapidly, but on this point the evidence is not very
conclusive.
Although individuals vary greatly in their powers of visual-
isation, very few people in the waking state can visualise
sufficiently well to enable them to keep steadily before the
mind all the figures in a sum of any considerable length ; but
if a somnambule is visuel in the normal state, it is quite
possible that during hypnosis, or in the working of the hypnotic
stratum of consciousness at other times, such an increase of
faculty may readily take place. If this possibility be accepted,
and if allowance be made for hypnotic training of the calcu-
lating faculty, for increased power of attention at the hypnotic
level of consciousness, and for the length of time at the
48 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
disposal of the subconscious intelligence in arriving at a correct
solution of the more difficult problems, the contention that
the solution of these problems involved feats of arithmetical
calculation beyond the normal powers of the subjects loses
much of its force. We should rather be inclined to expect
that somnambules who have undergone some training in sub-
conscious calculation, might be able to perform subconsciously
problems as difficult as any that they could do in the waking-
state with the help of pencil and paper.
I have made only one or two experiments of this nature.
On one occasion I told F. D., during hypnosis, to write down
in my presence the next time I called to see her, the number
of halfpennies in £36 17s. Hid. I saw her two days later,
and while awake and talking to me she wrote down the
correct answer. Awake, she did not know what the figures
meant, or why she had written them. In hypnosis she remem-
bered the suggestion, and knew that what she had written
was the answer. She did not know when she had solved
the problem, and had no recollection of having made any
calculation. On another occasion I asked her, while awake,
if she knew how many yards are in a mile. She said she
did not. In hypnosis I told her to write down, in my presence,
when I called to see her a<min, the number of feet in two
and a half miles. She said she was sure she could not do
this. The correct answer was written down in my presence
five clays later.
Although the solution of the more difficult problems
occurring in the time-experiments would seem to necessitate
some such facilitation of the mental calculations as I have
suggested, there is not, in the instances recorded up to the
present, anything to warrant the belief that the subconscious
powers of the subjects are in this respect any greater than
might be expected from their standard of education ; and were
these the only examples of subconscious calculations on record
we might be content with some such explanation as I have
suggested. But the powers of subconscious calculation
exhibited by calculating prodigies such as Oauss or Dase
should deter us from being too sure that the solution of the
comparatively simple problems given to hypnotic somnambules
may not be the work of some truly supernormal faculty the
Liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 49
mere suspicion of whose existence would be a heresy for
orthodox science.
The third point which Dr. Bramwell thinks needs to be
taken into consideration when trying to explain the results of
his own experiments is the difference in the nature of the
time-appreciation required in Gurney's cases and in those
cited by himself. He says
:
1 " There is a marked difference
between the recognition of a particular clay on its arrival, and
the last minute in such a series as 40,845. . . . Granting
that some intelligence worked out the arithmetical portion and
determined that the suggestion fell due, for example, at
3.25 p.m. a fortnight later, the determination of the arrival
of that particular moment differs widely from the recognition
of the dawning of a given day."
Now I venture to think that unless special precautions are
taken to keep the subject away from all ordinary means of
knowing the time, there is very little difference indeed between
the two kinds of experiment. Dr. Bramwell says that in
Gurney's experiments the secondary intelligence would have
no difficulty in recognising the terminal clay because " the
varying impressions from the external world, which tell us that
a new day has dawned, would be received as freely by the
secondary as by the primary consciousness." 2
But in the
same way the visual or auditory impressions which give
information of the time of day to the primary consciousness
will be equally open to the secondary consciousness ; and the
secondary consciousness will be on the look-out for such
information even when the primary consciousness is so engaged
as apparently to preclude all time watching.
The difficulty of preventing such access of subliminal know-
ledge will be especially great when the experiments are carried
on in towns ; for then, unless special precautions are taken, it is
almost impossible to keep the subject out of reach of visual or
auditory indications of the passage of time. Clock-dials assail
the eye at every step, and church bells chime the quarters all
through the clay and night ; and we must not neglect the
possibilities of the information that may be so obtained by a
watchful subconsciousness. In this connection we must also
bear in mind the possibility that subconscious perception may

D
50 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
have normally the immensely extended range which perception
in hypnosis attains under suggestion. If such be the case, the
difficulty of assuring ourselves, even when apparently stringent
precautions are taken, that the subconscious mind does not
receive its information through the ordinary sensory channels
is greatly increased. When no such precautions are taken it
seems obvious that under ordinary circumstances there is
little difference in the nature of the time-watching involved,
whether the suggested act is to be fulfilled on " the 39th
day from this," or at "3.25 p.m. a fortnight later." But if,
as Dr. Bramwell says, 1 " in some instances Miss D. was in
a darkened room for several hours before the suocrestion was
executed, and absolutely without any of the ordinary methods
of determining the time, even if she knew what o'clock it
was when she entered the room, how could she determine
when it was 3.25?" Now, I think we may take it for
granted that whether " she " knew the time or not when she
entered the room, her subconscious intelligence knew—if, in
order to fulfil the suggestion correctly, it was necessary for it
to know. So that the original problem of recognising the
arrival of the terminal minute of 40,845 minutes becomes
reduced to that of appreciating the passage of time for
3 hours and 25 minutes, or of knowing when it was
3.25 p.m. If we can exclude the possibility which I have
suggested that even in the darkened room her subconscious
mind was not " absolutely without any of the ordinary
methods of determining the time," then we have arrived at
what I consider to be the ultimate problem demanding
explanation in all these experiments on the appreciation of
time by somnambules.
My own observations carried on in the quiet of the
country are to some extent not open to the same criticism
as are those of observers working in more populous districts.
F. D. lives in a cottage far removed from church bells, and
the only clock in the house is the kitchen clock, which does
not strike the hours. She possesses a watch which she keeps
wound up ; but she scarcely ever wears it when she is at
home. It generally lies on her dressing-table all day and all
night. Her opportunities of obtaining subliminal information

Li v.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 51
of the " time of day " through ordinary sensory channels are
thus very restricted; and experiments with her afford better
evidence of true time-appreciation than those with subjects
whose surroundings give more opportunities for subliminal
perception of such ordinary indications of the passage of time
as I have referred to.
What I mean by true time- appreciation is the power of
marking the passage of time without any guidance, either supra-
liminal or subliminal, which can by any possibility be referred
to changes going on in the external world. If the conditions
necessary for testing this power can ever be arranged, it is
evident that they can be maintained for only comparatively
short periods. We cannot expect to find subjects who are
willing to be confined in a dark room for any length of time,
or to have the usual routine of their lives disturbed for the
sake of our experiments ; and even if such subjects could be
found, there are probably few competent observers who could
spare the time necessary for making exact observations.
The nearest approach to evidence of a true time-watching
taking place over a longer interval than a few hours is to be
found in connection with prolonged hypnotic sleep. I lately
had occasion to recommend to Mrs. C. a sleep of forty-eight
hours, with intervals for meals. I saw her on a Tuesday, and
she told me that she could spare the necessary time after 3
o'clock the next day. I was going away from home on the
Wednesday, so I gave her the necessary instructions during
hypnosis on the Tuesday. I said :
" To-morrow at 3 o'clock
you will go to sleep. You will sleep till 9 o'clock and then
wake up and have some supper. You will then go to sleep,
and sleep till 8 o'clock next morning. You will then wake
up and have breakfast. After breakfast you will go to sleep,
and you will sleep till 1 o'clock," and so on. I saw her on
Thursday and found that my instructions had been followed out.
Each time she had awakened she had remained awake for
half-an-hour exactly, and had then fallen asleep again. This
exact half-hour interval must have been the result of an auto-
suggestion ; for I had not given any definite instructions as to
how long she was to remain awake. On the Friday I called
to see her in the forenoon and found her sleeping peacefully.
I awoke her and asked her if she knew what day it was.
52 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
She said it was Friday. She showed some hesitation as to
whether it was forenoon or afternoon, but finally said it was
forenoon. She was quite unable, however, to tell what the
time was. She was unwilling even to guess, for she maintained
that she had no idea what it might be. I said to her, " Sleep.
What is the exact time?" She replied at once, "11.20." I
took out my watch and found that her answer was correct.
There was no clock in the room. I did not know what the
exact time was until I looked at my watch.
In this case there seems to have been a true appreciation
of the passage of time throughout the whole period of sleep.
The watching of the time was done by the hypnotic conscious-
ness ; and the knowledge of the time of day so obtained was
in the possession of the hypnotic consciousness alone.
Apart from such observations as may be made in connection
with prolonged hypnotic sleep, I greatly regret that I have
never been able to spare the time necessary to test my subjects'
powers of true time-appreciation over a longer period than
half-an-hour.
I have, however, made a large number of observations within
the limited time at my disposal, and these are sufficient to
convince me that in the true time-appreciation of somnambules
we have to deal with a power which in the present state of
knowledge can only be described as supernormal.
Gurney made many observations on his subjects in regard
to their power of appreciating the passage of short periods of
time. He has recorded a number of instances in which an
act suggested in hypnosis has been performed more or less
punctually at the end of a given number - of minutes, the
subject having been under observation during the whole
course of the experiment. He also utilised automatic writing
with planchette to obtain evidence of the subconscious time-
watching that can go on during the waking state. The
subject, having been taught how to write with planchette,
was told in hypnosis to perform some act in a given number
of minutes, and that he would be required at some time
before then to write the number of minutes that had passed.
Thus one of his subjects "was told on March 23rd that a
quarter of an hour after his next arrival he was to open and
shut the door of the room, and to note the course of time
LIV.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 53
as usual. The next evening he arrived at 7.6 \. He was
set to the planchette at 7.19. The writing, produced at
once, was 13 min. and 2 more. At 7.22 he rose, walked
across the room, opened and shut the door, and returned
to his seat. Here the reckoning was not more than half a
minute out."
1
I have made a great many observations more or less on
the lines of Gurney's experiments ; but I have thought it
best to make the suggested act as simple as possible. It is
important in testing for accuracy in time-watching that the
act to be performed should be one to which the subject has
no objection whatsoever, so that when it is about to be
performed in the waking state there may be no resistance
from the supraliminal consciousness to be overcome. This
ensures its fulfilment at the moment of the subliminal invasion.
It is also well that the act should be one which can be
performed rapidly, so that as little time as possible may
elapse between its beginning and its end. The suggestion
given in most of my experiments was that at the end of
so many minutes the subject should raise her right or her
left hand above her head. She was told to do it rapidly as
soon as the idea of doing so arose in her mind. Sometimes
two or three suggestions were given together, the acts to be
performed at the end of different time intervals. In obtaining
automatic writing in these experiments, instead of using
planchette, I always got the subject to write with a pencil.
A few examples will sufficiently illustrate the nature of these
experiments.
I suggested to F. ~D. in hypnosis, without telling her the
time, that in eleven minutes exactly she would raise her
right arm. She was then awakened, and she raised her arm
at the end of ten minutes. On another occasion she was
told in hypnosis that her right arm would go up in four
minutes. This suggestion was fulfilled in hypnosis about ten
seconds too soon. She was then told that her arm would
come down in three minutes. This was fulfilled in the
waking state in three minutes exactly. When she was
asked why her arm came down, she said it got so heavy
that she could not keep it up any longer.
iGurney, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. IV., p. 309.
54 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
On another occasion, at 3.50 p.m., I told her in hypnosis
to put her left arm up in fifteen minutes. At 3.56 I told
her to put her right arm up in nine minutes. Soon afterwards
she was awakened. Her left arm went up at 4.4 (one
minute too soon). A minute afterwards she laughed and
said her right arm wanted to go up too. She raised it at
4.5 exactly (right).
I have carried out similar observations on several
somnambules with almost identical results. Some subjects,
it is true, seem to be more accurate in their estimation
of these short time-intervals than others ; but in every
case where I have made a series of observations I have
found the same tendency to slight errors, although on
the whole a remarkable accuracy in time estimation was
exhibited.
The mean error varies with different subjects. In a series
of thirty-one observations on F. D. in the estimation of periods
varying from one to fifteen minutes, the mean error was
1'009 minutes. In fifteen observations on Mrs. C, with
periods varying from two to ten minutes the mean error was
'78 minutes. In a series of sixty observations on various
subjects with periods varying from one minute to half an
hour, the mean error was -
89 minutes.
One very curious result to be noted in these experiments
is the apparent limitation of the amount of error, no matter
what the suggested time-interval may be. An error of one
minute seems as likely to be made when the suggestion is
for fifteen minutes as when it is for three minutes. We
might have supposed that a subject who has just performed
at the end of two minutes an act suggested to be performed
in three minutes, would be likely to perform in ten minutes
an act suggested to be performed in fifteen minutes. But
it is not so. The most likely time for the fifteen minute
suggestion to be fulfilled is in fourteen, fifteen or sixteen
minutes. The maximum error met with was one of six
minutes in a time estimation of eighteen minutes ; but this
occurred in one of a complicated series in which four
suggestions were running concurrently. In the great majority
of cases, in the estimation of periods up to half an hour, the
maximum error was not more than one or two minutes. In
Li v.] The Appreciation of Time by Sornnambules. 55
thirty per cent, of the trials on all subjects, the time-interval
was accurately determined.
In experiments of this description it would seem that
there is an actual watching of the minutes as they pass, just
as in Gurney's original experiments there was a watching
of the days. But since minutes are purely artificial divisions
of time and have not for us the concrete character which
days have, the way in which this watching is done needs
some explanation. It is comparatively easy to understand
how a subconscious intelligence may watch the passage of
days and count them as they pass ; but it is by no means
easy to understand how this same intelligence, unaided by
any artificial mechanism such as a clock, can accurately
subdivide " time's continuous flow " into periods which corre-
spond to a given number of minutes.
We know nothing of time apart from sensible experience.
Time as a psychological datum is but a quality of our
sensations and our feelings. Empty time is an abstraction
of the metaphysician, and except in a relative sense is
unknown to the psychologist : time perceived is always filled.
We perceive a sensible present which has duration. Pre-
sentations increasing in complexity give us a feeling of a
future which is coming towards us ;
presentations diminishing
in complexity give us a feeling of a past which is receding
behind us ; and the relatively unchanging complexity of the
" now " of experience gives us a feeling of " the specious
present " which forms our sole distinct intuition of time.
1
All cognition of time apart from the directly experienced
" now " is conceptual and has to be represented symbolically.
But judged by a " standard time," the specious present of
different individuals seems to vary in its duration ; and in
any particular individual this duration seems to vary at
different times. The symbolic conception of a period of time
attained by summing up the " nows " of so-called empty time,
or by counting the sensory changes experienced in filled time,
would thus lack all utility in thought and all validity in
practice were there not some changes, referable to the
external world and habitually experienced by all human
beings, which may be utilised as a standard of measurement.
1
Cf. H. R. Marshall: "The Time Quality," Mind, Jan. 1907, p. 1.
56 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
For practical purposes the mean solar day is so used, and
by mechanical contrivances this period of time is subdivided
into hours, minutes, and seconds. But until clocks are con-
structed these subdivisions of time are not given in experience,
and there is no necessary correlation between the " now
"
of experience and the second of the mean solar day.
Hours, minutes, and seconds are thus artificial devices for
measuring the number of sensory changes experienced in
succession. The passage of five, ten, or twenty minutes has
no meaning apart from such sensory changes ; for awareness
of change is a necessary condition of the perception of
time.
The manifestations of consciousness as we know it empirically
are conditioned by its cerebral substratum, and the number of
successive impressions that can be apperceived in a given
time is limited by the rate at which certain physico-chemical
changes can take place in nervous tissue. If consciousness
were independent of any material substratum we have no
reason to suppose that any such limitation would obtain in
regard to the number of presentations or representations that
would be possible in a given time. For such a consciousness
the measure of time would be altered, and the phenomenal
world would be transformed.
Certain philosophers believe that the normal self-consciousness
does not exhaust its object—the Ego, and that there is in
man besides the empirical consciousness with its physiological
measure of time, also a transcendental consciousness with
another measure of time peculiar to itself. This transcendental
consciousness is supposed to emerge when the empirical is
set to rest, and its measure of time is said to be a
characteristic incident of dreams. The condensation of re-
presentations in certain dreams is accounted for by supposing
that the dream-consciousness is not fettered by any physical
substratum, and that its measure of time is therefore not
physiological but transcendental. A consciousness with such
a measure of time in its highest degree would see time, as
Luther said, not lengthwise but crosswise ; all would be in
a heap before it.
I refer to these matters merely in order to point out that
when we meet with some form of consciousness which can
Liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 57
accurately determine the passage of five, ten, or twenty
minutes without any apparent guidance through the ordinary
channels of sense, however much we may feel tempted to
postulate some transcendental faculty in explanation of the
phenomenon, we may rest assured that we are dealing with
a consciousness whose mode of cognising time differs not
at all from that of the consciousness which we know
empirically.
In seeking an explanation of the time-appreciation of
somnambules we seem bound to look to the methods used
when similar judgments are made by the ordinary waking
consciousness. If in the waking state we are denied all
ordinary means of marking the passage of time we can still
make judgments, less or more accurate, as to the length
of any given interval. If we sit with our eyes closed and
try to determine when five minutes have elapsed, we may
arrive at a very close approximation to the proper interval
if we set ourselves deliberately to count. We have ingrained
within us a sense of rhythm, based upon memories of certain
sensory experiences, which enables us to revive fairly accurately
the time-intervals in the swing of a second pendulum. By
summing up three hundred such imaginary pendulum beats
we may, if we keep the rhythm true, judge very accurately
when five minutes have elapsed. Even if our minds are
occupied in some other way and we do not attempt to
count, we may still make a guess as to when the time is
up. Such guesses, however, are very liable to gross error,
and it seems evident that the accurate appreciation of time-
intervals by somnambules cannot be accounted for on any
hypothesis of mere guessing.
Apart from rhythmic counting, when cut off from all changing
sensory impressions derived from the outer world, we seem
to have no faculty for judging accurately of the passage of
time. Yet a somnambule in the hypnotic trance, deprived of
all such sense-impressions, and, so far as his hypnotic conscious-
ness is aware, not deliberately counting or making any effort
to note the passage of time, makes such judgments with an
accuracy which precludes the possibility that they are the
result of mere guessing. If we believe that the accurate time-
estimates of somnambules during the trance are the result of
58 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part
some form of conscious counting, the want of knowledge during
hypnosis as to how it is done forces us to suppose that the
process must be carried on below the threshold of hypnotic
consciousness, or by some fragmentary portion of this conscious-
ness temporarily dissociated from the hypnotic stratum as a
whole ; and a similar supposition must be made with reference
to the equally accurate time-appreciation which takes place
subconsciously, in response to suggestion, during the waking
state. Further, if such a form of subconscious counting takes
place, it is not necessary to suppose that it is a counting of
some imaginary rhythm. For it seems probable that the lower
strata of consciousness can take cognisance of various organic
processes which are, or may be, unperceived or generally
unattended to by the waking self. And if a correlation has
been subconsciously established between such phases of organic
life and our artificial divisions of time, the subconscious watcher
is provided with an objective time-measurer which is liable
to only slight variations of regularity. Such variations as
normally take place in the rate of the heart-beat or of respira-
tory movement, are just such as would account for the
inaccuracies exhibited by somnambules in their estimates of
short periods. In longer periods of true time-watching the
organic rhythm will usually average its normal rate, and con-
sequently the amount of error in the time-estimates of the
subject is not likely to be greater for half an hour than for
five minutes.
While some such explanation seems necessary to account
for the accurate appreciation of short time-intervals, there is
another possibility which must be taken into consideration in
regard to the fulfilment of post-hypnotic acts at a particular
moment which has been previously determined by subconscious
calculation. That possibility is that these somnambules may
have the power, exhibited sometimes by individuals who have
never been hypnotised, of knowing the time of day, intuitively as
it were, without any conscious or subconscious perception of
such sensory impressions as normally give us this information.
I have frequently tested F. D. on this point, and have found
her to be extremely accurate in her estimates. And it is a
curious fact that this power, never manifested by her previously,
became greatly developed during the course of the experiments
;
liv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 59
so that she often astonished her friends by her accurate telling of
the time under circumstances which seemed to preclude such
knowledge as she showed. When tested during hypnosis she
was almost invariably absolutely correct when a suggestion of
clairvoyance with regard to the kitchen clock was given. The
following extract from my notes will serve as an example.
On April 18th, 1906, I asked her in the waking state
what time she thought it was. She said 11.30. I told her I
thought she was rather slow. In hypnosis she said she thought
it was 11.40. I then suggested that she should see the kitchen
clock and tell the exact time by it. She said she could not
see it. I told her to sleep deeply and she would see it clearly.
" Can you see it ?
" " Yes." " Well, what time is it ?
"
"About 12 o'clock." "Tell me more exactly." "I can't
see the hands properly." " Look steadily and you will see.
What is it ?
" " Five minutes to twelve." I then woke
her up, and went into the kitchen with her and looked at
the clock. It was a very small American clock, about three
inches high. The hands pointed to four minutes to twelve.
I do not pretend that this was really clairvoyance. The
few attempts I have made in other directions to test this power,
so firmly believed in by the early mesmerists, have been almost
entirely negative. Yet when confronted by such difficulties as
meet us in trying to explain the peculiar gifts so commonly
exhibited by hypnotic somnambules, or the less common
manifestation of similar powers by persons who have never
been hypnotised, we are bound to neglect no evidence, which
has been testified to by credible and careful observers, that
may possibly throw any light, however dim, upon these obscure
regions of psychological research. And whether we hold fast
to the accepted conclusions of orthodox science, or allow our-
selves to stray into the vaguer regions of transcendental
speculation, in the present state of knowledge the difficulties
to be met with in connection with the appreciation of time by
somnambules are of such a nature as inevitably to entail,
on any hypothesis, a considerable residuum of unexplained
phenomena.

EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.
By Clarissa Miles and Hermione Ramsden.
The first series of these experiments, which were carried on
during October and November, 1905, were reported in the
Journal S.P.R, for March, 1906. The second series were
described at a meeting of the Society on March 25th, 1907.
Miss Miles writes in regard to them :
Shortly after I began these experiments with Miss Ramsden, I
told Professor Barrett about them, and I have profited largely by
his advice in carrying them on, and especially in the method of
recording them.
I made Professor Barrett's acquaintance a few years ago, in con-
sequence of some articles about my experiments in dowsing which
were published in Country Life and other periodicals, giving an
account of various places where I had found water. Since then I have
tried a number of experiments for him,—especially in dowsing and
in various phases of clairvoyance, such as finding hidden coins, etc.,
—
and have learnt from him to make them of use to outsiders by
recording them fully at the time and obtaining on the spot whatever
confirmatory testimony was available. In fact, whatever scientific value
attaches to the results of all my experiments is, I feel, entirety owing
to his constant help and guidance. In the second series Miss Ramsden
sent copies of many of the postcards recording her impressions to
Professor Barrett at the same time as to me, so as to make the
evidence as complete as possible.
FIRST SERIES.
Miss Ramsden having met with a certain amount of success
in experiments in thought-transference with two other friends
of hers, asked Miss Miles to try a systematic series with her.
liv.] Experiments in Thought-Transference. 61
It was then arranged that Miss Miles, living at 59 Egerton
Gardens, London, S.W., should play the part of agent, while
Miss Eamsden, at her home, Bulstrode, Gerrard's Cross,
Buckinghamshire (about 20 miles from London), acted as
percipient, the times of the experiments being fixed by pre-
arrangement.
Miss Miles noted at the time of each experiment, in a
book kept for the purpose, the idea or image which she
wished to convey, while Miss Eamsden wrote down each day
the impressions that had come into her mind, and sent the
record to Miss Miles before knowing what she had attempted
on her side. Miss Miles then pasted this record into her
book opposite her own notes, and in some cases added a
further note explanatory of her circumstances at the time to
which it will be seen that Miss Bamsden's impressions often
corresponded. Whenever it was possible, Miss Miles obtained
confirmatory evidence from other persons as to the circum-
stances that had not been noted at the time, and the corro-
boration of these persons was written in her book and is
printed below. All the original records of these experiments
were submitted to the Editor.
In the printed account, we give in the case of each experi-
ment («) the note made at the time by the agent, Miss
Miles ;
(b) the note made at the time by the percipient, Miss
Eamsden ;
(c) the subsequent comments, if any, made by Miss
Miles ;
(d) the corroborations, if any, of Miss Miles's friends
;

Any omissions in the printed copy of the records are
indicated in the usual manner by omission marks. . . .
Almost all the record is printed in full, so that the reader
may be able to judge of the proportions of failure and
success. The names of the persons concerned are given,
except in the case of Experiment IX.
Experiment I.
(a) October 18th, 1905. 7 p.m.
SPHINX.
I sat with my feet on the fender, I thought of Sphinx, I tried
to visualize it. Spoke the word out loud. I could only picture it
to myself quite small as seen from a distance. —C. M.
62 Clarissa Miles and Hermione Ramsden. [part
(b) Wednesday, October 18th, 1905. 7 p.m.
Bulstrode, Gerrard's Cross, Bucks.
I could not visualize, but seemed to feel that you were sitting
with your feet on the fender in an arm-chair, in a loose black
sort of tea-^own. The following words occurred to me :
Peter Evan or 'Eaven (Heaven).
Hour-glass (this seemed the chief idea).
Worcester deal box.
Daisy Millar.

x arm socket or some word like it.
X suspension bridge.
X Sophia Ridley.
x soupirer (in French), which I felt inclined to spell souspirer.
There is some word with the letter S. I don't seem quite to have
caught it. —H. R.
(e) I had been trying experiments with two other friends ever
since September 7th. These were only partially successful. I never
got the actual message intended, except on one occasion, when the
subject was one of which we had both been thinking. My impres-
sions were auditorij. —H. R.
Experiment II.
(a) Friday, October 20th, 1905.
SPHINX.
I tried to visualize Sphinx again. —C. M.
(b) Friday, October 20th, 1905. 7 p.m.
I received a letter from Miss Miles, saying, " Letter S quite
correct, the hour-glass shape extraordinarily correct, also S S at
the end or something like it. I shall try again to-morrow at
seven. It will come all right. —C. M."
After this I found it very difficult not to try and guess the
word instead of making my mind a blank.
Cossack.
Cross.
Compass (?)
Luzac (the publisher).
Luxor in Egypt.
Here I gave up in despair, then suddenly came the word
:
Whistle ! This I believed to be correct. —H. R.

The crosses indicate those impressions which Miss Ramsden marked at
the time as being especially vivid.

The most probable seems to be a small Maltese orange tree,
such as I have seen in London houses. —H. R.
Experiment IV.
(a) Sunday, October 22nd.
I never tried to visualize anything at all. About 6 o'clock to
7.30 I was writing letters to friends. One I was pondering over,
for it required an answer. It was from a Polish artist who had
come from Munich to finish Mrs. Jack Tennant's picture. —C. M.

(b) Wednesday, Oct. 25th. 7 to 7.30 p.m.
Fig, locket ; I visualized a locket on a chain, bath (oval shape),
piano, guitar, musical instrument, x locket with somebody's
hair, " Malthusian," VW pattern visualized, x oval frame for a
picture.
The frame has little lumps round it, might be a gilt picture
frame or a locket with diamonds or stones of some sort, but they
do not seem to shine. It might be a small miniature frame. It has
got nothing inside yet and you are wondering what you will put
in. There is glass, and it is slightly concave. It might be a
small hand looking-glass, but quite small.—H. R.
(c) At 7 p.m. I visualized a clock, or rather tried to. It was
very difficult, as I had had a model and had been drawing him
from five o'clock to six forty-five. The model was Mr. Macnab.
I was going to begin painting him life-size, and before settling on
the pose I was making two or three quick sketches of him by
electric light. I also put the stretcher up against him without the
canvas to see how much I would paint of him when the canvas
was stretched. He has a very thin face, which would look like a
distinct oval. The face I always leave blank and only fill in the
dress and hair with pencil. In the morning I arranged lockets,
jewelry and silver things. —C. M.
[One of these sketches of Mr. Macnab is reproduced here.]
(d) I sat to Miss Miles between 5 and 6.45 p.m. for a study
in life size for this picture. She made two or three quick sketches
for this in order to settle the pose of my picture.

(c) Having found that my attempts to hear were a failure, I
determined in future that I would try and visualize, although I
had never done so before, and am unable to see in a crystal.

often held letters for me and described scenes in connection with
the life of the writer. —H. R.

" Spectacles."
This was the only idea that came to me after waiting a long
time. I thought of "sense perception," but that only confirms the
above. My mind was such a complete blank that I fell asleep and
dreamt a foolish dream (but not about you). At 7.25 I woke
with a start. —H. R.
(c) Having found that it was much easier to impress an idea upon
the recipient when it was something that I had seen and thought
of later in the day, I determined that in future I would make my
choice accordingly, and think of some object in connection with
Miss Ramsden without specially sitting down to do so at 7 p.m.
On October 27th I attended the meeting of the S.P.R. at 20 Hanover
Square. I sat between Miss Lily Antrobus and Mr. Douglas
Murray. The latter had a curious pair of spectacles which attracted
my attention, made of two different glasses. These I fixed on as
the subject.—C. M.

Dear Miss Miles, —This is just to tell you that I sat next
you at the S.P.R. Meeting on Oct. 27th, 1905, when Mr.
Everard Feilding and Sir Oliver Lodge read papers, and that I
wore my divided eyeglasses, the upper part being used for distance,
the lower for reading.

Experiment VIII.

C. M.
(b) Tuesday, Oct. 31st, 1905. 7 p.m.
First it was the sun with rays and a face peering out of the rays.
Then something went round and round like a wheel. Then the
two seemed to belong together, and I thought of windmill. A
windmill on a hill where it was dark and windy and there were
dark clouds. Then it became the Crucifixion, and I saw the three

crosses on the left side of the hill, and the face on the cross looked
to the right, and it was dark. Wind and storm.
Surely this is right. It is the most vivid impression I have
ever had. I scarcely visualized at all, it was just the faintest indica-
tion possible, but the suggestion was most vivid. —H. R.
(c) I was painting Mr. Macnab, and there was a beautiful sunset
over the Oratory. Mr. Macnab, who was so seated that he could
watch it better than I could, walked to the window and drew my
attention to it. His face became illuminated with the rays of the sun.
It was a very windy, stormy evening, with weird orange lights in
the sky. The sun sets to the left of the Oratory. From my window
I see the central figure, and two sorts of uprights which look like
figures in the dim twilight. These three objects show out dark
against the sky to the left of the dome, on which there is a gold
cross. All this I visualized the whole evening for Miss Ramsden
to see. At first I could not account for the windmill. I discovered
a weathercock in the distance, on the top of a building. —C. M.

There was a most lovely sunset all over the Oratoiy, and to
which I drew Miss Miles's attention.

(e) Hitherto we had settled that Miss Miles was to make me
think of a definite object, and I sat down as usual with my eyes
shut, expecting to get a single idea like "spectacles." I was very
much surprised to see this vision, and believed it was a picture of
the Crucifixion which she was trying to make me see. I looked
for the women watching at the foot of the cross, and was surprised
that I could not see them. This is curious, because I distinctly
saw a figure on the cross, which was purely the result of my own
imagination. The rays of the sun and the cross itself appeared for
an instant to be luminous. I cannot exactly say how I saw the rest,
but it was the most vivid impression of the kind that I ever had
in my life.

:

Hermione Ramsden.
Some later experiments were tried in February, 1900, when
Miss Ramsden was in Sweden and Miss Miles in London. In
these practically no success was obtained, owing, Miss Miles
thought, to her having gone on too long without a break. It
was therefore decided that the experiments should be dropped
for a time, and they were resumed later in the year.
SECOND SERIES.
[Editorial Note.—Throughout this second series, which lasted
for about a month, from October 19th to November 14th,
1906, inclusive, Miss Miles was again agent and Miss
Ramsden percipient. Miss Miles was staying first near Bristol
and afterwards near Malmesbury, Wiltshire. Miss Ramsden
was living all the time near Kingussie, Inverness-shire, a
distance of about 400 miles, as the crow flies, from Bristol.
During the last three days of the experiments Miss Miles,
unknown to Miss Ramsden, was in London.
The general plan of action was that Miss Ramsden should
think of Miss Miles regularly at 7 p.m. on every day that
an experiment was to be tried, and write down her impressions
Liv.] Experiments in Thought-Transference. 71
on a post card or letter card, which was posted almost always
on the next morning to Miss Miles. These post cards or
letter cards were kept by Miss Miles and pasted into her
note book, so that the postmarks on them show the time of
despatch.
Miss Miles on her side had no fixed time for thinking of
Miss Eamsden, but thought of her more or less during the
whole day and in the evening noted briefly what ideas had
been most prominently before her mind during the day and
which she wished to convey, or thought might have been
conveyed, to Miss Eamsden. These notes were made generally
on a post card, which was, as a rule, posted to Miss Eamsden
next day. The post cards were afterwards returned to Miss
Miles to be placed with her records, so that here also the
postmarks show the date of despatch of the information to
Miss Eamsden.
Out of a total of 15 days' experiments, the idea that Miss
Miles was attempting to convey, as recorded on her post cards,
appeared on six occasions in a complete or partial form
among Miss Eamsden's impressions on the same date. But
it also happened that almost every day some of Miss
Eamsden's impressions represented pretty closely something
that Miss Miles had been seeing or talking about on the same
day. In other words, while the agent only succeeded occasion-
ally in transferring the ideas deliberately chosen by her for
the purpose, the percipient seemed often to have some sort of
supernormal knowledge of her friend's surroundings, irrespective
of what that friend had specially wished her to see.
When this happened, Miss Miles at once made careful notes
of the event or topic to which Miss Eamsden's statement
seemed to refer and also obtained corroborations from her
friends on the spot. Further, when Miss Eamsden gave
descriptions of scenes which seemed to Miss Miles like the
places where she was staying, she got picture post cards of
them, or photographed them, to show how far the descriptions
really corresponded.
The value of these results of course depends on the amount
of Miss Eamsden's knowledge or ignorance of Miss Miles's
doings and surroundings. Miss Miles was staying in the
neighbourhood of her own old home and was well acquainted
72 Clarissa Miles and Hermione Ramsden. [part
with the country and the people, and greatly interested in
revisiting them. Miss Ramsden knew that Miss Miles was
staying in a country house,— Blaise Castle, Henbury, near
Bristol, —but she had never been in that part of England
herself and did not know any of Miss Miles's friends there.
She did not even know the name of the owner of Blaise
Castle. She had first made Miss Miles's acquaintance when
the latter came to Woodhill, Gerrard's Cross, where she lived
from 1895-1897, this being close to the home of Miss
Bamsden's family. Further details as to her knowledge or
ignorance of particular circumstances are given in the report
of the experiments.
It has further to be considered how many of the successes
might be mere guesses,—whose correctness was due to chance
and not to telepathy. Miss Bamsden generally had a good
many impressions every time, and of course the more numerous
her impressions were, the more probable was it that one of
them would coincide by chance, with the idea named on the
post card by Miss Miles. Further, if we are allowed to
count as a success a case where one of Miss Bamsden's
impressions corresponded with one of the ideas which had
been prominently in Miss Miles's mind during the day,
though not named on the post card, the probability of
a chance coincidence is still greater. No exact calculation
of the probability, however, can be made, because almost
all the data for it are unknown. We cannot even count
the number of Miss Bamsden's recorded impressions, since
it is a matter of opinion and not of fact what constitutes
a single impression. E.g. ought we to count Bishoj) and
Archbishop in Experiment II. as one or two ? Some im-
pressions, again, are much more complicated than others, but
it would be impossible to say how many factors of equal
value they contain.
Still less is it possible to count the number of ideas in
Miss Miles's mind to which some of Miss Bamsden's
impressions might correspond. In Miss Bamsden's case we
are at least limited to the impressions she recorded, whereas
in Miss Miles's case we have to include not only the ideas
she noted down beforehand, but also an indefinite number
of unrecorded scenes and topics.
Experiments in Thought-Transference. 73
Further, Miss Bamsden could not avoid knowing something
of the general character of Miss Miles's surroundings, viz.
that she was staying in country-houses in the West of
England, and this must inevitably have guided her impressions
into certain general channels, or at least diverted them from
others. Some ideas must therefore have been more likely
than others to occur to her, but we cannot tell at all how
much more likely.
It is clear, therefore, that there can be no mathematical
proof that the correctness of Miss Eamsden's impressions
amounted to more than chance might have brought about,
and that on this fundamental point nothing more than a
rough empirical judgment can be formed. After studying
all the records, however, it appears to us that while some
of the coincidences of thought between the two experimenters
are probably accidental, the total amount of correspondence
is more than can be thus accounted for and points distinctly
to the action of telepathy between them.
The reader should note that all the experiments are here
given in full, not a mere selection of the more or less successful
ones. In the few cases where any part of Miss Eamsden's
description is omitted, this is indicated by marks of omission,
thus, . . .

The items of this record are arranged in the same order
as in the first series, namely
:
(a) Miss Miles's record, made before hearing from Miss
Kamsden, of what she wished or expected Miss Eamsden to
perceive.
(b) Miss Eamsden's record of her impressions, made before
hearing from Miss Miles what the latter's intentions had
been.
(c) Comments by Miss Miles, after receiving Miss Eamsden's
record, as to its correctness.
(cl) Corroborations by Miss Miles's friends as to circumstances
known to them.

At 6.30 I felt obliged to begin to think of you. Perhaps
what I saw first is only the recrudescence of Friday's cottage :
You are thinking of two windows in the upper story of a thatched
cottage, and there is a kind of hendadder leading up. Then I
suddenly saw Woodhill. 1
Now I see a very pretty window from
the inside, small glass panes, and a lot of books on shelves. You
are trying much harder to-night.
I see a butterfly and a very ornamental "rustic" bridge in a garden,
and a little girl with something in her hair, it may be the butterfly.
Is it a Japanese landscape 1 The bridge makes me think so.
Now I see a big, plain, old-fashioned English country house among
trees ; it is rather a distant view, I am looking up at it from below,
standing in what seems to be a ravine full of trees. There are all
sorts of precious curios in the house. I see a silver buckle or silver
belt with this buckle.
Now I see a water-mill, or is it the Great Wheel at Earl's Court ?
It is a mechanical contrivance of some kind, rather like a railway
with carriages going round. Perhaps it is a child's toy, a switchback
railway 1 There are children in the house where you are staying,
but I am not sure if they belong to the place, they may be on a
visit. I seem to be "psychometrizing" your surroundings (but
without holding your letter). I get a name :
" J. Verreker," and the
Again I see the butterfly, this time it looks like a fine Oriental
specimen with points on the wings.
Then a fishing boat lying on the sand at the mouth of a river,
and a name written in the sky :
" Bella, or Butter, or Buller." I
see the " B," and the double consonant in the middle of the word.
There is a pet bird or a stuffed bird. That's all. —H. R.
(c) I tried to make Miss Ramsden think I was living in a castle,
as the name of the house would make you think so. It is a square
old-fashioned country house, situated close to the woods. It is full
of precious curios, and has a very fine collection of old Italian
masters, splendid picture gallery. Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Harford
were on a visit with their little girl called Joan. The governess's
name was Miss Vidal.

There is a water-wheel in Blaise Woods, for a stream runs
through it.
The view of the house so graphically described is seen by the
"Cottage in the Wood," and well known. A deep ravine full of trees
stands between you and the house, which is almost hidden by trees
;
the right wing, which is completely hidden from view, extends some
way to the right. The house stands on a hill from where I saw it
[on Sunday, October 21]. The Cottages, called Blaise Hamlet, is a
show place, close to Blaise. I visited them with Mr. John Harford
and his sister on Saturday.
On Sunday morning we walked to the Castle. In the afternoon
we walked to Kingsweston and had tea. Mr. and Mrs. Phelips were
staying there. There is a splendid view over the Severn and there
are always fishing boats lying at the mouth of the river Avon.

Sunday, October 21st, 1906, I walked up to the Castle in the

drew Miss Miles's attention to the very fine stained glass windows
(designed by Albert Diirer) in the principal room in the Castle,
which is panelled with oak, and quite round in shape.
In the evening, Miss Miles looked at a scrap book, with my brother,
and was amused at some comic pictures of a man teaching a little girl
and boy to dance the minuet.
I generally wear a belt with a large Norwegian buckle, chased gold
and silver, which was much admired by Miss Miles.

[Miss Ramsden wrote later :]
I have never been in the neighbourhood of Bristol, and had
never heard of Blaise Castle beyond the fact that Miss Miles was
staying there. Then I imagined it to be a house with a tower
and turrets like a Scottish castle.
I wrote "English country house," because the situation of it as
seen in my vision reminded me of a Scottish castle with turrets
which I pass on the railroad between Edinburgh and Kingussie.
It stands among trees with a wooded ravine below, and a river
;
but I gradually realised the difference : first, that it was a square
house, and not at all my idea of a castle, and secondly, that there
was no river.
Nearly all my impressions came to me in this way ; I mean
that at first they reminded me of some place I had seen before,
as when the stone greenhouse at Blaise Castle [see below,
Experiment VII.] made me think of one like it at Osterley, and
the church there reminded me of Birkin Church in Yorkshire.
But gradually the differences became apparent. H. R.

there met Mr. and Mrs. Phelips, of Montacute in Somersetshire, to
whom my cousin introduced us. Miss Ramsden wrote PAelip on
the card just as I pronounced it with a strong accent on first syllable.
I thought the name was so spelt, for I did not quite hear how my
cousin pronounced it. We talked a great deal about the name since
Sunday.
On Wednesday, October 24th, I left Blaise Castle, driving across
the Downs. I saw a school playing hockey ; some boys dressed
in flannel suits. Also many other games take place there.

Again I saw something like a church tower, 1

was like a house, or row of cottages, alms-houses, or vicarage.
It was overgrown with creepers, there was a window in the porch,
each side. There is a poor sort of entrance, leading off the high
road thus : with a common wooden gate. Wall on the right,
enclosing kitchen garden, fine old park trees on the left.
It was a long drive to get there, and you returned after sunset

On looking through to-day the proofs of your correspondence with
Miss Ramsden, I noticed the word " Lotherton " in a letter dated
October 29th, 1906, written by her to you when you were at Blaise
Castle and I was there.
Now there is no doubt that I told you then that I was going to
stay some three weeks later witli Colonel French-Gascoigne at
Lotherton Hall, near Leeds, at the same time as I told you about
my visit to Tichborne and the curious tradition about owls haunting
a certain family, which is alluded to in the letters

"Mea Mafra. Mademoiselle." French Governess? A waterfall;
it looks artificial because it is very broad and regular, and not more
than two or three feet high ; it might be a mill stream. Then I begin
to see a house, a farmhouse ? with a very tall poplar near it. There
is rising ground—not to be called hills—and young plantations.
Then I see the house itself, where you are staying. The drive up to
the entrance among shrubs and trees reminds me of the H 's
house at W ; the situation is the same, but the country where
you are is much prettier, and the house is very much larger and more
important looking than theirs. It is not as large as Blaise Castle,
but it is very much more cosy and comfortable. The architecture is as
different as any two houses could possibly be ; this house is long and
straggly and has towers and turrets—at least, points. There are a
great many out-houses too, barns and stables. There are steps up
to a small door—not the front door—about twelve steps or more ; it
looks to me like a narrow staircase outside the house.

Then there is a church very near, and it has a pointed spire, and
there are Gothic windows lit up with a beautiful white light that
shines through the pattern on the window. There may be an evening
service going on. I doubt whether I am right in putting these
windows so near the church ; I only see such a little bit at a time
that I don't know how to piece the bits together.
I think that part of the house is older than the rest and has
Gothic windows ; it may be a chapel attached to the house, or else
a kind of conservatory. What impresses me most are the pretty
windows, I keep seeing them in all shapes and sizes ; are they
mullion windows ? Three points, three windows. I see a crown
and wonder if it is sculptured in stone, a kind of crest. —H. R.
(e) On November 2nd, I left Blaise Castle for above address and
drove out with my brother Napier in the afternoon. The descrip-
tion of house and spire of Church—the Belfry, —is very good. I
saw many windows, especially those at Burtonhill, with electric
light behind them.
There is a factory with poplars close to it, and it was worked by the
River Avon, which is the mill stream, and has a fall of two or three
feet. There are plantations on some rising ground to the right.

Miles's flat in London. I must have seen these before, though I did
not remember them at the time.

[Miss Miles informs us that the mill is a silk factory at Malmes-
bury, and the road shown in the photograph here reproduced is the
one which would be taken in going from Burtonhill into Malmes-
bury. The view is taken from the Malmesbury side of the factory.
On receiving Miss Ramsden's description, Miss Miles thought at once
of this factory, because of the mill stream, but she did not remember
the single poplar nor its position in relation to the building. She
then went to look at the place, which she had frequently passed
in going into Malmesbury, found the poplar and took a photograph
of the whole scene to compare with Miss Ramsden's description.

I don't know what to think of this evening's experiment ; either
it is a complete failure, or else it is the best success we have ever

saw that it was a window with white dimity curtains and a criss-cross
pattern of green with little pink rosebuds in the centre of each.
First the curtains were shut across the window, and then they were
drawn aside. It was a school-room, a big, long, low room, with a
long, wide window. The height and width of the room is not
much more than that of the window. There is a large table in the
middle laid for tea. Two little girls with their hair down their
backs, loosely tied with blue and white ribbons, are waltzing
together very prettily. I can hear the time they keep, but I
cannot hear the music. You and another lady are standing watch-

Miss Kamsden, commenting on the whole series of experi-
ments, writes
:
I should like to point out the importance of getting more people
to take part in these experiments, because it is only by comparing
a large number of experiments that we can hope to find out how
thoughts are transferred. Sometimes they seem to come as ideas,
at other times as words, and more often than not, their real
meaning is not transferred at all. I was much interested in
reading Mrs. Verrall's account of her attempt to get at a Greek
sentence which her husband had tried to transfer to her tele-
pathically and without her knowledge. (See Proceedings S.P.R.,
Vol. XX., pp. 156-167.) The manner in which the sentence was
transferred in fragments, first in ideas, and then in words bearing
a certain similarity in sound, is very like some of my experiences,
as, for instance, the occasion when the idea of a Bishop was
conveyed by an apparently nonsensical word, "latme," which in
its turn suggested " Bishop Latimer."
There is another point which I do not remember to have heard
discussed, and that is the influence of suggestion as an aid to the
development of psychic faculties. I have found it very effective
in my own case. I am not a good visualizer, and although I
sometimes see visions in the same way as one sees the so-called
"hypnagogic illusions," which most of us have experienced, though
perhaps rarel}', in the moments between sleeping and waking, I
am not able to visualize at will, nor can I see in a crystal. Blaise
Castle appeared to me after the manner of a hypnagogic illusion ;
it was a perfect picture in colour, in fact it was the place itself
—
so it seemed to me—though I did not know that it was Blaise
Castle, as I had imagined the latter to be a real old castle with
turrets.
Instead of trying to visualize scenes, I tried to see them with
"the mind's eye," as one recalls a familiar scene;—in this way
I was able to describe the garden at Blaise Castle with the bridge
and the steps, which I compared to " a Japanese landscape."
Some of the other scenes were actually visualized, but in a very
fragmentary way : I mean that I did not see the whole landscape,
but only the " upper windows in a thatched cottage " at Henbury,
and the mullion windows lighted by electric light at Burtonhill.
One fact which is rather puzzling is that the most vivid
impressions are not always the most correct ; and it has often
happened that those which are the most surprisingly correct are
liv.] Experiments in Thought-Transference. 93
some which were not intentionally transferred at all. I refer to
the four occasions on which I received words which conveyed no
special meaning to me :
" Phelip—Yester—Tichborne —Lotherton."
It will always be a matter of lasting regret that I did not record
my impression that " Phelip" was in some way connected with
Mrs. Phelips of Montacute, as it turned out to be actually her.
I think it was quite 10 years since I heard her name mentioned,
so that it would have formed an interesting part of the evidence
if I had recorded it at the time.
Before beginning these experiments with Miss Miles, I had
tried with several other friends with more or less success ; but
unfortunately we were not careful enough to write down the
results immediately, so that the experiments cannot be considered
of evidential value. Still one fact is worth noting: that three
times in the course of the same week I heard a distinct voice
;
the first time it was a recognised voice, the two other times it
was a "soundless voice," like a whisper, yet unlike anything I
ever heard before, because although it sounded so clear and
distinct, yet I was perfectly aware that it was purely subjective,
and that if any one else had been in the room, they would not
have heard it. On all three occasions I received quite long
sentences ;
indeed, on the second occasion it was as long as
a letter, the voice dying away and becoming inaudible, and then
starting afresh. Hermione Ramsden.

TIL
REPORT ON SOME RECENT SITTINGS FOR PHYSICAL
PHENOMENA IN AMERICA.
By Alice Johnson.
Introduction.
At a meeting of the Society held two or three years ago,
Dr. J. H. Gower, a member of the Society, described some
remarkable physical phenomena which he had witnessed in a
private circle composed entirely of his own friends, with no
professional or regular medium among them. These sittings
had been carried on at intervals for several years, from 1902
onwards, in a large town in one of the Western States of
America. The most interesting results obtained were the
occasional movements of a heavy table, untouched by any of
the sitters, and in a good light.
These more striking phenomena, however, happened only very
rarely ; that is, not more than about half-a-dozen times in the
course of four or five years. As a rule, the table moved
only when the hands of the sitters were resting on it ; but
raps—both with and without contact—are reported to have
been heard very frequently.
Intelligible sentences were also spelt out through raps ; the
first ones purported to come from a friend of Dr. Gower's,
T. W., who had recently died ; and most of them were said
to be both correct and characteristic, but gave practically no
information that was not known to the sitters. Later, other
" controls " appeared, giving messages as to their names, place
of death, etc. These, as far as they could be verified at all,
turned out to be entirely wrong. Consequently, some of the
lit.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 95
sitters, who had been at first inclined to attribute all the
phenomena to the action of spirits, renounced this explanation
almost entirely ; but none of them, I believe, has ever wavered
in his conviction that the tables have on several occasions
moved without being touched.
We tried a series of sittings with Dr. Gower in the S.P.B.
rooms, but no results were obtained, except very slight ones
on one occasion with a lady who was unwilling to try further
experiments. Dr. Gower was, however, very anxious to do
all in his power to provide us with evidence that should be
satisfactory to the Society and, in consequence of his invita-
tion to me to take part in his friends' sittings, I went to
America in August, 1906, and spent nearly a month in the
town where they live, being enabled to do so by the generosity
of a member of the Society, who made an anonymous gift to
its funds for the purposes of this and another investigation.
The phenomena I witnessed were, I was told, about up to the
average of what the sitters were accustomed to, but there were
no decided movements without contact. It has been thought
desirable, nevertheless, that these sittings should be reported
to the Society ; and in order that the reader may have all
the material available for judging of the whole case, I propose
to give first as complete an account as possible of the earlier
sittings, which were unfortunately reported in a very meagre
manner.
I. History of the Early Sittings.
Dr. Gower, to whom we are indebted for all the evidence
in regard to these early sittings, was originally a musician
by profession, holding the Oxford degree of Mus. Doc, but
has now been for some years engaged in mining, and lives
part of the year in England and part in America. He has
been keenly interested in the subject of spiritualism for some
twenty years, has a wide knowledge of professional mediums
and mecliumship in England and America, and is also a good
amateur conjurer. During all the years that he has studied
the subject, he has—so he tells me—rarely, if ever, met
with any phenomena that appeared to him genuine, except
among his friends in this town, but he is still indefatigable in
his search for evidence.

Some particulars of the early sittings were given briefly in
the following letters from Dr. Gower to Dr. Hodgson :
May 17th, 1903.
Last winter in some friends and I, partly anticipating
some amusement, and perhaps some experiences, tried our luck at
" table turning."
The results were so astounding that I venture to write to you on
the subject. My friends were a prominent physician, his wife and
two daughters.
We sat around a heavy oak table ; our hands, joined by touching
the little fingers, were placed lightly upon the top of the table.
Under these conditions, rappings, movements of the table, and
intelligent answers to questions happened frequently ; but of these
I need say no more. After a time the phenomena were so pro-
nounced that we decided to raise our hands off the table, and
were much astonished to find that the demonstrations continued. . . .
Finally, we stood around the table (with our hands joined) at a
distance of about two feet. The table still moved, and the rappings
were as loud as before. This occurred on possibly a dozen occasions.
More than once I slipped my finger between the leaves of a closed
book or magazine, and the table (?) was able to see what letters
of the alphabet my fingers covered, indicating these by means of
" raps." On most occasions this intelligent force, for intelligent it
was, purported to be directed by a friend of mine who has been
dead for about six years, 1
and some evidence of his identity was
forthcoming.
It is needless to say that trickery of any kind was out of the
question, the phenomena being frequently witnessed by several
disinterested, sceptical, and even antagonistic friends.
John H. Gower.
June -2nd, 1903.
Since my arrival in we have renewed our sittings, but
the introduction of other parties has, I think, somewhat modified
the results. However, rappings on the table and movements without
contact occurred on three occasions out of four sittings. On the
other occasion nothing unusual happened. Indeed, the sitting was
a complete failure. On one occasion, after our seance, and indeed
after we had partaken of refreshments which had been placed upon
the table, and whilst it was fairly covered with plates, dishes
1
This was the "control," T. W., referred to above.
liv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 97
etc., the table made a series of movements entirely unassisted by
any visible agent. ... I will endeavour to have independent records
made of our next meetings, and also get my friends to write down
what they have themselves observed. However, we are absolutely
agreed as to main facts. . . .
November 23rd, 1903.
Since I arrived here we have had three sittings, one of which
resulted in nothing. It is not easy to make a contemporaneous
record of all that takes place. However, I made the attempt, but
the communications were somewhat indefinite, and were obtained
partly by answers to leading questions. I hope next time to have
a stenographer present.
At two of the sittings the following phenomena were observed
many times :
(1) Movements of the heavy oak table without any contact of the
table with the sitters.
(2) Raps occurring on the table in answer to questions when the
conditions as to the sitters were as in No. 1.
(3) The rolling backwards and forwards of a pencil which I had
placed upon the table, and which I had requested should be moved
by the invisible agent—(none of the sitters, of course, touching the
table at the time).
One of these sittings was described in detail by one of the
principal sitters, the physician referred to in Dr. Gower's first
letter (spoken of in this paper as Dr. Williams), as follows
:
[Monday], December 7, 1903.
My dear Dr. Gower,
In response to your request that I should write out a
description of the occurrence as I noticed it at Mrs. B.'s house
last Thursday evening [December 3rd, 1903], I will make the follow-
ing statement
:
According to invitation, my wife and I arrived at Mrs. B.'s house
about nine o'clock. We found sitting at a round dining table
yourself, Mr. J. T., your cousin Mrs. W., Mrs. B., her mother
(Mrs. W.)}
and her young sister aged about fifteen years. In the
party there were no avowed Spiritualists, and no one present who
took the matter very seriously except yourself. The room was a
small one, say 11 x 14 feet. The table was an ordinary small round
extension table on a central pedestal, which divided on making
extension. The meeting was essentially social, and I do not believe
G
98 Alice Johnson. [part
that any one present would in any way attempt any deception
upon the others, or in any way do any trickery or any underhand
work of any kind. My wife and I joined you at the table, and
for some hour and a half we had various knockings, although nothing
very intelligible and distinct in this line ; and the table moved in
various ways about the room, the lights being turned down. As
the table moved in some directions it was frequently separated at
the line of union and would close again. During almost all of this
time the lights were turned low, and it was impossible to distinguish
details of individual movement. Occasionally our hands were taken
off the table, and I believe that the table moved several times
without any one being in contact with it. Mrs. B., as well as
yourself, being a professional musician, the lights were occasionally
turned on, and music was interspersed during the evening.
About eleven o'clock refreshments were served, during which Mr. B.
returned, he also being a professional musician. As we sat round
the table in the full strong light, we had various table movings
and knockings. Later, as we all sat encircling it, we all drew
back a short distance from it, so that no one could, even had they
desired, [have] touched the pedestal or the table itself without being
plainly seen, and the table was requested to open as it had done
before. This it immediately slowly did, until the central space
was about eight inches wide ; with no one touching it, it was at
once requested to close again, which it immediately began to do in
a jerky, weakening way, the strength seeming to fail at last, when
it was about half closed. After waiting a few moments we placed
our fingers upon the edge of it and requested it to close com-
pletely, which it did ; the whole opening and shutting occupying
the space of twelve or fifteen minutes, I should estimate. This
was the most striking phenomenon that we witnessed during the
evening.
I may further state that at various times during the last year or
so, with about the same party present, I have on a few occasions
seen the table about which we sat, make short, quick movements
when I was satisfied that none of the party were in contact with
it in any way, and I have repeatedly heard distinct knockings upon
the table ; sometimes apparently intelligent answers to questions,
such as giving a distinct number of knocks as requested, and the
three knocks or the one knock for yes or no when the lights were
turned on fully, and I believed that there was no contact by any
one in the room, either directly or indirectly. I have no explanation
LIV.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 99
whatever to make for these phenomena. They appear to be produced
by an intelligence absolutely free from the direct physical influence
of any one present.
Dr. Gower afterwards obtained for me an account written
by Mrs. B., the lady in whose house this sitting was held, as
follows. The account was enclosed in a letter from Dr. Gower,
dated December 11th, 1904.
I have often heard of various demonstrations of psychical pheno-
mena, but until last winter had never seen anything of the kind
myself. My first experience was at the house of Dr. W., a prominent
physician. Others in the circle were all well known to me>
and I am sure that there could have been no trickery of any kind
used. During the evening we had answers to several questions
given us, using the alphabet, and requesting a tap to be given on
the table at the proper letter as it was named. We also saw the
table move perceptibly without contact.
At my own house, some weeks following, we met again. We
sat in the dining room around a very heavy round dining table.
This table is usually clamped to prevent its opening, but the clamp
had been broken in moving. The table opens and closes with
difficulty, and we generally require the assistance of a second
person when opening it. During the early part of the evening the
table moved through the double doors until it caught under the
edge of the parlour rug and could go no further. We set it back
into the dining room again and stopped for a while. After we had
had some light refreshment we left the table set as it was, covered
with dishes, glasses, decanters, etc., and with two gas jets turned
up as high as they would go, sat around the table again. The
table opened slowly, and with no jerking whatever, just as smoothly
as if it had been oiled, and after that opened and closed as we
directed, moved toward any person in the room whom we named.
All this time we stood and sat around it at a distance of about
two to three feet, and no one touched it either with his feet or
his hands.
The following general corroborative statement by some of
the other sitters, whose names are given in full in the original
document (now in my possession), was sent to Dr. Hodgson
:
Dec. 1th, 1903.
We, the undersigned, have witnessed the following phenomena
at experimental circles held at various times during the present year,

I made Dr. Gower's acquaintance in January, 1904, and
he gave me in conversation many details of the sittings
held previously to that date. On one occasion, he told me,
the sitters requested that various liquids on the table should
be shaken by the force ; for instance, the water in a water
jug and whiskey in a bottle. Each of these shook successively
in accordance with the requests, without being touched in any
way by the sitters, and the table being motionless at the time.
He gives the following general account of the phenomena
in a letter to me
:
NORTHINGTON, MULGRAVE ROAD, SUTTON, SURREY,
March Uth, 1904.
It is without the slightest hesitation that I subscribe my name
to the following statement, as there never has existed a doubt in
Liv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 101
my mind as to the facts witnessed on so many occasions, not only
by myself but by many others. . . .
The sittings were held in 1902 and 1903. The majority of them
were held in the house of [Dr. W.], but the same phenomena as
seen here were witnessed in several other houses and also in my
private room in the Hotel.
The phenomena to which I refer may be briefly stated as
follows
:
(1) Movements of both heavy and light tables without any
contact whatever with any of the sitters.
(2) Eaps made upon the tables when no one was touching them.
These raps occurred usually as signals in giving answers to
questions put by the sitters.
(3) Movements of various articles which happened to be at the
time upon the tables and in response to requests that such
movements should be made (no one touching the tables).
(4) Information by means of raps. The information obtained was
sometimes known and sometimes unknown by any of the sitters.
(With and without contact).
(5) Information given in the same way which was not only
unknown but unobtainable by any one present.
The names and addresses of the principal witnesses were
given in this letter.
Dr. Gower returned to America soon after this, but paid
another short visit to England during November and December
of the same year. Mr. Feilding and I then arranged for
some sittings with him, as he was as anxious as we were to
establish the facts of the case. At the first sitting, held on
November 17th, 1904, at the S.P.E. Booms at 20 Hanover
Square, raps were heard on the table on which the sitters'
hands were placed, and these raps answered questions. More
than once (as recorded in my notes made the next day) the
sitters lifted their hands from the table, keeping them linked
at a level of three or four inches above its surface, and raps
were obtained under these circumstances. On several occasions
raps were heard from the direction of the door, variously
interpreted by different sitters as on a small table near two
of them, on a revolving bookcase, or on the glass of a picture,
or of the Globe-Wernicke bookcases, which are against one
of the walls near the door and several feet distant from the
102 Alice Johnson. [part
table round which we were sitting. Eaps were also heard
on the chair of one of the sitters, a lady known to be
possessed of mediumistic powers. It seemed possible then
that some of these raps had been produced without contact,
but the conditions were obviously inconclusive.
-At the two next sittings, nothing occurred.
The fourth was held in a private house in London, where
again the lady just referred to was present. Eaps were
again obtained freely—a few apparently without contact
—
and again on this lady's chair. The hypothesis occurred to
me at the time that all the raps were produced automatically
and unconsciously by some of the sitters, who had perhaps
unwittingly cultivated this power in themselves, as many
persons cultivate the far more common automatism of table-
tilting.
The lady with whom the raps appeared to be chiefly
associated objected, however, to any further investigation, and
we were only able to hold one more sitting—again a blank
one—at 20 Hanover Square, before Dr. Gower went back
to America. On January 15th, 1905, he wrote to me
enclosing reports of three sittings held in the early part of
that month since his return. The reports were made from
notes taken during the sittings by Professor H. (whose full
name and address, as well as those of the other sitters,
were given) and Dr. Gower added :
" I think the tipping
up, probably 20 times, of a heavy table, entirely untouched
as far as one could see, one of the most wonderful things I
have ever seen, even in this connection." At the two first
sittings raps were obtained both with and apparently without
contact of the sitters with the table, but movements of the
table only with contact. The report of the third sitting is
as follows
:
Stance No. 3. Reported from notes made at the time by Dr.
Gower.
Sitting commenced at nine o'clock, at the residence of Dr. W.
Present: Mrs. W., Mrs. B., Mrs. P., Miss F. W., Mr. E. P.,
Mr. J. T., and Dr. John H. Gower. The above named formed a
circle around a heavy oak library table, and placed their hands
thereon.
About 9.25 raps were heard, and in answer to questions the
Liv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 103
name " Albert Shaw " was rapped out. He had been dead nine
years, and was the same spirit who announced himself at the
previous sitting.
Question : Can you rap on the table if we raise our hands 1
Ans. . . . Three raps (Yes.)
In answer to further questions it was said no message would be
given, that he merely wished to give a demonstration of power.
Hands were raised off the table, and for some time various groups
of raps were given as requested by the sitters. Hands again
placed on the table, which then moved frequently.
At about ten o'clock the sitting suspended and refreshments were
served, and at 10.30 the sitting was resumed, the table being fairly
well covered with dishes, plates, glasses, etc. Very loud raps were
soon given, and after about half-an-hour the table moved about
the room, sometimes with the hands of the sitters resting lightly
upon it, and sometimes when none of them were touching it at
all. During these occurrences Professor H. and Mr. B. joined the
party, and for the last half-hour of the seance the table moved
about the room in any direction the sitters requested that it should,
entirely without contact. It moved into the hall, and back again
through the middle of the room into the dining room, a distance
of at least twenty feet. All this time the sitters were not touching
it, but with joined hands followed said movements at a distance
of about one foot from the table. Dr. Gower suggested that the
sliding movement should cease, and that the table should be
requested to tilt. The table being a heavy one, and the dishes,
etc., still upon it, this of course required considerable force to
accomplish, but the table tilted in response to the request of the
observers, probably a score of times, and at no time was contact
with any of the sitters visible.
Copies of these reports having been forwarded at the same
time to Dr. Hodgson, he sent Dr. Gower a series of questions,
to which Dr. Gower replied as follows
:
7th February, 1905.
The positions of the sitters' feet and knees during the movements
of the table without contact cannot very well be seen, but as the
circle is made up of a few friends, I have no doubt as to their
good faith, and am quite convinced that there is no fraud or trickery
practised by any of them.
Moreover, some of the movements, such as the extension top
104 Alice Johnson. [part
table opening, the liquids moving, and the rolling backwards and
forwards of a pencil, could not have been caused by the feet or
knees under any circumstances.
The table above referred to is supported only by a central
pedestal, which would be entirely out of reach. When these move-
ments are taking place we are standing around it (the table) with
joined hands, probably about one foot from the table, and as the
movements occur we follow them, maintaining the same position.
Nothing is known of " Albert Shaw," and the information given
by " raps " is very meagre and indefinite. Indeed, " he " declines to
give messages, and confines "himself" to producing the movements
and rappings.
I may say that the rappings are usually as loud when the hands
are off the table as they are when the hands are on. . . .
Dr. Gower having written to me on Dec. 23rd, 1904, to
ask that I would arrange some experiment as a test of possible
clairvoyance on the part of the " controls " who purported to
produce the phenomena of the American sittings, Mr. Feilding
and I arranged a " test " as follows : we took a pack of
cards, shuffled them, and drew out three at random without
looking at them, wrapped each in a piece of paper and put
it in an envelope, which was then marked and sealed. We
then drew three cards at random from the rest of the pack
and looked at them. Each of these three was put into an
envelope, which was marked and sealed, and finally the remain-
der of the pack was put into an envelope, which was also>
marked and sealed. Care was taken to keep all the cards
face downwards all the time (except the three intentionally
looked at), and we did not even touch their faces, so that we
might avoid, as far as possible, any normal means of knowing
which cards were in the first three envelopes. All seven
envelopes were then locked up together in the S.P.R. rooms,,
no one knowing of the experiment except ourselves and Dr.
Gower, to whom we wrote an account of what we had done.
It will be seen that there were thus three cards entirely
unknown to any one, so that if they were rightly guessed at
one of the sittings, the result would point to clairvoyance
—
properly so called—on the part either of the sitters in America
or of some external intelligence ; while there were also three
cards known to Mr. Feilding and myself, so that if these
Liv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 105
were guessed, the result might be attributed to telepathy from
one or both of us.
After receiving our account of what test had been arranged,
Dr. Gower wrote :
January 2%th, 1905.
My friends and I think that you have provided us with an
excellent test. However, I feel some little concern about it, as we
had one sitting two evenings ago. There were present those of my
friends who usually have the best results, viz., Dr., Mrs. and Miss
Williams, and Mrs. B. and her mother. We sat with our hands
upon the table and placed your letter on the centre of it.
But for the first time, I think, in our experience, we got absolutely
nothing. Not even a " rap " or a movement of the table, of any
kind whatever. The sitting lasted for two hours. Does it mean that
the " spirits " are disgusted with us for seeking for tests, or that
they failed from over-anxiety on their part and ours ?
We will try, however, several times, and I will report later.
It seems probable that this negative result was due to
inhibition of the automatic impulses of the sitters through
suggestion, since at the sitting of January 1st, 1905, when
the " control," T. W., was asked (before Dr. Gower knew the
nature of our " test "),
" Could you read a word put in an
envelope in the room of the S.P.B. in London and com-
municate it to us ?
" it answered (by raps) " No."
Nevertheless, on March 25th, 1905, at a sitting held at
the house of Dr. Williams, and reported at the time by him,
raps came on the table in front of Dr. Gower, having the
peculiar flurried or duplicated characteristic which marked those
generally ascribed to T. W. Dr. Gower then described the
nature of the test, and asked the " control " if the cards could be
seen by him and named to the sitters. The " control " expressed
his doubt of being able to succeed, but said he would try,
and would report the result if the same party would sit in
the same way on the following Wednesday evening, March
29th. On this evening they accordingly re-assembled, and
were informed through the raps that the three cards were
:
Ace of Spades, Queen of Hearts, and 2 of Spades. At this
sitting it was noteworthy that no raps were heard except in
answer to the questions about the experiment, nor did any
movements of the table, with or without contact, occur. This
;
106 Alice Johnson. [part
again seems to illustrate the dependence of the phenomena on
suggestion, since they occurred as predicted at the previous
sitting.
On April 27th, 1905, Dr. Gower being then in London,
I opened the three envelopes in his presence and found that
the three cards were : King of Hearts, Knave of Hearts, and
Ace of Hearts. We looked through the remainder of the pack
to see if the cards named by T. W. were either at the top
or bottom, or all three together, but found them separately
in the middle of it. Thus the amount of success in this
experiment (one suit right and one number right) was prac-
tically equal to the most probable degree of success by
chance. It is perhaps hardly surprising that nothing more
was attained.
During the sittings in February and March, 1905, various
communications were received through raps from supposed
" controls," giving names, addresses, and other particulars, which
turned out incorrect or unverifiable. Dr. Gower and some
of his friends also tried some experiments at this time with a
non-professional medium living in the same town. The circle
was an entirely private one, consisting of husband and wife,
a brother of the wife, and another relative, who had developed
" direct voices," materialisations, lights, etc. All were well
known in the town, and of apparent respectability and honesty.
Dr. Gower and his friends went to their house by invitation,
and held three Ion" sittings with them. The circumstances
o o
of the first led them to suspect fraud, but they were unwilling
to believe it, on account of the reputation of the family. At
the third sitting one of the investigating party happened to
be in a favourable position for close observation, and saw by
the light coming through a slit in the window blind that the
lady of the house was manipulating some rather simple
" materialised " forms. This being confirmed by the observa-
tions of the others both as to the forms and the voices, left
them no choice but to attribute the whole of the phenomena
to deliberate and apparently unmotived fraud.
This discovery, together with the fictitious character of nearly
all the supposed communications given to his own circle by
raps, except those purporting to come from T. W., naturally
led Dr. Gower to scrutinise, even more carefully than before,
liv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 107
the conditions of the sittings with his friends. They had by
this time—on account of the untrustworthiness of the com-
munications—given up the spiritistic interpretation which they
were at first inclined to apply to the phenomena ; but they all
remained—and I believe that to this day they all remain
—
convinced that phenomena had happened which could not be
explained by ordinary causes. Dr. Grower wrote to us at this
time that though, of course, he could not help taking into
account the personal character of the friends who had long
been well known to him, he had made every effort to judge
of the evidence apart from this, and it appeared to him that
nothing short of a wholesale deception on an organised plan
would explain everything. The phenomena had been observed
by a number of people in different houses, and with different
sitters, he alone being always present. This, together with his
reputation as an amateur conjurer, had, in fact, caused real
suspicion to fall on him outside his own circle, and it was
generally rumoured in the town that he was the trickster.
At a sitting held at Dr. Williams's house on August 1st,
1905, after some raps with and without contact, and move-
ments of the table with contact, the following occurred, as
reported by Dr. Gower
:
We then, at my suggestion, stood up and joined hands at a
distance of about six to ten inches from the table. Several move-
ments of the table were observed without any apparent contact. At
this point the conversation (which had been general, and at times
upon topics other than the phenomena under observation) ceased.
Miss M. F. requested that a movement should be made of some
candy which was lying upon the table top, and Mrs. H. suggested
that a ring, which she took off her finger and placed upon the
table, should move. Two members of the circle thought that they
detected some movement in these objects. I did not do so.
This last remark is of interest as indicating the possibility
of illusion on the part of the sitters in regard to some at
least of the supposed movements of objects without contact.
Slight illusions of this kind are of course not uncommon, and
are by no means difficult to produce by suggestion. Thus, it
seems not unlikely that the reported movements of liquids
(see p. 100) were really illusory, and the hypothesis that all
108 Alice Johnson. [part
the movements without contact can be explained in the same
way cannot be dismissed. Nevertheless, the cases as here
reported go so far beyond what is known to occur to persons
in a normal condition of consciousness that more evidence is
of course recmired before this hypothesis can be regarded as
established.
In November, 1905, Dr. Gower wrote to me that he had
then three circles in which raps, without apparent contact,
occurred. During a visit of his to England in January and
February, 1906, we held six more sittings with him, but
unfortunately with no result.
At the end of April, 1906, Professor William James, on
his way home from Leland Stanford University, made a short
stay at in the hope of witnessing some of the phenomena.
The sitters, in the absence of Dr. Gower, were, however, dis-
inclined to try experiments, but they talked freely of their
experiences to Professor James, and he gives a brief report as
follows
:
April 30th, 1906.
We got here at noon yesterday, and opened communication
with Dr. Williams, who told me that Dr. Gower had not yet
arrived from Europe, but who gave me and helped me to much
testimony as to the physical phenomena reported. Professor H.,
Mr. J. T., and Mrs. Williams (whom I didn't see till this morn-
ing), all said that movements without contact were so absolutely
certain in their minds as no longer to cause astonishment. Yet no
systematic notes had been taken, and the evidence, strongly as it
impressed me (especially Mrs. Williams's, who [seemed to take
little interest in the phenomena], but who replied, when I asked
her straight whether she believed she had seen her tables move
without contact, "of course !"), —the evidence, I say, cannot be used
to convince others, but subjectively has much impressed me.
Their circles began over ten years ago, Dr. Gower being their
starter and enthusiastic director. Dr. Williams thinks that Dr.
Gower is the essential medium ; he says that Dr. Gower considers
Mrs. Williams more essential. They have sat little without Dr.
Gower, and have never (?) had contactless movements when he was
not present. Mr. T. proved himself to be a very efficient solicitor
of movements—the most successful method being heartily to suggest
to the table that it should move.
Liv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 109
Movements with contact were often inexplicable in Dr. Williams's
opinion by muscular pressure. They used various tables in various
places, no one table seeming more propitious. An extension dining
table figured, and a very light stand. The table most in use at
Dr. Williams's was a solid oak one about 3 ft. square on top, with
casters. There was also a much used oaken library table. I tried
to lift one end of it with my left hand, but failed ;
evidently it
weighed some 80 lbs. Its greatest feat one day was moving across
the whole length of the room, say 12 feet. The little table had
risen bodily from the ground, and struck Dr. Williams in the
chest.
Most of the contactless movements were very brief, as if the
force exhausted itself quickly. Xo one had complained of tiredness
after sitting.
Mrs. Williams testified to the water-splashing reported to Hodgson.
The best way to induce movements without contact had been
to get them first with contact, then reduce the contact to one
finger from each sitter, then take off the fingers, holding the hands
not far, and tell the table to move, when it often would. The
contactless movements were sliding, tipping, and rising bodily.
A few more sittings were held after Dr. Gower's return,
as to which he sent ine brief notes, as follows
:
May mh, 1906.
. . . We have had a sitting, and the results were very promising
—
raps and movements without contact (apparently). . . .
May 25th, 1906.
We had a seance two evenings ago, and I send you just a line
to say that there are still "things doing." Eaps, movements,
etc., without contact, and jumps with contact ; the latter, however,
quite puzzling. . . . Mr. T. and I tried by ourselves to get some-
thing in my room here. We put our hands upon an oak table,
as heavy, if not heavier, than the seance table in your room [i.e.
the S.P.E. rooms], and without casters. We got nothing without
contact, but raps came on the table and on the floor (apparently).
At two other sittings mentioned in Dr. Gower's letters to
me at this time, similar results were obtained. In discussing
the phenomena in general, in view of my proposed visit to
America, he observed
:
June 23rd, 1906.
... It is so easy to make raps without apparent contact that
110 Alice Johnson. [part
it seems impossible to decide for certain that the raps are really
supernormally produced, however keenly one may be observing.
Certain occurrences I have witnessed could not possibly have been
produced by any means known to me, but more frequently it is
possible that they could be. ...
II. My Own Experiences.
I arrived at on August 25th, 1906, and was shortly
introduced to most of the sitters. They all received me
with much kindness and hospitality, especially Dr. and
Mrs. Williams, and did all in their power to give me oppor-
tunities of witnessing the phenomena. Their only objection
to allowing their names to appear in connection with the
case was the fear of newspaper notoriety in their own State.
Any one who has had experience of the idiosyncracies of a
certain section of the American press will sympathise with
this fear.
There is, as already said, no professional medium in the
circle, and no one who is accustomed to go into trance, or
into any kind of abnormal condition during the sittings. But
it is to Mrs. Williams's agency or mediumship that the
phenomena are in Dr. Gower's view chiefly to be attributed,
since the most marked ones have almost always occurred in
her presence, and the movements and raps seem stronger,
the nearer they are to her. Dr. Williams is a Canadian by
birth, and an Edinburgh M.D., who stands at the head of
his profession in the town where they live—a town of over
200,000 inhabitants—and is in request by patients in all
parts of the State. He has recently taken to using hypnotic
suggestion in his practice, and showed me several cases in
which it seemed to have been of great service.
Mrs. Williams—like most women in that part of America
—
spends a great part of her time and energy in household
affairs, on account of the almost complete dearth of domestic
servants. Her mind seemed to be chiefly occupied with her
children and her friends, and the practical details of everyday
life. She took no interest in the sittings, and only consented
to hold them at Dr. Gower's request for my benefit ; she
could not bear to be regarded as a medium. She did not
deny—though she minimised as much as possible—the state-
Liv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. Ill
ments of the other witnesses that movements of the table
had occurred without contact in a way she could not account
for ;
but, she asked, what was the good of that ? It led to
nothing ;
they went on, and they never got any forwarder,
and it was all a stupid and tiresome waste of time. She
thought it extraordinary that I should have come all that
way on the chance of seeing something, but was willing to
hold sittings as I had come. I must add that every one I
met expressed the highest opinion of her general character
and trustworthiness, and what I saw of her led me to take
the same view.
The other sitters were engaged in various businesses or
professions in the town, and with the exception of Dr.
Gower and Dr. Williams, seemed to take little interest in
the sittings. In a rapidly changing and developing place of
this kind, material interests and practical affairs are necessarily
forced into the foreground, and the absence of settled tradi-
tions gives the child-like outlook on life which is typical of
a country where nothing seems impossible, and hardly anything
inappropriate. The obstacles of custom that to us of the
elder nations block the path of all reforms are simply
ignored, or do not exist in such a place. Like the child in
the fairy tale who could not see the Emperor's new clothes,
these Westerners are unable, for instance, to see any difficulty
in women becoming enfranchised citizens of the State as soon
as they come of age. Similarly, it seemed to them the
most natural thing in the world when at a sitting to address
the " controls " in a friendly spirit in the local vernacular
:
" Now, Albert, get busy !
" " See here, Bertie, get up and
dust !
" and so on. The " controls " generally seemed encouraged
and stirred up by this kind of remark, and would act
accordingly.
Altogether, I made the acquaintance of 21 of the sitters
concerned (besides Dr. Gower), not to mention all the tables.
They talked to me freely about the earlier sittings, and though
their accounts did not always agree in every detail, they all
agreed that the extensible pedestal table had opened of itself,
and that the other table had moved across the room and
back again, and? tilted several times, all without being touched.
It did not seem to me that these events had grown in their
112- Alice Johnson. [part
recollection, since what they told me tallied with the brief
records made at the time.
During my visit 18 sittings were held, 11 at the house
of Dr. Williams, 3 at the house of Mrs. B., the owner
of the extensible table, and the other 4 at two other houses.
Dr. Gower and I, of course, attended all these sittings
;
Mrs. Williams was present at the first 12 of them (10 of
which were held at her own house, and 2 at Mrs. B.'s). She
then left the town to stay with her children in the moun-
tains some 80 miles off, and was prevented by a snowstorm
from returning before I had to leave.
Of these twelve sittings with Mrs. Williams, three were
blanks. At the others, abundant raps were heard, both when
the sitters' hands were on the table, and to a less extent
when they were off. Tilts and other movements of the table
occurred in the ordinary way with our hands on the table,
and a few movements apparently without contact, as well as
some levitations which we could not explain.
The sittings were all held in a good light. I did not
attempt to take notes at the time, as I wished to observe
as carefully as possible all that was happening, so I wrote
a full report of each sitting on the day after it was held,
and submitted my report to Dr. Gower, in order that he
might confirm or correct it.
This was not an ideal plan, but it seemed the best possible
under the circumstances. When, as in some experiments, we
want chiefly to know all that was spoken in the course of
them, it is not only comparatively easy but essential to make
a complete record on the spot. In the case of " physical
phenomena," where the first essential is to observe a series
of more or less complicated actions, it is not possible for one
person to do this adequately and to take notes of his observa-
tions at the same time. The reports were therefore written
as soon as possible afterwards.
I will now give some extracts from these reports :
Sitting I.
Monday, Aug. 27/06, 8.30—11.30 p.m., at the house of
Dr. Williams.
Present: Dr. and Mrs. Williams, Dr. Gower, Mr. T., Mr. and Mrs. P.,
Liv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 113
Mrs. E., Mrs. B., and A. J. Also Miss R. (aunt of Mrs. Williams),
who sat away from the table all the time.
Dr. Gower played on the piano for a few minutes before we
began. Mrs. Williams and Mr. T. brought the table from a corner
of the room into the middle. They told me it was the table most
often used at their sittings. It was a heavy, oblong table —some
4 to 5 ft. long, and 2 to 3 ft. wide—with four straight legs, one at
each corner, on casters, and a ledge below, about 10 inches from
the floor. It had no cloth on. The room was lighted by a
brilliant incandescent gas burner, [connected with] a chandelier
(which also contained electric lights) in the middle of the room,
the gas burner being placed on a small table near the seance
table. During part of the evening one of these electric lights was
turned on for a short time, and then off again, and then an
electric light in the next room was turned on for a time. This
room opened into the seance room by a wide archway, over which
curtains were drawn part of the time. The main light throughout
was from the gas burner, which was full on all the time, and it
was ample for all purposes. The only difficulty about seeing arose
from the fact that the table necessarily prevented one's seeing the
lower part of the body of most of the sitters. . . .
We began by sitting round the table with our hands on it.
Before long raps were heard apparently in the table. They were
not at all loud—sometimes only just audible —and sounded rather
like a finger nail tapping gently on the table. They were fairly
frequent, and answered to questions by rapping once for " no," and
thrice for " yes " ; also gave any number that was asked for. In
answer to questions they said a spirit was present—a man—but
would not give his name or any other particulars.
We took all our hands off the table, and sat round without touch-
ing it at all, and the raps came again just as before, apparently in
the table. I could not detect any difference in the quality of the
sounds, and they showed an equal amount of intelligence
—
i.e.
answered questions by one or three raps, and gave the numbers
required.
Part of the time we stood round the table holding our linked
hands above it, and without touching it at all. I think raps
occurred under these circumstances, but I am not now quite certain,
as I cannot remember all the details and order of events.
We also got movements of the table, both with and without contact.
All these movements were of the same nature, viz., backwards
H
114 Alice Johnson. [part
and forwards, and sideways—all the legs remaining on the floor
all the time ; there was no tilting. When we touched the table,
we were supposed to be touching it witb our hands only, which
were laid flat on the top of it.
The movements without contact occurred, I think, three or four
times—generally very soon after there had been a movement with con-
tact. They came rather suddenly, the table being on these occasions
jerked once or twice over a space of perhaps three or four inches,
and then stopping dead. During these movements the hands of
the sitters were held in the air over the table, —I think at least
three inches from its surface, —and on at least one occasion, we
were standing—not sitting—round it.
I feel practically certain that these movements were not produced
by the hands of any of the sitters ; but I coidd not tell what
their legs were doing, as they Avere hidden from me by the table.
I watched as carefully as was possible under the circumstances,
and saw nothing in the least suspicious during any part of the
evening.
We tried in vain to get a small pencil, which was placed on
the middle of the table, moved.
Later, after an interval, we tried again with a small, light
square fourdegged table, which easily moved and tilted and twisted
itself round so as to balance on one leg, and then gave a sort of
jump into the air, coming down on all its legs. It was impossible
to be sure, however, that all the legs had really been off the
floor simultaneously, and all these movements took place with
contact.
On the whole, though the conditions were so inconclusive that
no stress could be laid on anything that occurred, I felt it decidedly
encouraging that we had got any phenomena at all at this first
sitting.
The above account was written between 1 and 4.30 p.m. on
Tuesday, Aug. 28/06.

Wednesday, Aug. 29/06, about 9 —11 p.m., at the house of
Dr. Williams. •
Present: Dr. and Mrs. Williams, Dr. Gower, Mrs. T. W., and
A. J. ;
later, Mr. T. Miss R. was also present, but took no part
in the sitting.
Liv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 115
Same table used as at first sitting. Mrs. Williams measured
it, and found it to be 4 ft. long by 2-i- ft. wide. It is made of
solid oak, with a drawer at each end.
The light used was the incandescent gas burner, placed on a
smaller table. After some music we sat in the positions shown
[in a diagram not reproduced here] with our hands on the table.
Soon raps were heard, apparently in the table. They were faint,
and sometimes barely audible ; when a little louder they sounded
to me like small drops of water falling on the table.
A small pencil was put on the table, and we requested that it
might be moved without the table being moved. The request was
made at intervals several times, but the pencil was not moved.
The raps answered to questions as before, the questions and
remarks addressed to the " spirits " being made generally by
Dr. Gower. After a little time, on his asking what spirit was
present, the name " Robert Rowed " was rapped out. Mrs. Williams
said: "Is that you, Bob?" and it rapped "yes."
Dr. Williams said :
" Ask him how many years he has been
dead," and the answer came by raps: "Three." Mrs. Williams
said she thought that was right, and appealed to Miss R. to say
whether it was not. Miss R. thought he had died about three
years ago last Christmas.
On being asked if there was any message for anybody, the raps
gave " Tell Emily (here Mrs. Williams remarked that " Emily
"
was right) all well don't worry."
Dr. Williams said: "Ask him where he died," and the raps
gave "Sey." Here Mrs. Williams said that was right—the name
of the place being Seymore.
Mrs. Williams told us that Robert Rowed was a man who had
lived near her old home (in Canada ?) and had been engaged to
a cousin of hers, named Emily. He had died of typhoid fever
about three months before he was to have been married. She had
not thought of who was meant until the full name was given, as he
had always been called "Bob," not "Robert." She gave us his
full history.
Dr. Gower said afterwards that he had been much surprised by
the interest she manifested in this message, as he had never before
seen her take any interest in jany of the messages they had got
—
even in the first one, which purported to come from her father,
and gave the name of some place connected with him. On this
occasion she spoke to the " control " quite as if she imagined
116 Alice Johnson. [part
him to be really there. She would not ask questions herself, but
sat with her eyes closed listening attentively, but in a perfectly
composed manner, to the raps, and nodded as each correct state-
ment came.
Nothing more came from Robert Rowed. The next " control
"
began to announce himself as " Alb
—" and on being asked if he
was " Albert Shaw " answered " yes." We then attempted to get
movements. The table moved a little backwards and forwards with
contact. Then we took our hands off and stood up round it, and
it moved once—a distance of about 2 inches —from Mrs. Williams
towards me. She was standing very close to it, but apparently
not touching it. Dr. Williams suggested we should stand further
off, and she moved back a little, [but] it did not move again. We
then sat down again [but got nothing more except a few raps
and sideways movements of the table with contact].
Sitting V,
Friday, Aug. 31/06, about 9—10.30 p.m., at Dr. Williams's house.
Present: Mrs. Williams, Dr. Gower, and A. J. Miss R. also in
room, not taking part in sitting.
Li°;ht from incandescent tras burner as before. We sat first
round the small light four-legged table, with ledge below. By
sitting back and looking down I could see the legs of the table.
We put our hands on the table and raps soon came on it. They
next came on Mrs. Williams's chair. The chair was a solid wooden
one with stuffed seat, as represented [in the diagram].
The raps seeming to proceed from it, I put my head
against the back to listen and heard them clearly as
if struck on the front surface of the back. I asked
Mrs. Williams to sit forward so that I could put my
head between her and the back of the chair. She did
so and I listened again with my face towards her back
and heard the raps on the back of the chair as before.
They came in quick succession, sometimes in little runs almost as
quick as fingers playing a succession of notes on a piano. I listened
also with my ear against the wooden side of the seat of the chair
and then against one of the back legs and the raps seemed about the
same. I could not tell exactly in what part of the chair they were.
Mrs. Williams then changed places with me, and the raps came again
in the chair in which she was then sitting. This chair was made
entirely of wood, with wooden seat and arms. After a little while
Liv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 117
we put a large soft cushion into it for her to sit on and another
large soft cushion on the floor, on which she placed her feet.
I then listened to the raps with my ear against various parts of the
chair on Mrs. Williams's left-hand side, and finally went down on
the floor and passed my left hand up and down the front leg of
the chair on that side to make sure that nothing was knocking
against it. The raps continued while I was doing this. I then got
my right arm between the lower bars of the chair (the legs being
connected by three or four bars) to feel the right front chair leg.
I found the cushion was being pressed hard against this by what I
supposed was the heel of Mrs. Williams's right foot. I felt this
being moved backwards and forwards several times, pressing hard
against my hand—through the cushion—each time it moved back.
For a moment I thought that Mrs. Williams might be trying to
rap on the chair with this foot ;
[but] the movements I detected could
not apparently have made the raps, because the cushion was
between the foot and the leg of the chair all the time. There
remains the possibility that before I felt these movements, the foot
might have been lifted clear of the cushion and have been knocking
on the chair leg, as the raps ceased before I felt the movements.
That is, I heard no raps while I was controlling both legs of the
chair. I think it most likely, however, that Mrs. Williams was
merely pressing her foot on the ground automatically, as she was
sitting with her arms extended and her hands being held by Dr.
Gower off the table, and I do not think the movements of the foot
had any significance in connection with the raps.
Dr. Gower told me that while this was going on he heard raps
at the same time both on the table and on Mrs. Williams's chair,
and that the table moved slightly two or three times without con-
tact. I saw and heard nothing of the table at this time, as I was
occupied with attending to the chair.
The raps on the chair having ceased, I got up and returned to
my seat on Mrs. Williams's left hand, and we all again put our
hands on the table. We got a little tilting and movements of the
table with contact, but none without, though we tried lifting our
hands several times. We also got raps—rather faint ones—on the
table, sometimes with and sometimes without contact. 1
Mrs.
Williams still sat with her feet on the cushion, and I could see a

clear space between her skirt and the table most of the time. I
think that the raps without contact occurred more than once while
I was seeing this space between her and the table ; but the
phenomena now seemed to be becoming gradually weaker. . . .
P.S. —Near the beginning of the sitting we tried to make the
raps on Mrs. Williams's first chair give certain numbers. Dr. Gower
whispered "4" to me, and asked if "it" would rap the number. It
rapped once, perhaps meaning "no," and on being asked again
rapped 4 times. He then wrote down the number 8 without showing
it to anybody, and 8 raps came. I then wrote down 5, and it
rapped first 7, and when I said that was wrong, it rapped 5.
Then I wrote down 10, and it made two wrong guesses.
Twice while the raps were going on, Dr. Grower went away to
answer the telephone, and the raps continued while he was away.

Read and endorsed. I would add that I was more impressed
with the creaking and straining of the table to which Miss Johnson
refers, as it continued for some time, and I felt convinced nothing
was in contact with the table.

Sitting VII.
Sunday, Sep. 2/06, about 6—7.30 p.m., at Dr. Williams's house.
Present : Mrs. Williams, Dr. Gower, and A. J. Miss R. also
there, not taking part in sitting.
We sat by firedight—no other light in the room—but the fire
was large and burning brightly. [I was sitting near the fire, which
was behind me and to my left, as shown in the diagram in my
notes], so that I could see the legs of the table specially well.
We used the small light table. Raps (with contact) soon came on
it, announcing the presence of " Albert Shaw, " who promised to do
his best for us. Mrs. Williams was sitting on a wooden chair with
stuffed seat and no arms. We put a cushion for her to sit on and
another cushion for her feet, and asked the raps to come on her
chair. They did so, and I went down on the floor at her right
side to listen for them with my ear against her chair. They
seemed first to sound on the floor under the table, but soon were
undoubtedly on Mrs. Williams's chair. I felt round the front chair
leg nearest to me and found nothing pressing against it. Then I
put my other arm under the chair to feel the other front chair leg.
Against this, something—presumably Mrs. Wdliams's left foot—was
Liv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 119
moving backwards and forwards and up and down, so as to rub the
cushion up and down against it. This appeared to make sounds
like the raps we had been hearing, but I did not manage to get my
ear pressed close against the chair at the same time that I was
feeling the movements, so that I did not exactly hear the raps
synchronising with them. I put my left hand round the distant
front chair leg so as to prevent the foot knocking and rubbing
on it. The foot seemed, as it were, to try a little longer to reach
the leg; then, finding itself prevented, left off and apparently moved
forward and immediately afterwards Dr. Gower remarked that the
raps had now come on the table. I asked that they should come
back to the chair, and remained in the same position for a few
minutes waiting for them. As they did not come, I returned to
my seat.
We then tried to get raps and movements of the table without con-
tact. We got some raps —I do not remember whether with or without
contact. We got one movement of the table when our hands were
clear of it; the leg between Mrs. W. and Dr. Gower moving about
2 ins. from her towards him. He was looking down at it, and said
that he could see a clear space on the floor between this leg and
the cushion on which her feet were resting. I could not see this
space, because of the lower ledge of the table. I could see, how-
ever, that the table leg on Mrs. Williams's other side was in contact
with the cushion, and when Dr. G. and I tried afterwards by our-
selves, it seemed to us that it might have been possible to push
the cushion against this leg in such a way as to produce the
movement.
After an interval, Mrs. Williams and I changed places, and the
table then began to move (with contact) and tilt. It then got up
on to one leg, the one nearest to her left hand, and after balancing
on it for a little while, gave a sudden jump and came clown on
the other legs. The thing was done so quickly that it was impos-
sible to say whether all four legs were off the ground at once, but
I do not believe they were. The table moved and tilted a little
further, but nothing more of any importance happened.
After this evening's experience, I cannot doubt that Mrs.
AVilliams sometimes makes raps with her feet and probably some-
times also with her hands. At one time in the evening—I forget
whether before or after the raps on her chair described above —we
were getting raps on the table without contact, i.e. with our
120 Alice Johnson. [part
hands not touching it. But her skirt was in contact with one
leg. I moved the table so as leave a clear space of about 2 ins.
between it and her skirt, and no more raps came. It seems to
me, however . . . that she is entirely unconscious of making any
movements that have anything to do with the phenomena.
Further, nothing that I have observed could account for the
more striking phenomena of movements without contact that have
been described to me by the other witnesses.

Sitting VIII.
Monday, Sep. 3/06, about 9 to 12 p.m. at Dr. Williams's house.
Present : Mrs. Williams, Dr. Gower, Mrs. B., Mr. and Mrs. W.,
and A. J. Miss B. also there, taking no part in sitting.
We sat first at the large table ; the incandescent gas-lamp on
the table behind Mrs. B. Dr. Gower tried knocking on different
parts of the table to get the musical tones of the various parts, so
as to judge, when the raps came, on which part they were. He
found different tones for the top, legs and lower ledge, on which
were a number of large books and papers.
Baps came soon—apparently on the floor—then on the table
—
apparently on its lower ledge. They also came occasionally, I think,
on its surface. They occasionally answered "yes" and "no" to ques-
tions, but refused to give any name or message. They also came
on Mrs. Williams's chair. Dr. Gower got up and listened with his
ear against the back and then against the side of the chair, and
said they appeared to be on it. He then came back to the table.
We lifted our hands off it and stood up round it. Baps still came
on it, but apparently on the lower ledge, not the surface. We
tried several times to get the raps on the surface of the table
without contact, also on other people's chairs, but they came only on
Mrs. Williams's chair, and only, I think, when she was sitting on it.
My impression at the time was that she was unconsciously making
all these raps; they all seemed to be in her immediate neighbour-
hood. She appeared to be listening to them with the same curiosity
and interest as the rest of us. From time to time one or other of
us was aware of making some noise which the others might take
for raps, and would then make such remark as "I did that." She
too now and then remarked that some sound was made by herself,
and she seemed to me to say this whenever she knew that she was
Liv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 121
producing a sound. I think the sounds she made consciously were
. . . a little different from those which, as I believe, she made
unconsciously. . . .
Sitting IX.
Tuesday, Sep. 4/06, about 9 —11-30 p.m., at Dr. Williams's house.
Present: Mrs. Williams, Dr. Gower, W. T., Judge H., and A. J.
Also Mrs. H. and Miss R., sitting away from table and taking-
no part.
We sat at the large heavy table. The incandescent gas lamp
was lit ; also two electric lights in the central chandelier were
on. We put our hands on the table and soon got raps in it.
We took our hands off and the raps continued. Occasionally
they showed intelligence—such as answering "yes" or "no," or
giving a number, but gave no name or message. While they were
going on and we were sitting with our hands off the table, I leant
back and managed to see the outline of Mrs. Williams's knees
against an illuminated part of the floor in front of Dr. Gower.
[I was on her right side and Dr. Gower at the end of the table
on her left.] I saw her left knee moving up and down very
slightly in time with the raps. The movement was so slight that
I was not always sure of it, but several times I saw as many as
five or six movements in succession synchronising with the same
number of raps. I did not always see a movement at the same
time that I heard a rap, but as far as I remember, I never
saw a movement during this period without hearing a rap.
From the sound of these raps, I did not feel certain that they
were on the table, but the other sitters seemed to have no doubt
on this point. If they were right, I think Mrs. Williams probabh'
made the raps by knocking her left foot against the leg of the
table nearest to her or possibly by rubbing her shin against the
ledge of the table ; there being no clear space visible between her
skirt and these parts of the table.
I believe she was quite unconscious of doing this, as I think
she must have been aware that I was watching her closely ; but
meanwhile the movements went on, and she showed not the slightest
sign of self-consciousness.
Throughout the evening we got raps, with our hands sometimes
on and sometimes off the table, but never with a clear space between
Mrs. Williams's skirt and the. object on which the raps appeared
to be made. . . .

Friday, Sep. 7/06, about 9—11 p.m., at Dr. Williams's house.
Present : Dr. and Mrs. Williams, Dr. Gower, and A. J. Also Miss
R. taking no part, and George Williams—aged about 14—who was
reading and now and then came to look on at what the table
was doing, but did not touch it at all. The light was stronger
than usual, two electric lamps in the central chandelier being on,
as well as the incandescent gas lamp on the table.
Mrs. Williams, Dr. Gower, and I sat round the small light table
;
Dr. Williams sitting a little distance off, first in the place shown
—
later on the window seat behind and to the rierht of Mrs. Williams.

Dr. Williams did not touch the table at any time, but confined
himself to making suggestions to it to perform certain movements,
addressing it as he would one of Ids patients, with whom he uses
hypnotic suggestion extensively.
At first, however, Dr. Gower talked to it as usual, asking for
raps, which came pretty freely, apparently on the surface of the
table ;
they were never very loud, but sometimes quite clear.
They would not answer questions, but rapped three times when
Dr. Gower asked if "it" wished to be left alone to do what it
could.
We got strong movements and tilting, but only with contact, 1
Dr.
Williams repeatedly urging the table to rise completely off the floor.
Then raps came again, apparently on Mrs. Williams's chair, which
was the wooden one with a stuffed seat and no arms. Dr. Williams
went round to her right side to listen to these raps, and moved
the chair a little forward, to prevent it touching the wall behind
1

and so avoid the possibility of her making sounds by pressing it
against the wall. She sat forwards in the chair with a considerable
space between her back and its back, and turned towards Dr.
Gower, stretching out both her feet in that direction between the
leg of the table and the fireplace. She said that her feet were
crossed, and I understood afterwards from Dr. Gower that he could
see that they were so. I could not see this from my place ; but
it appeared to me that her feet were stretched out so much to her
left that they could not have been in contact with the leg of her
chair, and I think there was a clear space between them and the
adjoining table leg. Under these conditions raps sounded on her
chair.
There were also raps on the table both with our hands on and
with our hands off it. When our hands were off, however, Mrs.
Williams's skirt was generally in contact with the table leg on her
right, and on the occasions when there was not this contact, I was
not absolutely satisfied that the raps were in the table. She often
drew her skirt away from it ; but then in the natural course of
events the table would again approach the skirt, or the skirt the
table, [for] with our hands on the table it tilted strongly, getting
further and further away from her as it did so. At last she would
hardly be able to keep her hands on it, and as she leant forward
to do so, her skirt naturally went forward too. We often tried
lifting our hands off it, but could never get any movement to
start with the hands off, and so had to keep the table constantly
near us.
We then tried with our hands on it to make it get up on to one
leg, and jump off that leg, Dr. Williams making strong suggestions to
that effect. After a good deal of thumping, wriggling and twisting it
stood on the leg nearest to Mrs. Williams's right hand, balanced back
and forth on it for some time, Dr. Williams adjuring it to jump, then
suddenly gave a great jump on to the diagonal!}' opposite leg.
This happened so quickly that it was impossible
to see exactly what happened. We urged it to Mb Wiwams
repeat the performance, and it did so. As before A B

it stood waving and balancing itself on the le°-
nearest to Mrs. Williams's right hand (A). [See
diagram.] Then suddenly this leg flew up into

to where the first leg had stood, the table balancing for half a

second or so on this second leg, before the other three legs fell
to the floor.
Both Dr. Williams and the boy George, who was lying on the
floor near the leg D watching the table, declared that they could
see the legs B and C off the ground while this jump was taking
place. Dr. Grower and I could not see this, but it must have been
so from the fact of D falling on to a place so close to where A
had been immediately before. The table did not simply fall from
A on to the other legs, but swung through the arc of a circle,
and must for a moment have been completely off the floor.
The only normal means, as far as I could see, by which this
could have been done, was by [a] foot or feet' getting under the
ledge of the table and heaving or kicking it up. 1
It appeared
throughout the evening both to Dr. Govver and myself that the
movements of the table were mainly produced by the unconscious
muscular action of Mrs. Williams's hands, which seemed to respond
forcibly to Dr. Williams's suggestions to the table. It would seem,
therefore, not unnatural that her feet should respond unconsciously too.
The only question is whether she could have done this without our
seeing it. The boy was in the best position for seeing her feet,
as he was lying on the floor, and I think he would have called out
to her or given some sign if he had seen anything. Probably he
was not looking out specially for any movement on her part, but
he was watching the table legs intently. [The sitters] were not
in such a favourable position for seeing ;
[though] I was looking
under the table. . . . Both [Dr. Gower and I, however,] were
watching as carefully as possible, and neither of us detected any
movement [by the sitters]. But I cannot feel quite certain that
we should have seen it if [it had occurred].
After this Dr. Williams suggested to the table to get up on
one leg on to the corner of a large long foot-stool in front of the
window seat. It did this after a good deal of wriggling and
waving about, and remained for some time balanced on one leg
on the most extreme point of one corner of the foot-stool with its
surface practically horizontal and its other three legs in the air,
some six inches from the ground. It not only stood there, but also
wriggled about a good deal in its efforts to follow Dr. Williams's
next suggestion and get another leg up on to Mrs. Williams's chair
or on to the large arm-chair which was standing near. It must
have required very delicate [balancing] for it to do this without
1

slipping off the corner of the foot-stool, which was made of a
wooden frame with a stuffed top. The table was supported on a
corner of the stuffing, not of the wood. . . . Finally the table
tumbled down on to the floor.
A similar performance was repeated at Dr. Williams's request,
the table getting up on one leg on to the foot-stool, but further
from the edge of it, then on another leg on to the window seat,
where it remained tilting for some time, with our hands on it, till
we brought it down.
Dr. Williams then went out for about half-an-hour. While he was
away, Mrs. Williams and Dr. Gower and I continued sitting in the
same positions as before. George was now sitting some three or
four feet from the table—and certainly not touching it at all —to the
right of and slightly behind Dr. Gower, and fully in my view.
We three sat with our hands on the table, talking, but not making
any direct suggestion to it. Dr. Gower was relating how at [a
house in England] he had seen a table levitated, when suddenly the
table, which had been motionless, rose clear off the ground, straight
up, remaining in a horizontal position all the time. It rose, I
judged, some 5 or 6 ins., lifting our hands, which were lying flat
on the surface, with it, and then went straight down again. George
said he saw three legs off the ground, the fourth being invisible to
him ; but we none of us doubted that they were all four up at
once for a moment.
We were not expecting this movement as we had been expecting
the jumps of the table described before (pp. 123-4), and therefore were
not watching [the table] immediately before it happened. But we
looked at [each other] immediately on its happening, and again did
not detect any movement whatever of . . . knees or body. We could
not see [each other's feet], as they were hidden by the ledge of
the table, and again the only possible normal way of raising the
table seemed to be by [one of us] lifting the ledge with [a] foot or feet.
[Mrs. Williams's] skirt was close up to the ledge ; it would have
been easier to do it with [one's] feet crossed, but I do not think
[the feet of any of us] were crossed, as I think it would have
been visible if they had been. The table seemed to go up
with considerable force. This struck Dr. Gower more than
it did me. He told me afterwards 1
that his hands were pressing
heavily on the table, and he was much surprised at the force with
which it was lifted up against this pressure ; also that he saw Mrs.

126 Alice Johnson. [part
Williams's face turned towards him with an expression of great
astonishment as the table lifted. I did not see her face, as I was
looking at the lower part of her body.
I then suggested to her that she and I should both put our feet
on the foot-stool, to make sure that we were not touching the
table with our feet. We did so and tried to get the table to move
up again, but no further movements took place. . . .

Note 1. —The raps were sometimes made when the hands were
upon the table, and sometimes when the hands were not touch-
ing it,
At one time, early in the sitting, when the raps were occurring,
I asked for a movement of the table to be made without contact.
Two distinct movements were made in response, and so far as I
could see, without contact, or such contact as would have been
necessary to produce the movement. By this I mean that the leg
and side of the table which moved the greater distance were quite
clear, but on the opposite side a skirt may have been touching
the leg. But Miss Johnson was in a better position for observing
this latter point than I was.
Note 2. —My recollection is that at the time the table made the
jump we, i.e., Miss Johnson, Mrs. Williams, and myself, were stand-
ing up. Considering that Dr. Williams on the one side, and
George on the other side, in addition to Miss Johnson and
myself, were at the time watching carefully and expectantly the
various movements of the table, I doubt if the feet of any of the
sitters could have been brought in contact with the table without
being at once noticed.
Note 3 —Such was the force manifested in this movement of the
table that I think it would have required both feet to have pro-
duced it, especially as my hands were resting so heavily upon my
side of the table that it would have turned over unless supported
underneath by more than one foot ;
but, as a matter of fact, the
top of the table remained level, and my hands were fairly forced
up with the table.
Next morning (to-day) I questioned George closely as to what
he observed, and he said he could see clearly underneath the table,
and nobody's feet were there.

Note by A. J. on levitations of small table on Sep. 7th.
September 13th, 1906.
On Sep. 10th Dr. Gower and I alone tried experiments with
this table, which we then measured. The top is 17| ins. x 17| ins.
The lower ledge is 12 ins. x 12 ins. and about § in. thick. Its
lower surface is 9| ins. from the floor [see
diagram]. The distance between the lower ends
of diagonally opposite legs is 2 ft. We wrote
down these measurements (except the thickness
of the ledge) at the time.
We each tried lifting the table by putting
our feet under the ledge. It is of course
much easier to lift it horizontally if the
hands are placed on the top so as to keep it balanced. Under
these circumstances, it does not matter to which point of the ledge
the foot is applied, as the hands can keep the balance in any
case. But if the hands press much on the table it is very difficult
to lift it with the foot ; I could not do so while Dr. Gower was
pressing on it about as much as he thought he did at the sitting
(when his impression was that a considerable force was lifting the
table in opposition to the weight of his hands on it), and he could
only do it with great difficulty while I pressed on it. But if the
person who tried to lift the table crossed his legs, it was then
much easier to lift it. In any case, however, it appeared hardly
possible that if the table had been lifted by such means we should
have failed to detect it, as when we did it in this way our move-
ments were so very obvious to each other. We were of course
looking out for each other's movements, but then we were also
looking out at the sitting for movements . . . and we saw none.
We believed that [the sitters'] legs were not crossed at the time, and
that consequently a great effort would have been necessary to
lift the table.
Dr. Gower tells me that he cross-examined George more than
once as to what he saw of the sitters' feet ; that he declared they
were all sitting with their feet back—not under the table at all
—
that he could see the ends of his mother's shoes, and that no one
moved at all.
We tried also to make the table jump from one leg on to the
diagonally opposite one by lifting the ledge with our feet. We
did not manage to make the opposite leg alight on a spot close
128 Alice Johnson. [part
to where the first one had been resting (as happened at the sitting),
but probably this could be done with practice. The performance
seemed very clumsy as compared with what happened at the sitting,
and it seemed even more difficult than in the case of the horizontal
lifting to suppose that it could have been done [deliberately by]
normal means without detection.
Nevertheless I am not satisfied that these experiments reproduce
the conditions of a sitting sufficiently for purposes of exact
comparison. ... I do not think they prove conclusively that
there is no automatic action of a kind [more effective than any
that] could be deliberately and consciously produced.
After the twelfth sitting Mrs. Williams left the town to
join her [children who were staying in the mountains, so that
we had unfortunately no further opportunities of experiments
with her. Six more sittings were held after her departure
at the houses of various members of the circle. No move-
ments without contact occurred, nor were there any levitations
of the table. It is noteworthy, however, that at all these
sittings raps were obtained, though only (with one doubtful
exception) when the sitters' hands were resting on the table
on which the raps sounded. If, therefore, I am right in
attributing these raps to the automatic action of the sitters,
it would seem that Mrs. Williams was not the only one
who had acquired the faculty for making them in this
manner.
III. General Discussion of Evidence.
In considering the reports quoted above it may perhaps
be not out of place to make a few remarks on the character
of evidence for " physical phenomena " in general. There is,
I believe, a rather widely-spread opinion that the Society for
Psychical Eesearch has a special bias against this subject,
and it is no doubt true that the Proceedings contains more
negative than positive evidence on it. But, though every
one must admit that—from the nature of the case—it must
be easier to prove fraud, where fraud exists, than to prove
any kind of genuine supernormal occurrence, few persons seem
to grasp what are the special difficulties in the way of proving
physical phenomena.
liv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 129
At first sight it might be supposed, and in fact it is generally
supposed, that physical phenomena are more demonstrable
than psychical phenomena, since the former can be perceived
by all the persons present, and the latter, as a rule, are only
perceptible to one, so that we have to depend on his state-
ment as to what has happened to him.
If, however, we are considering the evidence for a case
of telepathy—say, when an apparition is seen at the time
of death of the person represented—the statement of the
percipient, if made at the time of his experience, is all that
we want. In making it, he is describing the only kind of
event of which he can have any direct knowledge, viz., an
impression produced on his consciousness. Supposing, there-
fore, that he is speaking the truth about this impression, the
statement may be taken as absolutely and literally correct.
From the point of view of evidence for telepathy, it is not even
very important whether he is speaking the truth or not ; he
may not have had a sensory impression, but only a vague
idea ; or he may have invented the whole thing. The point
is that he should have made the statement at the time to one
or more persons equally ignorant with himself of the death.
If there were a large number of cases in which such state-
ments had been made at the time of deaths, and at such
times only, we should consider it practically certain that there
was some causal connection between the deaths and the
statements—something that made people make such statements
at such times.
The evidence for such cases of telepathy then is of the
simplest possible kind ; that is, there are comparatively few
steps in the argument, and in consequence comparatively few
opportunities for flaws.
The evidence for physical phenomena, on the other hand,
is far more complicated, and consequently affords far more
opportunities for error. Here it is not a question of what
impressions were produced on people's minds, but what objective
effects were produced in the material world outside them. If
the witnesses are veracious, and accustomed to observe their
own mental impressions, they can tell us what these were.
The external events they can of course only infer from their
mental impressions ;
they have no direct knowledge of them,
i
130 Alice Johnson. [part
and may be entirely mistaken about them. There are thus
a number of alternative possibilities as to what the external
events were :
(1) They may have happened as described.
(2) They may have been purely hallucinatory, as when
hallucinatory figures are seen at seances.
(3) They may have been positively illusory, e.g. an object
may be seen to move when it is really standing
still.
(4) Negative hallucinations may occur ; i.e. a person may
entirely fail to see an object fully within his field
of vision.
(5) Negative illusions may occur; i.e. some movement may
be made which the observer absolutely overlooks, as
in the case of many conjuring tricks.
All these defects of perception are known to be more or
less common, and we are accustomed to making more or less
allowance for them in ordinary life ;
yet how little allowance
is, as a rule, made for them in judging the evidence for
physical phenomena. In such cases the usual comment is :
" I shall believe so-and-so when I see it, but not before,"
Of course, the mere fact of seeing a thing oneself would by
no means afford adecpaate ground for believing it. We all
know that our senses may be deceived, and we do not, as
a matter of fact, believe anything because we have seen it
;
we believe it because we have seen it, or things consistent
with it many times before, or because we have heard other
people say they have seen it. If any one saw a cow jump
over the moon, he would believe that his senses had deceived
him. If he saw a cow jump over a gate, he would believe
that he had met with an unusually active cow. Yet, the
impression on his consciousness might be of precisely the
same nature in both cases.
Another common argument is to this effect :
" Why not
believe in objects being moved without contact ? That would
not be more wonderful and mysterious than an object being
moved with contact. We do not understand in the least how
the latter is done ;
why then should we not believe in the
possibility of the former ?
" This may be sound, but it appears
to me quite irrelevant. The credibility or non-credibility of
liv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 131
a thing does not depend at all on how wonderful it is ; it
depends on how rare it is. The burden of proof must lie
with those who wish to maintain the genuineness of any
facts unrecognised by science, and we are bound to demand
—
and in practice we always do demand—much more evidence
for alleged facts which are both rarely reported and inconsistent
with ordinary experience than for facts of common kinds. As
Professor Eichet observed in 1893 in his first report on
Eusapia Paladino, " The evidence that I have to offer would
be ample for an experiment in chemistry ; it does not suffice
for an experiment in spiritism."
1 feel the same about the evidence for the reality of the
physical phenomena in this case ;
—it appears to me that other
explanations of the reported movements without contact are
not excluded in an absolutely conclusive manner,—especially
the explanation of negative illusion, according to which the
actions that produced the movements of the tables were on
some occasions overlooked, so that, on these occasions, the
tables appeared to the sitters to have moved of themselves.
This hypothesis is to a certain extent supported by my own
observations of the apparently unconscious production of raps
by some of the sitters.
I speak of the production of raps as unconscious and
automatic, because I personally am convinced of the good
faith of all the sitters, but this of course must to outsiders
be an opinion that requires justification. The same plea
has frequently been urged by spiritualists as an excuse
for what the plain man would call fraud, and we
have frequently been blamed for not having yet
discovered this simple explanation of it. There is, however,
nothing really novel in the notion that people are not
responsible for their actions. It dates back, in fact, to the
garden of Eden. In that case one of the two personages of
the story put down his action to " the woman whom Thou
gavest to be with me." The other, on being asked for an
explanation, said "The serpent beguiled me." These two
alternatives have between them practically held the field
since ; one hardly knows which of them has been the more
popular.
Similarly, some spiritualists are wont to say that when a
132 Alice Johnson. [part
medium cheats, it is due either to the sitters or to the
Serpent. If the sitters belong to the S.P.E., it would of
course be the sitters ; otherwise it is probably the Serpent.
We have added a third alternative, the Subliminal Self, whose
claims now fall to be considered.
In analysing any mediumistic phenomenon such as the
production of raps, we find several different aspects, which
must be treated separately if we are to avoid a hopeless
confusion of thought. There is first the objective aspect
:
by what means were the raps produced ? In the case here
considered, it seemed to me clear that at least some of them
were produced by the muscular action of the sitters. Assuming
this, there is next the subjective aspect, which includes two
:
(1) The psychological question of whether the sitters were
normally conscious of their muscular actions, or whether they
were initiated and carried out subliminally.
(2) The ethical question of their moral responsibility for
their actions.
The moral character of a medium concerns us only in
so far as it affords a certain amount of evidence for or
against the genuineness of the phenomena, for it cannot be
too strongly insisted on that our business is to form a
scientific judgment about the phenomena,—not a moral
judgment about the medium ; so that any question of charity
in our judgment would be out of place.
As to the psychological question of whether a given action
is performed consciously or not, I think that all those who
have studied trance conditions are agreed that no test can
show whether a person is in a trance ; that is, whether
his supraliminal consciousness is in abeyance or not. But
students of the trance acquire after long observation the
conviction that the trance in certain cases is genuine
and not simulated, though the signs by which they are
guided are so minute and indefinable that they could not be
put clown in black and white, or demonstrated to people who
were not familiar with them. And expert observers almost
always, I think, agree in their opinion as to whether a given
trance is genuine or not.
It is of course more difficult to judge whether writing or
table-tilting is being done automatically or not, because then, as
liv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 133
a rule, the supraliminal consciousness is only partly in abeyance,
and the signs of the condition are still slighter. Still we find
by observing a good many cases, that the behaviour of all
persons under these conditions shows certain common character-
istics which it is by no means easy deliberately to put on
—
partly no doubt because it is so difficult to formulate what
they are. I can only say then that by comparing the case
here discussed with other cases which I have seen, it seemed
clear to me that the movements associated with the raps were
automatic.
It seems possible, moreover, to define roughly the kinds
of cases to which this explanation should be restricted.
They are those where there is strong positive ground for
confidence in the honesty and integrity of the medium ; and
where the phenomenon is of a kind that does not require
preparation—either in the way of long practice or of apparatus.
Thus, the case of Eusapia Paladino has a certain superficial
resemblance to this case, but differs from it in that it is well
known (1) that the general character of the medium is entirely
untrustworthy, (2) that the fraud most clearly proved against
her—viz. making one hand or foot do duty for two, and so
getting one free—is a well-known trick, her extraordinary
adeptness in which showed that she must have practised it
for a long time.
We cannot, however, determine a priori whether the sub-
liminal self might not carry out an elaborate series of actions
of this kind involving practice. We have to study what
people in abnormal states of mind actually do. Let us take
first fixed ideas or obsessions which only affect a limited part
of the personality, leaving the rest normal. These ideas may
be more or less complicated, but they seldom lead to any
positive and definite course of action. Motor impulses of a
corresponding kind are generally very simple—such as habits
of twitching certain muscles. Going to the other extreme of
multiple and alternating personalities, we do find complicated
actions performed by different personalities ; but these are not
restricted to certain types, for the secondary personality affects
the whole mind and character, not an isolated group of actions.
Thus, there is the classic case of Louis Vive, who in his
chief secondary condition " preached radicalism in politics
134 Alice Johnson. [part
and atheism in religion," while in his more normal state
he is reported to have been quite a respectable person.
This is comprehensible and credible. But we find among the
records of secondary personality no parallel for the medium
who was said, while in a trance condition, to have automati-
cally bought drapery for making up materialised forms,
automatically concealed it in the back of a chair specially
adapted for the purpose, and subliminally provided himself
with chuckers-out for every sitting. Persons in a trance
condition may sometimes have recurring dreams as elaborate
as this ;
they do not, I think, perform recurring actions so
elaborate.
There is one more point which seems worth noting about
automatic actions, viz. their tendency to spread by a sort of
mental infection among the persons who witness them. Thus,
in Dr. Gower's circle, several of the sitters must apparently
have been concerned in producing the raps, since they went
on abundantly in the presence of several different groups.
This has a certain interest in its bearing on the far more
widespread epidemic of rapping that followed the outbreak in
the Fox family in 1848. In the course of the next year or
two, it appears that the rappings had become pronounced in
hundreds of families in the Eastern States of America. We
can hardly suppose that all these people were deliberately
and consciously knocking on their own furniture. It seems
to me much more likely that the phenomenon was of the same
nature as the table-tiltings that became so prevalent a few
years later, i.e. that while in some cases it was in all pro-
bability deliberately produced, in most it was due to genuine
automatic action.
Probably few readers will be inclined to accept the hypothesis
of automatic action as a satisfactory explanation of all the
facts recorded in this paper. Though it may account for the
raps, it is obviously far more difficult—though perhaps not
quite impossible—to apply it to the levitations of the table
which I witnessed at the sitting of September 7th, 1906, and
it seems altogether inapplicable to the more decisive movements
without contact that were reported by the other witnesses to
have occurred at the earlier sittings.
We could, however, explain the levitations, as I have
Liv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 135
already suggested, by supposing an element of illusion, as
well as of automatic action : viz. that one of the three
sitters—Mrs. Williams, Dr. Gower, or myself—raised the
table automatically and unconsciously, while the other two
shared in the negative hallucination of the movement by
which it was done. This would be similar to what
constantly happens in conjuring performances, when the
particular action that does the trick escapes the notice of
the spectators ; the only difference being that in our case the
performer was an automatist, which would greatly facilitate
his task. For it is well known that actions automatically
performed are often carried out with far greater skill and
efficiency than those consciously performed, while the automatist
is not hampered by any self-consciousness in carrying them
out freely.
The hypothesis would have to be strained still further to
account for the alleged movements without contact ; for here
we should have to suppose that there was contact which
a larger number of sitters somehow overlooked on several
occasions. Having been present at the sittings, this hypothesis
does not seem to me so extravagant as it probably will to
most of my readers, for an eye-witness sees how extremely
difficult it is—under the conditions of such experiments
—
to make sure of whether any one is touching the table or
not, since the table itself inevitably obstructs one's view
of the persons on the other side of it. The tradition
of the " circle," with all the superstitions that have grown
up arouud it, is of all others calculated to baffle any exact
observation.
In conclusion, I can only say that it appears to me
impossible to form any decided judgment on the facts before
us, and unprofitable to speculate further about them till we
can obtain more decisive evidence one way or the other.

throughout Norway and much of Sweden, a reputation for supernormal
powers, which earned him the name of "Vis-Knut," Wise Knut.
Mr. Fosse has kindly supplied us with the printed documents, and
also with a translation of a portion of them. The case, though it
cannot now be brought up to any standard of evidence, is a
remarkable one, and possesses an additional interest from the fact
that it is presented by the pen of the veteran of Norse literature,
Bjornstjerne Bjornson. His account, a pamphlet of twenty-nine
pages, was published in 1898 as the "gratis" volume presented by
the Vaarsol to its subscribers, and what follows is mainly a resume
of this work. We may begin with a statement of the sources
of the evidence.
"I must explain," says Bjornson, "that I follow a book written
in the country dialect. The author is a peasant-born but educated
man named Johannes Skar, who grew up from childhood in the
midst of stories about Vis-Knut, and travelled much of the country
round to enquire personally about what was told ;
he was never
satisfied until he had spoken to those with whom Knut had come
into contact. With Knut himself he had often spoken. Knut lived
here in Svastum in Gausdal till 1877, a few [Norwegian] miles from
me, and I have myself heard many of the stories here recorded,
nv.] Vis-Knut. 137
a couple at first hand, many at second and third, and from my
childhood up I have heard others similar to those told hy Skar.
without being able to investigate the details. Johannes Skar has,
however, done this, and there cannot be the least doubt as to his
desire and ability to be veracious. Nor is there any one here who
does not say that Knut was an honest man. He lived to be 89 1
years old, he received all who came to him, the whole country-side
knew him, I might almost say by heart, and as to his honesty
there is only one opinion, alike among the old, who had known
him from a child, and those of middle age, who could not have
been affected by the strong impression produced by his first appearance
and ill-treatment. Here there is only one voice concerning him.
Differences may be heard, notably as to the significance of his
abnormal powers ; but about himself and his honesty there is
unanimity. I may perhaps add that the officials, such as priests and
magistrates, who met him in the last generation, were just as
convinced of his honesty as we are ourselves.
" I do not mean to say that he may not have been subject to
self-deception ; as to that, every one can form his own opinion. But
enough remains, partly clear of self-deception, partly mingled with
it, and yet equally wonderful, equally unexplained.
"Unexplained. Yes, there are plenty of explanations ; I have my
own in partial readiness. But I will reserve it, for I desire only
to set out a perfectly accurate record for those who desire to enter
in by material and spiritual paths where research is to this day
still behindhand."
Knut the son of Rasmus, called, in the Norwegian fashion, Nord-
garden from the name of his farm, was born in 1793. He was a
weakly and backward boy, suffering from constant epileptic fits ; the
little schooling he received left him unable to read and write when
he entered upon the hard work of a remote and poor farm, to help
his mother, now a widow. He succeeded, however, in teaching
himself reading, writing and arithmetic, and became an eager student
of the Bible. His hard life brought on a return of his epilepsy,
after a temporary remission, and he allowed himself to resort to
" witchcraft " as a remedy. The grotesque but innocent charms to
which he had recourse produced a religious revulsion, and he was
tempted to take the life which he had thus dishonoured. He
1
Bj6rnson's dates are self-contradictory. According to Skar's explicit
statement, Knut died on May 16, 1876 (not 1877), aged 83 years, 5 months
and 2 days.
138 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [part
determined, however, to seek forgiveness for his sin by partaking of
the communion. Divine service was to be held in the little church
at Svastum six weeks after Christmas, 1818. But three days before he
had to take to his bed, a prey to racking pains. When the crisis
passed, he heard harp-playing in the air and spiritual songs. Later
he seemed to hear violins and clarinets, but they clung to the
earth, while the spiritual choir had " sung up to the skies." He
remembered what they sang j
they bade him, in uncouth verse, cast
away the charm he wore round his neck, and trust to God's
medicines, Jesus' flesh and blood. It is noteworthy that all the
verses he heard, now aud later, were composed not in the peasant
dialect which he spoke all his life, but in the literary Danish, the
language of his Bible.
From the time he threw away his amulet the epilepsy left him,
and his health was for a long time good. But henceforth from time
to time he continued to hear, first indistinct music, " war music
"
as he called it, then " clear sweet tunes of all sorts," which always
at last ended in psalms—stiff uncouth admonitions in dry incorrect
literary language.
People told him that he ought to be bled —his blood was too
thick. He wanted to do as they said, but on the way " it sang
"
that he must not, and he had to return. " It went through his
ears" that it was his sin, and not thick blood, from which he
needed relief.
It was only late in the spring that he could leave his bed and sit in
the sun before his hut. He " got command " to take a psalm book and
follow with his fingers as the psalms were sung to him. When he
got strong, he got command to go to others and arouse them from
sin. This frightened him ; he was afraid they would talk about
his " thick blood." But he was told that he must hold out till he
had been to the Lord's Supper ; then all would be well with him.
Soon something fresh appeared. He could sit and " hear " what was
going on far away, even in foreign lands : and when news came, perhaps
long afterwards, it had happened as he said. A man had been lost
on the mountains—he told where. He told too where strayed
animals were to be found. On a farm where there was no good
water he told them where to dig. And all this repeatedly.
Moreover, he cured illness by laying on his hands. When he came
to the seat of disease "his hand stuck fast," and then he kneaded
with the other, shivering and writhing. He ground his teeth, and
foam came about his mouth. Then he prayed, and the patient
LIV.] Vis-Knut. 139
too had to pray aloud ;
" for if God would not help, nothing could
help."
It is easy to see what effect this must have had upon the country.
The revolution in thought had spread even to these remote valleys.
The minister of Gausdal was an apostle of enlightenment, and
had published a book for the use of the young in place of
Luther's Catechism, substituting morality for faith. Christianity had
grown cold. But when it came to the touch, the old proved
stronger than the new, and a spark sufficed to kindle a blaze of
religion. It became known that Knut was to go to church on
June 7, when service was again to be held at Svastum, and that
he had been told he would fall down on the church floor, and lie
there two hours. The whole neighbourhood assembled for the
service. Knut went into the sacristy, sat on the minister's bench,
and announced his mission. The minister thought he was mad,
and sat in patience while Knut sang psalms of admonition to him
for nearly an hour. At last service began. But Knut was seized
with convulsions because the hymns were sung out of a new-fangled
hymn-book—a book which Knut could not even touch without
violent physical disturbance. The singing stopped, and the old
favourite hymn-book had to be used. Knut was then able to kneel
for the communion, but two of his brothers had to lead him back,
and he fell motionless on the church floor. The service was
stopped. The minister wished to have him carried out, but he
begged that he might lie in " God's temple." At last he was taken
into the churchyard, and laid on the ground; the convulsions came
on so violently that he was thrown up into the air; between the
attacks he prayed and the people sang. The minister came out,
and explained to the people that Knut was in the same state as
they were when they dreamed. Knut prayed for him.
He went in the evening to a neighbouring farm, and stayed two
nights. On the Tuesday he " got command " to take the sexton,
his old schoolmaster, to the church, and have the bells rung for
him. He then went in and lay two hours on the church floor
—
the promised period, which had been cut short on the Sunday.
As he was going to the church, taking a short cut over the rough
hillside, a woman saw, as she stated in a formal deposition, that
there was a shining light over the path he took. When he came
away, he got the sexton to write down from his dictation the
hymns that had been "sung to him" as he lay, a long series of
commands for reform in the church and morals, ending with the
140 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [part
warning that if they were not carried out, "pestilence and bloody
war " would come upon the land ; and this he was ordered to send,
and did send, to the Council at Christiania.
Church discipline in Norway was at this time very severe. A
revivalist named Hans Nilsen Hauge had recently been imprisoned,
with some of his disciples, for propagating doctrines not recognised
by the Theological Faculty of Christiania. None the less Knut,
after the scene in Svastum church, devoted his life to preaching
the word, and was involved in constant trouble with the authorities,
civil and clerical. He was arrested in Frou, and the local magistrate
attempted to enforce his return home. But Knut had convulsions
and grew stiff in one leg, so that he could not be led. More men
were sent for, but he grew stiff all over, and could only be moved
step by step in great suffering. He prayed, and men and women
followed. Among them was a giant named Imort Nerlid. the
strongest man in the country, and devoted to Knut like a child.
He begged Knut for permission to set him free, but Knut refused.
At last Knut sank to the ground, and a sledge was sent for. He
was laid on it, but had a convulsion which threw him off. This
happened repeatedly ; once he was nearly thrown into a river by
which they were passing. At last the attempt was abandoned
for the moment. Worn out though he was, he held a service
the same evening, and sang to the assembled crowd a hymn
which must have made a great impression, as one man who was
there learnt it by heart from hearing it once sung, and was able to
recite it fifty years afterwards.
Meantime the military had been sent for. A captain and two
lieutenants brought seven men with loaded guns. The officers finding
the service still proceeding, went to a neighbouring house to dance
and play cards, and forgot about Knut till midnight. He was
roused from bed and tied to the sledge with a rope. He had such
a violent attack that the rope was loosened. He was tied tighter,
and another attack threw him between the horse's legs. Finally
he was secured and carried home by stages, and as each set of men
handed him over to the next he bade them farewell, praised God,
and prayed for them.
He had hardly reached home when Imort Nerlid came with a
message from the people of Fron begging him to come back and stay
with them, and promising to protect him. He was afraid, but was
" commanded " to go, and next Sunday found him in church there.
The feeling in his favour was so strong that there was almost a
LIV.] Vis-Knut. 141
popular outbreak against the minister and the man who had forced
him on to the sledge. The attitude of the congregation was such
that it was thought better to leave Knut alone.
The people of Fron were determined that he should stay with
them. The giant, Imort Nerlid, sold him half his own farm for a
nominal sum. When Imort himself subsequently left. Knut sold
his half for a good price, and invested it in an annuity. He longed
for the home of his childhood. But for many years he got but
little from his annuity, for he was summoned and condemned for
illegal medical practice (though he never took payment, and could
have done no man harm) and for illegal religious teaching. The
fine and costs which he had to pay took up the whole income of
his annuity for many years. Of course he did not give up the
healing and preaching which was commanded him. He lived at
Svastum unmarried and in the most frugal way, At first he often
travelled in the country ; later only rarely. Till he could enjoy his
annuity he lived by day labour.
He never attempted to found a sect of his own ; he always taught
that men should follow the teaching of the church—the old teaching,
of course—and attend the orthodox services. Hence he was attacked
even more bitterly by the followers of Hans Nilgen Hauge than by
the orthodox ministers. The " saints " even accused him of imposture,
which was never done by the officials. But Knut never replied ;
his nature was too mild, aud his very mildness thus gave rise to
misunderstandings. But he went his own way, always cheerful
and patient, happy with the simplest pleasures, in spite of the jeers
alike of believers and unbelievers.
His preaching was pure improvisation in homely speech. At times
he could "get nothing"; once he began with the words "The
ungodly," and could get no further; at other times he seemed
inexhaustible. The effect he produced is witnessed by the visions
which his hearers saw ; one saw him sit reading the Bible in the
evening with a rainbow from one shoulder to the other ; others
saw "two white birds on his right shoulder." No doubt his striking
appearance had something to do with this, but the main cause was
the belief of the people that he could cure them by laying on his
hands, could find things that had been lost, and tell what was
being done by persons far away.
He believed himself that all this power was God's gift, and that
God had need of him. He used to say that "the prophets had the
same as he." When he could not touch gold, silver or copper money
142 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [part
without being seized by cramp, it was God's command to shew that
money was to be refused. This is an account given in evidence
before a court of what happened in such a case :
" I put two-
copper coins in his open hand. His arm gave a jerk, he writhed
and grinned. He declared that a sinew in his arm had strained
itself. I saw on looking at his arm that a sinew beneath it was
quite hard ; a knot was visible in his hand. As soon as the coins
were taken out and Knut had rubbed his hand, the arm returned
to its natural condition."
Once he came to Stamme farm, where the farmer, Jens, was
looking for a silver shilling. " Here is something for you to find,"'
he said to Knut. "Yes," he replied, "give me another shilling to
search with." He took it and put it between two fingers. His
arm jerked it to a crack in the wall, where the lost coin was
found.
His method of water-finding was as follows. He used to go-
to what seemed to be the likeliest place, lay the back of his hand
on the ground, and move it along till his fingers jerked ; the water
would be below this spot. He had also learnt to find water by
the use of" a twig held firmly in his hand ; when water was below,
the twig turned towards his breast. The twig must be of birch,
or still better, of bird-cherry.
He cured sickness by laying on of hands, or rather handling the
sick. When he reached the seat of the illness, his hand stuck fast ;
he seized it with the other hand and rubbed, shuddering the while
and grating his teeth, while foam came from his mouth, and he
suffered greatly. But he never refused where he thought he could
help, and he never took payment. There is also abundant evidence
that he gave the sick medicine or sent them to the doctor, or said
there was nothing to be done. But it is not easy to ascertain
what were the kinds of illness which he could cure. Here is
one of many tales about him.
A little girl in Christiania was lame in both feet and had gouty
nodules on one arm. For ten or eleven years she went on crutches
;
the doctors could do nothing. She was sent to see Knut in 1839,
at the age of sixteen, accompanied by an elder sister. Knut undressed
her, handled her all over, and cried out horribly when he came to
the seat of the mischief. He went on for an hour ; then he told
her she could get up, and she stood on her feet, which she had not
done since she was five. He told her to use the crutches for a.
year, but she gave them up two days after, on the way back. The
LIV.] Vis-Knut. 143
only result of her doing so was that one foot remained weaker than
the other, but not enough to give any trouble.
This story leads up to another of Knut's faculties. The elder
sister wished to pay him, though she knew that he did not take
money. She had secretly brought with her a little coffee and sugar,
a couple of handkerchiefs, and cloth for a waistcoat—gifts which she
thought that a frugal peasant would appreciate. These she made
into a parcel, and in the middle of it —this was the greatest secret
of all —she put five dollars. The cure was so successful that she
thought her gift too small. " No, no," said Knut, without opening
it, " take back three dollars, but lend me two for travelling money
for a time." He afterwards sent a gift in repayment of the sum.
The girl's astonishment may be imagined ; but it was still greater
when she spoke to him of her mother's illness. Knut said that
nothing could be done for it. "But she has a pain in the foot,"
he added. "No," said the girl. "Yes," said Knut, "she has pain
in one of her great toes," and he picked up from the ground three
straws which were to be tied round the toe, one ever}' week. It
was 12 Norse (84 English) miles to Christiania, without telegraph or
railway. When the girls got home, and the recovered daughter
was about to spring into her mother's arms, she stopped ; the mother
was ill. One of her great toes was so bad that it had turned black,
a dark streak went right up to her knee. But the straws cured her.
(Communicated by the younger daughter).
A woman sent her maid to him one day to ask about a serious
illness. She gave the girl some wool as a present for him. The
girl thought on the way that there was too much wool, and took and
hid some for herself when she was in the forest. She found Knut
very cheerful. He said that he could do nothing for her mistress, and
she must take the present back ; but she was not to forget what
she had put under the old birch-root in the forest.
In 1874 a man disappeared from Biri, 30 or 40 English miles
from Knut. His wife, the last person who had spoken to him, took
fright (they had parted in anger) —and got sixty men to help her
to search for him, but in vain. A messenger was sent to Knut.
Knut asked no questions about the neighbourhood, which he did
not know. When told that the wife was the last who had seen
him, "Yes," said Knut, "they parted bad friends." When asked
what had become of him, Knut said that he had killed himself.
" How," asked the messenger. " He is hanging north-west of his
home," said Knut. " But they have searched there." " Yes, you
144 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [part
searched where his wife left him. But when the wife turned
away, the husband followed her, and hung himself nearer the house.
He is hanging in a great pine tree. You can see it from the farm
yard." The messenger returned ; a great pine was visible from the
yard, and in it they found the body of the unfortunate man.
Kristian Troenn emigrated from Gudbrandsdalen to America in
1869. He had an aunt there, with whom he was to stay. But no
news came of his arrival, and his mother grew anxious. She went
to see Knut, coming to him at 3 o'clock on the afternoon of
July 6. To her question whether he had arrived she received after
a long time the answer " I do not get that either." She was
distressed and asked no more that evening. Next morning she
asked Knut what had happened to her son. Knut was very happy.
" Yes, now it is certain that the boy is with his aunt, and quite
well. He has been well all the time." A letter written on July 12
confirmed this. The boy had reached his aunt's at 9 p.m. on
July 6 (3 a.m. on July 7 by Norwegian time).
Simon Hovde at Oejer had a son called Mikkel, who ran away
when 19 years old. His elder brother Klement went one Saturday
to Knut to hear where Mikkel was. He borrowed a carriole on
the way and drove a fast horse. He reached Knut's house at 3 or
4 in the afternoon. Knut had just come home from fishing in a
mountain lake ; he had felt that some one was coming on an
important errand, and that he must return at once. Klement began
his story. "I know why you have come," said Knut, "but do not
let us mind that this evening." So they went to bed ; Klement
could not sleep for anxiety. In the night Knut said "Your
brother has just come home ; I hear you are awake, so I must
tell you. —Now his father and mother are asking where he has been.
I can tell you. He went first to Lillehammer. There he met the
farmer of Kjos at Ringsaker, and took a situation with him." Knut
described the sort of work, and added that the boy did not like it
;
" what he liked least was that he had to sleep in the stable." So
Klement started home ; Knut telling him " the boy will not stay long
with you ; better let him travel, for he is restless and must have
his try." When Klement came to the place where he had borrowed
his carriole, all the people crowded round him and asked what
Knut had said ;
they had heard that Mikkel had come home in
the night, and wanted to see if Knut knew it. When Klement got
home he heard that all that Knut had told him was true. This
was in 1855 ; in 1856 Mikkel weut off to America.
LIV.] Vis-Knut. 145
In 1 828 he was at Tallaug in Gansdal. The son of the house
slept in his room one night, and relates as follows. " Knut was
restless all night, he read and prayed from time to time. I could
not sleep either ; I was afraid, and he was so ugly. At sunrise I
got up. '
I have been restless all night,' said Knut, '
and you
have not slept either ? I must tell you, a man has come for me
during the night from Saxumdal, and wants to speak to me. It is
a good thing you are up ;
you can tell him to come here directly ;
he is lying on the bench in the hall.' But Knut and I slept on
the first floor at the opposite end of the house ; neither of us could
have heard the man come to the hall. There was the stranger on
the bench ; I followed him up to Knut. He had hardly come in,
and had not got out a word, when Knut told him that he could
not help him in what he came about ; the man must go to a
doctor."
In the spring of 1835, he was well-sinking at Huseby in Hede-
mark. " It will be a busy Easter for you," he said to the housewife
on Good Friday. She thought people would stay at home for the
holiday. " No, no, there will be plenty of people coming from the
east to-morrow," he said. On the Saturday fourteen people came
from Odal to see him ;
they had heard that he was there. At this
period he always had this presentiment when people were coming
to him.
Some years ago a well was needed at Skar, the home of Knut's
biographer, where Knut had never been. At this time Knut had
ceased to go about, and those who wanted anything had to go to
him. A messenger was accordingly sent to Knut to ask where
they should dig. "What?" said Knut, "do they send here for
water when they have got water everywhere ? " " Yes, for there is
no water near the farm." " There is water enough at the farm
you come from ;
they have a well already, only dig deeper and
there is water enough." "But they want to have a pump right
in the farm." "There is a dell above the farm; do you know
where it is? There is a road there." "No, the high road does
not go through a dell." Knut :
" It is not a high road, it looks
like a cattle road." "Yes, that is right." Knut: "There is a
big birch tree in the dell ; under it there is a spot where the grass
does not bind. That is where the vein of water starts." The man
remembered this. " But they have water still nearer the farm,"
continued Knut ;
" the store-house stands southwards above the farm ;
a little house stands at the side; a vein passes under it." "That
K
146 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [part
must be the wood-shed, then," said the man. "No," said Knut,
"it looks like a store." "Then it must be the forage-house." "Yes,
it is the forage-house." Knut did not stop here. "Most of the
water," he said " comes from the north of the farm. A stream runs
through a hill-side. It comes from a swallow-hole above the hill.
You must have seen, it comes both in the corn-field and below it."
"They had a well there before," said the man; "but it did not hold
out." " Because the water passes two or three yards above where
the well was ;
very little of the water soaked into the well." The
man asked where digging would be easiest and shallowest. " Try
for yourself with a rod till you find out." " But we might make
a mistake." "Yes, yes; the vein is close to the surface just where
it comes out of the hill ; then it goes three or four rods north of
the stable ; that is the best place to dig." There they dug, and
there the well is to this day. This conversation shows how he
gradually conceived the place in imagination, at first only vaguely,
and then with more and more distinctness.
He used sometimes to make mistakes, especially in his later
years ; some men once dug for silver on his distinct and repeated
advice, but the vein was too thin and they made a heavy loss. He
used also to make mistakes in telling where a lost animal was to be
found. He used to put this down to the fact that the animal had
not stayed till they came. But it also happened that he declared
an animal to be dead when it was not dead, and vice versa. In
some cases it may have been that his directions were misunderstood,
but there is no doubt that sometimes the mistake was his. If he
was asked how this came about, he used to reply that he only
said " what he got," " what was whispered to his ear," and he used
to add, "they generally say that it is right." If he was asked, as
happened once or twice, whether the "Tempter" had not been making
him use his gift wrongly, he admitted that the Tempter might have
"fooled" him; but added that he was sure that he had never con-
sciously misused his " gift of grace " or employed it for gain. If he is
to be suspected of vanity, he must have enjoyed his satisfaction in
solitude ; for the last half of his life he passed almost as a hermit,
and if he received a visitor, he used to talk about God's wisdom,
goodness and omnipotence—seldom, and then reluctantly, about
himself.
" For my own part I fancy that if he had been less kind-hearted
he would seldom have made a mistake ; he wanted to do good
beyond his pDwers, and often yielded to insistence, but he could
LIV.] Vis-Knut. 147
not '
get it ' when he was tired or out of sorts. He used to say
when he failed that 'God was punishing him,' and that was how
he took all opposition and derision."
Here we must leave Bjornson. The cases he gives are a fair
and representative selection from the much larger collection of
Skar. But I add one not given by Bjornson, as by a curious
coincidence it has proved capable of confirmation.
"An Englishman, Captain R. Cartcath, stayed a long time in
1868 at Kvisberg in Upper Svastum, headhunting. He was
expecting a friend, C. Ferran, to go up to Dovre with him ; but
Ferran was so late in coming that Cartcath thought he must
have taken the direct road through Gudbrandsdalen.
"One day when he was out shooting, Per Kvisberg went with
him to the '
Waters-end '
in Essdalen. When they came to Erland-
husom [where Knut then lived] Cartcath told Per to ask Knut
where the bear had gone.
"
' I can't ask him about things like that,' said Per.
"'Then ask whether Ferran has gone on to Dovre,' said Cartcath.
Per went in to Knut and did so.
" 1
He has certainly not gone north,' said Knut, '
and perhaps he is
already at Kvisberg.'
" Early next morning came a message to Cartcath from Ferran
;
he had reached Kvisberg on the evening of the day when Cartcath
started for Waters-end in the morning."
On the bare chance that Captain P. "Cartcath" might be Sir
Reginald Cathcart, I wrote to him, and received the following reply :
"Thursday [27 June, 1907].
" Dear Sir,—I remember the incident you refer to. I was waiting
for Capt. Ferrand to go to Sueehatton for reindeer hunting.
"Yours very truly, R. A. E. Cathcart."
In reply to a further inquiry, Sir Reginald wrote again :
"Sat. [June 29th, 1907].
"Dear Sir, —All the people in Gausdal thought a lot of Wise
Knut. I passed his house one day and saw him. I asked where
a bear I had wounded a few days before had gone, but he did not
answer. He then told me about Ferrand. He told me if I had
a good bear dog I should probably get a bear. This I knew. My
tolb at the time had gone to Osterdalen to buy a dog, and I got
a bear soon after with Capt. Ferrand. . . .
" R. A. E. Cathcart."

The incident is not in itself of very great evidential value ; but
it is curious that first-hand confirmation should be forthcoming
after nearly 40 years, and the incident unquestionably strengthens
the opinion expressed by Bjornson with respect to the care and
accuracy with which Skar has collected and presented his evidence.

Treatment by Hypnotism and Suggestion; or, Psycho-Therapeutics. By
C. Lloyd Tuckey, M.D., Aberdeen. Fifth Edition. 10s. 6d. net.
(Bailliere, Tindall & Cox. London, 1907.)
An interesting feature of the present edition of Dr. Lloyd
Tuckey's book is an introductory chapter by Sir Francis Cruise, in
which he relates how he, like most of the medical men in these
islands who use hypnotism in their practice, was introduced to the
subject by Liebeault and Bernheim. To some of Sir F. Cruise's
remarks we shall recur later. The book itself, which is much
enlarged from the earlier edition, contains a sober and comprehen-
sive statement of the present position and achievements of hypnotism
in therapeutics. Illustrative cases are quoted, some from the
author's practice, some from those of continental physicians, of the
treatment of a long list of complaints by this method, amongst
them dyspepsia, neurasthenia, chorea, torticollis, neuralgia, writer's
cramp, chronic rheumatism, epilepsy, functional paraplegia, agora-
phobia and other obsessing ideas, and a long list of hysterical and
nervous ailments. Probably the most interesting class of cases
referred to is that of chronic alcoholism. Dr. Tuckey says that he
has treated in the last eighteen years over 300 cases, and has
effected a complete cure in about one-third of the whole number.
This proportion almost exactly coincides with the proportion of cures
effected during the year 1899 in the Dalrymple Home, Rickmans-
worth, viz., 169 out of 518 cases. As Dr. Tuckey points out, the
number of cures may seem insignificant alongside of infallible
systems, mostly of American origin, which claim over 90 per cent, of
successes. The difference lies in the fact that, in the physician's cases,
the cures are permanent. In Dr. Tuckey's practice the patients
are under observation, I gather, for at least a year, after which

date relapses appear to be very infrequent. It is to be wished
that he could have found time to bring up to date the interesting
table given on pp. 237-9, showing particulars and results of the
treatment from 1888 to 1895. Dr. Tuckey has been too fully
engaged in his practice to allow of opportunity for experiment with
a view to throwing light on the problems of hypnotism. Nor has
he apparently observed any case of thought-transference or other
supernormal faculty in his patients. He has indeed had under
treatment three or four " mediums," but he found that they all
refused to accept his suggestions, and were apparently very intractable
patients. One lady indeed insisted, when hypnotised, on taking charge
of the seance. An interesting case of double personality is given.
"I have recently (1899) met with a curious case of double
personality. The patient is a bank clerk, aged 40, with a record
of over twenty years' satisfactory service. He left the bank on
Friday after lunch, and did not return until the following Monday,
when he found he had been suspended for absence without leave.
He could give no explanation of his conduct beyond that he had
found himself late on Saturday night in a strange hotel at
Southampton. How he got there he did not know, but he found
in his pocket some postal orders issued at Guildford, so he con-
cluded he had visited that town. I hypnotised him, and he at once
became somnambulic. He replied to questions, and gradually gave
us a complete history of his doings from the time he left the bank
until he 'came to himself at Southampton. He had gone first to
call on a friend at the West End, and then on another friend in
the suburbs. He had spent Friday night in a Temperance Hotel,
and had gone to the station in the morning, and taken the first
train, which happened to be going to Guildford. There he alighted
and had breakfast. The previous day he had changed a cheque, so
he had ten pounds in gold in his purse. This he found heavy, so
he exchanged the sovereigns for postal orders. Then he felt he
should like some sea-air, and took the train to Southampton, where
he formed the plan of taking a coasting steamer to Dublin, a trip
he had formerly made with enjoyment. He strolled about Southamp-
ton, behaving much as an ordinary visitor, and engaged a room at
a hotel. At the hotel he suddenly 'came to himself,
1
and was
astonished to find himself in a strange place. He was just in time
to catch the last train to London, where he stayed the night,
and then returned to his anxious family in the country the following
morning. His friends were naturally somewhat sceptical, and it

was perhaps fortunate for him that some of them had heard of
double consciousness" (pp. 105-6).
It is interesting to note that Dr. Tuckey finds that about 80
per cent, of the patients treated by him are amenable to hypnotic
suggestion, about 15 per cent, to the extent of somnambulism
(p. 176. See also p. 178).
It will be seen that Dr. Tuckey's book, though full of interest
and instruction for his medical brethren, for all actual or possible
patients, and for all who are interested in the cure of human ills,
contains in itself little of special value for the student of our
subject. Its real value for us lies in the demonstration which it
affords that the world still moves—that even the British medical
world is capable of assimilating a new idea. For consider the
facts. The phenomena of which the present book treats have been
before the civilised world—to go back no farther than the time of
Mesmer—for considerably over a century. During the whole of
that period, with brief intermissions, they have been the subject
of systematic study in one or another continental country. In 1831
a committee of the Royal Academy of Medicine at Paris—one of
the first medical societies in Europe—reported that the phenomena
were genuine, and likely to prove useful in therapeutics. Even at
that date it was pointed out that "England, the land of the
immortal Newton," had, alone of civilised countries, refused to take
any interest in the subject. With the exception of a brief interlude
in the decade 1840-50, which produced practically no effect on the
official medical world, our proud isolation continued until some 15
or 20 years ago. Liebeault's first book was published in 1866.
Richet wrote upon the subject in 1875. Thenceforward men of
science everywhere on the continent began to study the subject and
to publish their researches. But in 1882, in the first manifesto of
the Society, we felt ourselves bound to include " hypnotism and the
forms of the so-called mesmeric trance, with its alleged insensibility
to pain," amongst the " debatable phenomena " which we proposed
to study.
In 1889 Dr. Tuckey wrote that he could find no literature in
English on the subject; and a year later Moll, in the introductory
chapter to his handbook of hypnotism, amongst a crowd of
foreigners, cites no English investigators later than Braid, with the
solitary exception of the Society for Psychical Research. In the
early years of the experiments conducted by the Society's Committee
on Mesmerism, the subject was, in fact, practically unknown. Medical

men would come to our rooms to see a boy's bod}' stiffened and
laid across two chairs, or to test the " alleged insensibility " in the
trance by driving pins into him. And even so, the demonstrations
produced little effect. In 1894 Lord Kelvin was able to write that
"one-half of hypnotism and clairvoyance is imposture and the rest
bad observation." But in the previous year a Committee of the
British Association had already reported that they had convinced
themselves of the genuineness of the hypnotic state. In the mean-
time Sir Francis Cruise, Dr. Bramwell, Dr. Tuckey and others had
been to Nancy, and had commenced to employ hypnotic methods
in their ordinary practice.
Even now the prejudice against the subject, as appears from the
present book, is not quite dispelled. Sir F. Cruise tells us in
the preface that when, in 1891, he read his first paper on
hypnotism before a Dublin Medical Society he was " earnestly and
kindly warned to abandon a dangerous subject." It is, however,
pleasant to learn that his courage in disregarding that warning has
met with its reward. Dr. Tuckey tells of a case of a young lady who
refused to try hypnotism as a means of cure, because she had been
warned against it by her medical attendant. In another case a young
man, afflicted with an irresistible craving for food, preferred to enter as
a voluntary boarder in a lunatic asylum rather than risk the
unknown dangers of hypnotism. And the case of a patient of Dr.
Tuckey's, himself a country doctor, is full of instruction. He was
so impressed by the result of the treatment in his own case "that he
took up hypnotism enthusiastically, and began to use it with his
patients. He performed two or three minor operations under
hypnotic anaesthesia ; and relieved many cases of insomnia,
neuralgia, and nervous troubles generally. But the village in which
he lived was exceptionally antiquated, and the people would have
none of the '
new witchcraft.' Dr. S. found he was looked at
askance and began to lose his practice. Being a family man, and
a sensible one, he argued that, if his patients didn't want the best
treatment he could offer them, it was not for him to force it on
them to his own ruin. So he wrote a letter to the greatest gossip
of the neighbourhood, renouncing his advocacy of hypnotism, and
undertaking never again to use it in the place. He has his reward"
(p. 209). But a " Medical Society for the Study of Hypnotism
"
has recently been founded, with Dr. Tuckey as President, and we
may soon hope to see knowledge on the subject spread more
rapidly among the profession and their patients.
Reviews. 153
There is however another aspect of the movement in England which
possesses some interest for us. I said above that Dr. Tuckey's
book affords a demonstration that English medical men are capable
of assimilating a new idea. I should perhaps have said "a new
fact," for it is noteworthy that even now few medical men in these
islands show any interest in the theoretical side of the subject-
in its bearings upon psychological, legal, or even physiological
problems. Dr. Tuckey has made no experiment and put forward
no theory of his own. After discussing current theories at length,
and showing that none has yet won predominant recognition, he
adopts the practical conclusion: "But we know at least as much
about the action of hypnotism as we do about that of many drugs
which we use every day "
(p. 279).
Sir F. Cruise is even more emphatic in his view: "I shall not
attempt to theorise or offer any explanation of [these] extraordinary
results. I have long ago arrived at that period of mental develop-
ment—for good or ill —at which I have ceased to attempt explana-
tion. If a body falls to the earth, I call it, as I have been taught,
gravitation. That word expresses a fact, but explains nothing. I
know that quinine lowers temperature and cures some neuralgias,
that aloes purge, and that opium checks the purging. Of the why
and wherefore I know nothing. So I also must acknowledge as to
the power of suggestion in hypnosis. . . . Explanation there is none,
no more than of the countless processes of physical science which
we see pass before us daily. It seems to me more profitable, with
our present means of knowledge, to observe and treasure up facts,
especially when they help us to cure or relieve disease "
(p. xv.).
I don't know whether or no Sir F. Cruise may be claimed as
an Englishman ; but at any rate the mental attitude revealed in
the above extract is commonly regarded as typically British, betraying
alike the strength and the weakness of the British character. The
existence of that attitude explains how it comes about that, apart
from some brilliant experiments by Dr. Milne Bramwell, almost the
only English names of recent years which can be added to the long
list of continental investigators are those of Edmund Gurney and
Frederic Myers. And this brings before us an interesting question.
Hypnotism for some generations occupied the place which is now
filled by telepathy, the Dreyfus case of science, in Mr. Schiller's happy
phrase. Twice have the facts of hypnotism seemed in a fair way
to become established : first in the decade which saw the appearance
of Bertrand's books and the Report of the Second French Commission
;
154 Frank Poclmore. [part
secondly, in the time of Esdaile, Elliotson and Braid. In the first
period the hopes of the new science were frustrated by the untimely
death of Bertrand, and still more by the political unrest prevailing
in France. In the second period the discovery
—
infelix opportunitate—
of chloroform and other anaesthetics robbed the new facts of their
chief practical interest, and the whole subject was shortly afterwards
discredited by its association with spiritualism. But now that
hypnotism seems at last to have come to its own, we may
profitably enquire what lesson we can draw from the long struggle,
what hope for the future establishment of telepathy.
Hypnotism owes its establishment, broadly speaking, to three
circumstances, or, to put it the other way, its general acceptance
was delayed until three conditions had been fulfilled, viz.
:
(1) It is of great practical value in medicine.
(2) Its phenomena are readily reproducible.
(3) It can be explained in physical terms, i.e., though its place in
the psycho-physiological scheme has not been exactly determined, it
offers obvious analogies to spontaneous states previously familiar,
and there can be little reasonable doubt that, broadly speaking,
its phenomena are due to some form of inhibition.
It would take too long to show in detail that these conditions
have only been fully satisfied of recent years. But (1) its general
utility in therapeutics was first established by the publication of
Liebeault's book in 1866. The earlier practitioners had devoted
too much attention, on the one hand, to the production of analgesia,
which the discovery of chloroform robbed of its chief value ;
on
the other hand, to dubious experiments in transmission of mesmeric
fluid, community of sensation, and so on.
(2) It seems probable that the production of the somnambulic state,
at any rate, has been found much easier in recent years. This
state was first definitely recognised and described by Puysegur in a
book which was not published until 1807, nearly 30 years after
Mesmer had begun to practise in Paris, and even so late as 1831
the Second French Commission reported that the state was of rare
occurrence.
(3) It will not be thought necessary to labour the third point.
It may never be possible to demonstrate any practical utility in
the study of telepathy. It may be years before systematic
experiment leads us to such mastery over the conditions that we
can reproduce the phenomena with something like the facility with
which we can now throw a subject into a somnambulic trance. And
LIV.] Revietvs. 155
it is on that very condition that real progress in arriving at an
explanation no doubt mainly depends.
And there are, it must be admitted, in the existing state of our
knowledge considerable difficulties in the way of adopting any
physical explanation yet suggested. These difficulties have been
forcibly set forth in at least two Presidential addresses. Certainly
if telepathic transmission is effected by means of ethereal vibrations,
the force diminishing, as in the case of other physical energies, in
the ratio of the square of the distance, it is difficult to conceive
how an impulse which in our experiments at close quarters seems
barely able to produce its effect when agent and percipient are
separated by a wall or a door, should even under the most
favourable circumstances, and when the disturbance is presumably of
a much more massive character, be sufficiently intense to bridge a
gulf which may amount to hundreds or thousands of miles. But it
is the part of wisdom to possess our souls in patience, and not to
assume too soon that the problem is insoluble in physical terms, and
demands, therefore, a transcendental explanation. After all, the
main premiss for such a conclusion—our own ignorance—may
any day be removed by the further progress of research : a process
which has happened again and again with kindred problems, once
held to be equally secure against explanation in physical terms. It is
not so very long ago that the phenomena of animal life were
thought to stand outside the physical world ; the very substances
of which animal tissues are composed were supposed to owe their
physical properties to a principle of vitality. But chemists can now
build up out of the bricks and mortar of the inorganic many of
these once-mysterious organic compounds. They have not yet, it is
true, built up, even in the humblest protozoon, the cathedral of
life ; but all architects must have time to learn their trade. Again,
the activities of man, especially those activities which are accom-
panied by consciousness and will, were for long thought to be
outside the physical world. But the case is so far altered that the
burden of proof is now shifted to the other side. The philosopher
who should claim to interpolate a psychical link in the chain of
physical processes which connect nerve-stimulus with action would
find it difficult to meet the challenge of the physiologist. AVe
have grounds for hoping, then, that if we are content to wait, the
difficulties in the way of a physical explanation of telepathy may
diminish, if not altogether disappear ; and meanwhile the hypothesis
is in no worse case than is, or was until recently, the hypothesis
156 Frank Podmore. [part
of gravitation. In the case of telepathy there is little difficulty, as
Sir W. Crookes has shown, in conceiving of a physical mechanism ;
the difficulty is to account for the energy not diminishing more
rapidly as the distance increases (Proc. XIV. pp. 3, 4). The force
of gravitation, on the other hand, diminishes in the ratio of the
square of the distance, but the only physical explanations of its
action yet suggested are so cumbrous, and involve such large
assumptions, as to be little more than curiosities of speculation.
But I speak as a layman. Perhaps the recent discovery that atoms
are not, after all, atomic, and that their constituent particles may,
under certain conditions, move freely through space, has rendered
the corpuscular theory of gravitation more plausible. If so, the
omen is a happy augury for telepathy. Some forthcoming results
in science may perhaps throw light upon our problem.

Hypnotism or Suggestion and Psychotherapy, by Dr. August Forel,
translated from the fifth German Edition by H. W. Armit, M.R.C.S.,
etc. Pp. 370. 7/6 net. (London and New York, Rebman, Ltd.)
This volume is a very welcome addition to the ever-growing
literature of hypnotism. Professor Forel's position in the medical
and scientific world lends great weight to his opinions, and the
fact that this is a translation of the fifth German edition proves
that they are the result of matured experience and thought.
The first chapters are devoted to the physiology and psychology
of hypnosis and allied states, and as the author asserts that the
reader who takes the trouble to study, and has the intelligence to
understand his theories will be able to grasp the subject not merely
partially and empirically, but fully and scientifically, one is put on
one's mettle. It is unfortunately by no means easy to follow all the
arguments : this difficulty arising partly from undue compression
and his taking too much preliminary knowledge for granted ; and
partly, perhaps, from occasional faulty translation. 1
Dr. Forel accepts the mneme theory of Richard Semon and adopts
his nomenclature. The mneme he explains as the sum total of the
inherited and acquired engrams, and by engrams he means the
1
For instance, page 164, we read "How does the conceited mass of voters

LIV.] Reviews. 157
permanent changes which take place in the susceptible substance of
the living organism, owing to the passage of molecular activity
waves or neurokymes. He uses the term ecphoria to express the
repeated production of the whole condition of excitation of the
organism which is synchronous with the passed complex stimulus,
and it corresponds to the psychical processes of memory and
association of ideas, and the physiological conditions of automatism,
ontogenesis and phylogenesis. Attention (maximum of our psychical
activity) he compares to a shifting functional macula lutea in the
brain conditioned by the arrival, concentration, and deflection of
the neurokymes ; and he explains the differences between conceived
and unconceived impressions which make up the conscious and
subconscious self. 1
He shows how dreams, hallucinations, and
casual hypnotic suggestions depend upon unassociated neurokymes,
and are therefore evanescent in memory and effect. Though he
says on page 6 that many processes are only conceived for an
instant, and therefore disappear for ever from consciousness, later,
page 130, he shows how in hypnotic somnambulism the most casual
thoughts and suggestions can be revived. Forel is a staunch
upholder of the Nancy school and goes as far as Bernheim in
explaining all hypnotic phenomena by suggestion. His views are
strongly anti-spiritualistic, and he even considers telepathy as
unproved, though he acknowledges the value of the evidence collected
by the S.P.R. in that direction.
Some of his analogies are very happy. For instance, to explain
the difficulty of hypnotising people of ill-regulated and disorderly
minds, he compares the struggle of a suggested idea to dominate
consciousness, to the attempt of an orator to influence a crowd.
If the people are orderly he has no difficulty in swaying them
by his eloquence, but if they are so excited and noisy that he
cannot get their attention even for a moment, the most accomplished
demagogue is powerless, and is himself swept off his feet by
the mob. But some of his assertions seem open to criticism, as,
for instance, when he says that it matters not at all ultimately
whether he hypnotises a patient so as to feel no pain from the
1
Forel thinks that vastly more peripheral stimuli travel up to the brain
than are felt, and he denies that thought or other psychical processes can exist
without sensory stimulation. Neurokymes arriving at the brain are deflected
to the centre most functionally active, and he thus explains the action of expectant
attention. If a person expects a visitor every sound is construed as the well-
known footstep. The art of the hypnotist consists in opening up of new paths
and inhibiting old ones by appropriate suggestions (page 178).

extraction of a tooth, or whether he lets him suffer the pain and
suggests afterwards that there has been no pain, thus removing its
memory !
The medical man and student will turn with the most expectation
of enlightenment to the practical part of the book, in which Dr.
Forel impartially describes his own extensive practical experience,
and here they will be richly rewarded. The author is a hard
hitter, and exposes what he considers humbug unsparingly. Professor
Dubois of Berne, who claims to cure a great many intractable
patients by his system of suggestion without hypnosis—he strongly
condemns hypnotism—especially comes under his lash, for Forel
considers all such success due to the unacknowledged use of hypnotism.
His success in obtaining profound hypnosis is remarkable, this
being due no doubt to a great extent, as with Bernheim, to his
commanding position and local prestige. We should like to see how he
would succeed with some of the patients we get in London, who " try
hypnotism" after exhausting every other form of medical treatment.
The subject's more or less unconscious counter self-suggestion is,
Forel considers, the chief cause of failure, and he has often succeeded
by finding out the opposing thought and removing it by preliminary
argument. His cases of this kind remind one of many reported
by Professor Janet and quoted in Myers' Human Personality. Forel
attempted to hypnotise twenty-three out of twenty-six nurses at
Burghoelze Asylum, and succeeded in getting somnambulism with
amnesia, obedience to post-hypnotic suggestions, anaesthesia, etc., in
nineteen of them. Dr. Oscar Vogt claims to be even more successful, and
says he practically never fails to obtain deep hypnosis in all mentally
sound men and women (page 72). Forel's nurses and attendants were
mostly of the strong stolid German Swiss peasant type, and certainhy
almost as far removed from hysteria as can be imagined. The
reviewer saw him practise upon several of them some years ago,
and the instantaneous action of suggestion was remarkable. The
Professor made much practical use of his power. For instance, be
would tell the hypnotised attendant that he would sleep alongside
a suicidal patient quite comfortably as long as it was safe, but any
unusual movement would at once arouse him. This answered
perfectly, and whereas formerly many of the attendants in that
undermanned institution used to sutler from watchful and anxious
nights, under the new regime the}' got their proper allowance of
sleep and were ready for the next day's work. Hypnotism, of course,
merely developed the faculties of inhibition and attention which
LIV.] Revieivs. 159
are latent in all of us, and which one sees exercised in a mother
who watches by a sick child. The slightest movement or cry of
the child will awaken her, whereas other and much louder sounds
will be unheard or ignored.
Forel gives full statistics of his cases and the results he obtained
by hypnotic treatment. These, from such a source, are of immense
practical importance. He sums up his experience by contending
that hypnotic suggestion should be tried in all cases of functional
nervous disturbance which resist ordinary treatment, and he assures
us that he has never seen harmful results follow when hypnotism has
been intelligently used. This harmlessness of a powerful remedy
he contrasts with the baneful effects of strong drugs, so often seen
in ordinary medical practice.
Forel relates some interesting experiences with professional
mediums. One was a woman who made a great deal of money by
fortune telling and as a diagnoser and healer of disease. She
became entranced and was controlled by " a spirit called Ernest."
Forel found the trance was genuine, and she was therefore acquitted
of fraud by the magistrates, but her diagnoses were always fallacious
and evidently based upon ocular and other sensory impressions.
Before her trial she expressed a great wish to be cured, but after
it her husband and children lamented the loss of income entailed
and got her to resume her practices. Another medium came under
his treatment at the Asylum. She was a young woman of hysterical
and erratic temperament, who had studied art in Paris, and had there
fallen into the hands of spiritualists who exploited her mediumistic
powers for money. She became ill, and went into an hospital where
Charcot's methods of hypnotism were practised with disastrous
results. Like " Sally Beauchamp " she developed a secondary person-
ality of a most objectionable type, which dominated the normal ego
and threatened to submerge it. Forel, with much difficulty and
by judicious flattery and cajolery, succeeded in suppressing this
personality and restoring the woman to more than her previous
health.
Dr. Bleuler, Forel's successor in the Chair of Psychiatry, in the
University of Zurich, relates in the appendix his experience when
hypnotised by Professors Von Speyr and Forel. These are very
similar in character to those described by Mr. "Edward Greenwood"
in the Proceedings S.P.R., vol. xvii., pp. 279 et seq.
Professor Bleuler became hypotactic, but not somnambulic. He
obeyed suggestions made during hypnosis reluctantly and clumsily,
160 Ghas. Lloyd Tuckey, 31.D. [part
but was able to resist post-hypnotic suggestions, though for some
hours afterwards he used to feel the impulse to act upon them.
Only once was a sensory hallucination realised, and that was when
Forel suggested that he should put his fingers in his mouth and
find them taste bitter.
Professor Forel laments the blindness of medical authorities who by
neglecting to instruct students as to the importance of suggestion
in the treatment of disease, allow the field to be exploited by
quacks, to the public detriment. He did what he could to correct
this neglect by conducting an admirable clinique in Zurich for the
instruction of students and graduates in medical hypnotism.
Altogether Professor Forel's book may be thoroughly recommended
to the scientific student and medical man seeking to acquire a clear
and practical view of the subject propounded by a master.

The Hygiene of Mind, by T. S. Clouston, M.D., F.E.S.E. Third
edition. Pp. 284. Price 7/6 net. (The New Library of Medicine,
Methuen & Co., London.)
This book, like the foregoing, is written by a physician eminent
as an alienist and physiologist. Dr. Clouston appeals to the
educated laity more than Professor Forel, and of course deals with
a widely different range of subjects. But, as might be expected
from physicians who have spent the greater part of their lives in
the study of insanity, one can often trace in their arguments a
common experience. On the whole there is agreement between them
in their views regarding education and the hygiene of the mind.
Forel however attaches great importance to the use of hypnotism as
a formative, reformative and educational agency in the management
of the mentally unfit and unstable ; whereas Clouston speaks rather
disparagingly of that agent and gives high praise to Dr. Dubois,
whom we have seen so severely handled hy Forel for his psychic
treatment of nervous disorders by mental hygiene and suggestion
professedly without hypnotism.
But probably Dr. Clouston's experience of medicial hypnotism is
limited, for, though he acknowledges its good effect in many cases
and correctly interprets its rationale, he goes on to say that, unfor-
tunately, hypnotic cures are notoriously haphazard and scientifically
unreliable, " Depending too much on the individuality of the particular
physician and the patient" (p. 97). Such observations indicate
LIV.] Reviews. 161
that he has only seen the Nancy method applied in a haphazard
and unscientific way, and has not studied the records of Bernheim,
Wetterstand, van Renterghem, Forel, Milne Bramwell and other
specialists. That is a pity, for Dr. Clouston is extremely liberal and
open-minded in his views, and acknowledges that "by the effect of
mental attention certain diseases of impaired nutrition from warts up
to internal tumours, from scurvy to dropsy, have unquestionably been
cured by mental influences," and again " the doctor who neglects
the mental condition of his patient in his treatment of him, no
matter what the disease may be, is not a philosophical man, and
commonly not a successful physician" (p. 96). Dr. Clouston agrees
with Forel that mind is only manifested through brain as its vehicle,
and is conditioned by the state of the brain. He does not consider
telepathy proved, and thinks that mind evolved in one brain can only
act on mind evolved in another brain through the senses. " As yet
there is no scientific proof of the mental action of one person who
is at a distance, the so-called telepathy" (p. 37). This view is rather
disappointing after the patient work of the S.P.R. for so many
years, and warns us that much remains to be done before even the
foundations of " Metapsychics " are declared truly laid by orthodox
science.
Dr. Clouston's book possesses the rare merit of being scientific
and at the same time "popular." As an example of the former,
the reader will find the very latest views on heredity as propounded
by Archdall Reid, Ford-Robertson and Beard, together with
excellent illustrations of brain cells showing their variations in
infancy, adolescence and old age, and how they are affected by over-
work and illness. From actual photographs he demonstrates how
the brain cells of the mentally deficient and imbecile are arrested
in development and maintain the infantile type. From consideration
of this and similar facts, Dr. Clouston makes an appeal for "physio-
logical charity " towards the mentally defective, but at the same
time he shows how their condition may be improved by suitable
education and surroundings. He instances the experiment made in
Glasgow, when 100 scrofulous, sickly and starved children of the slums
were drafted off to the Highlands to share the home life in farms
with surprisingly good results, from which he concludes that nature
is not so unkindly a stepmother, if we have the wit to humour
her.
The titles of the various chapters are an indication of the scope
of the book; among these we find, The Mind Machinery in the

Brain ;
Heredity, Temperament and Social Instincts ; The Hygiene
of Manners, Play, Work and Fatigue ; Mental Hygiene of Alcohol,
Tobacco and other Brain Stimulants and Sedatives. Dr. Clouston
is courageous in facing difficulties, and at the same time hopeful
and optimistic. Every chapter is full of instruction given in the
pleasantest style, and altogether the book may be confidently
recommended.

It was an ancient practice for people afflicted with bodily injuries
and diseases, or lunacy, to spend one or more nights sleeping in
the temple of a god, in the hope that through some dream or
vision, vouchsafed to themselves or the priests of the temple, they
might learn what means of cure to adopt where all human help
had failed. Stories of previous healings led them even to hope that
perhaps they might be restored to health in a moment by a miracle.
The present work is the fruit of an evidently extended and
careful investigation into the history of this custom, as practised
both in ancient and modern times. The practice was called in Latin
Incubatio, which the authoress, not very happily, renders by the
English word Incubation; it would have been better to borrow
the German designation, TempeUMaf. The book is divided into
three parts: (1) Incubation in pagan temples—those of Asklepios,
Dionysos, and others in Greece and Italy, and of Isis and Serapis in
Egypt; (2) Incubation in Christian churches in the middle ages; (3)
Incubation in modern times—in Italy, Sardinia, Austria, and Greece,
especially in Tenos and other islands of the Grecian Archipelago.
No doubt the. custom prevailed, and still prevails, in the East,
but Miss Hamilton's researches have not carried her so far afield.
The authoress shows that, wherever it is found in Christian
churches, the custom is even in minute details a direct survival of
the ancient superstition ; the Madonna or a Saint has taken the
place of a dethroned heathen god. She also gives us lively accounts
of the places where the practice still exists, and which she has
visited in her travels. But this adds little of value to our know-
ledge of the subject, and unfortunately Miss Hamilton carries us
no further. The book is hardly more than an elaborated catalogue
liv.] Reviews. 163
of the numerous places where the custom once existed or still
exists, —a catalogue often interesting, it is true, by its picturesque
descriptions and local colouring, but still a catalogue, and of undue
length. There is so little variety in the details, either of the
methods adopted by the patients, or of the real or alleged cures,
that tbe whole might well have been summarised in the space of a
magazine article. The one question that is of paramount interest
to us to-day is passed by with a mere glance, —the question, what
kind of cures are now actually effected in this way 1 That people
were and still are cured through the " Temple-sleep," we can
hardly doubt, for even superstitious human nature would hardly
continue to take part in lotteries where all draw blanks, and none
a prize. In one instance at least there was apparently an oppor-
tunity for investigation and the obtaining of a valuable piece of
first-hand evidence. In the account of her visit to Tenos, during
the great annual festival, Miss Hamilton writes :
" On the Friday
morning I saw a blind man, a Greek, who was totally unable to
see. He spent the day in acts of devotion to the Pauagia [the
Madonna], and all night he lay in the Chapel of the Well along
with the other pilgrims. As he slept, he dreamed that the Panagia
came to him, and blessed him, touching his eyes with her hand.
Then he awoke, and found that his eyesight had been restored, and
he could see as other men." It is strange that Miss Hamilton did
not realise the importance of making a thorough investigation of
this case ; she does not even tell us whether she saw the man
after his alleged cure, or how far off he was when she saw him
before it. If she could revisit some of the scenes of her interesting
journeys, and then examine, with all possible exactness, any cases of
alleged cure which came under her immediate notice, she would
perform a valuable service to psychical science. As it is, however,
she has produced an excellent guide-book for any who may be able
to undertake the task. Her work possesses the first merit of literary
style —lucidity, and is pleasingly written ; and although she has
denied us what we should have valued more, Miss Hamilton is to
be congratulated on its production.

CHAPTER I.
Introduction.
The lady whose automatic writing forms the subject of this
paper is a friend of my own, whose accpuaintance I first
made by correspondence about four years ago. Unfortunately
her family object to psychical research, and on their account
she wishes her name not to be mentioned in public. I speak
of her therefore as " Mrs. Holland." She wrote to me first
from India on July 2nd, 1903, saying that she had just
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter I. 171
finished a careful reading of Mr. Myers's Human Personality
and had been greatly interested in it on account of various
experiences of her own which were akin to some described
in the book. She had, for instance, practised automatic writing
(which she had been accustomed to call " pencil writing ") since
1893 for her own amusement and in spite of outside discourage-
ment, and was also able to see visions in a crystal. A speci-
men—ten lines of verse—was enclosed which (she said) " my
pencil wrote this morning,—I suppose because I was thinking
of '
pencil writing.'
"
I met her for the first time when she was in England about
two years later, and have had several long talks with her on
the whole subject. Sir Oliver Lodge and Mrs. Verrall also
made her acquaintance afterwards, and Mr. Piddington and Mr.
Feilding have met her once or twice, so that she is known
to some other members of the Society as well as to myself.
After a little correspondence had passed between us, Mrs.
Holland sent me the following general account of her ex-
periences :
September nth, 1903.
[Ten] years ago I first tried automatic writing, having seen a
reference to it in, I think, the Review of Reviews. My hand began
to form words almost immediately, but only short sentences of an
uninteresting kind, and the questions I asked were not answered.
The next time I tried, (these attempts were always made when I
was alone) verses were written, aud since then, though I have often
discontinued the practice for months and years, and tried to give
it up altogether, any automatic writing that comes to me is nearly
always in verse, headed
—
" Believe in what thou canst not see,
Until the vision come to thee."
The verses, though often childishly simple in wording and jingling
in rhyme, are rarely trivial in subject. Their striking feature is
the rapidity with which they come. I once wrote down fourteen
poems in little over an hour, another time ten, and seven or eight
are quite a common number to come at one time. When I write
original verse I do so slowly and carefully, with frequent erasures :
automatic verse is always as if swiftly dictated and there are never
any erasures. I am always fully conscious, but my hand moves so
rapidly that I seldom know what words it is forming.
172 Alice Johnson. [part
It would take up too much time and space to append a series of
these verses, though I have kept a good many of them. I copy one
set of verses, however, to show how easily the rhymes come in auto-
matic writing. I wrote it down as quickly as it was possible for
my hand to move, and was surprised afterwards to find that it had
a definite form of its own. It is exactly as it came to me, not
" polished " or altered in the least.
I whom he loved, am a ghost,
Wandering weary and lost.
I dare not dawn on his sight,
(Windblown weary and white)
He would shudder in hopeless fright,
He who loved me the best.
I shun the paths he will go,
Because I should frighten him so.
(Weary and lacking rest).
I whom he loved am a shade,
Making mortals afraid,
Yet all that was vile in me,
The garb of mortality,
My body that used to be,
Is mouldering out of sight.
I am but a waiting soul,
Pain-purified, seeking its goal,
Why should he dread the sight?
If I showed him my white bones
Under the churchyard stones,
Or the creatures that creep and rest
On what was once my breast,
He who loved me the best
Would have good cause for fright.
But my face is only pale,
My form like a windblown veil,
Why should he dread the sight 1
Should I beat on the window pane,
He would think it the wind and rain,
If he saw my pale face gleam
He would deem it a stray moonbeam
Or the waft of a passing dream.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter I. 173
No thought for the lonely dead,
Buried away out of sight.
And I go from him veiling my head,
Windblown weary and white. (1896)
I have been asked if automatic writing has ever stated facts
previously unknown to me, which were afterwards proved to be
correct. Automatic verses do not deal much with facts, but once
when I was staying in Italy, in an old palazzo I had never before
seen, the day after my arrival, and before I had been into the
garden, the impulse to write came on me, and I yielded to itf
without however ceasing to take part in the conversation of two
friends who were with me. One of them, who knew about my
automatic writing, asked me to read what had come to me. I did
so :
—
Under the orange tree
Who is it lies]
Baby hair that is flaxen fair,
Shines when the dew on the grass is wet,
Under the iris and violet.
'Neath the orange tree
Where the dead leaves be,
Look at the dead child's eyes! (1901)
"This is very curious," said my friend, "there is a tradition that
a child is buried in the garden here, but I know you have never
heard it."
Automatic Letters to Acquaintances.
I have said that automatic verses do not deal much with facts,
but once, when I was sensitive after illness, I experienced a new
form of automatic writing, in the shape of letters which my hand
insisted on writing to a newly-made acquaintance.
The first of these letters began with a pet name I did not know,
and was signed with the full name of some one I had never heard
of, and who I afterwards learnt had been dead some years. It
was clearly impressed upon me for whom the letter was intended,
but thinking it due to some unhealthy fancy of my own, I destroyed
it. Having done so I was punished by an agonising headache, and
the letter was repeated, till in self-defence I sent it and the succeeding
ones to their destination.
They generally came when I was trying to write ordinary letters
;
I never " sat for them " or encouraged them in any way. I never
174 Alice Johnson. [part
read them over, feeling they were not meant for me, and the
recipient, beyond telling me they referred to matters known only
to this one person who was dead, and that the writing of them,
especially the signature, bore a marked resemblance to that person's
writing, preferred not to discuss the subject. I have never seen
the writing in question.
As I regained perfect health I tried to free myself from this
influence, for it used to give me cruel headaches and was very
exhausting. I have often left my writing table and taken up
needlework or knitting till the force had spent itself. If my
hand was not actively employed at these times it would clench
itself, and make the motion of writing in the air.
Since then I have felt ou three other occasions that some unseen
but very present personality was striving to transmit a message
through me to a well-beloved. In every case the communication
was utterly unsought by me, and came as a complete surprise to
the recipient, who was always a recent acquaintance, never one of
my friends. My attention was always enforced, as it were, by a
severe pain in the head, which vanished when I had delivered the
message. But these cases would take too long to describe, and one
of them has no connection with automatic writing.
Since I have spoken of illness, perhaps I ought to say that I
have only twice been ill in the last twenty years, and I am now a
healthy cheerful woman, thirty-five years of age. I prize my health
and strength exceedingly, and it puzzles me a little that with it,
and with no desire to consider myself exceptional, I do sometimes
see, hear, feel, or otherwise become conscious of beings and influences
that are not patent to all. Is this a frame of mind to be checked,
or permitted, or encouraged ? I should like so much to know. My
own people hate what they call " uncanniness," and I am obliged
to hide from them the keen interest I cannot help feeling in
psychic matters.
I have never been in surroundings that encouraged this interest,
I have never been mesmerised, I have never attended a seance, for
the idea of anything connected with paid mediumship is peculiarly
disagreeable to me. I only discovered by accident, five years ago,
that I have the clairvoyant faculty.
In reply to my enquiries, Mrs. Holland sent me a fuller
account of her recollections of the incidents just referred to,
some at least of which seem to have been veridical. No
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter I. 175
contemporary records, however, existed, since she had sent or
given the original script—generally without even reading it
—
to the persons whom it concerned. Some of these she had
since lost sight of, while the others were mere acquaintances,
to whom she did not like to apply for corroboration of matters
involving intimate personal details. Thus there is no means
of ascertaining to what extent these early writings were veridical,
and I therefore omit the account of them, quoting only a few
sentences from it in the psychological section below, and pass
on at once to the period when the case came under my own
observation, that is, just as it began to be guided into definite
channels by Mrs. Holland's reading of Human Personality.
From an evidential point of view, the interest and value of
Mrs. Holland's script depends to a great extent, as will be seen,
on the indications of telepathy manifested—at first quite unex-
pectedly—between herself and Mrs. Verrall, and the whole report
will show how greatly Mrs. Verrall has contributed to the
result, both by her co-operation in the experiments, and by the
invaluable help she has given me in the work of investigation
and interpretation.
Mrs. Holland also has given me every possible help in the
matter. Not only has she answered fully and freely a very
large number of questions, and herself volunteered much
information, which I could not have obtained otherwise, about
the sources or possible sources of many of the statements in
her script, but she has also accepted with the utmost readi-
ness any suggestion of mine as to experiments or methods of
procedure. Further, she has consented to remain for months
at a time in ignorance of the results of these experiments,
and has continued nevertheless to persevere with them.
While never disclaiming her own strong; interest in the
o o
matter, she has always maintained an entirely impersonal
and impartial attitude in regard to it,—an attitude which
must be none the less welcome to psychical researchers
because it is fortunately not quite unprecedented in our
experience of automatists. She has, in fact, realised that it is
after all in the normal course of events that an automatist and
an investigator should act in co-operation and not in antagonism
for the advancement of knowledge.
I wish to lay stress on this disinterested attitude, because
176 Alice Johnson. [part
the somewhat minute and detailed analysis of her own
psychology which she has from time to time given me in her
letters, some parts of which are quoted in various sections
of my report, might lead the reader to suppose that she
attached an exaggerated importance to the minutiae of her
mental life. But she only began to tell me of these things
after finding that I wished to hear them, and I know that
her motive in doing so was simply to give me the fullest
possible material for forming a judgment, without any idea
of their publication.
But, with her permission, I include in my report passages
from her letters which may be of interest to others besides
myself,—partly because they give to a certain extent an
inside view of the phenomena, which are naturally better
described in her words than translated into terms of my
own. Though many of the sensations and experiences con-
nected with the script are probably subjective in origin, it
may be that certain idiosyncrasies are correlated with veridical
phenomena, in which case they would have a reflected interest
of their own. And it may be that when we know more of
the whole subject, we shall find significance in some incidents
that now seem unimportant. It seems better, therefore, for
the present to err on the side of recording too much rather
than too little.

First Period: September, 1903

General Account.
Prom the psychical point of view, her first reading of Human
Personality formed an epoch in Mrs. Holland's life, and
thenceforth her automatic writing was coloured largely by
the influence of that book. She had not known Mr. Myers
during his life-time, nor could she remember afterwards that
she had even heard his name before she read the book. But
her own experiences and her own temperament had specially
prepared her for the reception of it, and the personality of
the author strongly appealed to her.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter II. 177
Under these circumstances it was not only natural but
almost inevitable that a great part of her writing should now
purport to be inspired by him, or—to a less extent—by the
two friends to whom his book is dedicated, Mr. Gurney and
Dr. Sidgwick.
For these personations it will be convenient to use the
term " control " in the way that it is commonly used in
psychical literature—viz. in the sense of something representing
itself as a personality distinct from that of the automatist.
For evidence of the real existence of such a personality, we
have, of course, to look to the contents of the writings and
not to their dramatic form. Much of the contents in this
case deals with facts or reflections about facts within the
normal supraliminal knowledge of the automatist. There is a
considerable proportion of matter relating to facts outside her
supraliminal knowledge, some of which has been traced to sub-
liminal reminiscences, and some of which may never have been
within her normal cognisance at all. There is also a certain
proportion relating to facts which I am convinced were entirely
unknown to her at the time the writing was produced. But
a good deal of the script cannot definitely be classed under
any of these three heads, and it is further impossible to draw
the line between them. It is therefore convenient to use the
term " control " for all kinds and degrees of personation, irre-
spective of the question whether the personality is or is not
partially or completely independent of the automatist.
Before going further, I may remark that Mrs. Holland
possesses both literary ability and dramatic powers of imagina-
tion, combined apparently with a rapid perception and delicate
discrimination of character. All these cpialities are to be
found in her script ; how far they account for its features as
a whole need not be considered at this point.
The writings of this first period are chiefly of interest
from a psychological point of view, while incidentally they
reveal the attitude of the automatist towards the script. 1
will first discuss certain psychological features, illustrating
them by quotations from the script, many of which will for
convenience be repeated in their context later on.
One of the earliest passages is a curious example of the
efforts that seem so often to be made by the subliminal
ITS Alice Johnson. [part
self to keep the supraliminal in ignorance—at least for the
time being—of the sense of what is being produced. It is
written on two sides of a half-sheet of paper ; the first side
begins with the initial " F.," and the second ends with the
initial " M." ; the whole passage is divided into four short
sections, the first three ending respectively in "17/," " /l
"
and "/Ol." January 17th, 1901, was the date of Mr. Myers's
death, mentioned in Human Personality ; but the simple device
of separating these initials and items from one another was
completely effective in its apparent object. I read the passage
a good many times before I saw what they meant and I
found that the meaning had entirely escaped Mrs. Holland's
notice.
Two days later came: " 1873. 30 years ago. Cmrde
A b i w Youth." I read the first five enigmatic letters as " Com-
rade" with two vowels left out; the other four, "A big," seemed
meaningless. Long afterwards in glancing through Human
Personality (Vol. I., p. 7), I came on this sentence: "In
about 1873 . . . it became the conviction of a small group
of Cambridge friends that the deep questions thus at issue
must be fought out ..." It was then clear that the nine
mysterious letters were merely an anagram for " Cambridge."
Mrs. Holland again was quite unaware of their meaning till
I pointed it out to her.
The same writins; goes on

It lias been a long work—but the work is not nearly over yet

It has barely begun— Go on with it

1888.
The year 1888 was the date of Mr. Gurney's death, a fact also
stated in Human Personality. Here, and in other similar pas-
sages, the reference is unmistakable, and there soon begins to be
apparent a struggle between the supraliminal self of the writer
and the supposed influences. The supraliminal self is obviously
afraid of being led into attaching too much importance to
the writing. It is aware that some of the names are derived
from its reading and both resents and resists their incursion
into the script. It doubts the use of the attempts and is
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter II. 179
not very willing to persevere with them. Meanwhile the
various " controls," aided and abetted by the subliminal self
(of which they may, indeed, be fragmentary manifestations),
appear to be exerting great pressure on their side by various
arguments aDcl artifices to encourage the writer and persuade
her to go on, e.g.
:
(September 19th, 1903.) You should not be discouraged if what is
written appears to you futile— Most of it is not meant for you
—
You are the reporter— the recorder —and need not be the critic . . . .
Dun't be in too great a hurry.
(September 21st, 1903.) Do not feel that criticism need act in the
least as a fetter—don't let it hinder you at all .... Nothing
is unimportant, however much it seems so
—
There is no effort unavailing
—
You fail—yet save another's failing.
(November 25th, 1903.) Do try to forget your abiding fear of being
made a fool or a dupe. If we ever prompt you to fantastic follies
you may leave us. But we only wish you to give us a few passive
patient minutes each day. It's a form of restless vanity to fear
that your hand is imposing upon yourself, as it were.
The " Gurney control," who expresses himself rather strongly
and brusquely, writes
:
(November 14th, 1903.) I can't help feeling vexed or rather angry
at the halhhearted way in which you go in for this —you should
either take it or leave it. If you don't care enough to try every
day for a short time, better drop it altogether. It's like making
appointments and not keeping them. You endanger you own powers
of sensitiveness and annoy us bitterly—G.
The " Myers control," on the other hand, makes his appeal
to the sympathies of the automatist
:
(January 12th, 1901.) If it were possible for the soul to die back
into earth life again I should die from sheer yearning to reach you
—
to tell you that all that we imagined is not half wonderful enough
for the truth .... If I could only reach you—if I could only
tell you—I long for power and all that comes to me is an infinite
yearning—an infinite pain. Does any of this reach you —reach
any one—or am I only wailing as the wind wails—wordless and
unheeded.
180 Alice Johnson. [part
In these utterances, taken by themselves, there is clearly
nothing to suggest more than a dramatisation by her subliminal
self of personalities that had attracted Mrs. Holland's interest
through the normal means of reading a book. The question
whether anything more than this is really represented in
them will be considered later on. Meanwhile I am bound
to emphasise the large part played by Mrs. Holland's
normal knowledge in the construction of the various roles.
They came into existence first shortly after she had read
Human Personality, and it will be seen that passages from
this book are clearly to be traced in the script ; there is
little or nothing in the characterisations that could not be
derived from it directly or by inference by an intelligent
and sympathetic reader. There are, moreover, a certain
number of features that an intimate friend of Mr. Myers's
would see to be uncharacteristic or positively incorrect.
Further, the personalities become suddenly more vivid and
realistic at a later date, after Mrs. Holland had seen the
portraits of Mr. Myers, Mr. Gurney and Dr. Sidgwick in
Mr. Myers's posthumous work, Fragments of Prose and Poetry,
and glanced at parts of the book itself, as described below,
p. 245 ; and again after she had seen reviews of the Memoir
of Dr. Sidgwick early in 1906.
As usual in automatic writing, there are various different
indications of which " control " is purporting to be present.
Occasionally, but not very often, the " control " uses a
signature—either in full, or in initials. Often the contents
of the writing leave no doubt as to who it is. And, as
usual, varieties of hand-writing are associated with the different
controls, though they are not always used consistently for
the same one.
Mrs. Holland's own hand-writing is of a rather strongly
marked type—clear, bold, round and legible. One marked
characteristic in it is that the words are very disjointed,
the pen being lifted generally several times in the middle
of every word, sometimes after every letter. The automatic
writing, on the other hand, is more sloping and more pointed
and far more continuous than the normal, the words often
running together without any break between them. This
is the usual writing of the " Myers control," but it is not
LV.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter II. 181
confined to him, being apparently the normal type, if one
may call it so, of Mrs. Holland's automatic writing—the
form which it seems to tend naturally to take unless some
special idea suggests a variation.
The " Gurney control " uses a more bold and upright style,
which is sometimes almost as disjointed as her ordinary
writing. Of this style Mrs. Holland wrote later (November
16th, 1905): "When the writing changes from very sloping to
upright, I always get the impression of a younger and more
brusque personality. The initial '
G.' often comes then."
At the beginning of this period, pencil or ink is used
indiscriminately. On November 18th, 1903, the "Myers
control " begins in pencil, then writes :
" Take a pen," and
the writing goes on in ink, " That's well—a pen is best when
I am here—pencil for the upright vehement writing," viz.,
that of the " Gurney control " ; and henceforth these two
controls generally—but not invariably—use a pen or pencil
respectively.
There is no resemblance between their writings and the actual
hand-writings of Mr. Myers and Mr, Gurney, nor—so far as
I am aware—is there any reason for associating ink specially
with one and pencil with the other. It appears to be simply
a sort of subliminal device for keeping the two personalities
distinct ; nevertheless they often tend to merge into one
another,—the suggestion being either that two influences
—
real or imaginary—are present at once, or that one is being
gradually displaced by the other.
A similar subliminal device is manifested on Jan. 6th, 1904
—thus described by the script :
" Two influences—that was
why the pencil slipped from your fingers and flew across the
room then .... Don't you notice a new feature to-day—that
every few minutes we make you take another pencil. It's
easier for us, and it marks the change for you." Mrs. Holland
notes of the script produced on this occasion :
" This writing-
took a full half-hour, and my hand was very restless all
through, and held the pencils (four lay by me and my hand
kept on changing) in two very peculiar ways for two of the
entries. At the end my hand felt shaken and pushed as it
did when I first began to get these writings, scrawling wildly
till it was stopped. The [word at the end of the script]
M
182 Alice Johnson. [part
'stop' was from without entirely. I was willing to let it
scrawl on and over to the next page if the impulse continued."
On May 23rd, 1907, Mrs. Holland writes of this occasion:
" I still recall clearly the curious sensation that accompanied
the word '
stop.' My hand seemed to be taken, the wrist
turned towards the left and then drawn off the paper. It
is the only time I have ever felt '
uncanny '
in connection
with script."
Occasionally—but very rarely—the script is guided or accom-
panied by conscious impressions relating to it. Thus on Nov.
7th, 1903, (quoted in full below) it says: "I think it might
be better if the agent wrote the thoughts in her brain instead
of keeping a vacant brain and a passive hand." It continues
as if she were speaking in her own person, and in a hand-
writing intermediate between her ordinary and her automatic
style :
" Very well, I will write down what I am thinking of
but my hand feels as if it wanted to scrawl and the words
have a tendency to run into one another. I find myself
picturing a tall man, etc." Of this writing she notes :
" My
brain was far more influenced than my hand and that is very
unusual." Probably she means by this that she was more
conscious of the sensory than of the motor element in the
automatism.
The same conception is developed further on a later and
especially interesting occasion, January 12th, 1904, the script
of which is given in full below, see p. 232.
The more purely subjective side of these dramatisations is
represented sometimes by partial dissociations of consciousness,
sometimes by definite sensations or disturbances.
Mrs. Holland says in her preliminary account—already quoted
—that she used to have with the impulse to write or speak a
severe headache which vanished with the fulfilment and cessation
of the impulse. In two of the cases described in the fuller account
which I omit, she seems to have partially lost consciousness.
Thus, in the first: " I shut my eyes. It seemed to me that
the pencil scribbled wildly, like a child pretending to write .
.'
.
My right arm seemed the only part of my body that was
not asleep, and I was only conscious of Mr. 1). saying now and
again, '
Wait a minute,' when he slipped fresh paper under
my hand. Then the influence suddenly passed ; I opened my
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter II. 183
eyes feeling refreshed and alert, my headache was absolutely
gone." Again, in the second case, when the impulse took the
form of speech :
" Though I spoke English, I felt as if reading
aloud from a language I could pronounce but not translate. It
seemed to come from my lips only. I was perfectly conscious
;
I watched the effect of mingled moonlight and electric light
on the deck before me . . . My voice went on, but I did
not grasp the sense of a single sentence." In continuation of
the same incident, next evening :
" I began to describe an
elderly man, his character, manner and appearance, down to
minute details, and this time I understood what I was saying,
but the words came without being chosen."
Of the script in general, Mrs. Holland says :
" I am always
fully conscious, but my hand moves so rapidly that I seldom
know what words it is forming."
The headaches of this early period have recurred only to
a slight degree and very rarely since. On the other hand,
Mrs. Holland reports later an occasional tendency to drowsi-
ness in connection with the writing which, if encouraged, might
probably develop into trance.
Other slight pains mentioned may be due to ordinary
muscular exhaustion, occasioned by automatic contractures of
the muscles. Thus, of the script of Nov. 11th, 1903, three
large MS. pp., Mrs. Holland notes: "This took 2 0 minutes,
and left my whole arm feeling very tired." Next clay two
pages only were written, and she notes: "This took 10 minutes
and was not in the least fatiguing." On Nov. 17th, after
some mirror-writing, written with the left hand, the script
remarks :
" Your hand gets tired soon because it is not passive
enough. Make it limp. At present the whole arm has to be
moved from the elbow. It is only your wrist and fingers that
need move really."
On Nov. 27th the Gurney control writes: "The pain in
your shoulder is new to you, isn't it ? But it's slight and I
think it means that F.'s power is deepening. Let your hand
be more flexible and the shoulder will not suffer."
On Jan. 5th, 1904, Mrs. Holland not having found leisure
for the script since Dec. 5 th, the Gurney control writes
:
" Why did you stop ? Your hand needs to be pushed and
dragged now. All the scrawling and thumping again I hoped
184 Alice Johnson. [part
you had done with for good—[then in another writing]—Yes,
I know your arm is aching—want of practice only."
On Jan. 7th, 1904, after a page of writing, the script
says :
" The reason you feel sleepy is that too many are
trying to come at once, and that is why the writing is so
vague and scrawling again. Pull yourself together and think
of one particular one—Pen." Here Mrs. Holland notes :
" At
this point I had such a strong feeling of mal dc mer that I
had to go to my room for a few minutes. It left as suddenly
as it came and I do not understand it, for I never experienced
it on dry land before." More script was produced on the
evening of the same day, in the course of which the Myers
control remarks :
" Your feeling of faintness and sickness this
morning before I wrote my message, the longest that I have
yet been able to send, was an instance of jarring influences
bearing a hostile effect on your house of clay."
Mrs. Holland's feeling of special fatigue after the writing
of Jan. 12th, 1904, has already been mentioned. In a letter
to me written the same day, she says :
" To be interrupted
when writing automatically gives me a jarred feeling and at
times a feeling of dizziness which is very unpleasant."
It is natural enough that the subliminal self should try to
find an explanation for these different sensations and different
behaviours of the hand by associating them with different
external influences, or different degrees of the influence, though
there is no evidence for any such causal connection. Neither,
of course, must it be supposed that the scriptural attempts at
explanation, or the crude and often contradictory theories
expressed as to the nature and conditions of communication,
necessarily represent the views of Mrs. Holland herself; for
the views expressed in automatic writing frequently differ from
those of the automatist, who must no more be held responsible
for them than for opinions expressed by characters in his
dreams.
Extracts from Script.
I will now give extracts from the script of this period,
taking them not in their strict chronological order, but in the
order in which I received them from Mrs. Holland, and
including many of the passages already quoted without their
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter II. 185
context above. The first was sent to me in a letter dated
November 19th, 1903, which ran as follows:
... I am glad to know that you agree with me as to the harni-
lessness of automatic writing for a person of average common-sense.
Its snare for me lies in the direction of boredom rather than of
blind faith. However, in September, I experimented for one week,
by spending a short time every morning in waiting for automatic
writing at 11 a.m. That is a good commonplace hour, when one is
not likely to be over-imaginative. I found the results disappointing,
though, when I looked over them the other day, there seemed to
be rather more continuity of thought than I had at first realized.
I have not destroyed them yet, and if you care to see them I will
send them to you.
Since then I have tried fitfully several times, and find verses on
the decline, and in their place come initials, names, and dates, which
are irritating because it is impossible for me to trace them. For
instance, how can I find out if in the " Old Parish Church " at
Nantwich there is a plain grey stone slab recording the birth and
death of John Collins, an old man who died in 1873 ? I had to
look up Nantwich in an atlas before I knew what county it was in
!
Then, again, I have never been in Cambridge, but in the two pages
of automatic writing I enclose, what purports to be an address there
is thrice given, and the third time it is stated to be Mrs. Verrall's.
I remember that lady's name in connection with experiments with
crystal vision in Human Personality, but I have no means of learning
if " Selwyn Gardens " is a real place.
Will you forgive me for troubling you with the writing 1 I do not
like to suppress it, as it gave me the impression of some one very
anxious to establish communication, but with not much power to do
it, and no special brief message to convey as yet. My brain was
far more influenced than my hand, and that is very unusual. On
the second page * shows from where my hand began to move
automatically again. I feel sure I should recognise a portrait of
the man who wants to be identified if I saw one now, but I cannot
be sure if I have seen one already. I certainly never saw him
actually, but I vaguely remember a portrait seen in some paper
two or three years ago, but I cannot^remember the name below it.
By seeing, I do not mean that the figure appeared as an actual
phantasm standing in the room ; I saw it " at the back of the
brain," in the way that clairvoyant sights come to me.
186 Alice Johnson. [part
" Lucy " and " Agnes Lysaght " mean nothing to me, the last
name has been written several times lately.
The script enclosed in this letter was written (as Mrs.
Holland notes on it) on Nov. 7th [1903], at 11 a.m. It begins
with a scrawl ending in the initial " F." The sentences in
round brackets are in Mrs. Holland's normal hand-writing,
being apparently questions addressed by her to the " control."
The punctuation is generally represented by dashes and
capital letters. The illegible scrawls after the word " Eidolon
"
have some superficial resemblance to Greek characters.

I am not aware of Mr. Myers having made any compact. The reference
is probably to the "compacts" to appear, if possible, at or after death, men-
tioned in various cases given in Human Personality, Chapter VII. (Vol. II.
pp. 42 et seq.). It would be natural to guess that Mr. Myers might have
made such a '

Mr. Myers and used in Human Personality.
188 Alice Johnson. [part
I happened to see Mrs. Verrall the day after I received
this script, and I then told her that a lady in India had
sent me some automatic writing containing her name and
address ; but that the lady had been reading Human Person-
ality, and the main points in her writing seemed to be derived
from it. I did not show Mrs. Verrall this writing or tell
her anything more about it until Oct. 1905. On November
16th, 1905, I read to her the description of the man, as it
had occurred to me that it was not unlike Dr. Verrall, and
she agreed that there were many points of similarity. In
1903 Dr. Verrall was 52, but looked older on account of his
delicate health. He had a beard as well as moustache—more
grey than his hair ; when run down, he tended to have a
nervous cough. His hands were well-shaped with long fingers
which have become crippled and much bent from rheumatism.
He has never worn a seal ring. The other points mentioned
are correct.
As to the remark in Mrs. Holland's letter, quoted above
(p. 185), that she vaguely remembered a portrait seen in some
paper two or three years earlier, which she thought might
possibly be the source of her description, Mrs. Verrall tells
me that no portrait of Dr. Verrall, as far as she knows, has
ever appeared in an illustrated paper. There are two portraits
of him in his house, but neither has been reproduced. A
photograph of him was taken about 1906, the one previous
to that having been when he was under forty.
On re-reading the description later, Mrs. Verrall writes
:
The attitude strikes me as particularly good. The trick of lean-
ing forward and gesticulating when interested in what he talks of
is very characteristic. The use of the initials A. W. without the
final V. is also characteristic in the case of Cambridge friends and
especially of Mr. Myers.
Also the phrase "Is A. W. satisfied?" is curiously parallel to the
phrase in my script, October 6th, 1901: "But A. W. V. must be
satisfied."
This latter phrase was used in connection with an ex-
periment described in Mrs. Verrall's Report on her script
{Proceedings S.P.E., Vol. XX. pp. 156-167 and 387-394), in
which Dr. Verrall tried to convey three Greek words to her
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter II. 899
telepathically. The report was not published until October,
1906, but a brief abstract of this experiment appeared in the
Journal S.P.E., May, 1903, including the phrase "A. W. V.
[i.e. Dr. Verrall] ought to be satisfied." I have every reason
to believe (see below) that Mrs. Holland had not seen this
or any other number of the Journal.
The description of the man in the script just quoted,
though certainly like Dr. Verrall, appears to be meant to
refer to a dead person (" he seems to be summoning up the
appearance of what he used to be "), and some passages in
the later script make it clear that Mrs. Holland herself identified
the man described as Mr. Myers. The description is quite
incorrect if applied to him.
With regard to the mention of Mrs. Verrall's address in
this script, in Human Personality she is spoken of as " Mrs.
A. W. Verrall, a lecturer at Newnham College," and her
address is not given. I thought it not unlikely, however,
that Mrs. Holland might have seen Dr. Verrall's address in
Who's Who or some such work of reference, and have kept a
subliminal recollection of it. I wrote to her explaining that
there was strong evidence that facts that had been once
known and absolutely forgotten might remain in the subliminal
memory and emerge automatically, and that much in her
writing was clearly derived from reminiscences of Mr. Myers's
book, though some of it could not apparently be so explained.
I asked her to tell me whether she had seen any of the
S.P.R Proceedings or Journals, or what other books she had
read on the subject. I said that in order to avoid giving
hints which might be developed by her subliminal conscious-
ness, I preferred not to tell her at present which parts of her
script appeared possibly evidential, but I asked her to continue
sending to me all the script she got.
This letter perhaps formed a point ele repere for the vision
seen by Mrs. Holland on the night after she received it, as
described in the following letter dated January 12th, 1904:
I am delighted to answer any questions that may help me to
utiderstand how much of the automatic writing I get is due to
subconscious memory, and how much, if any, comes from other
influences. I am so afraid of becoming a self-deceiver, charlatan
malcjri moi !
190 Alice Johnson. [part
I have never seen an}' of the Proceedings or Journals of the S.P.R.,
and Mr. Myers' Human Personality is the only book on the subject
I have ever read. I remember looking at Mr. Lang's Dreams and
Ghosts when it first came out, but 1 have not seen it since, and my
memory of it is limited to the story of a dog's ghost. Years ago
I read two or three collections of ghost stories, of the Glimpses in
the Twilight type, and I re-read that particular collection the other
day. In 1902 a friend sent me a MS. book of copied "spirit
writings" to read: flowery descriptions of the "Happy Land,"
signed with names like pantomime fairies, which I disliked intensely.
I have never seen any other examples of automatic writing.
... I am glad that you wish to see more automatic writing.
If I may send 3^011 all I get it will remove the scruples I have
felt about writing down " messages " I could not attempt to verify.
Please continue not to give me any clue as to the meaning or
meaninglessness of anything that I may send you ; I am very anxious
not to begin to think of "hits and misses," and indeed I feel as
if the less I thought of it, the less misleading it is likely to be.
I will send you by this mail the September experiment of writing
every day for a week, to which I referred before, and also an
exercise book in which I have written during November and quite
lately. I had to give up writing for a month, because December
is such a busy time here that I could not count on even half-an-
hour undisturbed in the morning, and to be interrupted when
writing automatically gives me a jarred feeling, and at times a
feeling of dizziness which is very unpleasant. . . .
The names I know to be real, which occur here and there, always
distress me, but if I suppressed what had been written when it did
not suit my own taste, I should feel very dishonest.
Since apparently trivial impressions have sometimes a meaning,
I think I must tell you that on the night of January 4th I had
one of my vivid infrequent dreams, or rather "visions of the night,"
for they always seem to precede sleep. I was tired and neuralgic
after a week of late hours, and when I went to bed I darkened
the room completely, instead of leaving a small lamp burning as
usual. Very soon, an unexpected light made me think that one of
the electric lamps in the next room had been turned on, until I
saw the light was too diffused to be coming through the chinks of
the door. As I watched it, it altered its character, becoming a
large luminous patch with jagged edges, on a black background
which it did not illuminate. This was a new experience for me,
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter II. 191
and I was very interested and confidently hoped to see a scene, or
at least a face, appear in the centre of the light. Instead of this
I suddenly seemed to be standing behind a man who was sitting
at a large kneehole writing table. A long window was in front,
but I did not see anything through it. I wanted to see his face
and moved round to the right, but his head was so bent that I
only saw a fine brow, grey hair, the points of his rather old-fashioned
turned-down collar, and a loosely tied dark tie. He was busy with
proofs and MS., and as I watched him he sighed heavily. Then I
noticed that the pen he wrote with left no mark on the paper,
and it struck me that he was a shadow in real surroundings. At
the instant I came to myself again, in my dark room, and did not
sleep for more than half an-hour after. Unless this impression has
some connection, symbolical or otherwise, with your letter which I
received that day, I am at a loss to account for it. You will
understand I do not ask if there is any connection ; I only wish to
mention it to you.
There seems little doubt that this vision represented Mrs.
Holland's subliminal conception of Mr. Myers, but, though not
unlike him as far as it goes, it is too vague for identification.
I now give in chronological order some extracts from the
above-mentioned batch of writings sent to me on January
15th, 1904, which are chiefly interesting as illustrating the
characteristics of the Myers and Gurney " controls " and their
gradual development during this period.
There is little or nothing worth noting about the meagre
and fragmentary utterances of the other controls, a few of
which are included in these extracts. They are sometimes
indicated more or less dubiously by variations in the hand-
writings, to which no names are attached. In other cases
occur the names, John Collins, Agnes Lysaght, William Nixon,
which I have not traced and suspect to be fictitious. Another
group consists of: a dead child, whose mother was a casual
acquaintance of Mrs. Holland's ; the lady called below " Mrs.
N." (see p. 287); and Lady Mount-Temple; all these being
persons of whom Mrs. Holland had heard, like the Laurence
Oliphant control, which appeared for a short time in 1905
(see p. 259).

Note.
The words enclosed in round brackets in the following
extracts are notes made on the script at the time by Mrs.
Holland, giving the day and hour of the writing, the questions
she occasionally put to the controls, her own feelings or
circumstances at the moment, etc.
The initials or words in square brackets at the beginning
of passages have been added by myself to show which control
purports to be operative (as judged by the hand-writing or
contents), or the points where there is a definite change in
the hand-writing indicating some change of control. The
Myers control is represented by the initial "M." and the
Gurney control by the initial " G." The indications, however,
are often dubious and in many cases have probably no real
significance.
The following passage, dated September 16th, 1903, is
written on two sides of a half sheet of paper, the first side
ending with the number 17, and the second with the initial
"M." The date 17/1/01 was that of Mr. Myers's death,
stated in Human Personality (Editorial Note). As mentioned
above, the separation of the initials and numbers from one
another prevented me for a long time from seeing their
significance.

The next passage, written on the same day, begins with the
date 1888 (the date of Mr. Gurney's death, also stated in
Human Personality), and the initials F., E., and H. S.—obviously
intended to represent Mr. Myers, Mr. Gurney and Professor
Sidgwick.

As mentioned above, I traced the latter part of this passage
after some time to a sentence in Human Personality (Vol. I.,
194 Alice Johnson. [part
p. 7), which showed me that the enigmatic letters were an
anagram for " Cambridge."
Next day came some advice to the automatist, part of which
I quote.
(September 1 9 tb , 11 a.m.)
[M.] You should not be discouraged if what is written appears to
you futile— Most of it is not meant for you— You are the
reporter—the recorder and need not be the critic
Perhaps the people for whom messages—or attempts at messages
are sent will never see them—but it is important that you should
be en rapport—think no time wasted even though it brings you
nothing more interesting than this Don't be in too great a hurry
—
A few minutes later on the same day, while Mrs. Holland
was reading, some scribbled initials, and then words, came as
follows :
—
F. W. H. M. F. Edmund. H. S. Fifteen years does it seem
so long to you ?
1886

Fred
A compact that could not be fulfilled in January can yet be
carried out.
In Human Personality, Vol. I., p. 8, occurs this sentence
:
" The fifteen years that have elapsed since the publication of
this book [Phantasms of the Living] in 1886 ... " A foot-
note on the same page states that Professor Sidgwick was
the first President of the S.P.P., and Mr. Grurney its first
Honorary Secretary, he and Mr. Myers being joint Honorary
Secretaries of the Literary Committee of the Society. The
name " Mary " is, I think, meaningless in this connection.

There are a few good prints in the room—but it is not easy to
see them
—
Shelves on one side have a few books and a great many papers
and pamphlets on them— The room is not in the least interesting
in itself but very interesting things have happened there and some
men now dead still influence that room very strongly
—
When I read the above description it did not suggest to
me any room that I knew. About Christmas, 1905, I gave
Mrs. Verrall a large quantity of the early script to read,
and she pointed out to me that the description applied
closely to her dining-room. She wrote on January 1st, 1906 :
" From '
A room '
to '
very dark '
seems quite correct, though
there is a fourth window not noticeable from door. Bust 1
on pedestal quite wrong. Rest of description correct. On
bookshelves are kept still some unbound magazines, etc., and
there used to be more papers and pamphlets. Quite recently,
summer of 1905 about, the addition of a large edition of
Thackeray and the filling of three more shelves with books
made it necessary to turn out the papers." There is a
portrait (of Dr. Verrall) corresponding to the description, but
beside the fire-place, not over it. It was appropriate to say
that interesting things had happened in the room and that
some men now dead still influence it, since it was naturally
in that room that Mrs. Verrall's friends who were interested
in psychical research had often been entertained, as well as
many other Cambridge men, some of whom are no longer
living.
The next passage is one of a small number where definite
statements with names are given which are probably quite
imaginary. I have made enquiries at Nantwich and no trace
can be found of John Collins or his tombstone.
1
It is a curious coincidence that a friend of Mrs. Verrall's, on being told
of this description, remarked, "But there is a bust in your dining-room."
Mrs. Verrall took him into the room and found that what he had vaguely
supposed to be a bust was really a large filter which stood in a rather dark
corner of the room.

The passage ends with two or three unfinished attempts
at the signature F. W. H. Myers with the sign and
again the date 1873.
Apparently no more script was produced until Nov. 7 th,
1903, when the passage already quoted (see p. 186) was
written. The next day Mrs. Holland began to write, at first
daily, afterwards with occasional breaks, in the manuscript book
sent to me on January loth, 1904. I have not succeeded
in identifying the room described as below on Nov. 8th.
(November 8th, 1903, 12.30 p.m.)
[M.] My first wish is that you should try patiently and steadily
—with no undue hurry for results. Patience is the chief thing
asked of you. You must not expect more than [sic] first than

flourishes. Ask questions if you wish to but the passive mind
will be the best attitude. Try not to wish too much for any
particular topic—or you are more likely to deceive yourself by
supplying phrases from the subliminal self—dull it as much as pos-
sible, and let the outer impulses exercise a telergic influence on
you— Telepathy is perhaps the better word in this case

piece—there is a very big knee hole writing table—it is tidy now
but it was always covered with papers while its master lived— A
big leather covered chair with a bookrest attached is on the left of
the fireplace
—
The next script is dated November 9th, 1903, 10.45 A.M.,
and consists of a detailed description of a death, purporting to
be given by the deceased person. No name is mentioned, but
the handwriting is that of the Myers control, and a phrase
contained in it : "I had many reasons for desiring to live
—
the book for one "
—is appropriate to Mr. Myers, since he left
his book, Human Personality, unfinished when he died. Mrs.
Holland apparently took it at the time to refer to Mr. Myers,
though, as will be seen, the script itself later repudiated
this interpretation. Next clay she saw in an Indian paper,
dated November 10th, 1903, the announcement of the death
of Lord Kowton. Afterwards she sent me this paper, contain-
ing the following notice :
" Obituary. London, Nov. 9. The
death is announced of Lord Rowton," and told me that she
had met him in England some years before and had heard
of his severe illness in 1902, but did not know he had
been ill again. She ascertained later that the hour of his
N
198 Alice Johnson. [part
death was 4.45 a.m. which is about equivalent to 10.45 a.m.
(the hour of her script) in India. After hearing of his death,
she attempted to get from her script answers to various
questions about his illness, etc., and looked up the facts in the
English papers when they reached India. She found that
the statements in the script were partly correct and partly
incorrect ; but in so far as they were correct, they do not
seem to go beyond what she might have guessed from her
knowledge of Lord Eowton. There remains the coincidence
that the description of a death is written at the time of his
death. There is, however, nothing to suggest that the death
referred to has only just occurred ; the description would apply
equally well to a long-past experience. Nevertheless the phrase
" I had many reasons for desiring to live—the book for one
"
was appropriate to Lord Eowtou as well as to Mr. Myers,
since he had had the materials for a life of Lord Beaconsfield
left in his hands by the latter with the injunction not to
publish anything for twenty years ; the time had now come
and he had been planning the book. (All this was known to
Mrs. Holland at the time.)
On November 11th, the script having stated that "an intel-
ligence absolutely unknown to you is at present in charge,"
Mrs. Holland asked :
(Did you give me the writing that came on the 9th])
[M.] No—but you must wait to know who did — Do try to
make your mind more passively receptive — Don't think of things
you want to know or understand—otherwise you will presently
transcribe your own imaginings—delude yourself and be no help
to others— Keep a peaceful passive mind and try merely
to write down legibly what your hand wishes to write— At
present now your hand often wants to write down something while
your mind is full of quite another set of thoughts and the result
is confusion
If you wish to experiment in your own mind—try at another
hour of the day—with another pencil and in another book—to write
down the thoughts and questions that present themselves— That
will be a Mind Book—but keep this for a Hand Book. In this
devote yourself to the mere mechanical task of keeping the writing
legible— Let the hand alone be responsible for what is writing.
Detach your own brain from the writing as much as possible— If

the pencil wants to move in your fingers let it but don't allow
scribbling and scrawling.
[G.] Belief is perhaps a help to this but obedient passive help
is really the best thing— Bother your preconceived ideas —let them
rest and give up your hand for a few minutes daily to be moved
as it likes

(This took 20 minutes and left my whole arm feeling very tired.)
(November 12th, 11.20 a.m.)
[M.] Morning is the best time to try for writing while the brain
is fresh and new as it were— Very early would be the best time
of all— No matter if you are sleepy
—
Yes, I know that when you tried in the dusk it was almost
impossible to read but that was not because the writing was illegible
but because you wrote one line on the top of the other. 2

careful feeling would prevent your doing that and night and silence
are good times too and perhaps the fact that you are tired then
would make you easier to influence

Mrs. Holland tells me that this refers to some script produced before she
had begun sending it all regularly to me.
200 Alice Johnson. [part
The last passage is another instance of the emergence of
a subliminal recollection. Mrs. Holland notes (November 15th
1905): "This, as Miss Johnson pointed out to me, must
mean a reference to Lord Bute's heart being taken to the
Holy Land. The. sentence that followed should have given
me the clue, for years before I had been much interested in
Lord Bute's excavations in the old Priory grounds at St.
Andrews." The last sentence of the script, then, no doubt
refers to these excavations, and further references to Lord
Bute's heart occur later (see below). There is, so far as I
know, no appropriateness in the association of Denbigh and
Banff with Bute.
(November 14th, 11 a.m.)
(Now I do not expect to get any writing to-day for I am busy and
hurried and not well— but an impulse to try came to me at 11
exactly—so I try.)
[M.] It is such a pity to break the chain — Since you were out
in the morning yesterday why didn't you try in the afternoon

A few minutes steadily each day are not much to ask from you

I want to be able to write steadily not in these fitful snatches

You need not have the old-fashioned fear that this kind of thing

pathies and sharpen your powers of understanding— It will make
your spirit keep in step with great powers instead of hurrying

—
(The joined writing rather worries me —is it quite essential ?)
Yes it saves time and when the thread of connection is finer
than any strand of gossamer one must not run the risk of breaking it.
[G.] I can't help feeling vexed or rather angry at the half-
hearted way in which you go in for this—you should either take it
or leave it — If you don't care enough to try every day for a short
time better drop it altogether. It's like making appointments and
not keeping them. You endanger your own powers of sensitiveness

motor impulse comes purely from without— You have got to write
and the proof will presently be in what you write not in how it is

a good deal to do with it Seven years is about the limit for easy

:
(This was written with the left hand. Held up to the glass it reads
" Mary—Yes 1 know this has tired your hand he is so full of energy
but you will soon get used to that.")
[M.J Your hand gets tired soon because it is not passive
enough— make it limp At present the whole arm has to be
moved from the elbow — It is only your wrist and fingers that
need move really.

If I could write it now with my present knowledge • no one

That was quite the right line to take up with the R. of R.'s

than that— L.'s letter was far too gentle to meet the case 2
(I do not like writing of this sort. It makes me feel worried when
real things I have read of are referred to.)

you dislike it only mite.

This paragraph refers to the alleged prediction of the assassination of the
King of Servia which took place in June, 1903. An account of the prediction
was published in the Review of Reviews, July, 1903. In the next month's
issue, Mr. W. T. Stead attacked the officers of the S.P.R. for having dropped
the investigation of the case after finding the evidence for it worthless. In
the September number appeared a letter from Sir Oliver Lodge in defence
of the attitude of the Society.

This refers to the letter to me, enclosing the script of November 7th. The

This is quoted in the essay on "Modern Poets and Cosmic Law" in a
volume of essays by Mr. Myers called Science and a Future Life (p. 205).
The reference in the script after this quotation to the use of the word "ghost"
recalled to me Mr. Myers's rather peculiar use of it as equivalent to " Holy
Ghost" in his poem, The Translation of Faith:
" High in the midst the pictured Pentecost
Showed in a sign the coming of the Ghost,"

has weakened the messages ever since

This passage shows that the man seen by Mrs. Holland
in a mind's-eye vision on November 7th, as described in her
script of that day, quoted above, was identified by her at the
time as Mr. Myers. I have already explained that this was
a misrecognition. Two short passages from other controls

[M.] Lodge was mistaken in thinking that telepathy need depend
upon immediate proximity 1 — The truest telergic power is quite
apart from contact or propinquity— It will be a good test for
people utterly unknown to you to send you a message from
thousands of miles—I hope they will do this— I cannot reach
them.

you need only write. Do try to forget your abiding fear of being
made a fool or a dupe— If we ever prompt you to fantastic
follies you may leave us— But we only wish you to give us a
few passive patient minutes each day. It's a form of restless

In the above is another specific reference to Lord Bute's
heart being buried in the Holy Land, and it will be noticed
that later on two lines from Shelley's Adonais are quoted.
In Mr. Myers's obituary notice of Lord Bute printed in the
Journal S.P.B. for November, 1900 (Vol. IX., p. 310), he
speaks of the hall at Mount Stuart " encircled with a trans-
lucent zone which pictured the constellations of the Ecliptic
;
—the starry lights represented by prisms inserted in that
'
dome of many-coloured glass.' " When I met Mrs. Holland
about two years later, I showed her (November 16th, 1905)
this quotation in the Journal. She told me that she had
never met Lord Bute, nor, so far as she was aware, heard
of his house, Mount Stuart, which is at Bothesay, Isle of
Bute.
"My Houses—my dear House, etc.," obviously refers to
the Bowton Houses.
"May 9th, 1872, etc.," is a reminiscence of Human Per-
sonality (see Vol. II., p. 223). "It was on May 9th, 1874 [not
1872] that Edmund Gurney and I met Stainton Moses for
the first time, through the kindness of Mrs. Cowper-Temple
(afterwards Lady Mount-Temple) . .
." Mrs. Holland told me
in October, 1905, that she had met Lady Mount-Temple once,
she thought in 1900. It was towards the end of her life,
when she had left Broadlands (where Mr. Myers knew her).
There are several other references to Lady Mount-Temple and
friends of hers later in the script.
" H.C.T." The first Mrs. Cowper-Temple was named Harriet
Alicia. It was the second one whom Mr. Myers knew.

(The writing ceased at 11.5.)
The theory here expressed as to the true nature of a
" ghost " is no doubt derived from the first part of the chapter
on " Phantasms of the Dead," in Human Personality, Vol. II.
(see especially pp. 3-10). But Mrs. Verrall points out to me
the rather remarkable use of the words " eidolon " and " simul-
acrum," which do not occur in that chapter. The word
"Eidolon" first occurs in Mrs. Holland's script on Nov. 7th,
1903, in the communication addressed to Mrs. Verrall and
quoted above (see p. 187). It is followed by some illegible
scribbles, evidently representing an attempt to write Greek. A
few Greek characters are distinguishable, but no complete
words ; in fact, the whole effect is, I think, less like Greek
than would have been produced by a person ignorant of the
language who was deliberately trying to write it from his
visual memory of Greek phrases met with in English books.
These scribbles are followed by the words : Timor mortis.

216 Alice Johnson. [part
On " Eidolon " and " Simulacrum," Mrs. Verrall writes
:
Homer (Odyssey, XL 601) describes how Odysseus met in Hades
"great Herakles, his phantom (eiScoAov) ; himself (avrbs) rejoices amid
the immortals, etc." It is a famous passage, as the question of how
Herakles came to be in Hades has been much discussed. It is the
passage alluded to by Plotinus, in the extract quoted in Unman
Personality, Vol. II., p. 290.
But the point as regards Mrs. Holland's script is the scholarly
and correct classical use of the words eidolon and simulacrum. This,
for instance, is Merry's note on another passage in the Odyssey,
XL 213, where the eidolon of Odysseus' mother is allowed by
Persephone to come :
" et'ScoAoi/ is best represented by our word
'phantom.' It is used almost identically with t^xv (spirit), as the
immaterial ghost that remains when the body is dead. But it
implies more than the notion of ^i>x7
)> fi rst as conveying the idea
of something unreal and illusive, and secondly as presenting a
visible though unsubstantial copy of the person whom it represents.
Thus [then various illustrations]. But the strongest passage for
deciding the use of the word, as meaning the unreal and phantom
image, is XL 601 [passage about Herakles], where the contrast
between eiocoAov and auros (the man himself) is vividly brought out.
. . . This notion of eiSwAoi/ has many points in common with the
Lucretian simulacra."
While we should not expect this usage to be known to one who
was not a classical scholar, it would be likely to be familiar
to readers of Homer and Lucretius, and in the quotation from
Plotinus in Human Personality we have direct proof (if it were
wanted) that Mr. Myers knew the passage in the XL Odyssey, the
locus classicus for the special use of eiSwAov.
Odysseus' meeting with the spirit of his mother in Hades is
referred to in Human Personality, Vol. II., p. 256, where two
lines from the Odyssey (XI. 88, 89) are quoted. The words
in question do not occur in these lines.
The passage from Plotinus. referred to by Mrs. Verrall, is
thus translated in Human Personality (Vol. II. p. 290): "The
shade of Herakles, indeed, may talk of his own valour to the
shades ; but the true Herakles in the true world will deem all
that of little worth. . .
."
Another version which is likely to be familiar to Mrs.
Holland is the following
:
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter II. 217
" And as the auld-farrand hero sees
In Hell a bode Hercules
Pit there the lesser deid to please,
While he himsel'
Dwells with the muckle gods at ease
Far raised frae hell." 1
But in neither of these versions does the word e'!$w\oi> or
simulacrum occur. See below (script of Jan. 8th, 1904) for
further references to the " simulacre," " phantasm," and
" eidolon."
(Jan. 7th. 6.50 p.m.)
[M.] There is no sadder mistake than to imagine that by mourn-

unkind but it is really the truest kindness— While you are alone

—
You might easily waste all your kind endeavour—your strength
and time in noting only names—dates —vague words—never the
same influence twice. That must be avoided— Believe me sense
and kindness prompts this— Cease to write again for a few days
or weeks if you cannot resist this flock of crying passing influences
—
They will have an injurious effect on you if you yield to them —
Your feeling of faintness and sickness this morning before I wrote

healthy spirit—a healthy nature.

notes: "I stopped at 7.15; the messages seemed unreal somehow
and too short."]
(Friday, Jan. 8th. 7 p.m.)
.... [M.] The appearance of the simulacre [sic] does not
necessarily imply that the spirit is consciously present. It may
project the phantasm from a great distance. More usually however
it is present. On two occasions only I myself have been able to
perceive the surroundings I so desired to see—once [illegible] at a
Meeting and you all appeared to me as flat cardboard figures seen
through a grey mist— The next time was a few weeks ago at
home . . .
I would try so hard on the anniversary that is only nine days
away now if I could be sure that you really wished and desired
my eidolon without any fear or reluctance
Any terror would distress me unspeakably.
In my present state thoughts pain me more than wounds or
burns could do while I lived— It is part of the stage through
which I pass an evolutionary phase. . . .
This script seems to show a possible connection with Mrs.
Verrall's of December 10th, 1901 (see Mrs. Verrall's Eeport,
in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XX., p. 213) in which the following
occurs
:
Betwixt dark and light a gray figure in the bedroom not [to be
feared] 1
you will see on an anniversary —note the date—this year.
Put the [conversation] on [paper] that is all I can see. Try other
nights.
Here, then, is the same idea of a phantasm, not to be
feared, to be seen on an anniversary—which in Mrs. Holland's
script is indicated as that of Mr. Myers's death, January 17th.
Mrs. Verrall's script of Dec, 10th, 1901, also showed con-
nection with that of Mrs. Piper, for on January 28th, 1902, at
a sitting of Dr. Hodgson's with Mrs. Piper in America, reference
was made by the Myers control to a "vision" of a figure which
it was said had been seen recently by Miss Verrall. As a

Mrs. Holland's script.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter III. 219
matter of fact, no such vision was seen either by Mrs. or Miss
Verrall during this period. But at the same sitting with Mrs.
Piper on January 28th, 1902, the control arranged with Dr.
Hodgson to try a definite experiment in appearing to Miss
Verrall, and on February 4th claimed that he had succeeded
in making himself visible to her. Again the attempt failed, but
a remarkable connection appeared between the circumstances of
the supposed vision and some script of Mrs. Verrall's produced
on January 31st, 1902 (see her Report, pp. 213-17). All
this, of course, happened without any knowledge on the part
of either automatist as to the doings of the other.
CHAPTER III.
First Cross-Correspondence with Mrs. Verrall :
The Selwyn Text Incident.
In this chapter I have put together passages in Mrs. Holland's
script of December, 1903, and January, 1904, with certain
passages in Mrs. Verrall's script of about the same period
which seem to be more or less directly connected with them,
though, owing to the fact that I did not see Mrs. Verrall's
script at the time, no connection was discovered till nearly
two years later.
A summary of the circumstances will enable the reader
to appreciate better the connection between the two scripts.
At this time (about the end of 1903), I knew only of
a few incidents in Mrs. Verrall's script and had seen very
little of it. Nothing had been published on the subject
;
but Mrs. Verrall had read two papers about it at Private
Meetings of the Society, on October 17th, 1902, and April
20th, 1903, brief abstracts of which had been printed in
the Journal S.P.R. for November, 1902, and May, 1903.
During the latter part of 1903, as stated in Mrs. Verrall's
Report on her script (published in October, 1906, Proceedings
S.P.R., Vol. XX.—See especially, pp. 295-298 and 419-423),
repeated efforts were made in it to give a message from
Dr. Sidgwick about three letters. On October 10th, 1903,
220 Alice Johnson. [part
Mrs. Verrall was instructed by the script to ask Mrs. Sidgwick
to give her a " test question " to be answered by it, after
which further evidence was to be expected. Mrs. Verrall
acting on this instruction, received from Mrs. Sidgwick the
question :
" What was the last of Dr. Sidgwick's texts,—the
one that belonged to the latter part of his life ?
" The
question referred to a subject unknown to Mrs. Verrall, and
thus described in the Memoir of Dr. Sidgwick (p. 125):
" During most of his adult life Sidgwick had some text—
a
different one at different periods—which ran in his head,
representing the key-note, so to speak, of his thought about
his own life. [Four texts belonging to the earlier periods are
then given.] Finally, from about 1890, 'Gather up the
fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.'
1 " The Memoir
was not published till the end of February, 1906, and at this
time Dr. Sidgwick's texts can only have been known to his
nearest relatives.
Mrs. Verrall told no one that she had received this question
from Mrs. Sidgwick, and her script was—for evidential purposes
—sent to Sir Oliver Lodge, as it was produced, in envelopes
which he filed and kept unopened. The script now began a
long series of allusions to Faith, Hope and Charity and their
comparative merits, quoting part of I Cor. xiii. 13 ("And now
abideth faith, hope, charity, these three ; but the greatest of
these is charity "), and finally attaching special value to the
virtue of Hope. Mrs. Verrall thought that these passages-
might be an attempt to describe the contents of a sealed
envelope—perhaps one of the three letters already referred
to—left by Dr. Sidgwick ; or might merely represent guesses
of the subliminal self, started by the suggestion that a text
was wanted.
On December 11th, 1903, Dr. and Mrs. Verrall went to
Algeria, and the writing was continued there. On December
25th, it stated that she was to ask the question on the 17th
of next month, and a reference closely following to " Sidgwick's
message," made it clear that the question meant was the one
about the text. Further this script quotes a text similar in
meaning to the one required, viz. :
" Use the daylight hours,
for the night cometh when no man may work."
1
St. John, vi. 12.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter III. 221
The admonition to write on the 17th was repeated on
January 9th, 1904, and on January 17th, remarks about S,
a letter, an envelope and a seal, and the words " not without
hope " were followed by the statement :
" The question is
answered," and later by :
" The text and the answer are one
and are "iven." Nevertheless, no definite statement as to a
text ivas given in this script, but again, on May 11th, 1904,
the script gave a clue which led Mrs. Verrall to a second
paraphrase of the text required.
The passages in the script, though relating to Dr. Sidgwick,
purported in general to come from Mr. Myers.
Meanwhile Mrs. Holland, in India, was sending her script
to me, and I occasionally showed passages of it to Mr.
Piddington, but (at this time) to no one else. Throughout
the autumn of 1903 her script (large portions of which have
been already quoted), expresses a strong desire on the part
of the " controls " to communicate, which becomes specially
intense in January, 1904, when it is stated on January 12th
that some special message is to be transmitted to Mr. Myers's
friends. The climax comes on January 17th, 1 904,—the
day on which, as we have just seen, Mrs. Verrall's script
refers to a sealed envelope, and states that the question is
answered and the text given. On this day Mrs. Holland's
script refers (1) to an attempt to get a message through,
(2) to a sealed envelope, and (3) to a text, giving the reference
only, I. Cor. xvi. 13 ("Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit
you like men, be strong ").
This text, though not the one asked for by Mrs. Sidgwick,
has a certain special association with Mr. Myers and Mrs.
Verrall, to be explained below.
Apart from the similarity of topics in both scripts on
January 17th, 1904, there are a number of minor corre-
spondences between them during the whole period.
Both writers refer beforehand to the date, Jan. 17th, 1904.
The Holland-Myers (if I may coin the term) is clearly looking
forward to this as the anniversary of his death (see references
on Nov. 20th, p. 203, Dec. 1st, 1903, p. 230, and Jan. 8th,
1904, p. 218); the Verrall-Myers gives two specific directions
(on Dec. 25th, 1903, and Jan. 9th, 1904) to write on Jan.
17th. Mr. Myers attached great importance to anniversaries, a
222 Alice Johnson, [part
fact which was probably known to Mrs. Verrall and certainly
unknown to Mrs. Holland. Both knew the date of his death,
and this might have led to both producing writing on that
clay; but it can hardly be held to account for the similarity
between the two writings.
In both cases references are made to the difficulty of one
sensitive working alone and the advantages of co-operation
(Mrs. Holland, Sept. 21st, Nov. 7th, Dec. 1st and 5th, 1903;
Mrs. Verrall, Oct. 12th and 19th, and Dec. 7th, 1903).
Mrs. Verrall is told (Oct. 19, 1903) that evidence will
come to her later through others ; and Mrs. Holland (Jan.
5th, 1904) that the message has a meaning not for her,
but for others, and, though the " others " are not specified,
that each automatist is to supplement statements given through
the other is a natural interpretation.
There is a certain resemblance between the descriptions of
their own attitude given by the controls through both sensitives.
The Verrall-Myers speaks (Dec. 29th, 1903) of the voice
of one crying in the wilderness; the Holland-Myers (Jan 5th,
1904) of words said, shouted, sung to the wind, and again
(on Jan. 12th, 1904), of one wailing as the wind wails,
wordless and unheeded. The Holland-Myers (Jan. 6th, 1904)
refers to the missionary spirit longing to speak to the souls
in prison ; the Verrall-Myers, in a very obscure passage (Feb.
2nd, 1904), to slaves in prison, and prodigies done by the
pure, presumably on their behalf.
Further, the Verrall-Myers remarks (Dec. 27, 1903):
" Comes the message, but is not understanded of any " ; and
the Holland-Myers (on Jan. 27th, 1904) expresses his bitter
disappointment that the message, on which apparently so
much effort had been spent, had not made any real impression
on his friends.
This is strikingly appropriate, since, as a matter of fact,
it was not until October, 1905, that any correspondence was
discovered between the two series of scripts, while the minor
resemblances were not observed till I was preparing this
report for publication.
I now give in full the passages referred to, quoting in both
cases from the original writings, since Mrs. Verrall has kindly
lent me the whole of her script for the purposes of this

the Latin and Greek phrases in her script, which I have
put into the text in round brackets, giving the original
Latin or Greek in foot-notes.
I. From Mrs. Verrall's Script.
(September 22nd, 1903.) . . . Henry Sidgwick has a message to
give before Christmas, through you if possible. In his envelope is
a drawing, a curved line, on one side of the paper, and a word or
two on the other side LT
nto this end—that is the idea—unto
this last .... But you must give another message correctly first
and then ask her to open my envelope. 1
(October 7th, 1903.) . . . Henry Sidgwick's message is next to come;
it is about 3 letters kept together not of the same date ; two are
in the original envelopes, but the third is loose. I can't see whose
the letters are, but he valued them. Just these three were always
together— More about that later—it will be quite clear to you.
Tell Piddington to ask Mrs. Thompson about Sidgwick's three
envelopes.
Myers sent this word.

(October 10th, 1903.) . . . You are not right yet about Sidgwick's
message—do not hurry. Ask Mrs. Sidgwick if she can tell you a
question to put at the first chance. You will be in direct com-
munication with one of us soon and should be able to ask a
question about Sidgwick to which she knows the answer and you
do not. Let this be your test.
[Here follows an apparent attempt to give the contents of one of
the three letters.]

Don't ask Mrs. Sidgwick yet—See Mrs. Thompson first if you
can— It is much easier when some one else helps. You have
not got it right yet

Mrs. Verrall then asked Mrs. Sidgwick to give her a test
question, and on October 18th, 1903, received from her the

question :
" What was the last of Dr. Sidgwick's texts,—the
one that belonged to the latter part of his life ?
"
On October 19 th and following days, as stated above, the
script contains a long series of allusions to Faith, Hope and
Charity and their comparative merits, special value being
attached to the virtue of Hope. Among references to these
and various other topics occur the following passages, which
1 quote as having a possible connection with some of Mrs.
Holland's script.

The sentence :
" Use the daylight hours, for the night
cometh when no man may work," may perhaps be regarded
as a paraphrase of Dr. Sidgwick's text :
" Gather up the frag-
ments, etc.
;
" for it seems marked out by the words that
follow it: "That is not for you, but for identification;" meaning
(apparently) that it is intended for an evidential message.

Mrs. Verrall had already had some successful experiments with Mrs. Dew-
Smith and others of her friends.

Mrs. Verrall heard from Dr. Hodgson on January 20th, 1904, that he had
recognised in her script certain evidential points. —See her Report, p. 308.

Let them try but do not be discouraged if they fail ;

Let things come ; wait and do not guess. . . .
Next comes an exhortation to listen to a voice crying in the
wilderness,—the voice, presumably, of the control endeavouring
to deliver his message.
(Dec. 29, 1903. 5 p.m. Hammam Rhira.)
(In latin : Patience—things lie open to those who have patience.
Oh ye who fear, listen now to the voice of one crying and pro-
claiming in desert places. Ye shall see soon things never seen
before, ye shall receive with your ears things never heard—through
long ages the truth shall endure. 3
) . . .
Before going on to the script next in chronological order,
I may observe that this passage seems to represent the com-
pletion of the idea of a voice crying in the wilderness which
had first emerged in a totally different connection on Oct.
5th, 1903. On that date (see below) the script is dealing
with the two constellations of Ariadne's crown and Berenice's
hair, and involves an interesting cross-correspondence with
Mrs. Piper, as related in Mrs. Verrall's Beport (pp. 308-9 and
427-29). It contains two side-allusions—apparently arising
from association of ideas : Berenice's hair suggests " Mary
Magdalene and the nard," and Ariadne, deserted and lamenting,
seems to suggest the voice crying in the wilderness—for the
Vulgate phrase vox clamantis is applied to her on Oct. 5th,
while it is used more in its original sense on Dec. 29th.
I italicise in this extract the words relating to this aspect
of Ariadne.

name shows the meaning. Receive —receive, after fury peace, out
of darkness a great light, silence helps. 1
)
Returning now to the main topic, the next script to be
quoted is the following
:
(Jan. 9, 1904. 6 p.m. Hammam Rhira.)
(In Latin: Be sure you write upon the 17th day. 2

quite right, but it is about Hope's vision which is the true one and
leads on the Passionate Pilgrim.
(Note on the above script, written by Mrs. Verrall on January 18th,
1904.)
Before writing I slept, and in my sleep I seemed to be getting
the contents of a sealed envelope of Mr. Myers for Sir 0. J. L.
So I put the question before writing (cf. script of Dec. 25, 1903).
" What is in F. W. H. M.'s letter in the charge of Dr. Hodgson ?
"
that being the envelope about which I have long thought the script
had been writing. But the words of this script— Jan. 17 —-seem to
refer to an envelope of H. S. in Mrs. S.'s charge ; and the " question
"
may be the one referred to in sc. of Oct. 10. . . . Cf. also Oct. 19,
21, 23, Nov. 17 for Hope—and earlier scripts (about Sept., 1903) for
contents of Envelope.
I regard the script of January 17th, 1904, as the climax
of this particular cross-correspondence, such as it is ; but I
quote next a later passage which seems to show a possible
connection with Mrs. Holland's script of Jan. 6th, 1904
(see p. 231), for the last words: "Find this—it happened—it
is a clue," appear to indicate that some connection is to be
looked for. The passage begins by describing the utterances
of a prophetic and oracular voice —perhaps a variant of the
voice crying in the wilderness—and goes on to speak of a
large prison, in which slaves are confined.
(February 2nd, 1904.)
(In latin and Greek : When I greatly wish, I cannot express to
you what I want to say. Wait for the cry 111
; then though you
have been undone, out of your error you will reach the end.

Find this it happened, it is a clue.
For completeness, though there is in it no direct connection
with Mrs. Holland's script, I give a passage from a still later
script of Mrs. Verrall's, which gave her a clue to another
paraphrase of Dr. Sidgwick's text.
(May 11th, 1904.). ... It was a flat green book, lying edgwise on

Mrs. Verrall appends the following notes on the words italicised in the above
translation :
December 4th, 1907.
(1) mugionem, a false form, obviously meant for the noun from mugire, which
means "to low, or bellow,'' and is used («) of cattle, (6) of the sound of the
trumpet, (c) the creaking of spars in a gale, {d) of thunder. It corresponds to
the Greek nvKa.op.ai, which is used in much the same senses, but seems to be
specially associated, at least once, with the Erinyes. But the word is not used
of the utterance of an oracle nor of any articulate voice.
(2) mox adveniet, etc. Here are unmistakeable allusions to an oracle.
(a) mox adveniet recalls a similar phrase in script of March 21, 1901 (Pro-
ceedings, XX. 42) which definitely speaks of the Cumaean Sibyl.
(/<) fatidica appears as an epithet of four divinities (Roscher's Lexicon;
Supplement on Latin Epithets of Divinities), all of them speakers of oracles : viz.
Carnientis, a prophetess : Virg. Aen. VIII. 339, 40. Manto, a prophetess : Virg.
A<:n. X. 199. Sibylla, the prophetess: Silius, Ital. 17. 2; Statius, SUvae, III.
5. 97. Ausonius, p. 204. (I have never read these three : Silius, Statius,
Ausonius.) Themis, the original "proprietor of the Delphian Oracle." Ovid,
Met. I. 321.
" fatidicam Themin, quae tunc oracla tenebat."
The word means "prophetic, oracular, Sibylline"; Dr. Verrall, asked to
translate, said "oracular."
(c) comata recalls the loose hair of the Sibyl (Virg. Aen. VI. 48) which was
—
as part of the ritual —taken out of its fastenings before she prophesied.
(d) xf
'P°'s ayvats, also recalls the preliminary lustrations.
Erinys is not an oracular being, but she is underground. The word seems a
sheer blunder—not at all what my normal self would do.
(3) 6/j.<pa\7]s is an impossible word, but the intention is clear. There is a
combination of d/i07j = a divine voice, and 6^0aX6s = the navel stone at Delphi.

second paragraph That will the words she wants in answ [here an
interruption occurred, after which the writing was resumed :]
[draw-
ings of a cross, heart and anchor] and the greatest of these three
Write the other words. . . .
It is clear that the latter part of this script is recurring
to the notion of faith, hope and charity, several times repeated
in the earlier passages quoted above, and it is noteworthy that
the words from " Take it and open " to the end are in the
handwriting of the Sidgwick control, i.e., in a hand resembling
Dr. Sidgwick's own (which was well known to Mrs. Verrall).
These points seem to mark it out as belonging to the series
of incidents now under discussion.
On November 16th, 1906, Mrs. Verrall learnt for the first
time of certain connections between her script of 1903-4 and
Mrs. Piper's of the same period, and this led her to investigate
further the script just quoted. The description of the book
suggested to her a " Temple Classic," since one set of the
books in that series are fiat (i.e. thin) and green, with flexible
bindings and wide margins. As the script was in the hand-
writing of the Sidgwick control, she asked Mrs. Sidgwick on
November 21st, 1906, if she had any "Temple Classics." Two
This last word is regularly used for Delphi itself as the seat of prophecy. The

Megasth'enes = greatly strong, and is applied by Aeschylus, in a well-known
passage, to an oracle. In another well-known passage of Aeschylus {Seven against
Thebes) the Erinys is said to be Megasthenes, and in a third she is called
Kakomantis (prophet of evil). This is perhaps enough to account for my
subliminal dragging in Erinys, when it was blundering about over Megas and
Prophetess.
Megasterion does not exist.
Megastulon does not exist.
Ergasterion is a Labour prison, and Megergasterion would be a perfectly good
word for a Large Labour Prison.
Megergastulon is not a bad word for the same thing.

being produced, Mrs. Verrall selected for certain reasons a
Marcus Aurelius, and took it home with her to investigate.
It had a ribbon marker at which she opened it, and found
that the " second paragraph " was Chapter XVII. of Book I.
The marginal heading to that chapter (printed on the following
page) was "Go about each action as if thy last." 1
This again (like the text quoted in Mrs. Verrall's script of
December 25th, 1903) may fairly be regarded as a paraphrase
of Dr. Sidgwick's text :
" Gather up the fragments that remain
etc.," and it was by following the directions given in her
script that Mrs. Verrall found it, among the marginal sum-
maries, which " are short and broken." It should be noted,
however, that before finding it (though not before writing the
script which led her to it) Mrs. Verrall knew what Dr.
Sidgwick's text was.
It may be worth adding that the Marcus Aurelius was not
given to Mrs. Sidgwick till some time after the deaths of
Dr. Sidgwick and Mr. Myers, so that if the information came
from either of them, it was not a case of recollection.

am so powerless to tell what means so much— I cannot get into

This seems to express the same idea of the advantage of
co-operation between several sensitives as is expressed in
Mrs. Verrall's script of Oct. 12th and 19th and Dec. 7th, and
the idea recurs in Mrs. Holland's script of Dec. 5th (quoted
in full above, p. 211) as follows:
I fear you will never be really responsive trying alone —at least
not to influences unknown to you while they lived. You need the
connecting bond.

In-
the passage next to be quoted, the original script shows
signs of emotional strain and intensity impossible to reproduce
in a printed copy. The Gurney control, writing in pencil,
tells the automatist that her hand will be left alone, and she
is to write down a message transmitted to her brain. He
then tells her to take a pen. She does so and the passage
that follows is in her own ordinary hand-writing. Then she
breaks off, noting " I am very restless, etc." The script begins
again in the writing of the Myers control, complaining that
she is not giving the method of experiment a fair trial.
Thus urged, she makes a fresh attempt in her ordinary hand-
writing and gives—not quite correctly—the first two lines of
Mr. Myers's poem, St. Paul. (Mrs. Holland told me later
that she had never read this poem, and was quite unaware
till I told her that she had quoted from it in her script.
Nevertheless she supposes, as I do, that she had probably
seen these lines quoted somewhere, and that she reproduced
them from her subliminal memory.) After some general
reflections, the hand-writing gradually changes again, as if
by an overpowering impulse, into that of the Myers control,
expressing with passionate energy his desire to " reach you
—
reach anyone." Here the writing becomes large and emphatic,
then stops dead, and the Gurney control resumes in pencil,
" Why did you let your hand yield ? You have stopped and
exhausted him now . .
." The automatist notes that this
script has tired her more than any she has ever done.
The full text is as follows :

Here, then, as in Mrs. Verrall's script of the same date,
quoted above (see p. 226), are references to a sealed letter and
to a text. The text to which Mrs. Holland's script gives the
reference is :
" Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like
men, be strong
;
'"
and the script says :
" I am unable to make
your hand form Greek characters and so I cannot give the
text as I wish, only the reference." This text, as we have
seen, is not and has no sort of connection with the text asked
for by Mrs. Sidgwick which Mrs. Verrall's script was trying
to produce. But it is the text inscribed (with the omission
of the last two words " be strong ") in Greek over the
gateway of Selwyn College, Cambridge, which would be passed
in going from Mr. Myers's house to Mrs. Verrall's, or to the
rooms in Newnham College where Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick
lived. The road in which Mrs. Verrall lives is named Selwyn
Gardens, after Selwyn College. The Greek inscription over
the Selwyn gateway has an error in it—the omission of a mute
letter—on which Mr. Myers had more than once remarked to
Mrs. Verrall.
The fact that this text (without the reference to Corinthians)
turns up in the script again, more than a year later, and also
in connection with Mrs. Verrall (see below, p. 253), but before
Mrs. Holland knew that there was any significance in its first
appearance, suggests strongly that it is not a mere chance
allusion. Mrs. Holland has never been in Cambridge and has, I

believe, few friends or acquaintances having any connection
with it. These trivial details of the locality where Mr. Myers
lived are of course more or less familiar to other people living
in the same neighbourhood, but it is very unlikely that they
would crop up in casual conversation outside Cambridge.
It may be noted that a strong desire is expressed in Mrs.
Holland's script that this " message " should be sent to Mr.
Myers's friends, as if it were a specially important one. The
only previous occasion on which this request was specially made
was in the script of November 7th, 1903 (quoted above,
p. 186), when Mrs. Verrall's name and address were given,
and which also contains a certain amount of evidential matter.
The last script to be quoted in this connection was sent to
me with some other in a letter dated March 10th, 1904, in
which Mrs. Holland writes :
" I enclose a final page of very
incoherent writing. I have steadily resisted every impulse to
write since Feb. 11th, for I am very busy now and interruptions
(while writing) jarred on me painfully."

This expression of disappointment at our failure to appreciate
and respond to the effort that had been made from the other
side is strikingly appropriate to the circumstances. At this
time it had not occurred to me to enquire whether any corre-
spondences existed between Mrs. Holland's and Mrs. Verrall's
scripts, and it was not until October, 1905,—after the series
of experiments to be related below,—that I told Mrs. Verrall of
the statement in Mrs. Holland's script of Jan. 1 7th, 1904,
that the sealed envelope was not to be opened yet, and asked
her to look up her own script of that date to see if there
was any coincidence.
Later, when Mrs. Verrall's original script was put into my
possession, I made an exhaustive comparison of it over the
whole of this period. I give a summary of the results in a
tabular form, showing the four topics on which there were
more or less definite correspondences between passages in the
two series of scripts.

One more point is perhaps worth mentioning. The reader
who compares the general character of the two scripts can
hardly fail to notice the emotional nature and the note of
personal appeal in the utterances of the Holland-Myers as
contrasted with the calmer, more impersonal, and more matter-
of-fact tone of the Verrall-Myers.
The contrast may, of course, represent nothing more than
a difference in the automatists' own conceptions of the per-
sonality ;
for, on any reasonable view of the facts, it is I think
inevitable that the presentation of the personality should be
largely coloured by their normal knowledge of its supposed
original.
Still, it may be admitted that if Mr. Myers really knew
what was going on and if he was really concerned in the
production of the scripts, it would be natural and appropriate
that he should attempt to impress the two automatists in these
different ways. •
Mrs. Verrall, a personal friend and trained
investigator, was already familar with scientific methods and
in close touch with other investigators. She did not require
urging to go on with her writing, from which some important
evidence had already resulted.
Mrs. Holland, on the other hand, was in an isolated position ;
she was conscious of the superficially trivial and incoherent
nature of her script, and could not tell whether there was
anything in it beyond a dream-like richauffe" of her own
thoughts. She would naturally shrink from exposing this to
strangers and thereby appearing to attach an unreasonable
degree of importance to it. We may suppose then that the
control realises her situation and tries to impress on her a
vivid realisation of his own,—his intense desire to provide
evidence of survival. The reiterations in her script as compared
with Mrs. Verrall's,—a point brought out rather strikingly in
the summary,—denotes perhaps that a more strenuous effort
is required in her case, in order that she may be persuaded to
message, but is not under-
standed of any
as if I had made any true
impression upon them.

disregard her own feelings and risk misunderstanding for the
sake of a remotely possible good.
As to the validity of this explanation, I feel that I cannot
do better than quote Mrs. Holland's own impressions, mentioned
to me later. In a letter dated Feb. 25th, 1905, she says:
" I cannot tell you how glad I should be to know if the long-
ing for recognition (it is such a passionate craving sometimes
that I find myself crying out :
'
If I could help you —Oh ! if
I could only help you
!
' while I write) is a real influence
from beyond or only my own imaginings. But why should
my imagination take that form ? I have been singularly free
from bereavements thus far in my life and therefore my
thoughts have been very seldom in the Valley of the
Shadow . . .
.
"
In Nov. 1905, when I had asked her to read through the
early script and send me any comments that occurred to her,
she notes among other things :
" This sloping writing [that of
the Myers control] often brings a very sad impression of great
depression with it,—a feeling as if some one was calling to
deaf ears."
Still later, in a letter dated July 4th, 1907, she speaks
of " a feeling that sometimes comes in connection with the
script,—a feeling that some one, somewhere, urgently and
passionately desires to be understood, or reported even without
understanding, and that no mental strain on my part can
adequately respond to this demand. This feeling has been
strong enough to make me cry and to make me speak aloud.
I do not often dwell upon it. I frequently control it, for it
seems to me perilously akin to hysteria ; but it is a very
real part of automatic script."
CHAPTEE IV.
January to August, 1905.
Second Period—January 16th to February 28th, 1905.
In April, 1904, Mrs. Holland left India, and I did not hear
from her again until February, 1905, when she wrote to me
as follows :
—
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter IV. 241

... I have discontinued any practice of automatic writing for
nearly a year, as the shock and jar of any chance interruption
seemed out of all proportion to the value of anything I obtained.
However this morning I had an unexpected impulse to write
—
sentences which as usual mean nothing to me personally—and I
enclose the ''message," together with a sudden scribble which came
one evening last month.
The two pieces of script enclosed were :

Was never given voice
I am the dumb musician
Who made no hearts rejoice
I went down to the silence
My years but half fulfilled

The empty hands unskilled.
I will tell you who wrote that— He came away about 16 years
ago— He was very tall thin to emaciation—a tender humourous [sic]
whimsical face with eyes that smiled oftener than his mouth. He
was less than forty when he died and a great many people loved
him They called him Edmund.1

Mrs. Holland had seen Mr. Myers's posthumous Fragments of Prose and
Poetry, containing a portrait of Mr. Gurney and obituary notice of him in
which his interest in music was mentioned, shortly before this script was
produced. See below for further discussion of the effect of this book on her
script.

(The writing ceased at 10.30.)
The reference here is obviously to an experiment with a
sealed envelope left by Mr. Myers with Sir Oliver Lodge.
As members of the Society are aware, various statements had
been made in Mrs. Verrall's script during 1904 about the
contents of this envelope. It was opened on December
13th, 1904, and its contents were then found to have no
resemblance to what was alleged about it in the script. An
account of this experiment was printed in the Journal S.P.R.
for January 1905, which came out on January 17th. The
Westminster Gazette of the same clay contained a paragraph
stating briefly the facts given in the Journal, and this para-
graph was widely copied into other English papers. Mrs.
Verrall's name was not mentioned in the newspaper accounts,
only Sir Oliver Lodge's, and similarly his name, and not
Mrs. Verrall's, appears in Mrs. Holland's script. All these
facts being of course familiar to me, I concluded that Mrs.
Holland had most probably seen one of the newspaper
accounts of the incident. I therefore wrote to ask her whether

she had read the script carefully after writing it and whether
it suggested to her anything that she had ever seen in any
printed book or paper ; also whether she was aware of having
heard anything at all in connection with the S.P.R, or any
members of it since coming to England, and if so, what. I
also suggested that in future she should for evidential purposes
note any facts that she happened to hear or read about the
S.P.R. or its members, with the date and source of the infor-
mation. In reply to my letter Mrs. Holland wrote :
—
Feb. 21st, 1905.
I have never been in the habit of carefully reading over the
automatic writing that comes to me, unless I feel a personal appeal
in it. In the case of what I sent you the other day I only
looked carefully at the first words to make sure they were legible.
It was a thing apart from me. However I will in future go over
it carefully and try to trace out any connection. I very seldom
hear the name of your Society mentioned, and as I am in the
habit of concealing the interest I take in it, I never hear any news
concerning it or its members. I have never seen any of the
Proceedings, and Human Personality is the only book in connection
with it that I have ever read.
I remember an article in the December Fortnightly on the "Pro-
gress of Psychical Research " ; but I read it hurriedly, and have
only a vague recollection that it advocated further study.
I will do as you suggest in the future and note anything I may
hear or read about the Society.
I found that the article on " The Progress of Psychical
Research " (by Mr. F. C. S. Schiller) in the Fortnightly Review
for January, 1905, contained no mention of experiments with
sealed envelopes or of Sir Oliver Lodge.
I did not refer, however, to the subject again in writing
to Mrs. Holland, as I was hoping to meet her later, and
thought it would be best to discuss it fully in a personal
interview.
This interview—the first I had with her—took place on
October 6th, 1905, and lasted about 2 A hours, when many
topics in the script were discussed. Among other things I
showed her an early passage describing the circumstances of
the death of a friend of my own, of whom I thought it very
244 Alice Johnson. [part
unlikely that she had ever heard. She said she had no idea
what the writing was about, and remembered nothing of it.
I then began to tell her in full the details of the actual
circumstances. Before I had got far, she suddenly interrupted
me, saying, " Oh, I know all about that—it was so-and-so."
It appeared that she had seen this lady on one occasion only,
happened to know a little about her, and had heard of her
death at the time, rather more than four years before the
script referred to it. She had been unaware, however, of the
reference in the script, which was given in a somewhat veiled
form, till I pointed it out to her.
Later in the interview, I read over to her the script of
February 15th, 1905, quoted above, and asked if it conveyed
any meaning to her. Apparently it did not. I then told
her of the experiment of the sealed envelope and its result
;
that it had been printed in our Journal for January, 1905,
and had at once got into the newspapers, and been widely
copied ; and I asked her if she thought she had seen any
reference to it. She answered very decidedly that she had no
recollection of ever seeing or hearing anything about it till
that moment. I asked if she thought it possible that she
could have forgotten it, if she had read it. She thought this
impossible, as she would certainly have been greatly interested
in it ; she always noticed and read eagerly everything relating
to Mr. Myers. She remembered the passage in Human Per-
sonality recommending such experiments to be made (Vol. II.,
p. 499), and told me of another magazine article she had
read some time ago which she thought might have contained
references to the subject. (I afterwards read this article, and
found in it only a reference to supposed communications from
Mr. Myers through automatic writing.)
At a later interview with Mrs. Holland (May 29th, 1906)
I showed her the paragraph in the Westminster Gazette about
the opening of the sealed envelope, and cross-questioned her
again as to the possibility of her normal knowledge of it. She
repeated that she was certain she had never heard of it till I
told her, and that she thought it quite impossible that she
could have seen it and forgotten it.
I give this incident in full because it cannot fail to appear
suspicious to an outsider, and I know it to be Mrs. Holland's
LV.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter IV. 245
desire to suppress nothing that might lead to an adverse view
of the phenomena. But I may point out that if she had
read any of the newspaper accounts, she must have known
that I also should have read them ; that therefore my
suspicions would be at once excited by what looked like a
reproduction from a source apparently so obvious, and that,
under the circumstances, the script could not be regarded as
evidential. All this, I say, must have been clear to her if she
had seen a newspaper account.
On the other hand, the references to my friend's death
might well appear evidential, as it would have been difficult
for me to find out that she had known of it, unless she had
told me herself. Yet in this case she explained to me at
once the circumstances that had led to her knowledge of it,
as she has clone in many other cases where the source of her
knowledge or apparent knowledge was not obvious to me.
It may be worth adding that, as Mrs. Verrall informs me,
Swinburne's Garden of Proserpine (a quotation from which
appears in the script under discussion) used to be constantly
recited by Mr. Myers at sittings, and that she herself used
often to ask him to recite it.
The next passages illustrate the effect of Mrs. Holland's
normal knowledge on the script. In a letter dated March
6th, 1905, she says: "About articles in papers referring to
the S.P.R., last autumn I remember one in the Morning Post
by Mr. Andrew Lang about some Fragments in prose and
verse (I cannot remember the proper name) by Mr. Myers.
I found the book in a library presently and looked over it,
hoping for something akin to Human Personality, but I was
disappointed. I am certain I have never read anything else
of his."
In another letter (dated February 25th, 1905) she remarked
incidentally :
" Did I tell you that I read very quickly and
am a proverb in my family for '
tearing the heart ' out of a
book or paper in a few minutes ? I fear this habit makes me
very sketchy."
At my first interview with Mrs. Holland on October 6th,
1905, I asked her how long a time she had spent in looking
at Mr. Myers's Fragments of Prose and. Poetry. After con-
Q
246 Alice Johnson. [part
sidering she said she did not think she could have spent more
than 8 or 10 minutes over it; as it was in a library where
people did not sit to read books, but only looked at them, and
turned them over casually.
Nevertheless, the influence of the book is very marked ; it
contains, for instance, portraits of Mr. Myers, Mr. Gurney,
and Dr. Sidgwick, and the result is seen at once in the greater
definiteness of her conception of the controls, whose personal
appearance now begins to be described, though she is apparently
unaware or but half aware of how she came to be acquainted
with it (see below, p. 264).

The above scripts were sent to me in a letter dated February
23rd, 1905, in which Mrs. Holland told me that she was a
little troubled to find that automatic writing was beginning
to make her feel faint or sleepy ; that in November, while
practising it with a friend, as she very rarely did, she had
gone into a trance and spoken automatically for about a quarter
of an hour, and that she was afraid of this becoming a habit.
At the same time she told me that she had a fancy the

writing materials she was now using hindered, instead of
helping, the script, and she begged nie to send her some
paper that had been lying about in my desk and a pen-holder
that I had used for some time. She added :
" It seems silly
to write this, but I feel as if I had to." Of course I sent
what she asked for at once. In regard to her fear of the
trance condition I said that I believed it possible by self-
suggestion to obviate entirely any objections there might be
to it, and I advised her that on sitting down to write she
should suggest to herself strongly and decidedly (1) that she
was not going into a trance ;
(2) that in case she did, she
would retain complete control over herself, so as to be able
to wake at once if desirable, and to do nothing while in the
trance that she would dislike doing when normal ; (3) that if
a trance occurred it would have no bad effects on her physical
condition, but the reverse,—that it would produce the effect
of rest, not of exhaustion.
The suggestion was apparently effective and it was long
before Mrs. Holland noticed any sleepiness in connection with
her script again.
Two more characteristic quotations from the " Myers control
"
of this period may conclude this section.

(This writing took 15 minutes, and at the end of it, when possibly
a signature was intended, my hand gave such jerky convulsive
movements that I was obliged to put down the pen and walk about
the room. Aimless scribbling of this sort has a painful effect on
me and always makes me want to destroy the writing which
contains it.
"The luminous patch, generally egg-shaped" reminds me that
yesterday I was trying to " crystal gaze " in a glass of water, at
a friend's request, and all I saw was a luminous patch of this kind
on a dark background, which presently was replaced by the head
of an elderly man. I noticed a high forehead—greyish hair
—
dark eyes—and I think a short beard ; but it was not very clear.
It was gone very quickly and nothing else came.)
Third Period: March 1st to May 22nd, 1905.
First Series of Experiments with Mrs. Verrall.
I quoted above Mrs. Holland's script of Xov. 25th, 1903,
in which the Gurney control suggested that I should find
" some one with a trained will " to try for a few minutes
every morning for a month to convey an idea or phrase to

her in India, while she was to try to get the impression
through automatic writing. I did not receive this script until
the end of January, 1904, and as Mrs. Holland told me at
about the same time that she was leaving India early in April
for a long visit to Europe, I replied that I thought I could
arrange for experiments of the kind suggested, but that it
might be better to put them off for the present, as she was
likely to be specially busy preparing for her move.
There was a gap of nearly a year in our correspondence
and in her script while she was travelling. I heard from
her again on Feb. 15th, 1905, as related above. Meanwhile
1 kept the suggestion in mind, and on Feb. 24th, 1905, I
wrote to her as follows :
... I should like now to suggest an experiment to you, which
I think might have interesting results. Would you be inclined to
try writing once a week on a certain day, which I would ask you
to fix, and I would then arrange for a friend of mine who is also
an automatic writer to write on the same day, and each of you to
send your writing to me to be compared, when I think it is
possible that some correspondence might be found between the two
sets of writing, or some evidence of telepathy between the writers.
I have suggested this to my friend and she is very willing to try
it. She suggested beginning the experiments as early as possible
in March and continuing once a week, say for six weeks. Then
if the results were successful, it might be worth going on longer.
My friend thought it might be best not to fix the time of day, as
it might be difficult both for her and for you to keep to a regular
hour, whereas if you wrote always on the same day, that would,
I think, be sufficient for practical evidential purposes.
I have not told her your name nor anything about you, except
that I have been receiving automatic writing from you for some
time, and that I thought you did not talk much to any one else
about it. I also mentioned that you lived in India but were now
over here, and that you were married. ... If you will fix a day
of the week and tell me when you will begin, I will ask her to
begin on the same day.
Mrs. Holland replied to me as follows
:
February 25th, 1905.
. . . The experiment you suggest interests me very much and I
should like to try it. Will you ask your friend to begin on next
LV.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter IV. 251
Wednesday, March 1st, and to try writing on each Wednesday in
March and on to April 5th ? If I have a strong impulse to write
on other days, I will not ignore it, but I will only deliberately try
for writing on Wednesdays. . . .
I then arranged that the experiments should begin on
March 1st, the friend with whom I had arranged them being
Mrs. Verrall.
Mrs. Holland knew Mrs. Verrall by name, as she is men-
tioned in Human Personality as " Mrs. A. W. Verrall, a lecturer
at Newnham College," in connection with experiments in crystal
vision, a subject in which Mrs. Holland was specially interested,
and the name had actually occurred, obviously as a reminiscence
of Human Personality, in Mrs. Holland's script of Nov. 7th,
1903 (quoted above, p. 186). In commenting on this script
to Mrs. Holland, however, I had not mentioned Mrs. Verrall
at all ; the latter had only begun to practise automatic writing
after Human Personality was written, and nothing about her
script had yet been published—two brief abstracts only having
appeared in the Journal S.P.E. (printed for private circulation).
There was therefore no ground for a guess on Mrs. Holland's
part that Mrs. Verrall was her fellow-experimenter, whereas a
good many automatic writers—-of whom I might have chosen
one—are mentioned in Human Personality. When I talked
to her about it some time later (May 28/06) she assured
me that she had never imagined Mrs. Verrall did anything
psychic except crystal gazing, and that she had made no
guess as to who her fellow-experimenter was and had not the
slightest idea of it till I told her. Nevertheless, I do not think
it can be stated with absolute confidence that the mention of
" Mrs. V." in her first day's script (see below) was beyond
the possibility of subliminal guessing.
Throughout this series of experiments (and in all future
ones tried between Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall) the writers
held no communication with each other at all, but each
sent her writing to me and communicated only with me
about it.
If any statement was made in one writing purporting to
refer, or that I thought might refer, to the circumstances of
the other writer, I sent a copy of the whole or part of the
script to this latter for her comments. Of course I never
252 Alice Johnson. [part
sent this copy until I had received from the second writer
her own script of the corresponding day.
The identity of each writer was first disclosed to the other
in October, 1905.
In this first series each writer produced six pieces of script.
The following is Mrs. Holland's script on the first day of
the experiments, when she was in Scotland :
(Wednesday, March 1st, 1905. 10.45 a.m.)
There are cut flowers in the blue jar—jonquils I think and tulips
—growing tulips near the window— A dull day but the sky hints
at Spring and one chirping bird is heard above the roar of the
traffic
—
'
Watch ye stand fast in the faith—quit you like men be strong/
The stirring of the Spring begins— Have we not noticed that
more evidence—more testimony comes to us in the Spriug ? Oh
the Spring in our garden—have the bulbs done well this year
—
Does Mrs. V. own herself worsted for once 1 Or does she wait
for a triumph in May— The Banks in May ! Ah me Earth's
glamour holds
—
A slender lady with dark hair drawn to a heavy knot at the
base of her long throat. Eyes like dark jewels in a pale pale
face —the outline of it 'hollowed a little mournfully.' A very
sensitive mouth— Long hands—a signet ring on the middle finger.
Tell Mrs. S. that I am only in accord with her brother through
her— I had thought to be able to reach him in thought by my
own means but he is too absorbed— A. is the one I mean
—
Yes M. R was quite admirable in his address — The work grows
and widens—we cannot be too cosmopolitan
—
Quiet write slowly
I am puzzled how to evade the difficulty about names— They
are very important but to introduce them dislocates the whole
machinery by which I am trying to communicate.
The persons are mentioned in this script only by their
initials, but the intention is obvious. " Mrs. V." is Mrs.
Verrall : "Mrs. S." is Mrs. Sidgwick, and "her brother A.,"
Mr. Arthur Balfour; " M. B." is Brofessor Bichet, in that year
Bresident of the S.B.B., who had delivered his presidential
address on February 6th ; all these were friends of Mr..
Myers, from whom the script purports to come ;
but there is.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter IV. 253
of course, nothing evidential in the mention of any except
Mrs. Verrall.
On a copy of this script being sent to Mrs. Verrall, she
wrote to me :
March 4th, 1905.
On March 1st the only cut flowers in my drawing room were in
two blue china ]'ars on the mantelpiece ; the flowers were large
single daffodils. On the ledge of the [drawing room] window looking
into the greenhouse—on the greenhouse side —were three pots of
growing yellow tulips, —the only flowers near any window.
The day was dull in the morning, but about 12 the sun came
out and it was warm ; it rained heavily in the afternoon. The birds
have naturally been chirping lately. No traffic or roar of any kind in
our road [Selwyn Gardens is not a thoroughfare] ... At 9 a.m.
(about) I cleared away all cut flowers except the daffodils described
;
till then there had been some red tulips.
The text, " Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you
like men," is, as already said, inscribed in Greek over the
front gate of Selwyn College, this being the text of which
the reference only was given in Mrs. Holland's script of
January 17th, 1904, quoted and discussed above, see p. 234,
where its connection with Mr. Myers and Mrs. Verrall is
explained.
That this text should occur again on the first day of
Mrs. Holland's experiments with Mrs. Verrall is to my mind
the most noteworthy point in the script, for, even supposing
that Mrs. Holland had subliminally guessed that Mrs. Verrall
was her fellow-experimenter, this could not account for the
appropriate introduction of the text.
Mrs. Verrall's script of March 1st, 1905, written at 6 p.m.,
contains the following
:
v. iii. black letter text
* * * *
Don't identify it might alarm her.
The last sentence, perhaps, shows a vague general resemblance
to the last paragraph of Mrs. Holland's script. The first has
a possible connection with Mrs. Holland's mention of a text.
On my sending her a copy of it, she suggested that it might
refer to I. Corinthians, part of which she happened to have
251 Alice Johnson. [part
been reading early on Wednesday morning, and she found that
I. Corinthians, v. 3, ran :
" For I verily, as absent in body,
but present in spirit, . . .
." She added :
" I noticed on
Thursday, as I read on, that xvi. 13 had been quoted in the
writing that came to me."
On March 8 th no correspondence appeared between the
two scripts, nor any point worth commenting on in either.
I quote next two scripts by Mrs. Verrall. The second of
these was not written on one of the days fixed for the experi-
ments, but she sent it to me because, as she said, she had an
impression that it " belonged " to my friend (i.e. Mrs. Holland).

On March 22nd I sent copies of both these scripts to
Mrs. Holland, and she received them on March 23rd. Her
script, dated March 22nd (quoted below), contains the initials
" E. G." followed by some notes of music, but—unfortunately
from an evidential point of view—this was not sent to me
until March 24th. In the letter of that date, enclosing it,
Mrs. Holland, who was staying at her father's house in the
South of England, wrote
:
The writing of March 19th has a curious gossamer thread of
connection with me. I was not at church last Sunday evening, and
the Dream of St. Ursula does not hang in my room. But on
Saturday evening I was going through the portfolio of "Great Masters
"
(published by Heinemann) and the Carpaccio Ursula was the picture
I looked at longest and returned to most frequently,—so much so,
indeed, that my father asked me if I would like to have it framed
and hung in my room.
Mrs. Holland's script of March 22 nd was :
(Wednesday, March 22nd. 9.45 p.m.)

In regard to the coincidence of notes of music appearing in
the scripts of both writers, they have appeared only once
before in Mrs. Holland's script (viz. on Jan. 8th, 1904, among
a number of other drawings) and never since. March 15th
and March 19th, 1905, just quoted, were the first occasions
on which they have appeared in Mrs. Verrall's script, and they
have only recurred there once, viz. on September 5th, 1906,
which seems to be a reminiscence of this occasion.
Professor Eichet is again referred to here. His presidential
address, delivered on Feb. 6th, 1905, was on the subject of
" metapsychics," a term which he coined to include all the
topics dealt with in psychical research. Brief reports of his
address, including the new word, had appeared in the papers.
I found on enquiring from Mrs. Holland later (on Oct. 6th,
1905) that she could not remember having seen any of these
reports, or having heard the word " metapsychics " ; but she
may of course have seen and forgotten them. She could not
even remember that she had ever heard of Professor Richet
;
but as he is mentioned several times in Human Personality,
she must have seen the name there.
I sent a copy of this script to Mrs. Verrall and she sent
me the following notes on it
:

Mrs. Holland wrote to me on April 4th, 1905, a propos of this phrase, that
she had a calendar called "Fragments for 1905," and she sent me a list of
the authors quoted in it. Among the names for October occurs that of
F. W. H. Myers.

(1) ivory gate. In March, 1905, I was revising that part of my
paper on my script which deals with "Orphism," etc., and spent a
great deal of time on the two days, March 19 and 20, in looking up
the question of descriptions by Virgil and Dante of the " gate of
hell " ; in the course of so doing I read the passage in the Sixth
Aeneid about the gates of horn and ivory; (note that, if "good"
is equivalent to " true," the script has inverted the idea ; the true
dreams come through the gate of horn). 1
My interest in the "gate
of hell " was concerned with it as a possible passage for returning
spirits, so that the connexion with the gates of horn and ivory is
pretty close ; the occurrence of Italian in connection with this writing
may be interesting, as I was reading Italian for the first time for
months on March 19 or March 20.
(2) F. without the final k. This is characteristic of Mr. Myers's
name, as can be seen in any of his title pages ; he used to say that
to spell it with a k was one of the blunders he should make when
he tried to communicate.
In her letter of March 24th, 1905, enclosing the script of
March 22nd, Mrs. Holland wrote:
I wonder if the jottings I enclose convey any meaning to you. It
is an impression that has come to me very strongly within the last
few days and I have written it down to get rid of it. It was not
automatically written in the least, but I do not know why the
impression has come into my mind.
This was the impression
:
A thin woman, not very young ; at least the further side of thirty.
Her dark hair is slightly rough or naturally fluffy and begins to
show threads of grey over the ears. She often wears a jyvnce nez,
with either no frame or a very slight one. She has lost a great
many people she loved, both relatives and friends, and the trinkets
she habitually wears are more relics than ornaments. A ring, a gold
chain, both very full of memories. Grey eyes ; the black lashes almost
close when she laughs. Grey dresses, green dresses, simply made—
often with wide belts. Not a "tailor made" woman. Critical; a
little too incisive in manner ; with a warm heart and a curiously

The same version as that of the script occurs in Rudyarcl Kipling—a writer
for whom I believe Mrs. Holland has a special admiration. In describing the
Taj Mahal he says :
" It was the Ivory Gate through which all good dreams
come"' (From Sea to Sea, Vol. I., p. 4).

unexpected fund of shyness. Very well educated. Her college
career was attended with a good deal of distinction. She is very
highly strung, but too self-controlled to be called "nervous." The
mouth has mobile lips and she has a trick of contracting the lower
lip of which she is probably unconscious. Reserved to a fault. She
is beginning to attain to a faith she once thought she had outgrown.
This description, which is not unlike the one given on Jan.
5th, 1904 (see above, p. 212), might naturally be taken to
apply to Mrs. Holland's fellow-experimenter, and accordingly
I sent it to Mrs. Verrall for her comments. She wrote on
April 4th, 1905 :
My husband and I think this description fairly good, as far as it
goes, though there are no very distinctive points. The eyes and lashes
are entirely wrong ; but there is no other blatant misdescription.
Of course, like every one of my age, I have lost many relatives and
friends. [The remarks about the trinkets, though not very definite,
are certainly appropriate.] I have only had two dresses this winter
that were not black, one evening dress, grey, and a dull green day dress,
both with wide belts, but who does not wear wide belts ? I have
a trick with my lower lip of which I am aware, as it is due to a
criticism on my mouth made when I was a child. I am apt to
draw it in and let the upper lip project, showing the two front teeth.
I think that Mrs. Verrall's friends would consider the
description of character in many points very apt.
The last passage worth quoting during this series of experi-
ments occurs in Mrs. Verrall's script of April 5th, 1905 :
A gate and beyond a common and a windswept sky hedges on
each side of the gate—alder and guelder rose not quickset
look through the gate to the western sky, and long straight lines
of cloud with clear green blue sky between since the clearing.
That is all I see that peaceful landscape.
Of this description Mrs. Holland wrote to me (April 11th,
1905) : "... the gate in the hedge looking to the western
sky and a peaceful landscape applies to my surroundings last
Wednesday [i.e. April 5th]." She told me later (May 28th,
1906) that the description was applicable to the garden gate
of her father's house, where she was then staying, but that
the particular trees mentioned were not characteristic.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter IV. 259
During the next six weeks, Mrs. Holland was travelling on
the Continent. Meanwhile she attempted every Wednesday to
convey an impression and one definite word, chosen and noted
by herself, to her fellow-experimenter. These impressions re-
lated to the places that she was visiting. She sent me her
notes after returning to England ; but I found that in no case
had Mrs. Verrall's script shown any coincidence with the
topics selected.
After this Mrs. Verrall tried for a few weeks (from May
31st, 1905) to convey ideas chosen by herself to Mrs. Holland ;
but these experiments also were quite unsuccessful.
Fourth Period : May 31st to August 8th, 1905.
Mrs. Holland only produced seven pieces of script during
this period and there is little of interest to note about it.
She had now returned from the Continent but was moving
about a good deal, and it is possible that this produced an
unsettled state of mind which was unfavourable.
As usual, much of the script purports to come from Mr.
Myers, but there is a sudden development of a new control
—
Laurence Oliphant, who predominates during this period. His
first appearance is on May 31st, 1905. After various frag-
mentary and apparently random utterances
:
Laurence foretold it in 1885 a recrudescence of spiritualization

is the title of a book by Laurence Oliphant, published in
1885. In the preface he predicted that a new and more
sympathetic attitude towards psychic matters would obtain
within twenty years. Alice was his first wife.
The next script on the same topic begins with the words
" Vato—peto "
—obviously meant for the title of Oliphant's novel,
Altiora Peto. It refers to the well known incidents of his

life—the Memoir by his cousin " Maggie " (Mrs. Oliphant),
his entanglement with Thomas Lake Harris, and his first and
second wives, Alice and Eosamond. Mrs. Holland wrote to
me later (June 6th, 1907): "If I remember right I read
Mrs. Oliphant's life of her cousin in 1903, and have not
looked at or thought of it again until a few clays ago, when
I consulted it in the library to see if it threw any light on
names and dates given in the script."

January 2nd, 1886, was the date of Alice Oliphant's
death. She died in Palestine, and was buried in the Friedhof
cemetery at Haifa. Laurence Oliphant died at Twickenham,
and is buried in the cemetery there. Mrs. Holland tells me
that the lines about Twickenham in the script are quoted
from a drawing-room song,—no doubt suggested to her sub-
liminal by the association of Oliphant with Twickenham.
" Lowry " was Lady Oliphant's name for her son.
The next script refers chiefly to Alice Oliphant.

After this date, there are no more references in the script
to Laurence Oliphant, in whom, as she afterwards told me,
Mrs. Holland took no interest.
But I will quote an incident in connection with one of
the passages as possibly throwing light on one aspect of the
psychology of automatism. In a letter dated June 22nd,

L.v.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter IV. 263
1905, enclosing the script of June 21st, quoted above, Mrs.
Holland writes :
—
This last writing has a quotation from Rossetti's " Staff and
Scrip," but why should Palestine be underlined? I am familiar
with the lines, " When the Invisible grows to fulfilment," and
"The woman-soul leadeth us upward and on," but I cannot remember
if they have anything to do with each other, or where they come
from.
I have the impression that all the writing this time is meant to
come from one influence, and it is a new one, or nearly so. The
untidy marks at the end mean that I broke off in a fit of shivering,
winch I took to mean that I had written enough. There was
not the slightest approach to a trance condition, it was like a
rather slow dictation. I have a funny confused impression of a
group of three women and one man. One of the women is elderly.
The " message " comes from the man chiefly, but sometimes the
youngest woman of the three joins in, as it were. This sounds
fantastic, but as the writing came before noon on a sunny morning,
I did not dream it. Also if I note it down, I shan't worry about
it, or attach undue importance to it.
This description appears to me to involve a kind of dis-
sociation of consciousness which I suspect frequently occurs
in cases of automatism. To Mrs. Holland's supraliminal
consciousness comes an impression of a group of three women
and one man ; one is an elderly woman, the message comes
chiefly from the man, but sometimes the youngest woman
joins in. " It is a new influence, or nearly so," she remarks.
Meanwhile the writing done by her subliminal consciousness
shows clearly that these persons are Laurence Oliphant, his
mother, and his first and second wives,
1
who have only pur-
ported to control once before, on May 31st. But for the
moment the recognition seems confined to her subliminal self;
supraliminally she only conceives of them as a group of persons
unidentified.
A similar experience is described on July 27th, 1905.
Here she writes automatically the one word " Maud," and
then goes on in her normal hand-writing
:
Automatic script seems unwilling to come and instead I have an
impulse to note a waking dream last night. I was unwell yesterday,

and did nothing but rest and read novels. Before I slept I
remembered I had not tried for script, and then some one seemed
to say :
" You have forgotten again, but you must write to-morrow ;
write to-morrow morning about Leckhampton. Don't forget Leck-
hampton."
I know nothing about the place and I said so mentally, for I was
in a kind of doze, —not actually dreaming, but not fully conscious.
Then I got an impression of a face I am vaguely familiar with,
though I have certainly never seen it in real life. A pale face,
that of a man no longer young ; a high brow, dark hair going
grey, a moustache and small pointed beard I think, but the chin
was drawn in and the chief impression given was that of the high
brow and the dark eyes that were at once penetrating and sad.
No impression of figure or dress, only the face. After a minute or
two it went away and was followed by the face of a younger man
with a strong chin and a long moustache ; but almost before I
could realize this face it went, and an old man with white beard
and glasses showed a fraction of a minute, and then it was all
gone. The first face was the clearest, the last very dim and
quickly gone. I cannot recall any portraits I have seen lately like
these faces, and I am not given to seeing faces in the dark.
I had hoped for some interesting script this morning, but nothing
will come.
These three men are of course Mr. Myers, Mr. Gurney,
and Dr. Sidgwick, and the description of them is almost
identical with that given in the reverse order in the script
of Feb. 21st, 1905 (cpuoted above, p. 246), and followed there
by the three names " Henry, Edmund, Fred." The description
is no doubt based on the portraits in Fragments of Prose and
Poetry (though on each date a mistake is made in describing
Dr. Sidgwick. On Feb. 21st he is said to be "nearly bald,"
and on July 27th to be wearing glasses. Neither of these
statements was true at any time). But Mrs. Holland does
not seem to recognise them supraliminally.
" Leckhampton," the name of Mr. Myers's house at Cambridge,
is also given in Fragments.
Some other cases of visions unrecognised will be given later.
In these cases the script seems to represent a stratum of
consciousness with a more retentive memory and in some
respects a fuller and more complete knowledge than the
lv.J Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 265
normal. This is only what we are accustomed to find. But
we see here also a restriction or inhibition of the normal con-
sciousness, in that it is apparently unable for the moment to
use its ordinary faculties or to draw the most obvious inferences
as to the persons represented in its visual impressions.
This restriction of the normal consciousness, shown here
in a rudimentary and evanescent form, may perhaps be
favourable to the full development of the subliminal activity.
In any case it certainly seems correlated with it.
The same restriction may account in part for the difficulty
that automatists so often find in interpreting passages in
their own script which are perfectly intelligible to another
reader. " My eyes were holden," Mrs. Holland said in one
such case ; and Mrs. Verrall has often found the same, though
her long practice in analysing her script from an outside
point of view has to a great extent overcome the difficulty.
It seems even possible that the sight of the script shortly after
it has been produced may tend sometimes to reproduce in the
writer the dissociation of consciousness which originally accom-
panied it, just as the act of carrying out a post-hypnotic
suggestion sometimes re-induces hypnosis. Of one passage
Mrs. Holland wrote (July 11th, 1907): "On reading over
the script before sending it this passage conveyed nothing to
me. I seem curiously dense concerning the script for two
or three days after writing it."
CHAPTER V.
Fifth Period—Oct. 6th, 1905 to Feb. 18th, 1906.
Up to this time I had given Mrs. Holland no information as
to what statements in her script were possibly or apparently
evidential. From the beginning I had impressed on her the
fact that much of it was derived from her reading of Human
Personality, etc., though, I said, there were certain points that
could not be so explained. I purposely abstained from telling
her which points or which passages interested me ; because
I wished the writing to be as spontaneous as possible and
2(36 Alice Johnson. PART
not to be guided in any way by my comments. In the
case of her experiments with Mrs. Verrall, I merely sent her
copies of some of Mrs. Verrall's script, asking her to tell
me if anything in it related to her ; but in regard to her
own script, I simply told her there were several points in
her first writing that seemed applicable to my friend's sur-
roundings,—without indicating which they were,—and that an
interesting point had occurred on one of the later days.
Of course I explained to Mrs. Holland the reasons for my
reticence, which she perfectly appreciated and readily acquiesced
in. In fact, after my first explanation, she herself often begged
me to go on keeping her in the dark, so that she might as
far as possible avoid being influenced in the writing by her
own speculations as to interesting points. She wrote to me
on June 22nd, 1905: "I very much prefer being 'in the
dark ' for the present. If you were to tell me week by
week that this particular phrase carried a half sense, or that
these initials might have a meaning, my mind would inevitably
try to follow up clues and the outside character of the writing-
would vanish. That part of it is from outside I canuot
help believing."
I saw her for the first time, as I have already said, on
October 6th, 1905, when she was staying in London for a
short time and came to the S.P.E. rooms at 20 Hanover
Scprare and we had a talk of about 2h hours on her script.
The account I now give is taken from my notes of this
interview, written two days later. The first incident is
another illustration of what is referred to at the end of the
last chapter, namely, the failure of her supraliminal to recog-
nise something that is well known to the subliminal con-
sciousness.
I purposely gave her a chair facing Mr. Myers's portrait,
but said nothing about it. I saw that she noticed it almost
at once ; she sat staring at it with so much fixity that I
thought it probable she might go into a trance. She did
not appear to be listening to what I was saying, so I went
on talking about nothing in particular. Presently she said
in an agitated manner :
" Who is that man ? I'm sure I've
seen him before. I know him quite well." When I explained
who it was, she said she thought she must have seen the
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 267
portrait before, though she believed it was not in Human
Personality. I showed her a copy of the same portrait in
Fragments of Prose and Poetry (which she had told me she
had once seen) and she recognised this as the source of her
impression. I told her that many things in her recent script
were obviously derived from this book.
I enlarged on the importance of finding out how much
of her script was due to reminiscences of things heard or
seen casually and perhaps subconsciously, and asked her if
she could think of any kind of link between herself and
Mr. Myers, e.g. Lady Mount-Temple, whom she had mentioned
in a letter to me. She said she had only seen Lady Mount-
Temple once—towards the end of her life—probably in 1900.
She had then left Broadlands (where Mr. Myers knew her)
and Mrs. Holland was sure she had not spoken at all of
Mr. Myers or of any of his associates in psychical research
or of anything to do with the subject. She could not think
of any other mutual acquaintance.
After discussing some other topics in the script, I cross-
examined her about the references in her script of Feb. 15 th
1905, to the opening of Mr. Myers's posthumous envelope,
as described in the section on that incident (see above, p. 241).
We also discussed the mention of Professor Eichet in the
script (see above, pp. 252 and 255).
Mrs. Holland told me that she had never, she believed,
seen a copy of the Proceedings or Journal ; that a little time
back she had seen an advertisement offering a second-hand
set of Proceedings for sale and that she had purposely abstained
from buying it or looking for it anywhere in order to remain
as ignorant as possible of S.P.E. affairs.
She asked me if 5 Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge, was really
Mrs. Verrall's address, as stated in her script (of Nov. 7 th
1903), and if it was given in Human Personality. I told
her it was correct and was not in Human Personality. She
was specially anxious on this point and seemed to remember
the writing clearly and to have thought of it on this occasion
spontaneously. I told her that Mrs. Verrall was the lady
with whom she had been experimenting in the early part
of this year, and she was much interested and seemed to
realise clearly who Mrs. Verrall was, whereas she had given
268 Alice Johnson. [part
no sign of recognition when I spoke of Professor Eichet,
who also is mentioned in Human Personality. Probably she
remembered Mrs. Verrall's name because it was there connected
with the subject of crystal-gazing, in which she was specially
interested on account of her own experiences (see her letter
of Nov. 19th, 1903, quoted above, p. 185).
I then read over to Mrs. Holland her own script of March
1st, 1905, the first day of her experiments with Mrs. Verrall
(quoted above, p. 252), and told her what points in it were
correct. I also told her that Mrs. Verrall's house was near
Mr. Myers's and that the text quoted by her on that day
was over the gateway of Selwyn College, which was near
both houses.
I noted carefully all the information I gave to Mrs. Holland
on this occasion, in case any of it should re-appear later
in her script. As a matter of fact one incident which I
told her, to which she paid little attention at the time and
which she afterwards quite forgot, did lead to two visions,
as will be related below (see p. 286). When she first told
me of these visions, I had no recollection of having mentioned
the circumstances to her and should probably never have
remembered it if I had not found it recorded in my notes.
The result of this interview was to confirm the impression
I had already gained from my correspondence with her,
—
that Mrs. Holland was anxious to give me all and any informa-
tion that could possibly throw light on her script, regardless
of what conclusions it might lead to.
After leaving London, Mrs. Holland wrote to me on Oct.
17th, 1905 :
It was exceedingly natural that after my long talk with you
on Oct. 6th, I should dream of automatic writing ; but as I had
never before clone so, I noticed the dream particularly. In my
dream I was " trying " for writing with a friend, the last person
I should mention such experiments to in real life, and after some
delay a couplet, which I cannot recall, was written. The lines
were, I think, ten-syllabled and the words "stars" and "light"
and " peace " occurred.
Then came "Keswick "
" He asked life of Thee and Thou gavest him a long life, even
for ever and ever ;
"
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 269
and the dream ended with my saying :
" Of course, that's on the
grave."
Can you remember if you told me that this is Mr. Myers's
epitaph? I feel as if I had got it from you, either consciously or
unconsciously.
Mr. Myers was buried in the churchyard of St. John's,
Keswick ; the text mentioned is not on his grave, but on
the memorial tablet to him in the church. I did not know
this at the time and had not mentioned the subject to Mrs.
Holland ; but while talking to me she had had in her hands
for a few minutes his Fragments of Prose and Poetry, as I
was showing her the portraits in it. This text is quoted
at the end of the Autobiography, and it is mentioned at
the beginning that Mr. Myers was born at Keswick, his
father being incumbent of St. John's Church, Keswick. That
he should be buried at Keswick and that this text should
be on his grave might therefore be an inference from state-
ments in the autobiography.
I had now decided to take the first opportunity of introducing
Mrs. Holland to Mrs. Verrall. On September 27th, 1905, I
had seen Mrs. Verrall and told her that I was hoping to meet
Mrs. Holland before long and wished her to meet her some
time also. Mrs. Verrall suggested asking her to her house
at Cambridge during the Christmas holidays. My next talk
with Mrs. Verrall on the subject was on Oct. 10th, four days
after my interview with Mrs. Holland, described above. I
gave Mrs. Verrall a general account of this interview and then
told her for the first time of the statement in Mrs. Holland's
script of Jan. 17th, 1904: "The sealed envelope is not to be
opened yet," and asked her to look up her own script of that
time to see if there was any sort of coincidence with this in
it. Further enquiry led to the discovery of what is described
above (Chapter III.) as the first cross-correspondence between
Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall. I now first looked up the
reference 1 Cor. 16. 13. in Mrs. Holland's script of Jan. 17th,
1904, and found that it was that of the text given in her script
of March 1st, 1905, viz. the text inscribed on Selwyn College;
and it was now that I first heard of Mrs. Verrall's attempt
to get in her script the text asked for by Mrs. Siclgwick. The
discovery of this " cross-correspondence " of course confirmed my
270 Alice Johnson. [part
view that it was desirable to have more experiments between
Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall.
A Premonition ?
After seeing me on the afternoon of October 10th, Mrs.
Verrall returned to Cambridge. While in the train on her
way to Cambridge she wrote some script in which—apparently
a propos of nothing—occurred the words :
" Arrange the date.
November 16th not the later day." She attached no meaning
to this. On October 19th, 20th, and 23rd, she was corre-
sponding with a lady in London, who wished to see her on
psychical matters. On October 27th, being in London, she
tried to make an appointment with her dentist for Nov. 7 th
or 8 th, those being the days on which the lady in London
could also see her. The dentist's earliest possible day was
November 16th, and she accordingly arranged an appointment
then, though much annoyed at not being able to fit it in
with her visit to the lady. 1
Next day (Oct. 28 th) I received a letter from Mrs.
Holland, dated Oct. 27th, 1905, in answer to one of mine
saying that Mrs. Verrall wished to invite her to Cambridge at
Christmas time. In this letter, Mrs. Holland expressed her
regret at not being able to go to Cambridge, and added :
" I
wonder is she [Mrs. Verrall] likely to be in town next month.
I hope to be there for a week from Nov. 15 th."
I, knowing nothing of Mrs. Verrall's arrangements, sent her
this letter and asked her if she could manage to come up to
London during the week mentioned. She replied proposing
November 16th (the day previously fixed with her dentist),
and so it came about that she and Mrs. Holland first met on
Nov. 16th, not at Christmas time, which corresponds to the
direction of the script, "Arrange the date. November 16th
not the later day."
Second Interview, Nov. 16th, 1905.
Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall met for the first time on
Nov. 16th, 1905, in my presence, this being also the first
time that any direct communication had passed between them.
1
All these dates were furnished to me later from Mrs. Verrall's diary.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 'Ill
I wrote an account of the interview the next morning, noting
whatever facts mentioned in the conversation were probably
unknown to Mrs. Holland before, in case references to them
should turn up later in her script. These will be mentioned
below where necessary.
In discussing some of Mrs. Holland's previous script, the
following points were mentioned
:
(1) That there was a quotation—I did not say what—from
Mr. Myers's poem St. Paul in her script.
(2) That the writings of her Myers and Gurney controls
bore no resemblance to the real handwritings of Mr. Myers
and Mr. Gurney.
(3) Mrs. Verrall remarked that the rather brusque and
peremptory tone of Mrs. Holland's Gurney control was very
much like the style of " Mrs. Forbes's " " E.G.," and some
stress was laid on this. In speaking of " Mrs. Forbes," Mrs.
Verrall used her real name. It is, I think, rather remarkable
that this name has never appeared in Mrs. Holland's subsequent
script.
(4) I read to Mrs. Verrall the description of a man in
the script of Nov. 7th, 1903, and she gave her opinion as
to what points in it correctly applied to Dr. Verrall.
(5) We told Mrs. Holland about the premonition in Mrs.
Verrall's script that the text asked for by Mrs. Sidgwick was
to be given on Jan. 17th, 1904, which seemed to have a
sort of fulfilment in her own script of that date ; that she
did not give the right text, but a reference to one that had
a distinct association with Mr. Myers and Mrs. Verrall and
was given in full by her on March 1st, 1905.
(6) I told Mrs. Holland of Mrs. Verrall's " premonition " of
their meeting on this date.
(7) Mrs. Verrall said that the text Mrs. Holland had
dreamt of (see above) was on Mr. Myers's grave. (This was
not quite correct. As stated above, the text is on the
memorial tablet in the church, not on the grave.)
(8) A propos of two Christian names, hitherto unidentified,
in Mrs. Holland's script, Mrs. Verrall said she thought they
must be Mr. and Mrs. " N." Mrs. Holland said she knew
nothing about Mr. and Mrs. N. This was not literally correct.
She knew neither of them personally (which was probably
272 Alice Johnson. [part
what she meant), but Mrs. N., who had died twenty years
before, soon after her marriage—in 1886 —had been well
known to a cousin of hers, who had frequently mentioned her
in her letters of that date to Mrs. Holland in India. A piece
of script giving some details about Mrs. N.'s will was later
traced by Mrs. Holland to a passage in one of these early
letters. All this information, of course, I owe to her. This
is one of the most marked instances in her history of the
re-emergence of a long-forgotten idea and will be related
below (see p. 287). Here I will only draw attention to the
fact that it was through Mrs. Holland's own care that the
unevidential character of the incident, which at first sight
appeared very impressive, was discovered.
On this occasion Mrs. Holland gave me further information
as to her family history and connections.
" Spectator " Eeview of Maxwell's " Metapsychical
Phenomena."
In a letter dated Oct. 27th, 1905, Mrs. Holland told me
that she had read a review in the Spectator of Oct. 7th of
Dr. Maxwell's book, Metapsychical Phenomena, prefaced by Pro-
fessor Eichet and Sir Oliver Lodge. The review, I found, was a
long one, going into many details of the phenomena, which it
criticised very sevei'ely ; and it is clearly responsible for much
of the matter of the script produced during this period. The
script is by no means a mere reproduction of the review ; it
takes rather the attitude of one who has read it and has
formed an independent view of the facts, showing indeed in one
or two instances what looks like an independent knowledge
of them. Great anxiety is shown by both the Myers and
Gurney controls—expressed, as usual, more emphatically by
the latter—lest the S.P.R should be carried away by the
marvellous reports and lest " the ruin of all we have been
working for so long should ensue." The warning is reiterated
again and again.
My readers may remember that, besides the appearance of
Dr. Maxwell's book, the most salient " occult " events of this
period were the Greek script of " Mme. X.," later described
and discussed at great length in Proceedings, Part LI. (Dec.
lv.] Atitomatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 273
1905), and the famous Algerian "materialisations." In regard
to these matters, the attitude of the " controls " has an
undoubted resemblance to that of some members of the S.P.K.,
—myself among others. Whether it really represents in any
way an actual view taken by Mr. Myers and Mr. G-urney is
of course an open question. But it has to be remembered
that these controls, or at least the Myers control, have in
the course of the script produced evidential matter pointing
towards personal identity ; and it has frequently been argued
—I think with a certain show of reason—chat any evidential
matter produced by a control tends to support its general
claim to genuineness. I offer this case, then, for the considera-
tion of persons who are accustomed to maintain this argument.
For my own part, I cannot admit its validity. I think
that each part of the script must be judged primarily on
the sole ground of its own evidential character. Mr. Myers
may have taken the view here attributed to him, but there is
no real evidence that he did, and even if there were such
evidence, no one would be bound to agree with him.
The review of Dr. Maxwell's book, which, as I have said,
is the undoubted source of much of this script, appeared on
Oct. 7th, 1905. Nevertheless it was not until Nov. 19th
that the script touched in any way on the topic of phenomena
analogous to those treated of in the book.
About this time Mr. Feilding was making arrangements
to attend some sittings with Eusapia Paladino in Paris, and
on Nov. 19th he came to discuss the matter with me and
to look at some of my records of the sittings at Cambridge,
which have never been published in full. He was with me
from about 3.30 to 6.30 p.m., but I had also spent most of
the morning in looking out the records for him and consequently
had had the subject much in my mind for most of the day.
Mrs. Holland's script of Nov. 19th, 1905, was written at
1 1 a.m. as follows :

I am inclined to think that these descriptions of fraudulent

tion of my conversation with Mr. Feilding on that day. But the

whole topic of physical phenomena was very much in the air at
that time. On October 27th, 1905, at a Private Meeting
of the S.P.E., Sir Oliver Lodge had described a visit of his
to Dr. Maxwell at Bordeaux for the purpose of attending
sittings. At these sittings raps had been obtained, generally
with contact, and on one occasion a slight movement of a
table without apparent contact. Sometimes small lights were
seen moving about near the medium. Also the medium
himself exhibited luminosity, both on his skin and on his
clothes, after exposure to light, the effect being like that
produced by calcic sulphide. Precautions were taken by the
investigators to prevent the artificial use of calcic sulphide
by the medium and Sir Oliver Lodge suggested that the
luminosity might be a natural physiological or pathological
phenomenon.
The phrase in the script " The luminous paste is an
invention of his own " is perhaps intended to apply to this
phenomenon. The S.P.B. meeting was a private one and
consequently no press reporters were present, and it was
first reported in the Journal for December. Sir Oliver
Lodge, however, had addressed two public meetings on
psychical research during November, one at Oxford on Nov.
13th, where he gave a general discussion of its bearing on
science and religion, and one at Birmingham on Nov. 17th,
when he referred especially to the Greek script of " Mine.
X.," each being reported in the papers of the following day.
At my third interview with Mrs. Holland, on Nov. 21st,
1905, when she brought me the script of Nov. 19th and
20th, I questioned her in detail as to what papers she had
been seeing and whether she had read anything about Sir
Oliver Lodge's addresses in them. She o-ave me full
particulars in answer to my questions and assured me she
had seen nothing in any papers about any S.P.E. topics
since the Spectator review of Maxwell's book. She told me
she was greatly interested in Sir Oliver Lodge and would
certainly have noticed anything she had seen about him. Of
course I told her nothing about my own views of the recent
physical phenomena.
The odd attempt to get the name of Eusapia Paladino (who
is mentioned in the Spectator review) —" Palladia—Euphronia
276 Alice Johnson. [part
—Eustonia—Pallonia "
—is very characteristic. " Palladia " is
probably a reminiscence from Hitman Personality,—-that being
the name of a young Russian girl, whose apparition was seen
repeatedly after her death, as related in a case given in that
book (Vol. II, p. 21).
I told Mrs Holland on Nov. 21st that her writing of
Nov. 19th and 20th seemed to have some connection with a
conversation 1 had had on Nov. 19th with a friend of
mine (whose name I did not mention) who was shortly to
take part in experiments with Eusapia Paladino, and the
script in the early part of December is full of descriptions
of imaginary sittings of a generic type, interpolated with
warnings.
Mrs. Holland had now returned to her father's house
in the country, from which, on Dec. 15th, she sent me
pieces of script, dated Dec. 1st to 7th, extracts from which
I next quote
:

The statement dated Dec. 7th about "Oliver" (obviously
meaning Sir Oliver Lodge), was unfortunately verified. On
Monday, Dec. 11th, he was to have read a paper at the
S.P.R. On Dec. 8th he wrote to me about his engagements,
saying "... a furious cold has seized me and I am good
for nothing. The only thing to do is to get out of every-
thing possible and to go straight home. I earnestly trust
I shall be well enough to come up again on Monday." He
goes on to ask what I can arrange for the meeting if he
is not able to come. He was not, after all, able to come
and his paper was read instead. This was the beginning of
a serious attack of influenza, as the result of which he was
ordered abroad for the winter. In a letter dated Dec. 19th
he told me that it was on the evening of Dec. 7 th that
his cold developed,—that is, the date of Mrs. Holland's script.
As he had to give up several engagements, his indisposition
was mentioned in the papers by the 11th. It was therefore
unfortunate that the script was not sent to me until Dec. loth.
In the letter enclosing it, Mrs. Holland wrote :
" I am sorry
not to have sent you these writings sooner, but my Mother
has been very unwell . . . and one of the servants ill for
days, so I have been domestically busy."
In replying, I told her of the coincidence with Sir Oliver
Lodge's indisposition and asked her in future to send me
each piece of writing, if possible, immediately after it was
produced.
She replied on Dec. 19th:
... I verily believe there is a personal devil, or at least a
personal imp, who takes pains to prevent things being evidence.
Take this last example, for instance. You and I know that
the message about "Poor Oliver" was written on Dec. 7th; hut

seen no reference to Sir Oliver Lodge's indisposition ; I hope it
was quite trifling. . . .

It was obvious to me that this script referred to an intimate
friend of Mr. Myers's,—a well-known literary man, whom I
will call " Mr. Grove,"—though the rather paternal tone adopted
was, as I knew, not appropriate to their relationship. No
name was mentioned, but the place " Clapham " sufficiently
identified him. I therefore sent a copy of the script to Mr.
Grove, on the chance of its havino- some relevance for him.

in no such anxiety as the script suggested about his own
health, but had for some time been anxious about his wife in
that particular respect.
On April 10th, 1906, I saw Mr. Grove and had some talk
with him about Mrs. Holland's script. He told me in regard
to his wife's health, that cancer had been feared, but the
doctors were now satisfied that the fear was unfounded. On
May 15th, 1906, an operation was performed and the doctors'
opinion was justified.
All this had been kept extremely private and was known
to very few persons. I knew nothing of it until I had
communicated with Mr. Grove about the script.
The script, however, certainly seems to refer to an anxiety
of Mr. Grove's on his own behalf, not his wife's, though most
of it would be also appropriate if applied to his anxiety about
her. But this of course detracts from its evidential value
;
so much so that both Mr. and Mrs. Grove, who are certainly
not prejudiced against the belief in spiritistic communications,
refused to attach importance to it.
It may, however, be worth mentioning that very soon after
my talk with Mr. Grove, Mrs. Holland met him at a house
where she was staying from April 12th to 19th. She after-
wards told me (on May 28th, 1906), that on this occasion
she had had a strong impression, which she did not mention
to him, that he was in some special anxiety about a very
near relative, perhaps his wife or a daughter. I never told
her, and I feel sure that she never knew, what the real
facts had been until she saw them in the proofs of this
paper.
Mr. Grove's chief anxiety, as he tells me, had been during
January, February, and March. He thinks it was in March
that they consulted two doctors, who told them that the case
was not malignant, but that a small operation would be
necessary. At the time he met Mrs. Holland, therefore,
his anxiety was no longer acute. For various reasons the
operation was not performed until May 15th, 1906 ;
it was
somewhat more severe than had been anticipated, but all went
well.
After learning that the script of January 9th, 1906, was
to a certain extent veridical, I was reminded of an earlier
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 281
passage which was possibly intended to refer to the same subject,
as follows
:
(June 14th, 1905) . . . [G.] She is wakeful and weary—her hair
hangs loose—dark hair that waves a little — A blue dressing gown
and such a pale tired face— No
—
no not what she fears—not
malignant.— Diet not the knife—a vegetable diet almost entirely
—
stimulants to be dropped by degrees
—
* * * * * *
Mr. Grove tells me in relation to this script that the cause
of their anxiety " had been going on after a fashion for some
years." They were by no means convinced that the case was
malignant, " but (he writes) naturally anything that may
possibly have that character gives some anxiety." The general
description was not inappropriate to Mrs. Grove's condition at
that time ; she had for some years been overdone. " Diet,
largely vegetable and without stimulants, was recommended
and practised at one time,—quite possibly about that time."
Mrs. Grove had a dark blue dressing-gown.
Anniversaries and the " Scribe " Incident.
The next two scripts to be quoted illustrate again the
persistence of recollection of the anniversaries of Mr. Myers's
death (Jan. 17th, 1901), and birth (Feb. 6th, 1843). In
the first is repeated almost verbatim a sentence from the
script of Dec. 1st, 1903: "It will soon be three years now
and yet I seem no further from earth, though perhaps no
nearer, than I was that January day."
This script also repeats for the last time its warnings against
too great credulity. I take the words, " Silver Wedding " to
refer to the S.P.R., but if so, there is an error of recollection
on the part of the controls, for the Society was founded
in 1882.

On Feb. 5th, 1906, Mrs. Holland wrote telling me various
details about what she was doing to explain why she had
not sent me any script for some time, and added
:
For the last week I have had a strong impression that I must
write automatically on Feb. 6th—to-morrow. This impression has
come like an order, chiefly at sleeping and waking, and is vaguely
associated in my mind with the date 1837. When I once begin,
I will try to go steadily on again.
I enclose a cutting from a stray number of the Tribune, the only
mention I have seen of Dr. Hodgson's death. I hope it is true
about the message having come.
The cutting from the Tribune sent to me by Mrs. Holland
is dated Jan. 22nd, 1906, and headed "Alleged messages from
Dr. Hodgson." It gives one of the numerous reports which were
current in America shortly after Dr. Hodgson's death as to
an alleged " message " from him to Professor Hyslop having
been communicated through a medium, in this case stated
to be " a Detroit citizen." The paragraph is in the form of
a telegram from New York, dated Jan. 21st, and states that
Dr. Hodgson " died at Boston a month ago," no details of
the death being given. Not long after this, as we shall see,
he begins to appear as a " control " in the script.

The date 1837 mentioned by Mrs. Holland in connection
with Feb. 6th puzzled me. It recurred in the script of
Feb. 6th, 1907, and I afterwards learnt from Mrs. Holland
that she always associated Feb. 6th with Henry Irving and
thought he was born on Feb. 6th, 1837. (He was really
born on Feb. 6th, 1838.) In the script to be next quoted,
however, the association of Jan. 17th with Feb. 6th makes
it clear that the reference is to Mr. Myers.

when she met Mrs. Holland on November 16th, 1905 (see above,
p. 270), that she had just been to a doctor who had ordered her
to rest entirely from the physical act of writing for three
months. The time, therefore, was now nearly up. As a matter
of fact, after a break of nearly three months, Mrs. Verrall
resumed automatic writing on Feb. 9th, 1906, when a series of
cross-correspondences with Mrs. Holland was started (see below,
p. 310).
On Feb. 9th, 1906, I read Mrs. Holland's script of Feb. 6th
to Mr. Piddington and he at once remarked on the peculiar
284 Alice Johnson. [part
use of the word " Scribe " as equivalent to " medium," which
I had not particularly noticed. It is to be observed also
that the word is repeated, as if to draw our attention to it.
Mr. Piddington told me that when he was staying with Mrs.
Verrall in January, to discuss with her the Report on her
script which she was then preparing for publication, he had
suggested to her the use of the word " scribe " in the sense
of the writing personality. She accepted the suggestion and
the word was used in her Report in Proceedings (published
in October, 1906). At this time it was new to all of us;
the suggestion was a quite original one of Mr. Piddington's
and he had not mentioned it to me. Apparently the only
people who could have had it in mind were he and Dr. and
Mrs. Verrall.
Mr. Piddington's own statement is
:
Feb. 10, 1906.
Yesterday afternoon Miss Johnson read to me the last piece of
script received from Mrs. [Holland]. In it the word " scribe " is
twice used to mean a writer of automatic script. The first time
there follows immediately a reference to Mrs. Verrall. The second
time "scribe" is said to be a better word than "medium" to
describe an automatic writer.
In the latter part of January I was staying with Mrs. Verrall
at Cambridge for the purpose of reading through the second part
of her paper on her own phenomena. I suggested that, instead of
using the phrase "my hand," and other phrases of the kind used
by Mrs. Verrall to differentiate her automatic from her voluntary
self, the expression "The Scribe" should be used to describe "Mrs.
Verrall II." She accepted my suggestion, which was likewise approved
by Dr. Verrall, with whom we discussed it. I had not at the time,
nor have I since, ever seen the word Scribe used in such a sense.
I record my recollections of this incident before having heard
whether Mrs. Verrall remembers it ;
although I have not the least
doubt but that she will perfectly recollect it, and I think Dr. Verrall
will also. . . .
J. G. Piddington.
I had already sent Mrs. Verrall a copy of the script and
she had returned it to me with comments on several points,
but not on the word " Scribe." I wrote again to ask if she
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 285
could confirm Mr. Piddington's recollection of his talk with
her on this word, and she replied :
Feb. 14, 1906.
Mr. Piddington stayed here Jan. 11th to Jan. 15th, and it was
probably Jan. 12th or 13th that he suggested the use of the word
scribe to represent "the producer of the script" as distinguished on
the one hand from my normal self, on the other from supposed
communicators. The word scribe is thus, you will see, not precisely
equivalent to medium in the ordinary sense, but it is appropriate
as used by [Mrs. Holland].
I read that sentence of hers through several times, as I was sure
that something of value was contained in it, but I could not see
what to make of it. The form of the sentence, "this scribe can
be imposed upon by a trick message," suggested that an actual
message, not trick, was in process of statement, but I could not
see the message. All is explained by the use of the word scribe,
which makes an excellent test word. . . .
My husband corroborates the above statements as to the use of
the word scribe, and the date of Mr. Piddington's visit is fixed by my
diary. I have not mentioned the suggested use of scribe in this
sense to any one, till yesterday, dictating to my secretary, I came
across a place in my paper where its use was possible ; but I rejected
the idea in that case.
Margaret de G. Verrall.
Mrs. Verrall's remark that she was unable to recognise the
significance of the sentence about the " Scribe," although sure
that there was something in it, is interesting as another instance
of the automatist's want of recognition of points, though in this
case the want of recognition extends to the performance of
another automatist.
It must be added that Mr. Piddington some time later came
across an obscure and anonymous American book, entitled
Letters from a Spirit (published by the Abbey Press, New
York, May, 1903), a transcript from automatic writing, in the
preface to which the automatist speaks of himself as " The
Scribe." Ic seems very unlikely that Mrs. Holland should
ever have seen this book ; but even if she had, there remains
the coincidence that the word " scribe " is twice used as
equivalent to automatist in her script very shortly after Mr.
Piddington had suggested it to Mrs. Verrall.
286 Alice Johnson. [PAKT
Subliminal Reminiscences.
Two incidents occurring at about this period illustrate in a
striking manner the possibility of recrudescence of memories
that have completely lapsed from the normal consciousness,
and show at the same time the practical difficulty of proving
a person's ignorance of almost any event in the past, and the
consequent necessity for caution in attributing knowledge of
any such event to a supernormal cause.
In the first case, Mrs. Holland had heard of the incident
only a few months before it was represented to her through a
hallucination ; but she had paid so little attention to the
recital that apparently she forgot it immediately afterwards.
In the second case she had been deeply interested at the time
in what she heard ; but the event had entirely faded from
her memory before she reproduced it—twenty years later—in
her script.
(1) An, Apparition.
In a letter dated December 19th, 1905, Mrs. Holland
describes an apparition recently seen by her as follows
:
On Wednesday evening [Dec. 13th], at 9.30 (my father was out
and I had just put my mother to bed), when I came briskly into
a small and very brightly lighted room, I saw the figure of a very
tall, thin man, dressed in grey, standing with his back to the fire.
He had a long face, I think a moustache—certainly no beard—and
suggested young middle age ; but at my second step forward he
was gone. I had been thinking only of a business letter I was
about to answer, and cannot explain the tall grey figure at all. I
have seen nothing of the kind since 1901. I have gone into that
little white sitting-room many times since, at all kinds of hours,
often hoping to see the grey figure again, but I have not been
fortunate.
The description suggested Mr. Gurney to me, but I made
no comment on it to Mrs. Holland. On March 11th, 1906,
she wrote
:
Do you remember the tall man in grey I saw here one evening
in the winter? The other morning I went into a small room next
my own, thinking only of putting away an evening dress. The tall
figure in grey was lying on the bed in a very Aung-down, slack-
jointed attitude. The face was turned from me, the right arm
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 287
hanging back across the body, which lay on the left side. I started
violently, and my foot seemed to strike a small empty bottle on
the floor.
The figure was gone in an instant, as before, and though I looked
carefully I could find nothing on the floor to even suggest the
bottle I had kicked.
I know this house has no story even remotely connected with a
suicide or an over-dose of any drug, so I don't understand it at all.
1 had not been stooping or tiring my eyes in any way.
On March 29th, Mrs. Holland wrote to me that the date
when she saw the second apparition was either Feburary 27th
or 28th.
Mr. Gurney died from an accidental over-dose of chloro-
form, probably taken for neuralgia or insomnia, on June
22nd, 1888. I was at first much puzzled to account for the
details of the second apparition, since the manner of his
death is not, of course, mentioned either in Human Personality
or in the obituary notice of him in Mr. Myers's Fragments
of Prose and Poetry. Later, however, I found from my notes
of my first interview with Mrs. Holland on October 6th,
1905, that I had myself told her the main facts. On May
2 8th, 1906, I saw her again and reminded her of this. She
said she had entirely forgotten it (as I had) and was doubtful
if she could remember it even when reminded of it ; and that
she took very little interest in Mr. Gurney, being mainly
interested in Mr. Myers.
(2) "Annette."
The following is another instance of the re- emergence of
a forgotten piece of knowledge, the source of which might
easily have escaped detection. In this case I substitute
fictitious initials or names for the real names of the persons
concerned. I referred above to Mrs. Verrall's identification of
two Christian names, "Annette" and "George," that had recurred
several times in Mrs. Holland's script (unrecognised by herself),
as those of Mr. and Mrs. " N." Mrs. 1ST. was married in 1885,
and died in 1S86, when her child, a boy, was born; the child
died soon after.
In Mrs. Holland's script of January, 1904, and February
to August, 1905, are eleven references to "Annette," speaking
288 Alice Johnson. [part
of "George," her house, and the date (of her death), 1886,
her child (always, however, referred to . in the script as a
girl), her sisters, etc.
On March 19th, 1906, Mrs. Holland wrote to me:
While I was "scribing" the other day, I jotted down a message
on a separate piece of paper and presently sent it to the lady for
whom I thought it came. She finds it significant and now I want
her to see the various messages in the script I sent from India
purporting to come from [Annette] .... The message that came
the other day was not signed but [Mrs. 0.] has . . . definite
reasons for connecting it with a friend called [Annette] ....
I sent Mrs. 0. a copy of extracts from the script about
Annette and in reply she gave me the following information
in a letter dated April 2nd, 1906.
The script that Mrs. Holland sent her was :
Tell Mary to rest and let pain and anxieties flow over her and
pass away. She must not brace her nerves to resist—but relax
and float — Tell her this comes from the friend who loved cradles
and cradled things twenty years ago.
Mrs. 0. told me that she had known Mrs. N". intimately,,
especially during her brief married life, and added :
She used to talk of the comfort and joy of birds in their nests
and of protected snug children and all cradled things, and in her
will she left me the Chippendale cradle that she bought for her
baby son. About nine years ago a message came to me (from what
source I do not now recollect) which said: "Tell her that she has
the cradle and I have the child." This message came to me a few
months after I had lost my own boy, aged 3£ years, of scarlet
fever —in the winter of 1892-3. It might refer to my child or more
probably to her own son.
[Mrs. 0. went on to quote from a letter of Mrs. Holland's to her,
written after she had been told of the significance of the cradle
message :]
"I am deeply interested in what you tell me, not only because it
explains that particular 'message,' but because I think it may be a
clue to others that came long ago. The first time I ever stayed at.
[Mrs. O.'s father's house] was in the autumn of 1895, and I
well remember that I could not get to sleep one night and my
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 289
hand scrawled again and again '
[Annette]—let [Annette] speak to
Mary' ..."
[Mrs. 0. adds :] Mrs. [Holland] has never been in my house in
London, nor have I ever spoken to her myself about [Annette]
and . . . she was in India during the time of [Annette's] engagement
and brief married life and death I have always known [Mrs.
Holland] very slightly, as her cousins, the were intimate
friends of our youth, but I have not really had opportunity for
conversation until we met in my sister's house a few weeks ago.
As to the dates referred to, Mrs. Holland states that she
was in India without coming home from 1883 to 1890. The
messages from "Annette" to "Mary" came in 1895, "when
(she writes) I always destroyed the script." She had already
told Mrs. 0. that she remembered " in long ago letters from
my cousin [mentioned by Mrs. 0. above] adoring references
to [Annette N.] " and I now asked her to try to find out
whether this cousin could have told her the details about
the cradle. On April 11th, 1906, she wrote to me:
... I had hoped the " cradle message " was a fact unknown to
me, but it proves to be only the subliminal memory. I have
found some of my cousin's letters to me in our girl days, which I
thought I had left in India; those written in 1886 are rather in
fragments. I must have lost or destroyed some pages, but an
undated sheet tells of the sad circumstances of Mrs. [N.'s] death, a
later letter tells of her having left a will, and a third gives some
extracts from it and goes on to say :
" She left her baby's cradle
to Mary [0.], for many reasons, the last of which was '
because I
love all cradles and cradled things' " Strange that the very words
should float up in my mind and yet the context be forgotten. I
can trace back now what called them to the surface. When I was
last in London I lunched with my cousin, and admired a turcpioise
pin on her toilet table. "It belonged to [Annette N.] ; she left it to
mother, and mother lent it to me lately."
So the connection is clear, and its coincidence with the other
cradle message [i.e. the other one mentioned by Mrs. 0.] is only a
pretty chance. I am certain I never heard of that other message
until afterwards. . . .

CHAPTER VI.
Sixth Period—February 21st to April 11th, 1906.
Second Series of Experiments with Mrs. Verrall.
My next (fourth) interview with Mrs. Holland was not, as
suggested by the script of Feb. 6th, on Monday, Feb. 19th,
but on Wednesday, Feb. 21st, 1906. Mrs. Verrall was also
present and later Mr. Piddington came in. We told Mrs.
Holland of the " Scribe incident " just related ; it was also
mentioned that Sir Oliver Lodge was still abroad—near Spezia
—recruiting after his illness in December ; and Mrs. Verrall
talked a little about the report on her script which she was
then writing.
On this occasion both Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall tried
to write automatically, sitting in the same room at a little
distance from one another. There was no coincidence between
the two writings.
Afterwards Mrs. Holland tried crystal-gazing ; but most of
her visions were obviously suggested by the circumstances
of the moment, viz.
:
(1) a scene in the Lake Country, after talking of Keswick ;
(2) two faces, a man with dark eyes and grey beard and
a shorter man looking over his shoulder, with florid
complexion and heavy eye-brows ;
(3) a street in some large Italian town (probably Rome).
With Mr. Piddington holding the crystal
:
(4) details in a suburban scene. (Mr. Piddington was then,
as she knew, staying at Surbiton.)
(5) An old-fashioned round table, with claw legs; two or
three books, one open, and old-fashioned maps on it.
" Nothing remains but a big map, the States of
America—not clear—a dull map."
This last vision was the only apparently veridical one of
the series. Mr. Piddington told me later in the day that he
had just before been studying a map of the United States,
in view of his going to Boston in April to settle the affairs
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI 291
of the American Branch. Mrs. Verrall and I knew of his
intended journey ; but Mrs. Holland did not.
As to the two faces (No. 2) no remark was made to Mrs.
Holland, but I supposed at the time that the first was Mr.
Myers, with whose portrait she was now familiar, and the
second Dr. Hodgson, of whose personal appearance I believe
she knew nothing, but who is described similarly, though more
in detail, in her script of Feb. 28th, 1906, quoted below.
During this visit to London, Mrs. Holland also met Mr.
Feilding, whose name shortly afterwards begins to appear in
her script.
She returned on February 26th, 1906, to her father's house
in the country, and on February 28th the second series of her
experiments with Mrs. Verrall began ; —both writers as before
sending their scripts to me, without any communication with
each other.
It will be seen that this series begins with a greatly
increased knowledge on Mrs. Holland's part of the personnel
of the S.P.E. On the first day she wrote as follows
:
(Wed., Feb. 28th, 1906. 2 p.m.)

This script requires somewhat lengthy comments
:
(a) " Everard " is Mr. Feilding, whom Mrs. Holland had
met at a dinner-party in London shortly before. He went
to the Malay Peninsula in September of this year. He had
not mentioned his intended journey to Mrs. Holland and she
believes that no one else had spoken of it in her hearing
;
but this is not absolutely certain. She remembered that she
had heard the name " Everard " in connection with him, but
thought it was one of his brothers.
(b) refers to Sir Oliver Lodge, whose illness we had talked
of on Feb. 21st.
(c) ,
(d) and probably (e) refer to Mrs. Verrall's report on
her script, then being prepared by her, and mentioned to
Mrs. Holland on Feb. 21st.
( f) " Dickon of Norfolk " is obviously intended as a sort
of pun on the name Eichard Hodgson. For further comments
on this, see the section on the Hodgson control, p. 305.
(g) Keswick, somewhat as seen by Mrs. Holland in one of
her crystal visions on Feb. 21st.
(h) Another reference to Lady Mount-Temple's house, where
Mr. Myers and Mr. Gurney first met Mr. Stainton Moses.
So far the script seems mainly depeudent on reminiscences.
For the evidential points I cpuote notes made by Mrs. Verrall

numbers in round brackets corresponding to similar reference-

great trouble ever since. No special trouble from sparrows. Hedge
of fir-trees pruned on Feb. 26th or 28th ;
creepers on house cut back
between Feb. 22nd and 28th, —later than usual, since my gardener
was ill. This question was troubling me for about a week before I
went to town on Feb. 21st. He came back to work on Feb. 21st,
as I found on my return. Pear-trees are the only fruit-tree we
have, but the pruning has long been done.
(2) "A's sister" [i.e. Dr. Verrall's sister, Miss Verrall] has had no
trouble. On Feb. 27th or 28th he had a letter asking him to write
to her on business, which he did on Feb. 28th or March 1st.
(3) No Rhine wine.
(4) "Henry was not mistaken" and (5) "No, not in the

(Script ceased at 11.10—leaving me feeling annoyed.)
Much of this script again is either non-evidential or refers
to subjects within Mrs. Holland's normal knowledge.
(a) From " Not May . . . accent conceal it " is, I think,
a fancy picture of Mr. Feikling's intended journey to the
East, referred to in the script of Feb. 28th. "Mariposa"
was the name of the ship in which R, L. Stevenson and his
wife sailed from Samoa to Sydney in 1893 (see Vailima Letters,
p. 247). Probably it crops up here by association of ideas
with eastern travelling.
(b) " Couldn't undertake the book . . . fused
a little " probably refers again to Mrs. Verrall's report on
her script.
296 Alice Johnson. [part
I sent Mrs. Verrall extracts from the passages following
this, on which she sent me the following notes
:
March Wth, 1906.
(1) This sentence suggests a reminiscence of the excessive trouble
which the accents gave me in the X. script [i.e. Mrs. Verrall's
article on the Greek script of "Madame X." published in the Pro-
ceedings, Part LI., Dec. 1905, of which I believe Mrs. Holland knew
nothing].
(2) and (4) On Wednesday, March 7th, I went to the Botanical
Gardens to see the bulbs, because on Wednesday morning my own
garden was full of bees (the first noticed this year) and I knew
that bees meant open bulbs. But they had dug up the bulb beds
and are apparently altering the arrangement. The quince-tree is
unidentified.
(3) These words are perfectly intelligible and very interesting.
[They constitute another cross-correspondence, to which a separate
section is devoted below, p. 297.]
(5) I saw the first butterfly (peacock) on Tuesday or Wednesday.
(6) All this week I have been writing with the white china
container taken out of my ink stand—a horrid object, not at all to
be admired.
As to (7), in a letter written on the following day, Mrs.
Holland says :
Towards the end of the script yesterday I was very much worried
by feeling after a name or names that eluded me. Some foreign
name beginning with H. I was certain of, though " Hugo " did not
content me. "Berg" I was satisfied with, only I wanted something
before it ; and the impression of groping after some fact I could
not get was so strong that I rather wonder if the enclosed paragraph,
copied from to-day's paper, has anything to do with my puzzle
yesterday. . . .
The paragraph was from The Daily Express of March 8th,
1906, and runs as follows:
Berlin—Wednesday, March 7th. Dr. Hermann Lorberg, the
eminent Professor of Physics at the University of Bonn, met with
a fatal mountaineering accident to-day. He was exploring Mount
Venus, near Bonn, when he fell from a great height and was instantly
killed.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 297
It seems to me clear that the coincidence between this
event and the script is purely accidental, partly because it
is so far from exact, and partly because there are no accessory
circumstances suggesting any connection with Dr. Hermann
Lorberg. As an instance of chance coincidence it may, I
think, be profitably compared with the coincidences which
seem to be produced by telepathy.
The " H. M. Minster Berg Hugo " of the script is, I do not

ments on this passage will be found in the section on the
Hodgson control below, p. 306.
Mrs. Verrall's script of March 7th, 1906, is treated of
under the cross-correspondence "Eoden Noel"—below, see p. 316.
Cross-Correspondence—March 7th, 1906.
" Ave Roma Immortalis."
To explain this, it is necessary again to quote several
passages from Mrs. Verrall's script, as follows. I am again
indebted to her for translations of and comments on the
Latin passages.
(March 2nd, 1906.)
(In Latin : Not with such help will you find what you want
;
not with such help, nor with those defenders of yours.) 1
Keep the two distinct—you do not hear write regularly—give
up other things.
(In Latin : First among his peers, himself not unmindful of his
name ; with him a brother related in feeling, though not in blood.
Both these will send a word to you through another woman. After
some days you will easily understand what I say ; till then farewell.) 2
(March 4th, 1906.)
Pagan and Pope. The Stoic persecutor and the Christian.
Gregory not Basil's friend ought to be a clue but you have it not
quite right.
1
Non tali auxilio invenies quod velis non tali auxilio nec defensoribus istis.
This refers to a well-known line in the JEntid {Mntid, II. 521). The words
are used by Heuuba when she sees the old Priam putting on armour in the
vain hope of defending Troy against the victorious and invading Greeks.
2

aliquot dies bene quod dieam comprehendere potes—usque ad illud vale.

Pagan and Pope and Reformer all enemies as you think.
(In Latin : The cross has a meaning. The Cross-bearer who one
day is borne.) 1
The standard-bearer is the link.
(March 5th, 1906.)
(In Latin : The club-bearer [or key-bearer] with the lion's skin
already well described before this in the writings. Some things are
to be corrected.) 2
ask your husband he knows it well.
(In Latin : There stand the columns, where Calpe has been left.
That is the end.) 3
No you have left out something.
(In Latin: The columns [broken] by incessant reading.) 4
Mrs. Verrall noted all the circumstances of the script, Dr.
Verrall's comments on them, and the stages of her own inter-
pretation in her contemporary diaries, and sent me on May 8th,
1906, a full account of the upshot. She told me that she
had recognised at the time in her script of March 2nd
the reference to the JEneicl—the vain defence of Troy against
the Greeks—but that the second Latin passage had no
meaning or association for her. Dr. Verrall, to whom she
showed the script on March 2nd, said then that he saw
a connection between the two Latin passages, but did not
tell her what it was. On March 4th he said, on seeing the
script of that day, that the same intention was shown in
the words " Pagan and Pope," etc. Mrs. Verrall still did
not know what he meant. On March 11th she received
my copy of extracts from Mrs. Holland's script of March
7th and read it to Dr. Verrall. He then said that the
sentence :
" Ave Pioma immortalis. How could I make it
any clearer without giving her the clue ?
" applied appro-
priately to the same thing.
Later in the day he told Mrs. Verrall that her script of
March 2nd had reminded him of Raphael's picture of Attila

terrified by the vision of St. Peter and St. Paul, when
meeting Pope Leo, who went out to save Pome.
The following is an extract which I copy from Mrs.
Verrall's diary of March 11th, 1906.
On March 2nd at lunch I asked him [Dr. Verrall] for the
reference to " Non tali auxilio " and who was described as "Primus
inter pares." He said (1) JEn. II. (2) the Pope. When I read
him the script he said that he saw what it was driving at. I did not.
March 4th seemed to him to add a fresh point and [Mrs. Holland]
on March 7th completes the allusion.
The story told me this morning is this. Allusion on March 2nd
to Raphael's picture of Leo's meeting with Attila, and Attila's
vision of St. Peter and St. Paul. On March 4th my script carries
the allusion to the picture further in "Pagan," "reformer" and
"Crucifer." 1 What of standard-bearer? Possibly on March 5th
" Leonis " and " claviger " are further attempts. [Mrs. Holland's]
allusion :
" Ave Roma immortalis. How could I make it any
clearer without giving her the clue?" seems to complete A.'s
thought.
The following is a copy of Dr. Verrall's original note on
this point, written in Mrs. Verrall's diary.
March llth, 1906. 7 p.m.
I have read the above. ... It is quite correct in all that
concerns me. The reference to JEneid II. and the phrase " pr.
inter p." with the " frater etsi non, etc.," did in fact instantly
recall to me the picture mentioned (doubtless only because I am
specially familiar with it) ; and it was to this picture that I
referred when I said that I had a guess " what it was driving
at," or something to that effect. The rest all followed as described.
A. W. V.
The picture is the well-known one in the Stanza d'Eliodoro
in the Vatican. The Pope sits on a white palfrey, a cross-
bearer riding on his left and cardinals on his right. Attila
on a black horse is in the middle of the picture, with a
standard-bearer in the background on his right and a group
of mounted Huns beyond. St. Peter and St. Paul are descending
from the sky, both bearing swords, and St. Peter also holding
a large key or keys in his left hand. In the background is
seen the city of Eome, with the Coliseum and aqueducts.
300 Alice Johnson. [part
The picture was of course known to Mrs. Yerrall, but,
she writes, had certainly not been recalled to her mind,
consciously at least, by her script.
Analysing the references here, we find
:
(March 2nd, 1906.) The reference to Troy in the first
part of the script introduces the idea of the defence of a
city against an invading host ; Hecuba points out to Priam
the inadequacy of his material weapons in the defence of
Troy. Leo, on the other hand, opposed Attila with moral
or spiritual weapons of defence, which saved the new Troy
—
Rome.
" First among his peers " is a phrase often applied to the
Pope.1
" With him a brother related in feeling though not in blood."
Taking the Pope in this case to be St. Peter, the brother
would be St. Paul ; or the two brothers in feeling might
be the Pope and St. Peter.
(March 4th, 1906.) "Pagan and Pope," appropriate to
Attila and Leo.
" The Stoic persecutor and the Christian— Gregory not Basil's
friend ought to be a clue." This is all very dubious. No
satisfactory interpretation of the " Stoic persecutor and the
Christian " has been suggested.
" Gregory not Basil's friend," may mean, not Gregory
Nazianzen. Perhaps the Gregory meant is Gregory the Great,
the Pope to whom the phrase " Primus inter pares " seems for
historical reasons specially appropriate. There is, however, a
mistake somewhere,—possibly in the introduction of the Stoic
persecutor, —for the script says " you have it not quite right
"
and it goes on in large and emphatic writing, as if with a
struggle to correct itself:
" Pagan and Pope and Reformer—all enemies as you think "
—
that is, as I interpret, you might naturally suppose that the
three types would all be hostile to one another ; but in this
1
In spite of enquiries made in Cambridge, London, and Rome, through
Mrs. Verrall and other friends of mine, I have been unable to find the
origin of the familiar phrase "Primus inter pares." It occurs, however, in
an article on "The Papacy in its relation to American ideals," by the Rev.
L. H. Schwab, in The Hibbert Journal for January, 1908 (p. 276), as follows :
"Any attempted compromise [with the claims of the Papacy] as of a 'primus
inter pares.'
"
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 301
case the Pope and Reformer, namely, Leo (or Sc. Peter) and
St. Paul, are combined against the Pagan, Attila.
" The Cross-bearer who one day is borne " may have a
double reference,—to the cross-bearer in the picture and to the
legend of St. Peter's martyrdom.
" The standard-bearer is the link " may refer to Attila's
standard-bearer, who may be called a link in the sense that
he furnishes one more thread of connection between the script
and the picture,—-in particular because he suggests Attila
himself, who hitherto has been less specifically described than
the other important personages, being merely called the Pagan.
(March 5th, 1906). The word " claviger " may be equally
well translated " club-bearer " or " key-bearer." In this case
it would naturally be interpreted as the " key-bearer " —St.
Peter—and the phrase may mean " The key-bearer in Leo's
skin "—that is, St. Peter as represented by Pope Leo. But
the phrase " lion's skin " seems to suggest the other meaning
of claviger, viz. the club-bearer or Hercules. This leads on
to the next sentence, " There stand the columns where Calpe
[Gibraltar] has been left,"—suggesting (says Mrs. Verrall) the
columns of Hercules, which in turn suggest another reference
to columns :
" columns broken by incessant reading " ; —a quo-
tation from a well-known line of Juvenal, Satire I. 13, referring
to readers who recited or declaimed with so much emphasis
as to break the columns of the hall in which they were
speaking.
It may perhaps be argued that all this is a fanciful interpre-
tation and that the script was not referring to Raphael's picture
at all. The points of resemblance between the description or
descriptions and the picture may be thought to be merely
accidental ; for there are no doubt many features in the picture
which are absent from the description. Indeed the central
idea of the picture—the miraculous deliverance of the sacred
city of Rome from the barbarian—is completely omitted from
the description,—unless it is intended to be suggested by con-
trast with the case of Troy.
But, whether or not the script of March 2nd was really
referring to the picture, it did undoubtedly suggest the picture
to Dr. Verrall, through the conjunction of the two notions of
a weak defender and a Pope, and he was confirmed in this
302 Alice Johnson. [part
interpretation by the script of March 4th. After this he
was on the look-out for further unmistakable allusions in
Mrs. Verrall's script, and when she read him Mrs. Holland's
script of March 7 th, he saw at once its appropriateness to the
incident and the important addition to her own version
furnished by the phrase : Ave Roma immortalis (" Hail
!
Immortal Eome !
")
It is important to note that Mrs. Verrall's script of March
2nd specifically declares that its statements are unintelligible
in themselves and will be explained by what will come through
another automatist. " Both these will send a word to you
through another woman. After some days you will easily
understand what I say." Again on March 5th her script
asserts its own incompleteness :
" Jam finis. No, you have
left out something."
The explanation was given and the omission supplied on
March 7th by Mrs. Holland's phrase: " Ave Eoma immortalis,"
which, as symbolic of the sentiment of the Pope and St. Peter,
corresponds to Mrs. Verrall's :
" Both these will send a word to
you through another woman;" and, by the mention of Eome,
clinches the reference to the picture.
If it be admitted that the connection between the two
scripts goes beyond what can reasonably be put down to
chance, three explanations are possible: (1) though Dr. Verrall
thought very little consciously about the subject except when
actually seeing the script, the whole topic was in his mind,
and a fragment of it may therefore have been transmitted
thence telepathically to Mrs. Holland. (2) Again, it may have
been transmitted telepathically from his mind to Mrs. Verrall's
and from her to Mrs. Holland. (3) Mrs. Verrall may have
interpreted her script subliminally and conveyed the idea of
it telepathically to Mrs. Holland.
But none of these hypotheses explains the fact that Mrs.
Holland's script reproduced nothing that had appeared in
Mrs. Verrall's, but supplied instead the missing factor that
was required to complete Mrs. Verrall's allusions. And the
sentence that follows the phrase in Mrs. Holland's script
:
" How could I make it any clearer without giving her the
clue ?
" indicates what I believe to be an important—if not
essential—feature of the case, —the deliberate intention of the
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 303
control to prevent Mrs. Verrall from understanding or guessing
the meaning of her script ; and by this means to prevent her
from conveying it telepathically to Mrs. Holland. This point
is discussed further in Chapter VII. on "The Theory of Cross-
correspondences."
I may add that just as various names and phrases in
Mrs. Verrall's script led on by association to a number of
topics connected only very indirectly if at all with the main
conception (e.g. the Stoic Persecutor, Hercules, etc.) ; so
apparently the mention of Rome led on in Mrs. Holland's
script to the idea of Mr. Myers's last illness ; for the next
sentence is " How cold it was that winter—even snow in
Eome—we might have stayed at home for that." It is true,
as I find from a letter of that date, that there was snow
in Eome in January, 1901, but the statement is not, of
course, evidential.
The Hodgson Control.
In February, 1905, as mentioned above, Mrs. Holland found
that the automatic writing was beginning to make her feel
faint or sleepy. The condition was obviated at the time
—
apparently by my suggestion to her. It now began to recur.
On Feb. 17th, 1906, she wrote to me:
The enclosed writing [that of Feb. 9th quoted below] dates from
several days ago. I was able to try it early in the evening for once,
and I was anxious to see if the almost stupour which writing has
been causing lately was due to late hours and writing in bed. I
found that even when I was not tired (and sat in a stiff chair well
away from a table, with nothing to support arms or head), a few
moments of writing made me feel at once very sleepy and ex-
ceedingly loquacious. I fancy that under favourable conditions my
automatic writing would change (for a time at any rate) into trance
or semi-trance conditions with spoken words instead of written
ones.
Twice or thrice lately, just before falling asleep at night, I have
heard fragments of talk which I know are not actual conversation,
and as I am in my usual excellent health, perfectly free from
excitement or brain fag of any kind, I can only ascribe them to a
possible new attempt at communication.
It will be observed that this condition seems to coincide
304 Alice Johnson. [part
with the first definite attempt at a communication from a
Hodgson control,

On Feb. 21st, 1906, when, as already stated, I saw Mrs.
Holland, we discussed this script. I found that in spite of the
rather obvious hints given in it,

and " Not haphazard figures read them as letters,"—Mrs. Holland

As mentioned above (p. 282), Mrs. Holland had heard of Dr. Hodgson's
death through a paragraph in a newspaper of January 22nd, 1906.

From "a printed address" to this point is no doubt an attempt to describe
a supposed letter, the three lines being in the original long and wavy, obviously
meant to represent three lines of writing in the letter. The description, however,
is very vague, and has not been identified.

had not deciphered the initial conundrums. The first letters
are formed from the name " Richard Hodgson " by substituting
for each letter of the name the letter following it in the
alphabet ; the numbers represent the same name by substituting
for each letter the number of its place in the alphabet.
I asked Mrs. Holland if she had ever played at conundrums
of this kind. She told me that as a child in the nursery she
had played at a " secret language " made by using either the
letter before or the letter after the real one. But she had
never practised or thought of using numbers in this way. She
noted afterwards :
" When my hand wrote them I thought they
were an addition sum and hoped [my subliminal] would add
it very correctly and quickly. [My supraliminal] is very poor
at figures."
As to the rest of the script
:
Dr. Hodgson died suddenly of heart-disease while playing a
game of handball at the Boat Club in Boston, on December
20th, 1905. There was no preliminary illness, as suggested
in the script. At a subsequent interview with Mrs. Holland
(on May 28th, 1906), I told her a propos of this script that
I was making enquiries but had not yet learnt if anything in
it was correct. She then asked me if he had died of heart-
disease, as she said she knew nitrate of amyl was given for
heart failure, and she suggested this as the interpretation of
the words " Nitrate of amyl—probably too late even if it had
been thought of."
Before making any further comments, it will be convenient
to quote here all the remaining script of this period (Feb. to
May, 1906) which purports to relate to Dr. Hodgson. The
first two passages are quoted with their context elsewhere
(see pp. 292 and 295).

Mr. Piddington was in Boston, U.S.A., during April and May,
1906, and I sent him a copy of the above pieces of script
(except that of May 16th) purporting to relate to Dr. Hodgson
and asked him to make enquiries on the spot. On May 25th,
1906, he wrote as follows:
[In regard to the script of Feb. 9th, 1906], after the experience
gained in the last four weeks, during which I have been going
through all R. H.'s papers, I have no hesitation in saying that to
represent R. H. as communicating his name to a sensitive by means
of numbers representing letters, and especially "sjdibse" etc.,
is an extremely characteristic touch.
"Shortness of breath" etc. has no relevancy for R. H. . . .
"K. 57." I received Miss A. Johnson's copy of extracts from
Mrs. [Holland's] script apparently relating to R. H. this morning
(May 25, 1906) at 8.15 a.m. I thought I had seen on some of R.
H.'s papers some kind of reference mark like K. 57; but felt no
certitude as to this.
LV.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 307
At 9.25 a.m. I reached E. H.'s old rooms at 15 Charles Street,
and after a few minutes noticed a pile of note-books marked by
Henry James, Jr., "College note-books." Among them I noticed a
dilapidated note-book of different size and colour and make, and
proceeded to look at it out of mere curiosity. On the front cover
R. H. had written "The Eternal Life." Inside ate two loose sheets
on which R. H. had made rough notes for an article which he had
apparently intended to write in answer to Prof. Miinsterberg's book,
The Eternal Life. It is known that R. H. was much incensed
by Miinsterberg's book and intended to reply to it. On the back
cover R. H. had written in pencil the following :

The meaning of these memoranda I do not know .... I am
practically certain that K followed by numerals refers to some
particular series of Piper sittings, or to some particular subject of
the communications.
It is at least a curious coincidence that within \\ hours of
receiving and reading Miss Johnson's copy of Mrs. [Holland's]
script I should fortuitously come across a memorandum made by
Hodgson which shows that he used K. followed by a numeral for
some purpose or other. I had previously come across this old note-
book, but had not put it with other notes, note-books, MSS., etc.,

belonging to R. H. which are to be preserved for sentimental
reasons or for 'evidential purposes,' as it seemed to me of no
interest.
I completed the sorting, etc., of all R. H.'s papers yesterday, and
had not this note-book attracted my attention this morning, it
would probably have been destroyed, or perhaps sent to Australia.
[Script of Feb. 28th, 1906.] Description not either very good or
very bad if applied to R. H.
[Script of March 7th, 1906.] In view of what has been said above
about Prof. Hugo Miinsterberg, the obvious reference to him here is
quite appropriate. " Why are they so brutally dense ? H. I always
had a quick temper." These phrases are very like the " R. H.
control " sayings through Mrs. Piper.
J. Gr. PlDDINGTON.
I sent a copy of these passages in the script later to
Professor James's son, Mr. Henry James, Junr., who had been
appointed one of Dr. Hodgson's executors, and he wrote to me
:
July 29th, 1906.
The lines ["a printed address on the sheet of paper, etc."—script
of Feb. 9th, 1906] suggest this to me, —that Hodgson is struggling
to procure the return of letters or papers which he tries to describe.
Mr. Piddington will tell you that the Piper control has abounded
with this sort of request. . . .
I know of no place in Boston frequented by Hodgson where there
was a wide prospect from the windows unless possibly the Union
Boat Club, where he died. Its windows overlook the Back Bay to
some hills beyond. . . .
He wore a gold watch chain on which I find that there is a gold
cigar-cutter of the ordinary type—not at all horse-shoe shaped. I
found an old seal, the stone of which was broken, and which had
a female figure cut on it. It was not worn at the time of his
death. . . .
[In regard to the script of May 16th, 1906] the foliage of one of
our American maples turns a very brilliant red in the autumn, and
its minute flowers are a most brilliant red in the spring. 1
The lines
might be a quotation from some American poem, or something of
Hodgson's own. . . .
I think that the phrases at the end of March 7th are rather like
1
The spring red, which is specially referred to in the script, is probably a far
less familiar fact to English people than the autumn red, and Mrs. Holland
believes that she had never heard of it.
lv ] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 309
Hodgson, as Mr. Piddington says ; but if one can refine on what
is already so refined, they are more like Mrs. Piper's Hodgson
control.
The description of Dr. Hodgson's personal appearance (given
on Feb. 28th) seems to me characteristic; but as his portrait
has been published more than once in illustrated magazines, it
cannot be evidential. Mrs. Holland believes, however, that she
has never seen a portrait of him, and that she had never heard
of him till she read Human Personality.
On March 7th, the various attempts made at the name Hugo
Munsterberg are comparable with the feeling after the name
Eusapia Paladino referred to above (p. 274); but whereas in that
case there is clearly an effort of memory to recall the name,
in this the partial emergence is possibly a telepathic effort
;
for Mrs. Holland, as she told me later, had never heard of
Prof. Munsterberg, who teaches Psychology in Prof. James's
Department in Harvard University and has written against
psychical research.
There is a certain interest in the resemblance between the
kinds of remarks made by the Hodgson control through Mrs.
Piper and through Mrs. Holland. Mrs. Piper was of course
well acquainted with Dr. Hodgson in life, and it was there-
fore natural that in her trance condition some of his
characteristics should come out vividly and indeed in a some-
what accentuated form. But no report of the sittings with her
since his death had been published and there was, so far as I
can see, no normal channel through which her trance conception
of him could have filtered through to Mrs. Holland.
A similar resemblance was found, as mentioned above (p.
271), between the Gurney controls of Mrs. Forbes and of Mrs.
Holland. Here again Mr. Gurney in his life time was known
to Mrs. Forbes but unknown to Mrs. Holland. She knew
both Mr. Gurney and Dr. Hodgson by name through Human
Personality, but there is nothing in that book to suggest in
either case the particular characteristics exhibited by these
controls in her script.
I may add that the Christian name following "K 57" in the
script of Feb. 9th, 1906, and coming at the end of the extract
from the script of Feb. 28th (p. 306), is that of a lady referred
to in Dr. Hodgson's report on his sittings with Mrs. Piper in
u
310 Alice Johnson. [part
Proceedings, Vol. VIII. Of this lady " Phinuit " remarked " The
second part of her first name is sie." Dr. Hodgson after-
wards told him the full name, but this was not published, the
lady being spoken of in the rest of the report as " Q." It was
the full Christian name which was given by Mrs. Holland, who
—it is to be remembered—had not seen the Proceedings at all.
On Peb. 28th the script said "The young wife died so long
ago that perhaps some people forgot her." " Q." died in
1879, but she was, I believe, never married. The name had
also occurred in Mrs. Holland's script on Dec. 1st, 1905
(i.e. 19 days before Dr. Hodgson's death), at the beginning of a
passage which has apparently no connection with what comes
before or after it, as follows
:
Thus the name occurs three times in apparent connection
with Dr. Hodgson, for I hazard the conjecture that the Greek
cross here may represent the symbol of Mrs. Piper's main
control Eector, and so indicate a connection with Dr. Hodgson.
In Mrs. Verrall's report of her script, she states (Proceedings,
Vol. XX. p. 77) that the Greek cross occurs in it as a
symbolic signature on nine occasions, and on six out of the
nine reference is made in the script either to Dr. Hodgson
or to Mrs. Piper, while on another occasion it is stated to
be the sign of Eector.

(op. cit. pp. 78 and 404) is very similar to the above by Mrs.
Holland.
Two Crcss-correspondences.
(1) " Not in the Plectra" and (2) "Henry was not ?nistctken."
On Feb. 8th, 1906, I sent Mrs. Verrall a copy of Mrs.
Holland's script of Feb. 6 th (quoted in the preceding chapter,

It was the sign used by the Rector control of Mr. Stainton Moses ; see
Proceedings, Vol. IX. p. 285 and Vol. XI. p. 41.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 311
p. 283) including an attempt —here reproduced—to write some
Greek words.
Mrs. Verrall did not happen to note at the time, and
—
owing to the illegibility of a postmark—it cannot now be
positively proved, whether or not she received this script
before 10.20 a.m. on Feb. 9 th when she wrote the script to
be next quoted. The point being doubtful, we must obviously,
to be on the safe side, assume that Mrs. Verrall did see
Mrs. Holland's script before producing her own, which contains
a certain Greek line, and in that case it may possibly be
surmised that Mrs. Holland's script suggested to Mrs. Verrall
that an attempt was on foot to make the former write
Greek automatically, whereupon Mrs. Verrall's script proceeded,
as it were, to set her a specific Greek quotation to be
reproduced.
In regard to the second cross-correspondence, it is to be
premised that Mrs. Verrall knew at this time that the Life of
Dr. Sidgwick, referred to in her script, was about to appear,
whereas Mrs. Holland probably did not know this.
The following are the passages in Mrs. Verrall's script
bearing on these points
:
(Feb. 9, 1904 [really 1906]. 10.20 a.m.)
(In Latin and Greek : They grow faint, but (are) not without

In the Life of Sidgwick you will find two clues to what I have
said to you, two only—follow the thread. It shld be on March 17
note that day. But I cannot see where you are then at some place
I do not know.

In regard to this script, Mrs. Verrall noted that she took
it at the time to refer to Mrs. Holland.
(Feb. 20, 1906. 7 p.m.)
Get her to write (In Greek : sorrow sorrow) 3
and the rest. . . .
On February 21st, 1906, when as related above, p. 290,
Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Holland met in my room at 20 Hanover
Square, and tried writing there simultaneously, the first part
of Mrs. Verrall's script referred again to a green book as
follows :
The green book must be found with the swan on it. There is
verse inside. The swan is gilt and quite conspicuous.
We discussed what book this could be, but none of us
could guess, and next day Mrs. Holland wrote to me that she
had not been able to find the book. Mrs. Verrall, on going-
home, identified it as Mr. G. Murray's Euripides (containing
translations of Hij^olytus, Bacchce and Aristophanes' Frogs), but
this, of course, was not mentioned to Mrs. Holland, and again
in writing to me on March 7th, Mrs. Holland said that she
had sought in vain for the book.
On Feb. 28th Mrs. Verrall wrote:

Orange nob the fruit. The name of a place at school next the
Blucher Beckford.
Not so clear for the first few lines — Echo answers—an admirer of
Jane Austen some one has lately read her novel aloud to a sick
friend.
But note the point about Orange that has meaning
—
(In Greek : Be sorrow, sorrow spoken, but let the good prevail)
Mrs. Verrall notes on this script that " Orange " and
" Blucher " are the names of two adjoining dormitories at
Wellington College (Dr. Verrall's old school) and " Beckford
"
may, Dr. Verrall suggests, be intended for another one
—
Beresford. A copy of this script, omitting the Greek line, was
sent to Mrs. Holland on March 5th, but nothing in it seemed
to apply to her.
Meanwhile in her script of Feb. 28th, quoted in full above,
p. 293 occurs the phrase: " No, not in the Electra, M. will
know better."
" M." is of course Mrs. Verrall (often called " Margaret " or
" M." in Mrs. Holland's script) and indicates that the remark
is specially intended for her. It may be taken to apply
to the Greek line quoted by Mrs. Verrall for the third time
on Feb. 28th, for this line, Mrs. Verrall tells me, is the
burden of the chorus relating to the expedition to Troy and
the sacrifice of Iphigenia (iEschylus, Agamemnon, 124, 125).
There is a certain point, Mrs. Verrall thinks, in mentioning
the Electra in this connection, because the Electra (of Sophocles
and Euripides) is equivalent to the second play (Libation
Bearers) of the iEschylean Trilogy, of which the Agamemnon
is the first ; so that Mrs. Holland's script might be taken
to mean : the line is in the Trilogy, but not in the second
play ( = Electra), which was true.
It should be added that Mr. Gilbert Murray's translation of
Euripides' Electra, published in 1905, was being performed in
London at about this time, though I do not think this can
be considered enough to account for the connection between
the two scripts.
Returning now to the prediction in Mrs. Verrall's script of
Feb. 9th, 1906, quoted above, that she would find "two clues
314 Alice Johnson. [part
to what I have said to you " in the Life of Dr. Sidgwick ; the
book was published on Feb. 27th, and Mrs. Verrall obtained
it next clay and at once began to search for the " clues " and
found what she regarded as one of them. (See her Report,
pp. 277-8 and 415.)
In her script of July 8th, 1901, was the following:
You have got it partly right, but he knows better what I mean.
Edmund Gurney helped me at first —now there is no one but me
—
We talked together of it, —in the sunny weather,—in the Cloisters 1
on Sunday before he knew you. Two of us and then some one
came. He has more nearly carried out his plans than I have—tell
him that, A. W. V. —from me and he will know what I mean. I
was wrong in part, I see now—but not altogether.
This script, in Mrs. Verrall's opinion at the time, purported
to come from Dr. Sidgwick.
The script recurred to the same topic on November 25th,
1901, after some allusions to Mr. F. M. Balfour and to a basket
associated elsewhere with Dr. Sidgwick, as follows
:
I wrote in the Alps [the script of July 8th, 1901, was written
in the Eiffel Alp] about a talk in the College Court on a Sunday
with your husband—not for her to recognise but for him— Then
other things were mixed in, —the play and the rest. But now ask
him to recollect in the Long—we talked about our work His has
been largely carried out, mine not. He must remember. It is so
plain to me. Now sign initials F M B
It seemed uncertain whether this communication purported
to come from Dr. Sidgwick or from Mr. Balfour. In any case
Dr. Ar
errall, to whom it seemed to relate, had no special
recollection of such talks as were described.
In the Memoir of Dr. Sidgwick (p. 589) is given a letter
written on May 29th, 1900 (two days before the operation
performed in the hope of prolonging his life), to his old friend
Sir George Trevelyan, in which the following occurs
:
My thoughts go back to the old days when we walked round
the cloisters and talked of Life and the spirit in which it should
be lived. You have fulfilled your promise better than I.
1 " The Cloisters " would to anv Trinity mau mean the cloisters of Trinity
College.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 315
This passage coincides strikingly with the script in that it
speaks of a talk in the (Trinity) cloisters with some one who,
Dr. Sidgwick considered, had been more successful than him-
self in carrying out his plans for his life-work. But here
the talk was with Sir George Trevelyan, whereas the script
refers it to Dr. Verrall.
Mrs. Holland's script of Feb. 28th, 1906 (see above, p. 293),
contains the phrase :
" Henry was not mistaken " (" Henry " in her script always
meaning Dr. Sidgwick), which applies well to what was
occupying Mrs. Verrall's mind on that day.
On receiving from me on March 6th a copy of Mrs.
Holland's script, Mrs. Verrall wrote to me
:
" Henry was not mistaken " closely corresponds with my own
preoccupation on [Feb.] 28th connected with a clue in the [Memoir
of Dr. Sidgwick] to something in my script. Mrs. Sidgwick will
confirm. I told her that confirmation from [Mrs. Holland] was
wanted and this is exactly appropriate.
On this point Mrs. Sidgwick sent me the following note
:
March 6th, 1906.
Mrs. Verrall called on me on Wednesday, Feb. 28th, and told
me she had procured a copy of my husband's memoir, published
the day before, and was eagerly reading it, as her script had said
that the book would furnish two clues. She thought that one of
these was in the great resemblance between something contained
in the script of two or three years ago about talking in the cloisters
of Nevile's Court with a passage in my husband's letter to Sir George
Trevelyan, quoted on p. 589 of the book, though there were some
inconsistencies showing a mistake somewhere. (I have given the
substance of our conversation. I am not sure that the word
" mistake " was used.) She told me that it was the day on which
she and Mrs. [Holland] sat for automatic writing simultaneously,
and said it would be very interesting if Mrs. [Holland's] script were
to show any indication of this matter which was occupying her (Mrs.
Verrall's) mind so much. The resemblance between the passages
in the letter and in the script seemed to me very striking.
My conversation with Mrs. Verrall took place between 8 and
9 p.m.
Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick.

Cross-correspondence.

Recurring once more to the prediction in Mrs. Verrall's script
of Feb. 9th, 1906: "In the Life of Sidgwick you will find
two clues to what I have said to you, two only—follow the
thread " ; Mrs. Verrall soon found what she took to be the
second clue, namely, an explanation of some phrases in her
script of Jan. 17th, 1904 (quoted above, p. 226), unintelligible
to her at the time, about the " Wanderer on the Way " and
" Hope's vision which is the true one and leads on the
Passionate Pilgrim." Some other phrases about the same time
and apparently relating to the same topic were :
" my pilgrim
foot," " the ways we walked together," " wander at will . . .
wandering still."
Mrs. Verrall now read in the Memoir (see her Report,
p. 298) a letter in which Dr. Sidgwick, speaking of the
question of immortality, says :
" There was one line of thought
I wanted to suggest, in which, from time to time, I find a
kind of repose,—which, curiously enough, I find is that in
which Browning's poem on the subject (' La Saisiaz '
) con-
cludes. It is that on moral grounds hope rather [than]
certainty is fit for us in this earthly existence." This
led Mrs. Verrall to read La Saisiaz, which to the best of
her belief she had never read before. It describes the sudden
death of a friend, after which the poet takes alone the walk
which they had planned to take together, and debating with
himself the question of immortality, concludes as described by
Dr. Sidgwick. Some expressions in the poem bear a certain
resemblance to the phrases just quoted from Mrs. Verrall's script,
and the whole may not inaptly be described as an account
of the vision of hope which comes to the wandering pilgrim.
As Mrs. Verrall observes, the likenesses between the script
and the poem may, in spite of her impression to the contrary,
be due to a latent knowledge of the poem, or of some account
of it, in her mind. But it is interesting that the phrases
should be associated with Dr. Sidgwick's name ; for this script
purports to be an attempt to produce a verifiable message
from him in answer to Mrs. Sidgwick's question about the
text (see above, p. 220), while afterwards a certain verification
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 317
or explanation of the phrases was found in a letter of which
Mrs. Verrall certainly had no normal knowledge, written by
Dr. Sidgwick in 1878 to a friend of his with whom she was
not acquainted.
This friend was Mr. Eoden Noel, and the letter (see Memoir,
p. 338) was about his poems written in memory of his little
son Eric, and published in 1881 under the title of "A Little
Child's Monument." Mrs. Verrall had been chiefly interested
in the part of the letter dealing with La Saisiaz, but it may
be surmised that Eoden Noel's connection with it led—whether
normally or supernormally—to the verses produced in her
next script, which I now quote. Mrs. Verrall did not in any
way associate this script with Eoden Noel at the time, and
remains convinced, after my later discussion of it with her,
that she had never read any of his poems.
(March 7, 1906. 11.15 p.m.)
S let it come. Myriad red buds and in each the promise of a
flower and fruit to come. But you must wait.
Can't you see Mrs. [Holland] soon 1 Send her something of yours,

She wrote earlier to-day in the afternoon alone. She sat on a sofa
and put her book down suddenly, half open on the table.
But why a headache on this lovely day.
Tintagel and the sea that moaned in pain
And Arthur's mount uplifted from the plain
And crowding towers of quaint fantastic shape
Ah ! never more to see
The ripples dance
Nor hear again the roar
On smitten shore
Where the huge wave rolls on
Amid the salt and savour of the sea.
It was only while writing this report that it occurred to
me that these verses have a certain vague resemblance to
Eoden Noel's poem " Tintadgel," which, like Mrs. Verrall's
first three lines, is composed of ten-syllabled rhymed couplets.
I quote a few lines to show the resemblance
:
" Tintadgel, from thy precipice of rock
Thou frownest back the vast Atlantic shock !
318 Alice Johnson. [part
Yet purple twilight in cathedral caves
Moulded to the similitude of waves
Tempestuous by awful hands of storm
*****
And therefore Arthur's ancient ramparts range
From human fellowship to nature, change
To semblance of the fretted weathered stone,
Upreared by mystic elements alone."
Mrs. Verrall, as already stated, believes that she had never
seen or heard of this poem until I drew her attention to it
a few days after reading it for the first time myself in
January, 1908.
Now for Mrs. Holland's side. I sent her a copy of Mrs.
Verrall's script of March 7th, 1906, and she wrote to me
that it did not apply to her at all, nor apparently did the
verses suggest anything to her. But her next script gives
the date May 26th, 1894, which I found to be that of
Roden Noel's death, and definite references to him appear
shortly afterwards. She told me later that she (like Mrs.
Verrall) knew little or nothing of him, but thought she had
seen one or two poems by him in some volume of selections.
Before writing the script to be next quoted, Mrs. Holland
had, as she told me a few days later, read two reviews (in
the Westminster Gazette and Daily Chronicle) of the Memoir
of Dr. Sidgwick, but had not seen the book itself. She knew
nothing of Mrs. Verrall having found in it points bearing on
her script, but knew, of course, that we should be greatly
interested in it on other grounds. The normal cause, then,
influencing the script quoted below would be the reviews of
the Memoir, known to her normal consciousness ; to which may
possibly be added a subliminal recollection of the date of Roden
Noel's death, evoked by a subliminal recognition of the resem-
blance between Mrs. Verrall's verses and his. His name is
not mentioned in either of the two reviews, so that they could
not have suggested to her any connection between him and
Dr. Sidgwick. The following is her script
:
(March 11th, 1906.)
You find all that has arrived thus far too nebulous—and under
existing conditions it is not surprising it should be so — Let us
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 319
first establish a recognised channel of communication that has
already taken years and may take years longer—very possibly
—
afterwards the quality of the messages may improve and become
more definite.
This is for A. W. Ask him what the date May -J 6th 1894
meant to him—to me—and to F. W. H.
I do not think they will find it hard to recall but if so—let them
ask Nora.
We no more solve the riddle of Death by dying than we solve
the problem of Life by being born— Take my own case — I was
always a seeker—until it seemed at times as if the quest was more
to me than the prize— Only the attainments of my search were
generally like rainbow gold alway beyond aud afar— It is not
all clear—I seek still—only with a confirmed optimism more perfect
and beautiful than any we imagined before— I am not oppressed
with the desire that animates some of us to share our knowledge
or optimism with you all before the time. You kuow who feels
like that but I am content that you should wait. The Solution of
the Great Problem I could not give you—I am still very far away
from it and the abiding knowledge of the inherent truth and Beauty
into which all the inevitable uglinesses of Existence finally resolve
themselves will be yours in due time. . . .
In sending me this script Mrs. Holland wrote
:
[I enclose] some unexpected script, which wrote itself very easily
a few minutes ago. By writing itself I mean there was not the
frequent feeling of striving and groping. I wonder if you can fit
a name to it; it is certainly not " F. M." or " E. G.'
:
How glad
I should be if the date given was a definite bit of evidence from
Dr. Hodgson; but I know I am meant to be kept in the dark
just now, so please take this last sentence as not written. . . .
This shows that Mrs. Holland did not, at least consciously,
associate the date with Mr. Roden Noel. Nor did " A. W."
(Dr. Verrall), though he knew him slightly. He was also
known, though not intimately, to " F. W. H." (Mr. Myers).
It was, however, appropriate that we should be told to ask
" Nora " (Mrs. Sidgwick) if we could not find out for ourselves,
since he was an intimate friend of Dr. Sidgwick's.
The reflections that follow (" We no more solve the riddle
of Death by dying," etc.), which purport to be inspired by Dr.
Sidgwick, are clearly derived from the review in the Westminster
320 Alice Johnson. [part
Gazette. From this review,—which takes up nearly two columns
of the paper, and deals with many different topics out of the
book,—it is not unnatural that Mrs. Holland's subliminal self
should select for paraphrase in her script an extract from a
letter addressed to Mr. Myers, especially as the review states
that the latter described it as the most interesting letter he had
ever received from Dr. Sidgwick. The extract is as follows
:
My difficulty is that I cannot give to principles of conduct either
the formal certainty that comes from exact science or the practical
certainty that comes from a real Consensus of Experts. And I feel
that your peculiar phase of the " Maladie " is due to the fact that
you demand certainty with special peremptoriness—certainty estab-
lished either emotionally or intellectually. I sometimes feel with
somewhat of a profound hope and enthusiasm that the function of
the English mind, with its uncompromising matter-of-factness, will
be to put the final question to the Universe with a solid, passionate
determination to be answered which must come to something. How-
ever, in the meantime we have to live on less than certainty, which
for you is peculiarly difficult. (Memoir, p. 259.)
That Mr. Myers attached particular value to this letter is
shown by the fact that it is the one letter quoted in his
paper, " In Memory of Henry Sidgwick " (Proceedings S.P.K.,
Vol. XV. p. 455).
The extract just quoted is clearly the basis of this
passage in the script :
" I am not oppressed with the desire
that animates some of us to share our knowledge or optimism
with you all before the time. You know who feels like
that, but I am content that you should wait." Yet there
remains the remarkable coincidence that the sentiment repre-
sented in Mrs. Holland's script should resemble so closely the
" clue " just found in the Memoir by Mrs. Verrall to her own
early script,
—" that on moral grounds hope rather than certainty
is fit for us in this earthly existence,"—and that this should
be associated in Mrs. Holland's script with the date of Eoden
Noel's death, whereas it was in a letter to Eoden Noel that
Mrs. Verrall had found her " clue."
Mrs. Holland's next script begins as follows
:
(March 14th, 1906.) Eighteen fifteen four five fourteen— Fourteen
fifteen five twelve — Not to be taken as they stand. See Rev.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 321

*****
H. S. [in monogram] E. N. [in monogram] June 1st 1881 (?)
Surely you will not need to ask about that . . .
Revelation, xiii, 18 is as follows: "Here is wisdom. Let
him that hath understanding count the number of the beast ; for
it is the number of a man ; and his number is Six hundred
three score and six
;
" and " the central 8 words " of this text
are :
" for it is the number of a man." Acting on this hint
given by the script as to its own proper interpretation, I
substituted for the initial numbers " eighteen fifteen " etc., the
corresponding letters of the alphabet, and found that they
formed the name " Eoden Noel." I found afterwards that
Mrs. Holland had not looked up the text and had no idea of
what it was or of what the numbers meant.
Nevertheless in her script of Feb. 9th, 1906 (given above
in the section on the Hodgson control, see p. 304), the name
" Eichard Hodgson " had been similarly represented by numbers,
which I had interpreted to her on Feb. 21st. The numbers
in that case, however, were written in figures and arranged in
two columns, looking like addition sums. The fact of their
being written in words in the case of Eoden Noel probably
prevented her supraliminal self from recognising that the same
form of conundrum was being used again.
I have not found any significance in the date "June 1st
1881 " (the query after " 1881 " is part of the original script).
The next passage which I take to refer to Eoden Noel
occurs in Mrs. Holland's script of March 21st, 1906 (quoted in
full below, see p. 335). It begins in blank verse, as follows:
A golden haze hung o'er the dying day
And dimmed the rising radiance of the stars
The tender mist from where the river winds
Eose in transparent veils of thinnest lawn
A mist more felt than visioned
—
1
In the trees—the smaller birds were clamourous while
the rooks
1
The line begins at this point in the original, though, according to the metre,
the words "in the trees" obviously belong to the end of the previous line.

—
Was I a drone—at least there was honey within my reach—even if
I brought none to the hive.
It is the word " Cornish " here which specially suggested
Eoden Noel to me, as he had many associations with Cornwall.
(I ought to say that in the original script the word is rather
illegible, but I believe it to be " Cornish," and Mrs. Verrall
without any suggestion from me read it as such.) The blank
verse seems Tennysonian in general intention, and the description
is suggestive of the Cambridge " Backs," in which rooks are a
rather prominent feature. The whole may be taken to refer
to Dr. Sidgwick's early life and friendships at Cambridge,
Pioden Noel being a friend of his when he was an under-
graduate ; and the sentence :
" Was I a drone ? At least
there was honey within my reach, even if I brought none to
the hive,"-—may be taken to mean that Boden Noel was
a man of strong poetic sensibilities, although his own contri-
butions to literature met with little recognition.
This whole interpretation may no doubt appear fanciful, but
in support of it I quote from a letter written by Dr. Sidgwick
immediately after Mr. Noel's death to his widow :
I have been thinking ... of the early years of our friendship
when we talked and wrote to each other, in the eagerness of youth,
on all things in heaven and earth. I have always felt that though
he was keenly disappointed by the world's inadequate recognition of
his genius, he did his work in life none the less resolutely and
brought out his great gifts and remained nobly true to his ideal
(Henri/ Sidgwick; a Memoir, p. 531).
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 323
The idea symbolised in the script,
—"at least there was
honey within my reach,"—is again expressed in a letter from
Dr. Sidgwick to Mr. Noel's sister, Lady Victoria Buxton (op.
cit. p. 531).
I . . . never came away from a talk with him without feeling
afresh the variety and richness of his nature and his sensitiveness to
all things beautiful in nature and all things noble or pathetic in
human life. I never knew any one who seemed more at home in
that higher region of thought and feeling,—into which some of us
rise occasionally with some effort, —where the great realities of human
life and destiny are not only intellectually grasped, but felt with full
intensity.
It is to be noted that this last passage is quoted in the
Preface to The Collected Poems of Eoden Noel, brought out by
his sister in 1902,—from which book, as observed below, many
of the references to him both in Mrs. Holland's and Mrs.
Verrall's scripts are derivable, though they both believe that
they have never seen it.
I quote next a piece of script by Mrs. Verrall. At the
time of writing this, Mrs. Verrall had not seen Mrs. Holland's
script of March 14th about Eoden Noel, but had seen that of
March 21st. I think it extremely improbable, however, that
this latter should have suggested Eoden Noel to her. She
wrote as follows
:
(March 25th, 1906. 11 p.m.) (In Latin: A philosopher nor
without ambition; clearly denoted, although not recognised.) 1
A cap of liberty not worn. There is a cap a three-cornered cap
and a tassel more like this
[Three rough drawings of a cap occur in the middle of the last
sentence.]
This script was not sent to me at the time, as it was not
written on one of the days fixed for experiments between the
two automatists, so that I did not see it until I was preparing
this report.
The description is of course vague and might apply to a
good many persons ;
yet, as far as it goes, it is certainly
appropriate to Mr. Noel. When I showed it to Mrs. Sidgwick
1

and asked her if she did not think it suggestive of him, she
said at once that it seemed to her a very good description of
him. One of the deepest interests of his life was philosophy,
and he was certainly not without literary ambitions, as
mentioned above. He had a keen and vivid sympathy with
the poor and oppressed—whether classes or nationalities—and
many of his poems refer to subjects of this kind ;
see, e.g.,
Garibaldi and The Red Flag. The " cap of liberty " of the
script may be regarded as symbolical of this sentiment in him.
The phrase " clearly denoted, although not recognised," seems
to indicate that the person has previously been designated in
Mrs. Verrall's script, but not yet identified ;
which, as we
have seen, was true of Roden Noel.
The next reference to Roden Noel by name in Mrs.
Holland's script occurs on March 28th, 1906, as follows:
How loudly that clock strikes [the script was begun at midnight,
and probably a clock had just struck].
Percival. Roden Noel—Settle—Seattle Seittle —Cornwall—Where
the one long street seemed to lead directly to the blue sea.
Clear eyes under a broad brow—a shock of grey hair that was
still thick. Not tall—Do you remember the velvet jacket. Patter-
son. No the long pipe —not the little short old one
—
Both Roden Noel and Mr. (A. J.) Patterson were, Mrs.
Sidgwick tells me, undergraduate friends of Dr. Sidgwick's, so
that there is a certain appropriateness in their being mentioned
together. Mr. Patterson is mentioned as a friend and corre-
spondent of Dr. Sidgwick's in the Westminster Gazette review
referred to above, in which Roden Noel's name does not
occur.
The latter's personal appearance, which is correctly described
in the script—including the velvet jacket which was char-
acteristic of him-—is shown in the portrait prefixed to his
Collected Poems, published in 1902. In the preface to this,
the date of his death is mentioned, and the extract quoted
above from the letter to his sister from " his friend, the late
Dr. Henry Sidgwick " is given. The same book contains poems
of his about Cornwall.
In regard to Mrs. Holland's conscious knowledge of all these
matters, I saw her on May 28th, 1906, and went rapidly
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 325
through with her most of the script that she had written up
to that date. When we came to the script of March 11th,
1906, she asked me if the date "May 26th, 1894 " had any
significance. I told her it was the date of Eoden Noel's death
and showed her the later references to him. She said she
had not interpreted, nor—I understood—attempted to interpret
the script of March 14th; that she knew nothing of Eoden
Noel beyond his name and one or two sonnets which she
had read in a book of selections. She felt sure she had never
seen a portrait of him or heard of his wearing a velvet jacket.
I did not tell her of the references to him in Mrs. Verrall's
script, since I had not then detected them.
After discovering the resemblance between Mrs. Verrall's
verses of March 7th, 1906, and Eoden Noel's poem, I wrote
to Mrs. Holland on Feb. 6th, 1908, reminding her that
these verses (which I then quoted again) had occurred in
Mrs. Verrall's script early in 1906, and adding: "I want
to know if you recognise this—especially the first three
lines—or if it strikes you as being like any verses you
know, and if so what. Please think carefully over this. It
may suggest an author to you, if not a poem."
Mrs. Holland replied :
In answer to your question about the verses in Mrs. Verrall's
script early in 1906, "Tintagel and the sea that moaned in pain,
etc.," as soon as I read them, I said "Eoden Noel, of course!"
though, as my knowledge of his poems is limited to the two . . .
quoted in the Oxford Book of English Verse, 1
I could not explain
why the name occurred to me. But on looking up my script for
1906, I see it is given in figures on March 14th and in words on
March 28th.
I then sent Mrs. Holland the first proofs of this chapter,
saying that these would show why I had asked the question
and asked further :
" Did you say Eoden Noel because you
remembered that you had had references to him early in
1906 and from that inferred the right answer to my question?
Or [do you think that] you subliminally recognised the
verses, either when you first saw them in 1906, or when
I quoted them to you just now ?
"
1
The poem "Tintadgel" is not one of these two.

326 Alice Johnson. [part
Mrs. Holland replied to me on April 16th, 1908:
I can only conclude that my exclamation :
" Roden Noel, of
course
!
" after reading Mrs. Verrall's verses quoted in your letter
was due to a telepathic influence exerted by your letter. The verses
meant nothing at all to me when you sent them to me before,
and I have read nothing since that throws any light upon them.
The conviction came instantly, as an impression gained from a
letter often does come with me. I remembered afterwards that
" Percival—Roden Noel " had been written in my script before
what purported to be a description ... I know I have never
seen a volume of his poems. The one sonnet quoted in Sonnets of
this Century and the two short poems in the Oxford Book of English
Verse are all that I know of his writings—no reference to Cornwall
in them. I can speak of this with certainty, for I am very fond
of verse and always remember if I come across a volume by a
minor poet whom I have seen quoted.
It had before been obvious to me, from the numerous
quotations in Mrs. Holland's script, that she read a good
deal of poetry and remembered a good deal of what she read,
and she has generally been able to tell me at least the
author, if not the source, of the quotations. I had also
learnt incidentally through a friend of hers of a small
instance showing a remarkably retentive conscious memory
of poetry on her part. All this goes to confirm her belief
that she would have known if she had seen Roden Noel's
poem.
To sum up the various items relating to this topic, it will
be seen that in neither of the scripts does a single statement
occur that is provdbly unknown to the writers. Neither of
them recognises what her script is referring to ; to both, when
I interpret it to them, the facts appear as something not only
unfamiliar, but completely new, as if heard for the first time.
And it is not unlikely that they were actually heard then for the
first time. But since they are all either stated in or derivable
from printed sources, it is impossible to prove that Mrs. Verrall
and Mrs. Holland had not once seen these sources, which might
have been utilised by their subliminal memory.
The productions of neither automatist, then, taken alone, can be
regarded as clear evidence of communication from an indepen-
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 327
dent external intelligence, such as the surviving individuality
of Dr. Sidgwick or of Mr. Noel. The important point in this,
as in many other cross-correspondences, lies not in either
script taken by itself, but in the connection between the
two,—in the fact of the same topic occurring in both, though
in very different forms, and recognised by neither writer.
Coincidental Reference to Physical Phenomena.
Mrs. Holland's script of March 14th, 1906, the first part
of which is quoted above, p. 320, goes on:
How M. V. is knitting her brows— A W preserves the accustomed
attitude of semi-humourous [sic] interest—-A little aloof perhaps—but
far more for than against.
Don't let P. temporize the whole thing had better be pub-
lished.
It's a pity R. has no sense of humour but not unusual for his
nationality. It gives him a certain power too—some of us were
too whimsical perhaps are. Look at L. for instance
—
Stand by the faith that is in you— Mr. Facing Both Ways has
not grown more bearable since Pilgrims Progress days— When
faith is hopelessly lacking I am tempted to wish that a little good
old-fashioned prejudice might take its place
—
A long feather on a very flexible stem—easily concealed in her
dress and not very difficult for a person of her accomplishments to
produce— For spirit touches it is of course excellent.
Perverted honesty —giving something for the money at any rate
—
What can you expect from that particular scale of fees— Bark is
no good—a shaded light at first—if you like—but not darkness
—
Try with unpaid ones in July—and the second time will be worth
it— G.
The first paragraph here refers again to Mrs. Verrall's report
on her script, then (as Mrs. Holland knew) being prepared, and
the description of Dr. Verrall's (" A. W.") mental attitude in
regard to it seems to me remarkably appropriate. The next
sentence no doubt refers to the same matter, " P." being Mr.
Piddington, with whom Mrs. Verrall had had much discussion
about the publication of her Report. The sentence, however,
does not represent his view at all correctly.
The second part of the script, the last passage of which is
signed by the Gurney control, recurs to the subject of
328 Alice Johnson. [part
" physical phenomena " treated of in the script during the
latter part of 1905. I do not know if the device suggested
for producing " spirit touches " has ever been used by mediums.
On March 13th, the day before this script was written, I
had received from Mr. Andrew Lang an Algerian paper, Lcs
JVouvellcs, of March 5th, 1906, containing an attack by Dr.
Eouby (of Algiers) on the Algerian " materialisations " reported
by Professor Eichet. I at once wrote to Dr. Eouby asking
for further information, and discussed the subject with Mr.
Feilding either on March 13th or 14th. I mentioned above
(p. 273) that Mrs. Holland's script first referred to "physical
phenomena " on the day that I had had a special discussion
with Mr. Feilding about Eusapia Paladino. Here again, after
a long interval, she recurs to the subject just when it was
occupying our minds to an unusual extent.
Eeports of the Algerian sittings had appeared in the Annals
of Psychical Science for October, 1905, and following numbers,
and Dr. Eouby's attack was first mentioned in the Annals
in April, 1906. Mrs. Holland saw these accounts for the
first time in the middle of the latter month.
Experiments with Mrs. Vekrall on the supposed influence
of inanimate objects.
Mrs. Holland had received from me a copy of Mrs. Verrall's
script of March 7th, containing the sentence:
" Send [Mrs. Holland] something of yours, a ring, that would
help her"; and wrote to me on March 11th, 1906: "The
suggestion about the ring interests me. Would Mrs. Verrall
care to try the experiment of exchanging rings for a few
weeks ? One that she has had a long time would be the
best. If so, will you let me know and I will send her one
of mine direct."
I conveyed this suggestion to Mrs. Verrall, asking her if
she would send a ring direct to Mrs. Holland. She did so,
with the following message only
:
This ring has never been worn by any one but me and has been
taken straight from my finger. I am leaving home to-morrow for
a round of visits ;
my letters will be forwarded, but if you would
like to send me a ring of yours, which I should much like to try,
will you wait till April, when I shall be at home again.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 329
Mrs. Holland received the ring by the first post on the
morning of March loth, and immediately after receiving it, had
an impression which she noted down at once and sent to Mrs.
Verrall the same day, in a letter in which she said
:
March 15th, 1906.
. . . While I was dressing this morning and thinking of you
and the ring, I had such a vivid impression of a room that I noted
it down instantly and send you a copy of my notes. As it was
not automatic script, I spare you my untidy pencil scribble. The
lady in brown hardly seemed to be you, but the room had to do
with you. . . .
The note enclosed was as follows
:
(March 15th, 1906. 8.45 a.m.)
A dining room, narrow for its height, a long room. Dull red
paper on the wall ; brown wood dado or high wainscot. A great
deal of brass about the fireplace. Table laid for a meal, bright
fire. Something Egyptian in the room, or else ornaments of an
" Egyptian pattern."
Lady in brown dress reading letter. Is it Mrs. V. 1
An elaborate coffee-making machine and a silver urn.
Green-handled knives.
Honeycomb. Indian tree patterned china.
Mrs. Verrall sent me this letter with its enclosure in its
original envelope, showing that Mrs. Holland had addressed it
to her at Cambridge, from whence it had been forwarded to
her to the house of " Mrs. Forbes," where she was then
staying. I must again remind the reader that this happened
some time before the publication of Mrs. Verrall's Eeport on
her script, in which " cross-correspondences " with Mrs. Forbes
are described. It seems impossible, therefore, that Mrs. Holland
could have been led by any normal means to guess where
Mrs. Verrall was going. Even if she had known the address
it would not have helped her much, for Mrs. Forbes, whose
confirmation of the case is given below, told me later, that
she did not know Mrs. Holland and, as far as she knew,
they had no mutual friends or acquaintances.
Mrs. Verrall wrote to me that she had not replied to Mrs.
Holland's letter, but that both Mr. and Mrs. Forbes agreed
330 Alice Johnson. [part
that the description recalled their dining-room unmistakeably.
Mrs. Verrall's full report to me was as follows
:
March 17th, 1906.
Note on '
' Impression " received from [Mrs. Holland] on Friday evening,
March 16th, 9 p.m., at above address.
Dining-room : not narrow for height ;
large room rather than
long.
Dull red paper.
Below two windows is brown wood panelling and there is a door
opposite, brown to match. The mantelpiece, brown oak, reaches to
the bottom of the frieze, i.e. to same height as paper. Beside it
oak book-shelves cover the wall. There is a dark oak sideboard
and other dark oak furniture, standing against the wall. I had
a strong impression of brown wood and red, and had to go into
the room to see whether there was a dado. Great deal of brass about
fireplace, viz. fender, etc., "basket grate," two huge brass plates and
a large brass pot on mantel shelf.
Table laid for meal often some time before meal ;
e.g. on my
arrival at 5.30 p.m. the laid dinner table was conspicuous in the
firelight, through the always open door to the hall.
Most conspicuous and distinctive object in room is a large Cairene
screen, of which I am particularly fond. It has the regular Egyptian
pattern work in dark wood.
On Thurs., Mar. 15, there were 3 ladies in the house: Mrs.
[Forbes] never wears colours ; Mrs. W. is a widow ; Miss H. L. in
brown tweed, brown shoes and stockings, a conspicuously brown
dress, which suits her striking colouring.
Coffee making an elaborate affair, very, but no machine in the
dining room.
Much silver on table, but no urn. On Thurs. morning, large tea
pot, large coffee pot, and silver pot with flowers. 4 silver candle-
sticks in the evening.
No green-handled knives.
Honeycomb always, and always cut with a knife, not a spoon.
Three large oriental china jars on cabinet, the centre one with a
very conspicuous tree on it.
Note. On Thurs. 15th, I only reached here at 5.30 p.m., so the
impression on [Mrs. Holland] was not by direct telepathy from me.
I had not seen the brown lady before this visit, and the oriental
china was no part of my conscious recollection. The Cairene screen
was familiar, though I had not thought of it before coming here.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 331
The house was known to Mr. Myers, and to Dr. Hodgson. The
address had not been given to [Mrs. Holland].
I knew that Mrs. Verrall was going to Mrs. Forbes's house
on that day, but I have never seen the house myself, nor
heard it described. Mrs. Forbes sent me the following con-
firmation :
April 8th, 1906.
Mrs. Verrall arrived on Thursday, March 15th, at about 5.45 p.m.
I am not quite sure that she did not catch the earlier train, but I
think not. The dining room here is a long room, but not a narrow
or a low one. The walls are papered with a rather dark crimson
paper and all the wood work and furniture is dark brown, wood
stained, no paint. Under the large windows is high wainscotting,
as high as an ordinary dado, and the effect of the room is red above,
brown below. The fireplace is a very large one with an old brass
fender and a brass arrangement for keeping plates hot. Above is
an oak shelf with a large brass ewer upon it, and above again,
against the frieze, are two large round brass dishes. The table
is left laid, with flowers and silver upon it, all day. There is usually
a bright fire in a large brass grate with dogs. The room is so large
that it is divided by an Egyptian screen, brought from Egypt by a
friend. There is some blue and white Indian china, with trees upon
it. A friend, dressed in brown, was staying in the house. At
breakfast there was honey, in the comb, on the table.
The wrong things in this description are :
\. The narrowness of the room.
2. Coffee machine and silver urn.
3. Greemhandled knives.
There was a good deal of silver on the table, but no urn.
N.B.—We had breakfasted at a little after eight, and no doubt
spoke of Mrs. Verrall coming that day.
No information was given to Mrs. Holland as to the
correctness either of this impression or of her script written
during the period of Mrs. Verrall's visit to Mrs. Forbes until
considerably later. It will be seen that a good many veridical
statements were made in it during this time, and it may be
conjectured that the association between Mrs. Verrall and Mrs.
Forbes created a specially favourable condition for telepathic
communication. But it must not be overlooked that the same
association gives Mrs. Holland's script a double chance of scoring
332 Alice Johnson. [part
successes, since her statements might be taken to refer either to
Mrs. Verrall or to Mrs. Forbes—possibly also to other visitors
staying in the house—and a certain degree of ambiguity is
thus introduced.
Mrs. Holland's first script written while holding Mrs. Verrall's
ring was as follows
:
(March 17th, 1906. 11 p.m.)
(1) It dates from more than twenty years ago.
(a) What a deep shade that great tree casts—it would shelter a
party of conspirators Once it did
—
In the little wood—the grave is there—All ground is consecrated
under God's sky
—
Her father loved her dearly but he did not always understand and
she was only a child when her mother died— She was very different
from the others
—
(2) The heart has no age—and she was always old for her years
—
so why notice any disparity —they never felt it.
(1) One of the first among the wedding gifts.
Sincerity and singleness of purpose are the keynotes
—
(3) It was the illness nearly 11 years ago that mattered most
A life that leads harmonious days
A straight bar brooch set with small stones— The lost one was
the shape of a tiny buckle set with seed pearls—that was on the
river bank— We are not met [sic] to keep our trifling possessions
all our lives long—we should enjoy them for the sake of their tender
associations or their own intrinsic beauty for a term of years or
months and then pass on the pleasure of them to a new owner—
Never regret a lost jewel—it has fulfilled its part in your life —let
it pass on
—
(b) The masculine reasoning is enlivened and alleviated by such
flashes of purely illogical feminine intuition that it robs her intellect
of half its terrors and supplies her greatest charm—consistent clever-
ness is so alienating
(4) "A young maid, with the bluest eyes." 1
(a) The tree here described was identified later as an old
yew tree with branches coming down to the ground at Whit-
tingehame, Mr. A. J. Balfour's Scotch estate. Mrs. Holland had
met Mr. Balfour while she was staying in London a few weeks
before this, and there were several references to him in the
1
R. Browning, Colombe's Birthday, Act I.
LV.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 333
script afterwards, but nothing more of an interesting or eviden-
tial character. The tree in question is close to a little wood,
which contains the grave in which Lady Blanche Balfour and
her son, Mr. F. M. Balfour, are buried. In a short Life of
Lady Blanche (by Dr. James Bobertson, published in 1897),1
which contains a picture of the grave, showing that it is among
trees, the place is described as " an ancient churchyard," but
there are now no indications of this. No mention is made in
the Life of the old yew tree. Lady Blanche was twelve years
old when her mother died.
A few weeks later Mrs. Holland, knowing nothing of the
verification of these points in her script, met Mr. Balfour again,
and on this occasion it happened that she was asked to try
some experiments in crystal-gazing. When Mr. Balfour held
the crystal she saw (as she tells me in a note written the
same evening)
the figure of a bishop, then a big dark overshadowing tree, but not
very clearly. . . . Mr. B. asked if the tree was dark or light. I
said " The picture has gone vague, but I have a funny impression
of conspiracy, but how can one connect the Gunpowder Plot with a
tree T" Mr. B. [said], " You are thinking of a real tree, but not
the one I was thinking of," and it turned out that he was thinking of
a tulip tree in England, while [two of his friends who were looking
on] thought of an old yew tree at Whittingehame, where the plot
to blow up Darnley is supposed to have been discussed.
Sir Oliver Lodge, who was also present, sends me a note in
confirmation of this account. Mrs. Holland believed that she
had never heard of this tree before, but Mrs. Sidgwick tells
me that the tree and the tradition about it are well-known in
the neighbourhood and mentioned in guide-books, so that this,
like many other incidents in Mrs. Holland's script, may possibly
be due to a subliminal recollection.
(b) It is hardly necessary to say that this description is
obviously meant to apply to Mrs. Verrall.
On the points in the script marked by numbers in brackets,
Mrs. Verrall informed me
:
(1) This seems to apply to her ring, lent to Mrs. Holland.
It had been sent in its original case, marked with her initials
1
This Life is practically a reprint of two articles in Good Words for April
and May, 1896.
334 Alice Johnson. [part
" M. de Gr." The initial of the surname was absent, because
the ring had been given to her on her last birthday before
her marriage—partly as a birthday and partly as a wedding
present. It was therefore true that it was " one of the first
among the wedding gifts," but this might perhaps have been
inferred from the absence of the last initial,—from which
again might follow the approximate date, " more than twenty
years ago."
(4) This may refer to Miss Verrall, who, her mother tells
me, was remarkable as a child for her blue eyes, so much so
that she used to be called the " blue-eyed maid " in her family
circle.
(2) and (3) may be taken to refer to Mr. and Mrs. Forbes,
between whom there is fourteen years' difference in age. Mr.
Forbes had a serious illness at the end of 1896 and the
greater part of 1897. "This illness (Mrs. Forbes wrote to
me) changed our lives completely." He had an earlier illness
not long after their marriage, from which he made a complete
recovery. This perhaps explains the use of the word " most
"
in the script.
Cross-Correspondence.
Posilipo.
The next day of experiment was March 21st, 1906, when
Mrs. Verrall wrote the following
:
(March 21, 1906. 11 p.m.)
(1) overland route arrival next month. Massiliotes terragenae
and bright the last gleams of the lingering sun, o'er olives old
and hoary.
(2) Posilippo [sic] and a terrace there—blue sea beyond the marble
balustrade.
No I can see no more here. But say Goodnight.
You could meet Mrs. [Holland] in April before Easter I think
—
and she conies to you later in the spring.
On this script Mrs. Verrall sent me the following notes
:
April 1st, 1906.
(1) Terrigenae (earth-born) means indigenous inhabitants. Mas-
saliotes is the Greek word for natives of Massalia (Marseilles).
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 335
(2) Posilipo near Naples is the site of Virgil's tomb : it is on a
hill called from a villa. It is covered with remains of Roman
villas and has many " points of view " including openings in a long
tunnel through which the road runs. There are views from an inn
and a terrace, but I can find no " marble balustrade." This infor-
mation comes from a guide book and is new to me.
I know Marseilles, but not Naples etc.
Both these topics, (1) and (2), had a certain relevance to
Mrs. Holland.
(1) I sent a copy of the script (all but the last sentence
in which she is referred to) to her on March 24th, and
she wrote to me on March 29th:
Is " Massiliotes " a shot at Marseilles 1 My father starts from
there next month to go to Sicily and Greece and other lovely
places, where he will doubtless see " olives old and hoary " and
"blue sea."
(2) As shown below, the first sentence of Mrs. Holland's
script of March 21st, 1906, written at 10.10 p.m., is:
They have all been trying in turn but some of them are not
serious— Margaret and Helen are— M. saw a real place that
last time but she has never seen the place itself and did not
describe it very clearly.
Mrs. Verrall had mentioned to Mrs. Holland when they met
on Nov. 16th, 1905, that she had a daughter Helen, and I
think some reference was made to experiments with her. Her
daughter was not with her during her visit to Mrs. Forbes, but
she did a good deal of experimenting with Mrs. Forbes and
one or two ladies who were staying in the house in planchette
writing, crystal-gazing, etc. The phrase " M. saw a real place
that last time but she has never seen the place itself" is true
if applied to Mrs. Verrall's script about Posilipo just quoted.
I now quote Mrs. Holland's script for this day produced
while she was wearing Mrs. Verrall's ring
:
(Wed. March 21st, 1906. 10.10 p.m.)

(b) The boat race was won by Cambridge on April 7th,
1906.
The names " Percival " and "Edgar" have not been dis-
covered to have any meaning in connection with the rest of
the script.
(c) probably refers to Mrs. Verrall, who, as Mrs. Holland
knew, had been for some time suffering from some form of
neuritis and had been forbidden to write. This latter fact is
symbolised, I take it, in the drawings of the goose and
ink-stand with a quill in it.
338 Alice Johnson. [part
About the veridical statements in the script, marked with
numbers in brackets, Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Forbes gave me the
following information :
(1) The cross-correspondence involved in this has just been
described, see above, pp. 334-5.
(2) There are two windows in Mrs. Forbes's drawing-room,
one a large bow, the other a small window, both looking south
into the garden. There is a stream in the garden which can
be seen from one of these windows. It was in this room
that Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Forbes did planchette writing-
together.
(3) Mrs. Forbes writes (April 8th, 1906): "There is honey-
suckle outside the window on the house, and there was a
Pyrus Japonica, but all except a small shoot has died. No
Passion flower."
(4) " Frank " is Mr. Forbes's name, but there seems to be
no point in the statement that he paid a heavy price, nor is
there any association of the name Daisy with him.
(5) On the day when this script was written, March 21st,
Mrs. Verrall and Miss H. L. (the " brown lady " of Mrs.
Holland's impression, see above, p. 329) were trying experiments
in crystal-gazing, when Mrs. Verrall asked Mrs. Forbes if she
possessed an inlaid musket, as one had been described in her
script of August 26th, 1903.1
Mrs. Forbes said she had an
inlaid weapon of another kind -and brought it in from the hall
to show her. It turned out to be a dagger, nine or ten
inches long, part of which was much worn.
(6) Mrs. Verrall suggested that this might refer to a dog
belonging to Mrs. Forbes with whom they used to play at
hiding things in the room for him to find.
(7) "F." may mean Frank (Mr. Forbes). The drawing that
follows is apparently intended for a horoscope, containing the
1
This script contains a drawing of the Gurwood crest, repeated in Mrs.
Verrall's script of -
Nov. 23rd, 1903 (for comments on which see her Report,
p. 263) and also a drawing of a gun, followed by the words :
" the handle is
inlaid with mother of pearl, it is a foreign made gun—used in the place described
above —for big game. It is long ago now but the gun is kept somewhere, hung
over a hall fireplace—stock lock and barrel. You have not been into the house
but you may go and will recognise this when you see it. It was used in 1780
or that date is somewhere near the gun. There is a big hearth below and
blue tiles."

sign of Cancer (incorrectly drawn) and the symbols of Venus
(upside down), the Sun and the Moon. The figure under
Cancer may be meant for the aspect of Opposition, or possibly
Venus again. In the next drawing the triangle and square
probably denote two of the aspects, Trine and Quartile, the
divided circle being perhaps the beginning of a second attempt
to draw a horoscope.
Mrs. Forbes tells me that Mr. Forbes used to be much
interested in drawing nativities, but she thinks the last one
he drew was her own, about thirty years ago, before their
marriage. She suggests that the Moon, which is specially
conspicuous in Mrs. Holland's horoscope, is perhaps meant to
symbolise her Christian name, Diana.
Mrs. Holland's script of March 28th, 1906, begins with the
passage about Eoden Noel, quoted above, p. 324, then
goes on
:
" A new dress not a black one this time. A coral charm
—
handshaped." Then after some references to Mrs. Sidgwick
and her family, it ends with a reference to Fawcett (see below,
p. 343).
Mrs. Verrall notes on this (April 10th, 1906):
Some time ago, I think on Feb. 2nd, I called on my dressmaker
to arrange for an evening dress, which I intended should be black.
She, however, insisted on a colour, and I eventually agreed. About
March 11th I appointed March 31st to be fitted, and on March 31st
was fitted for the dress in question.
In a letter dated March 29th, 1906, enclosing this script,
Mrs. Holland wrote :
Before I fell asleep last night, I saw an absolute procession of faces,
small and clear like crystal visions. ... A clean-shaven elderly
clergyman face was the best of the number ; a thin, pale youth, like
a plainer, sturdier Keats, the most interesting.
On this night Mrs. Verrall was staying at the house of
a clergyman friend (Mr. M. A. Bayfield) answering to
this first description, which, however, might apply to many
persons.
340 Alice Johnson. [PART
On the same night, Mrs. Verrall wrote as follows :
(March 28th, 1906. 11 p.m.)
She has quite another gift—Divine Remembrance not Vision
—
You forget what we tell you— There was something for you to
write but it comes not. It should have been recorded three days
ago. There is a picture of a boy about thirteen or less a slim
figure in blue alone with no one else in the picture, a portrait, there
is a dog with him. It hangs on the right of the wall as you look.
Brown curls and a round head a full length portrait. Ask about
that. The other boy has a pony but he did not ride, this one I
mean.
But I have not made her understand.
I sent a copy of this to Mrs. Holland, and she wrote to
me on April 5th, 1906 :
The "picture of a boy" referred to in the script of March 28th
is just like the portrait of Uncle Rupert described in The Story of a
Short Life by Mrs. Ewing. I had been reading this story and
thinking over it exactly three days before the 28th, because I was
choosing some books —delights of my own youth—to give to a friend's
little daughter, and wondered if this one was too unbearably pathetic
for a sensitive child.
Mrs. Holland told me later (May 28th, 1906) that she
thought " the other boy [who] has a pony " was the hero of
another of Mrs. Ewing's stories, Jaekancqoes, which she had
been reading on the same occasion.
On looking at these two books, I found that the picture of
" Uncle Rupert " is described as a painting by Vandyck of a
youth of sixteen, a young cavalier, dressed in " pale-hued satin
"
with " falling hair," and with his hand resting on the head
of a dog. Since the boy is spoken of as " standing for his
portrait," this may be supposed to be full length, and it is
so represented by the artist who illustrates the book. " Uncle
Rupert " is an ancestor of the child hero of the story, who
" did not ride," as he was crippled by an accident at the age
of six, and died a few months later. The hero of the other
story, Jackanapes, had a pony, which figures prominently in
the book.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 341
Cross-Correspondence.
Fawcdt.
Mrs. Holland's script of Feb. 9th, 1906, begins:
The insurance should be claimed— No not in the New York Co.
the other — Fawcett—no
—
It goes on to write a conundrum for the name " Kichard
Hodgson" (see section on the Hodgson Control, p. 304) apparently
quite unconnected with the first sentence.
When Mrs. Verrall met Mrs. Holland in my room on
Feb. 21st (see p. 290) the whole of this script was dis-
cussed, and Mrs. "Verrall then mentioned that the name Fawcett
had significance for her. It was at this time that several
notorious failures of American Insurance companies were taking
place.
On Mrs. Verrall's side were the following references to
Fawcett :
On January 9th, 1904, her script referred to the name in
connection with a message forming part of a cross-correspondence
with Mrs. Forbes (for a full account of which see Mrs. Verrall's
Report, pp. 265-6), but the name did not appear in Mrs. Forbes's
script.
Mrs. Verrall had some relatives of this name ; a Mr.
William Fawcett was first cousin to her mother, and the
" Carrie or Caroline " mentioned in two sittings of Mrs.
Verrall's with Mrs. Piper, November 25th and 27th, 1889,
was identified by Mrs. Verrall as his wife. In the report of
these sittings (see Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VI. pp. 584-89)
the name Fawcett is not mentioned at all, only the Christian
names being given.
On March 20th, 1906, Mrs. Verrall was trying planchette
writing with Mrs. Forbes, and gives me the following account
of it, written from notes made at the time
:
Reference was made first to people called Hill [the name of some
acquaintances of Mrs. Forbes], then :
" Would it make you happy to
have more evidence. Edward. Edward Hill will make it clear."
Then other statements and after an interval: "Better be quick, as
Y
342 Alice Johnson. [part
we have more to say. Open the last morning's paper and look for
the lost word."
(Question: What part of paper 1)
" Marriages and deaths. Hill who writes was well known to Hill
who died. Will you try to find my lost name in the column.
Edward was wrong. Over the column is my lost name."
We decided that the " last morning's paper " must mean the
morning paper most recently arrived and there heing no other paper
in the house we fetched [the local paper] of March 20th from the
dining-room. Neither of us had seen it. The first name in the
Births, Marriages, Deaths column was Fawcett. 1
I then remembered that William Fawcett's two maternal uncles
were called Hill and Edmund, and thought these were perhaps
intended by "Edward Hill, Edward wrong." I told Mrs. Forbes
that the name " Fawcett " had been connected with me by [Mrs.
Holland]. (I referred to the occurrence of the name in her script
discussed by Miss Johnson and myself on Feb. 21st, 1906, when I
told her the name had a meaning for me.) Planchette then wrote :
" Ask [Mrs. Holland] to give my lost name. She must be asked.
Send what I write to her."
When I wrote out the incident [the same evening] I remembered
that there had been a previous attempt [in my script of Jan. 9th,
1904] to connect Fawcett with Mrs. Forbes, which had been unsuc-
cessful. I had been reminded of that incident on March 19th, but
had not mentioned it to Mrs. Forbes.
If we suppose an attempt on Jan. 9th, 1904, to convey the name
Fawcett to Mrs. Forbes, it is not inappropriate, since the attempt
failed, to describe the name as lost.
There seems no possibility that either Mrs. Forbes or I was
normally aware that the name Fawcett headed the announcement
column of the local paper. We ascertained that the announcement
was not in the Times nor in the local paper of Monday, March 19th.
Neither of us knows the Fawcetts in question.
Mrs. Verrall did not, as suggested by Planchette, send
any information about her script to Mrs. Holland, but sent
me a brief summary of the above incident on March 22nd,
1906, so that I might be on the look-out for the name
Fawcett.
1
Mrs. Verrall sent me part of the paper to show this. The part she
sent contained the title and date and the greater part of the column
referred to.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 343
On March 28th, 1906, Mrs. Holland's script ends with
this passage
:
This script was written when Mrs. Holland was staying
with some friends near Salisbury, and I noticed that the letter
enclosing it was written on a sheet of paper with a crest
closely resembling the drawing after " Maida," and with the
address ending in " Salisbury " impressed on it. This drawing
suggested that the heading of the paper had been strongly
impressed on her subliminal consciousness, and it may be
surmised that the name " Salisbury " had evoked the idea of
Henry Fawcett, who was so closely associated with the place.
That Henry Fawcett is intended is shown clearly by the
reference to blindness.
"Feb. 28th—no, earlier" seems to mean that he has been
mentioned before, at some date earlier than Feb. 28th, and
this might refer to the " Fawcett " mentioned in Mrs. Holland's
script of Feb. 9th, 1906, quoted above, p. 341.
On March 31st Mrs. Verrall came to see me, and I dis-
cussed with her some of Mrs. Holland's recent script. We
then referred to the script of Feb. 28th (quoted above, p. 291)
to see if there was any apparent connection with Fawcett in
it. It contained the following passage
:
It was first started when we were all sitting under the cedars at
Broadlands. While the sunset flared crimson on that noble window.
In Mrs. Holland's script, Broadlands (the house of the late
Lord Mount-Temple) is generally associated with Mr. Myers,
and has been several times referred to above. It is also the
fact, however, that Lord Mount-Temple was a friend of Mr.
Fawcett's and associated with him politically, especially in
his work for the preservation of commons and open spaces.
He also used to fish in the Itchen at Broadlands.1
Henry F, darkened windows then.
Feb. 28 th no earlier.
These facts are given in the Life of Henry Fawcett, by Leslie Stephen.
344 Alice Johnson, [part
Further, Mrs. Verrall wrote to me on April 1st, 1906, that
her cousin, Mrs. Fawcett, above mentioned, once stayed at
Broadlands on a special occasion, and she tells me that the
name Broadlands is in her mind associated mainly, if not
solely, with this visit of her cousin's to it.
Mrs. Holland's next reference to Fawcett is on April 4th,
No further losses

F. a blue jewel—set in a ring —or else in a brooch— Tell
Margaret not to lose another earring—the hearthrug-
Here Fawcett, the blind Postmaster General, is clearly
indicated by the dark spectacles, the letter and the whip,
—
the whip being perhaps an allusion to the fact that, though
blind, he hunted.
" isTo further losses " seems a reference to the Insurance Co.
mentioned on Feb. 9 th.
" The bench under the cedars " seems another reference to
Broadlands.
" F. a blue jewel etc." Mrs. Verrall wrote to me on
April 10th, 1906: " F. is the initial of my sister's name
[Mrs. Verrall's only sister] and she has a blue jewel in a
brooch which came to her from a Fawcett." This brooch
belonged to Mrs. W. Fawcett.
Thus the script seems to contain again allusions to the
two quite distinct Fawcetts, Henry Fawcett and Mrs. Verrall's
connections of the same name.
In answer to questions on the subject, Mrs. Holland told
me that neither she nor any of her family had known Mr.
lv\] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 345
Henry Fawcett. She has connections living in Wiltshire, with
whom she often stays, but they did not go to live there till
1894, whereas he died in 1884.
Experiments with Mrs. Forbes on the Supposed Influence
of Inanimate Objects.
On March 29th, 1906, Mrs. Forbes happened to be in
London and came to see me, and we discussed the passages
in Mrs. Holland's script that seemed to have reference to her.
She suggested that I should send Mrs. Holland a glove of hers,
on the chance that this might facilitate messages, and left
with me for the purpose one of the gloves that she was then
wearing.
I sent the glove to Mrs. Holland, saying merely that a
friend of mine had asked me to send her a glove with the
request that she would try two or three times to get script
or crystal visions with it. I did not of course mention any
name, and there could have been nothing whatever to suggest
that the glove came from the lady with whom Mrs. Verrall
had just been staying,—especially as I had followed my usual
custom of making no comment to Mrs. Holland on the correct-
ness or otherwise of her recent script.
With this glove Mrs. Holland tried several experiments on
March 31st and April 1st, and recorded both crystal-visions
and impressions obtained in connection with it, as well as
script, as follows
:
(Sat. March 31st, 1906. 10.25 p.m.)
Script.
(1) A tall leafless tree stands on the lawn— You see it so well
from what used to be my window.
A purple cross—strangely shaped—of amethysts I think
—
(2) The rings have grown too large for her slender fingers.
Ferns border the path—and the branches meet overhead

Gertrude was near us but not with us.

Crystal Visions.
Moonlight on a grey street —a red curtained window on the first
floor has a light shining through it.
(6) A small statuette —not at all clear-—of a woman with outstretched
arms—a Madonna I think.
A nun's face—kind and good—no longer young
—
(7) A rocky shore—one cliff overhangs very curiously
—
(None of these were very clear and they were all fleeting.)
Impressions.
The outside of a house—with a small old fashioned verandah and
long windows that open on the garden. A great white jasmine in
full flower climbs to the first floor windows.
I see a passage, but the doors are fast closed ; two doors on the
right, one on the left ; a step down, matting.
An old fashioned clock—some china behind glass doors.
I feel discontent ; a past sorrow still throws its shadow, but dis-
content is nearer.

Impressions.
(10) A curious' triangular shape, of yellowish metal with bosses
like rough jewels on the points. It looks very old and its meaning
puzzles me.
A circular ruin—like the remains of a tower ;
something in the

no, not a human skull ; but bones of some kind. The ruin
is near the sea.
A circle of light that sparkles and spins.
A little path glimmers white in a dark wood.
(11) Violets, a clump of wild violets. Green grass.
On this Mrs. Forbes sent me the following notes, dated
April 8th, 1906 :
(1) There are many trees round [my] house but no solitary one.
(2) "The rings" and "slender fingers" were obvious from the
[appearance of the] glove.
(3) [There is a greenhouse opening into Mrs. Forbes's drawing-
room.—A. J.]
(4) I hear the noise of the stream here at night when I lean
from my window.
(5) A quotation which I have known since I was 20 and "felt
with " very strongly.
(6) A statuette stands on my writing-table, —a great favourite,
—
Victory, with outstretched arms.
(7) This is a frequent vision of my own (not in a crystal, —
a
mental picture).
(8) I took a little bronze statuette of Washington (not Lincoln)
to be mended, so it was missing from its place.
(9) The associations of these sentences [down to the end of the
script] are appropriate and vivid, but not evidential, as the only
name, "George," is wrong. I think it would be useless to discuss
them, as they might apply to any one who had had sorrow in a
life as long as mine.
[I may add that Mrs. Forbes, as readers of Mrs. VerralPs Report
will be aware, lost her only son in the South African War, and
most of her automatic writing referred to in Mrs. Verrall's Report
purports to be inspired by him. It is therefore specially appropriate
348 Alice Johnson. [part
to speak of the strength of " the influence that comes down, comes
back." Much evidential matter has been contained in this writing.

A. J.]
(10) I do not recognise the triangular jewel or the circular ruin. 1
(11) The violets are a great feature of this place, wild and
cultivated.
From April 12th to 19th, 1906, Mrs. Holland was staying
at the house of some friends of hers, where Sir Oliver Lodge
happened also to be staying. This was the first time that
she had met him. Sir Oliver Lodge had heard from me of
her script, and now had some talk with her about it. He
also showed her some of the proofs of Mrs. Yerrall's Eeport
on her own script, most of which was then in print, though
not published till October, 1906. (It was from Mrs. Holland
herself that I heard of her having seen these proofs. Sir
Oliver Lodge had forgotten to tell me.)
From this date onwards, therefore, it has to be assumed
that everything mentioned in Mrs. Verrall's Eeport may
possibly be within Mrs. Holland's normal knowledge. A long
section of this Eeport (Chapter XL pp. 219-275) is concerned
with the cross-correspondences between the scripts of Mrs.
Verrall and Mrs. Forbes, and although I told Mrs. Holland
nothing about the owner of the objects I next sent to her
(see below) it seems not impossible that she may have guessed
subliminally that they had belonged to Talbot Forbes, though
supraliminally she made another guess.
I will now give in full the script of this period which seems
to relate to Mrs. Forbes, explaining later what details in it
might have been derived from Mrs. Verrall's Eeport.
As just mentioned, the script Mrs. Holland had produced on
March 31st and April 1st in connection with Mrs. Forbes's
glove had been correct in several particulars, and Mrs. Forbes,
wishing to continue the experiments, decided to send Mrs.
Holland (through me) something that had belonged to her son.
After considering for a little time what to select, she sent me
on May 17th, 1906, a glove of his and a Japanese bronze bird
which he had kept on his mantelpiece at school. The glove,
1
Mrs. Holland tells me that she now (April, 1908) traces the triangular shape,
circular ruin, and skull, to an essay on Magic by Mr. W. B. Yeats in a book she
had been rt ading just at that time.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 34i>
as I noted before sending it on, was a grey suede with black
stripes on the back, marked " Made in France ;
" obviously
a man's glove, which had been worn probably not more than
a few times and had some little spots on it, as gloves do
that have been lying by for some time. It had no name or
initials on it, and I looked carefully over it to see if any
other indications were given, but could find none. I sent it
and the bird to Mrs. Holland on May 18th, 1906, with this
letter
:
... I wonder if you would mind trying another experiment of
the kind I asked you to do a little while ago. These two objects
also come from a friend of mine who has heard something about
your script and would be very glad if you would try what writing
you can get with them. I think it might be worth trying two or
three times. Would you mind bringing back the bird with you on
May 28th [when Mrs. Holland had arranged to come and see me
in London]. The owner says it is not necessary to return the glove.
The expressions used in this letter were chosen to avoid
suggesting to Mrs. Holland that the objects came from the
same person as the owner of the glove sent before, and as a
matter of fact she guessed that they came from Mr. Feilding,
and had some connection with Mr. Myers, as explained below.
Meanwhile, a piece of script written by Mrs. Holland on
May 15th, 1906,—i.e. two days before Mrs. Forbes sent the
objects, but during the time that she was thinking of what
to select,—contains a description of a man whom Mrs. Verrall,
on being told of it, thought she recognised and whom she
later identified as Mr. Forbes. The description is as follows :
(May 15th. 10.15 p.m.)
Better take foreign paper since I come from so far away — He
is sitting in the arm chair—the big leather one—that is so comfortable
and so old — It was red once but it has faded to a friendly
familiar brown— His right hand is holding his left ankle—inelegant
but characteristic. Very thin but it's a big frame—Grey hair that
wants cutting— His eyes have a trick of half shutting when he
talks earnestly— Eye glasses probably mislaid as usual. He never
erred on the side of foppery in dress he might be neater without
harm—that shape of collar was always all his own-— "What do
appearances matter save to establish identity.
350 Alice Johnson. [part
Can you imagine him happy without hooks ?

[After this comes a passage ahout wireless telegraphy, a topic
often referred to in the script, followed by :]

Mrs. Holland tells me that these last words mean :
" Oh
thou jewel in the lotus, thou !
" and that the drawing that
follows is a rough attempt to depict the seed-vessel of the lotus,
a frequent ornament in Buddhist carving. "The 'jewel in the
lotus ' (she says) symbolises purity as well as heavenly wisdom,
and is sometimes rendered as the '
the heart of the lily.'
"
As to the description of the man, Mrs. Verrall wrote to
me on June 1st, 1906 :
[Mr. Forbes] is a tall man, not stout, with large frame, on which
his clothes hang rather loosely. He is grey. He almost closes his
eyes when he speaks. He has a habit of leaning back in his low
chair, with the left leg crossed over the right, and places his finger
tips together, and I have certainly seen him hold his left ankle in
his right hand. He has a habit of rocking slightly to and fro when
amused.
I can't remember details of [Mrs. Holland's] description, but, as I
told you, the man seemed familiar and I suddenly remembered of
whom I was reminded.
Mrs. Forbes, to whom I sent the script later, wrote to me
on July 4th, 1906 :
1
Christina Rossetti.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 351
"The big arm chair." [Mr. Forbes's] chair is one he had made at
Cambridge 40 years ago, and is, he says, the most comfortable chair he
knows. It is covered with red leather, shabby in places, but not
actually brown. I do not think the attitude very characteristic, but
the thinness and the hair are specially characteristic, and he has a
habit of almost shutting one eye when he looks carefully at anything.
The "dress" and "collar" bits are specially good. He has collars
made for him—turned down collars, lower than is usual. He has
many books and loves them.
In answer to further questions, Mrs. Forbes wrote to me again:
July 7th, 1906.
The eye-glasses have no meaning for [Mr. Forbes]. He has never
worn any, but he is very short-sighted and often loses things and
has to search his pockets. . . . My son used eye glasses always. . . .
As to the later points in the same script, " Talbot " is the
name of Mrs. Forbes's son. (The real name was given in the
script, for which I have substituted the pseudonym used in
Mrs. Verrall's Ile])ort.)
" Fowey. The Duchey "
—no doubt the Duchy of Cornwall,
Fowey being in Cornwall, which is referred to in the earlier
script in connection with lioden Noel. There is a poem of his
entitled Foxvey. This seems entirely unconnected with all the
rest of the script.
" Isis " (Mrs. Forbes writes) " might be the association with
the Thames, which was strong, unbroken, all Talbot's life."
The lily, she tells me, is on the shield of his school, and
" Blessed are the pure in heart " is written on the stone over
his grave. The lotus flower is stamped on all his Tutor's books
given as prizes, and is also stamped in gold on a picture of
Sir Galahad given to him by his Tutor. This lotus has nothing
to do with the school arms, which consist of three large lilies,
surmounted by a fleur de lys and a leopard.
The next script to be cpaoted in this connection is dated
May 22nd, 1906. In the letter enclosing it and acknowledging
the bird and glove, Mrs. Holland wrote
:
My impression on touching them before I read your note was that
the glove had belonged to a man dead some years ago, and that the
bird had been a paper-weight he had used. I have been waiting for
these impressions to fade before I try any script.
352 Alice Johnson. [part
The script accordingly was written late at night. The idea
that the glove belonged to a dead man might, I think, have
been suggested by its appearance, since, as remarked above, it
looked as if it had been lying by for some time. The script
was as follows
:
(Tuesday. May 22nd, 1906. 11.45 p.m. —with glove and bird.)
But it should not have been cleaned
—
(a) It is the wiring—the electric lighting in the John St. house
that is dangerous— The terms of the fire insurance too need super-
vising— Denbigh.
(b) An old Roman wall—the pyramid is near
—
Here lyeth one whose name was writ in water
—
A scroll of crystal blazoning the name of Adonais.
(1) In my own room—where the deep green colour predominates
—
And a trifle becomes a relic
—
Col. ii 5.
What need to sorrow since our hope is certain
What need to languish though the night seem long
Stars are ablaze beyond Earth's misty curtain
Sorrow and silence shall have end in song
—
* * * * *
The first sentence, " But it should not have been cleaned,'*
no doubt refers to the glove.
(a) The passage about the electric wiring I took to refer
to Mr. Feilding, since he has a house in John Street and is
a son of the late Lord Denbigh and brother of the present
Earl. I therefore sent it to him for his comments. He
replied on May 24th, 1906:
For some time past I have been deluged with advertisements from
Messrs. Gillow as to the need of fire insurance policies getting
supervised. These have made some impression on my mind, and I
have put them aside with the intention of applying to them to
value, as they suggest is necessary. So far so good. But it is possible
that everybody else who is a householder has been similarly deluged.
I have had, I think, no less than four communications, and my
susceptible mind was so influenced that had the house not been let,
I should have succumbed to what is certainly very persuasive and
what appears to be very sensible advice.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 353
Nevertheless, in the interests of science, Mr. Feilding did
have the electric wiring at his house tested the next day, and
sent me the report of the electricians, which was as follows :
May 25th, 1906.
5 John St.
We have tested the electric wiring at above and find that there
are two defective circuits . . . There are leakages on these which
should be remedied as soon as convenient. . . . The other circuits
are very fair. ... It will be necessary to cut the wires referred to
as defective where jointed and test them from point to point to
ascertain where the defective parts are ... So far as it is possible
to ascertain the R.W. pipe is now sound, but it is not possible to
say how far the rust has penetrated.
Writing to Mrs. Holland later (Aug. 22nd, 1906) Mr.
Feilding says :
" I had the electric light system in my house
tested, with the result that a very serious leak, which might
have proved dangerous, was discovered. The rectification is
very obvious in the electric light bills since."
T saw Mrs. Holland on May 28th, 1906, when she was
spending a few days in London, and spent an afternoon
going over the whole of her script with her from the beginning.
Some time before we got to the date May 22nd, 1906, she
remarked that she had associated the man's glove with Mr.
Feilding and had imagined that both it and the bird were
somehow connected both with him and with Mr. Myers. She
did not seem to be at all aware that she had written anything
about either of them in connection with the glove. I told
her that Mr. Feilding had nothing to do with either object,
but that they were connected with Mr. Myers indirectly, at
a sort of second or third hand, the owner being associated
with the main group of controls {i.e. Mr. Myers and Mr.
Gurney). I was of course aware that since she had seen the
proofs of Mrs. Verrall's Eeport, this remark might lead her to
guess that it was Talbot Forbes (see Mrs. Verrall's Report, p. 220,
foot-note). I then told her of the verification of the statement
in her script about the electric wiring and questioned her
closely as to whether she could have heard of Mr. Feilding's
connection with John Street and Lord Denbigh. She told
me all she could remember of the occasion in February
1906, when she had met him at a dinner party in London
354 Alice Johnson. [part
(as mentioned above, p. 291). She was confident that she
had not heard either the address of his house or the name of
his brother. It seems possible, however, that these points
may have been casually mentioned on this occasion, overheard
by her,—consciously or subconsciously,—and afterwards for-
gotten. No weight therefore can be attached to their appear-
ance in the script, and it may even be supposed that Mrs.
Holland's guess that the glove was Mr. Feilding's evoked a
subliminal recollection of details she had heard about him.
Two days later I saw Mr. Feilding and asked what he
could remember of his meeting with Mrs. Holland on this
occasion. His account was substantially the same as hers,
except in one particular. She had told me that he had talked
to her about Mrs. Forbes's script, of which she had afterwards
read in the proofs of Mrs. Verrall's Report. I asked if he
had called her Mrs. Forbes, or given her real name (which
I did not mention). She replied that he had called her Mrs.
Forbes, and she supposed that was her real name. Now
I was practically certain that Mr. Feilding did not know
at that time that the pseudonym Forbes had been chosen,
and I thought it very unlikely in any case that he should
have mentioned the topic to Mrs. Holland. I asked him if
he had done so, and he said he was certain he had not, nor
did he then know of the pseudonym. It seemed clear there-
fore that his recollection was correct, and that Mrs. Holland
had first heard of Mrs. Forbes from Mrs. Verrall's proofs. This
is one of several occasions on which I have found that her
memory, like that of other people, is not always quite accurate.
As to the question whether she too had seen advertisements
of insurance agents and valuers such as had been sent to Mr.
Feildino1
, Mrs. Holland wrote to me later :
June 9fch, 1906.
About the script of May 22nd anent the John Street house, I had
not been seeing anything about electric lighting. We are off the
track of such advertisements here, where we burn only innocent oil
lamps. My only thoughts about fire insurance had been in connection
with the San Francisco disaster [i.e. the great earthquake] a month
before. I have, however, a deep distrust of electric wiring and a
special horror of fires since that big one at the Glen in Feb. 1905,
so there was a deeply worn channel in my mind ready to convey
LV.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 355
that message. That accounts perhaps for its unwonted coherence
and common sense.
(b) " An old Roman wall " etc. This obviously refers to
the Protestant cemetery at Rome, with the pyramid of Cestius
just outside the wall overshadowing the graves of Keats and
Shelley. " Here lyeth one whose name was writ in water
"
is the end of the inscription on Keats's grave (" lyeth " should
be " lies "), and the next line refers, of course, to Adonais,
Shelley's poem on Keats. There is a memorial tablet to Mr.
Myers in the same part of the cemetery.1
On the next passage in the script, marked (1), Mrs. Forbes
writes
:
(1) "In my own room." The small room in which I write is
papered with a deep green colour. In it I have collected all the
little possessions of my son. The bronze bird I sent came from
the chimney piece there, where many "trifles" lie, all now "relics."
Every night I lean out of the window and look at the stars before
I get into bed, so at 11.45 p.m. my thoughts would probably accord
with the lines, " What need to sorrow " etc., and the verse, Col. ii. 5.
This verse is :
" For though I be absent in the flesh, yet
am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order
and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ."
Mrs. Holland wrote again with the glove and bird on May
23rd, 1906. Most of this script seems to have no connection
at all with Mrs. Forbes, but at the end, with an abrupt and
marked change of hand-writing into one closely resembling
Mrs. Holland's normal hand, come the phrases :
The Winged Victory.
Lime blossoms wait for June
—
The sleepy bird has waked its way.
The mention of " the sleepy bird " seems to indicate that
this passage refers to its owner. (The bird had its head turned
round and lying back, as if asleep.) Mrs. Forbes told me
that she had given the " Winged Victory " of Pompeii to the
chapel of her son's school, as a memorial of him. This was a
reproduction of the same Victory as that mentioned in connection
with Mrs. Holland's crystal- vision marked (6) on March 31st
1
This is the first of many references to this cemetery in Mrs. Holland's script.
356 Alice Johnson. [part
{see p. 346). Mrs. Forbes's own statuette is exactly as the
statue was found, with one arm missing. For the chapel the
missing arm was restored and is stretched out, the hand
holding a wreath. " June " is appropriate in this connection,
as the yearly festivity of the school is in June, and the " sleepy
bird " was a school possession of Talbot Forbes, so that all the
phrases quoted show a possible connection with his school.
The next script was produced on May 30th, 1906. It
was not written with the glove and bird, but Mrs. Forbes (to
whom I sent a copy of all the script of this period in case
she should see significance in any of it) thought it suggestive
of some connection with her son, the initial of whose Christian
name was given in it. Here again, it is only the last part
of the script, again marked by a difference in the hand-
writing, that she thought significant. It is as follows
:
Only the plainest truth will be of any help.
The bat's Wing.
Not now. [T.] ]

The real initial of Mrs. Forbes's son, called in this paper "Talbot," is given

lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 357
On this Mrs. Forbes comments
:
July 4th, 1906.
[T.] looks like a boy's initial. The double wine-glass or hour-
glass suggests to me a favourite trick, —two wine glasses, one of water,
one of wine, the contents of which change places. The pot has also
an association for me, and the butterfly is a thing [Talbot] would
choose as a sign, for we made a collection together and he was very
much interested in Entomology. The butterfly cabinet is in the
room spoken of above, and also a sofa on which [Talbot's] dog always
slept at night. Altogether the [T.] and the illustrations are very
suggestive to me.
Mrs. Forbes adds later
:
The wine-glass trick was one that used to interest [Talbot], but
I was the performer. There is a photograph of a flower in a
brass pot, rather like the drawing, which was taken by my son
when we first started photography. It was a success, so he was
rather pleased with it, and it is something he would know I
should remember. Also we had a puppy which he very often
photographed at the same time. It was a great favourite and
his own possession ; it always slept on a big sofa. He was making
a collection of butterflies and moths and spent much time over it.
The pot and the butterfly and the puppy are as distinctive of
the holidays at this house as the three lines above are of the
school.
Finally some possible references occur in a passage in some
script written on June 25th, 1906, Mrs. Holland being then
on board ship on her way back to India. She had before
going returned to me the bronze bird, but at my request had
kept the glove, though, as far as I know, she did not use it
in connection with this or any subsequent script. This script
was written in response to a special impulse on a Monday, that
is, not on the regular day—Wednesday—fixed for simultaneous
writing with Mrs. Verrall. The passage I quote is in the
hand-writing of the Gurney control, except for the two con-
cluding lines of verse :
But the normal reaction was lacking.
"Semper fidelis"
Not on the ring but in the shield.
z
358 Alice Johnson. [part
Poor little dog—she was grieved about it and no wonder. G.
Beyond the lawn the lilies hold their sway
Unshadowed by the rose of yesterday.
As already stated, some of Mrs. Forbes's script purports to
be from Mr. Gurney. She writes of the above (July 4th,
1906):
"Poor little dog." [Talbot's] dog died early in the year; it was a
grief to us.
" Beyond the lawn ..." I have had the lilies moved and put
into a long bed in the rose garden. You approach them by the
tennis lawn.
It will be seen that the grounds for connecting this last
passage with Mrs. Forbes are but slight, while the connection
is not certain in some of the previous cases.
We have now to consider how many of the statements
apparently connected with Mrs. Forbes, in the part of Mrs.
Holland's script which was produced after she had seen the
proofs of Mrs. Verrall's report, might have been derived from
her recollections—supraliminal or subliminal—of the report.
The following topics occur both in the script and in the
Keport
:
(1) Mrs. Holland's script of May 15th gives a description
of a man, identified as Mr. Forbes by Mrs. Verrall and Mrs.
Forbes. The only reference to Mr. Forbes in Mrs. Verrall's
Beport is on p. 267, as follows: "A letter from Mr. Forbes
to her at Cranford will go this month."
(2) Mrs. Holland's script of May 15th gives the real
Christian name of Mrs. Forbes's son. He is called Talbot
in Mrs. Verrall's Beport, but I think I recollect that in one
part of the proof the real name was printed by mistake, and
of course corrected before publication.
(3) Mrs. Holland's script of May 16th contains the phrase
" Ask Clara Forbes about the wreck." There is, as far as I
know, no significance in this in connection with Mrs. Forbes,
but I regard it as a mis-recollection of her Christian name
Diana, mentioned in Mrs. Verrall's Beport, p. 222.
(4) On June 25th Mrs. Holland's script refers to a little
dog. Mrs. Verrall in her Beport, p. 269, speaks of "the
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 359
dog," and on p. 271 mentions that Mrs. Forbes was accus-
tomed to have two dogs constantly with her.
(5) Mrs. Holland's script of June 25th (a) purports to come
from Mr. Gurney, who is mentioned several times in Mrs.
Verrall's Eeport as associated with Mrs. Forbes's script, and
(b) speaks of lilies and roses. Lilies formed the subject
of two cross-correspondences between Mrs. Verrall and Mrs.
Forbes (Eeport, pp. 234 and 256), and Mrs. Verrall (op. cit.
p. 224, foot-note) says that Mrs. Forbes's garden was full of
associations with her son, and that allusions to certain flowers
growing in it had been made in her sittings with Mrs.
Thompson.
Summary of References to Mrs. Forbes.
To sum up the veridical statements apparently relating to
Mrs. Forbes, the following were obtained when Mrs. Holland
was in complete ignorance of her :
(1) March 15th. Description of Mrs. Forbes's dining-room.
(2) March 2 1 st. Some further details about her house, etc.
(3) March 31st and April 1st. A few trivial details.
After seeing Mrs. Verrall's proofs, Mrs. Holland obtained
:
(4) May loth. Description of Mr. Forbes (whose name
only is mentioned by Mrs. Verrall), the real Christian name of
Talbot Forbes, and references to the lotus and lily, appropriate
to him.
(5) May 23rd. Mention of the Winged Victory, appro-
priate to his school.
(6) May 30th. The initial "T." with drawings (double
wine-glass, flower in pot, butterfly, and dog on sofa) appropriate
to his holidays at home.
(7) June 25th. Mention of dog, lilies and roses.
Of these, it seems that only the references on June 25th
and perhaps the Christian name could have been derived from
Mrs. Verrall's Report, in which nothing is said of Talbot
Forbes's school or of his boyhood.
Discussion of the Psychometric Theory.
We may now consider whether there is any ground for
supposing that what is called " psychometry "—that is, an
360 Alice Johnson. [part
alleged influence emanating from an inanimate object—played
any part in producing the veridical statements in Mrs. Holland's
script discussed in this section. It has been shown that
:
(1) On receiving Mrs. Verrall's ring Mrs. Holland had a
remarkably correct impression (on March loth, 1906,) of a
room in Mrs. Forbes's house to which Mrs. Verrall was going
that day.
(2) On trying again with the ring, Mrs. Holland obtained
statements, some of which were appropriate to Mrs. Verrall,
some to Mr. Balfour and his family, and some to Mrs.
Forbes (on March 1 7th) ; some correct statements about
what Mrs. Verrall was then doing at Mrs. Forbes's house,
and about the house ; also a passage which T have classified
under the " Eoden Noel" cross-correspondence (on March 21st);
a trivial statement about Mrs. Verrall's dress, and references
to Eoden Noel and Fawcett (on March 28th). None of this
has any connection with the past history of Mrs. Verrall's ring.
(3) With Mrs. Forbes's glove, Mrs. Holland obtained (on
March 31st and April 1st) some correct statements about
Mrs. Forbes.
(4) While Mrs. Forbes was thinking about sending some
objects that had belonged to her son, but two days before
she actually sent them, Mrs. Holland's script (on May 15th)
gave a description of a man, identified as Mr. Forbes by both
Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Forbes, and later in the same script
the name of her son appeared, and some statements appro-
priate to him.
(5) On receiving the objects sent by Mrs. Forbes through
me, Mrs. Holland guessed that they belonged to Mr. Feilding
and had also some connection with Mr. Myers, and (on May
22nd) her script stated correctly that the electric wiring in
Mr. Feilding's house was in a dangerous condition, referred to
the cemetery at Eome which contains a memorial tablet to
Mr. Myers, and then went on to some statements appropriate
to Mrs. Forbes. On May 23rd with Talbot Forbes's glove
and bird comes the reference to the Winged Victory; but
the statue of the Winged Victory had been given to his
school after his death, and so had nothing to do with these
objects. On May 30th, without the objects, several appro-
priate points are mentioned and associated with his initial
;
LV\] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 361
and later (on June 25th) there is a passage perhaps intended
to relate to him.
Thus it appears that some of the most appropriate or correct
statements in this series were not obtained in connection with
any of the objects, but (in one case) before they came into
Mrs. Holland's hands ; and that the veridical statements in
her script had little or nothing to do with the past history
of the objects, but were concerned rather with the past or
present doings or surroundings of their owners (Mrs. Verrall
and Mrs. Forbes), or of other persons unconnected with
them. Further, that Mrs. Holland's script was clearly led
into certain tracks,—in the case of Mrs. Verrall by her
knowledge of the owner, and in the case of Mr. Feilding and
Mr. Myers by her guess at him.
The whole series is of just the same character as the
writings produced without any such objects and, in so far as
the statements are veridical and evidential, they point
far more to telepathy from Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Forbes, or
Mr. Feilding than to any influence emanating from the
objects.
It may be noted also that, as in all " psychometric " experi-
ments, it is impossible for the sensitive to avoid drawing some
inference—conscious or subconscious—from the appearance or
nature of the objects. Thus Mrs. Holland cannot help observ-
ing that Mrs. Verrall's ring comes in a case marked with the
initials of her Christian names only ; she cannot help seeing
that the man's glove has been lying by for some time.
" Psychometric " experiments, in fact, are in some respects
analogous to experiments in thought-transference when there is
contact between the experimenters, or when they are in sight
or hearing of each other and therefore unable altogether to
avoid giving or receiving some indications as to what is to
be transferred. In the case of psychometry also, the sight or
feeling of the object may sometimes mislead the sensitive, and
will tend probably in all cases to bring the supraliminal
consciousness into play, and so interfere to some extent with
the action of the subliminal.
To return to the experiments with Mrs. Verrall : Mrs.
Holland's next script was on April 4th, 1906, as follows:
362 Alice Johnson. [part
(Wednesday. April 4th, 1906. 10.30 p.m.)

—

Drop preconceived notions.
*****
Most of the latter part of this script, omitted here, is quoted
in the section on " Fawcett," see p. 344. The first part seems
to express a general desire on the part of the control, either
to produce evidence, or to have the evidence already produced
properly understood. " Boston " probably means Dr. Hodgson.
The chestnut trees in Trinity are a conspicuous feature of the
meadow at the back of the College in the spring and autumn.
" She will understand at Easter " 1 took at the time to
refer to my pre-occupation with the " cross-correspondences
"
which I was then studying in the proofs of Mrs. Verrall's
Beport, of which Mrs. Holland knew nothing at this time. I
had been discussing these with Mr. Piddington and was
convinced that there was some special significance in them
that we had not yet understood. The theory propounded in
the next Chapter on Cross-correspondences was simmering
in my mind, but first came to me clearly on the afternoon of
April 12th, 1906, the Thursday before Easter. On coming
back to London after Easter, I mentioned it to Mr. Piddington,
and he accepted it as the probable solution. The whole of
the script, up to and culminating in this phrase, seems to
imply that we were on the verge of some definite step. How
far the implication was justified, the reader must judge from
the next Chapter.
Mrs. Verrall's script of the same day was as follows
:
(April 4, 1906. 11 p.m.)
But to-night there were three glasses on the table—why is that 1
1

? What makes me think of a pair? Ask

On seeing a copy of this, Mrs. Holland wrote to me on
April 11th that none of it had any meaning for her except
the description of the meeting. She says
:
On the 7th "there was a meeting at the corner of a street where
the road is wider," but not " face to face." I ran after some one
to end a misunderstanding. . . . She was a little "pleased," I think.
It was certainly " not by arrangement
;
" she had returned after
years away.
C ROSS-CORRESPONDENCE.
Eheu Fugaces.
The next scripts were written on April 11th. Mrs. Verrall's
was as follows
:
(April 11, 1906. 11 p.m.)
Nuneaton or some such word was wanted
It was not for that he went went away in the long ago
—
Bells and a whip, and snow upon the ground bright sunshine and
hard frost—they drive together over frozen roads. I see their backs
only, fair hair under the cap.
Maloja or near the Maloja. 7 years ago
Something fluttered and was gone— And the black bat night
has flown— She is here by the gate alone, and the scent of the
roses blown.
That has been repeated— There is an effort to have the same
words this time.
On bat's wings rides Queen Mab.
It is obvious that the same idea,—that of flight, —is here
repeated several times, as the script itself remarks. The first
part seems an imaginary description of an elopement ; then
" something fluttered and was gone " ; then the quotation from
364 Alice Johnson. [part
Tennyson's Maud, " and the black bat night has flown" etc.
;
which leads on to the idea of another kind of flight, " on bat's
wings rides Queen Mab." And the script declares that there
has been " an effort to have the same words this time."
The effort seems to have been successful, for Mrs. Holland's
script of the same day, after a passing reference apparently
to the eruption of Vesuvius which was then going on,
exclaims :
" Eheu fugaces." 1
In the letter dated April 12th enclosing this script, Mrs.
Holland wrote to me of her experiments with Mrs. Verrall
that she wished to continue the Wednesday writings, and she
added, " I can't be content till we get the same message."
This corresponds rather strikingly with the phrase in Mrs.
Verrall's script (which, of course, she had not then seen, as
I only sent her a copy of it on April 16th): "There is an
effort to have the same words this time." I do not remember-
that Mrs. Holland has made a similar remark at any other
time. That the idea was prominent in her mind at the
moment is shown by the fact that, writing to Mrs. Verrall
on the same day, she said :
" I hope we shall keep up our
Wednesday writing wherever I am. I can't help believing
that we shall be tuned into accord some day and register
the same messages ; but it may take years and will certainly
take patience." w •
Tt will be noticed that here again, as in the cross-cor-
respondence, " Ave Eoma immortalis," Mrs. Verrall gives an
elaborate description, involving much repetition, whereas Mrs.
Holland sums up the whole conception in a single phrase,
and in both cases in a Latin phrase,—familiar enough, no
doubt, but one would hardly expect to find Latin at all in
the script of a writer who does not know the language.
The whole of Mrs. Holland's script of this date is as
follows
:
(Wednesday, April 11th, 1906. 11.30 p.m.)
(1) A great black shadow and the sound of a wailing wind—Eheu
fugaces. 2
1
Horace, Odes, ii. 14.
2 Mrs. Verrall points out that the words "black" and "wailing" both occur
in the Ode which begins Eheu fugaces. Lines 17, 18 run :

(1) Besides the cross-correspondence involved in the phrase
" Eheu fugaces " the following points are to be noted :
(a) This description is no doubt meant for Sir Oliver Lodge,
whom Mrs. Holland was expecting shortly to meet for the first
time at a friend's house. She was greatly looking forward to
the meeting, as she told me.
(b) " Yateley Boad, Brummagem." This refers to a topic
further developed on April loth, see below.
(c)
" She is at home again now "—is probably intended to
refer to Mrs. Verrall. Mrs. Holland knew that Mrs. Verrall
had been away from home and that she would be back some
time in April, and was waiting for her return to send one of
her rings, so that Mrs. Verrall might try automatic script
with it. On April 11th (the clay of this script) I wrote to
"Visendus ater flumine languido
Cocytos errans."
i.e., "We shall have to see the black River of Wailing, wandering with
sluggish stream."
366 Alice Johnson. [part
Mrs. Holland, " I have just heard from Mrs. Verrall that she
is now at home again and will be glad to have a ring etc."
Mrs. Holland returned this letter to me in its original envelope,
so that I might see from the post marks that she did not
receive it until after writing her script.
(d) Seems to describe a motor accident, which I cannot
identify.
(e) Another reference to the eruption of Vesuvius, mentioned
at the beginning of the script.
(/) Mrs. Verrall, on seing a copy of this script sent to her
on April 16th, 1906, wrote to me on April 18th: "On
Thursday, April 12th (this date is almost certainly ascertained),
about 7.30 p.m., I saw an actual owl within two yards of
me, close to the house. I had never seen an owl so distinctly,
and went to tell Helen of the occurrence, which interested me."
Miss Verrall added :
" To the best of my belief, Thursday was
the date."
On the other hand, Mrs. Holland tells me that one of the
milder terms of abuse used in India is ooloo or ooloo hi butcha
(owl's child), and that at the time she regarded the phrase
" An owl this evening " as being addressed to herself by the
Gurney control.
I quote one more script, to complete the reference to Yately
lioad, Birmingham, mentioned on April 11th. This was written
when Mrs. Holland was staying in the house where she met
Sir Oliver Lodge. Another visitor was an intimate friend of
Dr. Sidgwick's, and this probably evoked by association of ideas
the description of him which follows the sentence signed " H."
The whole script is as follows
:

I made enquiries from Sir Oliver Lodge, and he informed
me that Professor W. J. Ashley lived at 3 Yateley Road,
Edgbaston, Birmingham, the address given in the script of
April 11th. He sent a copy of the sentences on this topic
to Professor Ashley, asking if there seemed to be anything
significant about them, and Professor Ashley replied
:
May 24, 1906.
1866 a token. 1866 was the year when I was most seriously ill
in my life. They called it "general debility," and I was set up by
being sent down to AVales and by abundant coddiver oil. But for
the country home of my grandparents to which I could be sent, I
might easily have pined away in a Bermondsey which was more
insanitary then than now probably. Some circumstances of my
illness made a great impression on my imagination. . . . the enter-
taining literature for children which came most easily within [my]
reach took the form of little bundles of coloured tracts— pink, bluish,
green, etc., about missionaries ! I have always supposed I remembered
having my bed littered with these, of divers hues. . . . Doubtless
the whole episode impressed [my parents] and me. But I am pretty
sure the year 1 866 didn't stand out in their minds. Certainly it
didn't in mine ;
though when your note arrived I thought it probable
that was the year. And there are at least half-a-dozen other years
in my life which would have seemed very significant, if they had
happened to be in the communication.
The second Emperor of that name conveys absolutely nothing to
me. ... It may be worth mentioning that sometimes in indexes
my name stands under that of the Lord Ashley of the Factory Acts
(Shaftesbury). [In one] it appears thus:

There and elsewhere I am " second of the name "

Obviously no evidential value can be attached to the mention
368 Alice Johnson. [part
of an address such as that of Professor Ashley, which is to be
found in books of reference (Who's Who, for instance), as it is
impossible for Mrs. Holland to be sure that she had not at
some time happened to see it. It seems to me indeed probable
that it was a subliminal recollection, which emerged because
her mind was rather full of Sir Oliver Lodge at the time, and
therefore unconsciously on the scent for any association with
Birmingham.
In the same way I suspect that the presence of Dr. Sidg-
wick's friend in the house evoked what was certainly a
subliminal recollection of something she had read about him,
for his habit of standing or pacing about with one hand in his
beard was mentioned in the Daily Chronicle review of the
Memoir of him, which she had read (see above, p. 318). In
this case, as in many others, it was only through Mrs. Holland's
great care in noting and sending me information about points
possibly bearing on her script that I could trace the source
of this passage. But the fact that so many passages have
been traced to sources of this kind shows that the utmost
caution is necessary in estimating all the others which might
conceivably have a similar origin.
The whole study of this case tends to confirm the view
that no statement in automatic script that has ever been in
print, or is of such a nature as to be known to a good many
people, can be regarded as really good evidence of supernormal
knowledge. It follows that statements about events in the
past can hardly ever afford good evidence, because, as time
goes on, there is always a possibility of more and more people
getting to know about them, and happening to mention them
to the automatist.
The "Scribe incident" mentioned above (see p. 283) is a
good instance of an event that had occurred so recently that
we were able to determine that the knowledge of it was con-
fined to a certain small group of persons. After a few months,
we should have been less confident about it. Of course the
best evidence for an automatist's ignorance of an event is
afforded by cases where the event is actually occurring else-
where at the time the script is being produced, and a good
many instances of this kind have been given in this paper.
But owing to the careful and systematic means taken by
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 369
Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Holland to have their scripts preserved
and properly annotated, statements which are not actually
contemporaneous may often afford excellent evidence, since we
know the date when, if ever, each fact became normally
known to the writer. Thus, some of the cross- correspondences
were not quite contemporaneous, but (except in the cases
indicated) all occurred when one writer was completely in the
dark about the references of the other to the same topic.
In the analysis at the beginning of the paper, I have tried, for
the convenience of the reader, to indicate which cases are best
worth study from an evidential point of view up to the end
of the period dealt with here. The later portions of the script
must be left to be dealt with later. Meanwhile in my next
and final chapter, some theoretical considerations are discussed.
CHAPTEE VII.
The Theory of Cross-correspondences.
"It is not we who are in reality the discoverers here. The ex-
periments which are being made are not the work of earthly skill.
All that we can contribute to the new result is an attitude of
patience, attention, care ; an honest readiness to receive and weigh
whatever may be given into our keeping by intelligences beyond
our own. Experiments, I say, there are ;
probably experiments of
a complexity and difficulty which surpass our imagination ; but they
are made from the other side of the gulf, by the efforts of spirits
who discern pathways and possibilities which for us are impene-
trably dark."

(Human Personality, Vol. II. p. 275).
In Human Personality Mr. Myers hints more than once at
a favourite theory of his that the influence of science on
modern thought is not confined to this life alone, but may
be carried on into the next, and so tend to improve the
evidence for communication from the dead. The latter, he
suggests, are coming to understand more and more clearly
what constitutes really good evidence, and may gradually
discover better means of producing it. For the heading of
this chapter I have chosen the passage in which he formulates
this conjecture most .
clearly, since it would seem from our
370 Alice Johnson. [part
recent investigations that some such experiments as he there
foreshadowed may actually be taking place.
Among the incidents related in this paper that seem to
point to some form of supernormal communication between
Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall, two main types are to be dis-
tinguished : (a) those in which one automatist refers to events
happening to the other, or to some more or less marked
feature in her surroundings, of which the first writer can
apparently have no normal knowledge ; and (b) those in which
independent references to the same tojic occur at about the
same time in the scripts of both writers. It is to the latter
type only that I apply the term " Cross-correspondence."
I will first briefly summarise the results already obtained
along these lines.
Mr. Myers and Dr. Hodgson made attempts at different
times to obtain connections between the utterances—either
spoken or written—of different automatists. It is by no
means easy even to obtain suitable conditions for trying such
experiments, and unfortunately, as far as I am aware, no
complete record of these attempts seems to exist. Some
references to them, however, occur in a number of letters
written by Mr. Myers to Mrs. Thompson from July, 1898,
to January, 1901, and Mrs. Thompson has kindly allowed me
to read these letters and to quote here from them. The
earliest mention of the subject that I can find is on October
24th, 1898, as follows:
"Dr. Hodgson is staying on in America for the winter,
sitting with Mrs. Piper. It would be grand if we could get
communication between the '
controls ' on each side."
On July 31st, 1899, referring apparently to some such
communication, Mr. Myers writes :
"It is a small matter; but I hope it may be the beginning
of that spiritual intercourse between the Hampstead and
Boston centres which we so much desire."
On November 29th, 1899, Mr. Myers expresses the hope
that Mrs. Thompson may meet another sensitive in his house.
" Your spirits might travel (he writes) between drawing-room
and study."
On December 2nd, 1899, he explains further his plans for
experiments between Mrs. Thompson and this lady, who, he
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 371
says, " is anxious to see you repeatedly . . . partly that
your attendant spirits may make acquaintance and may be
able to transmit messages. I think this an excellent plan
and am very glad that she desires it. The evidential draw-
back in the world's eyes (possible plottings together !) is quite
nullified by the power of ourselves suggesting words for [her]
to say through you, or for you to say through her. . . .
I think it really important and possible to get your spirits,
hers, and Mrs. Piper's, to co-operate in their world and use,
perhaps, each sensitive's brain indifferently."
The next and last reference to the topic in these letters is
on August 2nd, 1900, when Mr. Myers suggests the possibility
of communication between the " controls " of Mrs. Thompson
and those of the lady who is called " Miss Eawson " in Mr.
Piddington's paper referred to below. Mr. Myers writes that
he hopes to go on in a few days' time from a sitting with
Mrs. Thompson to one with " Miss Eawson," and that then,
perhaps, a communication between the two groups of "con-
trols " might occur.
A phenomenon somewhat analogous to this connection be-
tween two groups of controls was exemplified in the experi-
ments of Dr. van Eeden with Mrs. Thompson (see his paper on
sitting's with Mrs. Thompson in Proceedings S.P.E., Vol. XVII.,
especially pp. 86-7 and 112-115). Dr. van Eeden, having
cultivated the power of controlling his own dreams, so as to
be able to dream of performing actions which he had planned
while awake, arranged with Mrs. Thompson that he would
occasionally call Nelly (her " control ") in his dreams after
returning to Holland, and that if she heard him calling she
should tell Mr. Piddington, who was in charge of the
sittings, at his next sitting. On three occasions in January
and February, 1900, some success was obtained in these
experiments ; that is, Nelly stated that she had heard Dr.
van Eeden calling and had been to see him ; the dates she
gave were approximately, though not exactly, the same as
those recorded in his diary of dreams ;
but on each occasion
she gave details, which were afterwards verified, as to his
circumstances at the time. On a fourth occasion (April 19th,
1900), when Nelly stated that she had been to see Dr. van
Eeden, he had no dream of her at the time, but she gave a
372 Alice Johnson. [part
description of his condition which corresponded with what it
had been during the early part of the same month.
A case of a somewhat similar kind is recorded in Dr.
Hodgson's report on Mrs. Piper {Proceedings, Vol. VIII.
p. 120), where Mr. M. N. relates that Mrs. Piper's control,
" Dr. Phinuit," had said that he had tried to influence Mr.
N.'s dying father about certain matters connected with his
will. Later Mr. N.'s sister, who had been with their father
at the time, told him that he had repeatedly complained of
the presence of an old man at the foot of his bed, who
annoyed him by discussing his private affairs.
Some interesting connections between the automatisms of Mrs.
Thompson and those of other sensitives are recorded in Mr.
Piddington's paper " On the Types of Phenomena displayed in
Mrs. Thompson's Trance " in Proceedings S.P.P., Vol. XVIII.
pp. 104-307. In one case (see pp. 205-208), during a sitting
of Mr. Myers's with Miss Pawson at Valescure on the after-
noon of December 22nd, 1900, a soi-disant Mrs. Thompson
"possessed" Miss Pawson for a minute or two. Mr. Piddington
heard of this from Mr. Myers, and at his next meeting with
Mrs. Thompson on January 1st, 1901, she told him in reply
to a question that on the afternoon of December 22nd, she
was resting in her own house at Hampstead and slept part of
the time. After telling him this she became entranced, and
during the trance Nelly told him that she had been to see Miss
Pawson on the day in question. The hour of Mrs. Thompson's
sleep and Miss Eawson's experience did not exactly coincide.
In the last section of Mr. Piddington's paper (op. cit., pp.
294-307), he describes "a few other instances of apparent
concordance between the trance-utterances of Mrs. Thompson
and those of Miss Pawson, and the automatic writing of the
lady whom [we call Mrs. Forbes], of which the prima facie
explanation is either that Mrs. Thompson in trance becomes
aware of the content of their automatic speech or script, or
that one and the same control has conveyed similar communi-
cations through two different mediums."
Full details of these cases are given by Mr. Piddington,
and he concludes
:
The resemblances quoted above are far from complete; they are
suggestive rather than indicative of supernormal agency; yet I
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 373
cannot ascribe them to chance. If they are not supernormal, I
would attribute them to the minds of both automatists having
developed from similar data in their common possession similar
fantasies, accordant with the general trend of ideas that runs through
spiritistic manifestations. But at least I claim for them serious study,
for could we be fortunate enough (and I am rather sanguine that
we may be) to multiply analogous and more clinching instances of
the same phenomenon, it would open up one of the most promising
lines for observation, and even, perhaps, for experimentation
(p. 307).
Mr. Piddington's remark that some correspondence may
result merely from similar trains of ideas in the minds of the
two automatists should certainly be kept in view in the in-
terpretation of all such cases, and it may perhaps be held to
account for some of the cross-correspondences in my report.
But his insistence on the importance of this type of pheno-
menon and his hope that it would lead to good results in
future have, I think, been amply justified by the recent rapid
development of cross-correspondences—a development which has
taken place since Mr. Myers's death.
This was shown first in Mrs. Verrall's script, and a consider-
able section of her Report on it (pp. 205-275) is devoted to an
account of the cross-correspondences between her script and the
script or automatic speech of other automatists. One of the first of
these, in May, 1901, was with Mrs. Thompson {op. tit., pp. 207-9),
and a striking case occurred with Mrs. Piper (pp. 213-17); but
the most important were the long series with Mrs. Forbes, dating
from February, 1901, onwards. In this account Mrs. Verrall
includes under the common term of " Cross-correspondence
"
cases where one automatist describes correctly some fact about
the other, and those where references to the same topic occur
independently in the two scripts ; but a considerable proportion
of the cases are of the latter type, to which I think it most
convenient to restrict the term.
In studying these in proof in the early part of 1906, I
was struck by the fact that in some of the most remarkable
instances the statements in the script of one writer were by no
means a simple reproduction of statements in the script of the
other, but seemed to represent different aspects of the same idea,
one supplementing or completing the other. Thus, in one case
2a
374 Alice Johnson. [part
(p. 223), Mrs. Forbes's script, purporting to come from her son
Talbot, stated that he must now leave her, since he was looking-
for a sensitive who wrote automatically, in order that he might
obtain corroboration of her own writing. Mrs. Verrall, on the
same day, wrote of a fir-tree planted in a garden, and the script
was signed with a sword and suspended bugle. The latter was
part of the badge of the regiment to which Talbot Forbes
had belonged, and Mrs. Forbes had in her garden some fir-
trees, grown from seed sent to her by her son. These facts
were unknown to Mrs. Verrall.
In another case (pp. 241-245)—too complicated to sum-
marise here—Mrs. Forbes produced, on November 26th and
27th, 1902, references, absolutely meaningless to herself, to a
passage in the Symposium which Mrs. Verrall had been read-
ing on those clays. These references also applied appropriately
to an obscure sentence in Mrs. Verrall's own script of November
26th, and on December 18th attempts were made in Mrs.
Forbes's script to give a certain test word, " Dion " or " Dy,"
which, it was stated, " will be found in Myers' own . .
."
Mrs. Verrall interpreted the test word at the time, for reasons
given, as " Diotima," and a description of the same part of
the Symposium, including the mention of Diotima, did occur in
Human Personality, which was published about three months
later, in February, 1903. Further references to the Symposium
appeared in Mrs. Forbes's script in the early part of 1903
(see Mrs. Verrall's Report, p. 246).
In another case (pp. 269-271), October 16th, 1904, Mrs.
Verrall's script gave details, afterwards verified, of what
Mrs. Forbes was doing, and immediately afterwards Mrs. Verrall
had a mental impression of Mrs. Forbes sitting in her drawing-
room, with the figure of her son standing looking at her.
Mrs. Forbes's script of the same day, purporting to come from
her son, stated that he was present and wished she could see
him, and that a test was being given for her at Cambridge.
I became convinced through the study of these cases that
there was some special purpose in the particular form they
took,-—all the more because in Mrs. Verrall's script statements
were often associated with them, apparently to draw attention
to some peculiar kind of test,—described, e.g. as superposing
certain tilings on others, when all would be clear.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 375
The characteristic of these cases—or at least of some of
them—is that we do not get in the writing of one auto-
matist anything like a mechanical verbatim reproduction of
phrases in the other ; we do not even get the same idea
expressed in different ways,—as might well result from direct
telepathy between them. What we get is a fragmentary utter-
ance in one script, which seems to have no particular point
or meaning, and another fragmentary utterance in the other,
of an equally pointless character ; but when we put the two
together, we see that they supplement one another, and that
there is apparently one coherent idea underlying both, but only
partially expressed in each.
It occurred to me, then, that by this method, if by any, it
might be possible to obtain evidence more conclusive than any
obtained hitherto of the action of a third intelligence, external
to the minds of both automatists. If we simply find the same
idea expressed—even though in different forms—by both of
them, it may, as I have just said, most easily be explained by
telepathy between them ; but it is much more difficult to
suppose that the telepathic perception of one fragment could
lead to the production of another fragment which can only, after
careful comparison, be seen to be related to the first.
The weakness of all well-authenticated cases of apparent
telepathy from the dead is, of course, that they can generally
be explained by telepathy from the living. If the knowledge
displayed by the medium is possessed by any person certainly
existing,—that is, any living person,—we must refer it to that
source rather than to a person whose existence is uncertain,
—
that is, a dead person. To do otherwise would be to beg the
whole question at issue, for the very thing to be proved is
the existence of the dead person.
Hitherto the evidence for survival has depended on state-
ments that seem to show the control's recollection of incidents
in his past life. It would be useless for him to communicate
telepathically anything about his present life, because there
could be no proof of the truth of the communication. This
is the fundamental difference between the types of evidence
for telepathy from the living and for telepathy from the dead.
And the fact suggests a certain conception as to the nature
of survival propounded by Dr. Leaf in his review of Human
376 Alice Johnson. [part
Personality, in the Proceedings S.P.E., Vol. XVIII. pp. 53
et seq. He says :
[The evidence] seems to me to show that after the death
of the body there remains a more or less coherent complex of
memories which is accessible to the subliminal self of certain living
persons. What I do not as yet see is that this complex has such
coherence as can enable us to consider it a personality. . . . The
evidence seems to point rather to an alternative which is at least
consistent with analogy . . . that, as the physical body only gradually
dissolves into its elements after death, so the spiritual retains for a
time a certain coherence which is no proof of life. ... It may be
possible for peculiarly gifted living spirits to behold the gradually
disintegrating spirit, and bring us word, with more or less com-
pleteness, of what the spiritual man was during life (pp. 56-7).
Again, he says (p. 5 9):
[The evidence] proves, I think, that memories of the dead survive
and are under special conditions accessible to us. But I do not see
that it proves the survival of what we call the living spirit, the
personality—a unit of consciousness, limited and self-contained, a
centre of will and vital force, carrying on into another world the
aspirations and the affections of this.
I venture to think that some of the evidence obtained since
Dr. Leaf wrote has a certain bearing on this argument.
Evidence for telepathy from the dead, as he implies and as I
have just stated, has hitherto mainly referred to events in the
past. Now, telepathy relating to the present, such as we some-
times get between living persons, must be stronger evidentially
than telepathy relating to the past, because it is much easier
to exclude normal knowledge of events in the present than of
events in the past. But it has been supposed impossible that
we could ever get this kind of evidence for telepathy from
the dead ; since events in the present are either known to
some living person, in which case we could not exclude his
telepathic agency; or they are unknown to any living person,
in which case it would be difficult or impossible to prove that
they had occurred.
In these cross-correspondences, however, we find apparently
telepathy relating to the present,—that is, the corresponding
statements are approximately contemporaneous,—and to events
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 377
in the present which, to all intents and purposes, are unknown
to any living person, since the meaning and point of her script
is often uncomprehended by each autoniatist until the solution
is found through putting the two scripts together. At the
same time we have proof of what has occurred in the scripts
themselves. Thus it appears that this method is directed
towards satisfying our evidential requirements.
Now, granted the possibility of communication, it may be
supposed that within the last few years a certain group of
persons have been trying to communicate with us, who are
sufficiently well instructed to know all the objections that
reasonable sceptics have urged against the previous evidence,
and sufficiently intelligent to realise to the full all the force
of these objections. It may be supposed that these persons
have invented a new plan,—the plan of cross-correspondences,
—
to meet the sceptics' objections. There is no doubt that the
cross-correspondences are a characteristic element in the scripts
that we have been collecting in the last few years,—the scripts
of Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Forbes, Mrs. Holland, and, still more
recently, Mrs. Piper. And the important point is that the
element is a new one. We have reason to believe, as I
have shown above, that the idea of making a statement in
one script complementary of a statement in another had not
occurred to Mr. Myers in his life-time, for there is no reference
to it in any of his written utterances on the subject that I
have been able to discover. Also, it seems to me almost
certain that if he had thought of it durina,' his life-time, I
should have heard of it while helping him in the publication
of Human Personality, or he would have mentioned it to some
of his friends and colleagues in the S.P.R. Neither did those
who have been investigating automatic script since his death
invent this plan, if plan it be. It was not the automatists
that detected it, but a student of the scripts ; it has every
appearance of being an element imported from outside ; it
suggests an independent invention, an active intelligence con-
stantly at work in the present, not a mere echo or remnant
of individualities of the past.
This theory of the cross-correspondences seemed confirmed
by some of the phrases in Mrs. Verrall's script which were
quoted incidentally in her Report, as well as by some of the
378 Alice Johnson. [part
obscure Latin words, which she says were used in special
senses, unintelligible to her at the time. Thus she writes
(see her Report, p. 39) :
There are further a few cases of words apparently used in a special
sense, though they have so many possible meanings that it cannot
be decided with certainty what is intended by their use in the script.
For instance, repeated injunctions are to be found for the application
of processes described as destringere [to unsheathe], nexere [to weave
or bind together], superpomre [to superpose], to the words of the
script ; in particular, it is constantly urged that if some words were
taken, sume, and some process of superposition were then applied,
superpone, sense would be seen where now there is apparent nonsense.
But no definite directions have ever been given as to this process
of superposition, and the later writings contain few references to it.
All these phrases appear to me efforts to express in different
ways the idea of the supplementary parts of a cross- corre-
spondence, which, when properly " superposed," " woven together,"
and " unsheathed," become clear. The same notion is, 1 think,
expressed in yet another form in the following passage from
an automatic poem written by Mrs. Verrall on July 20th, 1904,
when experimenting simultaneously with " Miss Eawson," (see
her Report, p. 36 2):
So flash successive visions in a glass
the while we dreaming scarce behold them pass.
Yet all the while on the awakened soul
each flitting image helps imprint the whole
and superposed on what was first impressed
fills so the outline, colour, and the rest,
and while we only watch the master's hand,
no glimpse vouchsafed us of the building planned,
stone upon stone, the battlements arise,
till the fair fabric flashes in the skies.
Later, I asked Mrs. Verrall to look through all her script
up to Easter, 1906, and make a complete list of passages in
it bearing on this theory of cross-correspondences, and I quote
here a number of the more definite of these passages, using
Mrs. Verrall's translations of the Latin and Greek phrases in
them. It will lie seen that much of the early script is uncon-
struable and only approximations to the meaning can be given
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 379
in translation. But I include passages in which the general
intention seems to me unmistakable, in order to show the
gradual and persistent development of the idea.
(March 8th, 1901.) (In Latin : Do not put down my pen and
a second a second [1 pen] . . . some day a later part will come,
yours, and the final explanation will commend itself to you.) 1
(March 21st, 1901.) (In Latin : Oh, if you cannot weave together
pertinaciously, write all you know. Soon will come the inviolate
light of the Sibyl. Either one of the two receiving will choose.
Do not fail her who asks.) 2
Three days later, Mrs. Forbes's script requested Mrs. Verrall

On this Mrs. Verrall notes :
The words monazein [see below, Dec. 19th, 1902] and duazein occur in the
script. Monas means "a unit" and ducts means the number "two," so that
these verbs ought to mean "to make one" and "to make two." Monazein is
used in Greek in the sense of "to be alone," and duazein is used in the sense
of "to couple." The word monei in the script of April 3rd, 1901, does not
exist. It is obviously meant to be connected with memos (alone), but the form
is incorrect.

Mrs. Verrall notes :
The word stoichazein used on Sep. 28th, 1901, and again on March 19th, 1902
[see below] does not exist. There is a word stochazesthai which means to
guess, but this is only used in the passive form and the first syllable has o only
not oi.
There is a word sioicheion which means "element" or "uncompounded thing."
There are many derivates from this, but none could be formed with a, as
stoichazein. It seems, however, that some supposed derivative of stoicheion is
aimed at, at least on March 19th, 1902, where it is combined with the word
sunthetos. For the two words stoicheion and suntheton are contrasted by
Aristotle as meaning respectively "primary element" and "thing compounded."
The meaning on September 28th, 1901, is quite uncertain, and on July 13th,
1902, the word sunstochazei must, I think, be a part of stochazesthai. It has
the o and not the oi, and the addition of the preposition sun makes no sente
in any word derived from stoicheion.
There is also a word stoichas (stem, stoichad-) meaning "lying in rows or
lines." The word was not known to me till I found it in Liddell and Scott's
lexicon. Stoichazein would mean "to make a stoichas," and therefore on
September 28th, 1901, the meaning might be "arrange in rows; in mysteries
I weave," etc. On March 19th, 1902, the meaning would be " why then do-
you arrange in rows? it is better to receive," etc., but in this case the
opposition with suntheton disappears. Considering the general tendency of the
script to make up verbs from nouns without much attention to philology, I do
not think reliance can be placed on exact forms of Greek, and I should not
be surprised at finding stoichazein used to mean "make a stoicheion," though
it ought to mean "make a stoichas."

the friends see together the same light is the force that we use for
this letter.
Thus Mrs. Verrall's script contains a phrase indicating that
a cross-correspondence is occurring ; while Mrs. Forbes's script,
which seems to show some slight connection with Mrs. Verrall's,
refers—as I take it—to some faint telepathy between the
living, similar to and perhaps reinforced by telepathy from
the dead (see Mrs. Verrall's Report, p. 226).
(Dec. 10th, 1901.) Many men for many arts—partners in the
whole. Believe to-night.
(In Latin: The later part will wait; it is not yet clear.) 1
Later in this script occurs the passage quoted above (see
p. 218) about the grey figure not to be feared to be seen
on an anniversary, which formed a possible cross-correspondence
with Mrs. Piper (see Mrs. Verrall's Report, p. 213).
(Jan. 4th, 1902.) (In Greek: Musical (endoxis?) makes all
rhythmical. The sign is uncombined and uninvestigated (?) but not
without rhythm (?). Call in others ; alone you are not of much use.
And indeed certain others have already spoken in a voice which,
though unintelligible, yet sounded sweetly. Why not you too?) 2
But it is hard—much confusion —go on trying now.
This is followed by an attempt to send a message to Dr.
Hodgson, probably intended for a cross-correspondence with
Mrs. Piper, which seems to have been unsuccessful (see Mrs.
Verrall's Report, pp. 282-3).
(March 19th, 1902.) (In Greek: There fits together only what
has been fitted together, although it does not meet(?). For not
without something put together is the whole rhythmical. Why
then do you (stoichazeis) it is better that you receive whatever thought

(Sep. 6th, 1902.) (In Greek: Only use intelligence; weave together
perpetually things which hang together, even if they seem dragged
in.) 1
The next two passages occur in connection with an attempted
cross-correspondence with Mrs. Forbes, related on p. 238 of
Mrs. Verrall's Report.
(Oct. 27th, 1902.) (In Greek: Do you also jointly write; another

. . . Mrs. [Forbes] has the other words—piece together.
Add hers to yours.
(Oct. 31st, 1902.) You have not understood all—try further. She
has had some words incomplete to be added to and pieced and make
the clue.
The next passage occurred on the day that Mr. F. C.
Constable was planning to ask Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Piper
to try a certain experiment with a sealed envelope (see her
Report, pp. 168-171). Mrs. A^errall knew nothing either of
Mr. Constable, or of his plan, at the time her script was
produced ; but this script seems to show a knowledge of Mr.
Constable's desire, and at the same time an intention to satisfy
it,—not as he had planned by getting the same statement
through both automatists, but by getting part through one and
part through the other.
(Nov. 3rd, 1902.) None the less through others not known speaks
the fate. ... I will give the words between you neither alone can
read but together they will give the clue he wants.
(In Latin: To discover . . . the restoration of love A and not
separation (here [?] and elsewhere words are missing). Now the word
itself returns—the term Charity.) 3
But hers are in English and will fill the gaps. Wait some time
for hers—it is hard to give her words.
The next three passages are connected with the cross-corre-
spondence between Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Forbes about the
Symposium (see her Report, pp. 241-246 and 311-318). This
case was a very complicated one, both series of scripts containing
a number of reciprocally veridical statements. On the first

day involving the connection, Mrs. Verrall wrote (see her
Report, p. 144):
(Nov. 26th, 1902.) (In Greek: What do you name? No one.
Let him include the logeion(V) some one else will learn the whole.
But you unaided are not able to bring one and one together.) 1
(Dec. 19th, 1902.) But through her and you the clue must come
—
I said that long ago.
(Dec. 19th, 1902, later.) (In Greek : Monazein is of advantage.
I have already said that; and not duazein. Put one to one one.
Now it has been said.) 2
(Dec. 26th, 1902.) (In Latin: The fateful sisters twist together

(Jan. 15th, 1903.) Wait for the word. He said 'I will send
the half message to Mrs. Verrall and you have the other half. Tell
Hodgson this, —but you have not got the word yet. ... It was
some time ago through Mrs. Piper, but they were not to tell you.
This seems to refer to an attempt which was apparently
unsuccessful.
The next passage refers again, as I understand it, to the
Symposium cross-correspondence, though this is not stated.
(Jan. 30th, 1903.) (In Greek: What has been talked about by
you fits together with what has been thought by her. To work
together is better and in this case the Separatists are not best. But
there are some cases when division is required, division. Each one
as he speaks should number. The ideas are numbers. And so
numbering benefits.) 4

(Aug. 1 Oth ,
1904.) Now this is other. Sit regularly and wait.
I want something quite different tried —you are not to guess, and
you will probably not understand what you write. But keep it all
and say nothing about it yet. Then at Christmas or perhaps before
you can compare your own words with another's and the truth will
be manifest. But there will be no sensations in what I say—it
will be aimed at something quite other and only a long trial can be
of any use. Begin now to write the words I give . . .
As is well known, various attempts had been made in Mrs.
Verrall's script during 1903 and 1904 to give the contents
of a sealed envelope left by Mr. Myers (see her Report, pp.
299-301 and 423-425). These attempts seemed first to refer
to an envelope said to have been left with Dr. Hodgson
;
but it turned out that Dr. Hodgson possessed no such envelope.
Later,—especially in July, 1904,—specific statements were made
about a sealed envelope left with Sir Oliver Lodge, who did
actually possess one. Mrs. Verrall tells me that she had
always regarded the script of Aug. 10th, 1904, quoted above,
as suggesting that a new type of experiment—she did not
understand what, but something different from the experiments
with sealed envelopes—was to be tried, for she considered
that the script had already completed all it could say about
the envelope. The most specific statements about the envelope
were made during July, 1904, and the only references after-
wards were: (1) on Aug. 14th, 1904, "in one envelope the
reference to Love, in the other to Hope. And you will not
look—Faith is not yours"; and (2) on Nov. 25th, 1904,
another exhortation to open the envelope. This was done on
Dec. 13th, 1904.
Mrs. Holland's reference on Feb. 15th, 1905, to the opening
of this envelope has been related and discussed above (see
p. 241), and it will be remembered that, as far as we can
ascertain, she had no normal knowledge of any of the circum-
stances until Oct. 6th, 1905. Yet on Aug. 8th, 1905, her
script contained the following
:
I want you all to devise a better test. The sealed envelopes are
not the best. Set your wits to work.
At the time this was written, I knew nothing of the similar
sentiment in Mrs. Verrall's script, which, it will be seen,
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 385
applies appropriately to my conception of a cross-correspondence
as something (a) which the automatist herself " will probably
not understand," since it is purposely obscure ; but (b) " the
truth will be manifest " when " you can compare your own
words with another's " ; further (c) " there will be no sensations
in what I say—it will be aimed at something quite other, and
only a long trial can be of any use
' ;
; that is, as I understand
it, there will be no startling results, which will appeal at
once to all the world as conclusive evidence of communications
from the dead ; that is not even the aim ;
only by a long
series of cautious and tentative experiments can we hope to
arrive at the truth.
The following is again from Mrs. Verrall's script
:
(Aug. 21st, 1904.) But the end is not yet nor here—write only,
interpret not —record the bits and when fitted they will make the
whole.
Another metaphor, apparently intended to express the same
idea, occurs in the script of July 11th, 1905, as follows:
A broken thread can you not mend and the
scattered fragments place to perfection.
(In Greek : It was not without him who sets
all in order.)
(In Latin : You ought to unite the parts converging into one. The
figure which is made from them should be contemplated not only
by you but by others well versed in figures. In the midst is a
light with flashing rays, a bright star in the sky.
Like the light-bearing star that rules the seasons,
wandering by night, hidden by the light of the
sun, which yet wanders ever in the heavens night
and day, though it cannot be perceived when the
sun reigns.) 1
And so many things seen not, except from the depths
of Truth's Well, but always there waiting for the seeing mind.

38G Alice Johnson. [PAKT
The metaphor with which the above script opens seems to
be a reminiscence of some earlier utterances. On Feb. 13th,
1902, had occurred the phrase: "Berries or pearls on a
string, and the string breaks but they are not lost—scattered
they were." Still earlier, on April 14th, 1901, reference had
been made to " pearls before swine, my [pearls] perhaps
valueless to you [i.e. Mrs. Verrall]." This earliest reference
is probably a half-humorous complaint that the sayings of
the control are not appreciated. The next one, about pearls
on a string which is broken, may be taken to mean the
fragments of a cross-correspondence,—the same notion being
further developed and amplified on July 11th, 1905, and
apparently symbolised by the drawing of incomplete arcs of a
circle.
The next passage occurs in Mrs. Verrall's script of Feb. 9th,
1906, in connection with the cross-correspondences with Mrs.
Holland :
" Not in the Electra," and " Henry was not mis-
taken " (see above, p. 310).
(Feb. 9th, 1906.) (In Latin and Greek: They grow faint, but are
not without putting together. So what has been believed by the
disciples, if compared with certain other things, adds parts of wisdom.
If not all, why not some'? For instance, this:) 1
We must now consider how far the actual cross-correspond-
ences between Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall recorded in this
paper conform to the type described.
(1) The first one, the "Selwyn text" (see above, pp. 219 ct seq.)
is difficult to estimate, since it consists of a number of more
or less similar passages in the two series of scripts. In each
case, taken alone, the similarity might certainly be put clown
to chance, but the cumulative effect of the large number of
similarities, together with the marked appropriateness of some
of the phrases to the circumstances, seem to show that
something beyond chance is at work. Yet we cannot say
with any confidence what central idea is intended to be
conveyed by this somewhat miscellaneous medley. If it was
Or. Sidgwick's text, Mrs. Verrall obtained only two rather

Haec :
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 387
vague paraphrases of it, and Mrs. Holland did not obtain it
at all. On the other hand, the text given by Mrs. Holland
might be regarded (for the reasons given in the full discus-
sion of it) as an attempt by Mr. Myers to give a test of
identity chosen by himself; and to this conjectural situation
Mrs. Verrall's contemporary phrase, "The question is answered
and the text given," is not inappropriate.
(2) The cross-correspondence of notes of music, on March
15th-22nd, 1905 (see p. 254) is, on the other hand, a very
simple one, and not in itself evidential of anything beyond
direct telepathy between the two automatists.
(3) "Not in the Electra " and "Henry was not mistaken"
(p. 310) are instances of remarks being made by one writer
which are distinctly appropriate to something which has been
said in the script of the other.
(4) " Eoden Noel" (p. 316) is an excellent illustration of
details given in one script which it would be very difficult
to refer to direct telepathy from the other ;
but, as explained
in the full account, the weak point here is the impossibility
of excluding the writers' subliminal knowledge of the facts
mentioned, in which case the whole might be put down to
subliminal association of ideas on both sides. Tor the train
of ideas in Mrs. Holland's case may conceivably have been
started by a subliminal recognition of the similarity between
Mrs. Verrall's verses and Koden Noel's poem.
(5) "Ave Eoma Immortalis " (p. 297) is the clearest case
of what I regard as a typical cross-correspondence, in that a
number of details of the picture, quite unintelligible to
herself, were given by Mrs. Verrall, while a single other
important detail, clinching the whole matter, was given by
Mrs. Holland, accompanied by a remark implying that Mrs.
Verrall had been purposely kept in the dark. Even here,
however, since Dr. Verrall saw Mrs. Verrall's first script soon
after its production, and associated it mentally with the picture,
there was one person who had in his mind the idea to be
conveyed, and it is therefore not impossible that Mrs. Holland
may have received it telepathically from him. If so, however,
why did she add " How could I make it any clearer without
giving her the clue ?
" Eor this certainly was not derived from
any idea at least consciously in Dr. Verrall's mind.
388 Alice Johnson. [part
(6) " Posilipo " (p. 334) is another case where Mrs.
Holland's script comments very appropriately on Mrs. Verrall's
—" M. (she says) saw a real place that last time, but she
has never seen the place itself." On the same day Mrs.
Verrall writes a description of Posilipo, which she has never
seen.
(7) " Eheu fugaces "
(p. 363) is a case where Mrs.
Holland's script sums up in one apt paraphrase an idea
repeated in several different forms by Mrs. Verrall.
(8) "Fawcett" (p. 341). In this case Mrs. Holland
obtained the name Fawcett eight days after Mrs. Verrall had
been led to it through planchette writing with Mrs. Forbes,
the planchette saying that Mrs. Holland must give it too.
Mrs. Holland connected the name—-no doubt through a natural
association of ideas—with Henry Fawcett, but gave some
correct details connected with the Fawcetts to whom Mrs.
Verrall's writing referred.
These cases, though by no means so numerous as we might
wish, are yet sufficiently so, I think, to form a basis for
discussion.
Probably the first point which will strike every careful
reader will be that evidence for mere connection between the
two series of scripts would be more satisfactorily provided by
identical statements than by similar or supplementary state-
ments ; for the odds against identical statements occurring in
two scripts are clearly much greater than the odds against
the occurrence of similar statements. And, of course, in
ordinary experiments in telepathy, we value complete suc-
cesses much more than partial ones, other things being
equal.
The whole amount of connection shown between the scripts
will, I think, be admitted to be beyond what could have
been produced by chance, and among the simpler cases are
some which may be called " complete successes." Thus the
"Scribe incident" (p. 283), the coincidental statement about
Sir Oliver Lodge's illness (p. 277), and the description of
Mrs. Forbes's dining-room (p. 329), by Mrs. Holland ;
and
Mrs. Verrall's coincidental statement about Carpaccio's St.
Ursula (p. 254); may all be described as successes complete
of their kind, since apparently there was success in what was
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 389
aimed at. On the other hand, the statement about " Mr.
Grove" and cancer (p. 279) may be described as an incomplete
success, since it was true of Mrs., not of Mr. Grove, and so
apparently came near, but fell short of, its aim.
The question then arises whether the cross-correspondences
should be regarded as cases of telepathy between the two
automatists—only partially successful ;
—or cases in which some
third agency, external to both of them, was endeavouring to
produce some rather different result.
Assuming that the controls are actually trying to communi-
cate some definite idea by means of two different automatists,
whom at the same time they are trying to prevent from
communicating telepathically with one another, what the
controls have to do is to express the factors of the idea in so
veiled a form that each writer indites her own share without
understanding it. Yet the expression must be so definite that,
when once the clue is found, no room is left for doubt as
to the proper interpretation.
It will be seen that, ex hypothesi, the idea must be pre-
vented from reaching the subliminal consciousness of the
automatists ;
yet we cannot be certain in any case that it has
been so prevented, as we can only interrogate their supraliminal
consciousnesses. It is conceivable, however, that the controls
are more capable than living persons of manipulating their
own telepathic faculties. Just as we in ordinary conversation
can say what we like and abstain from saying what we wish
not to say ; so it is possible that the controls can telepathically
convey certain things to the automatists, stopping short at
whatever point they choose, and thus excluding subliminal
comprehension of the underlying ideas.
Perhaps the most serious practical objection to the
hypothesis that the controls invented this special plan of
cross-correspondences would be that it might have been a
subliminal invention of Mrs. Verrall's, since it is on her script
that the hypothesis is chiefly based, and it is there that we
find the most complete exposition of it.
There are, however, a few indications of it in Mrs. Holland's
script also, quite independently of Mrs. Verrall's. Thus we
find in Mrs. Holland's script on September 21st, 1903, the
day on which the description of a room afterwards identified
2 b
390 Alice Johnson. [part
as Mrs. Verrall's dining-room was written (see p. 194), the
following
:
" There is no effort unavailing,
You fail—yet save another's failing,
One person alone does so little."
Again on November 7th, .1903, the day when the descrip-
tion of a man, probably Dr. Verrall, was given (see p. 186),
" The agent 1
is all alone, and that makes it hard."
See also the passages dated Dec. 1st and 5 th, 1903,
and Jan. 5th, 1904, quoted on p. 238 under the heading
" Co-operation between different sensitives," all these being
connected with the first cross-correspondence with Mrs. Verrall.
Again, on February 22nd, 1905 (for context see p. 246),
the control, complaining of the difficulties of communication,
remarks :
" The influence of my friends near at hand might
be able to combat this, but then thought-transference would
make yet another difficulty,"—that is, the script recognises
that what is desired is to transcend telepathy between the
living.
The most definite passage bearing on this point in Mrs.
Holland's script is the one already quoted in connection with
the cross-correspondence :
" Ave Roma immortalis," viz. " How
can I make it any clearer without giving her the clue ?
"
These passages are few in number, and—-except the last
—
are vague and rather indefinite. No special significance could
be attached to them if it were not that they seem, as far
as they go, to confirm the far more numerous and specific
statements in Mrs. Verrall's script.
Yet it may be noticed that all of them, except the one
occurring on February 22nd, 1905, are connected with evi-
dential or would-be evidential portions of the script,—portions
which there is some reason to attribute to an intelligence
external to Mrs. Holland's own mind. And this is of course
the strongest ground—indeed, the only ground—for attributing
these phrases also to an external intelligence.
Similarly, if we extract from Mrs. Verrall's script all the
passages which I take to relate to the theory of cross-
1
Mrs. Holland not being very familiar with psychical nomenclature some-
times uses this term almost in the meaning of "percipient." The context
here shows that it means the automatist.
lv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland. Chapter VII. 391
correspondences, and consider them apart from their context,
there is nothing evidential in them, for the theory expounded
is obviously not beyond Mrs. Verrall's inventive capacity,
though she did not grasp it at all at the time.
But most of the passages occur in close connection with
actual cross-correspondences and are clearly intended to relate
to them ;
they form, in fact, a sort of running commen-
tary on them. How, then, could Mrs. Verrall—from her
normal subliminal resources alone—have made remarks so
appropriate to facts unknown to her at the time ? For she
did not of course know of the cross-correspondences till some
time after they had occurred.
All the circumstances suggest, I think, that one and the
same intelligence, or group of co-operating intelligences, was
responsible both for the cross-correspondences and for the con-
temporary comments on them.
Nevertheless, for anything like an adequate proof of the
agency suggested, far more instances, and instances of a more
cogent kind than any included in this report, are obviously
needed. The evidence in regard to cross-correspondences here
adduced, though in my view well worth consideration, is slender
enough in proportion to the superstructure of hypothesis which
I have based on it. It is, in fact, so slender that I should
certainly not have ventured to bring forward such a hypothesis
now, were it not for the further evidence pointing in the same
direction in the more recent portions of Mrs. Holland's script,
with which I hope to deal later, and especially for the im-
portant series of cross-correspondences recently obtained between
Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Piper, Miss Verrall, and Mrs. Holland, which
will be described in Mr. Piddington's forthcoming report.

REVIEW.
The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism, fraudulent and genuine. By
Hereward Carrington. Illustrated, 12mo. Cloth. $2 net.
(Boston, U.S.A. : Herbert B. Turner & Co., 1907.)
This is an exceptionally interesting and instructive book by an
exceptionally qualified writer. Mr. Hereward Carrington's name
requires no introduction to readers of the S.P.R. Proceedings.
The aim and raison d'etre of his work the author sums up thus
:
"The investigations of the Society for Psychical Research," he
says, "... have demonstrated the fact that supernormal pheno-
mena do occur, but whether the physical phenomena are to be
considered as such is a question that remains still undecided." Mr.
Carrington accordingly divides his book into two parts. In the
first he deals with the fraudulent phenomena, the methods used to
produce spurious "manifestations" being exhaustively described; in
the second with the apparently genuine, i.e. with those incidents in
the literature of the subject for which the writer fails to find a
satisfactory explanation on normal lines. I regret to add that this
second part of the book is by far the shorter and less interesting.
Mr. Carrington seems to have quite an extraordinary knowledge
of conjuring and pseudo-mediumistic tricks, and throughout the four
hundred pages of his book he almost unceasingly opens up in this
direction such vistas, that the uninitiated reader's breath is simply
taken away. For my own part I must say that after a perusal of
his work I feel much more strongly than I ever did before that in
view of the boundlessness of human ingenuity —especially of the
misdirected kind—and of the unimaginable variety of the methods
used to produce the desired effects,—the evidence of the average
honest and intelligent observer (at least when dealing with the
American professional) is certainly of little weight. The conviction
even is beginning to dawn upon my mind that there may be
regions in which only exceptional evidence coming from peculiarly
LV.] Review. 393
able and previously trained eye-witnesses should be at all taken
into account. To leading members of the S.P.R. this is of course
no new conclusion ; but for my own part never did I feel more
inclined to share it than after studying Mr. Carrington's book.
After a few pages on some American celebrities of by-gone days,
and on Eusapia Paladino and Madame Blavatsky (pp. 3-18) Mr.
Carrington devotes a whole chapter (pp. 19-47) to a detailed
examination of the Slade-Zollner investigation. This he conclu-
sively and without difficulty shows to have presented many weak
points, which in fact are already so well known (see e.g. Podmore's
Modern Spiritualism, Vol. II., pp. 190-194) that they need no repeti-
tion. It is interesting, however, to note in this connection that one
of Zollner's experiments, or rather observations—the vanishing and
subsequent reappearance of a table—Mr. Carrington cannot explain
without having recourse to a visual hallucination as a possible
explanation (p. 28). The famous "knots on an endless cord," the
two wooden rings incident and other matters the author seems to
me to have disposed of very satisfactorily, though his criticisms do
not embrace everything Zollner has described (e.g. the appearance
of knots on two leathern bands, Transcendental Physics, p. 81).
But surely Mr. Carrington ought not to include in his negative
evidence (p. 40) Professor Fullerton's (of the Seybert Commission)
personal interviews with Fechner, Scheibner, Weber, and Zollner
in 1886, since the latter had died four years previously (in 1882).
Mr. Carrington must have glanced too hastily over Professor
Fullerton's account in the "Seybert Commission's Report," pp.
104-114.
After a chapter on the "Psychology of Deception "
(pp. 48-63),
illustrating some of the general methods in use with conjurers and
mediums, the writer proceeds to review the various categories of
fraudulent " manifestations " one after another. We are shown the
different devices used to produce fraudulent table-lifting (pp. 73-76),
raps (pp. 77-83), and so finally come to "slate-writing" (p. 84).
After briefly mentioning the story of Eglinton's " psychography
"
versus Mr. S. J. Davey's, Mr. Carrington takes us into all the
secrets of the American professional " slate-writer." The number
of the methods he describes is simply bewildering and the clever-
ness of some of them quite amazing. I will select one instance
only (p. 134).
"I shall now describe a slate-test in which writing is obtained
between examined and marked slates that are so sealed and fastened
394 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part
together that it would be an utter impossibility for the medium to
open the slates in the slightest degree. The slates are free from
writing or preparation of any kind when they are placed together,
and they are fastened by the sitter himself after a small piece of
chalk has been placed between them." The sitter then first screws
the frames of the slates together, not only at the corners but also
at other places. He then " covers the heads of these screws with
sealing wax, after which he proceeds to fasten or gum the frames
of the slates together all the way round with strips of sticking
plaster, securing these in place, and finally sealing the frames together
in several different places, placing his signet on the seals. If he
choose he may glue the wooden frames of the slates together
also." This operation has probably occupied many minutes ; but after
the slates have been held under the table for perhaps a minute,
and are opened and examined, a "message" is found upon the
inner surface of one of them—to the intense amazement of the
sitter, and, I may add, of the reader also.
In this case, it would appear, the piece of chalk (not slate pencil)
which had been placed between the slates is no ordinary chalk,
but is made of a compound of powdered chalk, water, glue, and
iron filings all blended together and allowed to become dry and
hard. " When the slates are placed under the table the medium
extracts from his sleeve or elsewhere a magnet, and with this he
traces a series of letters on the under side of the bottom slate in
mirror writing. The iron filings of the mixture will follow the
magnet, and the chalk will write on the slate in the regular manner.
The medium locates the piece of chalk in the first instance by
tipping the slate at an angle so that the chalk will run into one
corner. He first of all places the magnet in that corner and drags
the bit of chalk to the middle of the slate before proceeding to
write out the message." Surely after this, as the French say, il n'y
a plus qu'a tirer Vichelle.
I have found in this chapter no reference to those few cases
when sitters are alleged to have seen the pencil write at a slate-
-vvriting seance (the most notable evidence being that of Professor
Elliott Coues and Mr. Emmette Coleman with Mrs. Francis, Eeligio-
Philosophical Journal, Feb. 27th, 1892, and M. "Harry Allis " with
Slade, Dr. Gibier's L'Analyse des Choses), but I confess Mr. Carrington's
exposures are so crushing and his criticisms so destructive that I
.lack courage to lay much stress on these few enigmatic incidents.
In chapter VII. (pp. 1 43-167) we meet with various "rope-tying"
i,v.] Review. 395
tests, past and present, and old acquaintances such as Miss A. E.
Fay and the Davenports (Mr. Carrington has, by the way, unearthed
an account by Houdin of the Davenports' performances, which,
extraordinary as it may appear, had escaped the knowledge of so
wide a reader as Mr. Podmore) ; in chapter VIII., with such things
as "spirit-posts," "spirit-sacks and handcuffs" (pp. 168-185); and
perfectly dazed with the writer's extraordinary and sometimes, I
confess, hardly credible revelations of what trickery alone can do,
we come to "holding tests" (p. 186). This chapter is of peculiar
interest to me ; the reader will presently see why.
Mr. Carrington shows the various ways in which the medium or
conjurer can manage to get one hand free :
(a) When hands are joined round the table and in mutual contact
through each sitter's little fingers.
(h) When the sitter's hands are in contact soi-disant with the two
hands of the medium, he (or she) substituting, in fact, one of his
(or her) hands for two (turning it so as to lie across the sitter's
two hands).
(c) When the sitter who is on the medium's right-hand side
grasps his right wrist, while the medium himself grasps the left-hand
sitter's wrist.
(d) When two " investigators " and the medium are sitting side
by side, under cover of a curtain pinned across them and attached
just helow their necks—the medium pretending to grasp his
neighbour's arm with both hands, whilst managing, in fact, to get
one hand free. 1
Such are, according to Mr. Carrington, the main methods of " hand-
holding" which permit "escape." But I have not found in this chapter
(or in others) any evidence showing me that a medium can get his
hand free when both of them are securely held by the sitters in the
proper sense of the word. In fact, it is obvious that this method of
control is evaded by the profession.
1
To do this " sometimes . . . the medium has concealed in his right hand
a piece of sheet lead about two inches square," which when "he places his
right hand over the arm of the sitter he simply bends . . . round the arm of
his victim, and he is then free to remove his hand at any time without fear
of detection." And to make the illusion of continued contact quite perfect
"a further improvement was made. A spring clasp was used to each end of
which was soldered a pox-tion of a hand, the thumb on one end and the four
fingers on the other. These were made of rubber, and when the spring clip
was opened and the fingers and thumb clasped on opposite sides of the arm,
the illusion was perfect" (p. 195). Truly one stands aghast at such cleverness.
396 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part
Now at the seances of Stepan Sambor, a Russian professional
physical medium who died some years ago, his hands were almost
invariably held, i.e. grasped in such a way as to make release in any
of the ways suggested by Mr. Carrington impossible. And never did
Sambor in my experience object to this kind of holding.
And yet I undoubtedly did in the course of my 105 sittings with
him observe things which could be explained only on the supposition
that one of his hands had been released and which no machinery of
any kind nor collusion would do. I refer chiefly to incidents which
seemed to indicate "passage of matter through matter," such as
chairs being threaded on the medium's arm without his hands having
been (apparently) released for a second.
Apart from this, the very fact of a professional medium allowing
from the very beginning and throughout his career this method of
control (which seems to be so carefully avoided by his colleagues,
not excepting the most famous, such as Eusapia) affords in my eyes
to a certain extent the presumption that he may have possessed some
authentic "power" after all.
To return to Sambor's "chair-threading." I made a special study
of it at the time and described my experiments in detail in the
Annales des Sciences Psychiques for 1900 and 1902, and elsewhere; and
though were I now to rewrite those articles of mine they would
assume quite a different appearance, the fact remains that, under
very good conditions of hand-holding, we repeatedly and with different
sitters did witness this curious fact—of the medium's arm getting in
some mysterious way inside the opening in the back of a chair (not
his own) when his neighbours were perfectly convinced they had not
released his hands for a quarter of a second.
So much remains to my mind unshaken to the present day. And
before believing that trickery, in the usual sense of the word, was
possible under those conditions, I shall require an undoubted conjurer
to do the same thing for me. Until this is done, \ prefer to admit
that some kind of suggestion was at work, —suggestion not expressed
in words, and perhaps even unconsciously exerted by the "entranced"
medium. 1
1
This conclusion seems to me decidedly supported by some isolated incidents
connected with these curious chair experiments and which would point to tactile
hallucinations more or less induced at the very least. Here is one such case.
Mme. Yudenitch, a lady spiritualist personally known to me, writes to me on
March 11/24, 1904 :
"As for the chair it happened thus : I was sitting next to the medium when
suddenly the chairs were pulled away from under me, the medium, and the
LV.] Review. 397
So much to show that even Mr. Carrington fails to explain every-
thing.
In chapters X.-XIV. (pp. 206-276), dealing with "spirit-photo-
graphy " and materialisation, we still have the same unending tale
of gruesome fraud all along the line. A few pages (pp. 224-230) on
" paraffin mould-tests " should be read in connection with the chapters
in M. Aksakoffs Animismus unci Spiritism/US, devoted to the same
subject. Of a well-known case to which M. Aksakoff (unfortunately,
I think) attached his name, Mr. Carrington very satisfactorily disposes.
It is the famous incident of the " dematerialisation " of Mrs. D'Esper
ance's legs at Helsingfors in 1893. Mr. Carrington conclusively shows
that this "phenomenon" admits of an absurdly easy explanation
(pp. 235-236 ; see also Proceedings of the American S.P.R., Vol. I,
Part I., pp. 131-168), and thus leaves it literally without a leg to
stand upon.
Methods used in simulating "gradual materialisation," as if from
the floor, are described (pp. 257, 258), also various ways of smuggling
" spirit-clothes " into the cabinet. Much stress is sometimes laid by
spiritualists on accounts of test seances for materialisation at which
"forms" dressed in white flowing robes appeared after the medium
himself (or herself) had been subjected to a thorough searching.
When one reads, however, that these " robes " are made of such fine
material as to find room in a dummy watch, a purse, a letter, or even
in a hollow boot heel (p. 250), one may be excused for not attaching
undue importance to such " searchings."
It should be noted, however, that Mr. Carrington thinks it
" conceivable that such a thing as genuine materialisation exists as
a fact in nature" (p. 237), and refers in this connection to Sir W.
Crookes's experiments with D. D. Home, and even to M. Charles
Richet's recent sittings at Algiers, which he thinks "most extra-
ordinary ; " why, he does not explain, since, apart from the name of
the chief witness, the sittings in question do not seem to have
gentleman who was sitting on his other side, so that we had to get up, and the
chairs behind us were somewhat moved about ; then the medium began to move
aside his hand, together with mine, and at this moment I felt one chair hanging
on my arm and so stated to those present, who advised me to [bring the lower
part of my arm close to the upper part]. I had hardly done so when a second
chair appeared on the same arm (the feeling was as if my arm had been lightly
struck with a wooden object). Having squeezed both chairs I experienced the
strange feeling as if their backs, which were upon my arm, had parted in two, and
then [the chairs] fell on the floor at once, thus freeing my arm."
Curious, is it not ? And this is not an altogether unique experience.

presented anything exceptional so far as "conditions" were con-
cerned, and, as is well known, many suspicious circumstances have
transpired since.
The three following chapters, ending Part I., on " Sealed letter-
reading," "Mind-reading performances," and "Trance and test-
seances," are, strictly speaking, out of place in a book devoted to
" physical phenomena," but with this reservation are nevertheless
among the most instructive. In the first of these we see again
that seemingly the most perfect "tests" almost invariably fall an
easy prey to the medium's cunning. This never-ending tale of
precautions baffled, however elaborate and ingenious, ends by pro-
ducing on the disheartened reader's mind an impression of perfect
hopelessness. What : if such " conditions " and " tests " are of no
avail, can any experiments be of any use 1 Scepticism in answer to
this question is legitimate. But before one has had time to pause
and consider a possible solution, Mr. Carrington takes us two steps
further into the same extraordinarily fertile though unwholesome
region. In the chapter on mind-reading performances (291-311),
after a few pages on genuine " muscle-reading," we are treated to an
exposure of the methods used by professional mind-readers on the
public stage ; and here I stand bewildered again. Let the reader
consider, for instance, the following passage (p. 305)
:
" I next give a very clever test, in which the assistant stands in
front of a black-board, with chalk in her hands, and writes upon
the board whatever number, date, card, etc., is whispered into the
performer's ear when he is amongst the audience, not a word being
spoken throughout this test, and it is obvious that there is no
communication of any sort between performer and assistant. The
performer moves freely amongst the audience, the only condition
required being that absolute silence be maintained."
In such performances, it appears " the assistant upon the stage
breathes deeply and regularly, so that the performer can see the
movement of her shoulders from where he stands, care being taken
however not to overdo this part of the performance and render the
movement noticeable to any person in the audience. The performer-
starts his assistant by making some slight noise, and from that
instant the silent counting begins. . . . After she (the assistant)
has counted up to a certain number, the number required (i.e. after
she has taken that number of breaths), the performer interrupts
her breathing, and the assistant knows the number to place upon
the board. The counting then begins again from the moment the
LV.] Review. 399
sound of chalk ceases to mark the blackboard —the performer again
interrupting the breathing at the next number or letter, as the case
may. be, by again making a slight sound or movement. This
process is continued until the whole message is communicated, thu
assistant writing down each word or figure in turn, no word being
spoken throughout the entire performance."
But it appears that there is another method also—and even far
superior. " Instead of the breathing being necessary, the performer
and his assistant have substituted a method of counting mentally and
together. It is a known fact that the beats for common time are
always the same in music, therefore, with little practice, it is easy
for two persons starting on a given signal to count at the same
time and rate, and when another signal is given to stop, and of
course they will both have arrived at the same number. The
performer and his assistant count together mentally until they are
sure that they both count in exactly the same time, when the
hardest portion of this method will have been overcome. The
signals of when to stop and when to commence have now to be
learned. . . . Suppose the date of a coin is to be trans-
mitted. It is generally understood that most coins begin with
the figure 1, and that much may be taken for granted. The
performer stands up at the blackboard, his assistant being at the
opposite side of the stage and awaits her replies. She begins
:
'The first figure I see is a 1.' From the instant she has ceased
speaking, both she and the performer begin counting together.
Suppose the next number is an 8. The performer waits until he
(and, consequently, his assistant) has mentally counted eight breaths
before he marks upon the board, when he writes the figure 1 as
directed. The assistant now knows that the next number is eight,
and so states. Before marking down the 8, however, the performer
waits until they have both counted up to the next number on the
coin, say 9. After mentally counting nine, then, the performer
writes down the 8 previously given, and the assistant hearing the
sound of the chalk knows the number next in order, and so on
indefinitely. Both performer and his assistant keep just '
one
ahead ' throughout : the sound of the chalk on the blackboard being
the signal for when to stop and when to commence" (pp. 306-7).
Slight variations of the method will do for numbers on bank-
notes, etc.
In the chapter on "Trance, test seances," etc., ending Part I.,
we read (pp. 312-318) of the various devices used to get information
400 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part
about personal matters connected with possible sitters ; of
" brotherhoods " of mediums, each member of those organisations
binding himself to turn into the "public fund" any information he
may obtain about sitters, their deceased friends and relatives; of
"Blue Books" (containing as many as seven thousand names for one
town alone) circulated in great secrecy among members of these
brotherhoods, etc.
Part II. of Mr. Carrington's book we can, unfortunately, go
through much quicker. Believing, as he does, that there may be
in nature some genuine mediumistic physical phenomena after all
(and he again, I fail to understand why, includes " trance " and
Mrs. Piper in this category), Mr. Carrington proceeds to give us
specimens of cases of " raps," " telekinesis," and the like, which he
thinks convincing (pp. 340-371). He will permit me to say that I
do not consider his lists altogether satisfactory. All references
to Jacolliot's experiments with his fakir I would have omitted
altogether. Then there is Sir William Crookes and his statements
on the various raps he observed with Mrs. Fox-Jencken. These
passages have already been quoted ad nauseam, and reproduced as
they are without any further additional details, in view again of
all the various "incidents" which have occurred since Sir William
wrote the lines in question (some 35 years ago), these brief state-
ments, even from so high an authority, carry now to the mind
little conviction. Such is at least my impression. On the other
hand, M. Maxwell's cases quoted on pp. 342-345 are distinctly very
good—or at least some of them are —and look encouraging. We
want only more of such experiments, but I am afraid a good man}'
more, to settle the question in the affirmative—and it would be
once for all !
I regret to note that in the chapter on " telekinesis " we meet
(p. 364) Jacolliot and Covindasamy again, but we see no reference
either to Count de Gasparin and Professor Thury, to Sub-
Committee Number I. of the London Dialectical Society, or to Dr.
Dariex's excellent case (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VII., pp. 194-198).
Turning to D. D. Home (p. 372), Mr. Carrington begins by
asserting somewhat too emphatically, I am afraid, that fraud was
never detected at any of Home's seances, " nor was it even
suspected (!) on any occasion," also that "he insisted upon as much
light as possible on all occasions." We are also told a little further
on that Sir William Crookes's accordion tests took place "in full
light" (p. 376). Such inaccuracies are distinctly unpleasant to meet
LV.] Review. 401
with in a scientific work like Mr. Carrington's. I strongly suspect
that the amount of light admitted at most of Home's seances was
poor, and I beg to refer Mr. Carrington in this connection to
some passages in Sir. W. Crookes's "Notes of seances with D. D.
Home" in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VI., pp. 98-127. I also think that
those who have had a large experience of seances, especially " light
"
ones, will agree with me that at a certain point too little light may
be worse, so far as observation is concerned, than unpretentious
darkness! Suspicious circumstances were undoubtedly observed at
Home's seances (see Mr. Merrifield's evidence in S.P.R. Journal, May,
1903, pp. 76-78, and compare his account of the seance in question
with the author's description of some feats of Monck's on
pp. 246-24 7). In saying this, I distinctly repudiate all idea of
casting doubt on the whole of Home's phenomena, but merely wish
to protest against unnecessary exaggerations.
There is one of Home's manifestations which I have long thought
to be one of the most enigmatic of all, not less perhaps than the
"elongations," " levitations," and "fire-tests" which Mr. Carrington
discusses at some length, and yet there is no reference to it in his
chapter on Home at all, though he just mentions it elsewhere
(p. 237) when speaking of the possibility of genuine materialisation.
It is the fact recorded by many observers (Sir W. Crookes and
Count Alexis Tolstoy, a distinguished Russian writer and poet,
among many others) of the gradual melting away of the " spirit-
hands " in the sitter's hand when grasped. I do not believe that
such a feat has ever been attempted by conjurers (no trace of
anything of the kind is to be found at any rate in Mr. Carrington's
work), and, until this is done, I think that prima facie there is in
this evidence for something "supernormal." Tactile hallucination
is, of course, not excluded in such cases, but the very fact of the
inducing of such tactile hallucinations with different observers not
hypnotised is very interesting ; and when we read of the undoubtedly
objective movements of objects performed by apparently similar
"spirit-hands" at Home's sittings on other occasions, we see
that the hallucination theory itself becomes a trifle more complicated.
It should be added that Mr. Carrington repudiates this theory as
applied to Home's manifestations (p. 393).
With Mrs. Piper (two pages only in chapter XXII.) I will not
concern myself, merely taking the liberty of reminding the reader
that the reflections and criticisms suggested to me by this famous
case in my "Appendix" to my Russian translation of Mr. Podmore's
402 Count Peruvsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part
" Modern Spiritualism " were excellently summarized by Dr. Leaf
in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIX., pp. 402-404.
Before concluding, I wish to emphasise my conviction of the very
great usefulness and practical importance to "Psychical Research"
of Mr. Carrington's work—or rather of the first part of it. As an
exposer of conjuring and " mediumistic " devices he in my opinion
stands unsurpassed, and there can be no doubt that his volume
has dealt professional mediumship a most sensible, I should perhaps
say a crushing, blow. It is true that the corporation has already
sustained many blows, and shows no sign of finally quitting the
public stage. Human credulity (with special reference to Spiritualistic
credulity) is in fact unfathomable, and will, I am afraid, always
prove so. But surely after closing the Physical Phenomena of
Spiritualism, one can hardly resist the conclusion that the case for
such phenomena, as produced by American professional mediums of
the present day, is almost hopeless.
But physicians are not justified in leaving without examination
and help a patient reputed or even positively known to be in a
hopeless state. And it seems to me that Psychical Researchers are
precisely in the physicians' position. As researchers they are bound
to investigate and study, even when there is very little chance of
their getting anything on the positive side. If they refuse, they
cease to be Psychical Researchers. I do not mean by this that any
one who claims to be a materialising or slate-writing medium has
a right to the Society's attention. Surely not. But I think that
to leave without examination all the " manifestations " of professional
mediums because a great many of them were exposed at one time
or another, would not be a wise policy. Of course, only evidence
coming from specially qualified persons should be given a serious
hearing.
And now may I be allowed a short digression —personal but not
without general interest'*
There is one source of possible error in the same region to which
Mr. Carrington has hardly referred, I think, in his book and to
which I wish to call the reader's attention. It is practical joking,
of very bad taste no doubt, on the part of one or other of the sitters.
I emphasise : it is anonymous practical joking, merely for the fun
of the thing—which may, in fact, remain unknown to the medium,
—
he not being in conscious collusion. It seems to me quite possible
that such a hypothesis may account for more than one "mediumistic"
mystery.
LY.] Review. 403
For my own part I am inclined to think, alas ! that such is the
prosaic cause of some of the best things I saw some years ago with
Sambor, and later on with three non-professional mediums, including
Luba Morosoff, the " Vladikavkaz girl," whose (Poltergeist) phenomena
created a certain stir in the Russian press in the spring of ] 904.
For among the manifestations which I then observed there were
several which the medium could hardly have produced unaided, and
there was at least one with which she absolutely could not have
been concerned : a Greek tenth century (I think) coin of unknown
origin suddenly falling down on the floor in my study (where we
had just been sitting) when Luba Morosoff was in a different part
of the lodgings. Previous preparation a la Meb (Podmore's Modern
Spiritualism, Vol. II., p. 324), was absolutely out of the question.
It should be added that in all these cases the "circle" was not a
promiscuous one, but more or less formed by myself and composed
of persons seriously interested, of good social or official position,
some of them sufficiently sceptical ; a very good circle indeed, which
seemed to offer every guarantee.
And yet a terrible suspicion entered then and still remains in my
mind that a certain member of this circle (very well known to me,
and with whom I have long been on the best of terms), a very
pleasant, intelligent and gifted gentleman, did simply dupe us
systematically and throughout.
My suspicions (shared by several other members of the circle)
were aroused first of all by the fact that our seances were remark-
ably successful if M. X. was present (and sitting close to the
medium) and were dismal failures when he was absent. By a pro-
cess of elimination and comparison we soon arrived at the conviction
that we could not suspect any one else. And after the Greek coin
incident our suspicions grew so irresistible that I thought it best
not to conceal them from X. himself.
I do not wish to minimise the fact either that he did not appear
particularly astonished or offended at my question, or that he gave
me repeatedly and apparently without any hesitation his word of
honour that neither at this nor at any other seance did he ever
cheat us.
This of course precluded all further discussion. Our mediums
vanished from the scene, and here the matter stands to the present
day. We have no positive proof that X. did deceive us ; we have
only somewhat suspicious circumstances (both the one I have men-
tioned and others of later origin, but, I repeat, not decisive). Socially
404 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part lv.]
speaking, I have no right whatever to doubt his word. And so i
ought to have no other alternative but to swallow almost every variety
of "physical phenomena" vouched for by Spiritualists, including
" apports " which were of especial frequency. And yet, with all due
respect to X., I hesitate, and so do still other members of the circle.
But see what this practically, and independently of the question
whether X. told me the truth or not, amounts to. For years I had
pursued my investigations, always hoping to see at last something
which the medium absolutely could not have simulated. There was
generally a loop-hole. At last I seemed to have got what I wanted.
In my own trusted circle, under very good conditions, I observed
"manifestations," some of which seemed really and truly out of the
medium's reach. But it was only to find myself in face of an
altogether new problem. My suspicions as to the part played by X.
may be unfounded after all. But, alas ! so far as my personal con-
viction is concerned, nearly everything—Sambor's chairs excepted
—
has to be begun anew. This is the sad moral of the story.
Another remark, and a last one. Let it be noted that if X, did
dupe us, our suspicions were aroused chiefly because he overdid his
part. If he had confined himself to movements of objects and
"touches," we should not have suspected foul play, provided that
the medium could not have done such things himself. It was chiefly
the stream of "apports" that we could not withstand. Otherwise
everything would have gone on quite smoothly, and we should have
enjoyed to the present day the bliss of belief. Let possible practical
jokers remember this !

THE ALLEGED MIRACULOUS HAILSTONES OF
EEMIREMONT.
By M. Sage.
[The events described in this paper took place on May 26 th,
1907. They seem to have attracted but little notice at the
time, and it was not until the early part of the year 1908
that any information about them reached us. Later, a foreign
member of the Society drew our attention to a more detailed
account in La Croix, and kindly offered to pay the expenses
of whatever investigation into the matter might then be found
possible.
We were fortunate in being able to secure the services of
one of our Honorary Associates, Monsieur M. Sage, who visited
Eemiremont in September, 1908, and spent some time there
collecting information and evidence. We give below his Eeport
on the case, together with the documentary evidence which he
obtained.

Voici le compte-rendu, aussi exact cpie possible et d'apres les
notes prises au moment meme, de l'enquete qu'au nom de la
Societe vous m'avez demande de faire a Eemiremont, sous-
406 M. Sage. [part
prefecture du departement des Vosges, a propos de l'affaire dite
des " grelons-medailles." D'apres les dires actuels du elerge\ qui
se base sur les affirmations de nombreux t^moins, un grand
nombre de grelons tombes le 26 mai 1907 auraient 6te" la
reproduction d'une medaille de Notre-Dame du Tresor, frappee
a l'occasion du Couronnement de cette madone (Fig. 1, facing
p. 423).
N.-D. du Tresor est une statue en bois de cedre conservee
en l'eglise paroissiale de Eemiremont. Sa valeur artistique est
mediocre a. mes yeux, mais je suis sur ce point tout a, fait
incompetent. En tout cas on ne peut apprecier que la tete
de la mere et celle de l'enfant, car tout le restant des deux
corps, s'il existe, est recouvert d'un vetement triangulaire en
etoffe rayee d'or. Depuis mai 1907 la tete de la madone
est surmontee d'un diademe. L'ensemble me rappelle quelque
antique idole on quelque icone byzantine. Les lignes de l'image,
en tout cas, sont tres simples
:
1
c'est la un detail qu'il faut
avoir present a l'esprit pour cornprendre comment a pu se
former l'illusion qui va nous occuper.
D'apres l'histoire ou la legende, cette statue fut donnee par
Charlemagne, a son retour dTtalie, a un couvent de femmes
situe" sur une montagne (le Saint-Mont) au sud-est et non loin
de l'emplacement actuel de Eemiremont. Le 13 aout 910,
les religieuses, fuyant devant les Huns, vinrent s'installer dans
la bourgade, berceau du Eemiremont actuel, emportant la statue
entre autres. Dans la conversation que j'ai eue avec Mr
le
curd de Etienne, celui-ci a remarque que la grele, miracu-
leuse a. ses yeux, de 1907 avait suivi le meme trajet que
N.-D. du Tresor, lors de son transferement en 910; il y voyait
une preuve de plus que cette grele etait surnaturelle : c'est
peut-etre abuser un peu du droit qu'a chacun de nous de faire
des rapprochements. (Lire a ce propos sa deposition.)
Depuis les origines jusqua nos jours le peuple de Eemire-
mont et des environs croit que N.-D. du Tresor a le pouvoir
d'arreter les catamite's, telles qu'incendies ou tremblements de
terre, ou plus simplement de faire pleuvoir quand la secheresse
se prolonge, ou de ramener le soleil quand la pluie tombe

est une exacte reproduction de celle dite du couronnement. C'est celle-la
que les temoins pretendent avoir vue dans les grelons.

pendant trop longtemps. Pour obtenir ce merveilleux r6sultat
on " expose " la statue. Lisez dans la Notice historique (docu-
ment N° 1) page 415, ce qu'il faut entendre par cette exposition.
II invporte cUs maintenant de lien se souvenir que depuis des
siecles, dans I'esprit populaire, la statue en question est associie
avec les intempiries. It doit y avoir la certainement un des
iUmcnts qui ont engendre' Villusion du 26 mai 1907.
Certains pretendent que le clerge exploite dans un but de
lucre cette croyance (n'ecrivons pas superstition) populaire
;
mais je n'ai pas recueilli la moindre preuve que ce soit la
autre chose qu'une malveillante insinuation.
Le 12 mai 1682 un tremblement de terre £branla forte-
ment la ville de Eemiremont ; un grand nombre de maisons
s'ecroulerent. Pendant plusieurs jours le peuple campa au
milieu des prairies. Alors on porta processionnellement N.-D. du
Trdsor et, d'apris la tradition popidaire, le fliau cessa aussitdt.
Le chapitre de Remiremont Jit le vazu que, a perpUuiU, une
procession de Notre-Damc aurait lieu chaque anne"e le plus
proche dimanche du 12 mai, afin de pre"server a I'avenir la ville
d'tm pareil tremblement de terre. (Voir la. Notice historique,
pages 415-6.)
Depuis lors cette procession, dite du Tremblement, a eu lieu
tous les ans.
Le cure actuel de Eemiremont, Mr
l'archipretre Vuillemin,
a toujours eu une devotion profonde pour la inadone du pays.
" Oui, monsieur, je l'aime beaucoup," m'a-t-il dit k moi-meme.
Son vceu le plus cher fut toujours d'en obtenir le couronnement.
Certes, il serait facile de gloser la-dessus et sur beaucoup
d'autres details de l'histoire que je raconte : un esprit scienti-
fique tombe d'etonnement en stupefaction. Mais il convient ici
de constater et non pas de s'abandonner a de faciles ironies.
En France, et dans d'autres pays aussi sans doute, les manifes-
tations de I'esprit religieux sont souvent, beaucoup trop souvent,
dignes du fetichisme le plus grossier.
Enfin S.S. Pie X, comblant les vceux de Mr
l'abb6
Vuillemin, ordonna le Couronnement ofnciel et liturgique de
N.-D. du Tresor. " On entcnd par la, disait le Rulletin
Paroissial de Eemiremont, facte par lequel le Souverain Pontife,
a la prttrc qui lux est adressie, be'nit et impose, par un de'Ugue'
special, une riche couronne a une statue vSne'rable."
408 M. Sage. [part
Dans sa joie Mr
l'archipretre Vuillemin fit tout ce qu'il put
pour dormer a la ceremonie de l'eclat et de la splendeur.
Cette cdremonie eut lieu le lundi de Pentecote (20 mai 1907).
Cinq eveques y assistaient : Mgr
Foucault, de S* Di£; Mgr
Dubois, de Verdun ; Mgr
Labenche, de Belley ; Msr
Chapelier,
protonotaire apostolique ; et en fin Mgr
Turinaz, de Nancy et
de Toul. Ce dernier, connu pour sa combativite, etait alors
dans les plus mauvais termes avec le gouvernement de la
Eepublique. Enfin Mr
l'abbe Vuillemin avait fait reporter,
toujours dans le but de donner plus d'eclat aux fetes, la
Procession du Tremblement, k cette meme date du 20 mai 1907.
Mais le Conseil Municipal craignit des troubles dans la rue,
les partis clerical et anticlerical 6tant tres montes l'un contre
l'autre ; et par un arrete en date du 13 mai 1907, il defendit
la Procession. (Voir le resume" des motifs de l'interdiction qui
m'a ete remis par Mr
le secretaire de la mairie de Itemiremont,
document N° 2.) Grande colere au camp des clericaux ! La
procession ne put avoir lieu qu'a, l'interieur de l'eglise.
Pour se rendre compte de l'6tat des esprits, il faut lire le
Discours prononcS dans l'eglise de Itemiremont a I'occasion du
Couronnemcnt de N.-D. du Tre'sor, -par Mr
VahbS Rollin. Ce
discours est plein de paroles violentes et mauvaises 1
que meme
un sceptique entend avec douleur et repugnance du haut de
la cbaire. Ce discours net pas du etre sans influence sur
Villusion qui devait se produire le dimanche suivant'} L'un des
1
""Votre foi court les plus grands perils. L'enfer semble mettre en ligne ses
dernieres reserves et tenter un supreme effort pour en flnir avec le christianisme.
L'inipiete prend ses elbats et s'etale en plein jour, avec un cynisme que les plus
mauvais siecles de notre histoire n'avaient pas connu. Voltaire n'est pas mort, et
son rire affreux grince dans toutes les voix de la presse antireligieuse. Nos places
publiques sont profanees par les statues de ces bandits de la parole et de la plume
dont le peuple ignorait les noms et les ceuvres, et peu s'en est fallu que, dans un
acces de rage sacrilege on ne donnat le nom de Judas l'lscariote a l'un des
Boulevards de Paris ! C'est une frenesie, mais une fr^nesie contagieuse."
2 " Quand les religieuses du Saint-Mont, fuyant devant les Barbares, vinrent
s'abattre, comme une volee de colombes efi'arees, dans la petite bourgade de
Remiremont, elles instituerent, en souvenir de leur epouvante, une messe annuelle
dite 'la messe piteuse,' qu'elles chantaient a voix basse et tremblante. Eh!
bien, mes Freres, d'autres Barbares, sortis, non des forets d'un pays lointain, mais
des antres d'une secte Wnebreuse, ont jure de nous reduire a la messe piteuse, a
un culte piteusement amoindri, celebre furtivement dans les transes d'un terro-
risme administratif.
"II se peut que Dieu permette cette epreuve. Elle n'aura qu'un temps si nous

ternoins que j'ai vus, M1'
Claude, le concierge cle la filature
Schwartz, m'a affirme" de vive voix que des ce jour il avait
prophetise " que Eemiremont serait grele et que l'image de
N.-D. du Tresor serait sur les grelons." Si cela etait vrai, nous
assisterions la a l'incubation —si je puis m'exprimer airisi
—
de l'illusion qui nous occupe. Mais ce temoin ne m'inspire pas
pleine confiance ; il est de bonne foi, certes, mais il parle
beaucoup trop pour ne pas confondre souvent dans ses souvenirs
ce qui est anterieur et ce qui est posterieur a un moment donne.
Nous arrivons au dimanche 26 mai 1907. Un orage survient
vers le soir, accompagne de grele. Je ne m'attarderai pas a
decrire cette grele : on en trouvera plusieurs descriptions, a peu
pres concordantes, dans les documents annexes au present compte-
rendu. Voici le passage saillant de celle qui est contenue dans
le Eapport adresse' a Mgr
Foucault, eveque de Saint-Die. C'est
ce " rapport " qua publie le journal La Croix. (Voir le Supple-
ment au N° de mai 1908, du Bulletin paroissial cle Remiremont,
document N° 3.)
" A la pluie qui tombe d'aboi'd avec abondance succede une
grele ordinaire, suivie bientot d'une seconde grele plus grosse
que la premiere. Elle massacre les verandahs, brise les carreaux,
mais, chose singuliere ! ellc respccte les Ugumes et les flcurs des
jardins. L'orage enfin se termine par une troisieme grele, dont
les grelons sont extraordinaires par leur grosseur, leur forme et
leur maniere de tomber. Beaucoup ont la grosseur d'un ceuf
cle poule ; ils sont ovoides et plats sur une de leurs faces ; ils
tombent lentement, lourdement et a distance les tons des autres
"
(op. cit. page 86).
Ceux qui croient aux grelons miraculeux aiment a insister
sur deux points. Tous l'ont fait avec moi.
(1°) Les grelons respecterent les legumes et les fleurs des
jardins ! Mais Eemiremont, pays de prairies et de forets, a
savons prier, prier le divin Cceur de Jesus qui a pris droit de cite sur notre sol,
prier Marie, qui n'oublie pas son royaume de France et qui se plait encore a y
guerir les incurables. Chers pelerins des Vosges, accourus pour honorer Notre-
Danie du Tresor, ne restez pas etrangers a cette croisade de prieres qui entraine
aux pieds de Marie tous les cceurs preoccupes du salut de la France. Jadis elle a
sauve cette cite des d^sastres d'un tremblement de terre. Des fleaux plus
terribles nous menacent. La terre tremble sous nos pieds, de sourds gronde-
ments presagent des catastrophes prochaines, juste cfaatinient de notre egoiste
insouciance a l'egard des interets de Dieu.''
410 M. Sage. [part
tres peu de jardins et presque pas de culture. La trainee de
grele, orientee du nord-ouest au sud-est, n'eut pas plus de
4 kilometres de long sur 4 ou 500 metres de large : elle put
tres bien ne rencontrer pas beaucoup de jardins sur son chemin.
(2°) Quoique tres lourds, les gros grelons tombaient lentement,
" comme de la neige." II s'agit evidemment ici d'une illusion
d'optique. La vitesse exacte de la chute n'a etc" et ne pouvait
etre mesuree par personne. Ces grelons tombaient verticalement
dans une atmosphere tranquille ; le regard pouvait les suivre
:
de la la sensation d'un mouvement lent. Leur force vive devait
etre neanmoins considerable, puisque, de l'aveu de tous, ils
s'enfoncaient profondement dans le sol ou volaient en Eclats
quaud ils rencontraient un corps dur.
Le lendemain matin (pas avant) le bruit se repand clans la
ville de Eemiremont que " N.-D. du TrSsor Matt sur les grelons."
Le clerge tout d'abord accueille la nouvelle avec scepticisme.
Mais bientot, sous la pression, a, ce que plusieurs m'ont afhrme,
de certaines devotes riches et influentes, il s'6meut davantage,
questionne et, enfin, en refere a l'dveque, lequel ordonne une
enquete.
Alors, du haut de la chaire ou par invitation particuliere
(voir la deposition de M1'
Andre), on demande a ceux qui ont
vu de venir apporter leur deposition au presbytere.
Un detail qui a sa tres grande importance, c'est que parmi
les temoins ne figure aucun rnembre du clerge de Eemiremont,
ni aucune religieuse. Sauf Mr
le cure de S* Etienne, aucun
n'a rien vu. Mr
Tabbed Minod m'en a donne l'affirmation ecrite
(voir le document N° 4).
J'ai commence; mes demarches par une visite a la cure, car
aucune enquete n'etait possible si le clerge ne s'y pretait pas.
Mr
l'archipretre Vuillemin m'accueillit d'abord avec une certaine
humeur, il pretexta que son temps etait tres mesure. Sans
doute il me prenait pour un journaliste. Mais, apres un peu
de conversation, il devint plus aitnable. Cet homme est un
vieillard d'environ 69 ans ; certainement il est un bon pasteur,
charitable et devoue, mais il est aussi etranger qu'un homme
peut l'etre a la critique et a la psychologic Quand on abonde
dans son sens, sa physionomie s'illumine de plaisir, mais elle
devient dure et obstinee quand on hasarde, non pas une con-
tradiction, mais une simple objection. Bientot survint Mr
Tabbe
-
lvi.] The Alleged Miraculous Hailstones of Remiremont. 411
Minod, l'un des vicaires de Eemiremont, jeune homme d'environ
30 ans, tres sympathique, qui semble avoir ete le principal
collaborateur de Mr
Vuillemin, dans toute cette affaire des
" grelons-medailles." La suite de la conversation eut lieu en
sa presence.
Je demandai si on pouvait me communiquer le " rapport
"
de toute cette affaire. M'etant servi d'un terme impropre, je
ne fus pas compris. On me repondit :
" Mais certainement, je
vais vous en dormer un exemplaire ; ce rapport est public,
il est entre les mains de tous les eveques de Prance, il est a
Romcr On attend, parait-il, et avec beaucoup de confiance que
la cour de Eome declare authentique le " miracle " des " grelons-
medailles " pour instituer en commemoration du fait un pelerinage
annuel a Eemiremont : ce pelerinage a deja eu lieu par anticipa-
tion cette annee-ci 1908. Je ne sais quelle sera la decision de
la cour de Eome, mais si elle fait ce qu'on lui demande, il faudra
avouer qu'elle n'est pas difficile en matiere de miracle.
Par " Eapport " on entendait done le resume^ qui a paru entre
autres dans La Croix. Je dis que e'etait le dossier tout entier
que je desirais voir et au besoin copier. " Monsieur, me repondit-
on, nous ne pourrions sans indelicatesse vous communiquer ce
dossier a moins que notre eveque, Mgr
Foucault, ne nous }
7
autorise.
Or il est a Londres en ce moment, au congres eucharistique."
On me permit n^anmoins officieusement de jeter un coup d'ceil
sur ce dossier et on me promit de le faire copier apres autorisa-
tion pour la Societe des Eecherches psychiques, si celle-ci
persistait a le desirer. L'attitude de ces messieurs, il faut
l'avouer, fut tres franche. Je demandai les noms des principaux
temoins et la permission d'aller les voir. On me donna une
dizaine de noms d'hommes, en excluant les femmes et les enfants
dont on a recueilli les temoignages en nombre trop grand peut-
etre. II semble q%Con ait recherche' beaucoup plus la qiiantiU que la
cpialiU. " Ce sont la," me dit-on, " les chefs de groupe." Cette
expression est de Mr
l'abbe Vuillemin : je la rapporte sans
l'interpreter ni lui donner un sens qu'elle n'a peut-etre pas.
Je priai Mr
l'abbe' Vuillemin de me donner sa carte pour me
faciliter l'entree : il y consentit tres obligeamment. Ce fut
heureux, car sans cette carte on m'aurait econduit encore plus
souvent qu'on ne le fit : d'autres sont venus enqueter avant
moi, la presse a polemique, on s'est injurie, rnoque, taut et si
412 M. Sage. [part
bien que les temoins pour la plupart sont las et ne veulent
plus voir personne. Ainsi, bien que je fusse accompagn^ cle
Mr
l'abbe Minod, Mr
C——,
pharmacien, tres devot cependant,
m'c^conduisit brutalement, refusa toute attestation et defendit
ineme qu'on le nommat. Son voisin Mr
G promit une
attestation ecrite pour le lendemain, mais le lendemain il la
refusa, lui aussi. J'ai obtenu cependant l'attestation de Madame
Lucie Maxel, qui personnellement n'a rien vu, mais a qui ces
messieurs raconterent l'evenement le lendemain matin (docu-
ment N° 5).
Le schema de toutes les depositions, orales on ecrites, que
j'ai obtenues, sauf une, est celui-ci
:
" Un tcl (souvent une femmc ou un enfant) m'a clit que N.-D.
clu Tre'sor 6tait sur les grelons. Alors fen ai ramassS plusieurs,
j'ai regards et, en effet, Vimage 6tait sur quclqiies-uns." Comme
cela sent Fillusion collective !
Neanmoins cette illusion devait avoir un noyau cle verite,
Peut-etre le trouve-t-on dans la deposition de Mr
Blaudelz, le seul
temoin cpie j'ai pu rencontrer qui m'ait assure avoir constate"
spontanement le fait (voir document N° 6 et Fig. 2). II m'a
dit de vive voix :
" J'etais a la gare quand les gros grelons sont
tombes. J'en ai ramasse un et me suis eerie : Tiens ! on dirait
d'une bonne femme ! (sic) Je n'ai pas reconnu N.-D. du
Tresor. Ce n'est qu'en arrivant a la maison qu'on m'a dit
que c'^tait elle. Personne n'avait appele mon attention sur le
fait." Ces gros grelons, formes par des congelations successives,
spheriques et superposees, pouvaient rappeler cle loin la figure
informe de N.-D. clu Tresor ;
et, vu l'etat d'ame des ficleles, ils
n'ont pas manque de dire que e'etait elle surement. II
suffisait qu'un seul en eut r^pandu le bruit. Les temoins que
j'ai interroges sont parmi les meilleurs, ou les meilleurs,
d'apres l'aveu de la cure. Eh bien ! Ces teinoins, a mes yeux
et sans aucun parti pris, sont de tres mediocre valeur. Petits
commerc;.ants, ouvriei's ou paysans, ils sont tous sans la plus
legere teinte d'(3ducation scientifique, et pas un n'est capable
meme de concevoir qu'il faut se defier cle nos sensations,
lesquelles sont souvent trompeuses. "J'ai vu, vous disent-ils,
douteriez-vous de ce que j'ai vu ?
" Si vous repondiez " oui,"
ils vous considc^reraient non seulement comme tres impoli,
mais surtout comme affiige d'une systematique mauvaise foi.

Or, alors qu'en pareille matiere, l'affirmation d'hommes
rompus a, l'observation exacte ne vaudrait pas grand'chose en
l'absence de toute trace materielle, que pent valoir raffirmation
d'un concierge, d'un paysan, d'une femme ou d'un enfant ?
Surtout quand ils sont sous l'evidente influence d'une passion
profonde ? Aucun n'eut meme VicUe de pliotographier un grSlon.
Passons-les en revue
:
(1) Mr
l'abbe Minod m'a communique sous sa signature la
deposition d'un des temoins qui ne veut pas etre nomine
(document N° 7).
(2) Mme
Jeangeorge m'a donne son attestation en l'absence
de son mari. Brave femme, mais ignorante ; devote ; sait a
peine £crire (document N° 8). J'ai du ecrire pour elle, elle a
signe.
(3) Mr
Claude, concierge de la filature Schwartz, ancien
gendarme, agressif, bavard, devot exalte ; il affinne que N.-D.
du Tresor a cause des degats considerables a ses ennemis, mais
quelle a epargne ses amis (document N° 9).
(4) M1Ie
Claude, fille du precedent; a refuse d'ecrire, se
declarant inhabile, mais a signe (document N° 10).
(5) Felicien Aubel, agent d'assurances ; il est tres etranger
aux etudes psychologiques (document N° 11).
(6) Auguste Lamay, tailleur ; tres pauvre et, dit-on, assiste
par la cure ; il semble abuser de la boisson et l'impression
n'est pas bonne (document N° 12).
(7) Andre, de S* Etienne, village au sud-est de Remiremont,
a 3 kilometres environ. Instituteur en retraite, tres devot, lui
et toute sa famille. Son salon est plein d'objets de piete, une
de ses lilies est religieuse (document N° 13).
(8) Mr
le cure de S* Etienne; charmant vieillard d'environ 70'
ans, mais ayant plus de foi que de connaissances psychologiques
(documents N° 14 et N° 15).
(9) Mr
Claude, de S* Etienne. Ne pas le confondre avec
l'autre Mr
Claude, qui est de Remiremont. 11 n'aurait pas
reconnu la figure de N.-D. du Tresor, si on ne le lui avait pas
dit (document N° 16).
Telles sont les opinions dans le camp clerical. Ces temoins
sont assurement tous de bonne foi, mais, rep^tons-le, de qualite
mediocre. Dans le camp oppose on n'a pas d'opinion, on n'a
rien vu.
414 M. Sage. [part
Cependant la maniere de voir de ce camp a et6 tres bien
exposee par Mr
Unger, secretaire de la mairie de Remiremont,
dans une lettre qu'il ^crivit en reponse a un litterateur
hollandais (dont j'ai eu l'^tourderie de ne pas prendre le
nom) lequel, composant un ouvrage sur la Valeur du
Temoignage humain, a sollicite des eclaircissements aupres de
la mairie. Le maire signa cette reponse. J'esperais qu'il en
ferait autant pour la copie textuelle que j'en ai prise, mais
il s'y est refuse sans que j'aie pu m'en expliquer le motif.
Je garantis quant a moi ne pas y avoir change un mot
(document N° 17).
Le frere du secretaire de la mairie, M1"
Georges Unger,
qui etait present au moment de la grele, a bien voulu me
donner son attestation ecrite (document N° 18). Get homme
est eclaire, calme, sans passion, et son temoignage a une tres
grande valeur.
La presse naturellement s'est beaucoup occupee de cette
affaire. L'Ind4pendance de VEst, un journal anti-clerical, accusa
Mr
l'archipretre Vuillemin d'avoir machine tout cela pour
gagner de l'argent. C'etait assurement une calomnie ; en tout
cas rien ne prouve cette machination. Quant a moi je ne
crois pas Mr
Vuillemin capable d'un aussi bas calcul. Sa
foi est puerile, mais elle est sincere. L'lnddpendance de VEst,
d'abord acquittee k Bar-le-Duc, a ete le'gerement condamnee
en appel (voir les coupures de journaux annexees au present
rapport, avec les autres documents).
Enfin il semblerait qu'une grele analogue k celle de
Eemiremont est tombee le 2 juillet 1908 a Bagnols, dans le
Var. Le nombre des temoins, toutefois, n'est que de trois.
Une enquete a ete
-
faite, sur l'ordre de l'eveque, le 13 juillet
1908. A Eemiremont on y voit la confirmation de l'authen-
ticite" des " grelons-niedailles " de 1907. Moi j'y verrais
plutot tout le contraire (document 1ST
0
19, Bulletin paroissial
de Remiremont, septembre 1908).
Conclusion.
(1°) En somme il n'y a meme pas un commencement de
preuve, capable de satisfaire un esprit critique, que l'image
de N.-D. du Tresor se trouvat, en effet, sur des grelons tombes
a Eemiremont, fin mai 1907.

collective, engendree par la passion religieuse, l'auto-suggestion
et la suggestion exterieure.

Extraits de Notre-Dame du Trdsor de Remiremont. Notice Historique,
par Jules Viel, Avocat.
Ce ceremonial a ete decrit par M. Thierry, chanoine ecolatre de
Saint-Die, et imprime a Remiremont en 1750:
"La veille des fetes de la Vierge, on expose sur l'autel de Tierce
" son Image oil il y a des cheveux. Elle y demeure depuis les
"premieres vepres, jusqu'apres les deuxiemes vepres. Au second
"coup, des premieres vepres, les dames Secrette et tresoriere vont
" au Tresor, accompagnees du chanoine semainier, revetu du surplis
" et de l'etole, et du sacristain de semaine portant un flambeau
" allume, precedes du bedeau. La dame Secrette met les ornements
"a cette Image. Le chanoine semainier la prend, il la porte au
"travers du chanceau, precede du sacristain, et suivi de la dame
" Secrette qui porte le carreau sur lequel on doit poser lTmage ; il
"la donne a baiser au peuple en passant, et il la met sur 1'autel
"de Tierce. Apres les Vepres on reporte l'lmage avec les memes
" ceremonies. . .
."
Aux processions de la Fete-Dieu et de l'Assomption, la Vierge du
Tresor apparait entouree de jeunes filles ;
mais, la manifestation la
plus imposante en son honneur, se rattache a une catastrophe
epouvantable. Le 12 mai 1682, un tremblement de terre, dont la
commotion se fit sentir dans toute la region, ebranla fortement la
ville de Remiremont oil un grand nombre de maisons furent de-
molies ;
l'abbaye et son eglise furent particulierement endommagees.
"Les portes, les fenetres, les colonnes furent ebranlees, les clochetons
et les statues qui decoraient le portail et les piliers furent brises,
moins le bas-relief de Clemence d'Oyselet ; on estime les degats a
80,000 livres" (Etudes hist, de Vabbi Guinot). Le sol fut crevasse en
differents endroits, et, de nos jours, on remarque encore, a la Mal-
doyenne, un accident de terrain attribue au tremblement de 1682.
Pendant plusieurs jours, les Dames, les bourgeois, tout le peuple,
camperent au milieu des prairies; on porta processionnellement Notre-
Dame du Tresor, et, d'apres la tradition populaire, le fleau cessa
416 M. Sage. [part
aussitot. Toujours est-il que le Chapitre de Remiremont fit le voeu
que, a perpetuite, une procession de Notre-Dame aurait lieu chaque
annee, le plus proche dimanche du 12 mai, afin de preserver a Vavenir
la ville d'un pareil tremblement de terre.
L'ordre de la procession du Tremblement etait minutieusement
decrit et observe.
"Le 12 mai, apres complies, on fait la procession du tremblement;
" le cure" doit s'y trouver avec la procession de la paroisse. Le
" chanoine de grand'messe et les deux dames chantres de semaine
" vont a la porte du cote de la paroisse avec la croix et l'eau benite.
" Les capucins doivent y assister aussi. On commence la procession
"par le Te Deum que la Dame chantre de semaine entonne. Apres
" le Te Deum, on chante les psaumes marques dans le processional,
"pour Taction de graces. La procession sort par la porte qui est
"du cote de la ville; on passe par la rue des Pretres, on entre
"dans Teglise de la paroisse oil Ton chante les antiennes de saint
"Romaric, Fir plus, Regina coeli, et Da pacem, pendant lesquelles le
"diacre et le sous-diacre posent lTmage de la Sainte-Vierge sur
"l'autel; le chanoine semainier dit les versets et les oraisons apres
"chaque antienne ; on passe ensuite par la place; de la, on va a la
"chapelle de la Courtine, oil Ton chante les memes antiennes qu'a
"la paroisse; on continue la procession le long de la Grande rue
" et Ton rentre dans l'eglise par la meme porte que Ton etait sorti."

apostolique.)

Mairie de Remiremont.
Procession projetde a Remiremont et interdite
par le Conseil municipal.
Motifs de lTnterdiction.
En seance du 13 mai 1907 du Conseil municipal, le Maire
de Remiremont fut interpelle par le docteur Guyon, Conseiller, sur
l'annonce d'une procession organisee par le clerge local a l'occasion
des fetes donnees en l'honneur du couronnement de N.-D. du Tr6sor
(statuette en bois tres ancienne, protectrice de la localit6).
En presence du developpement donne au programme des fetes, de
l'appel adresse aux habitants pour pavoiser et decorer leurs maisons
et les illuminer, de la presence annoncee de plusieurs prelats
entr'autres d'un eveque des plus belliqueux, ces fetes prenaient,
selon lui, le caractere d'une manifestation, sorte de j)rotestation contre
lvi.] The Alleged Miraculous Hailstones of Remiremont. 417
la loi de separation et il craigna.it d'autres manifestations contraires,
des desordres, etc.
M. le Maire repond que le clerge lni a affirme que la procession
projetee etait la procession habituelle dite du tremblement de terre
(en souvenir d'un fort tremblement de terre survenu au xvne
siecle), ce que les faits dementaient, puisque cette procession avait
toujours lieu le 12 mai tandis que, cette annee, elle etait reportee a
la fin de mai.
Apres discussion, le Conseil a l'unanimite' moins une voix, charge
le Maire de demander au clerge la suppression de la procession du
programme des fetes du couronnetnent ;
sinon, il l'interdira par
arrete.
En seance du 18 mai 1907, le Maire donna connaissance au Con-
seil d'une petition signee par 147 habitants demandant le maintien
de la procession dans l'interet du commerce local qui devait profiter
de la presence annoncee de nombreux etrangers.
Un conseiller declara que la volont6 des fideles de maintenir la
procession etait un defi jet6 au Conseil municipal.
D'autres opinent pour qu'elle ait lieu ; d'autres annoncent des
contre manifestations, etc.
Enfin, un dernier fait observer que le moment est tres mai choisi
par l'Eglise catholique, qui proteste contre la loi de separation, pour-
organiser des manifestations dans la rue.
Le vote ouvert sur le maintien de la decision du 13 mai donne
] 6 oui.
4 non.
En consequence, la procession sera interdite, ce qui fut fait par
arrete municipal du 18 mai 1907.

Re'cit historique de I'orage et de la grele du 26 mai 1907.
Huit jours a peine s'etaient ecoules depuis le Couronnement de
Notre-Dame du Tresor par Votre Grandeur au nom de Notre-Saint-
Pere le Pape Pie X.
418 M. Sage. [part
Nous etions au soir du diraanche de la Tres Sainte Trinity. La
journee avait 6te belle et chaude, mais rien ne faisait prevoir un
orage. Tout a coup nous entendons souffler en tem pete le vent du
sud-est qui chasse devant lui et qui amoncelle rapidement sur la ville
et sur la banlieue la plus proche des nuages sombres et menacjuits.
A 5 h. 1/2 l'orage eclate avec violence.
C'etait l'heure oil le dimanche precedent se chantaient, sous la
presidence de Votre Grandeur, les premieres vepres du Couronne-
ment. C'etait l'heure aussi oil aurait du avoir lieu le lendemain, si
elle n'avait pas et6 interdite, la grande procession a l'interieur de la
ville.
A la pluie qui tombe d'abord avec abondance succede une grele
ordinaire, suivie bientot d'une seconde grele plus grosse que la
premiere. Elle massacre les verandahs, brise les carreaux, mais,
chose singuliere ! elle respecte les legumes et les fleurs des jardins.
L'orage enfin se termine par une troisieme grele, dont les grelons
sont extraordinaires par leur grosseur, leur forme et leur maniere de
tomber. Beaucoup ont la grosseur d'un ceuf de poule ; ils sont
ovoides et plats sur une de leurs faces ; ils tombent lentement,
lourdement et a distance les uns des autres.
A 6 h. 1/1 l'orage 6tait termine et le ciel reprenait sa ser6nite.
Bientot on chuchote en ville une rumeur etrange
:
" Notre-Dame du TrSsor, disait-on, a eu sa procession! . . . Notre-
Dame, du Trdsor dtait sur les grelons 1 . .
." Accueillie avec scepticisme
par les uns, avec grande reserve par les autres, la grande nouvelle
laisse d'abord l'ame de la paroisse froide et indifferente ; seuls les
heureux temoins de l'evenement en restent etonnes et ravis.
Le lendemain matin, 27 mai, la rumeur de la veille prend de la
consistance. Elle se precise ; on cite des noms. C'est alors seulement
que nous apprenons, mes vicaires et moi, ce qui se dit en ville. Je
me renseigne aussitdt pres des personnes qui ont constate elles-
memes la presence de l'image de Notre-Dame du Tresor sur les
grelons qu'elles ont vus et examines.
Les renseignements que j'ai recueillis ce jour-la et les jours suivants
etaient si pr6cis, si concordants qu'il etait de mon devoir de les
communiquer a Votre Grandeur. Vous avez juge, Monseigneur,
qu'une enquete serieuse s'imposait et vous l'avez prescrite par votre
lettre en date du 17 juin.
Je l'ai annoncee a mes paroissiens en prevenant ceux d'entre eux
qui auraient des renseignements a me donner de vouloir bien venir
au presbytere. Pendant plusieurs semaines j'ai done vu et interroge
lvl] The Alleged Miraculous Hailstones of Remiremont. 419
a part bon nombre de temoins, en leur faisant remarquer la gravit6
et l'importance de leurs depositions.
Menee, je crois, avec toute la rigueur que demandait l'importance
de son objet, l'enquete a ete close le 10 juillet dans une seance
presidee par Votre Grandeur accompagnee de M. le Cbanoine Cbichy,
vicaire general, de M. le Cure de Saint-Etienne et du clerge de la
ville.

Recapitulation
Ici, cesse le recit historique de l'orage du 26 mai, des grelons
qui l'ont accompagne et de l'enquete qui l'a suivi. II nous laisse
en face du temoignage de plus de Cent personnes qui, sous la foi du
serment, affirment avoir vu l'image de Notre-Dame du Tresor dans
les grelons qu'ils ont eus entre les mains et sous les yeux.
Que faut-il penser de leurs constatations 1 L'empreinte de la
Madone etait-elle dans leur imagination seulement, ou en realite
sur les grelons nommes grelons-medailles, parce qu'ils portaient,
comme les medailles du Couronnement, l'image de Notre-Dame du
Tresor 1
Cette question a une importance capitale : la est le nceud de
l'enquete. Elle devait done porter surtout son controle sur la
valeur des constatations, de maniere a ecarter Yillusion et la
suggestion et a mettre ainsi dans un relief saisissant l'autbenticite
de nos grelons.
En voici les resultats
:
1°/ Les constatations ont ete simultanees, concordantes et precises.
420 M. Sage. [part
Elles out eu lieu en mime temps, le meme jour et a la meme
heure, vers 6 heures du soir, sans que Ton puisse dire quelle a ete
la premiere.
Elles sont concordantes : toutes affirment la presence de l'image de
Notre-Dame du Tresor sur les grelons. Les divergences qu'elles
presentent ne portent que sur des d6tails et sont imputables a l'etat
des grelons au moment oil se sont faites les constatations.
Elles sont enfin d'une precision remarquable. Ce n'est pas une
forme vague que les temoins ont vue, mais une effigie absolument
nette, minutieusement detaillee et rigoureusement conforme a la
medaille frappee en souvenir du Couronnement.
2°/ Les constatations ont eu lieu a plus de vingt endroits diffe-
rents, eloignes les uns des autres de plusieurs centaines de metres,
et meme de plus d'un kilometre, comme Saint-Etienne, Moulins,
commune de Saint-Nabord.
3°/ Elles se produisent a peu pres toutes de la meme maniere.
La curiosite les provoque et, a chaque endroit, le premier t6moin du
fait extraordinaire en est tellement stup6fait d'abord, puis ravi, qu'il
s'empresse d'eu faire part a son entourage, soit pour lui faire partager
sa joie, soit pour s'assurer qu'il ne s'est pas trompe, de sorte que
dans chaque centre de constatations il y a de deux a neuf temoins
qui se controlent eux memes.
Plusieurs ajoutent a ce controle la confrontation des medailles
qu'ils portent sur eux avec celle des grelons : leur similitude est
parfaite. En meme temps, ils ecartent les grelons sur lesquels ils ne
voient rien : tons, en effet, n'avaient pas l'image de la Madone.
4°/ Les constatations ont enfin pour resultat de produire imme-
diatement, dans l'ame des temoins, une conviction intime, profonde
et indestructible.
Vous avez entendu, Monseigneur, quelques depositions et Votre
Grandeur sait avec quelle chaleur de conviction elles ont ete faites :
" Je donnerais tous mes membres " disait l'un, et " jusqu'a la
derniere goutte de mon sang" disait un autre, " plutot cpie de dire
que Notre-Dame du Tresor n'etait pas sur les grelons et que je ne
l'ai pas vue."
J'ajoute deux faits, car l'exemple sera toujours la voie la plus
rapide et la plus sure pour saisir la verit6.
A Saint-Etienne, Mm0
Andre, mere de famille, etait chez elle
pendant l'orage de la Trinite. Son mari, instituteur en retraite, etait
absent : il assistait a une seance de patronage. Poussee par une
curiosite bien legitime, elle ramasse quelques grelons qui la frappent
lvi.] The Alleged Miraculous Hailstones of Remiremont. 421
le plus par leur grosseur et par leur forme. La voila saisie et pro-
fondement emue : C'est l'image de Notre-Dame du Tr6sor qu'elle
voit d'une facon tres distincte.
En bonne epouse, elle pense immediatement a son mari qui doit
revenir a la maison dans quelques instants, et au lieu de jouir en
ego'iste du spectacle touchant et extraordinaire qu'elle a sous les
yeux, elle cherche le moyen de retarder la fonte de ses precieux
gr 61 ons.
Elle y reussit. De retour au foyer, son mari les voit et les
examine. II est stupefait. Sa femme ne s'etait pas trompee, il le
constate avec joie.
En paroissien bien avise :
" Marie, dit-il alors a l'une de ses filles,
il faut porter ces grelons a M. le Cure."
Celle-ci obeit. L'accueil fut plus que froid. Le pasteur ne voulut
d'abord nj rien entendre, ni rien voir. Sur les instances reiterees,
tres pressantes de sa paroissienne qui lui pr6sente les grelons, il se
resigne enfin a abaisser les yeux. Ties etonne de ce qu'il voit, il a
recours a ses lunettes pour mieux s'assurer de la realite de l'image
de Notre-Dame du Tresor. L'heureux cure est anjourd'hui l'un des
apotres les plus ardents des grelons-medailles.
A Remiremont, Alcide Jeangeorge, age de 44 ans, et Marie-Clarisse
Parmentier, son epouse, agee de 39 ans, avaient loue un lot de
terrain dans les jardins ouvriers. Voyant tomber la grele avec fracas,
ils sont desoles en songeant a leurs legumes. L'orage passe, ils s'en
vont tristement voir s'il en reste quelque chose. Quel n'est pas
leur etonnement de voir d'une part que leur jardin n'a pas de mal
et d'autre part que les allees sont couvertes de grelons ! Ils en
ramassent quelques-uns : ils y voient l'image de Notre-Dame du
Tresor bien marquee avec l'Enfant-Jesus, la couronne et la robe.
En s'en retournant chez eux, ils trouvent sur le bord du canal
de l'Est des grelons bien conserves, ils en ramassent aussi plusieurs
oil l'image de la Vierge est parfaitement visible.
Mme
Jeangeorge a l'idee d'en emporter dans son tablier pour les
montrer a des parents qui se trouvent sur leur chemin, au Rang-
Sen6clial. On compare aux medailles que Ton a sur soi les grelons
qu'on a sous les yeux : la ressemblance est parfaite.
Voila deux faits : je pourrais en ajouter d'autres, car ce qui s'est
passe dans ces deux centres de constatations s'est reproduit avec
quelques legeres modifications dans tous les autres.
D'autre part, vous avez lu, Monseigneur, les remarques qui en
precedent le recit. A cette double lumiere, le simple bon sens

n'est-il pas oblige de reconnaitre que dans les constatations faites
par les temoins il n'y a aucune place ni a, ['illusion ni a la suggestion;
qu'ils ont vu en realite ce qu'ils affirment; que le nom de
GrSlons-Medailles est pleinement justifi6.

Je me trouvais chez Monsieur C le lendemain que la grele
etait tombee, et voici ce que m'a raconte ce monsieur :
" Ma laitiere,
MUe
J , vient me demander si j'ai remarque ce qui etait sur les
greions, qu'elle avait vu Notre-Dame du Tresor." II me dit la-
dessus qu'il l'avait traitee de folle. En voyant cela, Mllu
J lui
dit: "Eh bien ! allez voir dans votre jardin." Madame C—— y
court aussitot et en rapporte dans son tablier. On les regarde tout
de suite et ils y voient la meme image que M11
" J . Monsieur
C en prend un aussitot et le porte a Monsieur G en lui
demandant ce qu'il remarque sur le grelon, qui etait de la grosseur
d'un ceuf. Aussitot Monsieur G lui repond, sans connaitre les
impressions de Monsieur C : "On dirait la tete de l'Enfant
Jesus."
Moi, je n'ai lien vu ; mais Monsieur C m'a dit qu'il prenait
cela pour un fait extraordinaire.

J'en ai ramasse un des plus gros parmi eux, et je me suis apercu
qu'il y avait une forme cle figure, qui se trouvait dans l'interieur du
grelon, qui ressemblait a une figure de femme ;
puis cela m'a fait
un effet sur ce moment.
Voici la forme du grelon (Fig. 2).
Alors, le lendemain matin, j'entends dire qu'on avait dit avoir vu

I, the undersigned, certify that I have reproduced here, solely
for purposes of study, but completely, a statement which has been
made to me orally and also in writing, as here transcribed by me,
by a person whose name I am not permitted to give. This person
is intelligent and cultivated, cool and very deliberate in judgment,
and in a position that demands caution and prudence.
[The following description with rough sketch (here reproduced, see
Fig. 3) of a section of a hailstone was given by this witness :]
"(1) Outer layer, resembling crushed snow, with a rough surface.
(2) White line, very clear and thin.
(3) Inner layer, transparent like ice thoroughly frozen.
(4) Central part of a dull white, showing up clearly against the
transparent layer surrounding it, being whiter than the outer layer ;
of a very smooth surface, the lower part convex and rough or
bubbly like the outside of the hailstone."
To this description are added these words :
" The outline of the
central part was not sharp ; it was only clear white against a trans-
parent background, like a piece of paper adhering to a glass."
I certify that the above statement is an exact copy of the written
original, which lies before me. Qur ]V1inod 1

nous avons constate que les plantations etaient indemnes et les
grelons etaient a au moins cinquante centimetres les uns des autres.
Comme l'un de nos enfants nous avait dit qu'on avait vu l'image de
N.-D. du Tresor sur les grelons, sur le chemin du retour nous avons
ramasse des grelons et nous avons constate qu'en effet ils portaient
l'image de N.-D. du Tresor. Nous etions en compagnie de Mme
Richard
qui habite actuellement a Moyenmoutier ; elle a vu l'image comme
nous. Nous sommes passes chez la mere de cette dame, nous lui
avons montre un grelon de la grosseur d'un ceuf de poule, elle a
vu aussi l'image, qu'elle a embrassee par la fenetre ouverte, car nous
ne sommes pas entres chez elle. N.-D. nous apparaissait blanche
comme le grelon ; elle etait a l'interieur, dans le milieu. Je n'avais
pas de medaille sur moi a ce moment-la. J'en ai achete plusieurs
depuis. J'ai toujours eu une devotion speciale pour N.-D. du
Tresor et je considere comme une gntce d'avoir pu assister a ce miracle.

Le dimanche jour de la Trinite 27 mai 1907, a 5
lies
\ du soir,
un orage s'est abattu, sur la ville de Remiremont, venant du
Sud-Est ; la pluie a commence a tomber quelques minutes melangee
de petits grelons, de la grosseur cle petits pois, puis a cesse, quelques
minutes ; cette fois la grele seule s'est mise a tomber, dont les
grelons etaient de la grosseur de noisettes et de noix, puis tout a
coup, les grelons sont tombes, de differentes dimensions, et sous
toutes sortes de formes ; c'est ces derniers grelons, qui ont casse des
milliers de vitres a la filature oil je suis portier. Apres l'orage, deux
de mes patrons etant arrives, l'un d'eux m'a envoye faire des courses
en ville. C'est a ma sortie que ma femme Marie-Anne Melchior,
mes filles Claude Cecile et Claude Angele, etant a la porterie,
m'ont appele au moment que je sortais, et ma fille Angele, tenait
dans les mains un grelon de la forme d'un ceuf, dont l'image
de Notre-Dame du Tresor etait tres bien imprimee sur le grelon,
et tenant l'enfant Jesus sur le bras gauche, telle que la Vierge
etait repr6sentee a l'Eglise. Ma femme et mes deux filles, apres
mon depart, en ont ramasses dans notre jardin plusieurs autres
grelons, dont l'image de la Vierge et de l'enfant etait representee
sur les dits grelons.

Deposition de M"e
Claude (Ce'cile).
Je causais a une dame devant chez nous apres l'orage. Elle me
demandait si je n'avais pas vu les grelons portant l'image de N.-D.
du Tresor. Je repondis non. Au meme instant une petite fille
arrive pres du lavoir, m'apporte un grelon et me le montre : ce
grelon avait a pen pres la grosseur d'un oeuf de pigeon. J'ai
regarde et j'ai vu en effet l'image et j'ai aussitot apporte le grelon
a la maison pour le montrer a mes parents. Maman a dit : Voyons
si nous n'en trouvons pas d'autres. Nous avons fait le tour du
jardin et maman en a retrouve un, enfonce dans un trou. L'image
etait tres nette : on la voyait aussi bien qua l'eglise (sic), le
rnanteau, ainsi que la tete de l'enfant. On la voyait aussi sur
d'autres, mais plus indistincte.
L'usine avait eu des milliers de carreaux de ca'sses. Mais aucune
plante n'avait ete abimee dans notre jardin, a nous.
J'ai signe apres lecture, en presence de mes parents.

Remiremont, le 15 septembre 1908.
Le dimanche de la Trinite de l'annee 1907, entre 6 heures h et
7 heures, du soir, rentrant de voyage et apres un orage de grele, j'ai
remarque dans mon jardin bon nombre de grelons non encore fondus
et sur lesquels j'ai reconnu l'image en relief et de forme ovale de
NotreJJame du Tresor.
Cette image etait en tous points semblable a la statue veneree en
l'Eglise de Remiremont.
Ma mere, mon frere et ma tante ont, eux aussi, remarque le meme
fait.
Notre attention a ete attiree sur le fait par ma susdite tante.

greions," s'empressa d'en ramasser un et put constater la verity de
l'exclamation.
Alors elle en ramassa de differentes formes et de differentes
grandeurs, et sur la plus grande partie l'image apparaissait tres bien,
et demeurait nette jusqu'a la fonte complete du grelon. Mlle

fit meme prier beaucoup avant de consentir a regarder le grelon
qu'on lui presentait.
Pour ma part j'affirme qu'a mon re tour d'une seance du patronage
de Remiremont, ma femme m'a presente plusieurs des greions
qu'elle avait recueillis pour me les faire admirer et j'ai constat6, non
sans etonnement, la realite du phenomene dont on m'avait parle sur
la route avant mon arrivee a la maison.
L'image etait evidemment en creux mais apparaissait en relief, et
tranchait sur la masse du grelon, comme etant plus mate, moins
transparente que la masse.

J'ai entendu dire par un grand nombre de personnes de S* Etienne
que je connais, qu'ils avaient constats le phenomene, mais soit crainte

plus particulierement comme plus instruites que les autres.

Ddposition de M. le Curt Guiniot, faite d M. Sage.
Le 26 mai 1907, j'etais dans ma chambre quand Mlle
Andre
ma voisine m'appelle pour me montrer des greions sur lesquels
lvl] The Alleged Miraculous Hailstones of Remiremont. 427
elle voyait I'image de N.-D. du Tresor. Incredule tout d'abord jo
mets mes lunettes de presbyte pour m'assurer du fait et je vois
nettement dessinee sur deux grelons qu'elle rue pr<5sentait sur sa main
I'image d'une Vierge ressemblant a N.-D. du Tresor. Pendant
1'orage, j'ai observe que les grelons tombaient comme s'ils n'avaient
pas ete sous la loi'de l'acceleration de vitesse des corps lourds. Dans
mon jardin que je croyais saccage, il n'y avait aucun degat, les grelons
semblaient avoir menage arbres et legumes. Cette observation a
ete faite par nombre de paroissiens.
L'orage ou mieux la grele avait la direction de l'est a l'ouest,
apparemment au moins, car les nuages restaient immobiles. La bande
de terrain visitee par la grele n'avait pas plus de 800 metres en
large et plus de 4 kilometres en longueur, le trajet suivi par la statue
depuis le Sl
Mont oil elle etait jusqu'a l'abbaye de Remiremont
ou elle fut transported. Deux centaines de paroissiens m'ont attests
la presence de I'image sur les gredons qu'ils out vus.
J'atteste la realite de ces faits, qu'une soixantaine de paroissiens
m'ont atteste par ecrit.

P.S. —J'ai pese 4 de ces grelons pris au hasard, ils pesaient
exactement 160 grammes. L'un d'eux avait exactement la forme
d'un boulet avec bavure comme s'il sortait d'un moule.
Les grelons etaient entoures d'une efflorescence neigeuse a leur
cbute et a mesure qu'ils fondaient I'image se dessinait mieux. D'autres
que moi out remarque qu'a la fonte I'image restait la derniere.
Certains grelons etaient encadres en carre ou en ovale, et la teinte
centrale etait souvent bleuatre et meme parf'ois bombee.

Deposition de M. le Cure Guiniot.
Extrait de la Semaine Religieuse de Saint Die.
"Jusqu'ici j'ai garde un silence absolu sur les faits qui se sont
passes le dimanche de la Trinite a Saint Etienne et a Remiremont.
"Comme je suis le seul eccl<§siastique qui ait vu des grelons
desormais historiques, je crois qu'il est de mon devoir d'en dire
un mot.
"Si je donne des details circonstancies sur l'emploi de mon
temps pendant cette soiree du jour de la Trinite, c'est pour montrer
que j'avais toutes les allures du Thomas dont j'ai suivi les traces
au Cenacle.

" J'etais seul dans mon presbytere. Mon vicaire avait ete appele
pour r6gler des affaires de famille. Souffrant d'un rhumatisme au
genou, je m'etais installe le plus commodement possible pour loger
dans ma tete le gros TraiU de GMogie de M. de Lapparent (pesant
au moins quatre kilos).
"J'avais a peine tourne quelques feuillets sur la formation de la
glace, que j'entendis la porte s'ouvrir brusquement. MUe
Marie
Andre, ne voyant personne, me criait du corridor :
'
Monsieur le
cure, Monsieur le cure !
' Comme je ne m'emballe pas facilement, je
lui repondis de ma place :
'
Est-ce que le feu est a la maison ?
'
"Rassure sur ce point, j'etais reste sur mes positions. Mais elle
cria plus fort :
'
Monsieur le cure, venez vite, ca fond. . .
.'
" Mlle
Andre fit de nouvelles instances, et je me decidai a me
lever pour aller au corridor oil elle se tenait debout.
" — 'Regardez, me dit-elle, voila l'image de Notre-Dame du Tresor
imprimee sur les grelons.'
"— 'Allons, allons, lui dis-je, ce n'est pas a moi qu'on raconte
des histoires pareilles.'
"Pour la contenter je jetai un regard distrait sur les deux grelons
etales sur sa main. Mais comme je ne voulais rien voir et que,
du reste, comme presbyte, je ne le pouvais pas, je me d6tournai
pour aller rejoindre mon gros traite de geologie. Elle insista : 'Je
vous en prie, mettez vos lunettes.' Je les adaptai et vis bien
distinctement, sur la face des grelons legerement bombes dans le
centre, tandis que les contours etaient plus frustes, wn buste de femmef
avec une robe dvasie au bas, comme une chape cTofficiant : je serais peut-
etre plus exact encore, si je disais qu'elle ressemblait a la Vierge
des Ermites. Les contours de l'image etaient un peu creux comme
si on les avait dessines avec un poincon, mais tres hardiment
traces.
"M,Ie
Andre voulait me faire remarquer certains details du costume,
mais je refusai de regarder plus longtemps. J'etais bonteux de ma
civdulite, bien convaincu que la sainte Vierge ne s'occupait guere
d'instantanes sur les grelons. Je lui dis ensuite :
'
Mais vous ne
voyez done pas que ces grelons sont tombes sur des vegetaux, et
que ceux ci s'y sont imprimes. Emportez vos grelons, 9a ne prend
pas avec moi.' Je retournai a mon gros livre, sans faire attention
a ce qui venait de se passer.
"Mais j'etais distrait par ces grelons de forme si bizarre. J'en
ramassai trois pour les peser, sans les regarder de pres. lis pesaient
180 grammes. L'un d'eux etait parfaitement rond, comme les boulets
lvl] The Alleged Miraculous Hailstones of Remiremont. 429
dont se servent les enfants, et faisant cercle autour, une bavure comme
s'il sortait d'une moule.
"Pendant mon souper (j'etais seul), je me dis : Tout de meme,
ces grelons sont singuliers de forme, et une empreinte si reguliere
sur les deux que j'ai examines ne peut guere etre l'effet du hasard.
" Mais je me raidis bien vite contre toute idee de surnaturel, j'etais
honteux d'y avoir songe seulement un instant. L'orage passe, je
me levai de table pour aller constater les degats du potager. Je
ne me pressais guere, car je supposais avec raison que tons les legumes
etaient haches.
"Point. En faisant le tour des allees, je ne remarquai qu'une
tres petite branche d'arbre cassee. Mais, par contre, le sol n'6tait
qa'un vaste ecumoire, dont les trous de trois a cinq centimetres de
profondeur ressemblaient a des pas d'un gros cbien. Ces trous
resterent visibles pendant plus de deux mois aux endroits oil la
terre n'avait pas ete remuee, notamment sous les arbres.
" Ces grelons n'avaient pas ete inoffensifs partout, car sur les
toits des usines, 1,400 grandes vitres, dont les eclats allerent se
loger sur les metiers, causerent par leur chute des degats assez serieux,.
excepte toutefois dans la bourse des vitriers.
" D'apres des renseignements que je crois exacts, la bande de
terrain visitee par les gros grelons n'avait pas plus d'un kilometre
de large, allant du Saint-Mont au fort de Remiremont, traversant
les etablissements industriels de Saint-Etienue. Quelques-uns s'egarerent
seulement jusqu'a Moulins (Saint-Nabord). Mais on n'en vit ni a
Saint-Ame ni a Dommartin, ni dans le village le plus rapproche de
l'eglise de Saint-Etienne, qui n'est cependant distant que d'un
kilometre.
" Ce qui m'a paru digne de remarque, c'est que ces grelons qui
devaient etre precipites violemment a terre, conformement aux lois
d'acceleration de la vitesse des corps, paraissaient jetes seulement de
quelques metres de hauteur et n'avoir que la vitesse initiale d'un
corps qui tombe.
" Vers sept heures et demie, le bruit se repandait dans les environs
du presbytere que beaucoup de personnes avaient remarque l'image
de Notre-Dame du Tresor sur les grelons, et que bon nombre avaient
une forme de medaillons. Les enfants en ramassaient dans leurs
tabliers et les montraient a leurs parents qui constataient la presence
de la meme image. Les uns voyaient meme des details, comme
la couronne de la Vierge, de l'Enfant-Jesus, les franges de la robe.
Etait-ce un fruit de leur imagination 1 . . .
430 M. Sage. [part
" Laissant de cote ces details, il est hors de doute que la plupart
des grelons examines portaient distinctement l'image de Notre-Dame
du Tresor.
" Le lendemain matin, les laitiers, a leur retour de Remiremont,
rapportaient que beaucoup de personnes de la ville avaient fait la
meme remarque.
" Le temoignage historique devenait par la indiscutable. Le
dimanche suivant, apies la messe et le chant de la Congregation,
je demandai a ces demoiselles s'il en etait parmi elles qui eussent
vu des grelons avec l'empreinte de la Vierge. Sur soixante-cinq,
dix m'affirmerent qu'elles l'avaient bien vue. Apres les Vepres,
je recueillis encore cinquante signatures de gens bien convaincus de
la veiite de leurs observations. Je ne donne pas d'importance a
ces signatures, que je pourrais etre soupconne d'avoir provoquees,
mais elles out ete spontanees.
" Savants, mettez-vous a la torture pour expliquer ces faits par
des causes naturelles, vous n'y arriverez pas. Ce qui reste, c'est
que si la municipality de Remiremont, pour des raisons profondes
que je n'ai pas a apprecier, a interdit la magnifique procession
qui se preparait, l'artillerie celeste a fait, le jour de l'Octave, a la
meme heme, une procession verticale qui n'a pu etre interdite. . .

Deposition de M. linger, Secretaire de la Mairie de Remiremont.
II est exact que le dimanche 26 mai 1907, un orage d'intensite
nioyenne eclata sur Remiremont vers 4 h. de l'apres-midi. A la
fin de l'orage vers 4-^, apres une accalmie de quelques minutes, la
pluie revint de nouveau et fit place a des grelons de grosseur
ordinaire. Cette chute de grele dura 8 a 10 minutes, puis les
grelons se rarefierent mais augmenterent de volume ; ce fut bientot
une chute d'enormes grelons, tombant a intervalles tres courts (1 ou
2 secondes), mais bien moins nombreux que les petits grelons du
debut qui, eux, etaient tombes serres, conime tombe d'habitude la
grele.
Ces gros grelons tombaient peu serres et presques regulierement ;
on les voyait labourer la terre des jardins, dans laquelle ils s'enfon-
^aient en partie, ou bien se briser en eclats s'ils tombaient sur le
pave. Le vent etait f'aible ou nul. Inutile d'ajouter que les serres,
les hollandaises, etc., eurent environ la moitie de leurs carreaux brises.
Des verres " cathedrale " (verres depolis epais de 1 centimetre) furent
raenie brises ou fendus malgre leur epaisseur.
La chute de ces enormes grelons dura environ 3 ou 4 minutes
et le temps redevint calme.
Tout le monde sortit alors examiner ces grelons; quelques-uns
mesuraient 5 centimetres de diametre sur 2 ou 3 centimetres
d'epaisseur. Les grelons qui s'etaient brises laissaient voir nettement,
en raison de leur grosseur exceptionnelle, le noyau central et les
couches concentriques bleuatres cpii l'entouraient. Ces lignes
suivaient la forme des grelons et, dans ceux qui etaient de forme
ovale, ces lignes concentriques prenaient une forme ovale et sinueuse.
Ce sont ces dernieres particularity qui firent illusion a un certain
nombre de personnes, en leur faisant voir, dans quelques grelons,
une sorte de contour ovale, peu regulier, pouvant a la rigueur ressembler
vaguement a une silhouette humaine.
Voici, d'un autre cote, le facteur psychologique qui d6termina la
croyance en des images surnaturelles.
432 M. Sage. [part
Huit jours avant s'etaient tenues de grandes fetes religieuses a
Remiremont : on avait fete le couronnement d'une statue de N.-D.
du Tresor, madone de la localite. Le clerge avait donne a ces
fetes le plus grand retentissement possible, si bien que la piete
des fideles etait, on peut le dire sans exageration, demesurement
exaltee. Une procession qui devait avoir lieu fut interdite par
le Conseil municipal, ce qui n'etait pas pour calmer les esprits.
Ces details etaient indispensables pour bien faire voir comment
prit naissance la croyance en un miracle.
Le lendemain seulement de la chute de la grele, le bruit se repandit
peu a peu en ville que certaines personnes avaient vu nettement
l'image de N.-D. du Tresor dans les grelons. Aucune personne
sensee n'y ajoutait foi ; la presse catholique locale n'en souffia mot.
Le clerge lui-meme n'en parla pas dans le compte-rendu des fetes
de son bulletin paroissial. II paraissait fort incredule comme les
9/10
es
de la population. Cependant sous la pression evidente des
devots, et surtout, dit-on, de certaines devotes influentes, il se
decida a en referer a l'autorite diocesaine qui ouvrit une enquete
;
celle-ci conclut a l'authenticite du fait qui a ete soumis a un
savant, M* de Lapparent, d'apres VEMle de VEst N" du 19/12/07.
Ce dernier a declare en substance qu'il croyait en son for interieur
a la materialite du fait, mais que au nom de la science il ne pouvait
rien dire sans avoir entre les mains un des fameux grelons.
Cette reponse me semble synthetiser parfaitement la morale a
tirer de l'aventure.
Aujourd'hui la croyance dans les " grelons-medailles " a atteint
tous les fideles ; il est surprenant cpa'en dehors de quelques-uns
d'entre eux, personne n'ait rien remarc]ue. 11 est encore plus
surprenant qu'on n'ait pas meme songe a photographier l'un de
ces grelons. Aujourd'hui on nous annonce que l'image etait en
relief, alors qu*au debut elle etait seulement dessinee. On a egalement
demande de publier les noms des temoins entendus a l'enquete, afin
de juger de leur valeur intellectuelle ou scientifique ; mais cette
demande n'a pas ete exaucee.

terminee, je sortis aussitdfc pour ramasser plusieurs de ces grelons,
dont la taille insolite m'avait frappe. La plupart avaient une forme
plus ou moins irreguliere ; un seul pourtant retint raou attention
par sa forme presque parfaite de cylindre droit ayant, au juge
(car je n'ai point mesure), 4 a 5 centimetres de diametre de base
sur 3 centimetres de hauteur ; sa section presentait une alteruance
de cercles concentriques alternativement clairs et opaques, de forme
reguliere ; seule la zone centrale, de 1 centimetre de diametre
environ, etait irreguliere. Mais sur aucun des grelons que j'ai
examines, et de tres pres, je n'ai remarque de dessin presentant
de ressemblance, meme ties vague, avec we figure quelconque.

Extrait du Bulletin Paroissial de Remiremont, Septembre, 1908.
Nos lecteurs nous sauront gre de placer sous leurs yeux le recit
du Grelon-Miraculeux, tombe a Bagnols, dans le Var, au cours d'un
violent orage, le 2 juillet dernier, en la fete de la Visitation de la
Sainte-Vierge. Nous empruntons ce recit au Bulletin paroissial
que M. le Cure de Bagnols vient de nous faire parvenir. L'enqnete
canonique a 6te ordonnee par Msr
l'Eveque de Frejus.
Sans rien prejuger de la sentence qui sera rendue par Sa Grandeur,
et tout en nous tenant dans la reserve commandee par l'Eglise,
nous nous rejouissons de cet evenement merveilleux qui rappelle si
bien nos Grelons-Malailles.
Nous y voyons une preuve de plus de leur authenticite ; le Grelon
du Var ne fait que confirmer l'existence des Grelons de N.-D. du
Tresor.
" Le 2 juillet, fete de la Visitation de la Sainte-Vierge, MM.
Blanc Denis, Paul Roubaud, Felix Abeille, charretiers habitant la
commune de Bagnols (Var), etaient occupes a charrier des billots
de pins, au quartier Saint-Charles, dans la propriete de la Begude,
appartenant a MM. Paulet et Demutb, du Muy, pres de la riviere
de l'Endre, a trois kilometres environ de la commune de Saint-
Paul, quand vers une heure et demie du soir, eclata un violent
orage venant du cote des communes de Fayence et Seillans, et un
grelon, de la dimension d'une grosse noix, tornba seul dans le petit
ruisseau qui bordait la route.
Peu apres, d'autres grains de grele tomberent mais de grosseur
ordinaire. M. Felix Abeille, intrigue, prit dans l'eau ce gros pro-
jectile de glace. Quelle heureuse surprise quand, sur un c6te un peu
4.34 M. Sage. [PAKT
aplati, ils apercoivent tous les trois, dans l'interieur d'un medaillon
de la grandeur d'une piece de cinq centimes, une figure de femme
d'une rare beaute. Ils l'examinerent attentivement et ecartant la
main qui tenait le grelon, de facon a etablir une plus grande
distance de leurs yeux, ils virent les traits encore plus brillants.
Nul doute, a leur avis, que ce ne soit l'image de la Sainte-Yierge.
Ils sont vivement emus, saisis, et ils n'ont plus la force de continuer
leur repas. Ils voudraient pouvoir montrer ce qu'ils admirent a des
centaines de temoins et aux incredules de notre region. Helas ! ils
sont a pres de 3 kilometres du village de Saint Paul et dans un
lieu absolument desert.
Pendant 10 a 15 minutes, ils contemplent avec joie l'image
merveilleuse oil se wyaient trte Men une couronne et un voile blanc sur
la tete; les plis de sa robe sont maintenus par une ceinture ; elle a Its
mains pendantes, ouvertes et tendues un peu en avant.
Le buste seul figurait dans le medaillon, qui itait d'un blanc plus
brillant que la coque du grelon.
Le grelon s'est peu a peu fondu dans les mains de M. Paul
Roubaud et le mMaillon portant l'image a itd le dernier a disparaitre.
Tous ces faits out ete consignes dans un proces-verbal signe des
trois temoins et communique a l'autorite diocesaine.
Les heureux temoins oculaires ont raconte souvent ces faits, aux
cafes, dans les rues, partout oil on les rencontre. On est heureux
d'entendre de leur boucbe la verite exacte, et il faut reconnaltre
qu'ils n'ont aucun inteiet a mentir. Devant leurs contradicteurs

THE HALLUCINATION THEOEY AS APPLIED TO
CERTAIN CASES OF PHYSICAL PHENOMENA.
By Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.
The idea that many so-called " Physical Phenomena of Spiri-
tualism," especially of the more marvellous kind, might be
ascribed to hallucination in some way or another engendered in
the sitters by the medium lias already found more than one
able champion. This view, for instance, was advanced in the
early seventies by Professor Balfour Stewart to explain Sir
W. Crookes's experiments with D. D. Home, and was tentatively
brought forward a few years later at Glasgow before the annual
meeting of the British Association by Professor Barrett. In
1885 Eduard von Hartmann in his work Der Spiritismus,
while admitting most of the phenomena under consideration,
drew the line at " materialisation," which he also explained
by hallucination induced by the medium. And—not to make
this list too long—in more recent years the same view has
found an eloquent advocate in Mr. Podmore. After an ex-
haustive analysis of the possibilities of conjuring in such a
case as Home's, he finds himself driven to the conclusion that
in this medium's performances we seem to have before us
sometimes actual sense-deception, " though of the type which is
commonly known as illusion rather than hallucination
;
" and
he even seems inclined to extend this explanation to other
cases recorded of mediums whose reputation leaves much to
be desired indeed, and cannot in any degree compare with
Home's.1
^Modern Spiritualism, Vol. II., pp. "245-246. Are we to draw from Arch-
deacon Colley's descriptions the conclusion that he is one of those witnesses
whose most positive and emphatic assertions are not worth the paper they are
lvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 437
If we consider on the one hand, the a priori improbability
of «the supposed phenomena and the exposures of fraud repeated
ad nauseam, and on the other the many surprises which have
been slowly revealing themselves to official science in the
domain of hypnotic suggestion, we cannot wonder that this
theory (however alien to the orthodox hypnotist's experience)
should have been propounded and have attracted attention.
Again, if " collective hallucinations " be a fact—and no one who
has studied the evidence accumulated in this direction by the
Society for Psychical Eesearch can, I think, reasonably doubt
it—the theory in question will naturally derive from this
fact not inconsiderable support.
In the following pages I propose briefly to review the
evidence for " hallucination " in the domain of " Physical
Phenomena," and to try to ascertain how far it can account
for the most incomprehensible of them.
In undertaking this task I of course keep in view the
possibility of explaining many of the " manifestations " by fraud.
But since I am here concerned primarily with the " sense-
deception " hypothesis and its applicability or otherwise to the
cases under consideration, I do not at the moment discuss
in each case the possibilities of cheating. To some readers it
may appear that some—but I do not think many—of the cases
I am going to quote are of too prosaic an origin to deserve
the honour of a scientific discussion. Be this as it may, I
have thought it desirable to make the above reservation.
I also wish it to be understood that in my review of the
evidence I shall exclude the whole domain of Eastern and
Far Eastern Magic. I am of course well aware that, though
the opinion of so eminent an expert in these matters as the
late Dr. Hodgson only a few years ago (in 1893) was that
" we have before us no real evidence to the manifestation by
Indian jugglers or fakirs of any marvels beyond the power of
trickery to produce,"
1
some striking cases have come to light
in recent years which seem truly to point prima facie to
written upon ? or—on the contrary—that a notorious and repeatedly exposed
trickster can produce at times genuine and astounding phenomena? See also
for the Archdeacon's experiences Annates des Sciences Psychiques, 1906, No. 1,
pp. 26-34.

438 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part
something like collective hypnofcisation as the most plausible
explanation.
1
But startling as they are, these cases are certainly
far too few for us to use them as material in our speculations.
Many more should first be collected and analysed. Meanwhile
it should be borne in mind that certain modes of deception
may after all have been developed in the East and remained
unknown to the Western races, so that an explanation which
would lit a fakir's performance might be quite inappropriate
in a European seance-room. It should be also borne in
mind that on the only occasion when the well-known story
of the photographing of Indian conjurors (without their tricks
being reproduced on the photographic plate) assumed a concrete
form capable of being investigated, it proved to be a hoax.2
Before we start on our review of the evidence for and
against the objective reality of the so-called " Physical
Phenomena " in Europe and America, we have a serious objec-
tion to answer at the outset. It will be this : that irrefutable
proof of that objective reality has already been furnished long
ago. Thousands of slates have been written upon " directly
"
at slate- writing seances and the writing has invariably remained,
even when—a circumstance at first sight particularly suggesting
hallucination—the writing was done in full view.3

1 do not wish, however, to minimise the following fact. Some two years
ago I happened to meet an officer of the Russian navy, Captain B.-K., who
related to me that when in India some time previously he saw a fakir come
on board his ship and give a performance which included several tricks, and,
I think, the rope-climbing trick among others. A doctor who was present
attempted to take a photograph of the tricks and failed to get anything
on the plate. I naturally tried to obtain a written statement from Captain
B.-K., but failed in this in spite of repeated and urgent requests. As a
reason for not complying with them he gave this —that he did not know the
doctor's address, and that his testimony alone would be worthless ! For the
incident referred to in the text see Journal S.P.R., Vol. V., pp. 84-6.

"
Direct Writing by Supernormal Means, pp. 19, 20. I know of one or two
instances at first hand when a pencil (as in Mr. Bennett's case) was seen
to write in a tolerably good light.
It is of course impossible to appreciate the evidential value even of such
cases without a thorough knowledge of all the attending circumstances, the
personality of the witnesses, etc. That the visibility of the writing is no proof
in itself of the authenticity of the phenomenon the case of Mrs. Francis, a well-
known American slate-writing medium, clearly shows. It has been repeatedly

" materialised spirits " have been weighed and photographed or
have left behind them specimens of their hair or some part
of their attire. Not only so, but we have cases when the
photographic plate has registered images or forms which to
the sitters' eyes were invisible. Many objects—of a very
mundane and common-place nature, but of presumably unknown
origin—have appeared at seances in an enigmatic fashion and
have invariably—or at least almost invariably—remained after.
Tables apparently suspended in the air (as with Eusapia
Paladino) have been photographed ;
" spirit-hands " have left
their impression on smoked paper, or paraffin casts have been
taken of them ; knots have been tied in endless cords—and so
on almost ad infinitum.
Then we have the whole mass of the " Poltergeist " pheno-
mena (as distinct from " hauntings ") supposed to be of the
same character as the physical manifestations of the seance-
room. Surely the vast amount of crockery (chiefly, it is
true, of the cheaper kind !) broken in this connection in the
course of the nineteenth century alone is such as to compel
conviction without further discussion that such incidents (in
asserted that at her sittings, part of the slate having been withdrawn from
under the table, the pencil could be seen to write the end of a word ; and
Dr. Elliott Coues, according to his own account, saw it write a whole sentence.
And yet here is the explanation of her method. Mr. Hereward Carrington
writes to me :
"[Mrs. Francis] uses a cardboard slate, and on it places a small piece of
pencil. First, she holds the slate just under the table, for a few moments, then
above the table, and one can see the pencil jumping about on the slate, and
apparently finishing the writing. It is very convincing, and Dr. Hyslop did
not see how it was done when he had his sitting ; but subsequent observation
and experiment explained it.
"When the slate is under the table, she stretches out the first finger, places
it on the pencil, and scrawls a few words on the slate. This is all that appears.
She then lets the pencil slide down to the spot over the last few words. Then
she takes the slate out from under the table, and holds it so that part of her
hand covers the writing—the last few words. She also keeps moving the slate
about, as though to prevent the pencil from hopping off the slate on to the
floor. The pencil is dancing up and down, apparently just finishing the writing.
This is effected as follows : I have stated that the slate is of cardboard. She
has rubbed rosin over the first finger, and she draws or rubs this ringer over the
under side of the slate. The jarring causes the cardboard to vibrate, and the
small piece of slate-pencil is thereby caused to jump up and down, and gives
the exact appearance of finishing the writing. The illusion is perfect, if well
done. Dr. Hyslop and I practised it, and became quite dexterous !

their great bulk, at least) are of the most objective kind
possible.
The objection in question seems to me to have considerable
weight, and I do not see how it can be met except in the
following way : that nearly all such phenomena, whether of
the spontaneous or the experimental kind, must be presumed
to be fraudulent—even when by no means proved such, as
in Mr. Beattie's case,—almost the only exception being made
in Home's favour and, possibly, i n that of a very, very few
non-professional mediums. There is certainly some excuse for
such a rejoinder, seeing that Home's phenomena seem as described
to have been, broadly speaking, so much superior to those of
any other known medium ; but on the whole the necessity
of drawing such a distinction—which may well seem quite
artificial—and consequently of ignoring an overwhelming mass
of data, places us, I should say, in a somewhat delicate position.
Still, let us turn to an examination of Home's phenomena.
Some of them—I refer of course to Sir W. Crookes's experiments
with the board and spring-balance fitted to a registering
apparatus—having already been proved to be objective beyond
the possibility of cavil, we need not concern ourselves with
the ordinary " telekinetic " incidents of his seances, and will
proceed at once to what was one of the most striking features
of these sittings—the appearance of " spirit diands."
For this "phenomenon" we have an imposing mass of
testimony. Much of it is no doubt quite worthless; much
could probably have been explained by fraud, and in this
connection we have at least one suspicious incident on record.
1
But a good many incidents as described seem by no means
easily to lend themselves to such an explanation.
Be this as it may, we have—leaving aside for the present
the fraud hypothesis—two theories by which to account for
these hands. Either they were due to hallucination or illusion,
that is, either they did not exist at all or some other object
was mistaken for them, perhaps through suggestion by the
medium ; or they were actual " projections " from the body of
1
See Journal S.P.fi. for January and May, 1903. Some Russian sitters with
Home while convinced of his mediumship believed him to supplement his
phenomena occasionally with tricks. (I am not referring to the "spirit-
hands " specially.)
lvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 441
the medium, temporarily clothed in some mysterious substance,
which to the touch and to the sight looked (except sometimes
for the colour) like ordinary human hands of flesh and blood.
In favour of the first hypothesis we have (if we leave
out of consideration the general improbability of the fact) the
following circumstances
:
(1) That these hands were by no means always equally
visible to all present. Thus in Sir W. Crookes's words :
" A
flower or other small object is seen to move : one person present
will see a luminous cloud hovering over it, another will detect
a nebulous-lookino- hand, whilst others will see nothing but
the moving flower."
1
(2) That when tightly grasped by the hand of one of the
sitters such hands would—sometimes at least—slowly melt away.
To quote Sir W. Crookes again :
" I have retained one of these hands in my own, firmly resolved
not to let it escape. There was no struggle or effort made to get
loose, but it gradually seemed to resolve itself into vapour and
faded in that manner from my grasp."'2
Both these circumstances do no doubt tell strongly at first
sight in favour of the theory that hallucinations were in some
way or other induced by Home. With regard to the first
circumstance—since we know of course that there are various
degrees of suggestibility—it might be presumed that those
persons who saw a whole " spirit-hand " at Home's seances were
more liable to suggestion than those who saw only a " luminous
cloud," and still more than those who saw nothing. In fact
the truth of some such explanation would seem prima facie
almost obvious.
The same might be said of the second circumstance. The
" hand-melting," which has, I think, never been imitated by
conjurors, would involve another kind of hallucination—this
time tactile, of an unusual kind, but of no very great intrinsic
improbability.
It has been suggested, by the way, that such an impression
may have been due to the medium's hand being slowly and
gradually withdrawn. I can only say that such a supposi-

tion seems to me improbable. That some sitters were stupid
enough to be mistaken in this way is after all possible. But
descriptions given by such persons as Sir W. Crookes and
Robert Bell (who says he knows no analogy " in connection
with the sense of touch by which he could make the nature
of that feeling intelligible"
l
) seem clearly to show such an
explanation to be inadequate.
Now let us consider the other side of the question. The
following circumstances would seem to show that Home's
" spirit-hands," whether fraudulent or genuine, were objective
:
(1) The fact that such hands were seen by an enormous
number of persons at different times and very often by several
persons simultaneously.
Of course if we credit Home with an extraordinary power
of suggestion, this objection is of no consequence. But the
second one is much more to the point
:
(2) These " hands " are constantly described as performing-
actions with a permanent result, e.g. moving objects from one
place to another. It is hardly necessary for me to quote
instances, as such might be found in abundance in any book
or paper of reasonable length dealing with the mediumship of
Home.
And in this connection it is a striking fact that when such
undoubtedly objective movements of objects were taking place,
some of the sitters also would see only the object moving,
whilst others would see a hand carrying it. One or two
instances may be given. In Sir W. Crookes's " Notes on
seances with D. D. Home " the following incident is recorded
as having occurred at the sitting of duly 16th, 1871:
A message was given :
" It is impossible for matter to pass through matter, but we will
show you what we can do."
We waited in silence. Presently Mrs. Wm. Crookes said she
saw a luminous appearance over the bouquet [in the centre of the
table]. Mr. Wfalter] Crookes said he saw the same, and Mr. Home
said he saw a hand moving about.
A piece of ornamental grass about 15 inches long here moved out
of the bouquet and was seen to slowly disappear ... as if it
were passing through the table.
1
D. D. Home, his Life and Mission, p. 54.
lvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 443
Immediately after it had disappeared through the table Mrs. Wra. C.
saw a hand appear from beneath the table between her and Mr. Home
holding the piece of grass. It brought it up to her shoulder, tapped it
against her two or three times with a noise audible to all, and then
took the grass down on to the floor, where the hand disappeared.
Only Mrs. Wm. C. and Mr. Home saw the hand, but we all saw
the movements of the piece of grass, which were as I have described.
At another sitting
Mrs. Wm. Crookes saw a hand and fingers touching the flower in
Mr. Home's buttonhole. The flower was then taken by the hand and
given to Mrs. I., and the green leaf was in a similar manner given
to Mr. T. Mrs. Wm. C. and Mr. Home saw the hand doing this,
the others only saw the flower and leaf moving through the air.
A little later at the same seance " a hand was seen by some
and a luminous cloud by others pulling the flowers about which
were in a stand on the table. A flower was then seen to be
carried deliberately and given to Mrs. Wr. C."
1
One more detailed instance must suffice. Viscount Aclare
(now Earl of Dunraven) tells us that at a stance held in
March, 1869, at Garinish, a cottage of Lord Dunraven's on
the Kerry coast, the sitters (Lords Dunraven and Aclare and
Major Blackburn)
all heard a movement about vase N [one of the vases of flowers
placed on the small table round which the party were seated], and
Home and I [Lord Adare] both saw a hand upon it ; I said that
the vase was moving, Home insisted that it was not, and requested
me to place my hand upon it; I did so and found that it was
moving slowly round, but the sound we heard was caused by the
hand rubbing against the side of the vase ; I saw the hand all the
time. We now heard a rustling among the flowers and Home said:
" The fingers have closed over a flower and taken it away." I did
not see the flower taken, but the hand at that moment disappeared.
Home and I both observed a hand rise above the edo;e of the table
near the window and place a flower upon it ; I then lost sight of
the hand, but Home said he saw it carry the flower across the table
and place it near my father ;
my father saw the flower all the
time moving as it were of itself, for he could not distinguish the hand
that conveyed it. He took the flower and asked if it was for him.
Proceedings of the H.P.E., Vol. VI., pp. 116, 120, 121.
444 Count Perovslcy-Petvovo-Solovovo. [part
The following was spelled out: "Yes, and we will give you another
soon." My father remarking that he was very anxious to see a
hand, the following messages were given :
" Place your hand over
the flowers." He did so over vase N and we all heard —and my
father, Home and I saw—a hand moving among the flowers. "Now
on them." He did so and the hand became much more distinctly
visible to him. I said to my father :
" I suppose you were told
to place your hand there in order that they might draw some power
from you to enable them to make the hand sufficiently material
for you to see it distinctly." " Yes," was answered by three loud
raps. Sacha's (Home's wife's) miniature was now carried from
table B and placed upon our table ; none of us saw anything
supporting it, but we observed it placed quietly upon Home's hands,
and then gliding off them it moved across the table until it remained
stationary on the corner near the window. . . . Home and I now
distinctly saw a hand place little Dannie Coxe's photograph on the
edge of our table next the window and then push it a little
further on to the table. . . . Home and I perceived a whole arm.
and hand between our table and the window, it was slightly
luminous and appeared whiter than the white table-cloth. The hand
pushed the accordion, F, along the shelf, S, and then grasping it
took it off ; the accordion fell, but not heavily, to the ground. All
saw and heard the accordion moved. 1
Now, what do such incidents as these show us ? Simply
this : Had the objects not been undoubtedly moved and not
changed their place, we should certainly have been justified
in seeing in the inability of some of the sitters to see the-
supposed spirit-hand while others saw it plainly—a strong
proof of its hallucinatory origin. But the case turns out to be
quite different. We must look for the " something " which
displaced the accordion, the flower or the bell.
2
And here
the very diversity of the impression made by the moving
object on the sitters' retinae would seem to afford a slight
presumption in favour of the supernormal origin of the move-
ment. For we may, I think, not unreasonably suppose that
had the movement been produced artificially, all the sitters
would have seen more or less the same thing.

"I had been invited by the late Mis. Milner Gibson,'' says Dr. Hawksley,
" to meet a number of friends and Mr. Home at her house in Hyde Park Place.

In view of the undoubtedly objective character of many
actions performed by Home's " spirit-hands," it may be
doubted whether even the " hand-melting " above referred to
is a decisive proof of the subjective nature of these hands.
At any rate if this phenomenon experienced by so many of
Home's sitters was purely subjective, we have still to account
for the movements of objects performed by these very hands.
Thus Dr. Garth Wilkinson tells us how in the spring of
1855, at his very first seance with Home, having put his
hand under the table he felt a bell being placed in it.
Every hand but my own being on the table I distinctly felt the
fingers up to the palm of a hand holding the bell. It was a soft,
warm, fleshy substantial hand, such as I should be glad to feel at
the extremity of the friendship of my best friends. But I had no
sooner grasped it momentarily than it melted away, leaving my
hand void with the bell only in it. . . d
Dr. Wilkinson adds that he is as sure the limb he felt
was a human hand " of extraordinary life " and not Home's
foot as that the nose of the Apollo Belvidere is not a horse's
ear. I have always thought it a matter of regret that so
little attention seems to have been paid, as a general rule,
to the position of Home's feet by his sitters, not even
excluding the most famous. But here what we want to have
explained is not the movement of the bell, but the impression
of the " spirit-hand " melting in his experienced by Dr.
Wilkinson.
I will give one more instance of the curious behaviour of
It was a summer's evening about eight o'clock, and I sat near to a large
window, against which stood a table, and on the table an ordinary large bell.
... A request was made, I forget by whom, that the bell should be conveyed
away by spiritual influence. Sitting very near to the bell I distinctly saw a
well-shaped hand appear on the table, and after resting there a short time
the hand rose, grasped the bell and carried it away we knew not where.
While the hand rested on the table I rose from my seat, went to the table,
and without touching the hand, examined it by careful inspection. It looked
like a grey gauzy substance, exactly the form of a human hand, and it
terminated at the wrist."

these " spirit-hands." The narrator is Mr. F. L. Burr, Editor
of the Hartford Times, and the stance took place at Hartford,
Conn., on March 14th, 1855, the sitters being Mr. and Mrs.
Burr and Home. It should be said that a grate of glowing
•coals directly in front of the party gave what Mr. Burr describes
as " a good light."
A sheet of paper which lay on the floor
was taken from the floor, slowly lifted up and placed upon the table,
as I can affirm, without the aid of a human hand. Sitting at the end
of the table where this was done, I was enabled to see the whole of
this proceeding. The paper was placed upon the edge of the table,
and so near my hand as to touch it. I saw plainly and clearly the
hand that held the paper. It was evidently a lady's hand—very
thin, very pale, and remarkably attenuated. The conformation of
this hand was peculiar. . . . The hand also narrowed from the
lower knuckles to the wrist where it ended. All this could be
seen by such light as was in the room, while the hand was for a
tew moments holding the paper upon the edge of the table. . . .
This hand, according to Mr. Burr, took a pencil and began
to write. " This was in plain sight, being only shaded by
•
one of the circle who was sitting between the paper on the
table and the fire." " The hands of each one present were
upon the table in full view." Mr. Burr bent down close
to the hand as it wrote and ascertained that it "extended no
further than the wrist." When he brought his face still
closer to it the hand dropped the pencil and vanished. The
writing on being examined proved to be the name " in her
own proper handwriting " of a relative and intimate friend
of one of the circle, who had died a few years previously.
The hand afterwards came and shook hands with each one
present. I felt it minutely. It was tolerably well and symmetri-
cally made, though not perfect, and it was soft and slightly warm.
It ended at the wrist.
In a letter written in 1887 to Madame D. D. Home (author
of D. D. Home, his Life and Mission and The Gift of D. D. Home),
Mr. Burr subjoins the following particulars :
The hand—white as marble and not visibly attached to any arm
—
reached out to my hand and shook hands with me : a hearty
lvl] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena, 447
human shake. Then the hand sought to withdraw from mine. I
would not let it. Then it pulled to get away with a good deal of
strength. But I held it firmly, resolved to see what it was. . . .
When the hand found it could not get away it yielded itself up to
me for my examination : turned itself over and back, shut up its
fingers and opened them, let me examine the finger-nails, the joints,
the creases. It was a perfect human hand, but white as snow, and
ended at the wrist. I was not satisfied with the sense of sight to
prove this—I wanted the concurrent testimony of other senses
;
and I swung my arm up and down where the arm belonging to
this hand should have been . . . but no arm was there. Even
then I was not satisfied. Turning this strange hand palm towards
me, I pushed my right forefinger entirely through the palm till it
came out an inch or more visibly from the back of the hand. In
other words I pushed my finger clear through that mysterious
hand. When I withdrew it, the place closed up, much as a piece
of putty would close under such circumstances—leaving a visible
mark or scar where the wound was, but not a hole.
While I was still looking at it, the hand vanished quick as a
lightning-flash. It was gone. 1
The same hand—be it observed—which had just given
a palpable proof of its objectivity by writing before the eyes
of the sitters.
It goes without saying that we must not attach to this
narrative any decisive importance : Mr. Burr describes the most
startling episode more than thirty years after its occurrence,
and—and this is the main thing—we do not know in what
light we must consider his capacities as a witness, especially to
such astounding facts. Now, in the realm of Psychical Eesearch
the personality of the witnesses is of course everything ; and
it should always be remembered (this fundamental circum-
stance is too often, I think, lost sight of) that two precisely
analogous statements when made (in all honesty) by X and Y
may be absolutely worthless in one case and worthy of all
•credence in the other. If therefore I have quoted Mr. Burr's
experience, it is because, though startling, the occurrence he
describes is of comparatively uncomplicated a nature, so that

if we suppose that lie could have mistaken for the " spirit-
hand " Home's own hand or foot, we must credit him, I
think, with an extraordinary degree of stupidity. As for the
hallucination theory, it seems to me particularly improbable
in this case.
On the whole we have, it appears to me, serious grounds
for believing that Home's " spirit-hands," whatever their nature,
were in must cases at least of an undoubtedly objective
character. We see them constantly performing actions of a
permanent nature for which we cannot, I think, reasonably
account if we maintain these curious appearances to have
been subjective. In view of this fact, the " relative visibility
"
of these hands in some cases proves nothing ; nor is the
" hand-melting " itself decisive evidence.
Now, if I am told that the objective, and in some cases
the permanent, character of the actions performed by the
" hands " is after all no positive proof that the hands supposed
to produce them were equally objective, I will answer that we
must surely draw the line somewhere. I have already met
the adherents of the illusion theory more than half way by
admitting provisionally that some incidents attested by a,
crowd of witnesses at different times and very often by several
persons simultaneously (and verified in some cases by more
than one sense) may have been non-existent. But beyond this
I am not prepared to go. If a supposed spirit-hand or appari-
tion can be proved to have accomplished a more or less
complicated action—for instance, to have written a word or
to have carried an object across the room—I maintain that,
this is, broadly speaking, a proof of its reality (I say of
course "reality," not necessarily "authenticity"). If there are
people who think otherwise, I think that the onus probandi
devolves upon them.
Let us, at any rate, see how such a theory would work in
the following case. Eeaclers of the S.P.R. Proceedings will find
in them 1
a condensed account by Dr. Leaf of a sitting held
in St. Petersburg in the spring of 1893 with a Prussian medium

Vol. XIX., pp. 407-409. I had lately occasion to talk the matter over
with Dr. Lestchinsky, one of the sitters ; and he entirely confirmed to me
the startling character of the phenomena and the deep impression they made-
on him. I say this with special reference to p. 407, footnote.

named Nikolaeff, by six doctors who were members of the
Eussian Society for Experimental Psychology. After he was
entirely stripped and dressed in a garment provided by the
sitters which contained nothing white of any kind and the
two seance-rooms had been thoroughly searched, Nikolaeff was
placed in a chair in a side-room behind a portiere in front of
which the investigators seated themselves armed with opera-
glasses for better vision. There was enough light in the room
to see the medium's features and even fingers, his hands resting
on his knees. Under these conditions and the curtain having
been withdrawn, raps and noises of every description, some of
them almost deafening, began to be heard in the medium's
cabinet. Then luminous clouds began to appear beside Nikolaeff,
out of which first one hand then another gradually formed
itself and executed all kinds of movements : now Hitting
through the air, now audibly snapping their fingers, now
violently knocking on the medium himself, on his chair, on
the wall, the ceiling, the side-board and a settee which stood
in the " cabinet " ; in this case the blows were heard " three
rooms off." Sometimes these hands rose above the medium's
head, at others they would extend down as far as his feet.
Here we have to suppose a collective hallucination, both
visual and auditory, affecting six persons for a very appreciable
lapse of time. This is already somewhat hard to believe.
But when we read that later on one of these luminous hands
was seen to come close to the hanging lamp and, after rapping
upon the glass violently, suddenly pulled off the silk lamp-
shade and threw it towards the sitters in such a way that one
of them involuntarily ducked : and that still later another
" hand " pushed the settee violently towards the sitters, bringing
it almost close to the curtain, we cannot but feel that here
hallucination breaks down altogether. The throwing of the
lamp-shade and the displacing of the settee, to whatever cause
due, were at any rate of an objective character. Well, does
the illusion theory help us to understand how these things
were done ? Just the reverse. It merely complicates matters
and nothing more.
When we come to another and similar series of incidents—
the appearance of full-form phantasms, we again constantly
meet with cases when out of several sitters only one would
450 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part
see a spirit-form.
1
And in some cases the hypothesis of a.
purely subjective origin for such incidents would at first sight
seem the more natural since they obviously appear to have
developed after a suggestion made by the medium.
Let us begin with one of the least impressive episodes.
Viscount Adare tells us that on a certain occasion Home
had to drop some lotion into his eyes. I dropped it in for him and
then put the lights out. Almost immediately he said: "What a
curious effect that stuff has had, I see the most beautiful little
lights before me." I said: "That is not the effect of the drops;
you said wlfen in a trance that we should see lights." . . . He
went back to bed and then I began to see . . . the most beautiful
little phosphorescent lights moving. 2
In the following case again both the visual and the auditory
impressions are clearly traceable to suggestions made by Home,
and as Lord Adare was the only other person present during
the manifestation, the case seems comparatively easy of solution.
Briefly stated it happened thus. Lord Adare had seen in the
papers the announcement of the death of Adah Menken, an
American actress, with whom both he and Home had been
slightly acquainted. On the following morning he got a letter
from Home saying Adah Menken had been to visit him and
was anxious to come when he and Lord Adare were together. On
returning to London Home came to stay at Lord Adare's at
the latter's request. Both felt very nervous the whole evening.
After they had gone to bed and put the lights out they began
to hear music " powerful and distinct."
Home said that the music formed words : that in fact it was a voice
speaking and not instrumental music. I could hear nothing but
the chords like an organ or harmonium played at a distance. Home
became quite excited because I could not distinguish the words . . .
He asked the spirits if possible to make the words sufficiently
clear for me also to hear them. 3
1
In other cases, on the contrary, all the sitters would see lights and forms
but one. Mrs. Honywood tells us that a sitting she could at no time "dis-
tinguish any form or positive figure or see any eyes save our own," whilst
the several persons present continually saw abnormal appearances of every
description (Dialectical Society's Rejjort, pp. 366-369).
2
Experiences in Spiritualism, p. 52. 3
Ibidem, p. 34.
lvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 451
The music became louder and louder until Lord Adare dis-
tinctly heard the words :
" Hallelujah, praise the Lord, praise the
Lord Almighty.
-
' " It was no imagination or the result of
anxiety on my part to hear the same as Home did. Every
now and then I could not distinguish words, although he said
he could ; but I repeatedly heard the words above mentioned
as plainly as possible."
Home then suoqested to Lord Adare that he heard the
words " Adah Isaaks Menken " pronounced, but Lord Adare
did not. Then, the room being very nearly dark,
we both saw as it were a luminous cloud about the middle of the
room, over the table, and another luminous clouddike body floating
in the air. Occasionally I saw a luminous form standing at the
foot of Home's bed which he did not see, and he at one time saw
a similar appearance at the foot of mine which I failed to perceive ;
we distinctly heard the rustling of a silk dress moving about the
room. Home and I had called on Menken at her hotel one day
last year and she then had on a very heavy silk dress : it appeared
as though she caused the rustling of this dress to be heard by us.
At one time I heard some one moving, and on looking over towards
Home's bed I saw her quite plain (as did also Home) as a white
slightly luminous body ; I could clearly see the folds of the drapery.
In passing between him and the window Home said she obstructed
the light. She moved up from near the foot of his bed where I
first saw her, making as loud a rustling noise as a living woman
in a heavy silk dress would do, to the head of his bed, bent over,
put her hands upon his head and disappeared. 1
Such a case as this is sure to enlist the particular sympathy
of the adherents of the hallucination theory. We have, as it
were, in Lord Adare's account several separate suggestions of
Home's recorded. First he lets his friend know that the
American actress has already paid him a visit and will soon
pay another—thus preparing the ground, it may be said, for a
visual hallucination. Then he seizes upon some real or imaginary
sound to state that he hears sounds of extramundane origin \
then he urges upon his companion that a voice is speaking,
not music playing ; this time the 'supposed " suggestion " appeal's
to work with more difficulty, but at last Lord Adare gives in ;.

and though another suggestion (that of hearing the actress's
name) apparently fails, the road is clear, and Home's friend
now sees what the medium wants him to see.
1
How simple and easy an explanation ! Nor do I at all
deny that (leaving out of account the hypothesis of fraud) it
would be, broadly speaking, by far the most natural if this
case had stood alone, or if all other cases of apparitions
seen in Home's presence had presented the same character.
If so, well and good ; if not, we must look out for another
explanation ; and should the hallucination theory prove inade-
quate in other cases, we should certainly be justified in hesitating
to apply it to this one also.
I will therefore mention a case when the supposed " spirit-
form " was seen by several sitters. On the evening of February
9th, 1869, Lord Adare, Captain Gerard Smith, and Dr. Gully
of Malvern assembled together with Home in Lord Adare's
rooms in London. The company were sitting in a small room
the objects in which were made dimly visible by the faint
light that came in from the window near which Home was
"impressed "
to place himself, saying: " Sacha will try and make
herself visible to you." And then another form beside his
own—that of his late wife—grew into distinctness.
Her form (wrote Lord Adare the next day) gradually became
apparent to us : she moved close to Home and kissed him. She
stood beside him against the window intercepting the light as a
solid body, and appeared fully as material as Home himself: no
one could have told which was the mortal body and which the spirit.
It was too dark, however, to distinguish features. I could see that
she had her full face turned towards us, and that either her hair
was parted in the middle and flowed down her shoulders, or that
she had on what appeared to be a veil.
At Lord Adare's request Captain Gerard Smith wrote to
him certifying that he had also seen the " spirit-form," and
describing the apparition as follows :
Home rose and stood at the window with his right arm extended,
and the spirit seemed to sweep down, until it rested with both hands
on his outstretched arm, looking up into his face. From the position
'Instances of such "suggestions"' might be greatly multiplied. See one
further on.
lvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 453
in which I sat the profile of the face was perfectly visible to me,
and when the two faces approached each other to kiss, there was
no apparent difference in the degree of density of the two figures. 1
Apart from the question whether conscious trickery is excluded
in this episode, it will be admitted that the hallucination hypo-
thesis is considerably strained by it, for we should have to
suppose that the apparition is " suggested " by Home to three
persons simultaneously, the impressions of at least two of them,
and probably those of all three, apparently coinciding pretty
closely. Yet though strained, the theory in question may
still be said to hold the field, as neither was the apparition
photographed nor did it leave any permanent traces on the
material world ; and we still want something more to disprove
it definitely.
Let us then consider the following incident. The narrator,
it is true, was a powerful physical medium himself, but, as we
shall presently see, we have most important corroborative
evidence.
On May 7th, 1873, the Rev. W. Stainton Moses attended
a seance with Home at Miss Douglas's, 81, South Audley Street.
The sitters, besides himself and Miss Douglas, were Mrs. Home,
Serjeant Cox, and Mr. and Mrs. W. Crookes. After sitting round
the table for fifty minutes, during which time Stainton Moses
" felt power drawn " from him and was partially entranced, there
were some faint raps both on the table and on Stainton Moses's
chair. Then the accordion, on being taken by Home and held
under the table, " played a strange weird melody unlike anything
earthly I ever heard." " The table rocked about like a ship
at sea, groaned and finally separated at the joint "—but as
nothing came out of it, it was joined again. Then a chair
moved of itself, the sitters ascertaining that " direct gaze would
paralyse the movement at once," till at last Home became
entranced, rose and went into the inner dining-room, taking
the accordion with him and placing it on the dinner-waggon.
The fire-light was lowered, the reading-lamp was put out of the
room, the gas behind the window at the end of the room was
lowered, and we sat in gloom, the window at the end showing out
in bold relief. During the evening Home stood near the fire-place
1

454 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part
and kept us informed of his position. . . . We all saw a hand
descend from the top of the curtain and play the accordion. It was a
large hand and its reflection on the window blind was strong.
After this a head showed in similar way. When Mrs. Crookes was
told to go into the room and occupy the chair marked in the plan
[near the window], a form was materialised as far as the middle.
It floated near the folding doors and advanced towards Mrs. Crookes,
who screamed and it vanished.
Lady Crookes (in 1893) certifies this narrative to be an
" accurate account ... of one of the most interesting seances
"
she " ever had with Mr. Home." She says that the gas behind
the window in the back dining-room (where she had been led
by Home) " was bright enough to show everything in the room
distinctly."
Mr. Home then left me and stood between the two rooms. The
accordion was immediately taken from his hand by a cloudy appear-
ance which soon seemed to condense into a distinct human form,
clothed in a filmy drapery, standing near Mr. Home between the two
rooms. The accordion began to play . . . and the figure gradually
advanced towards me till it almost touched me, playing continuously.
It was semi-transparent, and I could see the sitters through it all
the time. Mr. Home remained near the sliding doors. As the fio'iire
approached I felt an intense cold, getting stronger as it got nearer,
and as it was giving me the accordion I could not help screaming.
The figure immediately seemed to sink into the floor to the waist,
leaving only the head and shoulders visible, still playing the accordion,
which was then about a foot off the floor. Mr. Home and my husband
came to me at once, and I have no clear recollection of what then
occurred, except that the accordion did not cease playing immediately.
. . . I have always regretted that my want of presence of mind
brought the phenomena to so abrupt a termination. 1
Here, I submit, we have good evidence that the apparition,
whether genuine or fraudulent, was at least objective, since
it was able to carry an accordion across the room and lay it
on a certain spot altogether different from the one it had occupied
a few moments before. It seems impossible to believe that
the experience of the sitters on this occasion was hallucinatory,

Proceedings S.P.It., Vol. IX., pp. 309-311; cf. Sir W. Crookes's Researches,
p. 94.
lvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 455
so I do not see much use in postulating such an explanation
in other instances which, taken by themselves, are no more
extraordinary than the accordion-playing phantom. As for the
rejoinder that the objectivity of the movements performed by
the accordion may be after all no proof of the objectivity of
the apparition, I beg to refer the reader to what I said in
answer to a possible similar objection as to the " spirit-hands."
Once we think it proved that the apparition in the case
we have just been considering was no hallucination—we need
not postulate hallucination to explain the apparition of a form
purporting to be Home's deceased wife,—whether to three
witnesses or even to one only ; nor that of " Adah Menken "
to Lord Adare, nor many similar incidents. And we need
not concern ourselves either with the general liability to purely
subjective hallucinations which seems in fact to have been the
speciality of many of Home's sitters ; or with the abnormal
appearances of every description seen constantly by Lord Adare
and Lord Lindsay ; or with the " magnificent white flower as
large as a dinner-plate and with long purple stamens " which
suddenly appeared on a chair close beside Lady D. one evening
as she sat in her drawing-room in company with Home, only
to " melt into the air " two minutes later
;
1
etc., etc. Many
such impressions were no doubt purely subjective, but this
does not help us to understand the main incidents.
So much for some of the most striking of Home's phenomena.
It is true that there still remain others to be accounted for.
Here my task will be less easy. It is difficult to prove the
objective reality of such a thing as " elongation " if the evidence
of several persons testifying to the fact is deemed insufficient
;
2
and I think the same must be said of the levitations of which,
as Sir W. Crookes wrote in the early seventies, " there are at
least a hundred recorded instances." Though much of this
evidence is undoubtedly worthless, we still have Sir W. Crookes's
testimony that he saw Home completely raised from the floor
of the room on three separate occasions, and some striking
^Dialectical Society'* Report on Spiritualism, p. 328.
2
As many as nine or ten in one instance, it would appear (D. D. Home, his
Life and Mission, p. 290). Among the persons present were Lords Lindsay
and Adare, Mr. H. T. Humphreys, a journalist, and Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Hall,
in whose house the seance took place. I repeat again that it is not the
authenticity but the objectivity of the phenomena that I am championing.
456 Count Perovshy-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part
statements from Lord Lindsay (now Earl of Crawford), Lord
A dare, and others. In 1868 in Lord Lindsay and Mr. Hawkins
Simpson's presence " in good light " Home " was levitated slowly
and swaying from side to side in air . . . on to the sofa, no
one near him or myself" (Mr. Simpson).1
In March, 1869,
at Adare Abbey Home was seen by three witnesses (the Earl
of Dunraven, Viscount Adare and Captain Wynne) to float at
a height which carried him over a broken wall two feet high
without his having touched it. " The distance that we saw
him thus carried must have been at least ten or twelve yards,"
says Lord Adare.'
2
But of course all this must go for nothing,
as well, I suppose, as Home's celebrated flight at Ashley House
on the 16th of December, 1868, though here the probability
that the performance in question was objective seems to me
not inconsiderably enhanced, and the position of those who
cling to illusion as an explanation made more difficult by the
circumstance that—his real or imaginary flight over—the medium
did undoubtedly find himself in a room which lie had left (in
a perfectly natural way) some time previously.3
I add here a case of " levitation " kindly communicated to
me by Miss Johnson, and hitherto unpublished. Of the narrator,
Miss Johnson writes :
Mr. Warndorfer (an Austrian member of the S.P.R.) contributed
the report of a Poltergeist case printed in the Journal for May, 1907.
He is an unusually intelligent and competent observer, of long experi-
ence. I met him for the first time on January 17th, 1908, and
heard then of many experiences of his. Among other things, he
told me of a case of apparent levitation, which he had witnessed.
At the time lie had been a good deal impressed by this, but on
thinking it over some months later, and trying to recall all the

Journal S.P.B., Vol. IV., p. 123.
2
The Gift of D. D. Home, p. 111. In more than one case Home is said
to have made pencil marks upon the ceiling when "levitated" {Dialectical
Society's Report, pp. 190, 194). But we are not given any details.
3
There seems to me to be a flaw in Mr. Podmore's criticism of this famous
case in this very point (Modem Spiritualism, Vol. II., pp. 255-258). He
does not apparently deny that just after his (supposed) levitation was over,
Home did return to the room in which the three sitters were. If so, by
what means? If it was simply through the door, whereas all three believed
him to have come through the window, Mr. Podmore, I think, ought to
have stated this plainly and not left us in doubt.
lvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 457
circumstances, it struck him as very odd that there was a complete
and abrupt gap in his memory at a certain point. This led him
to suspect that some dissociation of consciousness had occurred, during
which he might have been hallucinated. He was certainly in no
condition of abnormal excitement at the time.
This case occurred in Bohemia in 1906. K. is the foreman of a
factory there, which Mr. Warndorfer sometimes has occasion to
visit. K. has now left the place and been lost sight of, so that
his testimony cannot be obtained. Alice Johnson.
The following is Mr. Warndorfer's own account
:
o
At the sitting four persons took part. The foreman K., his wife, a
woman of about 50, very hysterical, the medium and myself. The
medium is the wife of the editor of a small local (Bohemian) paper
;
she is not a professional medium and came on being invited ; I paid
her travelling and other expenses. She had been recommended to
me as a trance-speaker and clairvoyant : at previous sittings she
had delivered speeches and given messages which, though quite
interesting, had no evidential value whatever. We sat in the corner
of the foreman's parlour—see sketch—which was half in the dark ;
the light came through the open door from a lamp; the light was
sufficient to see the features of all the persons clearly ; I think one
could have read ordinary print.

After a few minutes, Mrs. K. had an attack of hysterical twitch-
ings, threw her arms and legs about and finally fell off her chair
and remained, all in a heap, under the table, her head resting on
her knees ; she was left there, so as not to disturb the medium
and K. saying that he was not anxious about her. The medium
had in the meantime risen from her chair waving her arms in
a circular movement ; her body was stiff, her eyes closed and she
leaned backward. The foreman got up and stood behind her with
his arms spread out in order to protect her against knocking
against two high cupboards, forming an angle behind her. She
breathed heavily and after a few moments rattled in the throat
;
K. spoke to her soothingly and made passes round her, all the
while standing close behind her (between her and the chests). I
sat quietly watching her, when suddenly there were two very loud
knocks, seemingly on the wall below the window opposite, and
she appeared to be floating horizontally above the table, about a
foot from it, her head on or near K.'s chest, her arms still waving
about and her feet kicking frantically in the air, so that I had
to jump up in order to avoid being kicked in the face ; I remember
seeing her (after I stood up) clear above the table, for about
half a minute ; her skirt did not touch the table, she was free in
the air, except perhaps her head and the back of the neck, which
may have rested against K.'s chest. She breathed so heavily now,
that I was afraid she might suffer seriously, so I made some passes
over her body in the air and then down her body from the shoulders
to her feet, when she stood on the ground, which soothed her at
once and brought her back from the trance ; she spoke a few words
and was not aware of what had happened.
We awakened Mrs. K. who asked at once :
" Now, have you
seen them?" "Whom?" "Why, the two men, who knocked and
came in from there (pointing to the window) and carried her (the
medium) about on their shoulders." So far as I know Mrs. K.
was fast asleep under the table, with her head on her knees ; I
am not sure, however, whether or not she saw the medium above
the table; she may have done so, without my noticing it. I
spoke to K. about the phenomena, immediately afterwards and
again later on; I omitted, however, what a more efficient investi-
gator would have done at once, to ask him what he had seen and
to preserve his record, independent of mine. I remember to have
spoken with him about the medium's floating, and mentioning the
fact that it could not be considered a case of clear levitation as
lvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 459
the medium seemed to have touched his body at least with her
head and perhaps her neck ; he related the occurrence to the
medium and to his wife, and conversation concerning it was carried
on for some time, but his perceptions may have been tainted by
mine ; he was evidently very pleased at something remarkable having
occurred at his house in my presence and he would have, most pro-
bably, willingly accepted and believed any suggestions given by me.
I considered the case a very interesting and good one till it struck
me one day, in thinking the matter over, that I could not recall how
the medium got down from the floating into the standing position; I
have a hazy idea about her getting up ; I clearly remember her
leaning back further and further, her body being quite stiff, and
think I recollect a kind of stepping movement before I had her feet
close to my face ; I distinctly remember her feet kicking at my face
and the sight of her rather shabby stockings and shoes ; but from
the moment when I made passes over her horizontal body till the
time when she woke up, standing, still under my passes, I cannot
recall the movements of her body; there is an absolute blank in
my memory. Possibly I got flurried by her laborious breathing
and the fear that she might suffocate ; I do not think so, however,
as I was very quiet and not at all excited during the seance,
having assisted at a good many before and not being of a very
excitable temperament. I have come to the conclusion therefore
that I may have been under a hallucination when I believed her
to float above the table ; what could have evoked such a hallucina-
tion I could not tell, as I only expected to hear a speech or some
clairvoyant description ; what speaks in favour of the hallucination
theory would perhaps be the circumstance that the medium never
before, nor for some time afterwards, showed any physical pheno-
mena. I therefore give you the case more as one of a possible
curious hallucination than as one of levitation. If you wish, I can
try and get a report from K. .

I have no comments to offer on this case. My assertion
that I see no particular grounds for believing in the subjective
character of the supposed levitation would be of course as
gratuitous as Mr. Warndorfer's declaration that he believes
his experience to have been hallucinatory. I will content
myself with remarking that the " absolute blank " which, as
it seems to him, did occur at a certain point in his memory
does not appear to me to be a decisive prpofe

state. I am not at all sure such blanks are not to be
met with in ordinary life and under quite commonplace
circumstances.
Eeturning to Home's case, we may next consider the " fire-
test," the handling of coals, etc., and causing other people to handle
them,—a circumstance which at least one very able critic of
the Home evidence has apparently left unnoticed. I confess I
do not always see where the element of illusion can creep in
in the very numerous accounts referring to these episodes.
We constantly read of red-hot coals and hot lamp-chimneys
behaving just as they should in the natural course of things
;
of Captain Gerard Smith getting a blister on his finger after
touching a glass chimney which had just been found quite
cool to the touch by Lord Lindsay and Mrs. Honywood,1
of
a large red-hot mass of coal which, after it had been handled
with immunity by Home first and then by Lady Gomm, on
being laid upon a sheet of paper caused it to blaze directly ;
2
of a match which instantly ignited when brought into contact
with a chimney which Home had apparently left for four
or five minutes in the fire-place among the glowing coals
(after which, we are told, he " thrust the heated glass into
his mouth applying especially his tongue to it
"
3
), etc. In
these cases it cannot be supposed that suggestion and illusion
made a roomful of people mistake an inoffensive orange for
a " red-hot mass of coal " or a genuinely cool lamp-chimney
for a hot one. But if not, what happened ? The objects in
question must have been handled by some one to produce
these effects—and, if so, how could they, under the circumstances,
have been so handled with impunity ? And is it really possible
to believe that nine sitters should have been induced to see
during four or five minutes glowing coals placed on the head
of Mr. S. G. Hall, his white hair being drawn up in a pyramid
over the bright red mass, if nothing of the kind had occurred,
the more so as we read that on brushing his hair at night
Mr. Hall found a quantity of cinder dust ?

And how can
we logically admit this strange mixture of " fact and fancy

constantly occurring if we adopt the illusion hypothesis : scores
of people believing that they are handling hot coals and
chimneys when they are in fact touching something quite
different, or nothing at all ; scores of other people who believe
themselves to be witnesses to the same fact ;
persons becoming
victims to this extraordinary illusion instantaneously and in
succession ;
and, amid all this, some undoubtedly physical
effects, whether of a temporary (as with Captain Smith's finger)
or of a permanent character, produced by objects supposed
(under the hypothesis in question) to be quite different from
what they appear to be ? To adopt such a theory seems to
me to strain incredulity (should it not rather be called credulity
the other way ?) to the utmost.
Now if I am told that I have been writing this under a
misconception of the theory ; that if suggestion there was, it
must have worked in one sense only—that of ensuring immunity
for the sitters who went through the " fire-ordeal "—I will
answer that this is no explanation ; and that what we want
to know is precisely how suggestion can have protected Home's
sitters not only from the feeling of intense pain which must
have been felt under the circumstances, but also from physical
effects ?
So much for the most startling of Home's " manifestations."
I have attempted to show that as applied to them the theory
of suggested hallucination does not cover the whole ground
(in some cases is even obviously unsatisfactory), and that it
cannot, by any means, give us an adequate solution of the
whole mystery.
I have left for the end of my examination of the Home
evidence a case which seems at first sight to present a real
difficulty for my argument : I refer to a well-known instance
when a landscape was made visible to several persons in a
crystal ball at one of Home's seances. Our chief witness
is the Master of Lindsay, who says
:
Another time at Mr. Jencken's house I saw a crystal ball placed
on Mr. Home's head emit flashes of coloured light, following the
order of the spectrum. The crystal was spherical, so that it could
not have given prismatic colours. After this it changed, and we
all saw a view of the sea, as if we were looking down at it from
the top of a high cliff. It seemed to be the evening, as the sun was
4G2 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [pakt
setting like a globe of fire, lighting up a broad path over the little
waves. The moon was faintly visible in the south, and as the sun
set her power increased. We saw also a few stars and suddenly
the whole thing vanished like shutting the slide of a magic lantern;
and the crystal was dead. This whole appearance lasted about ten
minutes. . . .
There were two candles and a bright fire burning in the room. 1
Another gentleman, Mr. J. Hawkins Simpson, has given (in
a letter to Dr. Edmunds, Secretary of the Dialectical Society)
the following version of the same episode
:
A large landscape view as carried in my brain was made perfectly
visible in a spherical crystal to every one in a dark room, although
the individuals composing the party occupied places opposite to each
other, and no one except Mr, Home, who held the crystal, was within
three feet of the crystal. . . . Colours were similarly produced,
though I could not gather that any brain then present was the
exciting cause. Every colour of the rainbow was given brilliantly,
especially the violet of a very opaque character ; and that (as rapped
out) "to show the violet as seen by disembodied spirits." 2
That is, I believe, all the information we possess regarding
this interesting incident. Meagre as it is, we find in the
statements coming from our only two witnesses an important
discrepancy. According to one there were in the room two
candles and a bright fire burning. The other says the room
was dark.
3
We do not know either the names or the number
of the persons present, nor—which is particularly important
—
how far their impressions actually coincided ; nor how far
they were independent of one another ; nor whether the
medium spoke or preserved silence ; in fact, we hardly know
anything beyond the bare fact of the vision. And Mr.
Hawkins Simpson's account in particular is so loose and
scanty that we do not even feel sure that the two last
sentences I have quoted refer to the same episode as Lord
Lindsay's.
1
Diabetica!, Society's Report, pp. 206-207.

Ibidem, p. 259.

So great is the discrepancy, indeed, that I should have thought the two
witnesses were referring to two separate incidents did not one " who ought
to know'"—.Mine. Home—explicitly state the contrary (The Gift of D. D.
Home, p. 252-253).
lvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 463
Still, unsatisfactory as the evidence is, it is first-hand testi-
mony coming from trustworthy witnesses and so cannot be
dismissed without further consideration. Moreover, Lord
Lindsay and Mr. Simpson's experience is not unique. In a
very interesting case printed a few years ago in the S.P.B.
•Journal} which I will now quote, we have also au instance
of apparent collective vision in a mirror affecting not less
than four persons. The incident occurred in May, 1904, at
15 , Switzerland, Mrs. C. (a friend) being the medium.
Here is the evidence of one of the witnesses, Mrs. A., given
in a letter written shortly after the event to Mrs. H. J.
Wilson, an Associate of the S.P.B., who is intimately
acquainted with all of them, and who first reported the case
verbally to Miss Johnson
:
It was in my bedroom at B , Switzerland. Mrs. C was
the medium. She was seated facing the long mirror in my ward-
robe, and we, that is C. [Mrs. P., sister of Mrs. A.], A. [the
daughter of Mrs. A.], Mrs. H., and myself, were seated just be-
hind her, also facing the mirror. Mrs. C was not in trance.
In a very short time we saw my father's face form over Mrs. C.'s
face (in the mirror), and then S 's face, two or three times fol-
lowing. She was smiling and looking hard at us, her two sisters.
Then she faded away, and a long corridor came, with a large hall
or room at the end of it, brilliantly lighted up. Many figures were
walking about, but my figure and E.'s [Mrs. A.'s son] were the
most prominent—there was no mistaking them. I recognised my
own figure walking about, and leaning forward to talk. That was
all, as it was rather late, and time to go to bed.
S., the sister of Mrs. A. and Mrs. P., had died in March,
1904; E., the son of Mrs. A., was living at the time, and
in London.
The account of the other sister, Mrs. P., was dictated by her
to Mrs. Wilson, and sent to Miss Johnson enclosed in a letter
from Mrs. Wilson, dated October 3rd, 1904. It is as follows:
It was at B , about May 1st, 1901, at 8.30 p.m. The elec-
tric light was full on all the time, shaded only by a piece of silver
tissue paper. There were present Mrs. C (the medium), Mrs.
A ,
A., Mrs. H , and myself. Mrs. C. sat in front of a mirror,
l
Vol. XII., February, 1905, pp. 17-21.
464 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part
Mrs. A. and I sat just behind her, and the other two to right and
left of us respectively. Behind us was the bedroom wall, and a
washing stand against that, with a small mirror over it. The
medium was not entranced. I saw S 's face form on Mrs.
C 's face, followed by that of old Mrs. P . Then came a
full-length figure of my father in the mirror, in his robes, very like
the portrait. He looked benignant and rested, with lines of face
much smoothed away. This faded, and then all perceived a long
passage in the mirror, at a guess about 25 feet long, with bay
window at the end, and sunshine streaming through. There was
a window seat, and two figures standing by it, unrecognisable.
Then third figure appeared, also unrecognisable. They seemed to
look out of window and converse. Medium then became tired.
The next account, written in October, 1904, is from Miss
A., and is as follows
:
Mother, Mrs. C , Aunt C [Mrs. P.], another lady, and
myself, were all seated in front of a large pier glass, Mrs. C
(the medium) being slightly nearer the glass (say 3 inches) than the
rest of us. The gas was turned down to about half its strength.
Presently, after sitting ten minutes or so, we saw what appeared to
be a white mist rising up in front of the medium's reflection, and it
finally resolved into a good and distinct likeness of Grandad. When
we recognised it the figure smiled and nodded its head. Then a
likeness of Aunt S appeared, not so distinct, but perfectly easy
of recognition, after which a lady appeared unknown to four of us,
but recognised by the lady who was sitting with us.
For a time we saw nothing but mist again, but it gradually
cleared, and a long corridor became visible with a door at the further
end evidently opened inwards, and screened on the side nearest us
by looped curtains, through which we saw into a brilliantly lighted
room, whether bright sunlight or artificial light we could not tell.
Figures too distant to be recognised came and went in the room,
and once a girl in what appeared to be bridal dress stood just be-
hind the opening of the curtain. Then the doors appeared to be
shut for a time, but presently opened, and two figures pushed aside
the curtains and came down the corridor towards us, talking. We
recognised them as Mother and E . Then the picture faded
again and we closed the sitting. This is to the best of my recol-
lection, but as I took no notes at the time, I may easily have
forgotten details.

In answer to further questions Miss A. writes :
October Uth, 1904.
The likenesses were formed on Mrs. C 's image in the glass,
as it were, transforming her features into those of the persons re-
presented. Her own face, as distinct from the image, was unchanged,
except that the eyes were closed, while the faces in the glass all
had their eyes open. This is an interesting point, I think.
The fourth witness, Mrs. H., dictated her account to Mrs.
Wilson in the early part of November, 1904, as follows:
I first saw the head and shoulders of an old clergyman with grey
hair—no beard ; he wore the old-fashioned " Geneva bands " that the
clergy used to wear. I did not recognise him, but heard Mrs. P
and Mrs. A—— say it was their father. I did not see him on
the medium's face, but in a corner of the mirror, apart from the
medium. I also heard Mrs. P and Mrs. A say that they
saw their sister, but I did not see her. After this we saw a ball-
room in the mirror, very brightly lighted, with people walking
about in it. I did not recognise any of them. I ought to have
said that at first I saw a curtain across the room, and it was when
it was withdrawn that I saw the people walking about.
The room we were sitting in was lighted by a candle.
On this case, the Editor comments as follows
:
It is unfortunate that the witnesses did not record their impressions
at the time, or immediately afterwards, since it is clear that in some
respects their present recollections are not quite correct. Thus Mrs. P.
says: "The electric light was full on all the time, shaded only by a
piece of silver tissue paper." Miss A. says :
" The gas was turned
down to about half its strength." Mrs. H. says :
" The room we
were sitting in was lighted by a candle." One or other of these
descriptions must be inaccurate, unless all of them are incomplete.
It must however be remembered that we hardly ever find two
people giving exactly the same description even of ordinary events,
and we very seldom have the opportunity of comparing together
as many as four independent accounts of the same occurrence.
Whenever we did this, we should probably find quite as much
disagreement as in the present case.
The position of the medium in relation to the mirror and to the
sitters is described in very similar terms by Mrs. A., Mrs. P., and
4b'6 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part
Misa A., except that Mrs. A. and Mrs. P. say that they sat just
behind the medium, while Miss A. describes the medium as being
only "slightly nearer the glass (say 3 ins.) than the rest of us."
When we come to the descriptions of the figures seen in the
mirror, the discrepancies are far more marked. There is, of course,
no proof of inaccuracy in this, because it is quite possible—not to
say probable—that the hallucinations were not the same to all the
percipients. Miss A. is the only one who describes the appearance
of a white mist in the mirror preceding the appearance of the
figures. (Our readers will remember that this appearance is a familiar
experience with crystal-gazers, whether as a preliminary to subjective
or to veridical visions.) With regard to the individual figures seen :
(1) As to the father of Mrs. A. and Mrs. P., Mrs. A. and Miss A.
say that they saw his face form over Mrs. C.'s face in the mirror,
Miss A. adding that the figure smiled and nodded its head. Mrs. P.
describes a full-length figure of her father in the mirror, in his robes,
the figure having no connection with the medium's reflection in the
mirror. Mrs. H. describes the head and shoulders of an old clergyman
with grey hair and "Geneva bands," "not on the medium's face,
but in a corner of the mirror, apart from the medium." (2) The
sister of Mrs. A. and Mrs. P. was seen by both of them and by
Miss A. in a similar manner—her face forming over the medium's
face in the mirror; but not seen at all by Mrs. H. though she
heard the others saying they had seen it. (3) " Old Mrs. P." is
mentioned only by Mrs. P. (-f) An unrecognised lady is described
only by Miss A. (5) In the scene of the long corridor, with a
brilliantly lighted room at the end, and figures walking about in
it, all the figures were unrecognised, except those of Mrs. A. and
her son, which were recognised and described (though somewhat
differently) by Mrs. A. herself and her daughter.
These various discrepancies may arise either from actual dissimi-
larities in the hallucinations, or perhaps from inaccuracies in the
recollections of the witnesses, or possibly from a combination of
both causes ;
but, however this may be, there seems no doubt
that the hallucinations were to a great extent similar. The case
then affords a striking proof of the possibility—so often denied
—
of producing hallucinations in several persons at once by mere
suggestion and expectancy, without hypnosis or any such process.
No verbal suggestion even was employed by the medium ; for
Mrs. Wilson, having made special enquiries on this point, tells us
that Mrs. C. closed her eyes and did not speak during the sitting
;
lvi.J Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 467
the sitters, however, did describe what they were seeing to one
another during the time of the vision.
In considering such a case, however, the question first natur-
ally presents itself: what part did the medium really play in
the whole incident ? And was her presence an essential sine
qua non ? Neither in Home's case nor in Mrs. C.'s do we
know whether the medium willed his sitters to see particular
images—surely an important circumstance. May not his or her
part have been mostly passive ? We know of other cases of
collective crystal or mirror-vision, sometimes in the absence of
any recognised medium, and it may be asked whether there is
after all so wide a gulf between two such cases as Mrs. C.'s
and, e.g. Miss Grieve's ?
1
The latter episode seems to me to
afford some good evidence for thought-transference, since it is
alleged that both Miss Grieve and her friend preserved silence
throughout the vision ; in the former case, on the contrary, the
sitters described to each other what they were seeing, though
the medium did not speak. But whether we admit that
thought-transference, perhaps helped by verbal suggestion, did
operate in the case of our four witnesses or not, I repeat we
have no evidence that they saw what the medium wanted them to
see ; and until we have such evidence, similar cases, however
interesting, can hardly prove the possibility of inducing
collective hallucinations.
But apart from this and in any case, there must surely be a
difference between the mental attitudes of two persons, one of
whom sees an image in a mirror, while the other beholds a
scene enacted or a " form " moving in a room ; and even
supposing some mediums occasionally have power to cause their
sitters to see images at will, e.g., in the narrow circumscribed
sphere of a crystal ball (which from the very nature of the
experiment these sitters must know to be purely subjective), it
does not necessarily follow that they will have equal success
when dealing with the seance-room instead of a crystal, and
when it comes to making the persons present believe in the
objectivity of the forms and of the more or less complicated
incidents to be seen.
Such an inference does not seem to me logically inevitable.

Do I therefore positively deny that it is in hallucinatory
impressions, more or less deliberately induced by the medium,
that we must look for an explanation of some incidents con-
nected with spiritistic seances ?
I do not.
When an abnormal impression is experienced by only one
sitter at a time (whether this sitter is or is not peculiarly liable
to purely subjective hallucinations) ; when the explanation by
fraud seems to present serious difficulties, and when we have
no other positive evidence for the authenticity of the " pheno-
menon " supposed to have occurred, then I think we are logically
bound to accept, at least provisionally, the explanation that the
sitter in question (and may be even many sitters in succession)
was subject to a hallucination or to an illusion of the senses.
Let us take for instance a " manifestation " I have often
witnessed (and described
l
) at the sittings of the late Eussian
medium, Sambor. Chairs would be frequently threaded on his
arm without, according to his neighbours, his hands having been
released for a moment. And this would occur almost ad
libitum : persons who had never attended a seance in all their
life being sometimes equally privileged with the medium's
habitue's: men and women, young and old, sceptics and
believers.
A wide experience of Sambor's sittings left on my mind at
the time the impression that this chair-threading was not due
to conjuring—at least conscious conjuring—on the part of the
medium, and that we must search for some other clue. Of
course two explanations only are possible : either we had in this
case an instance of the " passage of matter through matter,"
or there must be in the experience a hallucinatory element.
The first explanation I now reject, because to believe such
a thing possible one must have incontrovertible proof, and this
proof we failed to get in the course of our experiments. Nor
do I think it has ever been got elsewhere.
There remains therefore only one other alternative : as I have
just said, a hallucinatory element must have come in somewhere.
Either the sitters, all of them, were mistaken in their impression
that a chair was hangins: on So-and-So's arm, when in fact it
1

and Proceeding* S.P.B., Vol. XXL, pp. 396-7.
lvl] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 4G9
quietly stood by (an " explanation " which I utterly and un-
hesitatingly reject) ; or the medium's neighbour was mistaken in
his conviction that he had not let go Sambor's hand for a
quarter of a second, and there must have been a moment
when he felt a hand to be in his when in fact there was none.
Since not only was it to the medium's interest to create
such an erroneous impression, but it can hardly have originated
spontaneously (in the beginning at least) in the sitter's mind, it
must have come, in some way or other, from Sambor. Since no
one, I believe, ever heard him make a corresponding verbal
suggestion, the suggestion must have been mentally made ; and
I may perhaps go one step further and add that I am
prepared to admit it may have been made unconsciously.1
Improbable as such an explanation may appear (to specialists
in hypnotism and suggestion in particular) it is of course a
thousand times more plausible than the " passage of matter
through matter " ; and so there seem to me to be good reasons
for holding to it. I will adopt a much simpler one after a
conjuror has proved to me that unnoticed liberation of a hand
under Sambor's conditions is possible, but hardly before.
2
In the present instance we are therefore quite justified,
logically, in framing such a theory. But suppose the " passage
of matter through matter " should ever be scientifically
established, our theory would then have to be in all probability
abandoned as inadequate and unnecessary. But I think such
a day will not come for a long while.
Why, it may be asked, did I not admit a similar explanation
for the melting of the " spirit-hands " at Home's seances ?
Simply because it would not have helped us to understand
many other incidents connected with these same " spirit-hands."
When these incidents have been explained away and nothing
left of them, then I am ready to accept a suggested tactile
hallucination as a very plausible explanation.
1
On this (supposed) suggestion and consequent illusion of the sense of touch
other hallucinatory impressions— this time spontaneous—may have sometimes
grafted themselves, as in Madame Youdenitch's experience (S.P.P. Proceedings,
Vol. XXI., p. 396, footnote).

Some episodes connected with " materialisation " seances,
especially in America, are also quoted sometimes as evidence of
the mediums' power to influence their sitters, in a certain sense,
and engender illusions in them. I refer chiefly to cases of the
supposed " recognition " of dead relatives and friends. Such
cases seem to be frequent.
1
To quote Professor H. H. Furness's
words :
It is, I confess, a very puzzling problem ... to account for
the faith, undoubtedly genuine, which Spiritualists have in the
personal reappearance of their departed friends. Again and
a°ain have I asked those who have returned from an inter-
view with a spirit at the cabinet to their seats beside me
whether or not they had recognised their friends beyond a per-
adventure and have always received an affirmative reply, sometimes
strongly affirmative. . . . Again and again men have led round the
circle the materialised spirits of their wives and introduced them
to each visitor in turn ; fathers have taken round their daughters,
and I have seen widows sob in the arms of their dead husbands.
Testimony such as this staggers me. Have I been smitten with
colour blindness ? Before me, as far as I can detect, stands the
very medium herself, in shape, size, form and feature true to a
line, and yet, one after another, honest men and women at my
side, within ten minutes of each other, assert that she is the absolute
counterpart of their nearest and dearest friend, nay that she IS
that friend. 2
An instance may be given more at length. Mr. William
More of Denver, Colorado, personally known to Miss Johnson,
writes to her as follows on September 19th, 1906 :
As per your request I herein give you a short account of my
experiences some years ago in a series of materialisation seances,
held in Denver during the years of 1880 and 1881.
Have been a resident of Denver continuously since 1879 ; the
following year my attention was called to the mediumship of a
certain Mrs. Miller [now Mrs. Wilcox] then a resident of Denver,
coming here from Tennessee, her native State. I also met her father,
Tittle by name, a contractor and builder ; he told me these mani-
festations in one phase or another had followed her from infancy.

This is the medium referred to by Bishop Watson of the South
Methodist Church, and who published his experiences in a series
of books entitled The Clock struck one, two, three, etc. However, the
phases which came to my attention were materialisation and de-
materialisation, these varying all the way from personation and
transfiguration to the clear independent form. The personnel of
the circle contributed largely towards success or failure in produc-
ing the highest phase, viz., "distinct independent form materialisation."
Have seen the conditions so poor that personation of the entranced
medium alone could be had ; but often that phase furnished remark-
able tests as to character and personal traits of the communicating-
spirit. The first circle I attended, I assisted Mr. Miller to put up
the cabinet, which was a simple four-sided screen, made of dark
grey blankets hung on a rough wood frame ; the blankets hanging
so as to part in front. In the cabinet was a lounge or chair
for the entranced medium to recline on. Mrs. Miller was searched
by a committee of ladies, who certified that both her outer and
underclothing was entirely black, then a minute search was made
of the cabinet and surroundings; windows and doors sealed, the
medium tied and light shaded. After singing some familiar song
or hymn, the voice of Eed Face, the Indian control, generally spoke
out loud and distinct. Then faces and hands were plainly seen,
as well as balls of light on the carpet and round the room. These
light balls often showed faces, and later on full forms would shape
themselves and disappear in front of us.
When the full power had been attained, Eed Face called the
individual sitters wanted by the spirit to the cabinet ;
they entering
and generally finding the medium entranced. When I was called,
I shook hands with the form of a lady, who seemed greatly distressed
that I did not at once recognise her; sobbing she said, "William,
don't you know your mother 1
?" Her voice then sunk so low I
could not hear, and she moved towards a stand where there was
paper and pencil, but before she wrote anything the pencil dropped
from her hand, and she and I stooped down to search for it ; but
the excitement attendant on meeting me broke her down so much
that she requested feebly to be assisted back to the cabinet. From
the time she left the cabinet till she retired back, she leaned
heavily on my shoulder, and I felt this weight up to the front of the
cabinet, when she dematerialised suddenly. Later at other seances
have seen her walk stronger, but always very lame. Neither Mrs.
Miller nor any other person in Denver were aware that my father
472 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part
had married twice, and that the lady then known as Mrs. More was
not my mother, as I nor anyone in the family had ever mentioned
it, nor that my mother had died after losing a limb on the operating
table. All this, together with expressions and peculiar mannerisms,
convinced me that this was really my mother. Another circle I
was present at ; after the routine opening work, the form of a
young man apparently about eighteen or twenty years old came
and shook hands with me. I disclaimed his acquaintance, but he
assured me that he had seen me at several public meetings, and
his name was Van Scotten. I replied, "Why, you are only out of
the body little over two months, and I know your father and
mother well." He said, "That is the reason I came to you, and
please tell them I am all right, and no need to grieve for me." For
the previous few seconds I felt his hands slowly drawing from
mine, which soon became a strong pull, I keeping m}^ eyes on him
steadily all the while ; and there in front of me was the form and
features of the young man changing rapidly to that of Mrs. Miller
the medium ; a clear case of transfiguration. The light was strong
enough to see the form and clothing distinctly, of first the young
man and [then the] gradual change to that of Mrs. Miller. Again
I have seen her arm thrust through a chair or other solid article
of furniture, and when I grasped her hand the arm seemed to
dematerialise, while the chair or other article fell off. Then I have
seen the objectifying of lace and white embroidered garments, by
the temporary forms or the entranced medium • yard after yard
of fine delicate lace made generally from a small nucleus of white
light in the palm of the hand; piece after piece of the wonderful
fabric handed to the sitters, with the injunction to hold on to it,
but two minutes or less was the limit they could retain it. This
was done to illustrate how the white garments of the ladies as well
as the magnificent robes of bishops and clowns succeeded each other
in dazzling array at these remarkable sittings.
William More.
Miss Johnson adds :
I met Mr. More, who is a convinced Spiritualist, and had a long
talk with him about his experiences. I cross-questioned him
especially about the case of " transfiguration " when the form and
features of the young man changed into those of Mrs. Miller. He
assured me that he saw the young man's face in a perfectly clear
and distinct manner; there could be no doubt but that it was a
man's face; and he spoke like a man. It was while he was
LVI.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 473
actually looking into the face that he saw the change come over it,
as it turned into the face of Mrs. Miller, which he then saw as
clearly and distinctly as he had seen the man's face.
I enquired about the clothing of the form. Mr. More said the
young man was dressed in ordinary man's clothes, but when the
form changed into that of Mrs. Miller, he saw that she was wearing
ordinary woman's clothing and not drapery of any kind.
Alice Johnson.
Many more instances of the kind might of course be adduced.
In estimating their evidential value we must first of all bear
in mind the circumstance that the presumption against the
genuineness of professional " materialisation " seances in America
is overwhelming. In view of this fact we should, I think,
neither attach particular importance to prima facie enigmatic
incidents scattered here and there in the sitters' accounts
(unless these accounts be drawn up by persons peculiarly
qualified), nor credit the so often exposed trickster who styles
himself a materialising medium with any genuine uncommon
power without very serious reasons. Fraud without any
admixture is the most probable explanation, which must be
abandoned only when irresistibly proved to have been inadequate.
As for the " recognitions " themselves, I see no reason to
think that, in most cases at least, the medium himself or
herself does not play in them a purely passive part. My
grounds for this opinion are that these '''
recognitions " at
materialising seances are precisely similar to " recognitions " in
the domain of so-called " spirit-photography," where it is certain
that, in many cases at least, the illusion which gave rise to
the identification of a photograph as the image of a departed
friend sprang from the sitter himself without any prompting-
whatever from any one. 1
Not only so, but we even know
that after Buguet, the famous French " spirit photographer," had
confessed in the course of his trial that he had practised trickery
throughout, many, if not most of his dupes, found it impossible
to relinquish their faith, on the ground that they had obtained
at their sittings with him unmistakable likenesses of those
dear to them. When we take into account that the conditions

474 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [pakt
under which these " spirit-photographs " were generally taken
were far less sensational and awe-inspiring than those of a
sitting for materialisation (and, I believe, were even sometimes
taken in the sitters' absence and sent them by post), I find
that such " recognitions " a tete reposic, and to which the
Spiritualists in question afterwards so obstinately clung under
the prosaic conditions of every-day life, are much more to be
wondered at than those taking place under far more propitious
circumstances from the emotional point of view : only imagine
" the darkened room, the music, the singing, the pervading hush
of expectation, the intensely concentrated attention, the strained
gaze at the dark cabinet and at its white-robed apparitions. ..." 1
No wonder at all if under such circumstances a strongly
marked illusion, if not a pure hallucination, occurs now and
then, and the sitter really and truly believes himself to be-
hold a deceased friend or relation true to a line, and then,
when his state of emotion has begun to subside, thinks (as
in Mr. More's case) that he really sees the features of the
apparition gradually merge into those of the medium.2
Such

Here is a case where such an impression of " transfiguration " was obviously
purely spontaneous. Mr. W. B. Hodgson, a young journalist, writes to Miss
Johnson (to whose kindness I am indebted for this case also) on May 23rd, 1905 :
" The experience I mentioned in our conversation the other day happened
about seven years ago.
I was in the office of a newspaper in the City, the room being on the top
floor with large windows, so that the light was good. The door opened,
and some one entered. As he must have passed through the outer office the
presumption was that it was some one I knew. I looked at him and jumped
to the conclusion that it was a friend I had not seen for a long time. . . .
I rose, walked towards him with hand stretched out, and welcomed him. I
seemed to see the face of my friend quite clearly. But as I got within a yard
or so, the face of my friend seemed visibly to melt, and the outlines of the
features to fuse as though they had been wax before a strong fire. For an
instant there was chaos, and then there emerged the features of a total stranger,
and I saw I had been mistaken.
The mistake strongly impressed me at the time, especially the way in which
the features of my friend suddenly seemed to flow into the new form of the
stranger. I suppose that upon some trivial point of resemblance (which I was
unable to identify) I had built up a mental image which lasted till the
impression of the real approaching face grew too strong to be denied.
At this distance of time I cannot recall the name of the imaginary friend,
nor the business of the real stranger—only the one fact of the apparent
'fusing' of the features. I suffer from myopia and astigmatism, and use
slightly concave glasses for distant vision. ..."
lvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 475
facts are not open to doubt, but what we want to know is,
whether they may not be of a purely spontaneous character
rather than of external origin ; and whether they can assume a
collective character.
Comparison of " recognitions " in the realm of spirit photo-
graphy and in that of materialisation conclusively shows us,
I think, that we need not necessarily look to such an external
origin for an explanation.
Still, that repeated verbal suggestion, especially with " trained
"
sitters, can occasionally, as might a priori be expected, bring
about some positive results, I do not deny ; and beg to refer
the reader in this connection to Professor Harlow Gale's " Study
in Spiritistic Hallucinations," printed in the Proceedings S.P.P.,
Vol. XY., pp. 65-82. But I think that any impartial reader,
after studying the evidence adduced by Professor Gale, will agree
with me that on the whole these results are meagre, and cannot
in any degree bear comparison with the incidents of an ordinary
seance for physical phenomena or " materialisation."
1
On the whole, therefore, though I think there is some
evidence that in certain cases false sense-perceptions can shape
and colour the sitter's impressions at a spiritistic seance, I do
not think we must generalise from such incidents, or that we
should build on them a theory of such " phenomena " as
Home's.
And though I do not deny that such false sense-perceptions
can occasionally be induced from without, i.e. by the medium,
I see every reason to believe that very similar illusions can
originate in men and women under conditions which practically
exclude the possibility of external suggestion.
Still, in some very exceptional cases (e.g. that of Sambor's
chair-threading) I am ready to admit that illusion induced by the
medium is the most reasonable explanation, but I admit it only
provisionally, and because on the one hand the possibility of
conjuring under such conditions does not seem to me sufficiently
1
Thus some of "Dr. S.'s" (the medium's) habituds saw figures equally well
with hands held before the eyes, or with eyes closed ; some never saw any-
thing ; others would see the "face transfiguration" only "on fixating with
effort and extreme tension;" some had already seen "figures" before making
Dr. S.'s acquaintance (pp. 77-79). I think it may be said in all impartiality
that the residuum left after all this discounting is small, when al the accompany-
ing circumstances are taken into account.
476 Count Perovshy-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part
proved, and, on the other, because we have, broadly speaking, no
other evidence (I mean, no irrefutable evidence) of the occurrence
of the phenomenon in question.
As for the possibility of the medium being able to induce
a collective hallucination in several sitters in the waking state
at once, I see no good evidence for it. Barring, as I said
in the beginning of my paper, and for the reasons there specified,
Eastern conjuring, I see no reason to think that any one has
ever been able to make a roomful of people, or even three or four
persons believe (if sitting in the light) that he was holding-
red-hot coals or floating in the air, if in fact he was doing
nothing of the kind. I do not think we have any grounds
for admitting that Home could have caused Lords Lindsay and
Adare and Captain Wynne to see him outside the window when
he was inside the room, nor that he could have caused three
persons to see the form of his late wife leaning against him,
if all around him there was but empty space. Let us remember
that in his case alone, to mention no others, such an assumption
has been repeatedly proved to stand in direct contradiction to
facts. And before believing anything of the kind possible we
must insist on new and good evidence.
The hallucination hypothesis should also, I think, be avoided
unless urgently necessary for another reason. Once we have
admitted it (or at least the hypothesis of collective and induced
hallucination) in one case, we see that, unless we refuse to be
consistent and do not draw a purely arbitrary line somewhere
quite illogically, it will quickly lead us into the region of infinite
doubt. If a medium can cause several sitters to believe they
see a materialised hand where there is only " viewless air
;
"
or that they behold him floating in space when he has not
left his chair, we are logically bound to infer that he may
also prevent their seeing some actions of his or even his own
person,—may, in fact, induce in them not only positive, but
also negative hallucinations. For I wonder on what grounds
we could declare such a thing impossible ? I consequently
submit that, if Nikolaeff was able to engender in his six sitters
the belief that they saw luminous hands first gradually forming

them from seeing how he himself pulled off the silk lamp-shade
and threw it towards the six doctors. So must Home have
been able to induce in his clients the belief that certain actions
(for instance, " direct writing " in Mr. Burr's case) were per-
formed under their eyes by materialised hands, when in fact
he did these things himself, merely suggesting a negative
hallucination to the persons present. Why is one supposition
more improbable than the other ? But see to what straits we
should finally be driven if we adopt this one. In a region
where serious investigation worthy of the name is already so
difficult, not to say almost impossible, we shall finally hopelessly
entangle ourselves in the factitious obstacles we are cheerfully
raising with a fertility of imagination—I think, misdirected
—
which may well evoke admiration.
For my own part I lay it down as a general proposition,
—
and I consider that I am entitled to it, not only by the every-
day experience of mankind for many centuries, but also by
the study of these so-called " Physical Phenomena," whether
fraudulent or genuine,—that the testimony of several sane,
honest and intelligent eye-witnesses is, broadly speaking, proof
of the objectivity of any phenomenon. If there are people
who maintain an opposite view, why, let them make experiments
themselves.
There may be and often is on the part of these several
eye-witnesses misinterpretation of the object seen ; distortion
(in the retrospect) of the impressions primarily received ;.
occasionally a pure hallucination of memory perhaps ;
but, I
repeat, I do not think we have serious grounds for believing
they can be made to see something non-existent. Nor do
1 think we are entitled to suppose that such " misinterpretation
"
of a real scene or object can assume in several persons
(intelligent and sane !) such gigantic proportions as, for instance,
to make them mistake a man who simply " thrust his head
and shoulders out of the window
" 1
for a man floating in the
air outside the window. For what, I ask, would be the difference
between such an "illusion" and a pure "hallucination?" Evidence
that such things are possible may be forthcoming some day.
As yet I see very little of it.
But, it may be asked, did I not say at the beginning of my
1

478 Count Perovshy-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part
paper that no one who has studied the evidence collected by
the S.P.R. can doubt the existence of collective hallucinations ?
Nor do I doubt it. But these are hallucinations either
spontaneously originating in one person and transmitted, so
to say, to another, or telepathically induced by a third person
at a distance. And then, il faut nous entendre. Personally
I should not be at '
all disinclined to invite those who shared
in such a strange and collective experience to prove that it
was of a hallucinatory character, though such a request could
hardly be complied with in most cases. And I should have
made my invitation especially pressing in connection with
certain cases of " apparitions " seen in haunted houses. If
I agree to call them hallucinatory, it is on my part almost
exclusively a matter of courtesy !
1
Were I now asked whether, if I decline to explain away
by false sense-perception most of the cases mentioned in my
paper, it must follow that I fully believe in their genuineness,
I should certainly answer :
" No."
Impressed as I am, in common, I believe, with all serious
students of the subject, with much of the Home evidence, I
cannot but think that it presents serious drawbacks. The
remoteness of the "incidents" and the impossibility of repetition
where there is such urgent need for it ; the almost unlimited
possibilities of conjuring ; the numberless exposures of other
mediums ; the fact that a great many and probably most of
Home's clients seem to have been by no means scientifi-
cally qualified for an investigation of his claims, and that
their testimony may be worth not more than that of many
Spiritualists of the present day, which we are bound to reject
without hesitation (for in this curious region the most positive
statement coming from the most honourable and —in general
worldly matters—the most sane man may be absolutely value-
less) ; the part which may have been played now and then
'"This hypothesis ["that the apparition is something belonging to the
external world"; "that like ordinary matter it occupies and moves through
space"] involves us in many difficulties. . . . Nevertheless I am bound to
admit that there is some little evidence tending to suggest this theory. For
instance ... A considerable amount of clear evidence to the appearance of
ghosts to independent observers in successive points in space would certainly
afford a strong argument for their having a definite relation to space " (Mrs.
Sidgwick in Proceedings S.P.B., Vol. III., p. 146).

;

the frequent looseness of the conditions
at the sittings (in many cases it is practically certain Home
could have imposed any conditions he chose) ;
finally, the
fact that even his career, however different in this respect
from that of other physical mediums, is not entirely free
from suspicious incidents :
—all these circumstances stand very
much in the way of our definitely accepting Home's phenomena
as genuine. And as years roll by and no worthy successor
of his appears on the public stage ; as new and hitherto
unsuspected sources of error spring into view ; as the general
unreliability in such matters of almost all persons except
specially qualified experts becomes more and more obvious,
2
scepticism appears more and more legitimate and natural,
even when it extends to facts in the past which may have
seemed impregnable for many a decade.
It seems to me that for very obstinate disbelievers in
" Physical Phenomena " such a line of argument (though I
do not say I am quite in sympathy with it) may yet prove
more fruitful than a theory built, so to say, " in the air,"
and for which support is to be sought in some measure even
in the cabinet of the American materialising medium ! And
after they have framed on these lines any provisional negative
conclusions, let them and all of us possess our souls in
patience in the hope that a day will come when a second
Home will triumphantly reverse these conclusions !

I subjoin an account of a case of table movements apparently
without contact. The narrator, M. Schilkine, has been known to
me for some eighteen years; he is of an open, intelligent and
critical mind, though by no means hypercritical ; in fact a good
witness of transparent honesty and sufficient sagacity. I think
it very probable that the " movements " he describes were
genuine, and can only consider the tricks played by M. K. on

other occasions an unfortunate circumstance not necessarily
vitiating the case under consideration. Still that frequent
unreliability of unpaid mediums is both curious and dis-
heartening !
M. Schilkine writes :
Awil, 1906.
Durant les hivers des annees 1896 et 1897 nous avions forme un
petit cercle, arm d'observer les phenomenes spirites, dans une serie
de seances organisees avec toute la circonspection que ce genre
d'etude necessite. Outre les soussignes, nous admettions parfois dans
nos reunions des personnes de notre connaissance et notamment
un jeune officier du regiment de Novotcherkask, M. P. K., tue en
1905 a Mukden. M. K. paraissait done d'une force mediumique
considerable et donnait pendant nos seances les signes caracteristiques
de la transe mediumique. Le probleme que nous nous etions pro-
pose, entre autres, etait d'obtenir le mouvement des objets par la
force mediumique seule, sans contact et dans des conditions qui
excluraient toute incertitude quant a la realite et l'authenticite des
manifestations. Nous employions pour nos experiences une petite
table a trois pieds. Au debut, les mouvements ne se produisaient
qu'avec le contact de nos mains unies en chaine mediumique. Dans
la suite, sans rompre la chaine, nous essayames de lever nos mains
de dessus la table, en priant les esprits d'en continuer le mouvement.
Nous avons reussi a l'avoir, mais presque toujours dans une obscurite
plus ou moins complete. Nous constations le mouvement, soit au
bruit que les pieds de la table faisaient en glissant sur le parquet,
soit au contact dont elle effleurait nos genoux et nos pieds,
pendant ses oscillations. Souvent la table tombait sur les genoux
de quelqu'un d'entre nous, se relevait pour retomber sur ceux d'une
autre personne, et ainsi de suite. Lorsque le phenomene faiblissait
nous remettions nos mains sur la table pour lui communiquer la
force necessaire, et les mouvements reprenaient aussitot.
Enfin, a l'une des seances de l'annee 1896 (nos souvenirs varient
entre les dates du 28 octobre et du 18 novembre) sur le conseil des
" esprits " obtenu au moyen du proced6 de l'alphabet, nous avons
allume une lanterne rouge (de celles qui servent pour le developpe-
ment des plaques photographiques), et nous avons vu les mouvements
de la table, libre de tout contact. La seance avait lieu dans le
logement de MM. Schilkine, et dans la piece, oil la manifestation
s'est produite, en plus des soussignes, se trouvait M. P. K., en proie
a sa transe habituelle, et etendu dans un fauteuil, distant de la

table en question, de trois a quatre metres, au moins. Les soussignes
se tenaient debout autour de la table, les mains en chaine mediumique
et elevees d'un demi-metre au-dessus de la table. Nous nous voyions
de la tete aux pieds et ne pouvions manquer de nous convaincre que
rien ni personne ne touchait a la table. A notre priere, les mouve-
ments se produisirent ; la table glissa sur le parquet, en se penchant
de tous les cotes, comme si elle prenait son elan. —enrin elle se
soiileva completement de terre, de ses trois pieds, et se maintint a
une hauteur de dix a vingt centimetres, pendant deux, trois secondes.
Nous avons remarque que le mouvement de nos mains en l'air
avivait celui de la table, en la dirigeant du cote voulu.
Cette manifestation ne se repeta plus dans des conditions de
controle aussi scrupuleusement certaines.

I send you an account of our experiments on table-movements. . . .
For the complete truth of all we have written down we can vouch.
We have also recalled many interesting things, partly even written
down at the time by Mme. Zakrzevska ; but unfortunately mutual
confidence played too great a part in all that for the occurrences
at our sittings to be convincing, not to ourselves on!}', but to
strangers. . . .
(2) Extract from M. Schilkine's letter to me, dated May 2/15.
The late K. did, in fact, confess to us having, by way of a joke,
simulated mediumistic phenomena in some circle (some relations of
his, I think, so as to "scare" old people: I cannot recall it for
certain) ; still with us he always was extremely serious, and seemed
to value much the reputation of an interesting medium. This did
not prevent us from suspecting in some cases that precisely in order
to sustain his reputation he, like apparently most other mediums,
could not deny himself the pleasure of acting as an assistant to
the spirits— and a more eager one than from our standpoint would
have seemed desirable. Still, I must honestly confess that K. was
never directly caught simulating phenomena; and our suspicions
are based on the same "internal conviction" as many suspicions about
other mediums with whom I had experiences later on together
with you.

As for the table phenomenon we have described in particular—it
is positively impossible to suspect K. of anything in this case : he
was too far away from the table, and owing to the conditions of
the seance, and to the carefulness of the control (which was the
greater, since we always had in view the inclination to " augment
"
phenomena proper to mediums), it is quite impossible to suppose
some mechanical appliances with which K. could have moved and
raised into the air the table 1
from a distance. The table was ours
(it is in my rooms still); during the phenomenon we were rather
closely surrounding it, there was light in the room. The most adroit
conjuror could not have done anything under these conditions.
The seance described is precisely interesting in this—that even if
three persons out of those present had agreed by combined endeavours
to deceive the fourth, it is my profound conviction that they would
not have succeeded in producing the phenomenon of table-moving
in the way it occurred.
It must be noted that K.'s presence at our sittings was not a
necessary condition of their success. We had phenomena without
him ; but the "physical" phenomena proper were rarer and weaker.
At first K. sat with us in the chain. Once the "spirits" demanded
that he should sit at a distance outside the chain. We were glad
it was so, and later on we generally insisted that sittings should
take place precisely in this wr
ay (of course when there was enough
light in the room to see the sitters).
In conclusion I will take the liberty to reassert that if we were
of " sound mind and firm memory " 2
during the seance described,
the movements of the table must undoubtedly be considered as
occurring without any contact whatsoever. . . .

THE EDUCATION OF THE SITTER.
By Alice Johnson.
Introduction.
It has been suggested that I should contribute to the dis-
cussion initiated by Count Solovovo on the possible part played
by hallucination and illusion in producing supposed " physical
phenomena," and I follow his lead in trying to trace these
agencies especially in the case of Home.
The greater part of the evidence in this case is useless for
our purposes, since the accounts of individual incidents are
extraordinarily meagre in themselves, and accounts given by
different witnesses of the same incident vary so much as to
suggest that no reliance can be placed on any of them, and
that consequently no definite conclusions, either positive or
negative, can be drawn from them.
Two notable exceptions to this general statement are, how-
ever, to be found in the evidence of two witnesses, Sir William
Crookes and Lord Adare (now Lord Dunraven). The former
recounts the facts from the more objective point of view of the
man of science; the latter from the more subjective point of
view of the cultivated man interested in philosophy and religion.
Hence it is the latter case that affords us the best insight
into the psychology of the sitter, and Lord Adare's Experiences
in Spiritualism with Air. D. D. Home is a valuable psycho-
logical document, for in the long series of events happening
to one person, and recorded by him pretty fully and almost
contemporaneously, enough details are given to show us, as it
appears to me, how his mind became gradually educated under
the influence and by the suggestions of the medium. " And
484 Alice Johnson. [part
if these things are done in the green tree, what shall be done
in the dry ?
" To illustrate my arguments, therefore, I use
chiefly instances taken from Lord Adare's book.
But first one remark is necessary to guard against possible
misapprehensions. It is difficult to obtain an unimpassioned
hearing for the hypothesis that a certain number of alleged
physical phenomena can be explained as hallucinations or illu-
sions experienced by the sitters, because there are still many
persons who cannot disabuse themselves of the idea that to
suggest that a man has had a hallucination is tantamount to
an accusation of want of mental balance. It is of course true
that some persons of unbalanced mind are liable to hallucina-
tions, though many other unbalanced persons are not. But it
is equally true, and must be well known to readers of Phantasms
of the Living and of our Proceedings that many of those who
have experienced hallucinations are at least up to the average
of mankind in intellectual capacity and sanity. " Calculating
boys " are sometimes imbecile ; but we should not argue from
that that the mathematical faculty was in itself a morbid
symptom. Hallucinations, too, are occasionally associated with
morbid physical conditions, but in that case they are
generally of different types from those which occur to people
in normal conditions.
1
In fact, the process of hallucination is in itself, as Mr.
Myers insists in his chapter on " Sensory Automatism " in
Human Personality, an expansion of a natural faculty—the
faculty for visualising or externalising ideas that exist con-
sciously or subconsciously in the mind ; and this faculty may
be utilised as a means of psychological study. We have
now come to the stage at which motor automatism may be
considered on its own merits. If it is said that a member
of the S.P.B. Council writes automatically, the statement is
not supposed to convey a covert insult to that member. Why
should it be thought more insulting to suggest that a member
of the Council or of any other scientific body may visualise
automatically ?
Certain kinds of visual automatisms may, it is true, be
attributed to such a person without offence. It would be

LVI.] The Education of the Sitter. 485
permissible to say that he had seen an apparition of an
absent friend, i.e., that he had seen a person who was
not there. It should then be equally permissible to suggest
that if he saw a person suspended in the air, that person
might have been standing on the ground. For, whereas
the first case would be a hallucination, the second would only
be an illusion ;
that is, in the first case the perception would
be much more at variance with the external facts than in the
second. The fact is that every one may occasionally experience
a hallucination, and every one is constantly liable to illusions
;
and no intellectual discredit can attach to either. The question
of intellectual capacity comes in only in relation to inferences
drawn from one's perceptions.
Here we touch on the fundamental difference between the
evidence for psychical and that for physical phenomena. In the
former case, we are dealing primarily with mental impressions ;
in the latter with the inferences drawn from mental impressions
as to external physical facts. The latter case, then, introduces
many possibilities of error which cannot occur in the former.
I have argued this point fully in my paper on " Sittings for
Physical Phenomena in America " (Proceedings, Part LIV., pp.
128-131) and need not repeat it here.
In the purely psychical cases, people do not as a rule draw wrong-
inferences as to external facts. The man who sees an apparition
is not likely to infer that the person represented by it is actually
present, because such a mistake could generally be easily corrected.
He is only concerned in the first instance with his own mental
impression, and this can be ascertained and noted before and
independently of any enquiry as to the relation it may or may
not have with some external event, such as the death of the
person represented. If, however, our hypothetical percipient
sees a man rise unsupported in the air, his first thought might
naturally be to infer that the man did rise, and the burden of
the enquiry is at once shifted to the question whether this
inference is correct. We cannot here first note the mental
impression and then go on independently to examine the external
fact to which it is supposed to correspond, for there may be
no evidence for the fact beyond the mental, impression.
Consequently it is, as a rule, much more difficult to prove
that an alleged " physical phenomenon " has taken place than
2h
486 Alice Johnson. [part
to prove, say, a case of telepathy ; for the former depends much
more often than the latter on the unsupported testimony of the
senses.
In ordinary life we are constantly testing and correcting the
direct testimony of our senses through the repetition of experi-
ences under varying conditions, so that by striking a sort of
average, we get a roughly reliable result. In the case of
" physical phenomena " there may often be no opportunity for
the necessary tests or corrections, and consequently grave reason
to distrust the pronouncement of the senses regarding them.
In order to establish any new facts, it is necessary to criticise
the evidence as stringently as possible. The superficial observer
is apt to think that criticism tends to discourage the worker and
to confine and obstruct advance. I believe that in the long run
its effect is exactly the reverse. I believe that by the severity
of our criticism of the evidence for telepathy from the living and
from the dead we have actually both stimulated its production
and improved its quality. It seems to me therefore worth while
to point out certain flaws in what has generally been regarded as
the best evidence for physical phenomena, in the hope that fresh
evidence free from the flaws inherent in this may be forthcoming.
Coming to the consideration of concrete cases, we find com-
paratively few to which the hypothesis of hallucination can be
applied ; the more practical question is whether illusions, which
are of course far commoner than hallucinations, cannot account
for a good many of the cases that are not to be explained by
fraud.
Home's " Spirit-hands."
In the case of Home's " spirit-hands," Count Solovovo argues
that, though certain features (especially the fact that they
were sometimes invisible to some of the persons present) sug-
gested that they were hallucinatory, others (notably the fact
that objects were often moved by them from one place to
another) seemed to show that, whether fraudulent or genuine,
they were objective. Yet the hands that moved objects were
also occasionally invisible to some persons present. This
—
according to Count Solovovo—tends to prove that in all cases,
even when invisible, the " spirit-hands " were objective.
lvl] The Education of the Sitter. 487
I should like to point out, first, the a priori difficulties
of regarding these hands as genuinely supernormal. One
hesitates to accept the alleged facts of " materialisation
"
because it is entirely contrary to ordinary experience that
matter should suddenly become organised and as suddenly
become disorganised and dissipated from no apparent cause.
Consequently, a great deal of excellent evidence would be
required to justify a belief in such a fact.
Still, in the case of some of the spirit-hands referred to by
Count Solovovo, the temporary organism, so long as it exists,
behaves like any other matter. Thus, the hand carries a
flower across the room—as any other hand might—over-
coming apparently by its own muscular force the force of
gravity and the resistance of the air. Then it apparently
dissolves into nothing.
But we meet with an altogether different problem and a
phenomenon still more remote from our ordinary experience
when we find that the spirit-hand that carries the flower
appears to one person like a hand, to another like a luminous
cloud, while to a third it is invisible altogether. Here is a
kind of matter which is not only temporary in character—
a
fact in itself extraordinary enough—but exhibits another quite
unprecedented characteristic in the arbitrary selectiveness of
its effects on other matter. In order to be visible at all, it
must reflect light. How does it manage to reflect light that
affects the retina of one person and not the retina of another ?
We may reply that the difference must lie in the retinae, one
being more sensitive than the other. But we do not find the
same difference of sensitivity in regard to the light reflected
from ordinary objects. It seems to follow then that the light
reflected from the spirit-hancl is a peculiar kind of light, lying
outside the limits of the ordinary visible spectrum. But in
that case, why is not the person with the more sensitive
retina constantly affected by it ? For of course all ordinary
objects are constantly giving off radiations outside the limits of
the visible spectrum ; but our supposed sensitive apparently
does not perceive them.
We then seem driven to suppose that not only does the
spirit-hand consist of matter of a temporary kind, but that
while it exists, it exhibits all sorts of unaccountable excep-
488 Alice Johnson. [part
tions to the ordinary behaviour of matter, for each one of
which we have to postulate a separate explanation, while
for none of these explanations is there any evidence beyond
the special facts which it is called in to explain.
Admitting, however, that the " spirit-hands " that moved
objects were objective, if only temporarily so, let us consider
whether the different impressions they produced on different
sitters were not due to these latter being differently situated
for normal perception.
In the first case (apart from the statements of Home) quoted
by Count Solovovo, the room being " lighted by means of two
spirit lamps with soda flames placed on the top of the gaselier"
(Proceedings, Vol. VI. p. 116), Lady Crookes saw a hand
appear from under the table between her and Home carrying
a piece of grass 1 5 ins. long, •
with which it tapped her
shoulder. The other sitters only saw the grass moved, but
from their position, as shown in the plan (on p. 115), it seems
probable that the hand would normally have been hidden
from them by the table or by Home himself intervening.
In the second case (pp. cit. p. 120), the room being-
illuminated by two spirit-lamps (as stated on p. 117), or by
three (as stated on p. 118), Lady Crookes was the only one
to see the hand touching the flower in Home's button-hole
;
but as she was sitting next to him, she must have been
in the most favourable position for seeing it.
Again, at the same seance (p. 121) "a hand was seen by
some and a luminous cloud by others, pulling the flowers
about." The mention here of a "luminous cloud," and on
the previous page of a " luminous hand," suggests that the
light given by the two (or three) spirit-lamps must have
been very dim, or this luminous appearance could hardly have
been perceived. Here again it seems possible that the varying
impressions of the sitters may have been due simply to some
having better sight than others, or being in a better position
for seeing.
And so on through all the cases referred to by Count
Solovovo. If these hands had been completely invisible to
some person with normal sight looking directly at them in
a good light, we should then have good evidence that they
were hallucinatory. The amount of variation in their appear-
LVI.] The Education of the Sitter. 489
ance does not seem to me to show that there was anything
abnormal about them, i.e. anything inconsistent with the
supposition that -they were either Home's own hands or dummy
hands.
This, in fact, seems to be practically Count Solovovo's view.
As he remarks, we have at least one very suspicious case
on record (that recorded by Mr. Merrifield in the Journal
S.P.E., Vol. XI. p. 76, May 1903); and I do not remem-
ber any case in which the hands were observed by touch as
well as by sight to be completely detached, except in the
account by Mr. Burr, quoted by Count Solovovo.
And in this connection it seems to me very significant that
there is such a marked difference between the account written
—or at all events published—in 1863 (in Home's Incidents
in My Life, pp. 59-61), eight years after the event, and
that written in 1887, thirty-two years after the event. The
incidents seem to have grown amazingly in Mr. Burr's recol-
lection in the interval. If he really subjected the hand to
the stringent and conclusive tests mentioned in his second
account, what possible reason can he have had for omitting
to refer to them in any way in his first account ? The
objective nature of the hand seems well established in both
accounts ; those circumstances which would establish its in-
dependence of the medium are mentioned only in the second.
For the appearance of a hand ending at the wrist could, of
course, be produced by the well-known trick of covering the
rest of the arm with a dark cloth.
In the case of Nikolaeff again (quoted by Count Solovovo,
p. 449, above), the objective character of the hands seems well
established, while the main evidence for their supernormal
character seems to be that the sitters thought they saw the
medium's hands at the same time. Whether or not these latter
were dummy hands, the evidence is insufficient to show.
Home's " Pull-form Phantasms."
As to the " full-form phantasms," I have nothing to add
to Count Solovovo's forcible description of the effect of Home's
repeated suggestions on Lord Adare's mind, except that I see
no reason why the same medium should not use different methods
on different occasions, according as each seems best calculated
400 Alice Johnson. [part
to produce the effect at which he is aiming. If suggestion
fails (and, as I shall show later, there is evidence of its fairly
frequent failure in Home's case), why not fall back on
mechanism, when it can be used without too much risk ?
Thus the " spirit form " of Sacha, seen by Lord Adare,
Captain Gerard Smith, and Dr. Gully, may have been a col-
lective hallucination, or a material object ; the records are quite
insufficient to show which.
Again, in the case of the form seen at the seance of May
7th, 1873, the evidence is dubious. Mr. Stainton Moses,
apparently writing at the time or immediately afterwards
(Proceedings S.P.K., Vol. IX. p. 310), says that the room was
so dark that Home kept them informed of his position ;
" Now
Dan is here ; now Dan is touching the, etc., etc." He then
speaks of a hand (there is nothing in the account to prove
that this was not Home's hand) that played the accordion,
and later he describes a materialised form that " floated near
the folding doors and advanced towards Mrs. Crookes." Lady
Crookes's account (written twenty years later) shows consider-
able discrepancies with that of Mr. Moses. She describes the
light as sufficient " to show everything in the room distinctly
"
(why then did Home have to describe his position to the
sitters ?), and according to her it is the materialised form
which takes the accordion and approaches her playing it. In
the very brief account of what appears to be the same incident
by Sir W. Crookes {Researches in the Phenomena of Spiritualism,
p. 9 4), it is again said that " a phantom form . . . took an
accordion in its hand and then glided about the room playing
the instrument."
In general it seems to me impossible to draw any trustworthy
inferences from the details of occurrences which are described
by the different witnesses, or by the same witness at different
times, in very varying manners. And the very serious dis-
crepancies between the witnesses in such cases has been, I
think, too often overlooked, and even perhaps to some extent
overlooked by Count Solovovo.
Levitations.
To illustrate the way in which various sources of error,

observation or misdescription, and illusion,—may all be combined
in one incident, I will try to reconstruct from the sceptical
point of view one of the most famous events in Home's
career,—his alleged flight from one window to another at Ashley
House,—which Count Solovovo challenges the sceptic to explain.
In the first place, all the three witnesses, Captain Wynne,
Lord Adare, and the Master of Lindsay, had received suggestions
of various kinds betor*ehand, which had often been effective. For
instance, Captain Wynne (Experiences, p. 63) had been told that
certain sounds on his pillow and shaking of his bed were
spiritually produced, and that he would "soon be able to have
raps." Lord Adare and the Master of Lindsay afford two of
the most marked instances of " the general liability to purely
subjective hallucinations which seems (as Count Solovovo says)
to have been the speciality of many of Home's sitters." A few
examples of this have been quoted, but no one can read Lord
Adare's Experiences without being struck by the careful daily and
nightly training in suggestibility to which Home had subjected
him, apparently with considerable success. He seems to have tried
his hand with equally fortunate results on the Master of Lindsay.
Thus, on Nov. 20th, 1868 (p. 73), "Lindsay and Home heard
a voice, and we all heard a spirit moving about the room." Soon
afterwards Home " began speaking of the strange and horrible
influences about the Tower (Lindsay is quartered at the Tower).
He said,
1
They are very dreadful, but can do no harm ;
they
are obliged to remain at the Tower,'" and then went on to
describe several of them. " Turning to Lindsay, he said, '
You
will have a curious manifestation at the Tower, quite alone.'
Lindsay asked him about it. '
I must not tell you anything
about it.' " This reticence seems prudent, and, as might be
expected, a few days later (see p. 77), "Lindsay called; he
said that he had had strong manifestations that evening
when alone, and had been told to go to Ashley Place." At
the previous seance he had seen " spirit forms." At this one,
The room was nearly dark. We had physical manifestations.
Home went into a trance; he walked about the room for some
time, arranging the light and talking to himself; he then opened
the window, drawing the curtains, so that we could see nothing
but his head, and got outside the window. This frightened us, and
Lindsay wanted to stop him, but did not. Presently he came back
492 Alice Johnson. [part
and told us that we had no faith whatever, or we would not have
been alarmed for his safety. 1
Here seems to have been the first rehearsal of the scene
that was enacted with considerably more dramatic effect on the
next occasion. Later in the same seance, a discussion was carried
on between two supposed spirits, both speaking through Home,
as to how he might be lifted up in the air. It was arranged
that he should be lifted first on to the back of Lord Adare's
chair, and Lord Adare then felt his feet there, but was soon
obliged to let go of them, as he appeared to be lifted up and
carried to the other side of the room, when Lord Adare was
called over to him, " took his hand and felt him alight upon
the floor." This being done in complete darkness, there was
no evidence of any real levitation, but it probably served to-
prepare the minds of the sitters for the crowning effort, for
immediately afterwards, Home remarked (p. 79), " We will lift
Dan up again better presently and in a clearer light, so that
you can see better."
The next seance was the eventful one of Dec. 16th, 1868,'2
the sitters being Captain Wynne, the Master of Lindsay and Lord
Adare. There was no light in the room, except what little came
from the window. (The hour is not stated, but it seems as
usual to have been late at night.) Presently
Lindsay saw two spirits on the sofa and others in different places.
. . . A chair moved of itself from the wall up to the table between
Home and Charlie [Captain Wynne]. Charlie said he could feel
that there was some one there, but he saw nothing. Lindsay per-
1
The same incident is described rather more dramatically in Human Nature^
Vol. III. p. 50, by H. D. Jencken on the authority of "the Hon. the
M ," i.e. The Master of Lindsay. Mr. Jencken, writing in December,.
1868, says: "Mr. Home had placed himself at the window, which lie opened,,
and deliberately stepped upon the ledge outside, looking on to the street, some-
SO feet below, with utter unconcern. The Honourable the said he-
shuddered, alarmed at what he was witnessing. Mr. Home noticing this stepped
down and reproached his friend, saying :
'
Little faith, little faith ; Daniel will
not be injured !
'
"
2
The date of this stance is generally given thus ; but Lord Adare's account
(Experiences, p. 80) has the heading: "Seance at 5 Buckingham Gate, Wed-
nesday, December 16th," and opens with the words "On Sunday last, etc.'*
It seems then that the seance really took place on Sunday, December 13th,,
1868 ; and that the account was written ou the following Wednesday.
The Education of the Sitter. 493
ceived the figure in the chair, and said he was leaning his arm on
Charlie's shoulder. . . . [Home, in the character of this spirit] laid
Ids head upon my [Lord Adare's] hand on the table and sobbed
violently ; two or three tears fell upon my hand. Home: "Do you
feel how hot his tears are?" Adare: "Yes, I do." Home: "They
will leave a mark of blood upon your hand." . . . Home told me
to go into the next room and look if the tears had left any mark
upon my hand. I perceived a very slight red mark. When I
returned he told me to stretch out my hand. I did so, and Dannie
Cox [a spirit] touched it with the tip of his finger and said, through
Mr. Home, "You will see the marks plainer in the morning."
They were rather plainer, but still indistinct, when I awoke the next
day (pp. 80-82).
This little incident looks like a rudimentary case of stig-
matisation.1
Other instances of effects apparently similar to some
of the most commonplace effects of hypnotic suggestion will
be referred to below.
Eeturning to the central event of the seance, we find the
sitters now in good trim, with their minds well prepared to
accept any suggestion that may be made to them.
Home then got up and walked about the room. He was both
elongated and raised in the air [apparently in almost complete dark-
ness]. He spoke in a whisper, as though the spirits were arranging
something. He then said to us :
" Do not be afraid ; and on no
account leave your places
;
" and he went out into the passage.
Lindsay suddenly said :
" Oh, good heavens ! I know what he is
going to do; it is too fearful." Adare: "What is it?" Lindsay
"I cannot tell you, it is too horrible! Adah [Menken] says that I
must tell you ; he is going out of the window in the other room
and coming in at this window "
(p. 82).
Here then we see the sitters' minds raised to the highest
point of horrified expectancy, Home having uttered vague hints
of a possibility of this kind at a former sitting, and his hints
having been elaborated and formulated by the excited imagina-
tion of the Master of Lindsay. The narrative continues
:
We heard Home go into the next room, heard the window thrown
up, and presently Home appeared standing upright outside our

Personality, Vol. I. pp. 491-9.
494 Alice Johnson. [part
window; he opened the window and walked in quite coolly
(p. 82).
The Master of Lindsay's account, given to the Committee
•of the Dialectical Society on July 6th, 1869, is:
Home . . . first went into a trance and walked about uneasily ;
he then went into the hall; while he was away I heard a voice
whisper in my ear, " He will go out of one window and in at
-another." I was alarmed and shocked at the idea of so dangerous
an experiment. I told the company what I had heard, and we
then waited for Home's return. Shortly after he entered the room.
I heard the window go up, but I could not see it, for I sat with my
back to it. I however saw his shadow on the opposite wall ; he
went out of the window in a horizontal position, and I saw him
outside the other window (that in the next room) floating in the air. 1
It is difficult to understand how the Master of Lindsay,
sitting with his back to the window of one room, could have
seen Home floating outside the window of the other room.
We can only suppose that he is describing what he imagined
was happening, not what he saw.
Similarly Captain Wynne, writing to Home on February 2nd,
1877, gives no description of what he saw but merely says:
I was present and a witness. . . . The fact of your having gone
out of the window and in at the other I can swear to . . ?
Here arain is an obvious confusion between observation and
O
inference, as none of the witnesses was in a position to see
Home go out of the first window.
Writing of the same incident on July 14th, 1871, the
Master of Lindsay says :
We heard the window in the next room lifted up, and almost
immediately after we saw Home floating in the air outside our
window. The moon was shining full into the room ;
my back was
to the light, and I saw the shadow on the wall of the window-sill
and Home's feet about six inches above it. He remained in this
position for a few seconds, then raised the window and glided into
the room feet foremost and sat down.3

LVI.] The Education of the Sitter. 495
In regard to the moonlight, Mr. Podmore points out that
the seance took place on Dec. 16th, 1868, two days after
new moon,1
and Lord Adare, whose account seems to be almost
contemporary, says that immediately afterwards he went into
the next room with Home, who professed then to show him
how he had gone out of the first window. He appeared to be
swung out and in, but " it was so dark I could not see
clearly how he was supported outside" {Experiences, p. 83),
though there seems no reason to suppose it was not on the
stone balustrade.
Later in the seance " Lindsay and Charlie saw tongues or
jets of flames proceeding from Home's head. We then all
distinctly heard, as it were, a bird flying round the room,
whistling and chirping, but saw nothing, except Lindsay, who
perceived an indistinct form resembling a bird" {op. cit., p. 83).
These incidents seem to have been hallucinatory, since they
were not perceptible to all the sitters, and, if so, further
evidence of a generally suggestible condition on their part is
furnished.
As to the levitation which Count Solovovo challenges us to
explain, two hypotheses may occur to the reader. The rooms,
says Lord Adare, were on the third floor of the house. Outside
each window was a small balcony or ledge, 19 inches deep,
bounded by balustrades, 18 inches high. The space between
the balustrades of the two windows measured 7 ft. 4 ins.,
so that Home could not normally have passed outside the
house from one to the other unaided. He might, however,
have done so by means of a board laid across from
one balustrade to the other,
2
or by a ladder, but this would
probably have involved an accomplice. A far more probable
hypothesis is that he did not go outside at all, but crept
back noiselessly into the room he had just left, made his
way round in the darkness to the window, and then
mounted on to the window-sill, standing inside, while the
spectators believed him to be outside the window. He might

from an almanac of 1S6S that new moon was on Dec. 13th.

As far as I can understand from the record, though it is not quite clear on
this point, Home was staying in the house at the time, and so must have had
opportunities of making preparations.
496 Alice Johnson. [part
then have opened the window and stepped down into the
room, thus giving them the impression that he had come in
through the window.
This illusion would not, I think, be difficult to produce in
the almost complete darkness of such a sitting. I have tested
my own capacity for determining, under rather better condi-
tions of light, whether a man who was standing on a window-
sill, was outside the window or inside it, and I found that
I could not see on which side he was. In Home's case the
sitters had been led to expect that he would appear outside
the window, which, it is to be noted, they were forbidden to
approach, for Home had said to them before he left the room,.
" On no account leave your places." It must also be noted
that, if Home had tried to produce the illusion by this
means and failed—if, that is, the sitters had perceived that he
was inside and not outside—no harm would have been done, for
he could easily have passed it off by saying there was not
" power " enough to do it that night and making some excuse,,
if one was demanded, for his position.
The importance that has been attached to this case seems
to me to have arisen merely from its sensational character,,
because it looked as if a great risk had been run. Eviden-
tially, it is not strong ; for it occurred in a very bad light,
and to three witnesses of suggestible temperament, whose
minds had been carefully and skilfully prepared beforehand,
and who experienced undoubted hallucinations at this very
sitting both before and after the " levitation."
The two instances of levitation recorded by Sir W. Crookes
(Proceedings S.P.E., Vol. VI. pp. 119 and 126) are far stronger,
for they seemed to have occurred in fairly good light, though
they too may possibly be explained as collective visual illusions.
On the other hand, this explanation can hardly apply to two
other instances described very briefly by Sir William Crookes
at a meeting of the Society on Oct. 26th, 1894 (see Journal
S.P.B., Vol. VI. p. 342), as follows:
On another occasion I was invited to come to him [Home], when
he rose 18 inches off the ground, and I passed my hands under his
feet, round him, and over his head when he was in the air.
On several occasions Home and the chair on which he was sitting
at the table rose off the ground. This was generally done very
LVI.] The Education of the Sitter. 497
deliberately, and Home sometimes then tucked up his feet on the
seat of the chair and held up his hands in view of all of us. On
such an occasion I have got down, and seen and felt that all four
legs were off the ground at the same time, Home's feet being on the
chair.
Unfortunately there seems, as far as 1 can discover, to be
no contemporary record of these occasions when the levitation
was stated to be not only plainly visible, but tested by the
sense of touch.
The Fire Test.
Coming to the " fire test," some cases of this, as displayed
by Home, have always appeared to me among the most
difficult of his performances to explain away, either by the
hypothesis of any mechanical trick or by that of illusion.
In regard to tricks : chemical methods for procuring immunity
from burning might have been used by Home for his own
hands, but hardly for those of his sitters. It is possible to
hold a kettle full of boiling water on one's hand for a moment,
the hand being protected by an intervening layer of steam
formed from its own moisture, but the protection would only
last for a very short time. Mr. Baggally tells me that if a
handkerchief be stretched tight over a small plate of cold
metal, such as the back of a watch, a red-hot coal may remain
on it for a few seconds without burning it. All these are
known methods, and it seems not impossible that Home may
on occasion have resorted to them.
I am inclined to think that suggestion may also have
been used occasionally. In that case we should have to
suppose that, by some sleight-of-hand, Home was able to
create the impression that he was taking a coal out of a
red-hot fire when he really took it, say, out of his pocket,
and we should have further to suppose that he made his
sitters believe it was red-hot when it was only, say, painted
red. This supposition would at least be not inconsistent with
the cinder dust left in the hair of Mr. Hall after the (sup-
posed) red-hot coal had been placed in it (Lord Adare's Experi-
ences, pp. 178-9). But, says Count Solovovo, in this as in
some other cases (see also pp. 146-7) these alleged hot
lamp chimneys or coals burn some people and not others.
498 Alice Johnson. [part
Occasionally it seems to me that this could be explained, not by
the hypothesis that Count Solovovo mentions only to dismiss,
—
viz. that some of the sitters were somehow rendered immune from
the heat,—but on the contrary, by supposing that the chimney
or coal was not really very hot, and that the effect of burning
and blistering was produced in the case of Captain Gerard
Smith's finger (Dialectical Society's Report, p. 361), by suggestion,
as in a number of cases referred to in Human Personality,
Vol. I. pp. 495-7.
This hypothesis, however, does not apply to cases where a
sitter is not burnt by a (supposed) red-hot coal which does
(apparently) burn some inanimate object, such as a piece of
paper (Lord Adare's Experiences, p. 179). Here we should
have to suppose further that Home had contrived by some
other means to set fire to the paper.
But when we come to the first case described in Lord
Adare's book (pp. 67-68), where Home not only takes coals-
out of the fire, but places " his face right among the burning
coals, moving it about as though bathing it in water," and
afterwards holds his finger for some time in a candle-flame
;
1
or to the two cases recorded by Sir William Crookes, when
he observed that Home stirred the hot coals of the fire about
with his hands (Proceedings S.P.E., Vol. VI. pp. 103-4), Sir
W. Crookes on one occasion standing close to the fire and
stooping down to it as Home put his hands in ; we can hardly
explain away these occurrences without assuming either a
wholesale incapacity for observation, or an abnormal condition
of consciousness.
Quasi-Hypnotic Effects.
But have we any other evidence, besides that afforded by
some of the fire-tests, of effects produced on Home's sitters-
analogous to the effects of hypnotic suggestion ? I think we
have. I quoted above the red mark that appeared on Lord
Adare's hand after Home had wept two or three tears on it ;.
for it can -hardly be supposed that these tears were actually
hot enough to produce a mark.
Again (see Lord Adare's Experiences, p. 68) Home says he-
will withdraw the moisture and scent from some flowers; then
1
Note, however, that after these performances Home remarked that he must
wash his hands.
LVI.] The Education of the Sitter. 499'
he rubbed Lord Adare's hands, " imparting the odour of the
flowers to them ... he also nipped the moisture and with
it the scent from his fingers to each person." Later (p. 76)r
Home having " magnetised " some water, Lord Adare is told
to take some of it night and morning as a cure. Then comes
a curious story of brandy being made weak (p. 78) by Home
making passes over the glass and flipping his fingers over it,
" sending a strong smell of spirit through the room ; in about
five minutes he had made the brandy as weak as very weak
brandy and water ; it scarcely tasted at all of spirit ; both
Lindsay and I tasted it at the moment, and also some time
after the seance was over."
Again {op. ext., p. 90)
:
Home then made some very curious experiments with flowers
;
he separated the scent into two portions—one odour smelling
exactly like earth, the other being very sweet. . . .
[Later in the sitting, Home went out of the room and then]
returned, holding in his hand half a lemon, freshly cut; he handed
it to each of us to taste. He laughed and said, " Yes, it is very
good, is it not
1
? So refreshing." He then held it up above his
head and said, "We will withdraw all the acid flavour from it."
A yellowish light came over the lemon ; he held it up for some
little time and said, "Now taste again." He held it out to me,
but the room being rather dark I bobbed my nose against it, and
therefore tasted nothing. All the others tasted it, and described it
as most disagreeable, having no odour, and the flavour being a sort
of mawkish alkali ; some describing it as like magnesia ; others as
like washing soda. Home laughed and said, "We will take the
nasty taste away presently." . . . [Later, having stated that the
acid would now be restored to the lemon], he held the lemon up
and a rose-coloured flame, or rather light, came over it. After a
little, he gave it to those who had tasted it the second time ;
they
said that it was quite good and fresh, and that all the natural scent
and flavour was restored to it.
These incidents irresistibly recall the ordinary platform
hypnotic experiments of making subjects eat, say, pieces of
soap or candle under the impression that they are pieces of
cake. It is of course well known that some simple delusions
of this kind can be imposed on many persons without hypnosis,
500 Alice Johnson. [part
and it certainly looks as if Home had the capacity for doing
this.
There are, further, indications too numerous to quote in full
of persons at his sittings partially or completely losing either
their consciousness, or their control over their muscles—which
may, one would suppose, involve some change in the con-
sciousness.
1
Thus, Mr. Holt at his first sitting becomes much
affected ; his hands are taken possession of and violently
agitated ; his arms are drawn back behind his chair (Lord
Adare's Experiences, p. 22). It is this agitated gentleman who
is specially called upon by Home to observe the details
of the process of " elongation " of the medium on this
occasion. At the same sitting one of the ladies present
becomes entranced. Lord Adare says (p. 28, foot-note) that
he has often " seen people's hands taken possession of and
agitated during seances," and " the same thing has occurred
to myself." At another seance (p. d-4) Count Eonicker
was present, " and his magnetic influence was so strong
that it made us all more or less ill." At a sitting ten days
after the window levitation episode, the Master of Lindsay fell
into a trance, and at first could not speak. After waking, he
saw spirit forms (p. 89). Mr. Lawless feels a sensation as if
a hot stream flowed into him when Home's hand is pressed
against the back of his neck, and later he and Miss Smith
become hysterical (p. 99). On March 2nd Mrs. Blackburn
becomes slightly under influence and a good deal agitated.
Home tells her this is caused by two spirits whom he can see
standing behind her and magnetising' her. Meanwhile Mr.
Lawless is again hysterical (p. 105). Two days later the same
thing happens to Mrs. Blackburn again, and Home tells her
she is coming under spirit influence (p. 109). On a third
1
Sensations of this kind are sometimes regarded as indications of a super-
normal power on the part of the medium in whose presence they occur. Mrs.
Sidgwick, in her paper on " Results of a Personal Investigation into the Physical
Phenomena of Spiritualism" (Proceedings S.P.E.., Vol. IV. p. 55), observed
during an undoubtedly fraudulent performance that " the gentleman who held
the medium's left hand, and who was not placed so as to be able to see what
was going on, was of a sensitive organisation, and felt during the performances
the sensations which he always experienced at successful spiritualistic seances,
—
shudderings and convulsive movements of the arms, I think they were—which
shows that sensations of this kind afford no evidence of the genuineness of the
manifestations."
The Education of the Sitter. 501
repetition of the same, he makes passes over her, suggesting
that her mediumistic powers will be developed (p. 117).
These passes seem to have been used with effect on other
occasions, and notably if made by Home when in a trance
condition. Thus (p. 86) "Home was taken possession of, his
hands and arms became partially cataleptic, and he made passes
in this condition over Augusta [Gore] for some time, then
stooping down he made passes under the couch [on which
she was lying], which Augusta said she felt distinctly." At
the same seance—it is not clear whether before or after the
passes—she sees " spirit-forms," apparently seen by no one
else.
Again (pp. 133-4) Home, under influence, makes "mesmeric
passes " over all the sitters, and repeats them after an interval.
This was at one of the sittings referred to by Count Solovovo,
when " spirit hands " were (after the passes) seen by the
sitters.
A much more striking scene occurred at a later seance
(pp. 153-5), when Mr. J. and Lord Adare were the only
sitters. After Home had gone through a realistic series of
dramatisations, which were interpreted as representing scenes
in the life of Mr. J.'s brother, Mr. J. fell into a deep trance,
sobbed violently, spoke in Arabic with great rapidity, and
called his brother's name, evidently referring to the scenes just
enacted by Home, who had finally to wake him up from the
trance.
Again (p. 163), the sitters remaining behind after a seance
with Home, the Master of Lindsay was first mesmerised by Mr.
Bergheim, and on waking mesmerised Mr. Bergheim in his turn.
Mr. Bergheim became very uncomfortable, and said he was
being " cross-mesmerised." On waking he said that the last
thins; he recollected before becoming entranced was seeino- a
figure or form of some sort standing beside the Master of
Lindsay. The experiment was repeated, and he again imagined
himself under the influence of some spirit ; then he said the
spirit had gone away, and that the Master of Lindsay could
not wake him without its help, and implored him to bring it
back. They opened the door and told him it had come back,
which seemed to satisfy him ;
then he soon awoke, but was
in a nervous state for some time.
2i
502 Alice Johnson. [part
All these incidents seem to me to point to a very suggestible
condition on the part of the sitters.
In connection with this subject I may briefly refer to an
experience of my own at my second sitting with Eusapia
Paladino. The sitting, like many of those with Home, was
held in almost complete darkness, and I was supposed to be
controlling Eusapia's left arm and hand, while Mr. Myers was
controlling her on the right. At that time I had had little
practical experience in the kind of holding that is required
under such circumstances, and I apparently let the hand and
arm on my side get free. Various phenomena followed, all
easily within the capacity of this hand, if free,—such as touches
on my head, back, etc. Quite apart from these phenomena,
I went through a series of curious hallucinations of an almost
indescribable kind,—indescribable because they were so unlike
any ordinary sensations. There was no break in consciousness,
but the condition was, T have no doubt, a slightly abnormal
one, and one in which I could not depend on my own powers
of observation as to the actual events of the sitting.
It was my recollection of this occasion that made me inclined
to think that Mr. Warndorfer might have been in a somewhat
similar condition when he witnessed the " levitation " described
above in Count Solovovo's paper, p. 457.
Occasional In efficacy of the Suggestions.
Further evidence of Home's practice of suggestion is to be
found in many instances given in Lord Adare's report where
the suggestion failed to take effect. Failures of this kind
have, as has often been remarked, no tendency to discredit a
medium. If a professed conjurer fails, it is put down to want
of skill on his part. If a medium fails, he can generally
charge it on the want of spiritual capacity of the sitter.
The case of Adah Menken (Lord Adare's Experiences, pp. 34-7)
has already been referred to by Count Solovovo in this con-
nection. Here Home could, it seems, only partially produce
the effect at which he was aiming.
On another occasion (pp. 56-59), just after the death of
Dannie Cox, Home took Lord Adare in the middle of the
night, and in complete darkness, into the drawing-room in which
Lvr.] The Education of the Sitter. 503
the child's coffin was placed, and told him to raise the lid of
the coffin, when he heard a slight rustling inside, and then
took him back into his bedroom and said to him :
"Little Dannie is there between you and the light; can you
not see him'?" "No," I said, "I cannot." He laughed and said,
"Dannie would make himself appear as white; but he cannot just
yet; he has so recently come to us. He will try and make himself
visible as a dark shadow to you." I still said that I could see
nothing. " Ah, never mind !
" Home said ; and holding one of my
hands in his, he stretched it out in the dark and said, " Dannie
will let you play with it first." I perceive a strong scent, as it
were, blown over me and felt a flower touch my fingers and then
withdraw itself. Presently I felt a little soft hand touch mine, and
a flower was given me. I then felt a strong tremor run through
Home's hands, and he spoke as little Dannie and said, " You must
get into bed cpuickly ; Dan is going to awake ; if you would like
very much to see what you have got, you can make an excuse to
light a candle presently." Accordingly, after Home had awoke, I
lit a candle, and found I had been given a purple- and white
petunia that had been placed in one of the little hands in the
coffin.
The account shows, it may be noted, that Home would
have had no difficulty in abstracting the flower in question
from the coffin.
After a few more seances, in one of which Dannie was
supposed to manifest, the suggestion was repeated with greater
effect (see p. 65), again in Lord Adare's bedroom, which he
shared with Home and which seems to have been the scene
of much of his training as a sitter. First, Home entranced
and in bed, speaks as little Dannie and tells Lord Adare to
come and sit on his bed, which he does, remarking that he
wished to see manifestations. Then
:
We heard a spirit come in and walk about the room ; and per-
ceived a light near the ceiling. Little Dannie Cox then came and
moved away a pillow that Home had over his feet. He stroked
and pulled my feet and sat on them. . . . We also saw the same
sort of little star we had seen at Stockton. He then said, "Now
good-night " and stood upon the foot of the bed. I saw him distinctly
as a shadowy figure, of the same size as his mortal body, with
504 Alice Johnson. [part
apparently some loose drapery on. His hand was stretched out
towards us waving about. The hand and arm were directly between
me and the window and interrupted the light as palpably as if
made of solid flesh and bone.
Again (p. 63), Home tells Lord Adare that "A has just
come in ; he has come bustling into the room ;
you heard
him." Lord Adare replies, " Well, I heard a noise as if the
door had been opened." " Yes," says Home, " that was him ;
you will always know when A. comes ; he will make a
sound like that at the door." Here we see the partial failure
skilfully covered up. Similarly (p. 64) Home says: "You
were magnetised just now, and you heard a spirit shout." Lord
Adare replies, " I am not aware that I did." Home rejoins,
" You did not notice it ;
you did not know what it was and
you did not pay any attention to it ; but you heard it."
On a later occasion (p. 72) Home gives a graphic account
of a vision he professes to see at night of a race-course and
men betting and then fighting, but only succeeds in getting
Lord Adare to hear a sound as of a horse galloping and a
noise in the corner of the room like a blow struck.
I have already referred to the promised levitation which
failed to take place (p. 79), but preluded the successful attempt
at 5 Buckingham Gate on Dec. 16th, 1868.
Again, he tries to persuade Lord Adare that the latter has
had a certain dream (p. 85), after ascertaining that he could
not remember what he had dreamt the night before.
Similarly (p. 148), while sitting up together in the evening
in Home's room, they hear raps on the door, and Home says,
" Your grandfather has come in ; do you not see him sitting
in that chair yonder ?
" "I see no one," I answered, " which
grandfather do you mean ?
" " Your father's father ;
you will
at any rate hear him." Accordingly Lord Adare hears a sound
as if some one sitting on the chair had put his foot on the
ground, and then sees the chair move from a distance up to
the table, apparently untouched.
Alternation of Suggestion and other Methods.
The incident just cpuoted is a possible instance of the alter-
nation of suggestion and other methods. Home may easily
LVI.] The Education of the Sitter. 505
have had some arrangement for moving the chair. But the
incident would have been more impressive if the grandfather
had been seen moving it, so he tries to make Lord Adare
see his grandfather, but only succeeds in making him hear a
vague sound. As a rule, he can only produce definite visual
hallucinations in complete or partial darkness.
Suggestion is of course a safer method to use than a
mechanical contrivance which may be discovered, but why
should not a medium adapt himself to circumstances, and use
one or the other or both ? Thus the visions seen by Lord
Adare in his bedroom at night were probably all hallucinatory.
But the materialisation of Adah Menken, described by Lord
Adare (p. 145), seems to me of a familiar objective type.
[The room having been darkened] Home went into a trance. . . .
We all saw a very curious appearance form itself above his head ;
it looked at first like a lace handkerchief, held out by a stick or
support of some sort ;
soon, however, it became more distinct, and
appeared to be a shadowy human form enveloped in drapery ; it was
about two feet in length. Some one present remarked that it
exceedingly resembled a " vignette " heading one of Adah Menken's
poems. Home said (speaking as Menken), "Yes, that is it, that is
what I wish to imitate ; I will try and make my form visible to
you." The surface of the wall to Home's right became illuminated
three or four times ; the light apparently radiating from a bright
spot in the centre. Across the portion of wall thus illuminated we
repeatedly saw a dark shadow pass; it appeared to me rather the
shadow cast by a solid substance than the actual form itself. Home's
collar stud dropped on the floor, and a spirit [Home ?] brought it
and placed it on my head, touching my brow while doing so.
The full account (see pp. 95 and 177) of the apparition
of Sacha, referred to by Count Solovovo, again suggests strongly
a " materialisation " manipulated by Home, on whom, it is to
be remembered, no restrictions whatever were placed in any
of these sittings.
Becognition.
These cases lead us on to consider what kind or degree of
illusion is involved in the " recognition " of materialised forms
or spirit photographs, and how far such an illusion is induced
506 Alice Johnson. [part
by the medium, or whether it originates spontaneously in the
sitters. In the case of Adah Menken just quoted the medium
seemed to have profited by a casual remark of one of the
sitters to suggest the identification ; while in the second case
he himself told them that the form was Sacha. In neither
case, however, does it appear that any distinct resemblance to
the supposed original was perceived by any of the sitters,
and in this respect the cases are similar to many materialisa-
tions produced by professional mediums, where it is simply
assumed that certain forms represent the first person thought
of by the sitter with whom they are supposed to be
connected.
Yet no one who has attended such sittings and carefully
watched the proceedings can, I think, doubt that occasionally
some sitter really sees a very close resemblance in one of
the faces to some intimate friend of his. In cases where the
identity of the medium with the form is detected, as in the
case recorded by Mr. More (quoted above by Count Solovovo,
with which may usefully be compared the, case of Mr. W. B.
Hodgson, see above, p. 474, footnote); or in the case of
collective vision in a mirror (quoted above by Count Solovovo,
p. 463), this phenomenon is called by believers "transfiguration."
In other cases it is called " materialisation."
That there is at least a very frequent element of illusion
in these cases is proved by the fact that different sitters
vary widely in their impressions of them. I quote the
following instance from notes of my own.
June 20th, 1905.
Mr. A. E. H., a member of the American Branch, who called here
this morning, gave me a long account of his experiences in seeing
materialised forms. It appeared that he had been investigating the
subject for some 20 years, and had concluded that most mediums
were fraudulent. But there were two or three whom he had ex-
perimented with a long time and believed to be genuine, or at least
that some of their phenomena were so.
He told me this incident among others : On one occasion he had
very clearly recognised the face of a friend of his, seen in a
perfectly life-like manner, the colour and form of the face exactly
like life and exactly like the person. A friend of his, looking
at the same face, saw only a vague luminous clouddike thing
LVI.] The Education of the Sitter. 507
with no features. On the same occasion, this friend saw quite
dearly and recognised the face of some friend of his in what
appeared to Mr. H. a vague, luminous, cloud-like thing with no
features.
Here one or other of the percipients must have been under an
illusion. Similarly when Professor Furness (as quoted by Count
Solovovo) saw the medium in the forms recognised by other sitters
as their friends, either he or the other sitters must have been
under an illusion. For the purposes of my argument, it makes
no difference whether it is the believer or the sceptic that was
deluded ;
I merely maintain that illusion there was, and that of
a pronounced kind.
Probably most people are not aware of the differences in faces
that are produced by different accessories, or, in particular, by
differences of illumination, and therefore do not know how easily
mistakes in recognition may be made. Some years ago, after
witnessing the " materialisations " of Husk and Craddock, and
hearing from a number of people how much they had been
impressed by seeing forms which they recognised, I tried experi-
ments on this point, as follows
:
On May 17th, 1905, seven persons, (five of whom were members
of the S.P.R.) came to the Pooms at 20 Hanover Square at my
invitation to witness experiments in sham materialisations, my object
being to test how far they would recognise or fail to recognise the
faces of persons slightly disguised, but well known to them.
The room was arranged as is usual for sittings for materialisations,
that is, it was darkened as completely as possible, with a cabinet
in one corner, near to which the sitters were arranged in a semi-circle.
The performers entered the cabinet from a door opening into the back
of it.
There were three performers who played the part of materialised
forms, viz. myself and one of the Assistant Secretaries, both, of us
being well known to most of the sitters, and a third lady who was
only known to one or two of them.
This lady took the first part and dressed herself in drapery with
a head-dress supposed to be Persian. She came out into the room,
holding a luminous slate up to her face, and spoke in a low voice
one or two Hindu phrases which she happened to know.
The Assistant Secretary with the help of a very obviously false
moustache and turban posed as a Hindu. The sitters, who were
508 Alice Johnson. [part
asked to note their impressions, described her variously as a young
Indian, an Egyptian, or of the Hindu type.
I appeared as a nun, with drapery over the head. I was interested
to find that this simple disguise led the sitters to estimate my age
variously as from 18 to 25 ; for I had lately been told by a man
who had been attending Husk's materialising seances that one of the
forms that came to him was a young man of about 18 or 20, and
the medium being about 50, it would have been impossible, he said,
for him to personate such a young man. Husk was accustomed to
use a luminous slate such as we were using to show the faces of
the "spirit" forms.
At this experimental sitting, not one of the performers was
recognised at any time by any of the sitters, and this in spite of
the fact that they knew the performance to be a sham and therefore
were not open to any emotional influences that might have interfered
with their powers of observation. They knew too that my assistants
and I were likely to be among the performers; yet the only one
whom they thought they recognised was the assistant who happened
not to be there.
Possibility of Negative Hallucinations.
Count Solovovo remarks that if we admit that positive
hallucinations may occur at seances, " we are logically bound
to infer that [the medium] may also prevent [his sitters'] seeing
some actions of his, or even his own person,—may, in fact,
induce in them not only positive, but also negative hallucina-
tions." I think this actually does occur not infrequently, and
I quote an instance of it from Mr. Podmore's Modem Spiritualism,
Vol. II., p. 217, in connection with a slate-writing seance given
to his brother, Mr. Austin Podmore, by Mr. S. J. Davey,
Mr. A. Podmore held in his left hand a slate the other end
of wMch was held by Mr. Davey. He then unlocked a double
slate given to him by Mr. Davey, put three pieces of chalk,
red, green and grey, inside, locked it up again and placed the
key in his pocket and the. slate on the table where he could
watch it. His account continues :
After some few minutes, during which, to the best of my belief.
I was attentively regarding both slates, Mr. D. whisked the first
away and showed me on the reverse a message written to myselL
lvi.] The Education of the Sitter. 50&
Almost immediately afterwards he asked me to unlock the second
slate, and on doing so I found to my intense astonishment another
message written on both the insides of the slate— the lines in alternate
colours and the chalks apparently much worn by usage.
My brother tells me that there was an interval of some two or
three minutes, during which my attention was called away, but I
can onby believe it on his word.
Austin Podmore.
Mr. Frank Podmore adds :
Mr. Davey allowed me to see exactly what was done, and this is
what I saw. The "almost immediately" in the above account
covered an interval of some minutes. During the interval, and
indeed throughout the seance, Davey kept up a constant stream of
chatter. . . . Mr. A. Podmore, absorbed by the conjurer's patter,
fixed his eyes on Davey's face, and the latter took advantage of
the opportunity to remove the locked slate under cover of a duster
from under my brother's nose to the far end of the room, and
there exchange it for a similar slate, with a previously prepared
message, which was then placed by means of the same manoeuvre
with the duster in the position originally occupied by the first slate.
Then and only then the stream of talk slackened and Mr. A.
Podmore's attention became concentrated upon the slate, from
which the sound of spirit writing was now heard to proceed. To
me the most surprising thing in the whole episode was Mr. A.
Podmore's incredulity when told that his attention had been
diverted from the slate for an appreciable period.
Here then it seems that Mr. Davey had got up from his
place and walked over to the other end of the room and
back again without the sitter being aware that he had done
so, and this in full light, with a sitter whose whole attention
(as he himself believed) was being directed to his movements.
Count Solovovo maintains that we are not entitled to
suppose that misinterpretation can assume such gigantic pro-
portions as to make several people mistake a man who thrust
his head and shoulders out of the window for one who was
floating in the air outside the window. My reply would be
that a very small error in perception may sometimes lead to
a very large error of inference. I have suggested that when
Home was believed to be standing outside, he was perhaps
really standing inside.' If so, this, as far as the perception
510 Alice Johnson. [part
of the witnesses was concerned, would have involved but a
slight illusion in regard to the relative positions of Home and
the window, and one which I find is easily induced, at least
in myself. But it would involve a very large error of inference
to suppose that Home had come to the window from the
outside if he had really come from the inside.
During the sittings with Eusapia Paladino at Cambridge in
1895, I experienced an illusion of position of a kind which
is known to be frequent in darkness, which I described at the
time as follows :
With regard to the [supposed head of John King] I noticed a
curious illusion which I cannot explain, viz. that while something
in tlie appearance suggested to me that the "head" was on a
level with the further end of the table —which Eusapia's head
could hardly have reached unless she stood up and leant far for-
ward —something else gave me the impression that the "head" was
only at the point that she could easily have reached without stand-
ing. She was actually sitting at the time, and I have no doubt
that the latter impression was the correct one. But if this second
element in the perception had been missing, I should have thought
I had seen a head in a position where it was almost impossible
for Eusapia's head to be. 1
[Subsequent observation showed that this
head was practically in the position of Eusapia's head and undoubtedly
identical with it.]
I will quote one more instance of spontaneous illusion or
hallucination as to the real position of an object, sent to me
by Mr. F. C. Constable, of Wick Court, near Bristol, who
writes
:
I have frequently to walk from my house to the village club. The
road outside the house runs, for perhaps twenty yards, with trees
on one side and an iron fencing on the other. Then comes a five-
barred gate which I have to open to pass through into an open
field. The road is naturally very familiar to me.
At nightfall when, on leaving the light of the house, I can at first
see nothing and, later on, only the path very dimly, and objects
dimly definite but at a yard or two, the following false visualization
is of almost common occurrence. I see the bars of the gate before
me, crossing my path, before I come to the material gate. For
1
Journal S.P.R., Vol. VII. p. 15S.
LVI.] The Education of the Sitter. 511
instance : last night it was so dark I walked from the path on to
the grass. As I felt my way back to the path and raised my eyes
there were the bars of the gate before me. I put out my hand,
felt nothing and walked on some steps before I reached the gate
itself. This false visualization has occurred, very possibly, twenty
or thirty times during the last three years, and, carefully dissecting
my experience, I am of opinion the false visualization is, to me,
as real and definite as visualization resulting from the material.
I should perhaps state that this false visualization is unique in
my experience.
[Later Mr. Constable adds :] Last night walking to the club I
determined to "bilk" the hallucination. As I walked I marked a
tree on my right and said to myself " now the gate is within three
feet of me." I looked. There was the gate. I walked to it. It
was not there, but some six or seven feet distant. I looked again
at the tree (remember it was but a dim shadow in the darkness)
and saw I had mistaken it for another.
A clear case of a visual hallucination raised by a false association
of ideas.
F. C. Constable.
It appears to me that simple and slight errors of this kind,
whether occurring spontaneously or suggested by the medium,
may account for a good many supposed telekinetic phenomena
;
since through such errors, which would, of course, be chiefly
liable to occur in a bad light, the medium might appear to be
at a little distance from objects with which he was really in
contact.

NOTE ON MISS JOHNSON'S PAPEE.
By Count Peeovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.
I have read Miss Johnson's paper on " The Education of the
Sitter " with the greatest possible interest and sympathy.
Her arguments have struck me as being presented in a
very forcible way ; and I willingly admit that there is in
them a good deal of apparently good evidence tending to
indicate suggestion on Home's part as a plausible explanation
of some at least of his marvels.
But we have still to give full weight to the following
circumstances : (a) that whilst some of Home's phenomena
have been proved objective beyond a doubt, none have ever
been undoubtedly shown to be hallucinatory; (5) that, apart
from Home, there exists an overwhelming mass of evidence
showing the most startling " phenomena " of Spiritualism to
be objective, to whatever cause due.
For with regard to the last point, it must not be lost sight
of that the distinction drawn between the " manifestations
"
of Home and those of other mediums is purely arbitrary.
If Home's manifestations were authentic, those of some other
mediums must have been equally genuine : if all other physical
phenomena are spurious, then Home's must have been fraudu-
lent also.
It should also be borne in mind, I think, that here, as
in every-day experience, the most plausible explanation may
after all not be the true one. Misdescription, illusion pure
and simple, and illusion combined with fraud may work very
well as explanations in ninety-nine cases ;
but when we come
to the hundredth there may turn out a circumstance which
will clearly show such a hypothesis to be inadequate ; and if
in one case, why not in others ?
lvi.] Note on Miss Johnson's Paper. 513
From this point of view, let us consider a characteristic
instance. Mr. T. Adolphus Trollope narrates how at one of
Home's sittings in Florence
a middle-aged Italian gentleman of the Jewish persuasion asked
that the spirit of his father, who, it was stated by the medium,
was present, should mention where he and his son, then communi-
cating with him, last met on earth. It should be stated that the
inquirer, having abandoned the faith of his fathers, professed entire
disbelief in any existence of the soul or any future life. The answer
to his query was spelled out in the manner I have already described
[i.e. through raps] a certain Italian city being named. I watched
the face of the sceptical inquirer as the letters were " rapped out
"
and gradually completed the name required. And I needed no
confession of the fact from him to know that the answer had been
correctly given. I thought the man would have fallen from his
chair. He became ghastly pale and trembled all over. . . -
1
Here the explanation almost lies on the surface, and
there cannot be any doubt that it could tit many cases.
But suppose it is undoubtedly disproved in but one clear
instance, what then ? Are we to maintain that the experience
of the "Italian gentleman of the Jewish persuasion" is still
to be put down to Home watching the expression of his face
at the appropriate letter when we read that at another seance
at Mr. Trollope's house,
there was present a well-known and much respected English banker
established in Florence, a hale, robust, cheery sort of man. . . .
A " spirit " was announced as having come for him. Who is it 1
A name was rapped out in the manner described. The elderly
banker declared that he never had any friend or relative of that
name, and had never heard it before. A second time the name was
spelled out, while the banker sat thrashing out his recollections.
Suddenly he struck his forehead with his hand and exclaimed :
u By Heaven, it is true ! Nancy ! (I forget the name). She
was my nurse in Yorkshire more than half a century ago !
" . . .
Taking into consideration the total severance of the old banker's
infancy both as to years and locality from any of his then surround-
ings, the fact that it was so long since he had heard the name in
1
What I Remember, by T. Adolphus Trollope, Vol. I. pp. 391-392. I am
indebted to Miss Johnson for this reference.
514 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [pakt
question mentioned that he had himself entirely forgotten it, and
the further fact that there was nobody at Florence who had any
connection with him or his family in his early years, and the cir-
cumstance that he that evening saw Mr. Hume for the first time
—
I confess that it seems to me that the improbability of any proposed
explanation of the mystery must be incalculably great indeed for
a solution, the improbability of which approaches so very near to
impossibility, to be preferably accepted. 1
From which it follows that the theory which presented
itself almost irresistibly to the reader's mind as an explanation
of the first incident' proves in the present instance utterly
insufficient ; and should consecpuently hardly be pressed too
much as a general solution of a certain category of the Home
mysteries.
So it may be with regard to many of the incidents
adduced by Miss Johnson in her paper. Taken separately^
they seem to point to " suggestions " as not only the most
natural, but the almost inevitable explanation. But it does
not follow that this is necessarily the true one.
At the same time it goes without saying that if we postu-
late : (a) the general untrustworthiness of the accounts of
Home's stances ; (&) the probability of his having been able at
times to impress hallucinations or illusions on some of his
sitters ; and (c) especially the possibility of such impressed
illusions being sometimes (as suggested by Miss Johnson)
coupled with fraud, we shall have dealt the Home evidence a
most damaging blow.
Point (a) is perhaps the most worthy of note and the
most discouraging. And it is especially to be regretted that
there are unsatisfactory features even in our best Home
evidence,—that coming from scientists of world-wide fame.
For, with all due respect to them, it seems to me distinctly
unsatisfactory that the most startling incidents should be
sometimes described in a few lines of print only ; that in
other cases recollections more than twenty years old, and
apparently not based on any contemporary notes, should be
deemed sufficient ; and that we should be told again and
again that such and such phenomena occurred under specially
pre-arranged conditions, without, at least in most cases, being
1
National Jieview, May 1890, pp. 306-307.
Note on Miss Johnson's Paper. 515
shown what these conditions were. And if such drawbacks
occur in our best testimony, what wonder if witnesses of
much inferior scientific standing do not conform to the
required standard.
Again, Miss Johnson thinks it " very significant " that
there should be so wide a difference between Mr. Burr's first
account of his experience with a materialised hand published
in 1863 and that given in Mme. Home's work 32 years
after the event. I also think such a discrepancy unfor-
tunate from the positive side ; but I do not see in this a
decisive proof that Mr. Burr was labouring, in 1887, under
a hallucination of memory. It is perhaps possible, though,
I admit, not very probable, that if Mr. Burr abstained in
1863 from recounting the whole of his experience, it was
simply because the public at large were less prepared then
for such a thins; as a materialised hand with a human fore-
finger pushed right through it, than they could be supposed
to be a quarter of a century later, after the public stage
had long been occupied by Slade, Eglinton and other marvel-
mongers, and after so many persons of scientific eminence had
" endorsed " the most stupendous mecliumistic miracles.
To my mind the main thing is not why Mr. Burr omitted
to mention in 1863 a fact on which he dwelt at length in
1887, but what kind of witness he was. If he resembled
in this respect some Spiritualists with whom I have the
pleasure of being personally acquainted,—well, I can only say
I should reject his testimony unhesitatingly if brought forward
even thirty- two days, not years, after the event.
But to return to illusion versus the " Physical Phenomena."
Quite lately, at the S.P.B. meeting of June 29th, 1908, we
had the old story of the photographing of the Indian fakirs
brought to the front again, and this time by an undoubted
eye-witness {Journal S.P.R., Vol. XIII. p. 273, July, 1908).
Here, I think, is the crux of the whole matter. Let Dr.
Mehrji properly authenticate his story, and the old controversy
will be brought very near a definite settlement. Till this is
done, all this theorising, whether for or against the objectivity
of the " Physical Phenomena," appears to me little more
than beating the air. What we want is new facts, and I
earnestly trust we shall get them.

SUPPLEMENT.
REVIEWS.
Psicologia e " Spiritismo" : Impressioni e note critiche sui fenomeni
medianici di Eusapia Paladino, by E. Morselli. (2 vols. Fratelli
Bocca, Turin, 1908.)
The fame of Professor Morselli as a nerve-specialist and psychologist
is world-wide, and his pronouncements on the mediumistic pheno-
mena of Eusapia Paladino cannot therefore but excite considerable
interest. The book before us, in two thick volumes, consists of
three parts, besides a valuable bibliography of the literature of
modern spiritualism and Psychical Eesearch, and Professor Morselli
approaches the subject with a wide, if not in every case deep, 1
acquaintance with this literature. Part I. treats of modern spiritual-
ism and mediumship generally, and gives a brief history of Eusapia
Paladino. Part II., which occupies the greater part of the book,
consists of descriptions (written on the night of the sitting or as
soon after as possible) of the twenty-eight sittings the author has
had with her. Twenty of these sittings took place in 1901 and
1902, and six in the winter of 1906-7. It is these last six which
have excited most interest among psychical researchers in this
country, doubtless because much publicity was given to them
through the Italian daily press ; but it is interesting to note that
Professor Morselli himself considers them inferior to the earlier
ones, and that he is of opinion that Eusapia's mediumship has
deteriorated. 2
A great deal of general discussion, psychological,
biological, theoretical and critical, accompanies the narrative, and
1
1 have noticed some misunderstandings and misrepresentations of passages
from works with which I am acquainted, but possibly this may only be due
to quoting from memory or from inadequate notes.

appear as striking as those of Sir Oliver Lodge on the lie Roubaud.
LVI.] Review. 517
the author is specially interested in demonstrating that the spiritual-
istic hypothesis is unreasonable, superfluous and absurd. 1
The third part of the book, which is quite short, is a sort of
summary of Eusapia Paladino's " mediumistic " phenomena and the
various hypotheses held concerning them. Professor Morselli's own
conclusion is that the great majority of the phenomena that occur
at her seances are genuine manifestations of some kind of super-
normal activity to be explained by hitherto unknown psychical
forces connected with the human organism. A few of those
described may, he thinks, be due to illusion, and a small propor-
tion—say 10 per cent, or less—are due to fraud (Vol. L, p. 312).
For none is a spiritualistic explanation required, and "John King,"
Eusapia's "spirit guide," is not a real entity.
To the views expressed in this last sentence we may safely assent.
It is difficult at least to conceive how any serious student can
suppose that the hypothesis of the agency of " spirits " would render
Eusapia's phenomena more intelligible. But we need not dwell on
this, for the previous question—whether there are any supernormal
phenomena to explain—occupies the field, and the more important
point is not to prove the absence of spiritual agency, but to prove
the absence of tricks. To the present Avriter it does not seem that
in Professor Morselli's work quite enough attention is given to
showing that trickery was adequately guarded against, or that a
sufficient margin is allowed, beyond what within known laws of
nature is apparently possible, to justify the assumption that these
laws have been transcended.
As Professor Morselli says, there is a great sameness about the
general scheme of Eusapia's seances. After reading his book, I again
read through the notes of the Cambridge sittings of 13 years ago,
x
Ia proving this he sometimes uses rather double-edged arguments. Thus
lie takes pains to point out that the position and nature of, eg. the touches
are generally such as they would be if sometimes Eusapia's hands and some-
times her feet were used to produce them. For example, only the sitters
next to her are touched on the side, as it were with her feet. More distant
sitters are touched, if at all, on the back of the hands (on the table) or on
the face (cf. Vol. I., p. 276), as it were with her hand. It is as if, Professor
Morselli says, Eusapia had the idea of touching thus—as if she represents it
thus to herself. He draws the inference that we are not dealing with any
psychological entity other than hers, but that her powers are increased,
exteriorised, by means of some unknown biological law. It is obvious that
the facts mentioned may equally point to trickery, if we can suppose a hand
or foot free.

and was struck afresh with this. With us, as with him, the
sittings usually began with movements and levitations of the table,
often in a goodish light. The phenomena that followed—touches,
grasps, movement of objects, appearances as of hands or other
extensions of Eusapia's limbs, and occasionally lights, depended
evidentially almost entirely on adequate holding of her hands and
feet in a poor light, or almost complete darkness. I may remark
in passing that our conditions of holding seem to have been, on
the whole, better than those in use at Professor Morselli's sittings,
for whenever Eusapia would allow it, we held her feet with our
hands instead of trusting to contact between the sitters' feet and
hers. There is one respect in which the plan of the sittings seems
to have developed since 1895, namely, in the importance of the
part played by the curtained recess. At Cambridge no dark cur-
tained recess was specially provided. There were window curtains
in Mr. Myers's drawing-room where we sat, and also curtains
between two parts of the room. Both these sets of curtains were
used at different sittings —the table being placed near them at first,
or moved there after the sitting had began. By supposed super-
natural force the cm'tains were from time to time thrown forward
over the sitters or between Eusapia and those next to her. 1
But
they played a less important part than at Professor Morselli's
sittings, and there were no thin black curtains hung between the
ordinary heavy curtains to serve as a veil between the sitter and
the hands that touched him. Nor were the objects for use at the
seance placed behind the curtains at Cambridge.
In another respect, Professor Morselli's experiences differed from
and went beyond ours. He had, and we had not, a sitting for
" Materialisations." This—it was his twenty-second, and took place
in March, 1902—he regarded as the high-water mark of Eusapia
Paladino's manifestations. She was tied to a camp bedstead on
which she lay behind the curtains, and half-length figures with
head enveloped as with a scarf (or once as with a frilled cap),
appeared at the openings in a poor light. Readers will probably
differ as to whether this adds to the Aveight of evidence for the
genuineness of Eusapia or the reverse. So far as I can judge of
the conditions from Professor Morselli's description of them, I do
not think we should have regarded them as convincing in the case
1
One of the few unexplained phenomena which occurred at Cambridge was
connected with a curtain just behind the medium, which on one occasion,
in a good light, bulged out several times as though there were wind behind it.
LVI.] Review. 519
of the "materialisations" I have personally witnessed with other
mediums. These other mediums, however, failed to satisfy us, and
sooner or later were caught personating the materialised spirit by
investigators less scrupulous about seizing the " spirit " than our-
selves.
Materialisations of this sort, showing faces and forms, are recorded
comparatively rarely with Eusapia, but they may be said to be led
up to by the phenomena that are of constant occurrence. For the
touches felt at almost every seance are supposed to be made by
materialised hands, and sometimes these hands are seen. Some-
times, too, a roundish object suggesting a head appears silhouetted
against some faintly-illuminated background, or some faintly-illumi-
nated limb or other object appears against the darker background.
At some of Professor Morselli's sittings what were taken for parts
of a human form were felt pressing against the curtains from
behind. There was no question of an accomplice, and on some
occasions sitters were allowed to look behind the curtains and saw
nothing. It is not clear, however, whether such looking was always
simultaneous with the touches, and even if it was, supposing these
to be done by Eusapia's hand or arm (as the description sometimes
suggests to the reader), a person giving a rapid glance in a very
poor light and expecting to see a whole figure might easily be
deceived. These materialised limbs, whether seen or only felt, seldom
even appear to operate beyond the reach of the medium's own
natural hands or feet or head,1
and the reason for taking them to
be anything else is simply that her limbs are supposed to be held
or watched by the sitters.
I may illustrate this by some experiences at Cambridge. At the
first sitting of the Cambridge series, after various phenomena had
occurred, I (and others) saw a hand between me and the window.
At first I thought it was Eusapia's hand, but Mr. Myers said he
was holding her hand on her lap at the time. Later in the sitting
Eusapia said that John King was coming out from the curtain
1
Professor Morselli thinks that sometimes hands operated and objects were
moved beyond Eusapia's reach, and this was also occasionally thought by some
observers at the Cambridge sittings. But there is at the sittings so much
moving of the position of the whole circle, including the medium, so much
restlessness altogether, and so much difficulty in ascertaining what were the
exact relative positions before the phenomena, that it is difficult to get clear
evidence on this point. Moreover, careful experiments would be required to
determine the limits of possible reaching, which are wider than is often
supposed.

behind her. Presently several of the sitters saw a white object
with a rounded point to it moving behind Mr. Myers, who sat at
Eusapia's right hand, and against whose shoulder her head was
resting. Mr. X., who was next but one to her on the same side,
was new to the phenomena, and apparently did not realise that
" grabbing " without leave was against rules. H e put out his hand
and touched the object, which thereupon drew back. He said it felt
like a hand, or at all events something more solid than the cur-
tain (which had been moving about previously). Afterwards, "John
King" said he had used the medium's handkerchief to produce this
phenomenon, and asked where the handkerchief was, thinking appa-
rently that Mr. X. had taken it. After the sitting, Eusapia's
handkerchief was found lying behind the curtain. It is obvious
in this case that, if Eusapia had got her right hand free, she was
in a convenient position to use it to produce this phenomenon.
Again, at a certain point of the second sitting of the series,
Eusapia was standing up, Mr. Myers had her left hand, and Mrs. (after-
wards Lady) Stanley her right hand. I was in charge of her feet,
and was consequently lying on the floor holding them. As I looked
up from that position, the ceiling made a light background, against
which I saw silhouetted what looked exactly like Eusapia's right
arm and hand lifting a chair and placing it on the table. After
the chair was on the table, I similarly saw against the ceiling
Eusapia's arm and Lady Stanley's apparently holding each other by
the hand. I did not see any transition. Lady Stanley reported
that on this occasion Eusapia had drawn her (Lady S.'s) hand to
her (E.'s) body, and the pressure on her hand became that of two
fingers. The chair was lifted on to the table, and then the fingers
left Lady Stanley's hand, and Eusapia's cool hand returned and
closed over it.
It may be asked why, after experiences like these, we did not
give up the sittings, convinced that we had to do with a trickster,
especially with the warning of Signor Torelli Viollier, repeated by Pro-
fessor Richet, in our minds. No doubt the events above described were
suspicious ; but we had behind us the seances at the ile Eoubaud
which had so greatly impressed Sir Oliver Lodge and Mr. Myers
;
phenomena, like the best of those on the island, might be coming.
Besides, we had so far no proof of trickery. Lady Stanley felt and
described very accurately the way the hand resting on hers nar-
rowed till it became like two fingers 1
; but they were fingers, of that
l

LVI.] Review. 521
she was sure, and where did the fingers come from if the other
hand was well held? We had not yet traced the drawing of the two
hands together and the substitution of part of one for the other.
So we went on, sometimes depressed but sometimes cheered up
again, through twelve sittings. Others besides Lady Stanley noticed
the narrowing of the hand, and sometimes the brief gap in the
contact which she had so carefully described, but still no one
observed the actual substitution of one hand for the other. We
thought the sittings on the whole sufficiently successful and impres-
sive for it to be worth while to invite eminent men of science, and
on one occasion a well-known conjurer, to witness them.
Mr. Hodgson arrived from America after the twelfth sitting.
What he did was to systematise the observations. He was, of course,
an experienced observer, and had given much attention to tricks
of various kinds, both as practised by mediums and by professional
conjurers. At his first sitting he observed the narrowing of the
hand as Lady Stanley had done. It was at his second sitting, the
fourteenth of the series, that he was able to observe the whole pro-
cess of substitution, and the way one hand represented both while
the other was free. The more important part of the report of this
sitting was printed in the S.P.R. Journal, Vol. VII., pp. 151-5, and I
need not repeat it here. After this others of us were able to observe,
over and over again, the process of freeing a hand or a foot. It was
done with skill, care and caution, 1
and evidently with deliberation.
1
1 should like to say that after our Cambridge experiences I realised that
secure holding under the conditions allowed is much more difficult than I
had previously supposed, and I should not now attribute unusual gullibility
to any one who failed to detect the substitution. I say this because I expressed
a different view after certain experiences at Carqueiranne. See Journal,
Vol. VI., p. 340. On that occasion I held the left hand, and Dr. Segard was
responsible for the right hand. An accordion placed near was passed on to
the table between Dr. Segard and the medium at about the level of their
shoulders, and against a faintly-illuminated background I could see it being-
brought forward by what looked like the outline of a hand and arm, which
I should have felt sure were Eusapia's right hand and arm, had not Dr. Segard
been sure he was holding her right hand. Later, each time Professor Richet,
who was under the table holding Eusapia's feet, said he was touched, I could
see her stooping about as much as was, I should judge, required in order to
touch him with her right hand. Each time I asked Dr. Segard whether he
was really sure that he was holding the right hand, and he said he was.
Since our Cambridge experiences I have felt no doubt that the right hand
was free, and that I had allowed the left hand with mine holding it to approach
Dr. Segard and represent two hands. But I do not now think this argues
unusual ineptness as observers either in Dr. Segard or myself.
522 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part
After studying the notes of our previous experiences, and compar-
ing with them what we now perceived, we felt no doubt that the
trick had been practised throughout, and that no holding under any
such conditions as prevailed at Eusapia's sittings is to be relied on.
We, and especially Mr. Hodgson, have been blamed for allowing
Eusapia to get her hand free when we began to see what was
happening. 1
I cannot understand this point of view. When there
seems to be a clue to the modus operandi the only scientific pro-
cedure is surely to follow it wherever it may lead—whether to
exposure of fraud or proof of genuineness. Before we realised the
clue, through twelve sittings, we had done our best under such
conditions as Eusapia would allow to obtain phenomena of whose
genuineness we could feel no doubt, so that she had had every
opportunity of proving her powers to be supernormal, if proof was
possible. The result was that the evidence depended almost entirely
on the holding of hands and feet, and in connexion with this hold-
ing there were suspicious circumstances. It became, therefore, of
the utmost importance to follow any clue which might enable us
to estimate the value of holding such as Eusapia allowed.
I have dwelt thus long upon our experiences at Cambridge,
although so much of the tale has been already told, partly because
I do not think Professor Morselli has altogether understood what
happened there, and partly because it enables me to bring out
clearly in what resjjects and why my judgment differs from his.
He is evidently a good and careful observer, he is aware that
Eusapia Paladino does sometimes trick, and has, in fact, himself
1
There is another matter in which we have been blamed. A legend has
grown up in France and Italy that we treated Eusapia Paladino unkindly. I
do not know whether she is herself responsible for this legend. If she is, it
is perhaps not unnatural, but I think it is ungrateful. We did our best to
keep her happy and amused, and took a great deal of trouble about it, and
as far as we could judge were fairly successful, except during a day or two
when she was not well. She lived in Mr. and Mrs. Myers's house, and lived
with the family. She constantly played croquet in the garden with the
children, and after Mr. Hodgson came she played with great gusto with him ;
we used to take her out shopping (at our expense), in which she delighted,
and to take her out for carriage drives and sight-seeing expeditions, e.g. to
London. Professor Morselli speaks of some offensive searching to find trick
apparatus to which she had been exposed somewhere, and suggests that it
was at Cambridge. The nearest approach to this that I ever heard of was
that on one or two occasions, after a good stance, Mrs. Myers accompanied
her to her bedroom when she went up to bed, helped her to undress, and
folded her clothes for her.
LVI.] Revieiv. 523
sometimes detected her in trickery or what looked suspiciously like
it. But he appears to think that when on any particular occasion
trickery has not been detected by sensible persons responsible for
watching the medium, the presumption is that it has not occurred.
In this I cannot agree. I have not the same confidence that he
has in my own or any one else's powers of continuous observation,
especially in darkness or semi-darkness ; and when it has been
shown that a medium systematically practises trickery, the pre-
sumption, I think, is that on any particular occasion when an
unexplained phenomenon takes place, an opportunity for trickery
unobserved by the investigator has been found. It must be
remembered that the medium is not bound to produce phenomena
at any given time. If no opportunity occurs nothing need happen.
In this a tricking medium is at a great advantage as compared
with an ordinary conjurer.
I do not profess to explain everything that is described by Pro-
fessor Morselli. Most of it is not difficult, if a free hand or foot
is granted ; but I think there are other tricks, and any explanation
of them I might offer would be conjectural. I may point out that
even a professional conjurer could not probably explain a conjuring
trick with which he was unfamiliar from the description of a witness
who had not detected it. It is because essential points have not
been observed that the observer has been puzzled. Mr. S. J. Davey's
experiments give proof of this, if proof be needed.
Some phenomena which the freeing of a hand or foot will not
explain should be mentioned in addition to the materialisation
phenomena already referred to when the medium was tied to the
bed behind the curtain. On another occasion (Vol. I., pp. 441-6),
part of the experience described seems to require her to have freed
herself completely, so as to be able to leave the table and go behind
the curtain. Of a different kind, but again not depending I think
on failure in holding hands, are certain levitations of the table,
especially one described in Vol. I., p. 424. Mr. Hodgson gave some
attention to this subject, and was himself able to hold up a heavy
table a foot off the ground in a manner resembling Eusapia's, by
passing a band round his shoulders, under his waist-belt, and round
a leg of the table. In the particular case above referred to, the
table seems to have risen too high for this method. Experiments
in the raising of tables by this and other mechanical means should
be tried, if importance is to be attached to the phenomenon.
Another phenomenon, where there is no question of holding hands
524 Mrs. Henry SidgwicL: [part
or feet, was the movement of a small bell along the table and
other movements of objects in a good light in a manner which
would be explained if we could suppose the use of a thread (see
Vol. L, p. 425, and Vol. II., pp. 202-3).
One more point. Importance has been attached to the question
whether Eusapia Paladino is genuinely entranced during the occur-
rence of at least part of the phenomena. I think it probable that
she is. Professor Morselli thinks so, and he and other medical
observers ought to know. This might be important if it were our
business to decide on the degree of moral blame attaching to the
normal Eusapia, though I think that a strong case could be made out
for collusion between her normal and trance consciousness. But in
deciding the matter actually before us, namely, what the evidence
is for attributing the physical phenomena produced by Eusapia to
hitherto unknown powers, the question whether she was entranced
seems to me of no importance whatever. Systematic trickery may
be practised in a frequently recurring auto-hypnotic condition as well
as in a normal one.
In conclusion, Professor Morselli's work gives the added weight
of his authority to that of other eminent persons who have con-
vinced themselves that Eusapia Paladino, notwithstanding trickery,
does exhibit phenomena which cannot be explained by known
physical or biological laws. He admits, however, that in order to
obtain any real understanding of these extended biological powers,
examination of them in the case of some person who will allow
real scientific experiment is necessary, and he does not intend to
spend more time on Eusapia. If, in spite of all that has been said
about her, I personally still doubt whether the prima facie case for
believing in a residuum of genuine phenomena in her case is
sufficient, it is owing to a long course of experiment and disillusion-
ment with fraudulent physical mediums. Nevertheless I do not
at all deny that there are grounds for thinking that such extended
powers do exist, and if so, their investigation is very important.
Our hope of discovering the truth about them lies in their being
developed in private persons willing to take trouble and allow in-
vestigation, and should Professor Morselli's work stimulate and lead
to the discovery of such persons, it will not have been thrown away.

The Naturalisation of the Supernatural, by Frank Podmore.
(G. P. Putnam's Sons; New York and London, 1908. 374 pp.
Price 7s. 6d. net.)
The title of this most attractive and very useful book is un-
doubtedly to a certain extent misleading. If by " naturalisation
"
is meant—as seems indeed obvious—" explaining away on natural
[in the everyday sense of the word] lines," then Mr. Podmore
leaves a good deal unexplained. Practically out of the whole domain
of Psychical Research, 11
Poltergeists " and clairvoyance at close
quarters seem to be almost the only two groups of alleged " pheno-
mena" towards which he still maintains an uncompromisingly negative
attitude. That he should admit the reality of telepathy (and by
the way, whilst fully realising the stupendous difficulties which stand
in the way of a physical explanation, Mr. Podmore sees grounds for
hoping that these difficulties may ultimately diminish, see p. 14) is
of course not to be wondered at. But the position he has taken
up in the work under consideration especially towards the spirit-
hypothesis and even, to a certain extent, towards the "Physical
Phenomena of Spiritualism " appears to me more unexpected. It
strikes me as somewhat significant that the chapter on " Spiritualism
"
(chiefly devoted to recounting Davey's slate-writing feats) should,
close as follows
:
"It cannot be said that these recent researches [with Eusapia
Paladino] have done much to strengthen the case for Eusapia's
genuineness. . . . But if we can attach little weight to the records,
it is impossible not to be impressed by the scientific standing and
the obvious sincerity of the witnesses . . . [who] have no manner
of doubt that they have witnessed in Eusapia's presence phenomena
inexplicable by any known force. If they do not enable us to share
their conviction, they at any rate compel us to hold our judgment
in suspense. There is at any rate a problem here, for the solution
of which we must wait. If the things are genuine, we want to
know how they are done ; if fraudulent, how it is that so many
competent observers have come to believe in their genuineness
"
(pp. 201-2).
526 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo, [part
More suggestive still are many passages in the sections of the
book dealing with such topics as "Communication with the Dead"
(Ch. IX.), "Messages received through trance and automatism"
{Ch. XII), " Haunted Houses" (Ch. XI.) and the inevitable Mrs. Piper
(Ch. XIII.). Mr. Podmore admits that "those investigators who
of recent years have given the closest study to the case of Mrs. Piper
and other automatists have been led to attach increasing weight
to the hypothesis of some form of spirit-communication "
(pp. 207-8)
;
he does not deny that " we have clearly no right to lay down a priori
a standard to which spirit-communication should conform " (p. 208)
;
and a propos of Professor Miinsterberg's preposterous statement
{Psychology and Life, p. 252) :
" [With regard to the question] whether
departed spirits enter into communication with living men by mediums
and by incarnation the scientist does not admit a compromise
;
... he flatly denies the possibility . . . the facts as they are
claimed do not exist and never will exist," he says :
"The man who at the present stage of the enquiry invites us
on the strength —or weakness—of the evidence so far available to
acclaim the proof of human immortality, may be doing serious injury
to his own cause. But the other man who, because our present
ignorance does not enable us to decide what is the true meaning
of these elusive 'seemings,' condemns the whole enquiry as abortive,
has surely no title to speak in the name of science "
(p. 210).
Mr. Podmore thinks that if some peculiarly striking cases accumu-
lated by the Society for Psychical Research should ultimately be
multiplied, the conclusion of post-mortem agency " would no doubt
appear less dubious" (p. 274); he admits that "the assumption of
an alien personality speaking through the entranced person " has
been in certain cases made "by observers whose training and special
knowledge render them peculiarly qualified to form a judgment in
such matters " (p. 284, footnote) ; and he winds up his account of
Mrs. Piper by pointing out, though, it is true, in a dubious form,
that "in certain cases, at any rate, we may come somehow into
contact with the minds of the dead "
(p. 329). As we see, in spite
of the book's delusive title, a good deal of the " Supernatural " has
not been " naturalised " by Mr. Podmore.
As I have just mentioned Mrs. Piper by name, I may as well
point out that I do not consider all the samples of the evidence
brought forward by the author in the chapter dealing with the
celebrated Boston Pythoness as altogether satisfactory. I must
especially protest against Mr. Podmore's summing up in less than
LVI.] Revieiv. 527
two pages (pp. 317-318) of such an episode as "Uncle Jerry's" in
Mrs. Piper's English sittings in 1889. The account is given, it is
true, in Sir Oliver Lodge's words, but slightly abridged ; but in
Proceedings, Vol. VI., where the same account is printed, the reader
may also find, if he chooses to, the original notes of Sir Oliver's
sittings covering many pages, and I think that after he has waded
through, his impression may be somewhat different. For in such
highly-condensed accounts, especially if drawn up by a sympathetic
observer, stress will naturally be laid on the chief episodes, many
attending circumstances and seemingly unimportant details being-
omitted and the " messages " being given not in the piecemeal fashion
in which they occurred, but in a coherent and impressive form, with
the main facts standing out in bold relief. But in Sir O. Lodge's
account mention is at least made of some of "Uncle Jerry's" mes-
sages being false (p. 459), whilst in Mr. Podmore's all reference
to this circumstance has dropped out. The impression on the
uninitiated reader's mind may consequently be the deeper—but it
will be an impression to a considerable extent erroneous. (With
the circumstance that many, if not most, of the incidents narrated
for evidential purposes by " Uncle Jerry " were exactly such as arise
in the experience of almost nine out of ten human boys I am not
concerned here.)
Mr. J. T. Clarke's account of his sitting with the same medium
(pp. 311-316) is more satisfactory, technically speaking; but much
in Phinuit's statements to him which he thinks very remarkable
strike me as much less so, and I believe that, after an inspection
by no meaus too severe, but little remains even as evidence of
telepathy. The most curious thing is that Mr. Podmore should not
apparently disapprove of Mr. Clarke putting down as "correct"
such statements as "there is lots of trouble all over you, but I see
light beyond . . . you will wade through it all right in the end "
—
which statement bears a most suspicious resemblance to the common-
place fortune-teller's twaddle ; nor of the same gentleman writing-
in all seriousness :
" My child was in Germany at the time, and thus lived in my
memory rather than in my daily view. Hence although the
medium felt that she was alive . . . her personality was yet spoken
of as 'in the spirit.'
"
Phinuit, it should be said, in answer to a question as to the
whereabouts of the sitter's daughter, had begun by saying: "She
is in the spirit," but had quickly added :
" That is to say, her
528 Goun t Perovshy-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part
spirit is here, but her body is at a distance." One may conclude,
without being a hypercritical person, that Phinuit's correction was
due merely to Mr. Clarke having betrayed in some wajr
that the
first shot had been wide of the mark. This gentleman prefers
another explanation; but does Mr. Podmore endorse itl
I also think that a statement such as that the sitter has an
uncle named John (on which, by the way, Phinuit did not insist
when contradicted) even if proved correct afterwards, should not be
considered particularly evidential (p. 313); nor do I find much
resemblance between two such names as Williamson (first said to be
Williams) and Lambertson (p. 312); nor do I think that "changing"
my "house" is identical in meaning with my wife being "away
from her house" (p. 315) ; nor does it strike me as very extraordinary
that a piano and a clock should be the chief features of two particular
rooms (p. 316). It is, I think, somewhat unfortunate that such
a sitting should have been brought forward by Mr. Podmore as a
sample of the Piper evidence, and presumably a particularly favourable
one.
The " G. P." communications, indeed, stand on a different footing.
But here objections of another kind arise.
The question which will naturally first present itself to the reader
is: What opportunities did Mrs. Piper have to obtain information
about G. P., his friends and circumstances, by normal means % The
fact that in other cases she undoubtedly made no private enquiries
(for in the great majority of cases the poorest amateur detective
would have done far better than her " controls ") is after all no
definite proof. There may have been exceptional facilities in
G. P.'s case. (He died in New York in 1892, and Mrs. Piper
was there at the time.) If so, what importance can we attach,
for instance, to G. P. having mentioned to the Howards by name his
friends Berwick and Orenberg 1 (Mr. Podmore, p. 325). The question
is : Could or could not Mrs. Piper have learnt by normal means that
G.P. had friends of that name 1 If she could not, this ought, I
think, to have been so stated, possibly with the grounds for such
a conclusion. If she could—well, the incident is evidentially worth-
less, and if so, what is the use of adducing it? Taking a professional
medium's honesty for granted in an enquiry involving issues so
momentous, even in one particularly striking instance, seems to me a
risky thing.
I say " particularly striking " because, as a general rule, the Piper
spirits so persistently avoid giving surnames, whilst revelling in
LVI.] Revieiv. 529
Christian names (especially of the William-Mary-John type). This
is already bad enough ; and so it is the more unfortunate that
such a rara avis as this " Berwick-Orenberg " incident should be
apparently open—without, I think, undue straining—to a natural
interpretation.
This avoiding of surnames is indeed a very curious thing. I can
understand an order of existence in which all names, Christian and
others, should be dropped, though I do not well see what could
be used instead with equal convenience. But on what charitable
hypothesis can we understand the persistence of one set of names
and the discarding of the other 1 And, again, suppose there were
only three surnames in existence for Englishmen and Americans,
• say Smith, Jones and Roberts : would it be too hard on Mrs. Piper
to conjecture that they would turn up much oftener than they
do now 1
To return to G-. P., Mr. Podmore, who notes in passing (p. 328)
that even that spirit has on more than one occasion evaded test
questions put to him, might have added, I think, that not content
with this, Gr. P. has repeatedly given false information (Proceedings,
Vol. XIII., p. 303, 334, 335). He is also responsible for corroborat-
ing false statements made by other Piper spirits .(Proceedings, Vol.
XV., p. 24) and his way of constantly referring to books lent to his
friends without ever giving the title of the book is distinctly
irritating.
I confess I am to a certain extent in sympathy with Mr. Andrew
Lang when I find him saying
:
"If Mr. H., or Phinuit, or G. P. were honourable spirits [i.e. what
they pretend to be] they would say they don't know, when they
don't know. They would not give false information, '
natural enough
'
(easily guessed) but totally wrong" (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XV.,
p. 42).
'
And again :
"That spirits in the next life making use of Mrs. Piper's brains,
nerves, voice and hands, should be confused is intelligible. But
why should they be impudently mendacious, absurdly ignorant and
furtively evasive; fluent in twaddle and 'groping' when a simple
question as to something familiar to them when alive is asked?"
{ibidem).
Of course such a picture, if intended for Gr. P., is too darkly
•coloured ! I admit that some incidents connected with him are
decidedly startling (perhaps chiefly those which we are not
530 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part
allowed to know in detail : see especially Proceedings, Vol. XIII. pp.
321-322) but precise^ in order to appreciate them at their true
value we must have all the features of the episode before us in
equal prominence, positive and negative. Otherwise Mr. Podmore's
readers (especially if his reputation of an out-and-out sceptic has
reached them) will be apt to become too frantically enthusiastic
about G. P. and other Piperites, and surely frantic enthusiasm is not
a mood suited for our researches !
Again, remarkable as is the fact that many of G. P.'s former
friends became convinced, after sitting with Mrs. Piper, that they
had been conversing with him in propria persona, Mrs. Sidgwick's
very pertinent remarks on this subject may, I think, advantageously
be read. Says she :
" The representation given of the deceased person must from the
nature of the case be of a very limited kind. For instance, when
the soi-disant G. P. communicates, he usually does so in writing, the
whole of Mrs. Piper's body except the hand being in an inert con-
dition. At the best, therefore, he is limited to the words he writes
and to the possibilities of dramatic representation of a person's
whole maniere d'etre through the movements of the hand alone. The
hand-writing ... is not like that of the living G. P. The case is not
materially improved when the communication is by spoken words,
for gesture and expression and voice are still excluded from the like-
ness and the '
language shows a tendency to depart more or less
from the language that would have been used by the communicator
when living.' 1
A likeness under these circumstances must bear to*
a full dramatic representation of a person somewhat the relation
that a clever pen and ink sketch done in a few strokes bears to a
finished portrait in oils" (Proceedings, Vol. XV., p. 21).
In short, most of such impressions, however convincing personally,
do not easily lend themselves to scientific estimation, and can hardly
eutrer en ligne de compte. (See in the same article by Mrs. Sidgwick,
a little further on, mention of a case when the personation of G. P.
was not thought successful, the sitter, Mr. Marte, also carrying on
with G. P. a conversation on " philosophical " subjects ; and a very
queer conversation on G. P.'s side it was, see pp. 26-7.)
I do not deny that it is very remarkable that (Mr. Podmore, p. 326)
G. P. recognised all his friends who visited Mrs. Piper under assumed
names, in no case making a mistake. Still with all that—though
this must be of course a question of "personal equation"—I must

say that after reading one such narrative as " Miss Morton's " (Mr.
Podmore, pp. 266-271, in the chapter on "Haunted Houses") I
have felt myself nearer something like an invisible world than after
perusing hundreds of pages of the Piper records.
Turning to other sections of the book, I will make one general
remark-. It seems to me that somewhat undue prominence is given
by Mr. Podmore to dreams as evidence of supernormal faculties.
He makes up a very conclusive case against them from this point
of view, giving at length the various reasons for their evidential
inferiority (pp. 76-80) ; but theory is one thing and practice another,
and throughout the 365 Da°;es of Mr. Podmore's book we meet with
dreams not infrequently. That the amount of coincidence involved
in such a case as the one quoted on p. 343, where the percipient
dreams of ducks buried in sand with heads protruding at a certain
spot, only to learn a few hours afterwards that her dream corresponded
exactly with actual facts, is such as to make explanation by
chance coincidence extremely improbable, there can be no doubt
;
but in this respect the incident in question is almost, though not
quite, unique ; and some of the other instances of dream-fulfilment
given in the book seem to me decidedly less striking and hardly
beyond the scope of chance coincidence, which no doubt gives
occasionally results equally striking, as anybody, and I in par-
ticular, can testify from personal experience.
Should not therefore dreams, and death dreams in particular, be
given a wide berth in " Psychical Research " as a general rule,
—
a rule which should be infringed in very exceptional cases only 1
But it is perhaps time to bring this review to a close. I can only
take leave of Mr. Podmore's unusually interesting, very candid and
very much up-to-date book with hearty wishes for its success. May
it very soon reach a second edition to begin with, in which case
I would suggest to Mr, Podmore the desirability of depriving the
late Mr. Aksakoff of a title —that of Professor—which he never-
possessed (p. 292).
