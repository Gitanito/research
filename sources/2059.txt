:r;zoceeded through a long CIOTered p~e till we took·a :f-ort
tomto the left, 1000 after whioh we i'eached ~he door of theeohool•.
room. On my entraDGe, the Superior met me, and told me lnt
of all that I moat dip mr B.ngen into the holy water at her door,
01'011 myaelf, and 11\ya ihort prayer; and tbia abe told me 1rUal•,
waya required of Proteatu.t aa well u O"tholio ohildreD. • ·
There were about B.fty Kirla in the aohool, and the nun• piofel•
led to teaoh aomething o!· reading, writing, arithmetic, and R"• ; ·
graphy. · The methode, ho:wever, were very im,tl8rfeot, and Uttle
attention waa·devoted to ·them, the time being 1n a (fi'Ut degree .
engroued 1rith leaeonain needle-work, whioh wu performed with
much akill. The nuns had no Tery regular parta Uligued them

(that'a a He,) and u mon Dieli," (my God,) ou the moat tri'rial-oo•
caaiona. Their writini waa quite poor, and it wu not uncommon
for them to put a oap1talletter in the middle of a word. The
only book of·geography which we atudied, wu a cateohiam of
geopaphy from whiClh we leam*'by.heart a few quelltiona and 1 •
anawen. We were IOVJetimea referred tb a map, but it wu only ·
to ~int out Montreal or Que!leo, or aome other prominent name, -
while we had no inatruction beJond. · 1 , · ••
It ID&f be D8Gelll&ry, for the Information of lOme Ofmy re&den,
to mention, that there are three distinct Oonventa lo Montreal,
all of diJ!erent kinda-that is, founded on diJ!erentplana, and go.;
verned by different rulea. Their.namea are aa follow• :- ' •
1. The Oongre~tational Nuunery. ·
2. The Black Nunnery, or Convent of Sister Bourgeoue. : ·" ·
3. The Grey Nunnery. . -
The tlnt of these profellll&l to be devoted entirely to the eiiu-
catlon of girla. It would require, however only a proper eumi·
nation .
to prove, that with tile exception of needle-work. hardlJ
~ythinr 11 taught excepting prayer and cateohiam; the loatruo-
tion in. ieadintr, writing, &a...~.in faut, amounting to nry Uttle,
and often to nothing. This uonvent i1 adj&llent to the nut to
be 1Poken of, being separated from it only by a wall. The .._ . ·

Sometimee the Superior of a Oonnnt obtaina the character of
working miraolee: and when euoh an one dies, it il pubUehed
thl'ougli the country1 and crowda throng the 0oD1'ent, who think
indulgencee are to be deri1'ed from bite of her clothea and other,
tbinia she hae po118aaed ; and many han eent articlee to be
touched to her bed or chair, in which a degree of1'irtne·iathought
to remain. I used to participate iri ench ideu and feeling-, and .
began by degree• to look nJft)n a nun •• the happiest of women,
and a 00n1'ent ae the moat peaceful, holy, and delightful plaoe of
abode. It is true, lOme pains were taken to impreu such 1'iewa
upon me. Some of the prieeta of thet Seminary often: 1'ilited the
Oongre~tional Nunnery, and both cateohiaed and talked with.
ueon religion. The Superior of the Black Nunnery adjoining,
alao, oooUionally came into the echool1 and enlarged On the ad·
1'1Ultage we enjoyed in ha1'ing euoh teachere, and drop~ lOme-
thing now and then relating to her own convent, calculated to
make 111 entertain the higheet ideaa of it, -and make ueometimee
think of the poelibilitf of getting into it.
Among the inetrnctione given to ue by the priee~ eome of the
molt pomted were directed againat the Proteetan~.JSible. They ·
often enlarged upon the e1'il tendency of. that book, and told us
that but for it many a eoul condemned to hell, and suJfering eter·
nal punishment, might han been in happineu. They oould·not
A.l ~ytbing in ite fa1'our ; for that would be epeakiog against
religion and it.gainst God. They warned ue againat ite woe, and·
reprMented it ae a thing 1'eey dangerous to our eoula. In conflr-

I had been informed by the Superior, on m7 flrat admillfon u
· a nun, that then wu a aubterraneoua pauage, leadingftom the
ceUar of our ConTent, into that of the Congregational NuDilerf:
but, though I had 10 often 'rilited the cellai, I had neTer aeen 1t.
·One day, &Iter I had been reoeh·ed three or four moutha, I waa
aeut to walk through It on my kneea, with another uuu, u a pen·
auce. Thia, and other peu&Doet, were aometimea put upon ua by
the prluta, without anr reuon &llilfDed. The oolilmon war, in·
deed, w.- to tell ua of the ain for which a penance wu impo.ed,
•but we were left maar timea to oonjeotlll'e. Now and then the
prleat would inform ua at a nbaequent ooufeuion, when he hap·
peneCI to reoollect e.Qmething about it, aal thought, and not be-
oauae he reflected or cared much upon the mbject.
. The nun who wu with me led through the cellar, pUling to
the right of the aecret burial-place, and lhowed me the door of .
the aubterraneoua p&IISge, whtch W81 at the e:dreurlty towarda
the Congregational Nunnel'J. The reaaona why I had not notic-
edit before, I pre1ume, were, that it waa made to abut cloae and
eTen with the wall : and all that part of the cellar wu white-
wuhed. The door, which i~ of woocJ, and square, o~nl !fth a
latch into a puaage ab9ut four feet and-a half high. We lmme-
~tely got upon our kneea, oommenced 11yiug the pnyera re-
quired, and began to move alowly along the dark and narrow
puaage. It may be fifty or aixty feet in length. When wereaob-
ed the end, we opened a door, and found ouraelvu in the cellar
of the Congregational NDDnel'J, at aome diatanoe from the outer
wall ; for the ooYered way ie carried on toward• the middle ofthe
oellar by t.,o low partition• covered at the top. By_the' aide of
the door wu plaoed a li1t of namea·of the Blaok Nuna, with a
alide that miglit be drawn onr any of them, We conred our
namea in tbil m&Dner, ae evidence of having performed the duty
aalisned ua ; and thPI\ retumed downward• on our kneel, by: tbe

We were frequently uaured that mirao181 are atill performed;
and paiua were taken to impreae ua deeply_on thia au6ject. The

remaina of whioli. are pretended to he preHmld in the Oonnnt,

Often and often, while perfect silence prevailedamong the nuna,
at meditation, or while nothing waa to be beard except the voice
of the reader appointed for the day, no matter whoie lite or writ·
inp were prea;.:nted for our contemplation, Jane would break
forth with *<nbe remark or queotion, that would attractgeneral at•
tention, and often caun a long and total interruption. Sometila'JI
ahe would make 10me barmleu remark or inquiry aloud '· ai ·u

voice, 10 strongly aa110cfnted 1t'ith every tbi~ atngular and ridf..

·• pl7 oalculated to irritate atlll further, or to prove U every one

Alarming order from the Superior-Proceed to uecot<! ft-Seioe foo aD up.

iDade to friends ot St. Fran011. ,
BVT I moat now ~me to one deed in which I had some part;and
which I look. back upon with greater honor and pain than any
occurrence• in the OOnnnt, in which I wa.e not the p~nolpaliUf­
ferer. •It ia oot necelll&l'y for me to attempt to excuse myaelf in
this or 110_1 other cue. Those who have any dilpolitioo tojudge
fairly, wUl exdreiae their own judgment in making allowanoeefor
me, onder the fear and force, the command and e:umple1, before
.mo.. ',I, therefore, ahall. ~o01lne myaelf, ae uaual, tO the limple
D&l'l'ation of facta. '!'he tUDe wu about five month• after I took
the Teil, the weather waa cool, perhapa in September or October.
One day, the.Superior aent for me and aeveral other nuna, to re-
ceive her commands at a particular room. We found the Bilbo])
and 10me priests with her : ·and epeaking in an unuaual tone of
1leroeneu and authorjty,lhe laid, "Go to the room for the Ex-
amination of Oonacience, and draK St. Frances up stairs." No- '
thing more wu neceuary than tliia unuaual command, with the
tone and manner which accompanied it, to ezcite in me the moat
·g_loomy anticipationa. It did not atrike me ae etrange that St.
J!'ranoea should be in the room to which the Superior directedus.
It wu an apartment to which we were often aeut to prepare for,
the communion, and to which we voluntarily went, whenever we
felt the oompuoctiona which our ignorance of duty, and the mi-.
lnatructi.one w.e received, inclined ua to aeek relief from aelf-~
proaoh., Indeed l had aeen her there a little .before. What ter-
iifted me W&l, flnt; the Superior's angry manner ; aeoond, the u-
pret :Jion abe uaed, being a French term, whoae peculiar uae I had
leamt in the ConTent, and whose meanlDg fa rather10ftenedwhen
tranalated into clrag; third, the plaoe to which we were direCted
to take the intereating young nun, and the persona uaembled
there, u I auppoaed1 to condemn her. M:y fean were such, oon- •
oemiog the fate that; awaited her, and my honor. at the idea that ·
abe wu in 10me way to be eacriiloed, ~t I would havelriva
au~c to be allowed to etay where I wu. But I feareil tu .•

" Saint Fnnoee, we are Mnt for you." · ·,

t8qa oame into my eyea. I had not a momeot'e doubt that ehe
oolllidered her fate ae aealed, au.d wae already bey,oud'the fftt.r of

whioh wu near b7, and then Mized by herlimbe and clothel.aad
lo faot almoat dragged up et.in, in the een• the 8u~or bad

We all belleTed In ghoat•; and it wal notwonderful that lOCh
an object 1hould oauee alarm, especially a1 it was but a 1hort
time after the death of one of the nune. Thue they went on,
each getting a friaht in tnro, yet all afraid to •peak. At length,
one more alumecf, or with leu preeence of mrnd than· the re1t,
ezclaimed, II Oh, mon Dien l je ne me oouoheti.ie pael" When
the night watch called out," Who'• thatP"Ihe oonfeued abe had
broken eileilce, but pointed at the oauee; and when all the qUDI
aeeembled at a dietanoe from the winaow, Jane offered to ad·
.vance boldly, and a10ertain the nature of the apparition, whiob
they thought a moat re10lute intention. We alletood looking on1
when abe etepped to the window, drew in the broomatict, anc&
ahowed n1 the ridiculoue puppet whioh had alumed 10 many 111-
pentitioue fe1n. - ' .
Some of her greateet feats ahe performed as a lleep-walter.
Whether abe ever walked in her eleep or not, I am unable, with
certainly, to hf·! She, however, often imposed upon the Superi•
or, and old nune, by making them think ao, when I knew 1he did
not; and yet I cannot positively 1ay that abe alwaye did. I have . •
remarked that one of the old nuns waa alwa-,a placed·in 0111' - .
1leeping-room at night, to watch u1. Sometrmea abe would be
inattentive, and 10metime1 f&ll into a doze. - Jane Ray often seis·
ed IUOh timee to riee from her bed, and walk about, oocaeionally
aeizing one of the nona in bed, in order to frighten her. This 1be l '
generally effected; and many time1 we have been awakened by
10ream1 of terror. In our alarm, 10me of ua frequently broke
ailence, and gave ocoaeion to the Superior to tar ue ·under pen•
ancee. Many timee, however, we 81C&ped With a mere npri.
mand, while Jane ueually received upreaaione of compaaaion:
"Poor creature; abe would not do 10 if abe were in perfect po..
eeaeion of her rea10n." And Jane displayed her cuetomary ·art.
fulneas, in keeping up the false imprcaeion. AI 1000 ae 1he per•
ceived that the old nun was likely to obeerve her, abe would
throw her ume about, or appear unoon10ioue of what abe wae do-
ing ; falling upon a bed, or standing etook-still, until exertion1
·had been made to rouse her from her enppoeed lethargy. :·.;
We were once allowed to drink cider at dinner, wbioh wu
quite an eztraordinary favour. Jane, however, on account of her ·.
negligence of all work1 was denied the privilege, which abe much
reaeuted. The nest aay, when dinner arrived, we began to taate
our uew drink, but it was ao alt we could not ewallow it. Thol8
of us who flnt diaoovered it were ae ueual afraid to apeak; but
we 1et down our cupa, i.nd looked around, till the othen made
the ame diecovery, which they allaoou did, and moat of them in
the aame manner. Some, however, at length, taken by 1urprlee,
uttered lOme ludicrous exclamation, on taatiug the laltsd .oi.der,
and then an old nun, looking acroaa, would cry out-: .· · ·
"Ah I tu oaue~la lilence." (Ah; you've broken ailence.) •
And thus we 10on got a laughing, beyond our ·power of np.
porting it. At recreation.that day, the flrat queetion uked by

~Uea, ·~• mixed them with the atraw. At night, .the ftnt of
them that got into bed felt the thiaUea, and cried out. Thenight-
'tratoh exclaimed ua ueual, "You are breaking ailence there,"
And then another aoreamed u abe wu acratched by the thiltlea0
and another. The old nun then called on all who h•d broken li·
lenoe to riM, and ordered them to aleep under their, beda aa a

The utmoat confueion preniled; for although we had I011aml7

were"eztremely alarmed, and oonld not repreu our feelfnp. We

- &Ten took her by the throat. La lUre called on all preaent to

the opportunity afforded in the confnlion, to beat 10me of her
wont euemies quite severely, and afterward laid, that ibe had
.intended to kill10me of the raacally informe:ra. • .
'For a time Jue made na laugh ao much at prayera, that the

I found the medit.ationa extremely tediona, and often did I aink

·great importance what we aaid, I aomethr:es found that I bad
nothing to tell but a dream, and told that, which ;puaed of! nry
well. '
Jane Bay appeared to be troubled atill more than myaelf with
WRndering thought.; and when blamed for them, would reply,
"I begin Tery well ; but directly I begin to think of some old
friend of mine, and my thoughts go a wandering from one conn• ·
tr1 to another." _ · . .. , , ·
" Sometime• I confeaaed my f:UUn.r aal!!ep,; and often the prieats

an cenerally not hudaome. I nenr learnt her name iaor uy.

name. She wu admitted·mthe morning, ud appeared melan·
oholy all day. Thia I obaened wu 'alwaya the oaae; and then-
marb made by othen, led me to believe that they, and all they
had acen, had felt ud and miaerable for a ltonger or :;barter time,
lllnn the Superior, at it may be recollected, confelll8d to me that
the experienCed the •am• feelinga when abe wu received. Wheu
bed-time arrived, abe proceeded to the chamber with the nat of
111, aild waa auigoed a bed on the aide of the room oppoaite my

piercing-and beart·rending thrieka proceed from our new com.

'::i>uld hear auch aounde, eepeoially in auoh total ailencet without
being greatly ucited. A general noiee succeeded, :ror many
voiou ~poke together, ntterinJ cries of aupriae, compaeaion, or
fear. It waa in vain for the night-watch to expect ailen~: for
onoe we forgot rule• and penances, and gavo vent to onr f~inga,
and abe could do notbiu.g but call for the Superior. . ·
.. I heard a man'• voice mingled with the cri~• l\nd Rhrieka ofthe
nun. Father Quib~ier, of the Seminary, I ha~ ·falt confident, waa
in the Superior'1 room at the time when we retired ; and aeyeral
of the nona afterwards aaaured me that it waa he. The Superior
eoon made her appearance, aud in a harah manner commanded ai·
lence. I heard her threaten gagging l!er, and then aay, "You are
no lletter than anybody elae, and if you do not obey, JOU aball be
aent to the cella." · ·
One young girl was taken into the Connnt during ·my abode
there, under peculiar circumstances. I waa acquainted with the
whole affair,.aa I wa1 employed to aot a part in it.
- Among the novice• was a young lady, of about. teTenteen, tbe
daughter of an old rioh Canadian. She bad been remarhble for
nothing that I know of, except the linlineae of her diapoaitlon.
The Superior once expreaaed to n1 a wi•h to ban her take the
veil, though the girl bereelf had nel'er auch intention that I know

mut neoeuarily reat chie8.y upon my ow11 word, until further
mdinoe can be obtained ; but there are ,,,me facta for whioh I
C&D appeal to the knowledge of othen. It ia commonl;y kDo-.
in lr!Oiitreal that aome of the prieata occaaionally wit_hdraw ·from
their cutomar;y employments, and are not to be aeen for aome
time; it being undentood that they have retired for relisiou-
atlldy, meditation, and devotion, .i.or the improvement of their
hearta. Sometimea they are thua withdrawn from the world for
three weeki : b11t there ia no fixed period. ' •
·Thia wae a fact 1 knew before 1 took the veil ; for it fa a fre-
queot aubject of remark, that auch and auch a Father ia on a'
"holy retreat." Thia ia a term which oonveya the idea of a reli·
gioua aecluaion from the world, for sacred purpol86'. On the 1'8•
appearance of a ·priest after such a period, in the churoh or the
atreeta. it ia natural to feel'a pecuhar impression of hia devout
cbaraoier-an impreaaion very different from that conveyed to the 1
mind who knows mattera ae they really are. Suspicions have ·
been indulged byaome in Canada on this subject, and facta are
known by at leapta few. I am able to ape&k from peraonal know-
·Jedge; for I have b'l8ri a nun of S<Bur Bourgeoise. ·
The priesta are liable, by their diaaolute habits, to occaaional
attacka of diaeaae, which render it neceeeary, or at leaet prudent,
to aubmit to modical treatment. ·
In the Black Nunnery they flnd private accommodation, for
the;y are free to enter oue of the private hoapitala whenever they
Jlleue ; which ia a room aet apart on purpoae for the aooommoda-·
' tio4 of the prieata, and is called a retreat:room. _But an excuae
ia necea~ to blind the public, and thia they find io the pretence
they make of being in a" H(\Jy Retreat.') Many a11oh caeeahave
I known ; and 1 can mention the namea of. m:ieata who have bee11 ,
conioed 111 thi11 Ho1Retreat. They are very carefully attended
bJ the Superior an old nune, and their diet oonaiata moatly of .
'Vegetable aoupe,' &c., with but little meat, and that freah. I have ·
aeen an inetr11ment of surgerylyiug upon the table in that holy ,
room, which ia ueed only for particll'l&l' purpoaea. , ·
Father Tombeau, a Rom~·.-.! prieat, wa. :)D orie of hie holy re·
tre&ta about the time whe~: .left the Nunnery. There areaome·
timea a number confined t'·Jre at the aame time. The victima of
theae prieata frequentlyahi .:te the aame fate.

To eoforoe thia upon ua, they employ varioua meaua. Someof

citiseo of Moutrual, wu walking near the oathedral, be aaw Sa-

in a lhort time, bringing in report. of their IDCC8111D leading
penona of different ol&lll81 to the commission of yarioaa lioa,
which they thought would be I!P.eeable to their ma1ter. 8atau
however, e:a:prealed hil dissatJafactioo, and ordered them out

..yuacl that, 'riaited Gilly DOW &Dd then by & 10litary DUD with
wbQm they were afraid to apeak their feelinp, and .with on\y the
miluable aocietr of each other ; how gloomy thua to epend day
after day, montht, and even yean, without any PI'OIPect of libe·
ration, uad liable at any moment to another fate to which the
BithoP or Snperiot might oondemn them. But theee poor ere&•
tune muat haTe known aomething of the horron perpetrated in
other11art1 of the buildin~, and oould not have been ignorant of
the hole in the cellar, wh1ch waa not far from the cell1, and the
aae to which it .w&l deToted, One of them told me, in confldenoe,
ahe wilhecl they oould get out. They mult alao ban been often
diltorlled in their aleep, if they ner did lleep, by the numerou
pri81tl WhO puaed through the trap-door at DO reat diltanoe,
To be aubject to ncb trials for a lingle day woul be dreadful;
but th.. nuna bad them to endure for yean.
I often felt much compallion for them, and wiahed to 188 them
nlealed ; but at other timea, yielding to the doctrine perpetually ·
taught 111 in the Convent, that our future happineu would be
proJI_Ortioned to the aufferinga we bad to undergo in thia world, I
woUld reat aatilfled that their impriaonment wu a real bleuing
tothem. · .
Othera, I preeume, participated with me in ncb feelinga, One .
Sunday afternoon, after we bad performed ·all our ceremoniea1
and were engaged aa uaual, at that time, with backgammon ana
other amuumentl, one of the young nuna exclaimed, " Oh 1how
headatrong are thoae wretches in the cella, they are aa bad u the
day they were put in I"
Thia exclamation wu made,.a~ I mppoled, in conaequeace of
aome recent convenaUon with them, a~ I knew her to De puti·
cularly acquainted with the older one.
Some oHhe vacant ~lla were occaaionallT uaed for teU'•:f-;r~y .
impriaonmint. Three none were.conflned 1u them, to my r.now-
ledge, for diaobeclience to the Superior, &I abe called it. They did .
not join the rost in tinging in tbe evening, being exbau~ in
the variou1 exertions of the day. The Superior ordered them to
lin•; and, &I they did not comply, after tlie command. had been
tW'loe repeated abe ordered them away to the cella.
They W!.re lu';mediately taken down into the cellar, placed in
~te dungeonl, and the door abut and bar~:11d upon them.
Tliere ther remained through the night, the followi?Jtr day aud
aeoond night, but were releaaed in time to attend man on the ae-
oond mornioEf.
The Supenor Died oocaaionally to •bow aomething in a rta.
boz, which we were required to regard with the highelt degree
of nverenoe. It wu m&de of wax, and called an Agnua Dei. She
uled to exhibit it to ua when we w1.1re in a atate of grace ; that it,
after oonfeulio:n and before Sacrament. She said it had been

lowed to entel'. I could only 10 to the door with a waiter of Je•

on the door, aud then retire to a diatance to await orden. When
anytbingwaa to be ~en away, it waa plaeed on the itaad by

The Bishop I uw at lean once, when he ap~ wone for

gave ua hia bleuiog, and put a piece ·•f pound cakeon the lboalder
of eaah of ua, in a manner which ar.peared 'singular and·foolilh.
· There are three rooma in tbe Bact Ncnnery, which .I never
entered. I had enj9yed much Uberty, and bad aeen, u I euppoa-
ed, all parte of the building, when one day I observed an old nun
go to a comer of an apartment: near the northern end of the w...
· tern wing, push the end'of her acieson into a craot in the panel·
led wall;' and tlDll out a door. I wu much eurpriaed, beoauae I '
never had conJectured that any door waa there; and it appear.
ed, when I afarwards ezamined the place, that no indioatfon of· ·
it could be dlabovered on thecloao&t scrutiny. I stepped forwal'd
to aee what waa within, and aaw three rooma opemng into each
other; but the nun refuaed to admit me within the door, whi( h
abe wiled to rooms kept u depositories. ·
·She henelf entered and oloaed the door, 10 thatI could not ut.
illy my curioaity ; and no occuion presented itaelf. I always
bad a atrong desire to know thll uae.of these apartment./· for I
am 11118 they muat have been d1laigned fot some purpoae o whioh
I waa inte~tionally kept ignorant, otherwise they never would
have remained unknown to me 10 long. Beside•, the old nun
evidently bad some itrong reuon for denying me admitaion,
though abe endeavoured to quiet my ourioaity.-
The Superior, after my admission into the Convent, had told
me I had acce11 to every room in the building; and l had seen
places which bore witneea to the crueltiea and the crimea com-
mitted uncler her oommanda or sanction ; but here waa a aueoel-
eion of rooma whioh bad been ooncealed from me, ad 10 oon·
etructed u if designed to be unknown to all but" l:.a."·· I am
aure that any person, who might be ablg t.o uamine the waD in
that place, would pronoonoe to.t aeoret door a surprising pieoe
.of wort. I never aaw anything of the kind which appean;.,: to
me ao ingenious and akilfully made. I told Jane Bay wht.t I had
aeen, and abe aaid at once, "We will get in and r ._a what ia
there." But I auppose abe never found an opportuni~,..
I naturally folt a good deal of curioaity to lear.
u wbetller nob
scenes, aa I hau witnaeeed in the death of Saint FraueN, were
oommon or ra~ and took an opportunity to inquire of Jane Bay.
Her reply wae-
" Ob, yea; and there were cu.ny JYlurdered while you were e
no'rioe, whom you baud nothing about."
Tbia waa all I ever learnt on thie subject ; ·but although I wae
told nothing of the maqner in whioh tbe1 were killed, I auppnee

doins 10. , We were under ttriot orden not to touch any ·of
them, and the idea of aina and penancetwu &Iwar• pruent in
mrmind.
Some time after the occaaion mentioned, I wu Hnt into the
Superior'• room with Jane, to arrange it; and u the aame book
wu ~ut of the oaae, the eaid, " OoiDe let us look into it." I
imm · 1 oon1ented, and we o~ed it, anct turned oYer ..,..·
eralleaTeL It wu about a foot and a half long, u :nearly u I
can remember, a foot wide, and about two inche1 thick, though I '
cannot epeak with particular precision, u Jane frightened meal·
111.o1t u eoon u I touched it, by exclaiming, "There, rou have
looked into it, arid if rou 'tell of me, I will of rou."
The thought of being aubjected to a eeTere penance, whioh I'
bad reuon to apprehend, fluttered me Tery mnch ; and, although
I tried to oover mr feara, I did not eucoeed T8l'f well. I refleot.
ed, however, that the lin wu already oomm1tted1 and that it
would not be increased if I eumined the book.
I therefore looked a little at aeveral pages, though I ltill felt a
good deal of agitation. I aaw at onoe that the volume wu are-
cord of the entrance of D'!Ula and n?Tioee into the OonTent, and
of the birth• that had taken Jllace inthe Ocnvent. Entriee af tbf.

· No mention wu made in the book of the death of the children,
though I well knew not one of them oould be liTiug at that time.
Now I preeume that the period the book embraced wu about
two yeare, u ee~eral .namee near the begiuuiniJ I knew; but I
oao form only a rongh oonjecture of the number <1f infante hom,

prompt intimation that I wu eent on a pre•aing million to the
Superior, prevented them from entertainmg a~ 1uepicion of my
intention, Relide1, I bad the written orden ol the phyllician iu

ly to be truated to remain t.•• 1. many of the othen.
The puaage which I no~ . eEa.Jhed bad several doon, with all

'1'H:E following cirOi1 ltzDo.. oompriM ~u that ia deemed neoea-

.AJter my uriftl in New Y.JI'k, 1 wu inboduoed to the alma-

in that ir.atitution I foand that it wu reported that I wu a
fugitin non ; and not long after, au Irish woman, belonging to
the bouae, brought me 1t eeoret m8111&Ce, which oaUied me eome
agitation. ,

~ not think to uold hbDil for it would he lmpouible f~ me to do eo,·
I mfaht conceal myH u well u I oould1 but I lhould he foucl
and taken. No matte~' where I went or what bidiDI•Plaoo I
might chooee, I 1hould he known; and I had bettercome at onoe..
He knew who I wu; ud he wu authoriHd to take me to.the
Silten of Charity, if l .lhould prefu to join them. Be wolllcl
promiH that I might etay with them if I cboH, and be permitt.d ·
to remain in ·New York. He HDt me word further that be had
rooeiYed full power and authority o't'er'me from the Ba~or of
the Hotel Dieu Nunnery at Montreal, and wu able to do all that ·
ehe could do ; as her right to di1poee of me at her will ba4 heeD
impUted to him by a regularwriting received from Canada. ·Thl•
waa alarming informAtion for me in the weakneu in which I wu
at th&t time. The woman added1
that the 1ame authority had
been given to all the priestl; eo tnat go where I might I lhollld
meet men informed about me and my eeca'pe, and fully empower•
ed to seize mo whenever th!IY could, and 0811vey me back to ~'le
OonYent from wilich I had eacaped. .
Under theae ciroum11tancea, it ~eemed to me that the offer to
place me llmong the Sistera of Charity, with permission to remain
1n New Yorkl wae mild and favourable. However, I badreeolu-
tion enough to refuH to 1ee priest Conroy.
Not long afterward• I wu informed, by the ame meHenger, ·
that the priest was again in the building, and repeated hi1 re-
quest. I desired one of the gentlemen connected with the iulti·
tution, that a atop might be put to 1noh m811agea, •• I wilhed to
receive no more of them. .A. ehort time after, boweYer, the wo-
man told me that Mr. Conroy wiabed to inqaire of me, whether ·
my name waa not St. Euatace while a nun, aad if I bad not oon-
fesaed to Priest Kelly in Montreal. I answered, that it wu all
true; for I bad confeiHd to him a ehort time while in the N•·
nery. I wu then told again thl'\t the priest wanted to He ae,
and I aent back word that I would aee him in the presence of
Mr. T--
. or :Hr. s-; which, however, W&l not agreed to ;
and I ••• afterward& informed, that Kr. Oonro:y, the Roman
priest, spent an hour in the room and a"pauage where 'I bad fre.
quently been; but, through the meroy ol God, I wae employed at
another place at that timo, and had no occaaion to go wnere I -.
should hne met him. I afterwards repeatedly heard, that Kr.
Conroy continued to visit the houae1
and to uk for me; ·but I
never aaw him. I once had determmed to lean the'institution1
and go to the Sisters of Charity; but oircnmatanoea ocourrea ·
which g&'t'e me time for farther rafteotion;. and I was aved from
the cleetrnction to which I should have beeo aposed.
AI the period of my accouchement approached, I IIC!metimet
thought that I lhould not aurvin it; and then the reoolleoaon of
'the dreadful crime• I bad witneued in the NuDD81'1 would come
upon me very powerlullf, ac1 I ld think it a eolema daty to
dieoloee them before I d1ed. To haTe a knowledgeof thOM tlaiDga,

10 muoh aazietyJ .I wu 8ittiq alone, and benD to iDcfulp iD n• •
Seotfooa of thia &Ind. It aeemed to me thai I mutt be near the
clo• of mJ life, and I determlaed to make a diaoloaure at once.
lapoke to Mn. Ford, a woman wboee obuuter ,I reapeoted, a
nurae ill the boapital, number twonty.three. llaformed her that
I bad no upeotation of li•lDg long, and had aome tbinp oo mr
milld which I wished to communicate before it ahould bi too late.
I added_, that I ahould prefer telling them to Kr. T-, the ghap·
laial 01 whlob lhe approTed, u abe considered it a duty to do 10,
UDder th0111 oiroumatanoe1. . I bad no opportunitr, bowe'ftl', to
convene with Kr. T. at that tim't a~, probablr, mr purpoH of
diaolOiinl the faote already given m trua boot, would ntTer have
been ueouted, but for what aubeequently took place,
It wu alarm which led me to form euch a determination; and
when the period of trial had been aately p&ll&d, and I had a proa-
pect of reoovery1 anything appeared to me more unlikely than
that I ahould make thie exposure. ·
I wae then a Roman Catholic, at leaat a ~r&at pari of my time; ·
and my conduct, in a great measure, wae according to the faith
and motive~ of a Roman Catholic. Notwithstanding what I knew
of the oonduot of 10 many of the prieata and nune, I thought that
it had no effect on the·eanctity of the chnroh, or the. authority or
effecta of the acta pedormed by the former at the masa, oonfel!•
aion, &o. I had such a regard for my vow• •• a .uun,'·that I oon·
sidered mr hood aa well aa my heart irrevocably tiven; to Jeaua
Ohriet, and could uever bavt. allowed auy pereou to take it, . In•
deed, to this day, I feel an iuatinctive aversion to offering my
band, or taking the hand of. another peraon, even u an exprea•
aion of friendship. ... •· .
I also thought that I mi!lht aoon return to the Catholi01, at.
though fear and diaguat held me back. I had now that infant to
thlni for, whoae. life I bad happily, aaved ~1 my t.imelr · eeoape
from the Nunnery ; what ite fate mtght be, 1n case 1t ehoald ever
fall into the power of the prieeta, I could not tell. ·'
' I had, however, reaaou for alllrlll. Would a ohild1 de1tiaed to
destruction, like the infanta I bad seen baptiaed ana emothered,
be allowed to go through the world unmolested, a livin1 memo-
rial of the truth o'f crimea long practised in aecurity, beca.ute nevar
eltp(>sed f What plfldges could I get to aatisfyme, that I, on
whom hEir dependeu01.. must be, would be apared by thoae who, ·I
had reuon to think, were wishing then to aaoriflce me f How
oould I truat thfl helpleaa infant in banda which bad hastened the
baptiiDl of many auobiin order to hurry them iuto the aecret pit
in the cellar f Could auppoae that Father PMw.~ Priut oftM
Pa:ri8A Church oj Montreal, would aee hw oum child growing up
iu the world, and feel willing to run the risk of having the truth
expoled P What could I tli:Jiect, especially from him, but the ut-
moet ranoour1 and the moat determ10ed enmitj, again1t the ilmo•
cent child an<1 ita abuaed and defenceleee mother!'
Yet, my mind would aometimea atill incline to the oppollite di·
rection, and indulge the thought, that perhape the only war to
ecure heaven to ue both, wu to throw ounelvee back into the
hand• of the cbnich, to be treated ulhe pleued.-When, there-
fore, the fear of immediate death wu removed, I renounced all
thoupta of cicmmuuioating the nbatance of the facta of this vo.
lu~e. It happeo,ed, however, that my dan1er wu,not pueed. I

chaplaiDJ bu*, u It wu at a time when euppoMd mrHlf nl ol ·
dupr, .1. had defernd for three dafl my propoud commuDioa-
tioa, thfaking that I might yet a•ota it altogether. Whea mr
eymptpme, bowe•er, beO&me more alarming, I wu ansloa1 for
SatUrday co arrl•e, the day which I bad ap~inted; and when I
had not the opportUDitr, on that day, which I deeired, I thoaaht
it migbt.be too late. I did not 1H him WI Monda)", when mr
proepecte of eunbiog were ~ gloomy, ud I tlieo ioformei :
him that I wiehed to oommanfoate to hfm a few HOrttl, wb\ch ·
wen likely otherwiH to die with me. I then told him, tliatwhite
a nun, in the Oon•eat of Kontreal I bad witnHHd the murder
of a DUD called Saint Fnuoee, and of at leut one of the lnfutl
which I b•e epoken of in thle book. I added eome few circum•
etuCHt_ud I beline dieololed, in general terma, 10me of the
crimea I knew of in that Nunnery. ·
Kr anticipation• of death pro1'ed to be unfounded : for my
health afterward• improl'ed, ud had I not made the oonf.-ione
on that oocaelon, it ie •err po•ible I might nenr have made
them. I, howenr, afterwarde, felt more willing to lieten to in·
r.truction, and experienced friendly attention• from 'lOme of the
benevolent peiebne around me, who, taking £n intereet in me on
aooount of mr darkened undentauding, forni1hed me with the
Bible, and were e.er ready to couneel me when I desired it.
I 100n began to belie1'8 that God might have.intended that hie
creature• ahould learn hie will by reading hi• word, and taking
upon them the free eserci~G of their reaeon, ud acting under re•
eponaibility to him. ,
It ia di.tllcult fol:' ena wi•o he never gil'en way to nob argu.
ment. and inflt'.encca u& tl1oea to which I-had been expoled.- to
realize how han1 it i1 to think aright. after thiuking wrong. The
Scripture• alwafl affect me powerfully when I read them; but I
feel that I ha•e but juet begun to learn the great trutbe, in which
I ought to han baeD early.and thoroujrhl.)' ioatructed. I reatize1
in aome degree, how it ie, that the Scripture• render the people or
the United State• 10 etrongly oppo11d to euch doctrine• a1 are
taught in the Black and Congregational Nunnerie• of Montreat.
Tho prieata and nuna uled often to·declare that of all heretiol, the
children from the United Statu were the molt diJilcult tobeOOD•
nrted; and it wae thought a great triu·
mph when one of them
wa1 brought ol'er to " the true faith.'' The fuet pueage ofScrip.
tore that made any Hriou impreeaion upon mr mind, wu tile
te:a:t on which the chaplain preached on the Sabbath after mr in·

WBD Mr. Moreton retumed home, be related to hl1 Wife the
oonyenation whioh bad taken plaoe between bimHif aad Mr.
VanduHn; layin, Rn~at 1tre11 upon the fact that the latter wu
a member of the Preebyteriaii Church,-than whiob none had a
more inTeterate boatility" toward• the Catholice, or had done more
to ex{'OI& the erron of their doctrines, or the enormity of their
practice•; and, a1 be l&id, it epoke Tolumee in refutation of the
elanden which bad been heaped upon the Catholics, that a Pre..
byteriao 1bould bear eucb testimony u be bad lnme to the ez.
oelJence of the connut school, the oheapneu of ite te~e, and the
abHnoe of intention or effort to proHlyte the children of Protei-
taut parents. Withal, the fact that be wu Hading hie own
daughter to thil eame eoliool, and hie highly reepectable ltandior
u a merchant, forbadtt.the idea of· any ineinoerity, or want of
nftloient intelligence upon the subject. ·
Still Mn. :Moreton wu not oonvlnoed In 1pite of all thl1 array •
of impolio,. teetimony;, and, while her haeband ~ently inlinuat.
ed that ehe wu Tery ooatinate in her pl'\liudioea, she oonld not
wholly rid her mind of appreheneion, or be brought to beUne
that there wu no real danger incurred ,in eending .Tulia· to a
Catholic echool. · - .
But finding that it wa1 ueeleu to argue the matter any farther
with :Mr. Moreton, abe reluctantlf yielded the point; hoping that
ehe might be able to fortify Julia 1 mind 10 strongly again•& the
wile• and 10phiatry of a crafty prieathood, 10that ebe might lde-
ly paas the fiery ordelll which abe fully belieYed wu about to be
placed before her child ; and when, in the following spring, the
time bed for the departure of Julia with her father for the oon.
'f'ent ~ehool, arrived ; and the Tebiole whicli bore them away, n•
ceded from her Yiew ebe returned from the 1treet door into her
litting room, with a hea"l heart; feeling ae though a dark cloud,
eurohusted with evil, \lal gathered onr benelf and family.
Oo hie nturn, after ba'f'ing placed .Tulia at ecbool, hit wife had
a tbouUDd on:doue question• to be anawered ; all of which he
auwerel 10 readiiJ, and with 1uch ..pparent ·~·ala~t to hhn· ·

greateat kiodnea, and throwing Jler uma around Juli... ldllecl •
her affectionately, welcou.lag hor to thelnatitutioo, and promi..
ing to be a mother to her, while abe continued there; that .Julia
had found one or two old acquaintanoe1 among the pupile, and
188med to be utiefied ; and that, on hie ezpreuing a wieb that
hie daughteJ:'• principlee e\ould la ~ ••1be interfered with,lhe
assured him, in the moat frank and positive manner, that he need
11o.t entertain auy fe&rl on that eubject,'aa they bad no deiire to

• "Inebori,' ' added Kr. Moreton, u ehe il oneof the QaOJt &~ree­

Five montha puled away, and the summer 'f&O&tioa came on.
)(r• .l(oreton and hil le.dy had atteo4ed the eumination ; and,
although Julia'• pro~ did not meet their ezpeotation, 7•theJ
suppo.ed that thl1 m•ght be attributed to the novelty of the pod•

for him an intrigue with a young and bandaome nun in the coo-

was one of the converts from Proteatantiam, made out of the fa·
mily of boarding pupils. This intrigue abe•did not beaikte to
