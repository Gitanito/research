 With the issue of May 28, 1859, the journal appeared as The Two Worlds or, Weekly Evangelist, with a stronger Christian evangelical tone, and that issue may have been the last published.  Horsell (1807-1863) was a proselytizing vegetarian and was already the publisher of many early books on spiritualism, and also of Kenneth R.H. Mackenzie's Biological Review and the Spiritual Messenger, when he started this general-circulation journal.  His imprint also appears on the first English edition of Whitman's Leaves of Grass (1855).  Horsell welcomed spiritualism from the beginning and, as James Gregory has discovered, published several notable articles on it in this journal, including "a note on 'the Black Art in Somerset' (7 October 1858), an account of a seance (at the home of H. Whitaker, of 31, Newman Street), with Mrs Marshall and her niece (14 October 1858), Jacob Dixon on clairvoyant perception (14 October 1858), William Carpenter on mesmeric experiences (14 October 1858) and spiritualism (22 January 1859), a ghost story and note on the Hoxton Spiritualist Society (29 Jan 1859)."

It was devoted to homeopathy, hydropathy, spiritualism, abstinence and teetotalism, and included, as was customary in the period, a serialized "Romance of Real Life."
