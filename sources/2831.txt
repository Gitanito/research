Verbatim Record of a Lecture delivered in Aeolian
Hall, New York City in course of tlie American Tour.
By the Medium in his normal state:
T W O U LD ask you please to enter into the Silence of Divine
Aspiration called Prayer. In that Silence I would ask each of
you to give the fullest expression of your spiritual self, in real
and intense earnestness, that in the measure that you give so
shall you receive . . .
0, Divine First Cause, our Father and our Mother God,
Thou Who art in the centre of Cosmic Harmonies, may we, Thine
embodied children, enter so completely into harmony with the
Higher and Holier Planes of Existence and Consciousness that
we may recognize our being vessels for the in-flowing and out­
pouring of Thy Divine Inspiration to the end of uplifting and
delivering all darkened states of humanity in the world to-day.
May Thy servant, the instrument, be found passive and unresist­
ing in his collaboration with one disembodied whom we have
come to know and love as MOON T R A IL and may the Great
Message come on tidal waves of Divine Power to the end of all
hungering souls being appeased and doubting hearts strength­
ened, We ask it all in the name of humanity for Love’s unsullied
sake, Amen.
By MOON TRAIL, through his entranced medium,
Horace S. Hamhling:
Not with vain tears, when you’re beyond the sun
You’ll beat on the substantial doors, nor tread
Those dusty highroads with the aimless dead
Plaintive for earth. But rather turn and run
Down some close-covered by-way of the air;
Some low, sweet alley between wind and wind,
Stoop under faint gleams, thread the shadows, find
Some whispering, ghost-forgotten nook,
And there . . .
Spend in pure converse th’etemal day.
Think each in each immediately wise.
Learn all you lacked before. Hear, know, and say
All your tumultous body now denies.
And feel, who have laid your groping hands away,
And see, no longer blinded by your eyes.
■ THE AIMLESS DEAD
Yes, friends of earth, you shall feel and you shall see when
nq longer you encourage the aimlessness of the aimless dead
plaintive for earth. B y freeing yourselves to rise into the con­
sciousness of your latent spirituality you could the better go to
your beloved dead in place of dragging them down to you to
satisfy your personal whims.
Come up to us L Come, clasp our hands 1 Come, share in the
moulding of a new and more vital race-consciousness that men
m ay■be spiritualised and heaven established on earth! Come,
join the heavenly battalions!
Battalions of the heavenly siege
Encircling earth, above, below.
How did you leave your homes of bliss
To-ypme on service such as this?
To seek a kingdom for ypur liege?

W€T1
sS@ of-*Bten takSrheart anew,
We lift?5ur eyes and shout amain,
We fling youx.slogan back again,
“YoirShall not^feign without us men!
“Lead! Valiant Christ! We’ll follow You!
“Together we on earth shall reign Vfy ]
Yes, again we’ll follow the Valiant Christ wherever on earth
his reign once led, and in the Light of H is Ray and the warmth
of H is understanding establish the Divine Principle called Christ-
hcod on earth once mere. We are coming from sphere upon
sphere of Higher Consciousness, dear children of earth, to stay
your hands from unholy deeds and make you aware of perpetual
God-consciousness.
We, comrades of yours on the everlasting quest for Truth,
painfully recognise your floundering, your loneliness and baffling
bewilderment in the realm of stark and cold intellectuality, and,
fo'- that reason, come to guide you by whispering encouragement.
Whispering encouragement: not dictatorial or authoritarian dog­
ma. We are not asking you to accept what we say or consider
our words as final authority just because we are removed one
tiny step higher in the ladder of progress. But we do expect
THE AIMLESS DEAD 5
you to listen— to listen with the soul’s inner ear, for that alone
can recognise Basic Truth, and then, on its journey from the inner
to the outer, our message may be sifted through your God-given
reason ere intellectual pros and cons, prejudices and preconceived
ideas, entangle and obscure it.
From time to time men have come to teach in terms called
intellectual, yet, with the full and unfettered expression of intel­
lect and much-vaunted learning, whither have you been led? Has
hate, and lust, and greed, and pain, and ugliness, and intolerance
been vanquished from your earth by the much-prized power of
intellect? When the most besotted and craven wretch suddenly
manifests a spark of divine love, as frequently he will, would
you say intellect had been the motive force? What think you
really of civilisation— the most monumental product of intellect?
What, in comparison, think you of the little minds with big
hearts, the unlearned yet magnanimous who, in all ages, have
really been the pivots around which real movement has been
maintained?
Viewing your mechanical age— product of mechanical intel-2
lect— we observe you repeating the tragedy of the crucifixion of
Christ every day that you listen with merely physical ears and
are unaware of a soul-consciousness more vital than brains and
intellect. Few, very few, of you comprehend the operation of
Cosmic Law. We desire to make you aware of this operation,
yet cannot find a better technique than was given you in the
words of the Nazarene: “Except ye become as a little child, ye
can in nowise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.” Did a child
manifest intellect it would cease to be a child. ’Tis true to say
that a child without intellect is childish, but it is truer to say
that a child without soul is puerile. When the soul of a child
forms the foundation of its intellect then is the quality truly
childlike. To be childlike and not childish is the key-note of
finding God. We would that you would say: “0, let me for ever
forget and blot from my vision the ceaseless procession of false
doctrinaires who din their isms and anities into my tired heart.
Let me become a child who trusts its parents— trusts implicitly
the wisdom, and the love, and the beneficence, then shall I be
able to say, ‘All is divinely well with me, and I have found
my God’ ”.
We strive to define God as a Principle rather than a Person
when called upon to do so— but the definition of God is really the
province of theologians. What kind of a job they have made of
their self-appointed task we leave you to judge. Of one thing
we are well aware: their theology is far from being child-like.
You are children of the New Day and Age, the Spiritual
Dawn, the Twentieth Century as you measure time. Your New
World progeniture came from a dissatisfied Old World. The
dissatisfaction and restlessness and discontent began in religion’s
narrow orbit. Religious intolerance drove your ancestors out.
It should, therefore, not be difficult for you to free the world
from its shackles of limitation in religious directions. You have
all witnessed the spectacle of decaying religions, on the other
6 THE AIMLESS DEAD
hand you have also seen the unmistakable signs of men and
women consciously expressing their at-one-ment with God. The
pity is that some of them try to limit their glorious discovery
within a fixed principle or principles. For this reason it is Moon
Trail's desire never to give a name to his method of teaching.
Verily would it seem that the time has now come when we
must make you vitally conscious of the fact that this school-house
of life in physical realms, with its trials and disillusionments,
needs balancing . . .
So small this world, so vast its agonies,
A future life is needed to adjust
Those ill-proportioned, wide discrepancies
Between the spirit and its frame of dust.
So whej^my?scmP^i^thfis in some new-found grief,
And all my heart-strings tremble at the strain,
M y reason lencfehew courage to belief
And all God’s hidden purposes seem plain.
We, your consciously surviving comrades in the March to-
Sfivards The Light, sorrow because earth, to you, is the ultimate.
®\®ffwould forgive you did you but strive even to make it the
pepultimate, but even that i^jputwith the consciousness of the
* and be rnfirro, fg$ tomorrow we die” attitude of most
Rjffiyou. There is a measure of intellectual dishonesty about this
"^ttitude,jgyh|aMS intense- earnestness in solving Life’s Plan is
E a S s s a r y Slsbu would avoid regarding God as merely whimsical,
■ijfou .fciowfGod j5yes^Mjtt,~yet you think of H is punishing you.
ThuSyou make Him guilty St masochism. We marvel that your
FJpPf does not lead you ta=see . . .
This world is a vaporous jest at best
Tbssfid off by the gods in laughter;
And a cruel attempt at wit were it
If nothiigt better came after.
Perhaps the greatest difficulty with which we are confronted
Krom our side of life -is to convince what is known as “reasonable
Sften” that they have $'$oul. If Moots-Trail were to define soul
to you he would enter the lists against other intellectual duellists
gwho must needs feed on the formula of words. Yet can we say
apat soul can well be likened to the hoping, dreaming, idealising
of fepu that ceaselessly urges you to become something better
Kbmorrow than you were to-day, something better to-day than
Rbu were yesterday.
We see your individual souls as shining drops from the soul-
,pil6l called God, or Good. And there is a drop of good in each
you, is there not? The merely physical scientists will plod
ftjearily, yet joyfully, through thesis after thesis, formulated
from oxpirement after experiment, on the outer periphery of the
circle which they pride themselves in calling the ponderable,
measurable, classifiable, analysable physical facts, until . .. until
unconsciously swerving to the inner, they become confronted
a^ith the great and awe-inspiring predominant fact of L IF E !
THE AIMLESS DEAD 7
It surely is not too difficult for them to postulate this L IF E as
Being, and Being as God? What else can be God? Those who
demand a last-analysis definition of everything should demand
a last-analysis definition of L IF E from the unknown all-knowing
physical scientists! Limited man on earth must not, dare not
limit the illimitable God to merely physical intellectual terms or
conceptions. The telescope is growing to comprehend the stars.
The stars have never agreed to deflate to the compass of the
telescope . . .
And never yet a star went out
So why should you men fear or doubt?
Cosmic Law— the God-Consciousness made manifest— mani­
fests in two ways: the negative and the positive. Negative Law
seems to us to be almost completely absorbed in its expression
by your earth-lives; seems to belong almost exclusively to the
physical realm, which, of itself, is a negative realm of expression.
The real difficulty of you earth-children, then, is to maintain a
balance between negativity and positivity; between your earthy
envelope, the body, and your real self, the spirit.
Your journey through earth-life might be likened to an
uncertain adherence to the middle of a road one side of which is
shady and the other side sunny. Recognising the unsatisfactory
middle, you swerve constantly to the shady side, claiming that
it is more restful, cooler and less exacting on that side. We are
travelling that same road, and, be it noted, in the self-same
direction as yourselves, but it is ever the sunny side to which we
keep. Quite aware that it will involve you in a little more effort
and labour to cross to the sunny side, yet do we strive to call you
to that side. The negative is easy, the positive hard. And if you
stay in negative vibrations long enough you will imprison your­
selves, and that prison on the shady side is well-night impreg­
nable. It is to save you from such imprisonment that we jour­
ney back to earth.
Yes, earth and all that belongs to it is involved in negative
vibrations preponderating all the time. But even earth is passing
away. Your physical scientists can prove that. To free your­
selves from negativity yours is the fight— and yours is the rich
reward. Can you obtain guidance to the freeing? Yes.
A Light, than the light of human reason far greater alone,
And a Voice, than the Voice of one poor creed far clearer alone,
Shineth and speaketh ever.
Yes, that Light it ever shineth and
That Voice it ever speaketh,
Speaketh, shineth, unobtrusive yet benign
’Midst the feud of mortal millions!
Darkness sees its ultimate expression in its opposite polaric
pull, the Light. Weakness is ever marching towards its positive
counterpart, Strength. All imperfections are confronted with
ultimate perfections. Sickness will become Health and Wrong
will become Right. You, poor, bruised children of earth are
8 THE AIMLESS DEAD
caught up in the surging tide of the polaric pull between nega­
tivity and positivity— material scientists call that moving tide
Evolution. You, of your own volition, can swing into the positive
tide as often as you determine, and thus speed on Divine Plan.
Your innate and inherent God-power can mightily embrace every
negative and convert it into a positive if you will it.
So many of you here to-night instinctively feel that all this
is true. Few of you will assert that what we have been saying
is other than what you have always known inwardly, “I have
always felt something like this deep down within me, Moon
Trail,” iswvhat we frequently are told. The God in Moon Trail
is talking to the God in you. That is the simple explanation.
Reality always recognises Reality. Sincerity responds to Sin­
cerity. Truth sympathetically vibrates to Truth. God always
knows God. Quite a 'few of you will want to tell us that it does
not wholly accord with your Methodist, Roman Catholic, Wes­
leyan, "or Episcopal training. Our reply is, it oughtpto. If it
does not then the fault does not lie with L}S§ If Truth hurts, it
Is n ’t Truth’s faults! If it is too indigestible for you and you
must vomit, as so many who fret and fume would seem to be
doing, then you had better strengthen your digestions for we
shall return again and again proffering the same dish, saying
in effejt7"as does;j®ur Bible:
“Take it and eat it up, and it shall be bitter in
thy bel|y; but in thy mouth sweet as honey”.
,, Even the negative— take it, eat it up. B y your God-power
it will thus be converted into a positive. Do not run away from
it. The p rists telk-you to shun sinP How can you? You can, at
the worst run away from it Or shut yourselves in cloistered seclu­
sion from 3r, but you are disloyal to God in this way, you are
not doing your job which“ s to clean lip all dirt and establish
Heaven on Earth.
A t this jfHfiJture we gather a questioning vibration from a
member of our audjlsEe, The earth-child is mentally asking
“Where is this spffjt world from which Moon Trail journeys
forth so magnanimously?”' The brief answer is— everywhere
and nowhere. Within spirit consciousness there is neither space
nor time, but there is a fourth dimension— a vibrational-con­
sciousness. Your poetess was not very far wrong when she sang:
I sometimes think that but for our veiled eyes
We should find heaven right round about us lies.
When your earth-body, at so-called death, is laid back into
the elements from which it is compounded, the real you is set
free. That real you is the character-personality-ego you. The
real you immediately becomes conscious of its survival, becomes
aware, that is, of an enhanced or heightened vibration. In its
journey from earth to heaven (to use your phraseology) it has
used neither time nor space. Geographically the soul is situated,
after death, just precisely where it was before death. Perhaps
the greatest change which has befallen the freed soul is its vibra­
THE AIMLESS DEAD 9
tional awareness; it is batter able to “sense” varying vibrations,
such as, beneath it, the earth, above it, the inner spheres of
Divine Wisdom. Quite vast hordes accept the gift from God of,
this vibrational awareness, but still remain enmeshed in earth
vibrations, reluctant, as it were, to expend effort in rising higher
— they are sort of earthbound. So unwilling to free themselves
are these spirits that they continue to minister to the demoral­
ising earth-people who dabble in mere psychism; they dabbiaZ
with them and some poor fools call their dabbling “evidence of
survival”. We suppose it is. Evidence vouchsafed by the “aim­
less dead plaintive for earth”. The best evidence of survival is
possessed by every earth-child and has always been so possessed
from time’s beginning— IN T H E SO U L IT S E L F — the elements
of which know themselves to be indestructible. Some day even
psychic researchers will learn! But only when they begin at the
centre and work to the periphery, not, as is now the case,
vice versa.
“The aimless dead” would cease to be aimless did they utilise
the higher vibrations to call— every time they contact you— to
you in the words heard by St. John. “Come up higher! Come up
higher!” When you rise into spiritual vibrations then is spirit
communication wholly holy. When you drag down the sp irits
to earth to satisfy your demands for “physical" evidence then
you pathetically demonstrate the fact that you cannot discrimi­
nate between the false and the real, the meretricious and the
meritorious. We have said nothing of those selfless souls who,
tied to you by ties of kinship, come back of their own free will
to guide and comfort you.
Your earth lives largely consist of a succession of problems.
To solve them is to take pride in your strength and power. To
be baffled by them is to develop a sense of futility about the
whole of life. Yet never need a problem of yours go unsolved.
He who sets a problem always knows its real solution. If God
sets the problem, God knows the solution beforehand. Why not,
then, let God, the God in you, solve all of your problems before­
hand? Leave it to God! That, we believe was the subject-title
which was chosen this evening, but, to draw your attention
away from the merely psychic to the intensely spiritual we have
talked of the aimless dead. These cannot solve your problems.
Leave it to God!
But, to be very sure that God is collaborating with you in the
solution of your problems, you must have Samuel’s ear and thine
eye must be single that thine whole body shall be full of light.
You must cultivate spontaneous adaptability for what is wrong
to you to-day may not be wrong tomorrow. Adaptability. That
sounds the keynote for discrimination between right and wrong,
negative and positive. Adaptability to adjust yourself quickly,
cheerfully, willingly, courageously, calmly and peacefully to God’s
everchanging changes; to the movement and the rhythm of Cos­
mos. What is this rhythm of Cosmos? If the tide is flowing
now, it soon will ebb. If the winter is with you now, the summer
yet will come. If night is enfolding you now, day follows surely.
4 THE AIMLESS DEAD
Yes, friends of earth, you shall feel and you shall see when
no longer you encourage the aimlessness of the aimless dead
plaintive for earth. By freeing yourselves to rise into the con­
sciousness of your latent spirituality you could the better go to
your beloved dead in place of dragging them down to you to
satisfy your personal whims.
Come up to us! Come, clasp our hands! Come, share in the
moulding of a new and more vital race-consciousness that men
may be spiritualised and heaven established on earth! Come,
join the heavenly battalions!
Battalions of the heavenly siege

How did you leave your homes of bliss
To come on service such as this?

must make you vitally conscious of the fact that this school-house
of life in physical realms, with its trials and disillusionments,
needs balancing . . .
So small this world, so vast its agonies,
A future life is needed to adjust
Those ill-proportioned, wide discrepancies
Between the spirit and its frame of dust.
So when my soul writhes in some new-found grief,
And all my heart-strings tremble at the strain,
My reason lends new courage to belief
And all God’s hidden purposes seem plain.
We, your consciously surviving comrades in the March to­
wards The Light, sorrow because earth, to you, is the ultimate.
We would forgive you did you but strive even to make it the
penultimate, but even that is cutwith the consciousness of the
*?‘eat,-drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die” attitude of most
of you. There is a measure of intellectual dishonesty about this
attitude, whereas intense earnestness in solving Life’s Plan is
necessary would avoid regarding God as merely whimsical.
You knowi'God loves you, yet you think of His punishing you.
Thus you make Him guilty of masochism. We marvel that your
logic does not lead you to see . . .
This world is a vaporous jest at best
Tossed off by the gods in laughter;
And a cruel attempt at wit were it
If nothing better came after.
Perhaps the greatest difficulty with which we are confronted
from our side of life is to convince what is known as “reasonable
men” that they have a soul. If Moon Trail were to define soul
to you he would enter the lists against other intellectual duellists
who must needs feed on the formula of words. Yet can we say
that soul can well be likened to the hoping, dreaming, idealising
part of you that ceaselessly urges you to become something better
tomorrow than you were to-day, something better to-day than
you were yesterday.
We see your individual souls as shining drops from the soul-
pcol called God, or Good. And there is a drop of good in each
of you, is there not? The merely physical scientists will plod
wearily, yet joyfully, through thesis after thesis, formulated
from expirement after experiment, on the outer periphery of the
circle which they pride themselves in calling the ponderable,
measurable, classifiable, analysable physical facts, until. . . until
unconsciously swerving to the inner, they become confronted
with the great and awe-inspiring predominant fact of LIFE!
TIIE AIMLESS DEAD
It surely is not too difficult for them to postulate this LIFE as
Being, and Being as God? What else can be God? Those who
demand a last-analysis definition of everything should demand
a last-analysis definition of LIFE from the unknown all-knowing
physical scientists! Limited man on earth must not, dare not
limit the illimitable God to merely physical intellectual terms or
conceptions. The telescope is growing to comprehend the stars.
The stars have never agreed to deflate to the compass of the
telescope . . .
And never yet a star went out
So why should you men fear or doubt?
Cosmic Law—the God-Consciousness made manifest—mani­
fests in two ways: the negative and the positive. Negative Law
seems to us to be almost completely absorbed in its expression
by your earth-lives; seems to belong almost exclusively to the
physical realm, which, of itself, is a negative realm of expression.
The real difficulty of you earth-children, then, is to maintain a
balance between negativity and positivity; between your earthy
envelope, the body, and your real self, the spirit.
Your journey through earth-life might be likened to an
uncertain adherence to the middle of a road one side of which is
shady and the other side sunny. Recognising the unsatisfactory
middle, you swerve constantly to the shady side, claiming that
it is more restful, cooler and less exacting on that side. We are
travelling that same road, and, be it noted, in the self-same
direction as yourselves, but it is ever the sunny side to which we
keep. Quite aware that it will involve you in a little more effort
and labour to cross to the sunny side, yet do we strive to call you
to that side. The negative is easy, the positive hard. And if you
stay in negative vibrations long enough you will imprison your­
selves, and that prison on the shady side is well-night impreg­
nable. It is to save you from such imprisonment that we jour­
ney back to earth.
Yes, earth and all that belongs to it is involved in negative
vibrations preponderating all the time. But even earth is passing
away. Your physical scientists can prove that. To free your­
selves from negativity yours is the fight—and yours is the rich
reward. Can you obtain guidance to the freeing? Yes.
A Light, than the light of human reason far greater alone,
And a Voice, than the Voice of one poor creed far clearer alone,
Shineth and speaketh ever.
Yes, that Light it ever shineth and
That Voice it ever speaketh,
Speaketh, shineth, unobtrusive yet benign
’Midst the feud of mortal millions!
Darkness sees its ultimate expression in its opposite polaric
pull, the Light. Weakness is ever marching towards its positive
counterpart, Strength. All imperfections are confronted with
ultimate perfections. Sickness will become Health and Wrong
will become Right. You, poor, bruised children of earth are
8 THE AIMLESS DEAD
caught up in the surging tide of the polaric pull between nega­
tivity and positivity—material scientists call that moving tide
Evolution. You, of your own volition, can swing into the positive
tide as often as you determine, and thus speed on Divine Plan.
Your innate and inherent God-power can mightily embrace every
negative and convert it into a positive if you will it.
So many of you here to-night instinctively feel that all this
is true. Few of you will assert that what we have been saying
is other than what you have always known inwardly. “I have
always felt something like this deep down within me, Moon
Trail,” is what we frequently are told. The God in Moon Trail
is talking to the God in you. That is the simple explanation.
Reality always recognises Reality. Sincerity responds to Sin­
cerity. Truth sympathetically vibrates to Truth. God always
knows God. Quite a few of you will want to tell us that it does
not wholly accord with your Methodist, Roman Catholic, Wes­
leyan, or Episcopal training. Our reply is, it ought to. If it
does not then the fault does not lie with us . If Truth hurts, it
isn’t Truth’s fault. E f it is too indigestible for you and you
must vomit, as so many who fret and fume would seem to be
doing, then you had better strengthen your digestions for we
shall return again and again proffering the same dish, saying
in effect, as does your Bible:
“Take it and eat it up, and it shall be bitter in
thy belly, but in thy mouth sweet as honey”.
Even the negative—take it, eat it up. By your God-power
it will thus be converted into a positive. Do not run. away from
it. The priests tell you to shun sin. How can you? You can, at
the worst run away from it or shut yourselves in cloistered seclu­
sion from it, but you are disloyal to God in this way, you are
not doing your job which is to clean up all dirt and establish
Heaven on Earth.
At this juncture we gather a questioning vibration from a
member of our audience. The earth-child is mentally asking
“Where is this spirit world from which Moon Trail journeys
forth so magnanimously?” The brief answer is—everywhere
and nowhere. Within spirit consciousness there is neither space
nor time, but there is a fourth dimension—a vibrational-con­
sciousness. Your poetess was not very far wrong when she sang:
I sometimes think that but for our veiled eyes
We should find heaven right round about us lies.
When your earth-body, at so-called death, is laid back into
the elements from which it is compounded, the real you is set
free. That real you is the character-personality-ego you. The
real you immediately becomes conscious of its survival, becomes
aware, that is, of an enhanced or heightened vibration. In its
journey from earth to heaven (to use your phraseology) it has
used neither time nor space. Geographically the soul is situated,
after death, just precisely where it was before death. Perhaps
the greatest change which has befallen the freed soul is its vibra­
THE AIMLESS DEAD 9
tional awareness; it is better able to “sense” varying vibrations,
such as, beneath it, the earth, above it, the inner spheres of
Divine Wisdom. Quite vast hordes accept the gift from God of
this vibrational awareness, but still remain enmeshed in earth
vibrations, reluctant, as it were, to expend effort in rising higher
—they are sort of earthbound. So unwilling to free themselves
are these spirits that they continue to minister to the demoral­
ising earth-people who dabble in mere psychism; they dabble
with them and some poor fools call their dabbling “evidence of
survival”. We suppose it is. Evidence vouchsafed by the “aim­
less dead plaintive for earth”. The best evidence of survival is
possessed by every earth-child and has always been so possessed
from time’s beginning—IN THE SOUL ITSELF—the elements
of which know themselves to be indestructible. Some day even
psychic researchers will learn 1 But only when they begin at the
centre and work to the periphery, not, as is now the case,
vice versa.
“The aimless dead” would cease to be aimless did they utilise
the higher vibrations to call—every time they contact you—to
you in the words heard by St. John. “Come up higher! Come up
higher!” When you rise into spiritual vibrations then is spirit
communication wholly holy. When you drag down the spirits
to earth to satisfy your demands for “physical” evidence then
you pathetically demonstrate the fact that you cannot discrimi­
nate between the false and the real, the meretricious and the
meritorious. We have said nothing of those selfless souls who,
tied to you by ties of kinship, come back of their own free will
to guide and comfort you.
Your earth lives largely consist of a succession of problems.
To solve them is to take pride in your strength and power. To
be baffled by them is to develop a sense of futility about the
whole of life. Yet never need a problem of yours go unsolved.
He who sets a problem always knows its real solution. If God
sets the problem, God knows the solution beforehand. Why not,
then, let God, the God in you, solve all of your problems before-
h an d ? Leave it to God! That, we believe was the subject-title
which was chosen this evening, but, to draw your attention
away from the merely psychic to the intensely spiritual we have
talked of the aimless dead. These cannot solve your problems.
Leave it to God!
But, to be very sure that God is collaborating with you in the
solution of your problems, you must have Samuel’s ear and thine
eye must be single that thine whole body shall be full of light.
You must cultivate spontaneous adaptability for what is wrong
to you to-day may not be wrong tomorrow. Adaptability. That
sounds the keynote for discrimination between right and wrong,
negative and positive. Adaptability to adjust yourself quickly,
cheerfully, willingly, courageously, calmly and peacefully to God’
s
everchanging changes; to the movement and the rhythm of Cos­
mos. What is this rhythm of Cosmos? If the tide is flowing
now, it soon will ebb. If the winter is with you now, the summer
yet will come. If night is enfolding you now, day follows surely.
10 THE AIMLESS DEAD
If sickness be your sad lot now, health is a little way ahead.
Rhythm. Rhythm of Cosmos. Adaptability to that rhythm is
your key to progress? To make yourself fluidic and not static.
To be ready ever to let go and not fix things. How dare you fix
your wants and desires in an ever-changing universe that flows to
change and newness all the time? Live, love, let be. That is
Moon Trail’s motto for you. The rhythm of Cosmos flows, moves,
breathes, beats, pulses, oscillates, swings and lives—LIVES!—
THERE IS NO DEATH!
If you are trying to be the one fixed pebble on the beach
whilst all the other pebbles are moving with the inflow and out­
flow of the moving, caressing waves, you will be knocked and
bruised. Move!Live!Live with the life where death is unknown!
Desiring to set you on the road of progress immediately,
we would ask that you listen for Divine Command to-night, and
begin to move and live and breathe and work with God tomorrow.
Cosmic Law will reveal itself to you in the measure of the sin­
cerity of your approach to it. As you live it you will love it, and
you will love it because you live it. Better than anything you
have ever known before is this LIVING in harmony with Cosmos
—feeling yourself linked to suns, and worlds, and nebulae, and
star-dust, and the limitless, vast universe in its pulsing rhythm.
Of course,-you need not learn this obedience to Cosmic law
. . . y et. . .®eugh ultimately you must, but you cannot break it.
God’s laws cannot be broken. And there really is no hurry about
your learning this obedience. God is in no hurry, in spite of the
fear-instilling teachings of the piaSsts who would warn you to
huifir ere death tells you it is too late. Procrastination, though,
is the thief of spiritual peace.
JEfchildren of earth fjIThis teaching is workable—everywhere
—affall times—this moving with God’s turning wheel of Divine
Unfoldment—this establishing of God’s Kingdom on Earth—this
living in Harmony with God. It needs your becoming so imper­
sonal and selfless that you will recognise the impersonality of
The Scheme and fit yourself into it.
No man is barred. No one is favoured—be he dignitary
or common man—all, all can move with the wheel. Happiness
is your ultimate goal. God gives you that. But to live is to be
happy. Live every inch of movement of that Moving Wheel of
Life. And with that vibration there draws nigh unto us the
presence of one who has lately passed to our side of life, one who,
released from his bodily limitations into our higher state of
consciousness, has aptly phrased, in poetic form, the living of a
life to the full—the moving with the wheel all the way. He dic­
tates it to us and agrees that we can amend the last lines to
apply to the deeper Cosmic meaning of living.*
If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
THE AIMLESS DEAD 11
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated don’t give way to hating,
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them ‘Hold on!’
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you.
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
Yours is a LIFE and everything that’s in it.
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
MOON TRAIL was evidently referring here to Rudyard Kipling whose
famous poem, “IF,” he proceeded to quote. The alteration of the original
word “earth” to “LIFE” is understandable from the spiritual standpoint
but the publishers do not presume to be effecting any improvement upon
Kipling’s magnificient work. Kipling’s transition to the Higher Life
took place about eight weeks prior to this lecture by MOON TRAIL.
