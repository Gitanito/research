I started to feel too hot, much too hot.  Then I started seeing colors instead of my normal vision. I felt that I was leaning against the wall behind me, and then was sliding down to the ground. I lost consciousness. 
 
  I had an experience that I wouldn't have shared here if it didn't resemble an NDE.   While I was still aware, my sight was replaced by moving colors.  In the middle of the moving colors, it looked like there was an opening.  I could see something like domes, half spheres situated at the ground, which consisted of many glass triangles placed side by side. There were two of these domes. It was as if my vision was only 10% of my normal vision and only in the center of my normal vision. I felt really well, as if I was sleeping and really relaxed. < br> 
 Then I regained consciousness very fast. I was sitting on the floor, with my knees folded in front of me.  My lover was shaking me and called me by my first name.  He was terrified. I was still very relaxed, and didn't have the impression that there might be any problems. I told him immediately 'I saw domes' while he was still asking me if I was conscious. Then I started to feel cold and started feeling bad.  I got out of the shower from there, had terrible nausea, and vomited. Then I remained there, at least five full minutes.  I wasn't moving and was trying to get warmer. I got dressed.  Then I had to go to toilet, suddenly I had diarrhea, nothing else after that.  I rested for the rest of the evening in a state of tiredness and fragility. 
 
 I noticed that another NDEr reported something similar to  mine:  â€˜a rounded structure whose surface was made of multiple facets in the shape of triangles.  I was wondering of what material they consisted as I touched one.  It had an aspect of glass, was warmer and softer than glass, even though it had its transparency.'  Murielle T NDE

Background Information:

Gender:	 Female

Date NDE Occurred:	  hiver 2010

  NDE Elements:

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Uncertain         Malaise. J'étais avec mon amant dans une douche mal aérée, et me suis évanouie pour quelques instant  Illness, trauma or other condition not considered life threatening   I fainted; as no doctor could do a diagnosis at the spot, I don't know to what extent it was serious. I was in the shower. My vision was progressively replaced by colors, and I felt myself leaning against the wall behind me, and sliding down to the ground. Then I completely lost consciousness for about ten or so seconds.  I had a kind of dream in that moment. Then I felt very cold, vomited and had diarrhea. I was fine after that. I was together with my lover in a badly ventilated shower, and fainted for a few moments.

How do you consider the content of your experience?      Entirely pleasant

Did you feel separated from your body?    No    I lost awareness of my body

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?      Less consciousness and alertness than normal   I really had the impression to start a dream, with what I saw intermingling with colors. On the other hand, it is rather unusual that I have a reduced vision of this kind while dreaming.

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?       The experienced seemed more like the beginning of a dream.

Were your thoughts speeded up?       No

The experience included:       A landscape or city

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?       Some unfamiliar and strange place     I didn't understand it. You could say it was a dream, but with a very different texture from my usual dreams. The place didnâ€™t resemble anything I knew. Half spheres, quite big, difficult to estimate their height, consisting of multiple glass triangles put side by side. I had the strong feeling that the place was existing, but somewhere else. A known place. Or at least, that it was an important place.

What emotions did you feel during the experience?       Absolutely none. Peace of mind.

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?       Relief or calmness

Were you compassionate after your experience?       Moderately compassionate toward others

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?       No changes in my life     I lately met a person who experienced an NDE, who spiritually appeased me enormously, and validated beliefs that I kept in the state of 'Cartesian doubt'.

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?        No   

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      No

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?     I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.    I remember more clearly the place I 'dreamed' of, than the place where I was.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       Uncertain     I always had faculties out of the ordinary, success at school, empathy and sensitivity, oscillating between hypersensitivity, rather sharp sensory perceptions, or a hyper-emotionalism in the worst case.

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        When waking up I was really perplexed, and had the strong feeling that I saw something important, that I didn't understand.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    Immediately after the experience I told it to my lover, who was with me and very worried. He had no reaction, seemingly rather worried about my health, and taking this like an indication of the seriousness of my fainting. Later on I told it to my next boyfriend, who was listening with interest.

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     No

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was probably not real      I was certain that it was but a dream, mainly due to the reaction of my lover, by imitation. Yet now I remember that at the moment, the vision marked me.

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was probably not real      I don't think that it was real in the sense that I don't think that my eyes 'saw' what I 'saw'. I don't think that the experience was part of the reality, as we know it here by living it.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       I was outside of the domes. I don't remember the ground. I believe that the sky was blue, quite relaxed. There was an atmosphere of calm, of a serene void, but as if I was feeling a quite important activity, an important role, in or beyond the domes. The atmosphere was strange, one could say a bit like a video game, an uncluttered set of the scene, but strangely modern, or futuristic. I already felt similar sensations when playing some car race games. Some kind of scenic design.
