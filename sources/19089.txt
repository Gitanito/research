you
sure I worked at Boeing aircraft
each California and as a surface
technician working for the commercial
side and military side of Boeing and
Long Beach California formally McDonnell
Douglas Aircraft Company and I became
interview interested in ham radio about
1980 and I got my ham radio license and
in 1987 I was scanning my ham radio of
the frequency down and it came across a
conversation two people were in
conversation one in El Toro and one in
Newport Beach and they were talking
about bombers and fighters and the other
person that was living where actually
there were three people wanted Toluca
Lake which we are close to right now and
he was continuing to call him general
and you don&#39;t do that on ham radio on CB
radio you do that if they&#39;re called
handles and so I waited for them to
clear out and then went back to the
gentleman and Toluca Lake and asked him
why he was calling this person in
Newport Beach general and he told me
that you would talk to me about that off
the air in which I had then gave him my
phone number and at the time I was in
Signal Hill I told him to give me 30
minutes to get home and to call me and
what she did and he called me and he
informed me that but the reason why he
was referring to the person in Newport
Beach as general is because he was a
general and this was four-star general
and chief of staff of the Air Force
general Curtis LeMay
I proceeded to monitor the frequency for
about two weeks I waited for the right
time to come in and break in and I
talked to Curtis LeMay on the air I took
it upon myself to drive down there I
looked up his address using the data FCC
database in Long Beach drove down to
Newport Beach and rang his doorbell
electronic security gate and his wife
Helen let me in and I I was looking for
the doorknob and I couldn&#39;t find one
because they didn&#39;t have a doorknob and
so I just grabbed the gate and went in
and as soon as I walked in the front
door there was a big bust of curtis
lemay depicting him a chief chief of
staff to the Air Force and I&#39;d blew me
away right there and then I knew this
was Curtis LeMay we sat down and talked
in his den I put his feet up on his
coffee table which there were Air Force
magazines on sitting on top and directly
to our left was a picture of him in the
White House with President Kennedy curse
May was fully dressed in his uniform and
I asked Curtis LeMay and I said I said
Curt and I said when you&#39;re in the Air
Force out of the one half percent of
sightings that came into the Air Force
how many of them were not identified he
said out of the one hundred percent that
came in only 35 percent of them could
not be identified and I asked him why
why couldn&#39;t they been identified and he
said because because of the craft are
too damn fast we can&#39;t catch them in
fact to use some foul language in there
- in his explanation and then I asked
him about the Roswell crash if that
really occurred and he looked over at me
and he shook his head yes that it did it
did occur and I said I was particularly
interested in the strange writings that
were found inside and I said what were
they ever deciphered he said far as he
under understood understood they were
not deciphered
Kerra when he was in office and then I
asked him about if he if he ever knew
where these things were coming from the
report of origin you know he looked over
at me again and he said he said don&#39;t
give anything to the CIA he said they
want their hands and everything they
usually do get their hands into
everything and they get away with it and
I said and I said what about the FBI and
he said no he said that&#39;s all wrapped up
within the Central Intelligence Agency
and they took it away from him and he
was he was angry he was angry about this
and he in fact he became so angry he
coughed and he grabbed his stomach as if
his stomach hurt what I found very
interesting about Curtis LeMay is that
Senator Barry Goldwater tried to get
close to the truth of course that was
many years ago before I&#39;d met Curtis an
egg and when Curt when I sat down to
talk to Curtis an a he he was kind of
apprehensive to talk to me about what I
was asking him about so I mentioned that
I met the former chief agent of Los
Angeles FBI
Richard Brett Singh and and he he didn&#39;t
know him but in that I mentioned a CIA
agent who I met whose name is Brett
Merrell he&#39;s now passed away was living
in Long Beach for a while then moved to
Layton Utah and then he passed away from
cancer he didn&#39;t know this gentleman
either but I told him what they told me
and then Curtis LeMay started to open up
and talk about what he told me about
Roswell and the crash that had occurred
and he told me that he was aware that it
that it wasn&#39;t ours it wasn&#39;t the
military&#39;s the Air Force of the army of
the Navy and it was highly strange was a
highly strange vehicle that crashed and
he took over the office from general
Nathan twining Nathan twining never told
him anything
either and apparently curtis lemay was
not aware of Twain&#39;s involvement in
majestic 12
and by the way majestic 12 is real mj-12
did exist but it does not exist today
the name was changed the positions are
still the same Henry Kissinger is very
well knowledgeable about what&#39;s going on
in the Kissinger was in in the loop as a
I was told and a friend of mine that
worked at the NSA he told me this he saw
Henry Kissinger&#39;s name on documents he
saw George Bush&#39;s name on some of the
documents he was made aware of what&#39;s
going on in about 1978 of Reagan was
fully briefed on the alien presence
Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev of Russia
about 75% of what&#39;s going on and then
Gorbachev became very very close to us I
find that highly strange CNN reporter in
Washington DC the second time that
Gorbachev came to America a CNN reporter
was able to interview Gorbachev and his
wife when they got out on the street and
they drove the security detail up the
wall and a a CNN reporter asked
Gorbachev do you think we should get rid
of all of our nuclear weapons and his
wife stepped in and she said no I don&#39;t
think we should get rid of all of our
nuclear weapons because of alien
spacecrafts now CNN put this story on
for for the half-hour the CNN Headline
News and I heard this and I jumped up
put a blank tape in to record the next
half hour
well that story disappeared you know who
did that you intercepted that that was a
CIA
that got involved with that because I
know they they were monitoring CNN and
all international headlines at that time
and they squash that but I heard it and
this and this tells me that that my
information is correct about Ronald
Reagan and for my NSA source and it&#39;s
just total overkill as far as I&#39;m
concerned and it&#39;s just Congress needs
to know about this information the news
media will not talk will not put the
real information on because they still
think it&#39;s it&#39;s a non subject and tell
somebody in power such as the Secretary
of State the director of the ministry
tur of NASA comes out and says something
about that there might be something to
it why I told him earlier about some
sightings that I were aware that I was
aware of in Nevada near mercury Nevada
near Tonopah and he said that the FBI
agent was his name was Richard Branson
he&#39;s now head of security at the Mormon
Church in Salt Lake City Utah and he had
referred me to the United States Air
Force office in LA near the Los Angeles
Airport office El Segundo Boulevard in
the 405 freeway and that they would be
interested interested in hearing reports
of closed sightings very close sightings
and even landings of these things and
curtis lemay shook his head yes and the
CIA agent Brett Merrell told me that he
had dealt with the United States Air
Force regarding missiles to try to shoot
these down when they come into our
airspace that&#39;s that&#39;s basically what
the CIA agent told me and he also told
the agent told me that that the CIA
agent told me
it was aware of the situation and it&#39;s
extremely classified but he was aware of
what was going on he was a national
intelligence agent he said that we had
several of them in Nevada / Ely Nevada
and other poor portions of New Mexico
near Albuquerque
Randy this was in the late 60s and 70s
I&#39;ve met a gentleman that was in the
Army in a CID that was involved with
several crash recoveries when he was in
the CID in 1947 when he became when he
was inducted in the United States Army
he was in the CID and sub several of his
friends were in the CIC
counterintelligence and they became very
close one another and he hand-picked a
friend of mine that worked at Boeing
aircraft company in Long Beach and to
become a part of a crash recovery
retrieval in northern Arizona
excuse me North northern New Mexico and
apparently he saw some of the aliens and
witnessed the craft and he was put guard
around this crash disk that had crashed
and they gave him a m1 carbine rifle -
to guard anybody to try to get close to
it and they were given orders to shoot
anybody without authorization they
recalled him on several other crashes
they had to fly him with blacked-out
windows to several of the crash sites
and some of the crash sites were very
putrid to smell he had to back up about
45 feet away from the craft to escape
the smelling set it&#39;s not like rotting
eggs intermixed with rotting mustard was
he said it was just horrible
and this is something that you knew yes
I personally know him he still currently
alive is he still working every tire no
he&#39;s retired and you know his name yes I
do not at this kind of did you meet
anyone else at Boeing that had been
involved in this area just that one of
the security guards that worked there
that was working for the Treasury
Department and he left disgusted because
of the low pay and he picked up a job at
McDonald&#39;s Aircraft Company because of
the better benefits and better pay scale
and he knew people in Secret Service and
they even some of those people in the
Secret Service know about that about the
alien connected projects and that the
phenomenon is real and I found that kind
kind of funny because they&#39;re not
cleared to hear the information they
don&#39;t have the classification to hear
the information but yet people in the
Secret Service know about it and I found
that kind of kind of hilarious and I
interviewed this security guard at
McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Company for
about 45 minutes regarding subject he
was trying to find out word there was
one crash that occurred one a crash
occurred in he believes that from his
commander was occurred in the desert of
New Mexico northern New Mexico and there
was another one that crashed in Nevada
near Ely Nevada and the other the other
crash a total of three he didn&#39;t know
where it was because nobody wanted to
talk about it and they were all told to
shut up so when he was on-site he didn&#39;t
you know where he was he was running on
a blackened crab rat that&#39;s correct they
were taken to several crash areas in an
aircraft there were then landed they
were taken by by Jeep they were told not
to look out the Jeep at all keep their
eyes in one one position they were told
not to talk to anybody they were in fact
one of the locations one of the military
officers said he goes gentlemen we&#39;re
not here on a Hollywood movie set this
is a highly classified mission you&#39;re
not even supposed to talk to your to
your family about this and they had they
had to sign security oath statements
that they would not talk about this for
50 years
regarding the crash sites that were they
were taken to these gentlemen saw my
friend had seen personally they did
aliens they had almond shaped eyes
darken a rather large head
lard little bit larger than human head
the bodies were about the size of about
a nine-year-old child their hands were
they had four fingers North no thumb
they were all data all he he told me
they all look like they came out of a of
a mold because they all looked the same
and their mouse world is a small slid
the typical description that that&#39;s out
and then filled real small ears no hair
in the head just really strange looking
to him he thought they were probably a
part of a genetic research of possibly
of the Germans but the technology that
he saw in the craft could not be of
German technology because of the fiber
optics that were found inside and some
of the slide switches that that they had
inside the craft we didn&#39;t
have and nobody else on earth would have
that type of technology what dates for
these in general this was this was
started in 1947 there were more crashes
than Roswell that people don&#39;t
understand is that there was one in 1948
there was another one in 1949 the 1949
crash was a rather large craft and the
people inside were a little bit taller
they&#39;re about five eight tall and these
individuals noses were quite long they
kind of looked like the ancient not the
Sumerians but the there&#39;s a race like I
can&#39;t I can&#39;t recall at this time but
there&#39;s an eight they looked a lot like
an ancient race around Palestine of
probably about 3,000 BC they he told me
that he picked up one of these aliens
and put it on on board of one of the
Jeeps
he said it felt like the aliens felt
like probably about 45 pounds at most
maybe 40 and he they put him in body
bags and took them to four hours are
what he told me they took them to to
wright-patterson Air Force Base at the
time later they started taking some of
them to Colorado and northern New Mexico
and then later on at area 51 in the
nineteen late 1960s all crash debris and
Technology and anything that had to do
with the alien connected phenomenon all
went to area 51 the these crafts were
circular shaped they were they were not
Chevron shaped and they were very very
light six people lifted up a 60 foot in
diameter craft and put it on a carry-all
and
he said it was just really strange metal
he he rubbed his hand on and that felt
really smooth like somebody had just
buffed it out with a buffer did he
indicate how they came to be disabled
yes he said that he was far Zika could
gather from his friend see I see the FBI
was checking into this too they were
interested as to why these things were
crashing and they found out that the
radar testing and New Mexico was the
cause of a lot of them that were
crashing and high-power transmitters
when they would get too close to
transmitters they would cause
interference like on 6 meters or UHF
high-powered transmissions they would be
able to interfere with her guidance
control and they would just crash and
other craft that craft the crashed we
had shot him down with with our raw
military weapons that&#39;s one of the
things that I do remember the M telling
me that there&#39;s another alien group that
looks a lot like of the human race and
they&#39;re called the orange threw my
mother at Boeing aircraft company my
mother&#39;s now deceased and her friend has
now deceased now I can talk about it
my mother had met a tube bender in
McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Company which
is now Boeing and his close friend
worked at Northrop they he was working
on the stealth program at the time and
this guy is an absolute brain and
mathematical with mathematical figures
and fixing things and making things work
and correcting everything that to make
everything work the the higher-ups at
Northrop were dumbfounded by this guy
and they recommended m22 to work with
the project&#39;s up at area 51 in Nevada
and apparently he was been he&#39;s been
working up there for at least five years
and they had they inducted him into the
alien connected projects to work
specifically on the technology and tried
to figure out how these things work to
back engineer them in fact I asked him
where they&#39;re coming from and he told me
he said you know I can&#39;t answer that
that&#39;s so highly classified and another
reason why he didn&#39;t answer it regarding
where these things were originating from
is that his his son is still working
within the connected projects and he
didn&#39;t want to even even talk about it
but he did tell me that he worked on the
craft to back engineer them he&#39;s aware
of their existence he knows that I met
chip the chief of staff of the Air Force
general MA
he told me several times of the testing
that took place at area 51 that some of
them come up behind the mountain and
he&#39;s just blank out and disappear and
then they appear about 15 20 miles away
from where he originally saw it within
about 20 seconds and just reappear and
do that eating may 19 oh no these are
the real things is these these are the
ones the craft that he has been working
on and they go why is killing that oh
that&#39;s this is us this is our military
testing these vehicles up at every 51 he
does an 8 by the extraterrestrials I
would like to work up there he said you
know you&#39;re better off working at Boeing
because it&#39;s a very very restrictive and
repressive place to work and he said
you&#39;re better off that Boeing because
the security at area 51 they have
security within security watching other
people there are other security people
and it drives them up the wall too and
it drives the employees up the wall
that&#39;s why they have a big exodus up
there of some of the employees that work
there they just they can&#39;t stand the
environment up there because you can&#39;t
do anything you can&#39;t talk to anybody
you can&#39;t it&#39;s just what you said it&#39;s
horrible it&#39;s a horrible place to work
fifty ones just uh it&#39;s just a horrible
place to work it&#39;s like working in
Russia when Russia was communist
communist country he was working for
Northrop directly for Northrop he was
not working for the military any of the
military services at all he was
receiving his paycheck from Northrop the
North had involved in the gay eighty-one
oh yes so does Lockheed Martin Boeing
aircraft they do trucking for area 51
Boeing aircraft Hughes most of the major
defense contractors have something to do
with area 51 they&#39;re not led into what&#39;s
going on they&#39;re not left they&#39;re not
even allowed access to ss4 site for but
they do they do truck for Boeing trucks
for for area 51 I do know that for sure
I found that out from a friend at Boeing
that told me that they were hiring up
there for trucking for some of the
military sites up there I found out from
him that he had personally gone on to
area 51 escorted to area 51 from Leo
main highway did this contact by the way
he passed away now well what&#39;s one plane
here discussing now but yeah oh no no
he&#39;s still alive no no he&#39;s still alive
in fact he knows where the aliens are
originating from in fact I asked him
that and he absolutely refused to
discuss the which I previously stated
that he&#39;s not an alle theme or he did
hit Belling oh no he&#39;s fully retired far
as he understands there is an
underground area there and there&#39;s a lot
of extraterrestrial debris down below
very 51 stored some sort of a
containment area and
but he he had he has never seen any
extraterrestrial that every 51 walking
around conversing with anybody there at
every 51 or s4 that&#39;s just the just the
craft and the technology that they&#39;re
trying to extract from these vehicles to
incorporate that technology into our
fighters and possibly some of our space
programs developed propulsion our energy
systems from that day just basically
laser technology and Soundwave defense
mechanisms Soundwave to blow up tanks of
buildings with the just sound waves and
some of the laser technology came from
from these craft he told me about and
we&#39;re incorporating this technology from
these craft that area 51 and I also
found out that they are moving a lot of
the personnel and some of the equipment
and some of the techniques are
terrestrial technology equipment and the
craft to base up in Utah he mentioned
there&#39;s a base in here in California
near Anza California and there&#39;s another
base in the deserts of taupe I believe
he said Tok Tok home or tow home as I
believe he said took home took home I
believe I believe that&#39;s the the word
that he used there&#39;s a base near
Lancaster and Palmdale area and near
this is very funny it&#39;s near Northrop
there&#39;s an underground area out there
too that he was aware of and but he
particularly mentioned and stayed
focused on Anza California well there&#39;s
some underground areas up there too that
they&#39;re researching some of this
technology and
call at March Air Force Base through
Project red light magic red line project
red light is a program to test these
vehicles and extract as much information
as possible from the alien connected
projects to find out how these things
operate and gain as much information to
possibly uses for our advancement for
our like I said our for our fighters and
bombers and for space connected proud of
connected projects and it further
verifies what I was told by people that
were in the Army and Air Force and
people that worked at area 51 to
cooperate what&#39;s going on regarding a
project red light and project red light
is still continuing as of this day he
wasn&#39;t out of Nellis he was out of area
51 primarily a Northrop hired him to go
up there and help the cause up at area
51 if try to find out how these things
work and I believe he started in 1980
and he left there probably about 1997
and by the way project red light and
project a grudge they&#39;re all here
intermixed the director of project
Bluebook robert friend told me this he
was fully aware of project red light and
he formerly used to work at fairchild
and read on the beach on aviation and
Rosecrans and we talked for about an
hour on the phone and he was also
reluctant to talk to me about the
phenomenon until I told him that I met
general LeMay well and of course the CIA
agent too in the FBI agent and so then
he started to open up and talk to me
about about the situation of UFOs and I
asked him about some of the crash debris
that was taken to area to
wright-patterson Air Force Base after
the Roswell crash and he had told me
that yes some of the debris
the bodies were taken to
wright-patterson Air Force Base in
Dayton Ohio
and some of the other stuff were taken
to a base in Florida and and that
shocked me because I never heard
anything about a base in Florida some of
the crash debris had been being taken to
Florida and and then I told him you know
I know somebody that used to work at the
National Security Agency he had a
top-secret umbra clearance and he also
told me about some of the information
about the aliens and then then he really
opened up and started to release
information and then you know I said you
know I understand that you wrote project
grudge Blue Book report number thirteen
he said yes and I asked him I said where
are these were these craft coming from
and he told me he didn&#39;t even know where
these these craft were coming from all
he knew was that the aliens are real
he&#39;s aware that they&#39;re coming here
they&#39;re penetrating our airspace they&#39;re
trying to become close to us the aliens
want to become close to us for some
reason or another they want to try to
look like us because they know something
is coming what that is I don&#39;t know we
are absolutely 100% aware of what&#39;s
going on regarding this intrusion into
our airspace and that we&#39;re trying to
get a lid on this to try to minimize the
sightings to quell the the news media
and the witnesses that are reporting
these sightings to the news media and to
try to draw a interest in this to try to
push for a congressional investigation
and even the Air Force didn&#39;t want this
they wanted to push this thing under the
rug and continue to research this and
just get a handle on it and try to get
as much information and technology out
of these crafts as fast as they could
and
to steer the news media off on some
crazy idea that these sightings were
created by college pranks and balloons
and meteorological problems and they
just did try to sweep it right into the
rug and this is what robert friend told
me that the whole project was to collect
as much information as they could and a
lot of the information was siphoned off
by the CIA and the National Security
Agency and people at O&amp;I Office of Naval
Intelligence now this in fact that that
he had mentioned that there were other
agencies clamoring for control and in
fact going right directly to the
President to get that control what he
told me regarding the security
ramifications were that if if they&#39;re
military personnel were to talk about
this they could be court-martialed or at
least threatened to be court-martialed
to get him to back down and to scare
them and other intimidations
would be the holder pay checks back
transferring to other bases were a lot
of people would not want to go to like
Alaska well through my NSA contact he
was in the army
the NSA is a part of the army he was in
advanced intelligence gathering he had a
top secret Umbra clearance he trained up
and at the NSA at Fort Meade and then
they transferred him to a satellite
monitoring station and he had to receive
several transmissions from the Pentagon
and from other satellite monitoring
stations of the NSA that they were
tracking of TVs extraterrestrial
vehicles and this is the lingo within at
the NSA how they communicate back and
forth
CTV&#39;s other military services refer to
them as bogeys or a long time ago UFOs
of course now they&#39;re considered to be
flying saucers he had told me that the
NSA is fully aware of the
extra-terrestrial presence we&#39;ve entered
intercepted many of their signals during
the 60s and we were testing
transmissions to try to jam their
transmissions and and to try to
communicate with them and he had told me
that he was aware of top-secret bases in
Colorado that were monitoring the
situation and there was another base in
London that is also monitoring the
situation regarding extraterrestrials
through mi5 and mi6 he told me that the
president of United States Jimmy Carter
was alerted to several events that were
taking place overseas he had handled
that transmission personally he what he
basically told me is that the NSA is
fully aware of what&#39;s going on in an
area called the puzzle palace Carter was
brought up to speed regarding some event
that were taking place over in Iraq and
Iran where several near misses occurred
and some of the Iranian forces fighter
jets which we sold to them United States
military aircraft
they chase some of these vehicles and
their incident instrumentations went
crazy and one of the fighter jets almost
crashed but he pulled away from the from
the object the huge circular shaped
object and he regained his control of
his fighter jet and he personally
handled that traffic to to the Pentagon
through the NSA it was all decrypted
fact Jimmy Carter was not brought into
the loop they for some reason the group
the control group they begged is the
they don&#39;t trust the guy for some reason
they don&#39;t trust Jimmy Carter they were
afraid that he would come out and make
statements blanketed statements to to
the news media and they just didn&#39;t
trust him they didn&#39;t trust you recorder
at all they left him out of the loop but
he was informed by the chairman and
Joint Chiefs of Staff that these events
were taking place over in Iran and Iraq
and earlier incidents were taking place
and their monitoring there monitoring
our war efforts and what we&#39;re doing
regarding nuclear bombs and and other
experiments the aliens he won the 1974
and he retired will not be left the
military the NSA and about 1985 he said
that he met Kissinger was involved with
with the study group back in the 50s
well to study the ramifications of this
information if it had leaked through a
credible source what would happen and
they were to do a study and pass off
classified information to outside study
groups such as the RAND Corporation and
other think tanks of this nature to
study what would happen if this
information were to be leaked out or to
talk talked about but from credible
people as to what would happen and Henry
Kissinger headed a some sort of a study
group basically was was controlled by by
Majestic twelve people then the
notorious mj-12 which is no longer
called mj-12 I&#39;m trying to find out the
new name of this group in fact the my
contact that worked worked at area 51
knows the name of the group but he&#39;s
refusing to tell me the name because it
was compromised in 1979 1980
basically it&#39;s it&#39;s an oversight group
here mingled with the National Security
Council and the national security
planning group in Washington DC it&#39;s an
overs over a oversight policy group like
the NS like the NSA and the National
Security Council but primarily there&#39;s a
group called the national security
planning point that oversees everything
and the majestic 12 is intermingled with
these people the national security
planning group they have full control
they alert the president of what&#39;s
taking place and he either authorizes or
just says you know hey you know you guys
go at it you know they have full control
they have no congressional oversight
whatsoever are they answer to nobody
except for the president United States
but they&#39;re trying they&#39;re trying to
push it aside away from the president
now well apparently that&#39;s that&#39;s
correct they no longer have that much
control over these groups anymore
they&#39;re just it&#39;s like a separate entity
how they&#39;re being funded I don&#39;t know I
can&#39;t find that information now I love
to find it out because I can tell you
one thing the General Accounting Office
they don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on they
don&#39;t know where the money is going they
don&#39;t know what these groups are doing
what they&#39;re studying and they hide it
all in black project operations they
could say it&#39;s for research on why ducks
don&#39;t fly that much or something like
that and they will just hide it in top
secret programs and the president&#39;s
losing control they just absolutely
starting to lose control over over this
that&#39;s why Carter and wasn&#39;t brought was
not brought into the loop they just
don&#39;t want to release the information
regarding the locations where they&#39;re
coming from where they&#39;re originating
from then some of the locations are from
Earth someday there&#39;s underground bases
here at earth where the aliens have
constructed bases a long long long
time ago before Columbus even discovered
America when I understand the these
areas would cause a major upset in fact
some of the areas were already found
through some of them forget the
investigations done by a television
network called sightings they found
several of the underground bases down in
Puerto Rico that&#39;s the kind of
information that the NSA is worried
about it&#39;s releasing the tracking
information because people that know how
to coordinate how where things are
coming from like air traffic controllers
degrees
what longitudes and where they&#39;re coming
from they could find out more of these
underground bases and this is why the
NSA is really afraid to releases
information and this is another reason
why the government of Puerto Rico
it is now fenced off the area where some
of these things are coming out of the
freshwater lake down there and we will
just buy off politicians down there to
get these things done basically that&#39;s
the information that the NSA is refusing
to release regarding the tracking and
they also cooperate back and forth with
the NRO
the National constants organization
regarding tracking and intercepts along
with NORAD the Air Force and the Army
they&#39;re all in on it and it&#39;s all
connected with the top-secret group
called Magi control what did he tell you
about magic controlling
magic control is controlled by the
Office of Naval Intelligence it&#39;s a top
secret collection group like the Central
Intelligence Agency and the NSA in fact
the O and I is just like the CIA it&#39;s a
top secret organization within the Navy
out of oh and I to collect top-secret
information
collect information on foreign
dignitaries foreign leaders the alien
connected project primarily it&#39;s similar
to the NSA and the CID it&#39;s all
encrypted information they have agents
out in the field just like the CIA
collecting information it&#39;s all very
very top secret operation looking glass
is a top-secret program project which is
ongoing up at area 51 to try to see into
the future to try to predict and
actually to see into the future a time
travel to find out what events will take
place in the future and from what I
understand it&#39;s currently ongoing up at
area 51 in connection with Project red
light did they indicate to let you know
I heard this from a CIA buddy of mine
that the see the same CIA agent that
that passed away from cancer up and up
in Utah what else did he share with you
CIA and can you share his name oh yeah
Bruckner oh okay you have the same one
yeah he sure with you anything else so
that&#39;s interesting did he share that
there was actually device that assisted
in this sort of time-travel it derives
from the alien technology did not get
into what it looks like or how big it is
or anything like that but it derived
from comes from the alien technology
itself they the aliens can go into the
future and find out what events will
take place many years into the future
and they can also go back in time to
course anti-gravity most of the craft
operate on anti-gravity and electoral
electric grid prophetic propulsion and
oh yeah of course they the aliens are at
least at least 4,000 to 5,000 years
advanced in our tech current back in
1947 I would say but we have jumped so
fast in our technology of course with
their help back in 1947 the scientists
would say while he&#39;s guys or at least
4,000 5,000 years advancing us over us
but now I would estimate the only if we
would say it an f1 would crash now
without any help to where we at now our
technology we would say there probably
about maybe probably about 400 years
advanced over us and with technology
without any without any help from them
if something would crash now oh yeah
we&#39;re we&#39;re just about at the conclusion
state right now regarding anti
anti-gravity that&#39;s why so these little
cute little toys are now coming out that
are anti-gravity like like a little top
that that&#39;s the sits there and Aaron
spins
I&#39;ll give it about maybe about 15
years and we&#39;ll have cars that will
levitate using this type of technology
oh yeah we we&#39;re doing it up at area 51
right now some of the stuff that my
buddy worked on up at area 51 who lives
now in Pahrump Nevada but through North
Road but yes we flying vehicles up there
right now and in Utah right now he had
to have them up at area 51 and they sent
him right up there gave him the
clearance top-secret carve Clarence Bob
Lazar would probably mentioned I would
probably recognize that Clarence is
top-secret carve they are right to carve
a steak or something to carve a turkey
and oh yeah he was he&#39;s aware of where
the aliens are coming from where their
point of origin are and he&#39;s just
refusing to tell me this information is
just so highly classified he be hired oh
yes he&#39;s retired Randy programs are the
treasure brother well I know that Litton
is for an absolute fact
Whitney Hughes electronics optical out
here in California next to the Los
Angeles Airport
well McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Company
was at a small level now they&#39;re at a
big level now because Boeing bought
McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Company out I
know that Boeing is at the at least the
transportation mode right now but they
will get into the aircraft mode year
2001 to help them out with the projects
at in Utah and Nevada fact Boeing has an
operation in Salt Lake City event Salt
Lake City Utah right now so that&#39;s not
going to be any problem for for our
government to pull them right in because
they&#39;re right in the they moved every 50
most of the stuff from area 51 at least
35% to 40% of very 51 to Utah
just basically those those companies and
of course Lockheed and Northrop well the
primarily people that work at area 51
they they want to do 4x4 they bill get
it if they want the special foods
according to their tastes and they&#39;ll
get it if they want pay increases don&#39;t
get it they don&#39;t have to strike like
like people working for other companies
no for a union or non-union company they
don&#39;t have to strike they&#39;ll get it
yeah they they they live like kings from
all of the contacts that I&#39;ve met my
final conclusion in my thoughts about
this is that the reason why our
government is afraid to release this
information is because of religion this
would probably destroy how we see
ourselves
I think they should start releasing some
of the information that we have managed
to collect on Mars regarding the face on
Mars which I know for a fact is real
through in fact I have another contact
at now at NASA JPL that I that I haven&#39;t
mentioned I can&#39;t mention too much about
it because he&#39;s still working here well
their date the person that I know is
very high up in NASA he&#39;s not a he&#39;s not
a director or an administrator but they
know what&#39;s going on they they know it&#39;s
a face they know it that it was carved
by somebody else other than us they the
NASA JPL
higher-ups in personnel there at JPL
they know for a fact and in the imaging
area they know for a fact that the face
on Mars is real and it was not made by
windstorms or a trick of lighting or
anything like that
they know for a fact that the face on
Mars was made from an extraterrestrial
race that came here to Earth at about
forty five thousand years BC and set up
civilization here
on earth and went back and forth to read
from Mars to our planet Earth to give us
information and to further prove the
race that they created which is us this
is this is a shock to the human populace
and I think I think it&#39;s the the big
reason why NASA and all the governments
especially United States are refusing to
release this information because one
thing will lead to another and somebody
will come to a conclusion that we were
created by an extraterrestrial race that
came to this solar system and set the
planets in their proper order which they
are now in and exploded the gaseous
planet that which we call the Sun and
thus God said let there be light this is
this would be shocking to to everybody
here on earth and this is what they&#39;re
afraid of releasing and that&#39;s my final
conclusion regarding this investigation
and who the aliens are I really feel
that the aliens that were on planet Mars
came here and set up our civil
civilization as we now know it and they
created these grey extraterrestrial
aliens to watch over our planet to make
sure we don&#39;t blow up their creation and
their planet leaving soon the
corporation because it had the little
bug or the logo
and I took after I got through folding
that I took it over to this old guy that
was training me and teaching me and
working with me and he was one pushing
through it I don&#39;t remember his name I
said look at look at this ain&#39;t I
gravity chamber and he goes you&#39;re not
supposed to be working on this and you
didn&#39;t see that and put it back and
don&#39;t say anything about it before we
get in trouble
