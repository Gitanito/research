I am 42 now and my experience occurred, as I was about 16 – 17.  It was on the week-end. My sister had a boy-friend then who knew someone who could drive us to the night club with his car. On the outward journey, I felt unsafe as I saw how this person drove. And driving back, about one mile from the night club, the driver lost control of his car. There was a very thick fog. The driver tried to get a cassette off the car radio. When he raised his head, we were in a curve and he had no time to regain control. We turned and turned. The car tires screeched. The wipers worked on their own. The fog was so thick that we did not see anything. 

This is when I knew I was dying. I had a belief that came from inside and filled my head. It told me, 'You are dying'. I emphasize 'You', as I did not talk to myself. This feeling was as if I had always known. Then my life rewound just like a cassette, like a movie, to come back to start, i.e. my birth. The only image that is burnt forever in my mind is when I saw my mother feed me, as I was an infant. She was on my right side. Anyway, it would have been unthinkable for her to stand on my left. The fridge was small and next to my mother. I was facing the scene as a spectator. 

I was awfully scared by the thought of dying, as I certainly did not wish to die. Besides, I told to myself 'What shall my mother say?' I was scared that she would scold me at the thought that I was dying. Behind, my sister was screaming. My door opened, and I believed I would be ejected from the car; I grabbed the driver's arm. Then the car came to a stop. While getting out, I could not recover my balance and suffered a severe headache, which lasted until the morning on the next-day, same for my sister. It took me a very long time to tell my parents about it. When I did, I asked my mother whether she recalled the small fridge, but she answered no. Same for my sister, she never lived something similar. The lesson I learned from that is: life is no game, you’d better not step into a car with a driver you don’t know. I believe this was a means to scare us in order for us to be aware of the danger. 

A few years after my experience, the book 'Life after Life' by a doctor. was published. I wanted to buy one then, but I did not know what it was precisely about. It’s been about ten years since I have got it. I understood then why I wanted to buy it. I talked about it to a friend who also had a NDE; she saw the tunnel and the light.  It’s this doctor's book, which convinced me of her experience. Since all this, I've been interested in the NDE's. I try to understand and compare with things we know. I find many similarities with everything about space, like, 1) The fact that you float; 2) The fact that you find yourself in a celestial body; 3) The fourth dimension world. I believe there is indeed research to be completed in this area."	"The only image that is burnt forever in my mind is when I saw my mother feed me as I was an infant. She was on my right side.
