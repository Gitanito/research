&nbsp;              NDE Poem </strong></u></span>   by Patrick Gillespie  

  There’s nothing so disquiets me
    As snow new-fallen on a tree—
    Autumn when the leaves have fallen
    And all beneath’s turned cold and sullen.     

    I’ve seen the dogwood petals bring
    Such beauty to the tree in spring
    But there’s another beauty, hidden,
    As long in coming and unbidden—

         Not in the clarion-gold of trees,
    The loveliest pitch of autumn, these
    Are not its colors, not the row
    Of bails whitening in the field—no,

         Not these. I’ve seen in darkening hours
    A few final radiant flowers
    Before they do not so much fall
    As fade and close; but these are all

         Another beauty. Later still
    When frost slips through the windowsill
    And I have had to scrape the glaze
    Of ice as though some crystalline haze

         Had covered up the world, then
    I’ve seen such beauty—only then,
    That for an instant veiled my sight,
    That blinded me to all—that light.

          

  				HEAVEN SENT    				
  				
  				I felt myself floating, being&nbsp;drawn by a light,
  				Around me was darkness whilst&nbsp;ahead it was bright.
  				
  				I heard Nana call me then&nbsp;saw her smiling face,
  				I reached out my arms so that we could embrace.&nbsp;      

  				I was led to a garden so hued and serene,
  				A place more wholesome than Earth had been.  &nbsp;     

  				An assembly of angels were poised up   				above,&nbsp;
  				their auras shimmered with celestial love.  &nbsp;     

  				I fell deep into thought as the angels   				drew near,
  				&quot;So what is this place and why am I here?&quot;  &nbsp;     

  				A voice from The Light whispered kindly   				and mild,
  				&quot;There&#39;s nothing to fear, you&#39;ve come home my Child.&quot;  
  				&nbsp;

  Poem by Tu YouYou translated to English by   Jenny.&nbsp; Tu YouYou is a Chinese biomedicine Nobel Prize winner.  &quot;If you are splendid, fate will provide you.  Don&#39;t chase a horse with intentions, but using the chasing efforts to plant seeds.    When spring comes and flowers bloom, there will be a thorough bred for you to choose from.    Don&#39;t flatter others on purposes, but rather improving yourself while you are friendless.    When the right time comes, there will be a fruitful of friends followed you.    It is temporary to gain friendship through granting favors to them, instead a character with virtues attracts long-lasting friends.     Hence, it is influential as you are enriched rather than to pleasing others.      As if planting a Sycamore tree, Phoenix enticed to come.      If you are fully blossomed, butterflies then come; if you are splendid, fate will provide you.&quot;

&nbsp;

By the direction of a friend, I found a beginning and an   end

There, I stood, with the sky, the ocean and earth

Not knowing if I was upright, upside-down or lying on my   back

Certainly, no in-betweens, even I was something – not   someone

And with the breeze, I felt my heartbeat

In the sun, I saw the moon

One. One place. One life – just one

And nothing more, nothing less

I was neither master nor servant

And people speak of heaven like it is a dream

But I know I have not been dreaming this time

I have found a heaven on this earth – there is no divide

Heaven and earth be the same

So too, night and day

I have journeyed this life in search of self, in search of   truth

Only to find that I am joined to you – that the world   indeed rests inside of me

Life and death are one

No we, no they, no that

And so I squat on the balls of my feet, with orange in the   sky reflecting in my eyes

But I have come to see that orange turns to blue – the   ocean is the sea

And I am all of these, they are something of me

I know that time stands still,&nbsp;in myself.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Rebirth

&nbsp;

Beyond the stars on a starry night, my eyes they seek a   distant sight

Whilst I’m seated in my throne, a story rises from my   throat

Hear this tale, as it comes to you, knowing that it could   be true

Stretch your arm into the east and you will come to dress   in west

Dip your tongue into the north – your mouth will come to   speak of south

And so I greet you with an open heart, as we approach this   tale’s start

Leave your baggage at the door, for in lightness we will   travel best

Thus, come then, take my words by the hand, and sink your   mind into the sands – then the journey can begin…

I did lay myself down to bed, to sleep – with stillness at   my shallow’s reach, and slumbered the wilds of the deep

When upon me dawned the voice of a silent morning sparrow

Woken in the early hour, by the presence of the eternal   power

As the unknown seated at my feet

I burrowed my head&nbsp;beneath the sheet

With darkness squawking at my head

I felt this weighing on my bed

And in the moment, I began to pray for meaning – thinking I   may be dreaming, and thus, I wished myself away

With courage in the belly, my knees had turned to jelly

My eyes, they swept fear aside and raced with the line of   the sheet, to meet the one who intruded

He, she, it – eluded my sensory vision, but no my primal   intuition, for my bed was still tilted as if pressed by lead

Instead, my eye caught the flicker – the flight of eternal   light, though I hear some snicker

Unhesitant, I reveal the deal

These eyes lay sight upon the most inviting holy light that   moved in the direction of the clocks of this world

It did twirl, around and around like a top – bop, bop, pop,   like the world – a black dot in the middle, at the core of the ripple

The lure of perfect love, as a kite in flight above mind’s   sky

Soothing my brow, hand at my crown, fingers of a velvet   glove, in love, how kindly

And finally, some tension, worth my time in mention

In this here revision, I will tell of my heart’s division

From the light, my eyes diverged as there emerged a   tormented spirit

A man out of flesh amidst our earthly sphere, yet lying so   near

I did not run away, nor hide, though I neither wished for   him to stay

I searched his blazed eyes, amazed, to find a well of   despair – more than you, or I&nbsp;could possibly bear

His eyes rolled back in sockets, as hell cried awake his   sleep

And I could weep solemn tears at this solemn man with a   peeled soul

But, I gasp at the sight of light – the cycle of life that   still dances in delight before my raw, remembering eyes

At the post of our feet, and at this moment of our meet

On the hour of an early morn, again, I was born.

  Poem   #2 by Barbara Patnaude</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; barapat@earthlink.net

    Why Me

    I was almost there and I don&#39;t know why

    I didn&#39;t know I was not&nbsp;  to die

    I don&#39;t remember any pain at all

    and what I recall is a love for all

    Not everyone can see this deep

    so I&#39;m cast aside by those not asleep

    I&#39;ve found a home where I&#39;m free to roam

    A place I call inside my own

    For we are here to let you know    We are   all to help love grow

  Poem   #1 by Barbara Patnaude</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; barapat@earthlink.net

I want to hear you, I want to feel you, I wait to see you You   are in my soul, you are my light, you are my might help us not to lose this   right keep our faith in your light change our failures and make us bright lead   us through these days and nights.

You are holy, you are life

You are love, you are right

Open our eyes, open our ears, let us know you dry our tears,   We are here as proof of you All I want is to talk to you I want to hear you, I   want to feel you, I wait to see you Your are in my soul, you are my light, you   are my might help us not to lose the right keep our faith in your light change   our failures and make us bright lead us through these days and night.

Walk by my side in the toughest fight

Help me praise you with all my life

Use me to be your light

  A True Story.

  I was twenty-two   years old, and it was the early nineteen seventies.

  A book landed in   my lap about the soul, reincarnation,

  our   Companion/Creator, and gratefully, the pieces fell together

  as was planned,   I’m sure.

  Suddenly, there   was nothing more important to me

  than restoring   the missing link with my Father/Creator.

  So one day,   armed with some suggested head, neck, and

  breathing   exercises that would only require a few minutes of

  concentration, I   embarked upon my first effort at meditation.

  I would talk to   my Creator in prayer, and then listen for Him.

  I was simply   happy to finally have a direction in life,

  which was now   and for the first time,

  to say hello to   my Creator and thank Him

  for choosing me   to be a part of this whole Eternal plan and clan,

  and to see if   there was anything I could do for Him.

  I sat in my best   comfortable attempt at a lotus cross-legged position.

  Now, I cannot   hand you my experience,

  that being the   pure and sincere intimacy through which my mind

  and heart   traveled for thirty or forty minutes or so, but trust me,

  my Entire heart   was in it.

  So if He had   Anything to say,

  there was   nothing more important to me

  from the tips of   my toes, to the torch in my heart,

  than to tune in.

  And I waited . .   .

  and heard   nothing; nothing at all.

  Eventually I   prayerfully said my good-byes to a voice I never heard and opened my eyes. I   felt inwardly good, unfolded my limbs, stretched out on the bed, and was smiling   now with eyes closed, basking in the comforting thought that I had the rest of   my life to learn how to hear God through meditation. I was proud of my first   effort and enjoyed an afterglow

  of inner   satisfaction . . .

  When suddenly

  there was a   “pop” sound/sensation in my head

  (and the   following is as best as I can describe the event).

  I am instantly   taken   on an ever-tightening Spiral of Flashing Light,

  moving at a   tremendous speed,

  seemingly   upward, yet inward

  and I am   inside what I can only describe

  as a   tiny diamond Fire Spark of Divinity

  (and God knows I   was not in control of the steering).

  Now, folks, when   the        I    within   the spiral comes to a stop,

  how do I say   this, except to say that,

“ O Lord, I am not worthy”

  was the only   all-consuming feeling and thought I could muster from

  within my very   nicely crumbling, overwhelmed, and grateful being,

  for I was held   in the Infinite Presence of the Face of God,

  beyond the scope   of anything we have ever dreamed of,

  and there are no   words to capture the indescribable

  divine   wonderment of the creative source of all life.

  It’s all way too   big for any of the boxes

  we have sought   to put our Creator in,

  so I can only   humbly,

  and do so now in   the name of peace,

  assure you,

  We are in   Unfathomably Good Hands.

  I don’t know how   long I was “there.”

  I was looking   into forever and stripped of my Timex.

  When my eyes   opened, I had returned as me, in this body, in this world,

  and I also   understood clearly,

  I was not of it.

  None of us are   native earthlings; but rejoice,

  we get the best   of all worlds.

  (Afterward, I   did recall that while I was in that Presence, it felt as though I was in some   sort of an invisible, spherical, almost egg-shaped protective energy bubble that   seemed to have provided me safe passage and kept me intact, as it were, though   nothing . . . could ever be the same.

  Implications   that I would like to point out:

  I would say that   I went from the consciousness of material solidity (the physical body,   the earth, and the awareness of myself as the human I am) and spiraled into   the realm and throne of our Divine Source,

  in maybe   five seconds!

  (And God knows   that traveling at the speed of Light eliminated any chance of me screaming for   help.)

  To me, that’s an   intriguing thought that begs contemplation in terms of the supposed reality we   find ourselves in. It seems as though time and space are conceptualized tools   of measurement at our disposal. They allow us the opportunity to experience and   express our divine self through the vehicle of the evolution of an individual   soul destined to be co-creative companions to the Creator.

  Wonder how we’re   all doing?

  I would say   divinely well, regardless of appearances.

  I saw God,

  though Not as a   man,

  as this   experience is apparently only made possible by accessing

  the spiritual   dashboard of Our Piece of the Spark and Spirit of Life.

  And trust me,   it’s the best piece you’ll ever have.

  Also, in an   effort to further convey the experience to the reader,

  I feel that the   phrase “I saw God” should be worded differently.

“ The Presence gave me sight of the Truth of Itself,”

  and the little   eyeball orbs we are used to using here

  had no meaning   there, and were knocked out of commission

  in favor of   absorbing the Light of the Divine Force of Life and Love.

  And I was   totally humbled,

  but not because   God wanted me to feel humble

  (nope, that was   all my idea),

  but because I   found it impossible to not melt before such as is our Father and Creator.

  (I doubt you   will do much better, but you won’t care anyway.)

  By the way, you   will find there are no “questions” floating around your mind at that moment

  (in case you are   saving up a good one for when you see Him next).

  All there is   really is one Way Big Answer.

  It has never   happened since (never needed it to), and I have always been amused at the fact   that it occurred only on my first attempt at meditation, and only when I had   finished that effort. My word for that is . . .

  cute

  (and I know   where my sense of humor came from).

  Another   implication I draw from the experience is that our religious dogmas and   doctrines most often do not support the possibility of any direct approach for   us to experience our divine self, plus we have generally accepted that our   invisible God is also unknowable and consciously perceived as a separate entity   from us. And “as you believe, so shall it be done” is again applicable to   what we do or don’t experience. We have many self-imposed boundaries that we   might do well to drop from our minds and hearts, but that is forever up to each   one of us and the paths we choose.

  I just wanted   people to know, you always have options

  that you may   have not even known existed.

  So thirty-seven   or so years have passed without ever hearing any information about anyone seeing   God lately. Then just recently, I stumbled upon a Hebrew word, the   Merkabah, via the Internet and YouTube. You may search “merkabah”   for yourself to retrieve the relevance I found to the above “true story.” But   suffice it to say, I was pleased to have found such information.

&nbsp;

  We know not of   what brilliance we proceed from

  unless we care   to seek and know of such stuff.

  And what Father   would hide from His children?

“ Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”

  Pretty simple   and direct,

  with no   qualifying time frame given for such endeavors.

  It’s always   totally up to us

  to seek whatever   we will, whenever we will.

  Also for the   record, I am not suggesting in any way

  that the purpose   of anyone’s life

  should be to   have a face-to-face meeting with God.

  The experiences   we seek are those that the soul outlines

  before arrival   and extension into this place.

  They may have   the appearance of something far removed from

  spiritual   endeavors, and yet be the perfect path for the soul.

  But I am sure it   will Never hinder the progress of any soul

  to wear the face   of God that we have been given

  in a manner that   promotes compassion, mercy, forgiveness,

  and goodwill   toward all man.

Poem by Walt Whitman

&nbsp; &quot;And what do you think has become of the women   and children?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They   are alive and well somewhere,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   the end to arrest it,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   And ceas&#39;d the moment life appear&#39;d.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   know it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash&#39;d

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   babe, and am not contain&#39;d between my hat and boots,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   and peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   and fathomless as myself

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   (They do not know how immortal, but I know.)&quot;

PEACE   POETRY

Religions are   based on scripture, which is mostly poetry. So it only makes sense that   religious conflict must be resolved through poetry, and not through politics,   negotiation, or war. I propose that all religious conflicts be redefined   poetically, so that they can be resolved without bloodshed, winners, or losers.   So let's sharpen our pencils, not our swords; send missives, not missiles; and   apply our minds to metaphor, simile, rhyme, meter, and prosody, but not   pomposity, animosity, ferocity, atrocity, or monstrosity. &nbsp;

  RENEW - a survival poem -   &nbsp; (c)   go2wardlove@gmail.com&nbsp;

  you constructed an equilibrium for your   tranquility &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  gave thanks in pause for lavished love's stability&nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  your roots, like talons for your everyday conviction&nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  sunk into the flesh of a life upheld in its distinction&nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  with all meaning locked in the knave of your life's valley&nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  taking stock of dreams-let-go, factoring a bitter tally&nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  hills too high for need to scale, trapped in fortification&nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  a valley holding its floods to garner immobilization&nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  thus with mud afoot your gait now growing ever heavy&nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  cabin walls demand rent in smiles - laboring unsteady &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  existing in monotony's service, clutching on to denial&nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  consoling your heart, cocooned and apart 
  &nbsp;
  in bitter trial 
  &nbsp;
  pendulum ticking, building anger not given in to hush &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  reason scattering like a raven startled from a brush &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  with raised fist to challenge the heavens for your plight &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  thunder crashes loudly, while hope gives way to night &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  when morning breaks you panic while viewing the debris&nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  a heart now broken, cursed to mend what it can not see &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  so you gather flint for fire while offering up a pity barter &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  compromise your only hope, bargaining a steep marker &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  depression wears your splendid gloom as if a silly hat &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  morbid mindset dripping self-sorry from a broken tap &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  senses lying frozen like frost bitten digits in the snow 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  hoping for reanimation in veins where blood once flowed &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  then from out of your cave you raise your beaten gaze &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  hope blossoms have sprouted from fire ravaged blaze &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  while too afraid to begin again steps are small and few &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  with trust as your sounding board you test the sky's blue&nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  time, in its patronizing way has healed impossible scars &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  serenity given acceptance, shards again becoming glass &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  the cycle complete graduating you with a knowing look &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  night gives back the gift of sleep and all the peace it took 
  &nbsp;

    HOSPITAL  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;By   Dina Grutzendler  
  
  
  A new energy-incarnates
  
  rips, knocking head first

  
  hoarse cry&nbsp;… 
  
  oh&nbsp; dim light knife in the pupil&nbsp;! 
  
  oh metallic ice&nbsp; bath on the bloody&nbsp; skin&nbsp;! 
  
   oh great fall into void ! ...&nbsp;  
  
  night - endless night -&nbsp; 
  
  roof-quasar fleeing fast&nbsp; 
  
  
  How can a mother in anesthesia vapor&nbsp; 
  
   touch&nbsp; the lonely cry of the child…? 
  
  How can the useless little hands&nbsp; 
  
  swim back towards&nbsp; the warm amniotic ocean?&nbsp; 
  
  
  Oh separating body!!

&nbsp;

  An own spirit has been given to each body &nbsp;  
  
  Each hermit has received his load
  
  
  The hospital doors are wide open&nbsp; 
  
  two shaking wanderers&nbsp; re-learn to walk&nbsp; 
  
  and welcome the new light full of painful noise&nbsp; 
  
  
  Hospital, you have injected energy into living matter&nbsp;! 
  
  
  In the middle of the road&nbsp; 
  
  a tumor seeds chaotic entropy&nbsp; 
  
  a stressed body has lost its order&nbsp; 
  
  the immune system army runs scattered&nbsp;… 
  
  the patient&nbsp; 
  
  is a silent moan between two worlds&nbsp; 
  
  is a collapse dragged through naked corridors&nbsp; 
  
  
  In the operating room&nbsp; 
  
  energy spreads its huge wings&nbsp; 
  
  and dances on a tightrope&nbsp; 
  
  
  Perhaps the traveler &nbsp; 
  
  will cry through his salty blisters&nbsp; 
  
   the sea will bathe him, returning him to the first cell&nbsp; 
  
  the sun will toast two bodies
  
  in total loving embrace 
  
  with ultraviolet caress and infrared ardor&nbsp;

&nbsp;

  The child entered the   world of the great powerful

  inflated a judge   arrogance

  to fall subjugated

  in his own abyss

  under his feet

  &nbsp;

  and I always in love   with Jung……

  &nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  with Eckhart he blew   apple-rose life

  with Shopenhauer he   complained of pain

  and with Kant he knew

  &nbsp;

  One day he dreamed   protecting a light

  between his shell of   hands

  the tiny consciousness   light

  was small

  beside the powerful   shadows of darkness

  but his , his only one

  &nbsp;

  he could bear the   coldness of poverty

  with his creator light

  he accepted to know   himself

  without being known

  &nbsp;

  and I always in love   with Jung……

  A Beautiful Moment   by Jordan Blake Crump

  Death.

  This frenzy of blood and tears

  Her face, I have never seen such despair

  As I was merely a cold body, just lying   there

  But in that moment, I no longer cared

  For a peace of suddenness came over

  A wonderful serenity, a sweet tranquility

  I think and I feel, I therefore still am

  Defying all that is known to man

  I now look above, to see the endless   entities

  Where the heavens collide, so looming they   seem to be

  I wondered much of my time about these   things

  All so real, tangible and most divine

  There is a presence, the stars are quick   to disappear

  The speed at which we move, light should   fear

  Behold, the Lord of hosts, the great   Spirit, the most high God

  My spirit is here a dying candle held to   raging sun

  From child to man, no deed was left undone

  Here, the answers are, the knowledge   complete

  Here, the world but a shadow that cannot   compare

  I was born here and here I am most aware

  My life now but a faint and distant dream

  For here there are colors no man has ever   seen

  A transcending of time, for it is not of   the human mind

  What they say and show, the world does not   know

  Living, luminous things, much wonder,   awesome harmony

  A most high pleasure of warm amity

  I wish, I wonder how, if I am here forever   to be

  My God! My God! Please never stop loving   me!

  In one thought, I see the entirety of time

  It whistles before me, like a wind powered   chime

  An all-powerful Spirit of energy untold

  Like lightning burning through a mirror of   gold

  Therein one feels the vibrations of   omnipotent power

  Living light in the purest form, burning   white fire

  This is what I see here with my very own   sight

  The Spirit and nothing but this blinding   light!

  My God! My Father! you are most High!

  For it is love I know I see what is of   thee!

  I think back to that moment, just seconds   gone by

  My life, my wife, my love, I know now why

  That I scream love forever across a land   so high!

  My dearest, my love, the rest of me

  You need to know what I now see

  Here in this beautiful moment, eternity

  The Father and I in spiritual uniformity

  Know this is so my life, my love, my whole

  This is truly for nothing, but for you to   know

&quot;I CAN'T STOP ASKING WHY&quot;
  (c) 2006 TOMMYE RODRIGUES 
  
  
  IT'S COZY HERE BESIDE THE FIRE
  WHERE I FEEL YOU ARE NEAR
  WHERE THE SCENT OF YOU
  STILL LINGERS IN THE AIR
  AND MEMORIES OF YOU ARE EVERYWHERE
  
  
  FRIENDS CALL OR STOP BY
  EVERY NOW AND THEN
  BUT ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION
  I PRETEND I'M NOT IN
  IT SEEMS SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GONE
  I JUST WANT TO BE ALONE
  
  
  I SPEND HOURS AT THE WINDOW
  STARING AT THE SKY
  WATCHING WINTER CLOUDS
  AS THEY GO RUSHING BY
  
  
  BUT ALL THE WHILE I WATCH
  I AM FOREVER ASKING &quot;WHY?&quot;
  AND HEARING NO ANSWER
  THOUGH IT SHAMES ME TO SAY
  ALL I CAN DO IS CRY
  I CRY LIKE A BABY EVERY DAY
  
  
  I KNOW HE HAD A REASON
  FOR TAKING YOU AWAY
  A YEAR AGO THIS LONELY WINTER DAY
  THE GRANDEST OF REASONS
  SURELY COSMIC IN DESIGN
  
  
  AND I ACCEPT HIS WILL BUT STILL
  I CAN'T STOP ASKING &quot;WHY?&quot;
  AND HEARING NO ANSWER
  ALL I CAN DO IS CRY
  SOMETIMES IT SEEMS I CRY ALL THE TIME
  
  
  I WATCH A MILLION SNOWFLAKES
  RUSHING TO THE GROUND
  SILENCING ALL OUR NORMAL CITY SOUNDS
  WHY THEN DO I HEAR CHURCH BELLS
  RINGING LOUD AND CLEAR
  WHEN THE NEAREST CHURCH TO US
  LIES MILES AND MILES FROM HERE?
  
  
  AND HOW CAN I SEE A RAINBOW 
  WHEN THERE ISN'T ANY RAIN?
  STRANGE MYSTERIES LIKE THESE
  NOW HAPPEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN
  
  
  I HAVE ONE NEW FRIEND I AM HAPPY TO SAY
  A LARGE YELLOW BUTTERFLY WHO VISITS ME EACH DAY
  EVEN NOW, WITH SNOW STACKED ON THE GROUD
  HE DOES HIS LITTLE DANCE FOR ME
  WITH NO MUSIC, NOT A SOUND
  &quot;OH, HOW VERY AMAZING,&quot; I CAN HEAR YOU SAY
  AND I SUDDENLY REALIZE THAT HE NEVER CAME 
  UNTIL YOU WENT AWAY
  
  
  YES, SUDDENLY I RECOGNIZE
  IN THESE SEEMING MYSTERIES
  THE ANSWER I HAD BEGGED HIM FOR
  AT LEAST A THOUSAND TIMES
  THE ANSWER TO ALL OF MY &quot;WHY'S&quot;
  
  
  YES, SUDDENLY I KNEW! I KNEW!
  HOW COULD I NOT HAVE SEEN?
  HE WAS SHOWING ME
  THAT WHERE YOU ARE WITH HIM
  I WILL SOMEDAY BE
  AND I WILL FIND YOU WAITING THERE
  PATIENTLY FOR ME
  
  
  HIS SIGNS HAD BEEN PRESENT
  EACH AND EVERY DAY
  BUT BLINDED BY MY TEARS AND GRIEF
  I SIMPLY COULDN'T SEE
  AND THAT WAS HOW I CAME TO LOSE MY WAY
  
  
  NOW I KNOW, I KNOW, WITHOUT A DOUBT
  THAT YOU HAVE NOT LEFT ME FOREVER
  YOU HAVE JUST GONE AWAY FOR A WHILE
  AND I WILL JOIN YOU WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT
  AND KNOWING THIS, I CAN WAIT, YES, I CAN WAIT FOR THAT DAY
  WHEN I WILL JOIN YOU IN GOD'S HEALING LIGHT

    &nbsp;A CURIOUS INTERMISSION By NDEr  Richard T 
  
  SO MUCH AM I COMPELLED TO SAY 
  ‘ERE THE TURN OF A COLD MARKED DAY, 
  YET, WHY SHOULD I SAY ALL THIS 
  WHEN I’LL NOT CARE OF WHAT AFTER IS? 
  
  FOR I AS A CHILD, WAS ONCE THERE 
  LOOKING BACK AT ALL WITH JUST A STARE. 
  NO THOUGHTS, NO CRIES, NO HEART FELT PAIN,.. 
  JUST A SILLY HUMANS GAME. 
  
  THE PREACHER, HE, JUST CLOSED THE BOOK 
  AND GAZED AT ME WITH A SOLEMN LOOK, 
  TEARS HE COULD NO LONGER HIDE 
  RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS, AS I DIED. 
  
  WHY? THOUGHT I, DID THEY ALL CRY? 
  WERE THEY SORRY FOR MY LOSS OF LIFE? 
  OH, WELL. SAY’S I, TO ME, MYSELF 
  AS I FLOATED OUT T’WEEN WALL AND SHELF. 
  
  SO STRANGE, THINK I, SO CURIOUSLY, 
  AS I LOOK BACK AT THE SPIRIT ME, 
  NO QUESTIONS THEN, NO NEEDS YOU SEE, 
  WHEN YOU ENTER WHERE NO OTHERS BE. 
  
  UP INTO CEILING BETWEEN THE FLOORS 
  NO DOCTORS, NURSES, NOR CARES NO MORE. 
  I COULD SEE THE GIRDERS GRAY WITH DUST 
  ALL IN A DARKNESS THAT ONE COULD TRUST. 
  
  I TURNED AND KNEW A TUNNEL BLACK, 
  SHOULD I ENTER? OR, NOW TURN BACK? 
  ALIKE THE CORD I KNEW AT BIRTH, 
  QUITE HESITANT; A BIT, AT FIRST. 
  
  FEET FIRST I WENT THEN DOWN INSIDE 
  A WHOLE LOT LIKE A TUNNEL SLIDE, 
  DOWN ON DOWN I SLOWLY MOVED 
  AFLOAT INSIDE THE CENTER TUBE. 
  
  HANDS AND FEET AGAINST IT’S SIDES 
  I THOUGHT MIGHT STOP MY FLOATING GLIDE. 
  YET, STILL FASTER DID GO I, 
  NO FRICTION MET ON EITHER SIDE.

    ‘THOUGH ALL WAS DARK, NO SIGHTS THERE SEEN, 
  ALL FEAR OF PAIN WENT OUT OF ME. 
  MY TRAVERSE THEN SLOWED AND LEVELED OUT 
  A LIGHT WAS SEEN REMOVING DOUBT. 
  
  FOR THIS TUNNEL HAD AN END IN STORE 
  IT’S AT THE MIDDLE OF ALL LIFES’ CORE. 
  SO QUICKLY THEN I ENTERED SPACE 
  A LOVE LIGHT GLOWING AT A GENTLER PACE. 
  
  THE BRIGHTEST LIGHT&nbsp;WITH A GOLDEN HUE 
  WAS SURROUND ME THERE AND FILLED ME TOO. 
  SUSPENDED LIFE; A CONSCIENCE NEW,&nbsp;
  JOINED&nbsp;ME THERE, JUST US TWO. 
  
  NO PONDERED QUESTIONS OF MY COURSE 
  FOR I WAS WITH ALL LIFE’S FORCE. 
  THE CENTER OF NO DIMENSION SHOWN 
  WAS ASKING ME OF ALL I’D KNOWN. 
  
  FIRST HE ASKED IN A TRANSFERRED THOUGHT 
  TO RECALL ALL SORROW FROM THE LIFE I’D LOST. 
  AND WE TWO SHARED FOR A MOMENT THEN 
  AS WOULD SECRETS PASS BETWEEN TWO FRIENDS. 
  
  THEN &quot;LET IT GO&quot; HE SAID TO ME 
  SO THAT HE COULD SHARE HIS INNER PEACE. 
  HIS LIGHT SURROUND, IT TURNED WARM GOLD 
  AS HIS LOVE FOR ME WAS THEN FULL SHOWN. 
  
  HE NEXT THEN ASKED TO RECALL ALL JOY 
  I HAD KNOWN ‘TIL THEN AS A LITTLE BOY. 
  A WARMTH OF CHILDHOOD MEMORIES DEAR, 
  FILLED ME SO TO BRING FORTH TEARS. 
  
  AT THIS HE SMILED WHILST I SHARED ALONE 
  FOR THIS HE SURELY, HAD ALWAYS KNOWN. 
  
  HIS NEXT PURE THOUGHT FROM HIM TO ME? 
  A BALANCE FOR THE WHOLE OF THEE. 
  AT THIS THOUGHT WE SHARED NO GLAD, 
  FOR THE BALANCE SHOWED SO MUCH MORE SAD. 
  
  OF LIFE? WELL, THEN, WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
  WAS THE LAST HE EVER ASKED YOU SEE. 
  NO ANSWER DID I HAVE JUST THEN, 
  SO, BACK TO LIFE, I WENT AGAIN. 
  
  HIS PARTING THOUGHTS, THEY CAME TO ME, 
  AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A MYSTERY,..
  “YOUR LIFE’S NOT DONE, YOU’VE A PURPOSE STILL, 
  A MISSION YOU’RE ON, YOU’VE YET TO FILL.”

  Experiences, by   Richard Waller&nbsp; 
  
  The secret's out - it's no use -
  Emily Dickinson's no recluse!
  She tells us how the sunset washes
  The shores of the Yellow Sea,
  Where it rose, and where it rushes;
  Of railway trains that lap the miles
  By shanties and mountain piles.
  She writes of men on battlefields
  Who drop like flakes and falling stars 
  In the dirt of the worst of wars.
  The explanation can only be - 
  She floated out of her body, 
  We call it O B E.

      MY TRUE HOME&nbsp;    by Andy Harley      	

  		  		Drawn into tangible   		darkness,
  		Rushing high speed through a tunnel.
  		I’m somewhere between two worlds
  		Spiraling like water through a funnel.
  		&nbsp;
  		I see a pinpoint of light in the distance,
  		Growing larger the closer I get.
  		But for some strange reason I’m not afraid?
  		And see it not as being a threat.
  		&nbsp;
  		Entering into a realm so soothing
  		Of radiant, golden-white light,
  		Peace and warmth pours over my spirit,
  		It’s so beautifully – beautifully bright.
  		&nbsp;
  		Moving with the flow of fine silk,
  		My translucent body glows;
  		Like thousands of tiny diamonds
  		They sparkle and superimpose.
  		&nbsp;
  		A floodgate of knowledge has been opened,
  		With infinite waves of love;
  		There’s a pageantry of dramatic colors here
  		That just could never be dreamed of?
  		&nbsp;
  		I see miraculous mountains of deep blue velvet
  		And spectacular valleys galore;
  		A waterfall dazzles with clarity and life,
  		This Elysian area I’d love to explore!
  		&nbsp;
  		Drifting next into a garden,
  		With swaying grass so crisp, cool, and green;
  		The luminescent flowers pulsate,
  		Their shades so completely serene;
  		&nbsp;
  		I hear music playing of harmonic beauty
  		That rolls like a glassy river.
  		Enchanting, mystical tones,
  		That would make any man alive shiver.
  		&nbsp;
  		Then suddenly, I see someone in the distance,
  		Coming towards me to reunite.
  		This whistling persons emanating glow,
  		Is such a comforting and glorious sight?
  		&nbsp;
  		When I can finally distinguish who it is,
  		I realize it’s my Grandpap Jack.
  		He tells me that it’s not yet my time,
  		And that I must now . . . go back.
  		&nbsp;
  		I could stay an eternity at this divine place
  		From just these few things that I’ve been shown;
  		But I know one great day for sure I’ll be back,
  		Because I believe this is my true home.
  		
  		   		I was given the   		wonderful opportunity of having my book of 62 poems,   		Till The Dreaming’s     		  		  		Done :   		“Poems Crafted For Thinking People” (ISBN 1-4137-8232-9) published this   		year, and this is actually one of the poems that can be found in my   		book.

  Time     by Paul Long&nbsp;

  Like a river it flows forever

  Changing worlds and men alike

  A great city rots to ruins

  A village becomes an empire

  A fair king sires selfish heirs

  Whilst a rogue begets a saint

  Always changing, always flowing

  Never ending

  Time is moving

  A mountain crumbles into dust

  A forest wastes away

  A beach becomes an ocean floor

  A river carves a canyon

  Time turns heaven into hell

  And the Styx into the Nile

  An enemy becomes a friend

  An ally turns to foe

  Young love grows into devotion

  A child’s dream to a life’s obsession

  People grow

  Life goes on

  All things change

  Like a river it flows forever

&nbsp;A SECOND CHANCE   	by John Yelavich

&nbsp;

The towering pine trees became ever more stately,

thanks to a bounty of golden sunshine and gentle rain.

Pruning the old brittle limbs would make them seem shapely,

and the pinewoods could look healthy and trim once again.

&nbsp;

Smelling the beauty of the pines from my perch up high,

I had a strange feeling that something possibly could go awry.

Those thoughts of uncertainly were casually brushed aside

as I felt secure for that one moment in the treetop I did reside.

&nbsp;

It was dreary and sullen on that fateful day in August of 1998.

In the distant horizon was a northeasterly zephyr

blanketing the sky with a tinge of color the shade of slate

and for a brief moment, my tenure on earth became just a blur.

&nbsp;

The breezes that blew were no longer so gentle

precipitating my fall to the ground as solely accidental.

While lying entwined with the branches I had just clipped

I screamed aloud for anyone whose hand I could grip.

&nbsp;

A host of angels hovered over and greeted me

at a time when my body and soul were set to be free.

Visions of my family and friends glowed like bright lights,

as God's little attendants reached down to tug me off into flight.

&nbsp;

A solitary guardian savior heard my hysteric and desperate pleas;

she opened up my eyes to the wonders I had yet to foresee.

Vowing my heart would be generous till my last dying gasp,

my divine messenger carefully released me from her grasp.

&nbsp;

In some strange way my aborted journey to the hereafter

was for me an epiphany that encouraged me to envision

one’s lifetime should be reveled in and filled with laughter,

showing compassion to others would be my finest decision.

&nbsp;

My renewed spirit has given me many precious blessings.

I’ve learned to love living with all its marvelous trimmings.

I thank that sacred being for asking me to dance,     forever thankful for being bestowed a second chance.    &nbsp;   JLY, 7/11/01

&nbsp;                              NDE POEM           By Janet &quot;Cookie&quot; Baird, NDE#109
                     
          I've seen the Lord firsthand, &amp; reached the Promised Land.
          A near-death tragedy turned into a message from The Lord for me.
          As I drew my last breath, the name ' Jesus ' I heard;
          untitled, yet simple, yet though out me I felt &quot;THE WORD&quot;.....

                    Then           suddenly, I knew the&nbsp; &quot;Pureness of Life&quot;, Aware of all Goodness-never           having know strife.
          I was taken through time, overthrowing it all; Heavens &amp; Universes came           crashing to a fall!!!
          Religions, Governments; visible or not.....turned into ashes-in their           sins did they rot.
          Then did the Truth of all Pureness Within, fade non-existence all memory           of sin.
          True Life Eternal is meant for us all; And now you're award is to pass           along THE CALL. </body>
