  		              		Experience Description   

    Into the hereafter:

  June 23rd, 1979 began like any other travelling day.  I was in St Louis enjoying the last of my leave time before reporting to the 101st at Fort Campbell Ky.  I always wore a helmet while in Missouri, but once I cleared the JB bridge, I pulled over, took the helmet off and put headphones on.  Even then, I felt a bit uneasy.  Couldn't explain it at the time.

  At Murphysboro Il, I was cut off by a teenage driver and broadsided the car.

  Yep, I saw myself laying in the street; kind of like looking down while up in a tree.  Thing was, I was moving up and away from the crash scene.  I remember thinking, 'I need to keep track so I can find my way back.'  Still moving away, the earth was getting smaller and smaller until it and the sun were specks in a sea of a million other specks.  Next thing I can remember is thinking 'where am I going'?  As my soul turned to check my progress I had a sense of profound peace and tranquility like nothing I'd felt before.  I remember shadowy silhouettes around me and sensed 'that the world would be OK without me, I was forgiven for my sins, and love.  Again, I felt a presence and was given a choice, 'go be with God or return to my body so I could be there for my daughter.'  That was kind of a no-brainer, I responded, 'be there for my daughter.'  And, immediately came to while being given mouth to mouth in the street.  Somewhere along the way, I was asked what my name was, and I couldn't remember.  The person asking said,' you probably won't remember anything about this incident.'  I prayed long and hard to be allowed to keep that memory.  There was another instance in the hospital before I was MED-EVACed to Denver.  Again, I left my body, moved through the walls and ceiling; but don't remember another trip to the afterlife.  I've told this story dozens of times over the years.  About 50% don't believe me, and 50% that do believe me; and for them, I hope it gives them some peace after the loss of a loved one.  Normally, these folks are tearing up.

  The non-believers usually say, 'it was a head injury and you were hallucinating.'  I could believe that,,, but,,, remember in the opening paragraph, I said I normally took my helmet off in Illinois?  I did just that.  As I rode south on route 3, I like to say, 'my guardian angel was kicking me on the head and shoulders.'  The closer to Murphysboro I got, the worse it got.  There was a roadside park right after I turned off of 3 onto 149, so I stopped, smoked a cigarette, and checked the bike.  Couldn't find anything wrong, so I got back on the road.  A mile from town, the feeling was so strong, I reached back, got my helmet off of the back rest and put it on.  1/4 mile out, I had it snapped on.  There was a gas station at the edge of town that I had gotten gas at before; I'm sure I was checking to see if it was crowded.  I had just enough warning to brace myself (the foot-pegs and handlebars were bent forward) and I know I put my right side into the car much like a block in football.    By the way, remember that presence that gave me a choice to be with God or be there for my daughter?  Well, Shirley was pregnant, but we didn't know it was going to be a girl.  And to validate that choice; Misty was birthed, the folks in the delivery cleaned her up, I got to cut the umbilical and then she was handed to me to be put on the scale.  As I bent to put her on the scale, her eyes opened wide, she smiled at me, and gave me a coo as if to say, 'good choice dad.'

  So, there are 2 solid pieces of evidence here that cemented my belief that God was on my side that day.  Putting that helmet on where I normally didn't wear one; and being there for Misty.

  Bear in mind the odds of that incident happening with all of the variables.  1.  Leaving St Louis at the time I did.  2.  The first stop to remove my helmet and that feeling of foreboding.  3.  The second stop, to check the bike.  4. Putting the helmet on when I did.  Factor in speed, traffic, weather etc.  Devine intervention?
