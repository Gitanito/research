I was out raking leaves around ten or eleven that morning. After about a half an hour, my chest became very tight. I thought nothing of it and went in to house to take my inhaler. I took two puffs and began to feel better. I went back outside and resumed raking. Within about ten minutes, my lungs started to close up even faster. I told my mom and went inside to my bedroom. I tried to take my inhaler again, but I knew I needed to go to the hospital. I realized that I was too far gone and couldn't get to my mother. She then came into the house and I could barely call to her. She came to my room and knew we needed to get me medical attention. My brother and she tried to help me stand, but something told me that I was dying and I saw a brief glimpse of white and was unconscious. My mother said that my eyes closed and I began to drool and could not speak words only mutter yes and no. I was put in the back seat of the car. My brother was instructed to keep telling me to breath. I never heard anything. About halfway to the hospital, I took a very loud rattled breath and completely stopped breathing. My mother panicked and stopped the car. Someone ended up stopping and he threw me in the back of his truck. In the back of his truck, I lost all body functions and vomited on myself.

When I was brought to the emergency room, the staff debated whether I could be saved or not. In the meantime, I was in a state I could not describe. I was floating in complete darkness. I was aware of my surroundings. I felt well-rested, relaxed and happy. I do not know how long I was in that state. Finally, I felt something pull me.  The next thing I knew, all these people were standing over me. I was asked my name and to spell it. I was totally confused. I had forgotten what had happened to me. They told me that they thought that a bug had stung me. I remembered then and began to tell them what drugs I already taken and they told me it was too late. They had already fixed me up. I started to feel a burning on my arms. I looked down and saw three IVs in one arm and two in the other. The doctor tried to explain to me that I was a DOA (dead on arrival). I didn't want to believe him. Each of the nurses came in and congratulated me on ' defeating death'. I went home at about two that afternoon.

Background Information:

Gender:	 Female

  NDE Elements:

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Yes         Respiratory arrest.

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?       No

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.    I did not hear anything usual at the time.

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?       No

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?       Yes     I do not remember 'seeing' any beings, but I know that something communicated with me. My head was filled with all kinds of information, like religious issues. Reincarnation was another and the 'age of our souls'. I think that there was a lot more, but it seems like it is buried.

Did you see an unearthly light?       Yes   Right before I went unconscious I saw flashes of gentle white light.

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?       A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     I was in a dimension that was neither here nor there. I think that it was like a waiting room or it covers images that are maybe too intense for me. That is my theory.

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?       Everything about the universe     After the NDE, I had a sense of reincarnation. Each soul is a certain age and that we have certain lessons to learn in this life. When we fail at our lessons, we come back to live another life and try to learn them. Also, that religion is a ladder of a soul's maturity. Each religion is a sort of school grade. It was not revealed to me which religion is kindergarten or the senior class. I also came back with such a deep inner sadness over the lack of compassion in the world. I still am affected by that.

Did scenes from your past come back to you?       My past flashed before me, out of my control

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       No       

     After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      No

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       Yes

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     No

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No
