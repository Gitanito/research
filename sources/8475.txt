NDE  Medical Explicability Controversy by Dr. Jeff, 1/20/02    
  Home Page  Current NDEs  Share NDE</span>     	</tr>      Greetings!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     I am Dr. Jeff.&nbsp;     I shared my views regarding near-death experience (NDE) with you on the    recent ABC news broadcast.&nbsp;  Obviously,    neither of us were given sufficient time to expand on our perspectives on NDE.&nbsp;     If you are agreeable, I would be delighted to learn more about your    perspective of NDE.        </o:p>

My    interest in NDE began over a decade ago when I heard a remarkable NDE from a    friend, and recalled an article regarding NDE I encountered in JAMA (JAMA .&nbsp;1980    Jul 4;244(1):29-30).&nbsp;  Largely to    personally explore NDE, I published a web site devoted to NDE (www.nderf.org).&nbsp;     Subsequently, I became quite active in IANDS (International Association    for Near-Death Studies, www.iands.org).&nbsp;     There are a number of NDE physician researchers, and virtually none of    us are able to convince ourselves of a plausible medical explanation of NDE.&nbsp;     This is consistent with the conclusion of the recent study in The    Lancet.&nbsp;  Consistent NDE    observations that seem medically inexplicable to me include, but are not    limited to:

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     The common observation that NDErs can see or hear events going on    around them while unconscious or clinically without vital signs.&nbsp;     In my investigation of over 250 NDEs shared with my web site,    approximately 40% described such visual or auditory perceptions.&nbsp;     In my investigation, there was only one instance where the contributor    confirmed what they saw during the experience to be false. This single report    involved perceptions at the end of the NDE, where virtually all others had    this component of the NDE at the beginning of the experience.&nbsp;     In scores of other NDE accounts the accuracy of perceptions while    unconscious were checked by the experiencer.&nbsp;     These perceptions were consistently found to be accurate, and often    very detailed.&nbsp;  This finding has    been collaborated by a large number of other investigators in many    retrospective studies and one prospective study.        </o:p>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     There is a remarkable consistency of elements of the experience among    NDErs.&nbsp;  These elements involve    experiences not typically a part of daily life and include, but are not    limited to, telepathic communication, life review, encountering deceased    relatives as opposed to individuals currently living, and a marked lucidness    of the experience.&nbsp;  A common    sentiment among NDErs was expressed by one NDEr saying the experience was 'far    more conscious than humanly normal.'&nbsp;  When    asked directly if the experience was dreamlike in any way, virtually all NDErs    polled on our web site answered no.&nbsp;  The    overwhelming majority of NDE accounts we received (including at least three    from physicians) felt the experience was real and meaningful.&nbsp;     The great majority of NDErs have no significant doubts about the    reality of the NDE. &nbsp;             </b>

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     There are several dozen cases of NDEs occurring in blind individuals,    including those blind from birth.&nbsp;  70-80%    of these individuals have visual NDEs.&nbsp;  I    personally encountered a NDE account from an individual with a congenital    inability to smell, who smelled a rose during their experience.&nbsp;     There are accounts of deaf individuals with auditory NDEs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     There is a consistency of changed beliefs and attitudes following NDE    that is partially described in The Lancet article.&nbsp;     These findings by The Lancet study are collaborated by multiple    retrospective studies by other NDE investigators.&nbsp;     The great majority of NDErs describe significant life changes following    the experience.        </o:p>

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Those    proposing medical explanations of NDE in the past have not been able to find    consensus regarding a single or several plausible biological, physiologic or    psychological alternative explanations for NDE.&nbsp;     This explains the large number (over 20 at last count) of varied    alternative explanations for NDE.&nbsp;  The    Lancet study, by far the largest prospective study of NDE, found the    occurrence of NDE was not associated with the duration of cardiac arrest or    unconsciousness, medication or fear of death before cardiac arrest.        </b></o:p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     The preceding are some of the major issues regarding NDE that lead me    to conclude NDE is medically inexplicable.&nbsp;     I am always interested in learning about the ideas and perspectives of    others on this important issue.&nbsp;  Anything    you wish to share regarding your own views on NDE would be greatly    appreciated!        </o:p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Respectfully,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Dr. Jeff, M.D.
