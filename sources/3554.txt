    Summary: &nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Phoenix, The.

 An Illustrated Review of Occultism and Philosophy.

 1931-1960?  Irregular

 Los Angeles, CA.  Publisher: Hall Pub. Co..  Editor: Manly Palmer Hall.

 1/1, 1931.  16x24, hardcover.  Another beautifully designed production of Manly Palmer Hall (1901-1990).  See the note on him under The All-Seeing Eye.   This seems to have been intended as a regular journal, but only infrequent "editions" of it were published  over the years, the fourth in 1960.  The journal contained long and thoughtful articles on Bodhidharma, Albert Pike, the Comte de St.-Germain, H.P. Blavatsky ("The Russian Sphinx"), etc., most accompanied by photographs or drawings.
