  		              		Experience Description   

    On 11/20/2019, I woke up because I was having severe nausea,  and an aching in my left arm and lower left chest area.  I figured it was food poisoning. But maybe not, because  during my three years in Denver I had food poisoning between 6 - 10 times. I  don't remember the exact number of times, but I did go back to sleep.  I woke up three more times with the last event being about 2:00 a.m.   I could not stand the pain any longer as my left arm was aching so badly, I wanted to cut it off.   I was too weak to stand up anymore.  I yelled at Valerie to start the car and get ready to take me to the hospital.  I was overwhelmed from the pain, and had to lay down on the bathroom floor. I was too weak to get up.  
  
  During this time, I prayed for Christ to forgive and save me as I believed I was dying.  Valerie came in and wanted to take my blood pressure. Somehow, I managed to get up and sit on my knees.  The pain increased immediately and I fell back down.  I thought that dying  wouldn't be as painful as it was now.  Valerie went upstairs to get Larry and Vanetta to help get me to my feet and into the car. This wasn't working, so   Vanetta yelled to get an ambulance.   

  Within  3 to 4 minutes, the EMT/paramedic was asking me about  my pain level. I told him it was a 9 or 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the highest pain.  I was cold,  sweating, thirsty, and exhausted.    The EMT gave me  baby aspirin and told me to, 'Chew them up right now.'  I couldn't move and told him that.    He responded, 'SIR YOU HAVE TO CHEW THEM UP RIGHT NOW!'  I forced myself to take the aspirin and was filled with strength. I stood up.  I felt  compelled to stand. Unfortunately, I felt SEVERE pain again in my chest and left arm.  The Paramedics got me into a chair apparatus and strapped me down for the movement to the ambulance.  From there,   I was helped onto the gurney and placed into the ambulance.      The paramedics cut off my shirt and placed two IVs in my arms.  Then we drove 3 miles to the hospital. I told the EMT that the pain was getting much worse.

  Suddenly, I was in a new place. I knew I was COMPLETELY and WHOLLY in this place and it was perfect.  I knew I was COMPLETELY ME without a body.    I was aware that every action, situation, event, or decision I had made  in my life was vivid and recallable, and all was and is me.  I became aware of a bright light up and slightly towards my left.  The light was infinitely brighter than anything I could ever imagine.  It was so bright that initially, I had tried to turn my face away from it.   I was in the light without shadow or explanation.  I also knew that this place was perfect.  The temperature was perfect.  I also knew that the light was infinitely more powerful than the universe as this was the energy that created the universe. There were colors and shimmering coming from around the edges of the light although there really were no edges as the light  filled the entire area and permeated my very being.

  I thought, 'Thank God I was able to pray and ask forgiveness before I got here as this is why I am here!'   I had a deep knowing, 'It is not about what you have done.  Christ accomplished this and it was for you and for all.  You are safe.'  I wished I could explain this transference of knowledge to me, but it is beyond description.  In my soul and in my very being, I knew I was safe. I knew I was me and that God had absolute knowledge of where I was, what I was, who I am, and was with me in this place.   

  The instant I was in Heaven, or rather the outskirts of it, time stopped.  I did not have the knowledge of time as we do here on earth.  I also did not have the NEED TO SURVIVE, to live, to draw the next breath.  The survival instinct was gone. I was safe and totally at peace.

  I looked away from the light, and smelled pure cotton linen.  Of note here is that I lost my sense of smell about 6 years ago.  On earth, I can't even smell gasoline. Yet here in this place,  I was astounded and surprised since I was well aware that I could not smell.  I saw a glimpse of a material in front of me and it looked distant to me and I was unable to discern or see what it was.  I moved forward  and was able to just glimpse a pattern of linen that was intricately woven.  As I glimpsed this pattern in the linen, I knew everything about the line; such as  the string used to make the weave and the act of making the linen weave. I knew that   every part of the creation of this linen had been performed perfectly from pure, untainted materials.  

    Suddenly, I was returned to my body and I saw the EMT through my own eyes.  I felt intense pain and anguish.  Time restarted for me and I noted the passing of precious seconds as we traveled to the hospital.    I asked the EMT,  'Was I out?'   He replied,   'You coded sir.  Do you remember anything?'  I was in too much pain to say anything else.
