  		              		Experience Description   

    At first there was a great void.  Then I perceived a hazy light somewhere off in the distance.  I swam toward it.  Details began to emerge and I perceived a landscape that was sort of a combination of cave formations (stalagmites and stalactites) and someone's colon. A little further on these details became clearer and I found myself in a cenote, or underwater cave.  But I wanted out.  As I was reaching the light at the border between the watery world and air, I heard my name.  As I became lucid I think I coughed to get the water out, but my memory may have added this detail later.

Uncertain      CPR given   complete heart block (no forewarning)  Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function)   Heart rate dropped and I passed out.

Did you feel separated from your body?      No    I lost awareness of my body

I was clearly on an uphill path, straight with no turns.  The light wasn't directly above me but angled up at maybe a 75⁰ angle.

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Slight changes in my life     my husband and I try harder than before to live life to the fullest. We have been limited due to Covid, but we have increased travel plans, since that is something we both enjoy together that would be sort of sad on our own.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I remember that I was in no hurry to get to the light until I heard my name called.  Then I sped up.

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?

But I question why my mind might have situated the tunnel under water, in a landscape I have never seen.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    almost immediately, in the moments I was waiting for the ambulance gurney, I told my husband and the first responder.

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     it hasn't changed.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     I'm not sure what to make of it.  Perhaps the watery world was an indicator that my body was starved for oxygen.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         no  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Question 30 needs another option.  Was there a border, a point of no return?  Yes but I didn't make a conscious decision to live.  I wasn't aware that I was on the brink between life and death. I didn't question why I was finding myself in this place. There was just a boundary ahead and I was goal oriented to get to it.  No desperation, just a job to do.
