we have one of our witnesses with the
Lockheed skunkworks
scientist and you know what skunkworks
are you know the super-secret skunk
works up in the high desert were been
rich he wrote the book skunk works and
before he passed away he&#39;s the one who
said well as he said several things one
thing he said there are no private
conversations anywhere on earth this was
in the 90s so he was way ahead of Edward
Snowden number two anything you can
imagine we&#39;ve already done at the skunk
works and number three we already have
the technologies to go travel amongst
the stars in fact we can take e.t home
and the last thing he did and his slide
was to show this this black disc going
out into space and it was a it was a
human it was a book it was a man-made
electromagnetic or Vedic EMG
anti-gravity disk which they have and
which we have had since October 1954
when we mastered gravity control so but
the the more profound thing is that
people who&#39;ve studied this begin to have
experiences that are very very strange
because you can take these electronics
and create this lifter effect of
anti-gravity so they they&#39;re called
lifters and the way it is done is that
you at a high enough voltage with a
counter rotating field you can cause
lift and this is if you go all the way
back to the experiments of T Townsend
Brown who of course ended up being the
guy out the starting of the RAND
Corporation this stuff went to the Air
Force went black or the colossi frost
experiment in 1920 late 20s in Germany
they were doing things with crystalline
structures and they would create a high
voltage field around them and found that
especially with crystals they would kind
of begin to resonate and expand grow or
take up more space and then they&#39;d float
and lift twenties
19:29 mean before any of us were I
suspect between before any of us were
alive I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyone here
was alive in the 28:29 time period not
even I but so we have this amazing
heritage that unfortunately has been
confiscated into covert programs but the
people that I&#39;ve dealt with I now have
five hundred five hundred people I&#39;ve
met with like the guys at Lockheed
skunkworks and Northrop and the agency&#39;s
three literary agencies who shared this
with me and the senior scientists here
and then they were research labs in DC
which is a largest Department of Defense
lab was in quote the vault and saw the
documents at October 1954 is when we
completed all the studies for gravity
control so we haven&#39;t needed Rockets
jets cars trains buses trucks ships on
the ocean using combustible fuels or
nuclear power since October 1954 now it
was being studied before them for a
couple decades but it was mastered
that&#39;s when they mastered gravity
control and what a shame it is you look
at the world and we&#39;re destroying the
world
geo politically and environmentally and
every other way because of this secrecy
and the secrecy is something that I
understand but do not agree with you
have to understand it you don&#39;t have to
agree with it and I understand it in a
compassionate way I mean I talked to the
colonel who was in charge of future
technologies for the Air Force euphemism
for not future things we already have
it&#39;s always a doublespeak when you deal
with the military so this guy knew about
this and he said you know those things
can be weaponized I said yes you already
have
they&#39;re already weaponized I said I
can&#39;t tell you how many patients I took
care of in the emergency department who
were killed with knives steak knives
butter knives in kill everything I said
everything can be weaponized the
question is do we let human society
terminate fighting over the last barrel
of oil
destroying the biosphere or do we find a
way to live together peacefully in an
enforceable peace maybe it may be the
piece of the chain dogs initially
because they&#39;re always gonna be Mad Men
out there but allow these Sciences to
come out so we don&#39;t cannibalize the
earth because we&#39;re 100 years into a
period when all of everything I&#39;m
telling you should have been known and
out at least in terms of the theoretical
physics the applied free energy
materials should have been out and by
the turn of the last century early 1900s
and the electromagnetic curve etics 50s
40s and 50s which of course Wernher von
Braun was working on with Adolf Hitler
in Germany that was their secret weapon
we were doing the atomic bomb they were
doing anti-gravity but we have this
period in our in our history right now
where we&#39;ve sort of gone past the red
line of disclosure where we should have
had these things disclosed and it put
into peaceful application before I was
born
because I was born in 1955 so I think
that when we look at this we have to say
you know it&#39;s a little bit like a Gloria
Steinem when she used to say that the
truth will set you free the first it
will piss you off love it but we&#39;re at
this point we&#39;re gonna have to decide
them to make these changes but first we
have to understand what we&#39;re dealing
with here
and we really have to begin to
understand the power of the conscious
mind and these technologies and how they
come together because when we&#39;re out
there making contact with these
civilizations we&#39;re actually pulling
together amazing science and technology
even though you may not fully understand
but the things that are happening are
amazing and therefore the phenomena that
can happen are amazing and that&#39;s why
you need this understanding the
scientific and intellectual
understanding to understand the
experience you will have or may have
already had and didn&#39;t understand what
happened when you
had it like when you had that at the
Outer Banks that&#39;s why the you know the
men who&#39;ve worked in these projects and
some of the women like this guy at the
Lockheed skunkworks he he knew about
some of this but not all of it he knew
more about though there&#39;s just a more
mainline anti-gravity stuff or
electromagnetic wave it ik because
that&#39;s the proper term anti-gravity sort
of a pop-culture term it&#39;s incorrect
it&#39;s not anti-gravity it just creates a
mass cancellation effect of an object so
it floats and if you cancel the mass
enough think about it if you create a
voltage around an object where the mass
becomes less and less and less what
happens when the mass goes to zero it
disappears
correct it vanishes to the eye and all
detection systems and it&#39;s in moved into
another dimension and it&#39;s in that state
that it goes from this star system to
another one get it does this make sense
to people now I&#39;m this is beginning that
makes sense so when these pilots and
people come to me with the experience
now they&#39;re gonna come with an empirical
observation and they don&#39;t have the
background I will try to explain to them
what why that 747 and this massive craft
went from here to here and look like it
vanished and or the one that&#39;s going on
your wingtip was hovering there and all
your instruments were going nuts on
board and it just D materialized and
vanished it&#39;s there&#39;s nothing
metaphysical about it it&#39;s a actual hard
science so very well understood hard
science but it&#39;s not something you can
take it of course in MIT so this is your
MIT course so for now for now someday
you know this will be mainstream
education I hope soon maybe not soon but
it the sooner the better the bet you
know over there the kids coming along
need to understand this this particular
scientist getting back to his experience
the reason he called me up was not to
tell me about the time he was operating
a radar system and an ET craft came in
and did all this amazing stuff which is
in the disclosure book it was that
had an experience that he didn&#39;t
understand personal experience this is
why a lot of these guys end up getting
in touch with nice very funny and I go
okay so I&#39;m on the phone I think he hurt
me on a radio show or something or and
so he says well doc I was practicing a
meditation discipline back in the 60s
called Rory secretions or somebody we
have the Rosicrucian and he was trying
to learn how to what they call astrally
project where your body of light and
consciousness sort of lifts up out of
your physical body and flies around like
a lucid flying dream but sort of on
command instead of accidentally and I so
cool you ever have any success with that
he says yes let me tell you and he says
but it has to do with this issue I said
oh really
and so he said well I was there and I
was trying too hard he wasn&#39;t relaxing
deeply enough and so his teacher one day
said look you know how to do this you
just need to let go and let it happen
and I guess teach it the right thing was
said to him so he was able to do it so
he laid down on his bed and he was doing
whatever techniques they use I&#39;ve never
taken that course but he went out of his
body lifted up and initially just kind
of lifted up and then he just he got so
excited went right up stood through the
roof the ceiling of the house and into
the sky and into the atmosphere and then
slammed into the side of an
extraterrestrial vehicle he&#39;s fully
lucid awake and he said that he said
that the the ETS on board which were
around four or five feet tall and very
thin no hey no here were at some
controlling they were observing and they
were they were hovering in the
atmosphere but not visible to the eye
because they were shifted into this
other dimension and he when he hit the
spacecraft the craft moved but it was
not his physical body it was his astral
body that the body of light that you fly
around in he says I don&#39;t understand how
an interstellar vehicle was he knew they
existed
could be affected I said because it had
shifted its resonant frequency beyond
the crossing point of light the speed of
light and matter and electrons into a
dimension that is closely approximates
the astral body field that energy field
that the Mystics called astral and since
it was of a similar density to your own
it could interface with it the funniest
part of the story after he said oh I&#39;ve
wondered my whole life how that could
have happened he popped inside and they
looked at him like my god why don&#39;t you
watch where you&#39;re going you know as
other mm-hmm
they did it was like it&#39;s kind of like
appalled at this interstellar faux pas
and like making me watch where you&#39;re
going
you
