In ihort, when-has Europe been fo inundated
and. oyerwhehned with fanaticifm,.aa in our .
age ?
. Who has not. heard of the devils of Lorn-
dun ? of hobgoblins, fylphs, convulfionaries,
magnetifts, and cabalifts ? What is the objaft
of the free mafons,' and thofe phrenetic focieties
called the Illuminated, with their plots, their*
fecrets, their invocations, and their ridiculous
rites ?
It is a juft obfervation, that impoftors ac­
quire credit and renown only in thofe countries
where there is but little religion, and much
philofophy. Rome is not a capital in which
fuch men can hope to fucceed, becaufe error will
not be permitted to fpread forth its branches in
' the centre of the true faith. The life of Count
Caglioftro is aluminous proof of the juftice of
our obfervation ; and this is the reafon why we
have thought it our duty to compofe this

on this occaiion been employed in dtfpenfing

We beg leave to conclude with obferv-
ing, that we would much rather have pre­
ferred eternal filence on this fubjeft, than now
report a Angle circumftance as a fa£t, the

mean extra&ion, was born at * Palermo, on the
eighth
* In a memoir publifhed by the Count whilein England,
he pretended that he could not fpeak pofitively as to the
place of his nativity, nor in regard to the parents from whom
he derived his birth. This circumilance gave an ample
icope to the imagination of his followers; fome of whom
pretended that he was the [offspring of the grand mailer

eighth of June 1743. . His father, who had
been a merchant, happening to die during his
infancy, his maternal uncles took him under
their prote&ion, and endeavoured to inftrudt
him in the principles of religion, and give him
an education fuitable to his years. But from his
earlieft infancy he fhewed himfelf fo averfe to
a virtuous courfe of life, that he fled more than
once from the feminary of St. Roch at Pa­
lermo, where he had been placed for his in-
flrudtion. '
At the age of thirteen he was entrufted tot
the care ofthe father-general ofthe G o o d - B r o t b e r -
b o c d ^ t who carried him to the conyent_of that
order at Cartagirone. There he put on the ha­
bit of a novice ; and, being plated under the
tuition of the apothecary, he learned from him
longing to that ifland; while others, with equal probability,
affirmed*that he was the only furviving ion of that prince
who about thirty-five years ago fwayed the precarious
feeptreof Trcbifond. To infufe into this fiory a greater
, portion of the marvellous, it was added, that a revolution
taking place, in confequence of which the reigning fovereign
was facrificed to the fury of his feditious fubjefts, bis in-*
fant ion, the Coiint Caglioftro, was conveyed by a truily
friend to Medina, where the Muflulman Sherif had the
unprejudiced generofity to educate him in the faith of his
Chriftian parents. T .

^according to his own eonfeffíon) the firft prin­
ciples of chemiftry and medicine.
He did not continue long in this afylum;
during his flay* however* he exhibited fo many
new fymptoms o f a vicious diara&er, that the
religious were often under the neceflity ofehaf-
tiftng him. It is recorded among other things*
that, being employed to read during meals, as
is euftomary in all holy communities, he would
never repeat what appeared in the book; but,on
the contrary, fpoke whatever occurred to his own
imagination 1 nay, he has even confelled that*
in reading the Martyrology, he ufed to fubfti-
tute the names of the moft famous Courtezans
of the time, inftead of thofe of the faints.
In fíne, to get rid of the mortifications and
the penance infli&ed upon him, on account of
his faults, he abandoned his convent, and re­
turned to Palermo. '
It was about this period that he cultivated a
tafte for drawing: but this neither occafioned
a change in his morals, or his conduft. The
exceffes to which he abandoned himfelf were
almoft of every kind and defeription. Deliver­
ing himfelf entirely up to his paffion for fenc­
ing, and to the company of the moft difiblute
young men of the neighbourhood, there was
no quarrel in which he did not take a part: but

above all things he took a particular pleafure
in refilling the officers ofjuftice, and in deliver­
ing from their hands the prifoners whom they
had arrefted. He was alfo accufed of having
forged tickets of admiflion into the theatre m
r
and he dole from one of his uncles with whom
he lived, a confiderable quantity pf money,
andfeveral valuable effeib. Having encou­
raged an' amorous intercourfe between an ac­
quaintance and one of hisfemale coufins, he car­
ried^billet-doux from one to the other; and, pro-
fitingby this opportunity,made the lover believe
that the young lady fometimes requefted mo­
ney, -and fometimes a watch of a trinket: thef©
prefents were accordingly confided to his care,
and clandeftinely appropriated to h'is own ufe.
Such was his addrefs, that he infinuated him—
felf into the good graces of a relation who was
a notary, and aftually found means to falfify a
teftament in favour of a certain Marquis Mau­
rigi, by which means great injury accrued to a
pious eftablifliment. This piece of roguery
was difcovered fcveral years after, at a time
when he was abfent from Palermo; and proof*
were adduced on the occafion that clearly ma-
nifefted his criminality. It has allb been af-
fcrted that he aflailinated a canon} and it is pre­
tended that, having been applied to by a monk

to procure leave of abfence from his fuperior,
he forged a permiffion, on purpofe to cheat the
-holy father out of a little money.
• This much is however certain, that be was
frequently feized and imprifoned: but it fo
happened that he always regained his liberty ip
-a Ihort time, either from the want of neceifory
proofs for his convi&ion, on account of.thp
¡nature of the crime, or by means o f the credit
and intercefikm of his relations. A t length he
wras forced to.fly from his country for haying
duped a goldfmith, of the name of Marano, o f
more than, fixty pieces o f gold. H aving inge­
nuity fufEcienc to make this iimpleton believe
that he had an immenfe treafure concealed in p
grotto, in a diftant part of,the country, of whjcfr
he would put him in poffefllon; he, under tb
t^
B
pretence, procured the above-mentioned fura,
which, as he pretended, was to be employed in
certain magical operations. This comedy how,-
ever concluded very little to the advantage o f
poor Marano, for he was fevercly beaten by
certain people who appeared to him in the
ihape of infernal fpirits. T he truth is, that
thefe inhabitants of Pandemonium were no
other than the companions of Balfamo, who
afted in concert with him, and afiumed this
difguife at his recommendation.

• Marano havingdifcovered the trick, was ex-t
tremely .irritated, as may very readily be be­
lieved ; and, not content with laying an informa­
tion of the particulars before a magiftrate, he
determined to revenge his wrongs, by affafii-
nating the author of them. It was this that del*
termined Balfamo to fly from his native^coun­
try. - ' • • • • • .
A variety of circumftances which occurred
from this period till the time o f his laft imprl-
•fonment, have given grounds to: believe that
he pra&ifed forcery. This fuppofuion is
founded on the two following anecdotes. T h e
firft is, that, under pretence of preparing a re­
medy for one of his fifters, who v/zsptjejed, he
made a country pried: adminifter a little cotton
to her, which had been fteeped in the holy oil
which is ufed for extreme umftion.. It is how­
ever well known that he never, had a lifter who
was pojfejfed. ’The other, which is rather re­
markable, is as follows : It is pretended that,
being one day in company with feveral of his
friends, they teftified a great curiofity to dif-
cover what a certain lady of their acquaintance
was doing at that very moment. Balfamo
offers to fatisfy their inclinations: he accord­
ingly forms a fquare on the ground, waves his
hand over it, and then draws the figyre of the
• lady

lady playing at. cards with three of; her ac­
quaintance. On this they ihilantly ferid Co her
houfe, and find that file was- actually fitting-in
the lame attitude, employed in the very occu­
pation, and. in company with the fame perfons
whom he had delineated. By. means of the
cireumftances which we ihall hereafter relate,
it will be eafy to determine what degree of*
credibility fliould be given to this event,, and
what are the conclufions which ought to be
drawn from it.
Balfamo being obliged to fly from Palermo,
gave himfelf up to a wandering life^ and ae-
tually travelled through mod parts o f the
world : we are henceforth obliged to give cre­
dit to his own afiertions until his arrival in
Rome, becaufe we have no other opportunity
o f tracing his hiftory, or of verifying any of the
particulars.
By means o f the money which he had pro­
cured in the manner already related, he now
repaired to Medina. There he got acquainted
with a certain perfon of the name of Altotas : .
it is not known with certainty whether he was a
Spaniard or a Greek, for he could fpeak both pf
thefe languages with fiuency. H e was in pof-
ieflion of fevcral Arabic manuferipts, and pre­
tended to be a great chemift. H aving em­

barked together on boárd of a vittel, they
failed alorig the Archipelago, and landed at
Alexandria in E gypt, where during the fpace of
forty days they performed feveral operations
in chemiftry, by which they procured a great
deal of money.
They propofed to pafs from thence to Grand
Cairo ; but they were driven by contrary winds
to the iQand o f Malta. THfcre they remained
for lome time, and worked in the laboratory of
the grand matter Pinto. Altotas * having died
foon after, Balfamo refolved to vifit Naples,
and accordingly put himfelf under the protec-
• tion of a knight of Malta, to whom l>e was re­
commended by the grand matter.
H e fuppOrted himfelf for feme time in that
capital with the money which had been pre-
fented to him by the grand matter, and the pre-

Arrived in the capital o f the Chriftian world,
Balfamo aflumed feveral different chara&ers,
and appealed fometimes in an ecckfiaftical, and
fometimes in a fecular habit. By means of
letters o f recommendation which he had pro­
cured at Naples, he obtained accefs to feveral
perfons of diftin£tion * : among others he got ac­

abode at the fign.o/.the Sun, in the neighbour­
hood of the Rotunda,, he happened to quarrel
w ith one of the waiters, in confequence o f
•which he was irriprifoned for three days.
. It was about this time that he happened to
fee the young Lorenza Feliciani, who lived
near to the Three Pilgrims. H e foon became
exceedingly attached to this young woman,
and aiked her parents confent to make her his
•wife : this was accordingly granted, and he re­
ceived, as a dower, a trifling fortune, propor­
tionate to their condition. T h e marriage was
folemnized in the parifh church o f $t. Saviour
in the Fields, and the bridegroom lodged with
his father-in-law for fome months after.
The firft leflons which the young bride re­
ceived from hçr huiband, were intended, ac­
cording to her own confeiflon, to inftruit her
. in the means of attracting and gratifying thç
•pleafures of the other fex. The moft wanron
coquetry and the moft lafcivious arts were the
.principles with which he endeavoured to infpire
her. The mother of Lorenza, fcandalized at
this conduit, had fpch frequent altercations
'with her fon-in-law concerning his behaviour,
that he refolved to remove from her houfe.

corrupt the mind and the morals of his wife. H e
then prefenced her to^two perfonswell qualified
for the exercife of her talents, after having firft
iflftru&ed her to entangle them both by her
allurements. W ith one of thefe flae did not fuc-
ceed; but over the other Ihe acquired a com­
plete vidlory. H e himfelf conduced her to the
very fpot dcftined for the pleafures of the lover;
left her alone in his company, and retired into
another chamber. , •
The interview and the offers made to her
were fuch as were entirely cdrrefpondent to the
wifhes of the huibandj but the wife on.this
occafion did not exhibit a proper inftance of
conjugal obedience. She foon after imparted
the whole affair in confidence to her huiband,
and received nothing in return but the moft
"bitter reproach, and the moft violent and
dreadful menaces. It was then that he began
to infinuate this maxim, which he afterwards
fo afiiduoufly repeated: “ That adultery is no
crime in a womah who commits it on account
of her intereft, and not limply through affe&ion
to another man.” .
H e even added example to precept, by prow

courfe of our hiftoryj we will only mention here
that on thefe occafions he aroufed his dormant
paflions by drinking a certain Egyptian wine,
compofed of aromatics, which poflefled all the
qualities neceifary for the completion of his in­
tentions.
His wife having at length begun to hearken
• to his inftru&ions, he conduced1 her two or
three times to the place where (he had formerly
been fo difobedient to his orders. She fome-
times received clothes, fometimes trinkets,
and fometimes a little money, as the reward o f
her condefcenfion. O ne day the huiband
wrote a letter in his wife’s name to the lover
whom he had forced her to receive, in which
he begged the loan of a few crowns, which were
immediately fent: in return for thefe, he pro-
mifed an interview in the courfe of next day,
and the lady was faithful to the appointment.
Balfamo having frequently changed his place
o f abod^ about this time, formed many new ac­
quaintance ; and, among others, cultivated an
intimacy with Otcavio Nicaftro, a perfon well
known on account of having afterwards Hniihed
his exigence at the gibbet, as an accomplice in
an afiafiination; and alfo with another celebrated
adventurer, called the Marquis Agliata : both
of thefe were Sicilians. The character of the

Marquis had a ftrqpg refemblance to that o f ou#
hero. During the time of their intimacy toge­
ther, they were frequently perceived to .be Ihuc
up in a chamber, where they remained a long
time without any third perfon whatever. A bout
what they were occupied is not precifely known 5
but more than one perfon has been heard to
affirm that they were one day feed to iflue from
the place of conference* the Marquis holding
two bills in his hand ; which, after having com­
pared together, he prefented to Balfamo,
telling him at the fame time that it was im -
poflible to do any thing better. Balfamo
himfelf has not attempted to deny the fuperior
genius of bis friend in all things that regarded
the counterfeiting of writing, and the imitation
of feals: adding, that this extraordinary noble­
man had prefented him with a patent as an officer
in the fervice of the king of Prulfia, in which
he himfelf pretended to be a colonel; and had
forged the fignature of that prince with a won­
derful degree of accuracy. Thus authorized
by letters patent from the head of the illuitrious
houfe of Brandenbourg, Balfamo aftually af-
fumed the uniform of one of the Pruffian regi­
ments.

Cure may be fairly attributed to what has been
reported by Balfamo’s own father-in-law. N i-
caftro having quarrelled with his friends, molt
probably about a divifion o f the booty, pre­
fenced himfelf to the officers o f the police, ac-
cured them o f having forged feveral bonds, and
offered to give evidence againft them. There •
is reafon to believe that this treachery having
been difeovered by Agliata and his compa­
nion, they determined inftantly to leave the:
capital of the Roman dominions.
They accordingly departed in two feparate
carriages ; the wife of Balfamo being feated in
that which contained the Marquis, and the
hufband in the other, along with the fecretary
o f Agliata. .
Balfamo has confeffed, without any reluctance,
how little the conjugal vows were refpeCted
during this journey, which was entirely at the
expence of his titled companion. H aving taken
the road to Venice, by Loretto, they arrived
at Bergamo; and while on the road committed a
great number of rogueries: among others,Cagli-
oftro and Agliata, after having ihut themfelves
up for fome time without the knowledge or
intervention of any perl'on, are reported to have
fabricated letters of introduction, which af­

and, after undergoing the neceflary examina­
tions, were baniihed from the city. Agliata
had the good fortune to efcape. A t the mo­
ment that the officers of juilice feized the huf^
band, he had fufficient addrefs to convey a frnall
packet of bills to his wife, which he conjured
her to deftroy, on purpofe to fave his life. She
accordingly concealed them in her bofom, and
took the firft opportunity of tearing them to
pieces. She obferved, on this occafion, that
the bills were written on (lamped paper. W e

Was not intimidated, by this untoward accident,
from continuing this fpecies of fraud ; for on a
a future occafion he fabricated paper, with the
fieceffary marks, at a village fituate on the river
of Genoa. By means of that very paper he
forged a note for two thoufand five hundred
crowns, which he afterwards got difeounted at
Savona. But let us return to Bergamo.

upon themfelveSj on account of having con*
traded a clandcftine marriage. But as begging
was a bad trade, and afforded a. very fcanty
fupport, the fiuiband (olicited his wife to aug­
ment it by thefale o f her charms $ and, in the
midft of menaces for this purpofe, he ufually
uttered the mod horrible impieties. •“ O f what

which they received, this virtuous couple co n ­
tinued their journey, and arrived at Barcelona,
where they remained for fix'months. A t the end
u f‘ that iperiod, their property being entirely
expended, Balfamo perfuaded his wife to g o

bourhood of ¡their inn, which belonged to a
convent; and defired her to inform the fatber-
confeffor, that they were-both defeendcd from-

married without the confent of their relations,
and their remittances falling. fhort, they were
reduced to the molt deplorable poverty.

and even improved upon his inilruftions; fo
that the confeffor a&ually believed the fabri­
cated ftory, and prefented' her with a fmall fum
of money«. On the next morning he lent them
ahamj and following himfelf foon after, to make
them a vifxt of condolence, he fainted the huf­
band by the title o f“ H is Excellency.” Both of
them have acknowledged the truth of this anec­
dote ) but Balfamo, not covetous o f the glory
of it, has attributed the honour of the invention
entirely to his wife. However, the vigilance of
the reftor o f the pariih embarrafled them not a
little ; for, having conceived fufpicions of their *
veracity, he demanded the contratt o f their
marriage, which they happened not to have
along with them.
That they might not hereafter be expofed to
a fimilar mortification, Balfamo determined to
folicit the prote&ion of a grandee ; and to ob­
tain this he thought that he could not devile a
better expedient for his introduftion, than to
make ufe of the attra&ions of his wife.
Young and-agreeable, of a middle fize, pof-
feffed of a white ikin, brown hair, round counte* ,
nance, brilliant eyes, happy phyfiognomy, and
uncommon fenfibility, Lorenza was admirably
calculated to excite the pafiions. This actually

took place on the prefent occafion, as well as
on many others. '
The huiband and wife having prefented them-
felves to-this perfonage, informed him of their
iituation. After having ordered the huiband
to retire, the magiftrate interrogated the wife
with great ferioufnefs as to the truth Of their
marriage. H e became feniible by her anfwer9
that this ceremony had taken place ; and while
he undertook to procure an authentic copy of
the certificate from •Rome, the beauty of the
lady made fuch an imprelfion upon his mind,
that he infinuated certain propofals that did but
little credit to his character. She refufed com­
pliance with his defircsj and he gave her time
to refleét on the fubjeft, and difmified her. The
eircumftances o f this interview having been re­
counted to the huiband, Lorenza received the
moft bitter reproaches on account of her be­
haviour; and at the end of a few days was
carried back to the hòufe of the grandee.
Scarce was fhe arrived when he requefted her to
anfwer his propofttion with a fim plej« or no :
the huiband, here intercepting her reply, ex­
claimed, Yes ! and inftantly retired. The con­
, fequence of this reply produced a double piftole-,

the eight following days, during which her
hufband efcorted her regularly to the fame
hotel. ' .
T he contra# o f marriage at length arrived
from R om e; but by this time Balfamo had
formed an intimacy with a nobleman who was
upon his travels. H e alfo fell in love with L o ­
renza; who did not fail, as may be readily fup-
pofed, of informing her huiband of the cir-
cumftanee. Balfamo knowing that in a ihort
time the tribute of double p'tftoles would ceafe to ^
bet paid'by the enamoured magiftrate, coun-
felled his wife to Batter the paffion, but not to
fatisfy the wilhes, of the ftrangerj that he might
be enabled.to travel to.Madrid at his expence,
as he wifhed much to vifit that capital.
This defign was carried into execution with
all imaginable fuccefs. They, all three repaired
to- the metropolis o f Spain, where they lived in
the fame houfej the noble traveller occupying
an apartment contiguous to the lady’s. " N
However, as he paid all the charges, ar. d be­
gan to perceive that he was duped, he at length
threatened to remove. Alarmed at this circum-
ftance, Balfamo informed his fpoufe that it was

nued for a confiderable time. Almoft eVery
morning at day-break this kind fpoufe awak­
ened his wife, and informed her that it was time
for her to rife, and repair to the apartment of
their illuftrious gueft. '
A law-fuit which Balfatno carried on at this
time againft one of his countrymen, gave him an
opportunity o f fending his ■ wife to folicit the
miniiter in his behalf. In the courfc^of this
affair, he infilled on a fcrupulous and exa£t ac­
count o f every thing that concerned his fair
petitioner: (he informed him minutely of her
fituation, even to her connexion with the
ftranger, whom he wifhed her to difmifs, at the
fame time propofing himfelf as a lover in his
Head. This arrangement however not being
fatisfaftory to Madam Balfamo, the .miniiter
immediately withdrew his protection; obferving,
at the fame time, that he fhould hereafter be
inexorable to her entreaties.
T h is threat was verified in a Ihorttime ; for
the traveller being no longer able to fatisfy the
avaricious demands of Balfamo, who was per­
petually foliciting either money or effeCts, at
length fefolved to abandon them. On this Lo*?
renza, by the order of her hufband, who had
been informed of every thing, repaired once
more to the miniiter: but he, with the ftately

tions; and difmifled her with this-energetic re­
ply :— “ I have learned, Madam, to hold a pro-
mife facred !”
Being thus abandoned, they refolved to re­
pair to Lilbon. A s foon as they arrived there,
Balfamo made it his bufinefs to enquire at a
celebrated ordinary* where he dined, concern­
ing fome perfons in affluent circumftancesj and
he foon learned the name and refidence of a
rich merchant, who feemed exadly fuited to
his purpofe. H e accordingly diipatched his
wife next 'morning to folicit alms o f "him. On
this occafion lhe received a piece of money,
which was accompanied with certain offers of
another fort; and in conclufion an interview
was agreed upon in a garden belonging to his
, country houfe. >
In the courfe o f three months this amour
was cultivated with uncommon aifiduity by •
both parties, and produced no lefs than eight
piftoles for every vifit made by the lady. H ow ­
ever, the fear of a difpute with the family of
the merchant, who beheld this intercourfe with
an evil eye, made Balfamp at length determine
to leave this city, and repair to London.

after his arrival, he hired apartments in Whitcomb-ftreet,
immediately adjoining to Hedge-lane, in which he pretends
to have dedicated a large portion of his time tohis favourite
ihidies of ch'em
iftry and phyfic.
During his difpute with M. de Morande, the following
inventory of his jewels was publiflied in the Courier do

“ A gold repeater, enamelled in blue, with ftars
of gold, and enriched with two circlets of diamonds. Its
chain, three rows of fmalidiamonds, terminated by threelarge
ones, and brilliant pendants ; from two of which hung a
duller of diamonds, and from the fourth a feal mounted in

called the Marquis de Vivona. One o f the
quakers was captivated with the charms o f the
lady; and, in his attempts tofeduce her virtue,
entirely forgot the aufterity of his feft. Without
yielding to his wiihes, Lorenza informed her
huiband o f his paffion ; and he contrived, in
concert with Vivona, that ihe ihould promife
him a private interview} that two witneflcs
Ihould watch in an adjoining chamber; and
that, at the'moment when the quaker ihould
think himfelf on the brink of happinefs, upon
a certain fignal being given, Balfanio, Vivona,
and the fervants ihould ruih into the apart­
ment j and by means of threats, infults, and
menaces, oblige him to pay dearly for his uo-
tailed pleafures.
Every thing Succeeded according to their
wiihes. T he quaker, faithful to his appoint­
ment, repaired at the hour agreed upon, and
began to compliment the lady in the manner
made ufe of in Penfylvania. Lorenza afie£t?d
to be furprifed at his gallantry ; and aiked how
it was pofiible for one o f the “ friends” to be

decable acquifitions which he had made, both
in money and effe&s. The reader’s aftoniih-
ment will however ceafe, if, to the wafte na­
turally attendant on ill-gbtten wealth, be added
the proud and extravagantdemeanorof Balfamo,
who, that he might appear a man o f confe-
quence in the opinion of the world, fet no
bounds to his expences.
It is an acknowledged fa&, without reckon­
ing the prefents which he and his wife had
received, in the courfe of their travels, injewels,
watches, &c. that he procured upwards of a
hundred thoufand crowns in hard caih. Thia

This invitation Was accepted j and it is from
.Caglioftro’s own mouth that we learn, that
during the whole of the journey Duplaifir tra­
velled in a poft-chaife along with his wife, while
he himfelf accompanied them at a humble difc
tance on horfeback. ’
It is'not difficult'to comprehend the confe-«
quence of this arrangement. ‘T he wife of Bal-
famo became the miftrefs of Duplaifir, and
continued in that capacity for many months at
Paris, during which he defrayeef the expencey
of the whole party. T he infatiable difpofition
o f Balfamo, who always wiihed to fell his m

the lover, whole finances were not very confi-
derable : he accordingly advifed Lorenza, if fhc
chofe to continue this trade, either to carry it on
on ber own account, or to return to Italy and five
with her parents. She afiured him thatihe de-
figned to follow his counfel; and in a few days
after a&ually abandoned the habitation of her
hulband, and removed to another which her1
,
paramour had provided for her ; taking care,
however, to carry all her clothes and ornaments
along with her. •
The hufband, extremely irritated at this elope­

ment, had recourfe to the king’s authority, and
obtained an order to arreft his wife, who was
conduced to St. Pelagic *, where ihe remained
for feveral months; during all this time he
himfelf took up his abode with an old demi­
rep.
T he fale of a certain wafh for beautifying the
ikin procured him fome money about this pe­
riod ; but he received much more from the
generality of the lady with whom he was con-
ne£ted, and with whom he continued to live a
confiderable time after his wife was releafed
from S t. Pelagic. A t length he took a houfe
for himfelf near to one of the barriers.
It is not a little interefting to thofe delirous

this remarkable man, that during the time that
Lorenza was in confinement, the police drew
•up a memorial, which was afterwards printed
in Paris, under the title of “ M a correfpon-
dance avec le Comte Caglioftro.” Am ong other
things contained, in this, is to be found the dc-
pofition of Duplaifir, who fwore that, although

Balfamo and his Wife had lived during three
months at his expence, they had neverthelefs
contracted debts to the amount of more than
two hundred crowns with milliners, peruke-
makers, and dancing-mailers.
H aving taken a houfe at one of the barriers,
as we have already mentioned, during his refi-
dence there he found means to form an ac­
quaintance with two perfons of diftinCtion, who
carried their love of chemiflry to a ridiculous
excefs. H e pretended to have difeovered
fome miraculous fecrets in that fcience; he
even aiTerted that he had found out the art of
making gold, and of prolonging human ex-
iilence. This latter aiTertion had peculiar
charms for one o f them, who had arrived at a
very advanced age. T o confirm their belief
in his promifes, he took a few Spaniih piftoles
from them, and having melted them along with
other materials in a crucible, he produced a
lump of gold of more value than the. money
which they had depofited before the operation.
By means of thefe ftratagems, and feveral others,
he procured upwards of fifty louts d’ors.
It is almoil needlefs to mention, that our
hero neither communicated to them thefecretof
making gold, nor of efcaping from death. H e
engaged, however, to difeover both of thefe de-

J t d e r a t a ; but the period for the performance
haying at length elapfed, his pupils began to
form fufpicions concerning his veracity. Bal-
famo was well aware of the danger of his fitua-
' tion; and dreading' left he ihould be arrefted
for the money advanced, he procured a pair-
port under a fictitious name, fled with great
precipitation to Brufiels, and after having tra­
v e le d Germany and Italy, arrived at his native
city of Palermo.
H e did not however long enjoy his liberty
among his countrymen. Marano, the jeweller
whom he had not only duped but baftinadoed,
as we have before mentioned, having not yet
forgot his injuries, immediately applied to the
magiftrates, and procured an order for his im-
prifonment. Soon after this, a profecution
took place in confequence of the teftament that
had been forged in favour of the Marquis
M au rigi: the protection of a nobleman, to
whom he had procured a powerful recommen­
dation while at Naples, prevented him, how­
ever, from being condemned to the galleys j *
and he was actually fet at liberty, on condition
o f immediately departing from Palermo.
Being thus once more obliged to abandon
the city which gave him birth, he repaired, in
company with his wife, to M alta; where he

is faid to have fupported himfelf for fome
time by the fale of his pomade for-improv­
ing the complexion: but the commodity
from which he drew his mod certain revenue
appears to have been—^his wife !
A t the end of three months he left that
ifland alfo. L et us here make a lhort digref-
fion:— -How comes it about that this man could
never remain for any confiderable time in any
one country whatever ? And how was it pol^-
fible that he could tranfport himfelf with fuch
facility from one end of Europe to another?
' W e can only anfwer as to the’ fa£L— H is travels,
his voyages, his vagabond kind of life, are known
to all the world. T o an unquiet and turbulent
fpirit, he added a paffion for wandering: and
this pailion was not unaccompanied with its
peculiar advantages ; K
for he was thus fuddenly
removed from his cenfors, his creditors, and
his enemies. .
From Malta he paffed over to Naples, where
he remained for feveral months; and he there
once more found his advantage in pretending
to an extraordinary knowledge in the fcience
o f chemiftry, and the myfteries of the cabala.
Am ong others, he got acquainted in that city
with a merchant and a prieft, who became both
enamoured of his pretended difcoveries. The

merchant was rich; the monk governed him;
and our adventurer perceiving it to be for his
intereft ferrule his new friend without the in­
convenience attendant upon a rival, attempted'
to fupplant the holy father, and fucceeded ac­
cordingly. ’ •
Having thus acquired.the undivided efteem
of this fimple man, he found no great difficul­
ty in borrowing large fums from him, promif­
ing in return to make him acquainted with thole
fciences which he dignified with the epithet of
Jublime. At this period, in compliance with the
defires of Lorenza, he invited his father-in-law,
and his wife’s brother, to Naples ; the latter of
whom he was prevailed upon to take under his
protection. This young man was handfome,
and had an engaging air: Balfamo therefore
formed the defign of matching him with a lady
poffeffing fimilar qualities, that he might rear
her up in the fame manner as he had done
Lorenza, and acquire the fame advantages by
means of her beauty. He was well allured that,
with two females fo excellently educated, he could
not fail of procuring immenfe fums.
Accompanied by his wife, and his brother-
in-law, he left Naples, and fet off for France.
Having arrived at Marfeilles, they determined
to remain in that city for fome time. Balfamo

found an opportunity,duringhis refidencethere,
ofgaining theconfidenceofalady who,although
Ihe was old, had not as yet entirely abandoned
the idea of gallantry. Having perceived her *
foible, he determined not to let fuch an opT
portunity efcape his vigilance; and whether
it was that the beldame became enamoured of
him, or that he feigned to be attached tQ her,
it fo happened, that an intimacy and attach*
ment took place between them. He himfelf
has avowed, without any referve whatever, that
he received abundance of prefents from her?
fome in money, and others in effedts.
This lady, who had been formerly very hancj-
fome, had a lover during her youth, who ftill
refided in her neighbourhood; and, notwith-
Handing his advanced age, exhibited fymptoms
of the ftrongeft jealoufy af her partiality for
Baliamo. The old lady was determined how­
ever to lofe neither of her adorers ; the one, be-
caufe he wasin the vigour of youth; the other,
becaufe he was exceftively wealthy. She ac­
cordingly fuggefted to the firft the means of
foftening the afperity of the fecond. The an-
cienc lover ftill felt all the ardour of affedtion
.for his charmer ; but he perceived with horror
that age had furrowed his cheek, and en­
feebled his pleafures. Balfamo took advapr

tage of this, and promifcd by means of a che­
mical operation to reftore him to the full vi­
gour of youth and enjoyment j and as this de*
crepit gallant was feized with the mania of dif-
coyering the philofopher’s ftone, the pretended
philofopher had the moft ample opportunity of
deceiving himat his own eafe. He accordingly
made him acquainted with feveral operations
which he performed by means of his alembic,
and amufed him with the promife of dilcover-
ing the fecrct of making gold. In the mean
time, he extracted confiderable fums from him
under pretence of purchafing the ingredients,
which he pretended to be exceedingly expen-
five. .
While every thing went on in this profper-
ous manner, Balfamo did not lofe fight of the
proje& which he had formed in behalf of his
brother-in-law. He had introduced him as a
Roman cavalier, pofielfing a large fortune; and
the better to fupport this importance, he had
clothed him in the moft fumptuous and extra­
vagant apparel. In the mean time, he himfelf
pafted for an officer of rank; and always af-
fefted to appear drefled in the PruQtan uni-
'fbrm, which Agliata had qualified him to wear.
All this deception was intended to bring

.about a match between the Roman cavalier
and one of the daughters of his female friend,
who was about eighteen-years of age. He him-
felf accordingly demanded the young Jady in
form from her mother, who was quite enchant-,
ed with the honour, of an alliance with him.
The marriage however did not take place, ow­
ing to the obftinate refiftance of Lorenza and
her brother. It would.be here unncceflary ta
mention the brutality and cruel ..treatment
wl\ich both of them affirm to have experienced
' from Balfamo on account of this rcfufal; the
truth of their declaration is fufficiently gua­
rantied by the tranfports of rage natural to a
man of his charadter, onfeeinghimfelf deprived
of fuch a fine opportunity of acquiring wealth.
The time for accomplilhing the wiihesof the
old beau 'N ii now nearly elapfed, .and it became
necefiary to come to fome refolution howto a£t
upon the occafion. This was not difficult:
Balfamo perfuaded him that he had juft re­
ceived intelligence that his father-in-law was
fuddenly feized with a dangerous malady at
Rome, and that it was abfolutely necefiary that
he ihould immediately, repair to that capital.
This excufe alfo ferved forthe enamoured lady

gence on his journey, and return with more
celerity, they presented him with, an excellent
.travelling carriage, and a large fum of money.
Having converted the carriage into dollars
at Barcelona, Balfamo, with his wife and her
brother, paired through Valencia, and arrived
at Alicant. M. Sachi, a furgeon, publiihed a
letter at Strafbourg,.in 178a, inwhich he aflerts
that heentertained and attended on Caglioftro,
his wife, and brother-in-law, during their refi-
dence in Valencia, where he firft aiTumed the
name of Don Thifcio, wore the uniform of a
lieutenant, andpretended to be a native of Na­
ples. He adds that, being driven from that city,
they departed for Alicant, where Don Thifcio
experienced the mod humiliating reception.
' . In confequence of this, Balfamo proceeded
to Cadiz, where he found anotherfanatic in the
myfteHes of chemiftry. Having introduced
himfelf with his ufual effrontery to this new
dupe> he tricked him out of a bill of exchange
for onfe thoufand crowns, under the ordinary
pretext of procuring the ingredients neceflary
for the compofition of the philofopher’s ftone,
Befides this, he received a prefent of a curious
gold repeater; and was adroit enough to make

cious merchant took out of his caiket on pur-
pofe to ihew him.
In the courfe of his interrogatories, he could
not deny part of thefe fa&s } but he affirmed
that he had received the watch, fome money,
and the moft hofpitableentertainmentduringall
the time he remained at Cadiz, as a reward
proceeding from the voluntary generofity of the
donor, on account of the valuable chemical fe-
erets which he had communicated to him.
Before his departure from that city he quar­
relled with his brother-in-law, under pretence
that he had ftolen fome of his property} and
dreading left his hoft ihould perceive his im-
pofture, he and his wife foon after departed for
London. It was during his fecond refidence
in the capital of England, that he got ac­
quainted with a Mr. Sc-----1 and a Mrs.
F-----y, both of them addifted to gambling in
the lottery. He informed themthat he pofiefled
the fcience of divination ; that he could predift
with certainty the numbers that would bedeli-

By thefe means he was enabled to procure
large fums of money from thefe credulous peo­
ple; but as neither of them was enabled to
realize the promifes of Balfamo, they at length
perceived the impofture which had been prac-
tifed againft them, and made application to a
court ofjuftice for redrefs. In confequence of
this la^-fiijt he was frequently imprifoned*,

chances, and afeertain the numbers that would turn up in

that he was lucky enough to announce the numbers 55 and
57, during his refidence in Whitcomb-ftreet, in 1776, to the
perfons indicated above, by which they procured a very
large fum of money. It has alfo been faid, that certain,
people, not content with the ufufruB of his abilities, applied
to a perfon in the commiffion of the peace for Weftminfter,
who a&ually granted a warrant againit Caglioftro, on the
charge of witchcraft, and thus got pofleffionof the curious
MS. which however they were incapable of ullng. T .
* It is well known that Caglioftro was confined for foqae
' time in tjie King’s Bench. After regaining his liberty he
found himfelf arrefted fo often, that he at length a£hially
hired apartments in the houfe of Saunders, a {herifPs officer,

and expenfive procefs. ,
It was'in that metropolis, and about this
• very time, that he began to conceive that pro-
je£t which he afterwardscarried into execution,
and which foon after made fuch a noife all over-
Europe. Having for fome time affociated with ,
the free maions, and been, admitted into all
their lodges, he formed the defign of inftitut-
ing a newfe£t, of which we ihall hereafter give
a more ample detail: at prefent we ihall cpn-
fine ourfelves to thofe circumftances which are
neceflary to the knowledge of his hiftory.
Balfamo foon perceived that he could not
difcover a better fource of i'mpofture than that
of a new fyftem of mafonry j andthat it might
have a more fure and more extenfive effeft, he
was determined to give it all the charms of
novelty. He accordingly prefcribed rules,’
Among other law-fuits, he had a very remarkable one •
with a Mr. Scott and a Mifs Fry, that was referred to the
arbitration of the late Mr, How arth; in confequence of
which that gentleman ordered a diamond necklace, bought
at a pawnbroker’s in Princes-ftreet, and faid to have been
prefented to Madame Caglioftro on purpoie to propitiate the

formed regulations, and.invented the neceffary
ceremonies. It is difficult to determine to what
a length the blindnefs and folly of mankind
•may be carried ; it is fufficient here merely to
mention, that he confeiTed, during his interro-
igatories, that he procured a prodigious number
of difciples, all of whom acknowledged, him
as their chief and their mailer. This is the
origin of that celebrity which has made his
name fo well known in every quarter of the
globe, and which has occafioned fo much con*
je&ure for a number of years.
A lucky combination of circumflan'ces tended
not a.little to the accomplifhment of his grand
obje£t; his converfation, his manner of living,
and his appearance, all cbntributed to the pro­
pagation of his tenets.
About this time he adopted the name of Cag-
lioflro, and aiTumed.the title of Countj he was
alfo extremely fcrupulous to conceal his'origin,
his fituation, and.his age. To fome he affirmed
that he was bom before the deluge, and to
others that he had affifled at the marriage at
Cana in Galilee. Sometimes he gave out that
he was born at Malta; and fometimcs that he
was the fon of the grand mailer, by a princefs
of Trebifonde. He fpoke of his travels, his
iludies, his learning, in a manner at once em­

ufually replete with his travels in Arabia,

He would alfo frequently mention his difcove-

fecrets of nature of which he had obtained a
knowledge.

an apple in its mouth.

His great art confifted in uttering certain vague and incom-

( might interpret in their own manner whatever they could
not underhand. Reafon is clear and perfpicueus, but it has

contributed not a little tothe importance which
he affixed to his nameandhis perfon. The world
fwarms with fanatics who believe every thing in

becoming fuddenly rich by acquiring the fecret
of makinggold, and ofprolonging life bymeans
of the philofopher’s ftone-f“, flattered the avarice
and the felf-love of a prodigious number of
perfons. In regard to medicine, fortune was
exceedingly favourable to him, and he actually
fucceeded in the cure of fome difcafes. But in
truth his knowledge did not furpafs that which
is acquired by every quack and nojlrum-monger.
In fine, no perfon became rich by his means,
and yet he himfelf acquired immenfe fums
by his numerous impofitions. A liquor to
which he gave the appellation of Egyptian
wine, and a compofition which was called the
Reftorative Pow ders o f Count Caglioftro,were iome

The train of fervants with which hewas now
furrounded *, correfponded with his affefted
confequence. When he travelled, he was al­

domeftics of all kinds, W
ho being well mounted
and clothed, .gave an air of credibility to the
high birth of which he fo much boafted. The

that appeared every where around them.
His ofientatious generofiey made a great

delay of his remittances, a theft that had been

other accident of the like nature. She always
took care to conclude by obferving, that the
pride and delicacy of the Count, joined to
the defire which he entertained of doing all
poffible good to the human race, without the
profpedt of any return whatever, made him
conftantly refufe the afiiftance of his friends.
The pupils of Caglioftro becoming enrap­
tured at the difintereftednefs of their matter,
were fure to open their purfes upon thefe
occafions; conjuring the lady at the fame
time to convey their prefents in fuch a manner
as ihould preclude the Count from blufhing at
the tribute which they paid to hisextraordinary
talents. By means of thefe and other fimilar
deceptions, of which we ihall fpeak hereafter,
he was enabled to procure whatever money he

by fome other lueky incidents, that this advefl-
turer was enabled to procure a celebrity, of
which a parallel has not occurred in the hiftory
of impoftoFS. Who could imagine that a manof
this defcription ihould have been received with
refpeét in fomeof the moil enlightened cities in
Europe ? That he Ihould have been regarded
as a ftar propitious to the human race, as a new
prophet, and as a type and reprefentation of the
Divinity ? That he Ihould have approached
thrones? That haughty grandees Ihould have
become his humble fuitors, and nobles paid
him the moil profound veneration ?
Thefe fails however cannot be denied. Such
was the popular delufion, that in France, and
indeed in moil countries, his portrait and that
of his wife were to be feen every where, oi>
fans, on rings, on fnuff-boxes, and on medal­
lions. His bull was eût in marble, call in­
bronze, and placed in the palaces of the nobi­
lity. Even this was not fufficient for under

avarice of a Dutchman, who was anxious to
increafe his fortune by means of the other’s
(kill in prognoilication. Under this pretence
he cozened him out of a fum of from four to
five hundred crowns. The Dutchman, being in
poiTeffion of the pretended fecret, immediately
haftens to Brufiels, where the lottery was about
to begin drawing; and Caglioftro, profiting by
his abfence, takes an opportunity to leave the
Hague. He then patted into Italy; and arriv­
ing at Venice, attumed the title of the Marquis
de Pellegrini. The difcovery of fome chemi­
cal fecrets gained him the confidence of a
merchant of that city, from whom he found
means to procure a thoufand fequins; alluring %
him, with the rood bare-faced impudence, that
he would teach him the art of making gold,
of changing hemp into filk, and of fixing mer­
cury. After this fraud, which could not fail of
being fpeedily difcovered, he faw the neceifity .
of quitting Venice, and even Italy.
Having returned into Germany, after refid­
. ing for fome time in feveral different cities on
the Continent, he refolved to take up his abode
in Courland. At Mittau he attracted the at­
tention of feveral people of high rank, who
were led by his reputation, which now began

to be confpicuous, to regard him as an extraor­
dinary perfon* “ I did not fail,” faid he, it*
the courfe of his interrogatories, ** to fuftain
the charatter of the great perfonage whicli
they enabled me toaflume; and I was carefulon
this oceafion to conduit myfelf after the man­
ner ofa man brought up in a court.” He now
received viiks fromthe grandees, and paid them
in return. A nobleman having become en­
amoured of Madam Caglioftro, Ihe at firft ap­
peared,to be cruel; but although the hufband,
ever Once the time that he began to acquire
celebrity by his fublime difeoveries in ma-
fonry, had fet an extraordinary value on the
Countefs, and endeavoured to make h'er ap­
pear a refpedtable woman, yet he could not
refrain from being tempted upon the prefent
oceafion by the riches of -the lover. He ac­
cordingly perfuaded his wife to be favourable
to his pafiion.
In the meantime Caglioftro, by means of his
mafonry, began- to gain an afcendency over the
minds of a great number of the nobility, and
fucceeded in infpiring the inhabitantsof Cour*
land with an averfion to their fovereign. Their
attachment to his perfon was carried to fuch an

that he had virtue enough to refill the tempta­
tion, and that he refufed the proffered boon
from the refpect. due to fovereigns. His
wife has affured us, that his refufal was pro­
duced by the reflection that his impoftures
would be foon difcovered. However that may
have been, this much is certain—that he did
not let this opportunity efcape of colle&ing a
prodigious number of prefents, in gold, filver,

which he pradifed chemiftry and medicine, he
departed forWarfaw j and, on his arrival there,
made ufc of all his artifice to deceive a prince
to whom he found means to be introduced.
Seduced by the tricks difplayed by Caglioftro
relative to his mafonry, which appearedto have
an intimate connedion with magic, he ap­
peared exceedingly defirous to acquire a know­
ledge of this fcience; and was anxious above all
things to obtain a devil from this pretended
mag:cian, whom he might have always at his
command.
Caglioftro puffed him up a long time with
the expedation of fulfilling this ridiculous pro-
mife, and adually procured prefents from him
to the amount of fcveral thoufand crowns.
The prince at'length perceiving that there was
no hope of retaining one of the infernalJpirits
in his fervice, wifhed to make himfelf mafter of
the earthly affeHions of the Countefs; but in
this too he was difappoimed, as the lady pofi-
tively refufed to comply with his defires. Find-
litary rank. He was then under the neceflity of palling for a
ftranger whohad acquired uncommon ikill in the fciences o f

abandoned every other fentiment except that
of revengej and intimidated our adventurer and.
his wife in fuch a manner by his menaces, that
they were obliged to reftore his prefents, and
abandon Warfaw.
They then took the road to Franckfort, and
after a ihort ftay there proceeded to Straf­
burg. The fabulous ‘
palladium was never re­
ceived with more reverence than they experi­
enced in that city. The reputation ofour l^ero
had preceded him; and he was loaded with
cardies, overwhelmed with applaul'e, and.re­
ceived with every demonftration ofjoy. During
his reGdence there he contratted a friendihip
with a perfon of diftinftion, and was vifited by
him with the utmoft ceremony. In aihort time
he acquired fuch a defpotic empire over the
mind of this illuftrious perfonage, that he be­
came his tyrant *: thus all his defigns were
eafily accompliihed.

Caglioftro»ufed to fay to his wife, “ I wilh to
getpoffefllon of his head ; you mud take care'
of the remainder of his body.” The vi&im
readily fell into the double fnare which was
thus laid for him ; and it may be fairly faid that
he wasplaced between two fires, in fuch a man­
ner that efcape was become impoifible. He
accordingly laviihed immenfe fums upon this
virtuous f a ir ; fome rich prefents ftill remain, as
teilimonies of the generofity and magnificence
of the donor.
To complete his folly, on the reprefcntation
of Caglioftro he agreed to ereft a fmall edifice,
in which he was to experience a phyfical rege­
neration, and to becomeyoung again, by his
wonderful operations. This was the funda­
mental impofture of his Egyptian mafonryj*
and the fum of twenty thoufand francs was ac­
tually paid him, on purpofe to accompliih the
undertaking.
Among other dupes, there was a certain lady

from his archbifhopric, and of having aflembled an army of
marauders cn the frontiers of France, with whom he has
more than once threatened tto undertake a predatory expe­

At length, however, heleft Straiburg, laden
with an immenfe booty. In a memorial which
he afterwards prefented to the parliament of
Paris, he pretends to have fet off with great
precipitation for Naples, on receiving intelli­
gence that one of his friends was on his death­
bed, and thathe actuallyreceived his laft breath.
In his anfwer to the interrogatories before the
Inquifition, he however aflerted that he was
obliged to leave Straiburg oh account of the
perfecutions which he experienced from the
phyiicians of that city.
This much is certain—-that from Straiburg
he paCed into Italy, and vifited Naples. His.
ftay in that city was not long, as he remained
there no more than three months.
He wiihed to infinuate, during his examina­
tion, that he would not have departed fo fpeed-

thejealoufywhich he had raifed inthe breadsof
the medical men of that city, on account of the
extraordinary cures which he had performed;
and that he had repaired from thehce to Bour-
deaux, with a defign ofreturning into England.
His wife however has contradifted both of
thefe aflertionsj and declared that the real mo­
tive of his departure was, becaufe he found that
country unfavourable to his fyftem of mafonry.
Having thus taken the road towards France,
he at length arrived at Bourdeaux, where heex-
ercifed his two profeilionsof medicine and ma­
fonry ; without, however, renouncing his old
habits of roguery and deception. It was about
this period that heplayed off one of thofe tricks
for which he was fo famous * the particulars of
which are yet recounted with the utmoft relpeifc
by his deluded followers.
Having fallen into a dangerous bilious com­
plaint, on account of the chagrin which he
had experienced at being forbid to enter the
houfe of a married lady whom he loved to
diftra&ion, he beheld his bed conftantly fur-
rounded by his pupils in Egyptian mafonry.
One day, pretending to awake from a profound
lethargy, he informed them that he had had a
celeftial vifion. We ihall here mention thecir-
cumftances which he then communicated, and
which

which he afterwards confefled in the courfe of
his procefs.
He informed them that he thought he was
feized by the neck by two perfons, who drag­
ged himby force into a fubterraneous building.
A door then opened of its own accord; and he
was inflantly conveyed into a moft charming
apartment, which he compared to aroyal faloon
magnificently illuminated, in which a grand
feftival was celebrating. All the afiiftants were
clothed in white robes, which defeended to
their feetj and herecolle&ed among themmany
of his difciples in mafonry who were no more.
He immediately thought that, being deli­
vered from the evils of this world, he was at
•length arrived in Paradife. A long robe is
prefented to him, and a fword like to that
which is ufually placed in the hand of the ex­
terminating angel. He advances; and, dazzled
by the radiance around him, he proftrates him-
felf, and offers up his thanks to the Supreme
Being for having conferred fuch happinefs upon
him. But at this inftant he hears an unknown
voice exclaim— “ Behold what thy recompence
ihall be; but, to acquire this, it is neceffarythat
thou ihouldft ftilllabour.”— And thus his vifion
ended; which, ifweareto believehimfelf, ferved
to ftrengthen him in his refolution of propagat­

ing his tenets with redoubled ardour: however,
if we are to give credit tohis wife, this was no­
thing more than a fabulous narration, which he
invented merelyforthe purpofe of confirminghis
pupils in their obedience* and of making them
Hill more attached to the myfteries of his fyf»
tem.
Whatever'might have been the motives, the
effedts were peculiarly advantageous ; as a wi­
dow lady of birth was fo far feduced by this,
and fome other impolitions, that he found
means of tricking her out of five thoufand
crowns.
From Bourdeaux hetravelled to Lyons. The
foundationof a motherlodge inthat latter city, •
pccupied his labours during three months. His
zeal for the propagation of his opinions, how­
ever, did not prevent him fromraifing a contri­
bution of four or five hundred louts ¡Tors, under -
pretence of communicating fome chemical pre­
parations to his difciples. Thefe fecrets, as
ufual, confided in the transformation of metals,
the compoficion of gold, &c. &c. Some experi­
ments on mercury were however the foie proofs
which he gave them of his proficiency in the
fcience of metallurgy; and his difciples found
themfelves unable to perform thofe grand che­
.mical operations which he pretended to teach *
them.

them. To prevent their reproaches, he fore­
times made life of one pretence, and fome-
times of another j but he generally had the
effrontery to affirm that their failure was
produced by their fins, their murmurs, and
their incredulity. Intoxicated as it were with
the magic ’ of H
is Egyptian mafonry, they
received the reproaches of their grand matter
with the fame rcfpeifc as the relponfes of an
oracle, and became more and more entangled
in the labyrinth of abfiirdity.

acquired uncommon eclat, and indeed attempt*
ed to furpafs each other. We cannot affirm
that they a£ted in concert on this memorable
occafion; we can however with fafety aflert,
that Caglioftro was well acquainted with the de-

intrigue, and that he always kept his eye ftea-
dily fixed upon the famous necklace. He cer­
tainly perceived, and has indeed confefled in

all the manoeuvres which ihe put in practice to
accompliih her criminal defigns. Let us not,
therefore, rob Caglioftro of the glory of having
employed the utmoft efforts of his genius in
profiting by her abilities.
The whole affair was at length difeovered.
He had forefeen this; and wiihed to have evad­
ed the inevitable confequences attendant on
detection : but it was nowtoo late. The officers
of the police were perfuaded, that without his
aid this piece of roguery and deception could
never have been carried on ; and he was ar-
refted, and imprifoned in the Baftile. He, how­
ever, did not lofe courage : he even found
means to corrupt his guards, and to,eftablifh a
correfpondence with the other prifoners who
wereconfined along with him. It was owing to
this that they were enabled to be uniform in
the anfwers which they gave in to the various
interrogatories to which they were obliged to
reply.
Caglioftro, who has recounted the whole of
the circumftances to us, has added, of his own
accord, that he denied every thing to hisjudges
withthe utmoft intrepidity ; and exhibited fuch
, 9Jamenefs in his replies, that, on Madame de la

By this means he was declared innocent...
Our readers,perhaps will not,be difpleafed at
the narrative of his life, which he delivered to
the judges while imprifoned in the Baftile;
we (hall here recapitulate the particulars. He
pretended that Altotas had afted as a Mentor
to him, and thatin the firft partof his lifethere
were fome particulars which had all the air and
appearanceof a romance. He confefifed that he
was unacquainted either with his parents-of his
country; but he imagined himfelf to .be of an
illuilrious family, and fuppoted thathe was bom
at Naples. He aflerted that at an age when
he firft became confcious of his exiftence, he
found himfclf in the city of Medina, was called
Acharar, and lived in the houfe of the- Mufti
Salaahym. He was attended by two eunuchs,
and treated with the utmoft deference and re-
fpett. Altotas was his governor j in fine, he
had the whole fuperintendance of his condudt.
This fage educated him in the principles of the
Chriftian religion ; and informed him that his
parents, who were noble, profefied the fame
faith. He taught him botany and phyfic; he
inftrufled him in a great number of the orien­

conceived a reciprocal attachment to Tiirrt :
they exchanged rings together, and even
plighted their troth, as is cuftomary during the
nuptial ceremony. Befides this, he often at­
tempted to feduce a young woman who waited
upon his wife ; but from her virtue he always
experienced the mortification of a refufal.
As thefe intrigues did not fill his purfe, Cag-
lioitro foon found himfelf in the moil deplor­
able diftrefs for want of money ; and was ac­
cordingly obliged to pawn' his jewels, to raife
the fums necelTary for his expenCes.
He perceived that, in thià city, many were
eager to ftudy his character j that few were dif.
pofed to believe his impoftures ; and that no
perfon was defirous of fupplying his wants.
The recolleétion of his fins, and more efpe-
ciâlly thofe which he had committed againft our
holy religion, like agnawing worm , preyed.upon
his confcience without ceafing. All thefe cir-
cumftances ftrongly operated on his mind, and
at length made him determine to change his
afylum. ' .
He thought that the fituatiôn of affairs in
prance was fuch as to give him, hopes of a re­
treat in that country. He accordingly fent a

In the mean time he received intimation of
the profecution intended to be commenced

fon who afted the dilhonourable part of being

Notwithftanding thefe warnings, Caglioftro
never dreamed of dying; nay, he did not even
deftroy thofe numerous papers which have
fince ferved as vouchers of his crimes, and
have fumifiied the molt ample proofs of his
complicated guilt.

of the 27th of December 1789; and, after aq

fonry in general, and of Egyptian mafonry in
particular. ,

ber of individuals, who meet together at ftated
periods; and in certain determinate places» '
which they term Lodges. The book of theirita-

4or the firit time at London in 1723 : by this.it
appears that in that city and its environs there
were then twenty focieties, each of which had
its matter, and fent a deputy every year to a
¡general afiembly, held on purpofe to nominate
a grand matter., to whom they were all fubjeCt.
The directors of this inftitution have always
•been uncommonly anxious to hide the true.ori­
gin of their feCt, and to conceal their regula­
tions beneath a myfteriousjargon, fo as to pre­
vent their objeCt and their intentions from
being difcovcred. In the book already quoted,
it is aflerted that their meetings are intended
to reftore the glory of architecture, and the
mechanical art of mafonry. On this account
they date their hiftory from Adam, whomGod,
the grand architect of the univerfe,,,created after
his own image. Mofes and Solomon were, ac­
cording to them, grand matters of the order$
and the hiftory of their art is carried down in
this manner from age to age, and from nation
to nation, particularizing all thofe great princes
who have loved arid patronifed architecture.
In other works publiihed in defence of this
feCt, their origin is adduced from a remnant
of the Templars who took refuge in Scotland ;
and who, being often obliged to mingleamong
the infidels during the crufades, found it con­

venient to recognize each other by means of
certain Ggns. Some affirm that Thomas Crao-
mer, an apoftate bilbopi and favourite of Annp
Bullen, was the founder of this order ; other»
attribute its origin to Oliver Cromwell, whom
they call the famous deliverer of the people ^
and others, to King ¡Arthur*. ' ’
Adopting allegorical expreifions which have
a reference to the mechanic arts, they are di­
vided into apprentices, journeymen, and mas­
ters; and they are able to difeoyer each other
by touching the hand, and by pronouncing cer­
tain words fyllable by fyllable. Every clafs has *
its own particular Ggns and tokens, and every
lodge its own particular diftinguilhing charac­
tersfries. Their ceremonies abound with many,
ridiculous and even fuperftitious rites; but
what is chiefly to be blamed is, thp abufe which
they make of every thing facred. It is neceflary
to remark three things here s the firft is, thé
obligation which every member contrafts to
maintain aprofound and an inviolable fecrecy ;
* The holy father feems to be but little acquainted with
either the hiftory or myfteries of free maionry.
In this paragraph we find a new charge adduced againft
Cranmer, and a new virtue attributed to Oliver Cromwell ;
for we learn that the orte was a free mafon, and the other .
a patriot ! T .

and this he fubjeds himfelf to by means ofan
path, adrpiniftered in a folemp manner: thp ' ■
fecond is, the blind obedience which they pro-
pnife to all the orders, whatever they may be,
whiph thpy receive from their grand mailer:
the third is, the Arid and intimate union by
which they are conneded together; this is more
rigidly obferved than even the ties of confan-
guinity } and by it they are bound to fuc-
cour each other in all times, places, and dr-
cumftances.
The confequences arifing from thefe combi­
nations maybe eafily guefled. Many perlbns who
have carefully examinedandfcrutlnized the lives
of the free mafons, declare that they have found
jihem all, and particularly their leaders, to be
men of bad charader, ignorant, and equally
deftitute of morality and religion. But, laying
ponjcdure afide, we ihall have recourfe to fads
pnly. It refults from many fpontaneous decla­
rations, from the depoiitions of witnefies, and
other papers preferved in our archives, that

Perhaps this objeft is the defign of moft of
them; but this, which isthe grand fecret, is not
communicated to all the members, nor to all
the lodges. One need not be aftoniihed that,
although the democratic partyforms the majo­

rights of kings. Thefe Undoubtedly have not

quoted by Minutius Felix, “ that crimes dread
the day-light, and that virtue is never afraid of
the public eye.” He refleéted that in every
country, and in every government, the laws
both canonical and civil have equally prohi­
bited conventicles, and fecret affociations, on
account of their pernicious tendency with re-
fpedt to the public tranquillity, .and the fafety
of the ftàte. He weighed and approved the
reafons of thofe virtuous and prudent perfons
'who have always confidered the members of
thofe focieties as bafe and corrupt citizens. In
fine, he had before his eyes the example of
othçr monarchs, who had employed their ut-
moft endeavours in their refpeitive kingdoms

The immortal Benedift XIV. was animated
with the fame zeal. At the return of the jubilee
in the year 1750, he began to perceive hoW
many evils and' diforders had arifen from this
fe<51, and how much its members were increafed.
fie was fully convinced of thefc truths by the
free and fincere confeffion of many ftrangers
who had repaired to Rome to procure indul­
gences, and who had recourfe to the Pope to
relieve them from the excommunication which"
his predecelTor had launched in his bull.
Benedict XIV. confirmed this bull ; and re-
publiihed and extended it in his conftitution,
dated May 10, 1751, which commences with
thefe words— “ Providas Romanorum Pontifi-
cum.”
Many fecular princes have fince followed his
example. We fhall not here fpeak of the Teveré
prohibitions publiihed at Manheim, in 1737,

1785 ; and at other periods, in Savoy, Genoa,-

refy. If any perfcn ihould yet remain in un­
certainty, he has only to hear what Caglioftro
confeffod before the tribunal of the Inquifition*
and then to determine for himfclf. His tefti-
mony mull be acknowledged to have great
weight j for it cannot be denied butthat he had
an intimate knowledge of every thing that
concerned this myftery, having lived for a
number of years in the ftrideft union with the
free mafons, who regarded him as a being
poiflefled of a fuperuatural knowledge in that
fcience. .
According to him, it is divided into ieveral
feds; but there are two which are reckoned the
principal, and are moil efteemed. The firft,
which is the moft ftrid, is that to which the
adepts belong. The members of it profefs the
moil irreligious fentirrvents, and employ magic
in their operations; but their principal objed is
the deftrudion of the catholic religion, and of
monarchy.
The members of the other pretend to be
occupied about the difeovery of fecrets in the

Caglioftro avowed that he was ailbciated in
London with the fécond of thefe fefts *

received a diploma, which coft five guineas.
They prefented the lady with a ribbon of thé
order* on which the words U n i o n , S i l e n c e ,
and V i r t u e were embroidered ; and defired
her to fleep on the following night with this

orders to charge it. He accordingly obeys,
and introduces the powder and the ball * but

The awfulnefs of the ceremony had now fuch
an effect on-his mind* that, regardlefs of felft-
prefervation, he feizes theinft'rument of death,
draws thetrigger, andexperiences afmartftroke
on his fcull, which he at firft imagined to pro­
ceed from the ball, but which however did
not leave the lead mark behind. Having
fince aGifted at the initiation of many candi­
dates, he difcovered that on thefe occafions
the piftol was always changed; and that one
of the affiftants flood by to fuperintend the
operation, and give the mafon eledt a blow
upon the head, fo as to make him imagine
he had been wounded.
Having thus efcaped from the terrors of an
imaginary annihilation, an oath was admi-
niftered in great form, of which the following
is an exadt copy:

“ manner whatever.”
Being now initiated in the myfteries of ma-
fonry, he took care, during his reiidence in
London, to frequent all the different lodges.
A little time before his departure from that
capital, he happened to purchafe fome manu-
fcripts from a bookfeller, which appeared to
have belonged to a certain perfon of the name
of George Colton, of whom however he had no
knowledge whatever. On perufing thefe, he
found that- they treated of Egyptian mafonry,
but that magic and fuperftition were engrafted
on it. Being captivated with a variety of
.paffages in this work, he refolved to ereft a
new lodge on its balls; but at the fame time,
if we are to believe him, he determined to
avoid every thing that tended •to impiety.
He accordingly founded that very fyftem
which has tended fo much to his aftonifhing
celebrity, and which has been fince propagated
with fuch uncommon induftry in all parts of
the world. .

dnd no-fettled belief in matters of faith, thefe
Confederations Were not likely to deter him ;
inorc efpecially as his ambition was inflamed
with the idea of making his* hy the charms

not only the predominant, -but . die -moil: (

To enable the reader to comprehend how
he was able* for fo many years and in fo many
different countries* to propagate his tenets,
and procure difciples, it may be neceflary to
Cnter into Ibme details concerning Egyptian
mafonry. We fhall extrait our faits and ob-
fervatiorts from a book compofed by himfelf,
and now in oiir pofleflion, by which he avows
'he was always directed in the exercife of his
functions, and from which thofe regulations
and inftruftions were copied wherewith he
enriched many mother lodges. In’this treatife,
which is written in French* he promifes to con­
duit his difciples to perfection by meansofpby-
' fic a i and mural regeneration ; to confer,perpetual
youth and beauty on them j and rettore them
to -that fiate of innocence, which they were
‘ deprived ofby means oforiginalfin. He afferts

of mafonry, and allow its benefits to be par­
ticipated by both fexes. •
The ftatutes of the order then follow in ro­
tation; the divifion of the members into three

they might difcover each other; the officers

In a book faid to be printed at Paris in 1789,
it is afferted that thefe laft words were fug-
geftcd to Cagiioftro, as facred and cabaliftical
expreflitfns, by a pretended conjurer, who faid
that he was allifted by a fpirit, and that this
fpirit was no other than the foul of a cabalifti-
cal Jew, who by means of the magical a rt had
murdered his own father, before .the coming
o f Jefus Ghrift; •
Common mafons have been accuftamed to
regard St, John as their patron, and to cele­
brate the. feftival of that faint. Cagiioftro
alfo adopted him as his prote&or; and it is not
a little remarkable, that he was imprifiioed at
Rome on the yety nafpe„day of his patron!
'T h e reafon for his veneration to this «great
prophet way, if we are to believe himfelf, the
great fimilarity and conne&ion between the
Apocalypfe and the rites of his inftitutibn.
W e mnft here ob&rve, that when any of
his difcipks were admitted into the higheft
clafs, the following execrable ceremony took
place, A young boy or girl, in the ftate o f
virgin innocence and purity, was procured, who
Was called the pupil, and to whom power was
given over the feven fpirits that furround the
throne of the divinity, and prefide over the

Gabriel, Uriel, Zobiachel, and Anachiel*.
The pupil is. then made ufc of as an interme­
diate agent between the. fpiritual and phyiical
world} and, being'clothed in a long white
robe, adorned with a red ribbon,, and blue fille,
feilodnsj'he is fhutup in a little clofct< From that
place he gives refponies to the grand matter,
and tells whether the fpirits and Mofes have
agreed to receive the candidate into the higheft
clafs of Egyptian mafons. t
It is not a little remarkable, that, in every
part o f his fyftem o f maibnry, Caglioftro has
exhibited the mod' profound veneration and
refpeft'for the patriarch Mofes ; arid yet that,
on his examination,' he affirmed before his
judgçs, he had. adwayveheriihedshe mod
inveterate, antipathy- againft him. He attri­
buted this hatred to an'opinion which-he had
early imbibed, that Mofos had committed the
grofleft injuftice ib'encouraging thé Israelites
to carry away with, them the ornàtaent^ of the
Egyptians { and,- notwithftanding- our utmott;

error, he~has always remained obftinate in Ids
heterodoxy. His wife affirms, that his hatred to
this great lawgiver proceeded from his conftant
reflifal-to encourage him in his mafonry, H e
loved the Jews however exceedingly, and was
tiled'to affirm that they were the beft nation in
the world. . . . •
In his inftru&ions to obtain the moral and
fhyfical regeneration which he had promifed
to his difciplesj he is exceedingly careful to
give a.minute defcription of the operations to
which they are to fubmit. Thofe who* are de-
iirou$.of experiencing, the moral regeneration,
are-to retire for forty days from the world, and
to diftribute their time into certainUpróptfftions.
Six hours are to be employed in reflexion, three
inprayer to the Divinity, nine in the holy opera­
tions of Egyptian mafonry > and the remaining
period is to be dedicated to repofe. A t the end
o f thirtyT-three days' a vifible communication
is to

feven primitive fpirits j and on the mbrning o f
the fortieth day his foul will be infpired with
divine knowledge, and h|s body be as pure as
that of a new-born innocent. -
T o procure a phyfical regeneration, the pa­
tient is to retire to the country in the month o f

to be takeri 'from the arm before fuo-rtfe, and
th* patient is to retire to bed till the operation
is completed. A grain of the panacea is then
■ to be taken; .this panacea is the famfroot o f

him immortal. When this is fwalkwSed, the
candidate lofes his fpeech and his reftc&ion

quent convulftonsi ftjruggles, and perfpiration*.
H aying recovered from this date, in which
however he experiences no pain whatever, on

grain of -the panacea, -which caufes him to fall
into a .profound and tranquil deep i it is then
that he lofes hil hair, his (kin, aiwLhis teeth.

who eroded their fwords. in the air while he
walked under them. He prefided over thele

In this lodge he pronounced an eulogium on
Egyptian mafonry, which had a vifible effeft1

foon after requefted to found a lodge for wo­
men, which he accordingly inftituted with great

From thé Hague he repaired to Venice/
where he alfo leagued himfelf with the free
mafons. Haring left that city, he determined
to viflt Prulfia j and* in palling through N u­
remberg, happened to (top at an inn in that
place. Another ftranger having ftopi ahb to

' quired his efteem to fuch a degree by his mar­
vellous relations, that, on parting,- he prefentêd
him with a diamond ring.
During his fhort refideflce at Berio* he
found his arts raeffieftual to debauch any o f
the lodges in that capital, as the vigilance o f
Frederic the Great rendered aU his attempts
abortive.
A t Leipfic, however, he was more luccefsful,
as he acquired a high celebrity and renown there
on account of his pretended difcoveries in the
hermetic art. The free malbns in particular
treated him with the molf diftinguiihed honour

placed three and-three, in commemoration of
the holy Trinity; On this, as on all other
fimilar occafions, he made a fpeech, in which
he enumerated the excellencies and advantages
o f his Egyptian mafonry; combated the im­
piety and profanenefs of that of his entertainers;
and prophelied that Scieffort, the grand matter,
before the expiration of that very month, would *
experience the vengeance of the Divinity. Not-
withftanding this, they not only paid all the ex­
pences which he had incurred in that city, bat
alfo prefented him with a purfe o f gold on his
departure.
A t Dantzic he received the fame honours,
and the fame refpe£t: at Koenigfberg alfo he
was loaded with favours. But he confeffes
that, in both thefe cities, he perceived that
the free mafons were inimical to the ruling
powers, and plotted their deftru&ion.
Having proceeded to Mitcau, among other
circumftances which contributed to exalt his
reputation, and conciliate the affe&ion of peo­
ple of diftinftion, was the completion of his
prophecy refpe&ing Scieffort, who killed him-

numerous, and all of thetjv men óf rank and
diilin&ioo, invited him to their lodges, where
he prefided as grand mailer. He perceived
here, as elfewhere, that their ceremonies were
disfigured and difgraced by magic, fuperfti-
tion; the principles of Swedenburg, a Swediih
preacher; and thofe of M. Falc, a Jew rabbi,
who are regarded as chiefs by the illumi­
nated* He wiihed to undeceive them, and to
initiate them in the rites of his Egyptian ma-
fonry : for this purpofe he founded a lodge for
men and women among them, according to;the
ceremonial laid down in his book. As grand
mailer, he directed all the rules and regulations
of the fociety ; and (as he fays) fpoke with his
ufual energy and eloquence, being fupported
and afiiiled by the infpiration of God : but, as
he found it exceedingly difficult upon this
occafion to convince his audience of the truth
of his aiTertions, he' determined to give them
the moil fatisfa&ory proofs of the verity of die
piaxims which he inculcated ; that is to fay, of
the exiftence of a Deity, andthe immortality of
the foul.
« I accordingly,” fays Caglioilro, ** defired
that a little child, the fon of a perfon of dif-
tindlion, might be introduced to the lodge.

which a cryftal vafe of pure water was placed,
and behind the vafe feveral wax tapers were
burning. I then put my hand upon his head,
and befoughc the Divinity to afiift us by
means of his omnipotent power. This cere­
mony being finifhed, the child was defired to
look into the vafe; on which he obeyed, and
inflantly exclaimed that he beheld a fíne gar­
den. On this 1 took courage, and defired
that he might pray to God to enable him to
fee the angel Michael. The child then faid
that he faw fomething white, but could not
diftinguifh what it was. In a few moments
after he began to clap his hands, and ftrike his
feet againfl the floor, crying out, *I perceive
a little child, who looks like an angel and
inflantly attempted a deferiptioo, fuch.as
is ufually given of heavenly beings. On
this the aflcmbly, who had hitherto remain­
ed fílent, buril forth into loud acclamations;
but the father of the child, being defírous to
make another experiment, requeued that he
might know what his daughter, who was then,
at a country houfe fifteen miles diflant, was
doing. The fame ceremonies haying again
taken place, the boy once more turned towards
the vafe, and obferved that his fillerwas at that

brace another of her brothers. This circum-
ftance appeared incredible to the audience, as
the brother alluded to was fuppofed to be
feveral hundred miles diftant. I was not how­
ever daunted by this circumftance, for 1 defired
them to fend a perfon inftantly to the country,
on purpofe to verify the faft : this was accord­
ingly done; and it was proved to the fatisfoc-
tion of all prefent that the young gentleman
had at the very moment indicated arrived from
a foreign country, and vifited and embraced
his filter.”
The homage, the attachment, nay, the ado­
ration, which he and Madam Caglioftro pre­
tend to have received upon this occafion, beg­
gar all defeription and belief.
A lady of quality hearing of this ftory, de-
fired that one of his pupils might fee the fpirit
of a brother, to whom, during his life-time, Ibe
had.been, particularly attached; this was ac­
cordingly done-; and he appeared with io happy
and contented a countenance, that the filter,
being fully allured that he was in the full en­
joyment ôf the blellings of Paradife, became
exceedingly generous upon the occafion, and
rewarded Caglioftro very handfomely for his
prédirions. -
Being now refolved to leave this city, he

held a lodge for the laft time; during which
he appointed his fucceflor, nominated the other
officers, gave them the neceflary inftrudtions
for the exercife of their various fundtions, and.
' difmified the aficmbly with a prophecy. In
this he aiTerted that one of his female con­
Verts would be married to a wealthy gentle­
man in the courfe of three months j an occur­
rence which, it feems, adtually took place.
Overwhelmed, as it were, with the honours,
and loaded with the riches prefented him by
his difciples, he now repaired to St. Peterf-
burgh. The celebrity of his name had already
anticipated his arrival, and he was received
into alt the lodges as a tutelary divinity.
Among other uncommon circumftances, he
difcovered a fecret intrigue between an uncle
and a niece; he prophefied'the future misfor­
tunes of a great prince; and foretold to a
young lady the melancholy ctrcumftance of
her approaching death. “ I uttered all thefe
predidtions,” faid he to his judges, “ in confe-
quence of divine infpiration $ but I always pre­
tended that it was by means of my cabaliftical
knowledge that 1 was enabled to difclofe thefe
fecrets.”
He was no lefs fuccefsful at Warfaw, if
we' are to give credit to his aiTertions, as he

there received innumerable marks of refpeft
and efteem; and more efpecially from fome of
the molt illuftrious people attached to the
court. The birth-day of his lady was cele­
brated in the molt brilliant manner; and all
the grandees fent her magnificent prefents on
the occafion.
. Among others» he had formed a drift inti­
macy with a magnate, whom he endeavoured
to convert from the common to the Egyptian
mafonry, by means of one of hispupils, and a
vaje filled w ith Jpring water j but, notwithftand-
ing this, the nobleman remained firm-in his
belief. '
Such was his fuccefs at Stralburgh, that he
refided there for feveral years; during which
time he pretends to.have performed wonders
in the medical art. His cures were fo miracu­
lous, that his houfe was foon full of crutches,
which were left there by fuch lame patients as
had recovered the ufe of their limbs. But his
reputation was more powerfully fupported and
increafed by means of his Egyptian mafonry.
He converted a prodigious number from the
common mafonry, and even admitted fe­
veral difciples, who were totally ignorant of
the myfteries of that art. Men, women, Ca­
tholics, Lutherans, Calvinifts, were all indifcri-

of his new inttitution. He often held lodges
in a houfe in town ; fometimes in a little
country refidence, d ohtfully fityRte at a few
miles dittance, which has preferved to this very
day the name of Cagliostrano.
On thefe occafions he made a dexterous ufe
of h\spupils; and, befides the vafe, introduced a
folding fcreen in the form of a temple ; within
which heplacedone ofthechildren who werefup-
pofed to have a divine intercourfe, and intended
to make the proper refponfes to all the quef-
tions propounded by the grand matter. Thefe
pradtices were made ufe of to difcover events .
paft, prefent, and to come; and fometimes to
refolve queftions but very little fuited either to
the delicacy or modefty of a female audience.
As on one of thefe occaGons the audience
fufpecled an intercourfe between his pupils and
him, he defired them to nominate a child
whom hehad neverbefore ften, and with whom
he pretends that he had the moft complete
fuccefs.
From Straibyrgh, where his milGon was
attended with fuch uncommon advantages, he
proceeded to Naples * but he reGfted all the
invitations which were made him to vittt the

didates of both fexes in the myfteries of his
Egyptian inftitutions. He adds-that, whilethere,

. At Paris he was alfo prevailed upon, by the
entreaties of his numerous difciples, to found
Another lodge. He accordingly hired an hotel,
and furnilhed it with amagnificence equal to that
of the princes of the blood royal. He prefided
there, as the founder and grand mafter; and
made ufe of two pupils, a boy and a girl, one
of which faw and recounted the vifions in the

‘•ardent wiihes for his happinefs, and even de­
manded his benediftion. He allures us that
he did not refufe this teftimony of his regard,
but gave it daily to all his adherents who
demanded it.

and being at length prevailed upon to gratify
' their wiihes, he received feveral perfons of rank
into the afiociation, and made ufe of theminiftry
of (ourpupils, of diftinguifhed birth. On this
occafion a fingular accident occurred to him,
the caufe of which he pretends to be entirely
ignorant of. Some ladies and gentlemen having
petitioned for authority to make ufe ofthe cryftal
voft, &c. in the fame manner as himfelf, he
granted his permiifion accordingly; but their
labours proved fo unfortunate, that they beheld
the apparitions of monkeys and devils, inftead
of angels, as they expected.
Being at length obliged to leave London,
as we mentioned before, he remained for two
weeks

weeks at a lodging which he had in the coun­
try, and prepared himfelf by a variety of ex­
periments for future fuccefs.
On his arrival at Bafil in Switzerland, he
was preiTed by a great number of the inhabi­
tants to eftablilh an Egyptian lodge in his
houfe. Being unable to refufe fuch a flattering
requeft^ he furnilhed one of his apartments
in the form of atemple, fo as nearlyto refemblc
the inflde of his lodge at Lyons, except that
it was neither io rich nor io magnificent; and
this he termed the mother lodge o f the Helvetic
States. He received feveral men and women
into this fociety, with the ufual ceremonies
and formalities ; he employed pupils of both
fexesj and having admitted a huiband and
wife into a fuperior clafs, he empowered them
to perform the various myfteries, with the
fame fuccefs as himfelf. To give a regular
and confiftent form to the eftablilhment, he. '
appointed five grand officers, and prefented
them with a patent; different however in its
import from that which he had formerly given
to the lodge at Lyons, not having anyemblems
engraven on it, or any other motto than the
word God placed at the top,
Befides this, he left many traces of his refi-
dence in that city behind him; and among
w others

others a Chinefe pavilion, which he built on
purpofe to experience the effe&s of his phyfical
and moral regeneration. It remains at this
very day; and fuch is the veneration of the
peafants in regard to this pretended prophet,
that it is faid they pay their homage and
adoration to him on palling this temple, which
they denominate the maufoleum of Count
Caglioltro.
At Bienne, to which he afterwards repaired,
he allb held feveral Egyptian lodges, and as
tifual made ufe of hispupils. At Aix, Turin,
Genoa, and Verona, he held repeated confer­
ences with feveral malons. At Roveredo he
pretends that many perfons were fo charmed
with the fecrets which he difclofed, and
the eloquence with which he enforced his
do&rines, that they prevailed upon him to
hold a lodge in a country houfe in the neigh­
bourhood of that city, in which he performed
the various functions andceremonies prefcribed
by the inftitutions. The patent on this occa-
lion was dated in the year 5781 j by which
it appears that, like the mafons, he aifumed
a different asra from that of the chriltians.
From Roveredo Caglioltrorepaired toTrent,
and from thence to Rome. Trent does not

was exceedingly afraid of the great piety of
the prince bilhop. He however did not en­
tirely forget his attachments; for he caufed
two folding fcreens to be made for his pupils,
although they were not made ufe of.
But he never was in fuch a great perplexity
as in Rome. We have already mentioned
that on one hand he was intimidated by the
vigilance of the governmentj while he was
prefled on the other by his zeal for mafonry,
and by the extreme indigence which he be­
gan to experience. '
Having learned that there was a lodge ef-
tabliihed in that city, he got acquainted with
ieveral of the members, but he conllantly
refufed to afiift at their aflemblies. He how­
ever partook of a repail to which they invited
him in the country, during which he pro­
nounced adifeourfe in honour of Egyptian ma­
fonry. He experienced a particular pleafure in
convening with them ; and they in return
evinced the ilrongeil defireto be initiated in his
Egyptian rites. He conduced himfelf in fuch
a manner as to enforce this hope; he often
read to them that paflage of his book, in
which his fyilem is detailed j he explained
many of the myfteries, and even permitted
one of them to copy feveral of.the particulars.

Neverthelefs 'he forebore to receive them
publicly as his difciples, promifing however
to admit them on his leaving the papal
territories. In the mean time he procur­
ed the admiifion of many members into the
lodge already eftabliihed : fuch indeed was the
refpeit they habitually entertained for him,
that they at length gave him the appellation of
father,*' while he in return called them
his “ children;*' in fine, they looked upon him
as their chief, and adtually paid him all the
homage ufually conferred on a grand matter.
He alfo continued his correfpondence, by
means of words and fymbols known tb and
ufed by the mafons, with the lodges that he
had ettabliihed in foreign countries. Among
other letters written in that manner, is one
addrefled to a Parifian, requefting him to pro­
cure a fumof money from a third perfon. He
defired this correfpondent to intereft himfelf in
the bufinefs, and endeavour by all poftible
means to obtain a happy conclufion ofit; pro­
mifing in return to conftitute him his vicar
general, with unbounded powers.
In the mean time, his wants became every
day more preffing, and no remittances what­
ever arrived. At length, neceffity getting the
better of his fears, his diftrefs forced him to

make an offer to feveral perfons of inftru&ing
them in his Egyptian mafonry, and he alfo
endeavoured to found a lodge for ladies. His
firft defign was attended with little or no fuc-
cefsj and he was difliiaded from his fecond, be-
caufe he was given tounderffand that at Rome
cither the ladies have very little money, or
they are exceedingly unwilling to part from it.
There was one perfon, however, who feemed
exceedingly defirous to become one of his dif-
ciples j and Caglioftro was uncommonly eager
to enrol him in the lift, on account of a ring,
the brilliancy of which fafcinated his eyes, and
made him ogle it with uncommon defire. Not-
withftanding his wonderful knowledge of na­
ture, he never difcovered that the ftones were
cryftal in(lead of diamonds.
Having introduced this fuppofed dupe into
his bed-chamber, he informed him that the
knowledge which he had acquired in Egypt*
enabled him to eftabliih a fyftem of mafonry,
to which no perfon could be admitted without
a long and rigorous initiation ; but that he,
as fupremc grand matter, could difpenfe with
the ufual forms. Accordingly he pronounced
a difcourfe, pointing out the fuperiority and
advantages of Egyptian mafonry above all
others; and then defiring him to fall on
. his

his knees, and lift his right hand towards his
head, in this attitude he obliged him to fwear
never to reveal or difcover to any perfon what
he had either feen or heard. He then pro­
ceeded to breathe on his face, and to perform
theufual ceremonies as on the admiffionofother
candidates; but when he prefented him with
a patent, and claimed the promifed reward, the
mafon-eleit inftantly walked away, obferving,
with great calmnefs, that the whole was a con­
temptible impofture. Thus Caglioltro, whohad
gained immenfe fums by his rogueries inevery
other part of Europe, was not able at Rome to
procure even a ring fet with falfe ftones, by
means of all his art and abilities!
Soon after this he began to experience the
molt alarming inquietude arifing fromhis dread
of being betrayed. He acknowledges that hfe
now determined to throw himfelf at the feet of
a prieft, and acknowledge his faults. Accord­
ingly he confeiTed his crimes in this capital, in
the fame manner as he had formerly done at
Trent; and actually declared to two perfons
who enjoyed his confidence, that it was on
purpofe to ridicule the holy lnquifition that
he had fubmitted to that ceremony. He at
length crowned his mafonic labours by a cir­
cular letter, which he wrote a few days before
his

his detention, to all the Egyptian lodges. Soon
after he received intelligence that he had been
accufed to the Holy Office; but he had great
confidence in the zeal of his difciples, whom
he ordered to fet fire to the Caftle of St.. An­
gelo, or even to the Inquifition, in cafe he
ihould be detained there.
W e have thus given an abridgment of the
labours of Caglioftro, in his chara&er of a free
mafon: our narrative contains the fubftance of
his confeffions on that fubjeft, which we have
here reduced to method; and have endeavoured
to avoid tedioufnefs and languor, by detailing
only the principal circumftances. It now re­
mains to elucidate the particulars which we
have related, by clearing up the difficulties and
obfcurities which his hiftory will undoubtedly
prefent to the mind of every reader.
Some will aik how it comes about that fuch
an artful impoftor as Caglioftro, who, during
his trial at Paris, had remained obftinately bent
on deception, could be prevailed upon to be­
tray himfelf at Rome ? And how a wretch
who had been fo fuccefsful by means of his im-
poftures in every city in Europe, ihould at length
be induced to make a full and free confeffion
of them ? The recolle&ion of a fimple fa£t
will eafily reconcile thefe circumftances. Not-
K ' withftanding

JJO T H E L I F E OF
withftanding the repeated intelligence that he
received of his approaching confinement, he
negle&ed to deftroy the book which contained
his fyftem of Egyptian mafonry, the various
ornaments and apparatus belonging to that rite,
and all the correfpondence which he carried
on with the feveral lodges, of which he was
either the founder or an affociate. A t the mo­
ment of his arreft, he beheld every paper that
could inform or enlighten his judges in regard
to his former life, fealed before his eyes : it was
therefore impoffible, or at leaft ufelefs, to deny,
or even tp palliate, thefe circumftances; fince an
irrefragable body of evidence was thus obtained,
and full and fufficient proofs could be adduced
in a moment to fubftantiate the crimes of which
he was accufed.
' It ought alfo to be added, that, from the ex-
ceflive garrulity of Caglioftro, many things oc­
curred in the courfe of his trial, that cleared
up and elucidated feveral cxprefEons in his
tnanufcripts, which, without this help, would
have remained fo many enigmas. On thefe
occafions he often attempted to tergiverfate
and to rccal his expreflions ; but this was impof-
fible : for his judges had taken the precaution,
to make him fign his interrogatories page by
page; and alfo to declare, at the bottom o f
. each,
V
C O U N T C A G L I O S T R O . I 3 I -
each, that the declarations therein contained
were entirely conformable to the particulars of
his confelfion. Another cifcumftance which
did not a little contribute to the happy con-
clufion of his procefs, was the precaution with
which he was ihut up in the place of his con­
finement. A t the Baftille, as he himfelf ‘
frankly acknowledged, he had found the moil
ample means of prevarication, of eluding the
charges adduced againft him, and of corrupting
his guards, and even the minifters of juftice,
by means of money. But, during his impri-
fonment here, he has found all his arts and all
his refources fail him for the firil time. Indeed,
on his being arrefted, it was induftrioufly pro­
pagated in this capital, that the per&n to whofe
care he had been entrufted was his friend and
prote&or: but 'this was difeovered to be a
mere calumny; as the judge who firft examin­
ed him tried by every means in his power to
difeover whether any fecret communication had
taken place ; and, after a long and laborious '
enquiry, he brought in a report, by which it
evidently appeared that this accufation was no­
thing lpore than a-groundlefs and a malicious
ftory.
But it may itill be demanded how it came
about that he acknowledged fo many particu-
• K 2 lars

* T H E L I F E OF
lars relative to his Egyptian mafonry ? To this
it is to be anfwered, that his firft attachment
to the common and ordinary mafonry; the
celebrity, the afcendancy, the credit, which he
had acquired in the lodges appertaining to it ¡
the invention, or at lead the reformation, of
Egyptian mafonry } the abundance of his dif-
ciples of both fexes, and the propagation of his
doctrines in all parts ofthe world-"—were fo many
fa&s, that, as it was impofiible to deny, he
thought it prudent to acknowledge and confefs.
But in addition to his own evidence, not only
his wife, who was his infeparable companion,
has confirmed this circumftance, but his papers
havefurnilhed the moll incontrovertible proofs:
and, in addition to thefe, we have been fur-
niihed with the evidence Of a traveller, who ar­
rived in this metropolis during his procefs;
and who allures us that he himfelf, during his
rcfidence at Lyons, faw the magnificent tem­
ple eretted for the exercife of the Egyptian
rites inftituted by Caglioftro, in the middle o f
which was placed a marble bull of the founder. ,
Perhaps the details given us on this fubjefl
by himfelf may be exaggerated, as by thefe
means he' hoped to acquire an importance
which might be ufeful to him. The nurriber
of his difciples, whom he affirmed amounted to
many

many millions, is another circumftance which
it is difficult to believe, and which muft have
undoubtedly been aliened on purpofe tom ake
himfelf appear formidable. The evidence be­
fore us proves that the number of his followers
was confiderable j but they fell far ihort of
what he pretended : and it is no lefs certain that
they are daily diminifhing, as they at length
begin to perceive and acknowledge the im-
pofture and deception of their grand mafter. It
however is well known that the defertion of his
followers never gave him any concern, as it was
their money rather than their attachment that
he was ambitious of.
It would be difficult to comprehend the
uncommon fuccefs which he experienced, if
it were not recollected that he procured the
greater part of his profelytes in countries where
either the remiflhefs of the government, or the
natural depravation of the human heart, had
enfeebled the foundations pf the catholic faith.
It is alfo to be confidered, that he was not fo
little verfed in intrigue as to negledt the moft
artful means for the fuccefs of his million.
Thus he was moft anxious to choofe the ig­
norant and the rich for his difciples ; and was
particularly careful to debauch and corrupt the
heart, by feconding and affifting the ruling paf-
K 3 „ fxons
D

fions of his converts. Over the minds of fuch
weak people as pretended to be attached to the
fciences, his chemical difcoveries, and the
promife of the philofopher’s {tone, afforded
never-failing means of fuccefs. If any one,
deterred by the influence of his paflions, can­
didly confefied his attachment to the fair fex,
he conftantly replied, that, to become a good
Ipafon, or, what was the fame thing, to become
a perfeSI man, it was not neceflary to be a
capuchin. “ Live as you pleafe,” he ufed
to exclaim; “ and only believe in me, and in
my Egyptian mafonry !” By thefe means, and
with fuch maxims, his fuccefs could not fail
being equally rapid and extenflve.
It may be alfo neceflary to obferve, that one of
the indifpenfable conditions annexed to the ad-
miifion into the Egyptian fyftem, was that of
having been already eledted into one of the
lodges of ordinary mafonry. The motive of
this is not difficult to be difeovered; for as his
inftitution was entirely new, and the principal
and moft wonderful circumftance attendant on
it was the phyflcal and moral regeneration, it
was more eafy to inveigle the free mafons, whofe
minds were already debauched, than any other
clafs of men whatever j and he indeed found
that it was not difficult to make thefe be­

üeve in thole marvellous tales and prodigious
events that exceeded poffibility, and gave thé
lye to the operations of nature.
The reader will undoubtedly recoiled that
Caglioftro pretended to have harangued his au­
dience for feveral hours, with an eloquence that
at once charmed and convinced them ; and with
a fublimity that evinced a prodigious attainment
in regard to all kinds of knowledge either fa-
cred or profane. He alfo pretended to have
been fo fuccefsful in his arguments, that, by
means of his difcourfcs, the wicked were turned
afide from their wickednefs, were made to be­
hold the fun of righteoufnefs, and to embrace
the catholic religion. His wife, however, who
was prefent at a great number of his difcourfes,
affirms that they were compofed in a ftyle of
the mod wearifome perplexity, and abounded
with the moil incoherent ideas. Previous to his
afcending the roilrum, he was always careful to
prepare himfelf for his labours by means of fome
bottles of wine; and he was fo ignorant as to the
fubjeft on which he was about to hold forth,
that he generally applied to his wife for the text
on which he was to preach to his difciples. If to *
thefe circumftances are added a Sicilian dialedl,
mingled with a jargon of French and Italian,
we cannot heiitate a fingle moment as to the

degree of credibility which we are to'give tp
the afiertions that have been made concerning
the wonder-working effedts of his eloquence.
H e admitted thoie profeffing all forts of reli­
gions to partakeof the bleifings of his divine dif-
coveries; provided they believed in the exiftence
of a God, and the immortality of the foul, it
was equal to him whether they were Catholics,
Lutherans, Calvinifts, or Jews. While (peak­
ing of fovereigns, he was always careful to
accommodate himfelf to the genius of his au­
dience ; fometimes infinuating fubordination,
but more frequently independence. He was
always accuitomed to fpeak in a contemptuous
manner of the perfon and authority of the Ro­
man pOntiff, and of all hierarchies whatever.
In fine, his difcourfes tended entirely to change
catholics into mifcreants, and atheifts into
deifts. •

by the colouring which we have given to it.
W e are in pofielfion of the teftimony of

his meaning. The judge who interrogated him
has often been obliged toJuffer the -pmijhment of
hearing his long replications, it being utterly

Is it poflible that a man, who from his very

firft rudiments of fcience in abhorrence, who
from his earlieft youth, and through the whole
courfeofhis life, had attached himfelf to no

ledge, which is reported to have formed the

himfelf from the holy facraments, of his conti­
nual violation of the precepts of the church,
and of all the circumitances which conftitute
that enormous mafs of crimes with which his
whole life is ftained and disfigured. It mud:
however be acknowledged that an immenfe
number of his difciples to this very day cele­
brate his eloquence as iomething beyond the
reach of mortality, and aftually approaching
to our notions of what is divine!— How has
this happened ? It proceeds Amply from this,
that blindnefs attaches itfelf to blindnefs ; and
that thefe ignorant people, being unable to com­
prehend his difeourfes on account of their ob-
feurity, have imagined that their leader fpoke
parabolically and enigmatically; and thus they
had an ample opportunity of interpreting his
fentiments according to their own wiihes.
His prediftions, no doubt, tended greatly to
augment their fanaticifm. He attributed theie
to the fpecial afliftance of the Deity himfelf,
and to the effefts of his immediate infpiration*.
H is wife, however, has been able to affign the
caufe of many of his miraculous prophecies} for
ihe accounts for fome of them by the infatiable
curiofity and diligence which he made ufe of
to procure a knowledge of the fecrets of all
families whatever; and attributes others to a

forefight founded upon faCts, from whence an
inference might be fairly drawn. For example,
if at Mittau he prophefied that a young lady
would be foon united to a wealthy huiband, he
founded this prediction on the knowledge of
the regard thht a man of fortune fecretly enter­
tained for her; and if at another time he fore­
told the fpeedy difiolution of another perfon,
this arofe merely from the ftate of the patient’s
health, whofe malady might have eafily infpired
the fame idea in the breaft of arty medical per­
fon whatever.
Let us now fay fomething concerning his
wonderful operations by means of his pupils,
It is certain that Caglioftro himfelf, as well as
others, has often made ufe of thefe pupils in
his Egyptian mafonry ; and that the boys and
girls employed on this occafion have pretended
to have feen angels, and to have held an in-
tercourfe with the world of fpirits. How has
this happened ?
Caglioftro, according to cuftom, has boldly
and intrepidly afifured us that all this originated
from the fpecial protection of the Divinity}
that the Supreme Being had deigned to grant
him the
. beatific vijtoti, on purpofe to enable him
more effectually to propagate and enforce his
Egyptian mafonry, to prove the exiftence of

the incredulous, and to fuccour and fupport
the Catholic faith. H e alfo added that, on
thefe occafions, he had always an opportunity
of ftrengthening his belief in God, of invok­
ing his beneficence, and of experiencing his
bounty.
Let us, on the other hand, hear the depofi-
tions of his wife. She declared upon oath
that many of the pupils had been prepared be­
forehand by her huiband, and had their lelTon
given them in regard to every qUeftion about
which they were to be afterwards interrogated :
but that fome however had been chofen and
brought unawares to him ; and that, in re­
gard to them, ihe imagined that he could only
operate by the intervention of magic. She
alfo added, that he had repeatedly refufed to
communicate the means by which he achieved
thefe operations; always obferving, that ihe did
not poffefs fufficient courage and refolution for
the fuccefs of the myftery ■
, and that, when he
himfelf began with his pupils, he conftantly
ftruck the ground three times with his right foot,
exclaiming, “ I do this in confequence of the
power which I derive from the Grand Cophte!”

towards the advancement of his intereft; for
he generally flattered his audience by making
their deceafed relations and friends appear in
his magic vqfe, as enjoying fupreme happinefs ;
while, on the contrary, thofe who were his ene­
mies were condemned to eternal torments.
Sometimes, alfo he inftru&ed his pupils to de-
fcribe the good angels, who appeared to them,
as poflefling the features,' and bearing an exalt
refemblance to Madam Caglioftro, fo that his
friends might have a greater attachment to her.
The gazette; writers of Europe were at great
pains to ridicule all this, as the mere trick of a
juggler; and as for us, who have fo many ift-
llances of his impofture before our eyes, we
cannot withhold our aflent to the fame opinion.
Among the papers belonging to Caglioftro we
have found two relative to this pretended inter-
courfe .with fpirits, which were tranfmitted to
him during his imprifonment; and which feem
to have been written either with a view of de­
manding information, or of giving an account
of the proceedings of his difciples.

We ordered Caglioftro to explain theie pa­
pers to us: but he faid that, as to the purport
of the firft, he himielf remained in profound
ignorance; for this man', who pretended to be
infpired, favoured, and protefted in a particu­
lar manner by God, was obliged to confeis
that, on this, as on many other occattons, he
1 was

was entirely unacquainted with the meaning of
his correfpondent. '
As to the fecondj he pretended that it ,was
the narrative of a vifion that had appeared in
the nightj butthat hedid not believe it any more
s than another, the account ofwhich was fent him
from Lyons, in which he himfelf was defcribed *
as having appeared between Enoch and Elias.
Being unable to penetrate into the recedes
of the human heart, it is impoifible to decide
on the veracity of his anfwer: we learn how­
ever from his .wife that he ufed to obferve to
his difciples, if they now dreamed that they
faw him in the clouds, thofe dreams would
be a&ually realized hereafter; for they lhould
hereafter, behold him there, furrounded with
glory.
We (hall here add a few queftions which we
aiked him upon this occaiion.
Q;, Have you ever doubted as to the pro­
** priety of exercifing the rites of your Egyp.
“ tian mafonry ?
** A. Ever fince I left London I have been
** in great doubt whether it was not impro-j
“ per. •
“ Did you ever forbid your difciples to
** write to you on this fubjedt while you re­
“ mained in Italy ? .
L a “ A . Yes.
D
ig

148 T H I L I F E o i
««A. Yes.
c
< Why ?
“ A. Bccaufe I knew that the rites of the
“ Catholic religion were univerfally pra&ifed
“ throughout Italy; and that, in other coun-
u tries, there were a variety of religions.
** Is the Egyptian mafonry then in oppo-
“ fition to the Catholic faith ?
A. I truly think fo; and principally in
that part of it which regards the pupils.
** How could you believe that' on thefe
** occafions, you were affifted by the fpecial
** favour of God ?
** A. I do not underftand what you lay—I
**do not rightly comprehend my own meaning
ts —I can only fay, that I lament my unhap-
“ py fituation, and demand fpiritual affiftance.
" I have been led into a hundred thoufand
“ errors in regard to religion."
This repentance however was only momen­
tary in its duration and effeft, being merely
intended to procure time to ftudy an anfwer.
When clofely urged on the fame fubjeft on
two other occafions, he perfifted in his firft de­
clarations, and attributed his fuccefs to the fpe-
cial intervention and affiftance of the Divinity.
However, after perfifting for fome time in
thefe queftions, and demanding a categorical
. anfwer,
D
ig
itiz
e
db
yGoogle
C OUNT C A p t l O S T R O . I49
aafwer, he again began to prevaricate;. Being
at length exhorted to tell the truth, and to
manifest the fecrets of his heart, he appeared
exceedingly agitated; and faid, “ that hehad
neyer employed the Devil in any of his opera­
tions, nor ever made ufe of any magic or fu-
perftition whatever.”
We have here given a ihort. abridgment of
this part of his trial; for it would fill feveral
volumes if we were to detail the queitions
which we made ufe of to make him give a full
and ample confelBon. Qur efforts however
were in vain* for when he found himfelfprefled
by the arguments we made ufe of, he inftantly
loft his temper, and abufed and menaced the
judges who examined him.
' ^Yhen the moft ample proofs of his impiety
were adduced, he pretended to juftify himfelf
in faying, “ I am an apoftolic catholic; and if
you do not believe me, I cannot help it.” On
another occaflon he exclaimed, “ I am a Ro­
man Catholic; and if you do not believe the
beatific vifiott, I do.” Being defirou; to hear
by what authority he pretended to have re­
ceived his million from God, and the power
to make ufe of his myftical operations, he re­
plied, “ that it proceeded from that divine
afliftance which the Deity had favoured him
2 with,
D
ig
itiz
e

I¿6 T P L I F E OF
with, as being a good catholic; and that he
had derived his authority from the power given
in that beatific vfien which Jefus had experi­
enced before his crucifixion: Ego claritatem
quam dedifti mihi dedi eis: nonfro bis rogo tanturn,
fed et fro eis qui credituriJunt fer verbum eorum
me, ut om
nes unumJint.”
It was obje&ed that this power was common
to all catholics : but he faid that all catholics
could not make ufe of it, becaufe their belief
in God was not fufficiently ftrong; adding,
that fome on whom he himfelf had conferred
this power could not fucceed, while others
never failed. .
“ What do you mean by the beatific
“ vifton?
“ A, A fpiritual affiftance, an angelic affift-
*e ance, a fupernatural affiftance.
On whom is it conferred ?
** A. God has given it, does give it, and
ihall give it to whomfoever he pleafes.
(C Qj_ In what manner does it operate ?
** A. In three manners: the firft is, when
*e God makes himfelf vifible, as he did to the
** patriarchs; the fecond is, by the appearance
** of angels who become vifible to men; and
** the third is, by internal impulfe and infpira-
f* tion. .
“ ( ¿ B y

C O U N T C A G L I O S T R O . 151
“ By what means is this obtained ?
** A. By a conftantunion with God, his holy
** church, and the catholic faith; and by the
** ties of faith and charity. When one poffeflfes
“ all thefe, it is only neceffary to petition for
u the divine afiiftance with fervent prayer; and
“ if this is not given to-day, the time will come
“ when it lhall be given. .
<
c Have any now living obtained this
“ vifion ?
“ A. I do not know any one, but I myfelf
“ who am a finner, W
ho have obtained it by
“ means of that internal impulfe, that is to
** fay, by the third manner, which I have juft
,e deferibed. •
“ How could a finner, how could a
ft wretch who has confeffed a perpetual viola­
** tion of ecclefiaftical precepts, and all manner
♦
*of iniquities, be able to obtain that grace,
te for the pofieflion of which it is abfolutely
ft neceffary to be always united to God and
(f to the Cathplic Church ?
(t A. I never had recourfe to the Devil; and
t( if I have been a finner, God, who is fo com-
t( paftionate, has, I hope, pardoned me,
“ Is it to be fuppofed that God would
(t have conferred this beatific vifion on your

** difciples, many of whom, by your own con­
** feffion, led immoral lives ?
“ A. I am but a man, and cannot therefore
« be fuppofed to enter into the reafons that
<( have influenced the Deity—he could fhower
“ down his grace upon whomhe pleafed, even
f t upon Tinners.”
After thefe queftions concerning the power
conferred on Caglioftro and his difciples, to
operate by means of the pupils, vajest fcrcens,
&c. &c. it will not be difficult to perceive
that the whole was a bare-faced impofture.
However, it mutt be confefled that he deceived
a prodigious number of people by means of
his pretended myfteries; and that they re­
garded him as a liipernatural being who had
defcended from Heaven. By thefe he was
looked up to as an oracle, and revered as a
model of virtue, wifdom, and power. To
fuch a height was the fanaticifm of lome of
his difciples carried, that he was often ad-
drefied by the titles of “ Adored Father and
Venerable Matter.” They conftantly kifled
his hand on approaching him; and were accuf-
tomed to kneel before him, and crave his
benedi&ion: in fine, they were all fubje£t to
his authority, as if he had been their fovereign.

« Sir and Mailer,
ff Nothing can equal the value of your be­

“ The brother Alexander Ter-----.”
** Auguft i, 1756.
A variety of other letters are written entirely
in the fame ftyle and mannerj it may be fairly
concluded therefore, that, if his difciples ad-
drefled him with fo much enthu(iafm during
his abfence, their refpeA and efteem muft
have been unbounded in his prefence. Indeed
he himfelf has acknowledged, that they often,
proftrated themfelves before him, and remain­
ed in that poiture upwars of an hour. On thefe
occafions he aded his part with wonderful
dexterity; for at the very time that he waa
gaining their affe&ions, by flattering their
paflions, he contrived to exhibit a grave, myf-
terious, and impoflng countenance. In fine,
he governed and directed them according to
his inclinations and caprice.
We lament exceedingly, and from the bottom
of our heart, that any clafs of men Ihould
have fallen into fuch a vile and difhonourable
vaflalage. But, after having read this hiftory,
will they perfift in their errors ? W ill they
not find fufficient motives for detaching them­

formed in regard to the charaiter of Caglioftro*
the bafenefs of his defigns, and the wicked-
nefs of his myfteries ?
But we ihall once more return to our nar­
rative. On his firft examination he was violent
in his inve&ives againft the court of France,
to the intrigues of which he attributed all the
misfortunes that he had experienced (ince his
impriibnment in the Baftille, and alfo the de-
fe&ion of his wife, who had been corrupted
on purpofe to ruin him j the truth however
is, that Madame Caglioftro, inftead of ex­
periencing fuch a powerful protettion, would
have been reduced to extreme indigence} had
it not been for the penfion beftowed upon
her by the public treafury. The book of
Egyptian mafonry, the fymbols of that wicked
art, and the papers of Caglioftro, which form
fo many convincing and irrefragable proofs of
.his impiety, muft furely remove every fufpicion
from the minds of thofe who may have heard
that either fraud or injuftice were made ufe
of againft him.
He clearly perceived how n'eceffary it wa9
to throw fufpicions on the authenticity of
his wife’s evidence, becaufe he well knew
that lhe alone could difcover his moft fe-
cret crimes, and bring to light thole ini­
quities

quities of which mankind were before igno­
rant.
Neverthelefs he often teftified the moft
lively tendernefs and regard forTier, and was
exceedingly anxious to have her as a com­
panion in his confinement. It may be readily
believed that this demand was refufed by his
judges •
, as was alfo another, which was to be
removed to a larger prifon, and to be allowed
the liberty of writing : this latter was un­
doubtedly intended for the purpofe of keeping
up a correfpondence with his friends, fimilar
, to that which he had carried on during His con­
finement in Paris.
Deceived in thefe two projects, he affeCed
fincerity, and acknowledged that he had exer-
cifed the rites of Egyptian mafonry; affirming
that he formerly thought, and ftill cdhtinued to
think, that this fyftem wasCatholic, and that he
had exprefsly made ufe of it as ameans of pro­
pagating our religion. But he foon after re­
traced thefe fentiments, began to be apprehen-
five as to the good refulting from mafonry,
and to exhibit marks of repentance and contri­
tion. In addition to his firft demands, he now
requefled to have lbme more linen, a better
diet, and the liberty of perufing fome godly
book. We made no difficulty in latisfying

him as to the laft article ; and accordingly pre­
fenced him with ** The Defence of the Roman
Pontificate, and the Catholic Church, by P .
Nicholas-Mary Pallavicini.” In a few days
after he obferved of his own accord, in the
courfe of his interrogatories, that partly from
his own reflections, and partly from reading
of this book, he was now convinced that, in­
Head of contributing to the fervice of religion
and of the catholic church, his conduCt had
hitherto tended to extend the empire of Satan,
and to retard the falvation of fouls.
At length he expreffed himfelf in the fol*
lowing terms: ** Overwhelmed as I am with
horror and repentance, for having fpent forty-
five years of my life in that miierable ftate
of perdition and lamentable abyfs of error, I
am ready, on purpole to fave my foul, and to
repair the wrongs that I have committed
againft religion and the fouls of others, to
make fuch a declaration or retra&ion as may
be thought necelfary.
** And as there is an immenfe number
of my difciples in various parts of Europe,
who at my inftigation have adopted the Egyp­
tian fyftem of mafonry, and who are fo attach­
ed to that faith, and fo obedient to my orders,

neither the arguments nor the perfuafions of

aiide from the fyftem which I have taught
them—I amready to write and circulate the pre-
fentdeclaration, as it will tendtoenlightenthem.
“ I accordingly befccch your lordihips to

reign Pontiff, that his Holinefs may fee that
I have abandoned my errors.
“ I pardon my enemies, and all thofe who

tributed greatly to make me perceive the fins
into which I had fallen, and the miferable life
which I have palled, in error and incredulity,
during fomany years.”—-While fpeaking in this
manner, heappeared continually bathedin tears.
“ I d,o not defire,” added he, “ any thing but

fions and inftru&ions.”
• No perlón however believed that he (poke the
real fentiments of his heart, or that he was in*
ftucnced to this confelfion by an a&ual repen*
tance. Perhaps he flattered himfelf by thefe
means to get rid of the profecution, and to
recover his liberty. But whatever might be
his motives, this much is certain, that he foon'
perceived that hewas the dupe of his own arts;
for neither his place of confinement nor his
treatment was altered in any manner whatever.
His examinations, which had been interrupt*
edfor fome time, were afterwards refumed, on
the prefling inftances made by him to be heard

could induce the minifters of joftice to refule
him an audience, he had immediate permiflion

it hadfo much merit, that theSovereign Pontiff

He perlifted in thefe fubterfuges during his
lad interrogatories. It ought to be obferved,
however, that one of thofe padors•whom he
mentioned had been for fome time dead, and
could not therefore give him the,lye •, and.that,
as to the other, he was a perfon whom he had
feduced and deceived by means of a variety of
impodures. As to that part jn which he fpeaks
about forming his difciples in Egyptian ma­
fonry into areligious order, under the protec­
tion of his Holinefs, it is a grofs impofition. It
is however true, according to the confeilion of
his wife, that his followers at Straiburg wilhed
him to remain along ^ith them, and offered
to purchafe ahoufe which they intendedto con­
vert into a convent fo r majons, and in which they,
and their wives, who were to live in common
with all the difciples, propofed to relide.

that his pretended penitence was nothing.-more
than a mere, fubterfuge. During his firft ex-
amipatipns, he. confeffed.his errors, aflcnow-
ledged the wrongs which he; had; committed

he merited a fevere chaftifementj but he_ foon

pretended to be an apofUe, who, inflamed, with
jteal for religion, had laboured to propagate. A
fyftem which he then thought, and ftjll believed,
to be good, and which has a perfedt conformity
to the precepts of the church, Notwithftandjng
all this, in the courfe of his interrogatories he
confeffed— •

mental bails, a total indifference, as to the reli­
gion of the candidates. ...

of.the pa(tors whom he mentioned condemned
it as a ridiculous chiraara. :•
« That in addition, to this, he had felt
many fcruples of confcience in regard to his
fyftem; and well knew that in Italy, where the
catholic religion univerfally prevails, mafonry
is not permitted. '
“ 6. That at Trent he had adhered to
the counfels of his-confeffor, who had com*
manded him to abandon his Egyptian mafonry,
becaufe it was condemned by two bulls of the
Pope; that at Rome he had fallen at the feet of
a pried, and demanded abfolution; and that
he was determined to accufe hifnftlf to the

After the recapitulation of thefe fa&s, which
were admitted by himfelf, it will be eafy to
conceive the aftonilhing obftinacy, arid the hor­
rid impiety, with which this man was animated
in his zeal for mafonry.
But it may be here afked, of what religion
was this wretch, and in what did he really be­
lieve ? Properly fpe&king, he had no religion
at all. It appears at firft that his fyftem tended
towards deifm ; but, as intereft was the only divi­
nity which he worihipped, he conformed himfelf

a Calvinift, a Lutheran, but never a catholic«
H e would not indeed have heflcated a moment
to have exhibited an hypocritical compliance
in regard (b the duties of that holy religion, if
he could have drawn any advantage from it |
but he had no occafion to have recourfe to this
expedient, as he lived for the greater part, of
his life in thofe countries where its bleffings am
not experienced. In fine, he abhorred religion,
whether practical or theoretical.
During twenty-feven years of his life he was
never perceived to make the fign of the crofs,
nor to exhibit any other mark of religion j and
during that' whole period he did not approach
the holy facrament above three times. Indeed
it would have been much better if he had ab-
ftained even on thefe occafions, as he was in­
duced to thefe duties by. no other motives than
thofe of intereft and fear j whether it was at
Milan, with a view to obtain a paiTport for the
pilgrimage of St. James of Galicia} in Spain,
from a dread ofthe.Holy Officej or at Trent, to
deceive the Prince-Biihop by means of an af­
fected piety.

precepts of the church which enjoin the heaps’
ing of mafs on feftivals, and to faft, and ab-
ftain from fleih meat, on certain occafions.
Not content, as he himfelf acknowledges, to
leave thefe duties unfulfilled, he even induced
others to negleft them. In the courfe of his
hiftory we have had frequent opportunities to
fee with what wickednefs he expreffed himfelf
on all occafions as to morality, adultery, chafti-
ty, and other cardinal points of our religion.
The impious life which he led, and the prin­
ciples of that fyftem which he propagated, make
us fufficiently acquainted with the maxims
which he himfelf cherilhed, and wiihed to pro­
pagate.
This is the proper place to give an ■
account
of all the execrable do&rines which,he uttered
during his lafb refidence in Rome. His judges
have been occupied in collecting the proofs; but
we ihall not here recapitulate them, as it would
be highly improper-to fcandalize the public
by>the recapitulation of fuch blafphemies. It
is neceffary, however, that we ihould mention
three circumftances.
The firft is, that on all occafions he manifeited
the mod: obftinate hatred and contempt for the
catholic religion, its minifters, and ceremonies.
'He attacked the majefty and perfe&ion of God,

• The fecond, that, according to the evidence
of a great number of witnefles who have con-

who have done fo, he is unanimoufly repre-
fenced “ as a man deditute of religion, whofe

believe in any thing j and one wh§ is generally
considered as an atheid, an impofterr, a cheat,
-heretic, a deid, &c. abfolutelydevoyd of every
principle of religion and morality.” , ; ,

His trial being at length finiihed, it was
left to his own difcretion, either to employ the
eounfctlors ufually allotted to criminals, or to
ehoofe otherg j but he was contented with the
foil.
The knowledge and abilities of-Signor Gae­
tano Bernardini, an advocate of acknowledged
Worth and charadter, employed jn defence of
thole •aecufed'before the Holy Inquiikion, ren­
dered him every way eapable of undertaking his
defence. ¿uc to take away from the prifoner

foil the-moft noble Signor. Charles Lotus
Conftanttni, advocate for the poor in all the
tribunals' at Home. The world is well ac-
qoainted- with the charity, the zeal, and above
all the talents and abilities, with which he
«reifes this dignified employment.
But Caglioftro did not find in thefe defenders
the feme kind of advocates which he had ex­
perienced during h-is former trials. Far from

Seconding his tricks and impoftures-, they fpoke
to him in the language of truth, and (hewed him
the bad ftate of his caufe, and of his confidence.
H e began to perceive the unhappy end to
which his obftinate impenitence, and perfeve-
fance in error were ready to conduit him. H e
therefore requefted fpiritual fuccovw and inftruc-*
tion; thefe were accordingly provided for him,
and he was put under the guidance of » learned
and devout prieft, After the firft interview,
the culprit exhibited the moft lively marks of
contrition and repentance, and perfifted after­
wards in the fame fentiments.
' In the mean time his defence was. prepared
and publifhed. This pleading, at one and ths
fame time, exhibited the talents of. his counfel,
and the bad ftate of his caufe.
At length the day for paffing Judgment ar­
rived. This was preceded, like all the reft of
the .procefs, by the mpft Icrupulous aftd rigproqj
foFtns of juftice which are in ufoge in pqr Ofdw

and circumfpcfk adminiftration of the laws, and
evince to the culprits that they are not coat
demned without the moft minute and laborious
inveftigation.

the 2 1it of March 1791 j and according to
cuftom, before the Pope on the 7th of April
following. '
The judgment did not merit a long and
laborious difcuffion. Caglioilro himfelf had
avowed, and the moit convincing proofs had
demonltrated, that he was the reftorer and pro­
pagator! of Egyptian mafonry in many parts of
the world j that he had exercifed this fyftem
at Rome; and that he had admitted two per­
sons into its myfteries. • •
- It was in vain that he endeavoured to make
ufe of the fentiments and authority of thole;
who faid that the pains and puniihment award­
ed againft even an obftinate heretic, ought to
be commuted whenever he evinced unfeigned
marks of contrition. '
- It was in vain that he wifhed to derive an
advantage from the recent iigns of repentance
which he had exhibited the edid of the coun­
cil of (late, which we have mentioned in the
preceding chapter, could hot'be difpenfed with.
Thepainsofdeathexprefslyawarded there ought

whofe. hearts were warmed with the rays of that
beneficence and indulgence which Religion al­
ways inculcates, and with .which the confuttors of
the Holy Inquifition have ever been infpired.
It is alfo to be obferved, that the definitive *
judgment was referved for the confederation of
the great Pius VI. who in the courfe of his
glorious pontificate has ever united the charac­
ters of a juft and a clement prince. H e was not
anxious for the death of a finner; but, on the
contrary, wifhed that he ihould have time al­

Supreme Oracle, on theperfon of Jofeph Balfa-

dence, religion, and public tranquillity ; and is
equally calculated for the dominions of the

therefore give an exaft tranfeript of it.

Concerning the Lodge o f Free Mafons difcovered at
. Rome.
E have already obferved that the go»
vernment of Rome, while watching
the motions of Caglioftro, had difeovered a
lodge of free mafons inftituted in that capital:
the houfe in which thefe orgies were celebrated
is fituate in the quarter called the Holy Trin ity
o f the Mountain.
On the very night after the detention of
Caglioftro, the officers of juftice vifited this
lodge. But it was eafy to perceive that the
members had received intimation of their dc-
fign : for they had been attentive to their per-
fonal fecurity, and had carried away the em­
blems and inftruments of mafonry, as well as a
great part of the papers and the books relative
to their myfteries, which perhaps contained
fecrets of great importance.
Notwithftanding this, the few articles that
were fuffered to remain, more efpecially their
regifter, joined to the depofitions of a multitude

of well-informed peribns, gave us a thorough
infight into the origin, the eftabliihment, and
various other particulars concerning this lodge.
If we had followed the natural order of the
narrative, we lhould have recapitulated thefe
circumftances in Chap. II. where we have
given an abridgment of the hiftory of malbnry
in general: but it has been judged expedient
to mention thefe particulars here, that we
might not interrupt the account of the perfonal
exploits of Caglioftro. ’
, The founders of this lodge were feven in
number, five Frenchmen, an American, and a
Pole; all of whom were previoufly initiated in
Other lodges. ** Sighing at the horrid idea,”
as they fay in the book that contains the re­
cords of their 'proceedings, ** of living in
darknefs, and of being unable to make any
progrefs in true fcience, we have determined
to find out a facred artd enlightened fpot,
diftant from the profane e^e of mankind; to
whom it fhall remain eternally fecret and im­
penetrable, and in which union, harmony, and
peace, fhall for ever reign.’*
This' refyeStable inftitution, which afterwards
afiumed the title of the «
* Lodge of the Re­
union of True Friends,” was held in the houfe
already alluded to; in which the firit aflembly

took place on the ift of November 17 8 7 , and
continued afterwards once or twice a week:
iometimes howfever, but rarely, they held their
meetings in another houfe.
From the firft momentoftheir inftitution thef
begantomake profelytes; they admitted candi- ‘
dates who had not been received into any other
j fociety, and gave permiffion to the members of
other lodges to alllfl: in quality of viiitors.
Soon after this lodge alfo fent its viiitors to
other focieties; and thefe were provided with
certificates and fecret inftru&ions, which are
not explained in the regifter.
: Their numbers began to increafe with great
. rapidity, as they admitted young and old,
married men and bachelors, Italians, French,
Ruffians, Poles, Englifh, &c. who were al­
ready afTociated with other lodges; fuch as
thofe “ of the Perfect Equality of Liege
the Patriotic Society at Lyons;” ** the Se­
cret and Harmonious of M a l t a “ the Coun­
c il of the Eleft at Carcafiona«* the Concord
of Milan “ the Perfeft Union of Naples
and the other lodges at Warfaw, Paris, and
London, enumerated in their journals. The
vifitations of all thefq are entered and particu-
larifed in the regifter; but their names, fur-
names, and qualities, are confided to other

books appertaining to the lodge. Several par­
ticulars are however indicated by means of
myftefious and equivocal phrafesj which, with«
out doubt, ttrere looked upon to be of great
importance, as they did not choofe to hazard
the detail and explanation of them in any of
their proceedings.
, That this lodge might be eftablifhed with
all the neceflary formalities, they thought it
proper at its commencement to procure the
approbation of the mother lodge at Paris.
For this purpofe they requested and received
from that lodge the ftatutes, inftru&ions, and
regulations, for its exterior and interior go­
vernment and police, and alfo for the conduct
of its members. They fent weekly to the
mother lodge not only an exaft and authentic
lift: of the members, affociates, ranks, and
Official diftin&ions, .but alfo of the bulinefs
concluded and agreed upon in the courfe of
every feffion. They had a deputy, who redded-
at Paris as the reprefentative of the lodge; and
by means of him they carried on an uninter­
rupted correfpondence with the lodge or Orient
there. On thefe occafions they never made'
ufe of the poftfor tranfportingtheir letters,
butof fpecial* meffengers exprefslyprovided
for that purpofe. ,

. The mother, lodge alfofent them frequent
fpftru&ions for the regulation of the affairs o f
the fociety, and patents and certificates for
finch of the brotherhood as defired them. Every
fix months, with the moft myfterious formality
4nd the moft fcrupulous fecrecy, the mother
lodge iffued out to the fubordinate lodges »
match-word, which was communicated to all
the-members$ and by which they difcovered
each other, at any time, place, or iituation, to
be true free mafons.
Every year they were ordered to fend an
offering or prefent to the Orient at Paris, as a
contribution for maintaining the fplendour and1
dignity of the common centre of the mafonic
union. In November 1789 that lodge de­
manded an extraordinary gratuitous free-offering
from that at Rome; on account of which
all the brotherhood were taxe<
3 at a crown*
a-head : the fum fent amounted to eighty*
crowns. . 1
Befides the correfpondence with the mother
lodge, that of Rome carried on an intercourfe
with thofe of Lyons, Malta, London, Naples,
Meifina, Palermo, &c. Many memorandumsare
inferted in the regifter of letters received from
thofe lodges, and read by the venerable grand
matter, or the fecretary : mention is alfo made

Among other things, it had been propofed
to fend all the ftatutes of this fubordinate lodge
to that of Paris, fo that the regulations might
be printed; and it was alfo requefted that
permiffion might be given for the admiffion
of female members. But the fear of de-r
tedion precluded the firft fcheme; and as
to the fecond, it was fufpended on account
of the difficulties that the lodge would be
fubjeffc to by receiving candidates of ano*
ther lex. Mention is alfo made in the regifter
of the archives kept under three locks', in which
the ftatutes, the myfterios, and the fymbols,
tranfmitted from Paris to Rome are preferved;
and alfo all the moft interefting fpeeches pro*
nounced in the lodge either by the grand
mailer, or any of the members : among other?,
there is one mentioned under the name of
Romulus and Rem us. : .
There is nothing in the Roman lodge, either
in regard to the ranks, gradations, offices, or
ceremonies, in which they efientially differ’
from other inftitutions of a fimiiar kind. Like-
the reft of the lodges in all parts of the world,'
they had their different clafles’or degrees, tb*

which the members afpired in fucceffion; fuch
as apprentice, journeyman, mafter, matter
cleft, and, laftly, Scottiih matter. It appears,
however, that io this lodge they never con-»
ferred but the three firft degrees, and no per-»
ion was admitted who was not well known to
the members; and it was alfo neceffary that he
Ihould be approved by' means of two unani-.
mous ferutinies.
The apprentice before he became a journey-,
man, and the journeyman before he became a
matter, was obliged to undergo a probationary
trial of three months, and give the moft ex-,
plicit proofs of his attachment and zeal for
the order.
The members were fubjeft to a contribution
proportionate to the rank which they held j
and this contribution was larger or fmaller,
according to their tttuation in life. The fee
paid by an apprentice amounted to twenty,
twelve, or eight crowns; that of a journeyman
was feven, five, or three; and that of a matter
was eight, fix, or four crowns, The free ma-
ions of other lodges who wiffied to be affiliated
with this, paid after the rate of a matter, Be-

tfye alms entirely according to his own difcre-
tion,
. As to, the Secretary, it is his bufincfs to
jnfpect the patents and certificates, to regifter
the proceedings of each meeting, and tq read
and verify the bufinefs of the preceding one,
fo that its authenticity may be rendered unim­
peachable. .
The altercations, the difputes, and the of­
fences of the brotherhood are fettled and deter­
mined in the lodge. The ordinary penalties
are pecuniary fines, fufpenfions from office,
and fometimes degradation. He who betrays
the fecrets of the fociety is menaced with the
indignation of all the members, with perfec­
tion, and even with death. It does not how­
ever follow from this, that thefe threats have
ever been carried into execution. Some in-
itances of penance are inferted in the proceed­
ings ; but the faults or crimes for which they
yrere inflicted are not mentioned.
The Roman lodge was compofed of two
chambers, or halls, appertaining to the houfe.
The firft was called (t the Chamber of Reflec­
tions it was hung entirely with black. On
a table a death’s bead was placed; above which

the meaning of which was not generallyunder­
flood.
The fecond apartment was called “ The
• Templeand it was adorned in a different
manner, according to the rites that were to be
performed in it. However, it was on all oc-
cafions provided with a throne, on which the
Venerable conftantly fat; feveral emblems of
mafonry were fcattered up and down upon the
walls: among thefe were the fun, the moon,
and the ftars. On the two Tides of the throne
feveral magnificent pillars were placed; and
Oppofite to thefe the brotherhood Were ranged
in order, each of them wearing his lea­
thern apron •, about his neck alfo was a black
ribbon, in form of a deacon’s dolej and in
his hands, which were covered with a pair of
white gloves, he brandifhed a naked fword, a
hammer, or a compafs, according to the differ­
ent formalities prefcribed. by the inflitutions.
When the lodge was opened, they treated
about the economical regulations of the To-
ciety, difplayed the prefents which they had
received from other lodges, nominated or
accepted of a new brother. At moft of
thefe meetings they were accuftomed to re­

»11 thole who were not of their focietyj or an
apprentice wasadmitted to the rank of ajour»
neyman, or a journeyman to that of a mailer.
We fliall here recapitulate the ceremonies
made ufe of at the reception of an apprentice.
One of the brotherhood, whofe face was con»
cealed by means of a malk, received the candi*
date at the outer gate, and conduced him into
the Chamber o f Reflexions, which was lighted with
a folitary taperofyellowwax^The Terrible then
delired him to betakehimfelf tohis meditations
while heremained in that apartment; and foon
after prefented him with three queftions, to
Which hedemanded an anfwer in writing, '
Thefe queftions related to a man’s duty to
God, to fociety, and to himfelfj and each can­
didate anfwered them according to his judg­
ment during the Ihort period allowed by the
man in the malk for that purpofe. On his
return he carried the queftions, with the an* ‘
fwers annexed, to the temple, and prefented
them to the Venerable; and then making his
appearance once more, he ordered the candi­
date to lay afide his buckles, his watch, his
fword, his money, and every article of metal;
to kneel on his lefe knee, and to ftrip his
fhoulder and left arm.
In this fituation die candidate is conduced

the .temple with a bandage over his eye»*
.being ordered,to fall upon his knees before the
Venerable, after a variety of qjueftions concern»-
ing his n^me); his furname, his country, and
the reafons for wiihing to be received into the
fociety, he. is .conducted feveral times round
the temple ; and hears, during that, ceremony,
a terrible and alarming noife. Being then
once more brought before the throne of the
Venerable, and again delired to kneel, h?
fwears on the Evangelifts, or on the Jw o rd o f
honour, to preferve the moft inviolable fecrecy
in regard to whatever concerns th.e fociety, and
the moll implicit obedience to all its regular
pons. On this occafion one of the brethren
recites the form ula of the oath, and the mafoq
eledt;repeats it word by word ; promifing rathet;
to fuffer the moft excruciating torments, thaq
violate or betray any of the fecfets cotpmynjy
cated to him* ' . L
, The bandageis then taken from his eyes, and
he finds himfelfin the midft ofthebrotherhood,
whoareall cladin their white glovesand aprons,
each holding at t;he fame time a naked fword,
with the point turped towards him. Then the
Venerable, laying one hand on the head of the
candidate, and with the other finking the table
three-times with his hammer, declares him a

-Undjon apprentice; faying-at the’fame time,
* All thefe- fwords which you fee around you
fliall be employed in your defence if you prove
faithful to the lodge, andfhall be turned againft
you if you prove unfaithfuí.’,, '
'•The new apprentice, after this, embraces ali
thfc brothers, and receives an- apron, and the
other attributes ’of malonrythe Venerable,
or the Orator, then addfeffes- him in a fpeechf
inllruftive of his duties, and pnefents him with"
two pair of gloves, one for- himfelf, and ano- ■
thcr for his>
fweetheart; after which he is
taught theJig n s, the Jignals, and the w ords, by
which he can make himfelf known to thofe of*
his brethren "-of the fame rank' with him­
felf. At length the ceremony ends with a gene­
ral Ihout ofjoy ; andthe members adjourn to a
Cupper provided at the expence of and in ho­
nour of:the new brother.
The rank of journeyman is conferred in the-
fame manner, and almoft with the fame cere-*
monies. They renew their firft.oath, and learn
Other Jigns, Jignals, and w ords; by which they« '
know how to diftinguilhjourneymen free mafons. _
The third rank, which is that of mailer ma-
fon, requires formalities of a more ferious
nature. The candidate for that rank, enters*
the temple, without being blindfolded; but

he beholds every thing around Him clad ift
black, and the apartment lighted up with ft
jingle taper. After this, feveral myfterious and
fymbolical ceremonies take place; the matte*
cleft is. then condufted three times around the
temple by the Terrible, who holds the point
of a naked fword againft his bread, but with«
out wounding him j he afterwards defires hint
to meditate on what he fees fofpended front
the roof of the temple; on this the candidate
looking up, beholds three death's beads, and un­
der each of them human bones eroding ea^h
other, with memento m en, painted as a motto
beneath.
After having made three turns round the
apartment the candidate is condufted to a cof*
fin, when being dcfired to crofe his legs, he
is forced to lay down upon a matrafs placed in
the iniide, and being covered with a black
cloth, the brethren walk round him, andper­
form a variety of ceremonies. Being after­
wards taken up, he renews the accuftomed oath
' of fidelity and obedience, is taught the fig ia ,
ftgnals, and words, which diftinguiih his rank j
he goes round to all his brothers and embraces
them, and then places himfelf among the
matters.
Thefe are the ufual and ordinaryceremonies

made ufe of on the admiflion to the different
ranks and degrees of free mafonry; and with
a very little variation the fame take place at
this day in all the lodges of Europe. It hap*
pens however fometimes that .they vary and
jalter them according to the caprice, or the
inclination, of the grand mafter j thus it is well
known that in the Roman lodge, among the
queftions to a certain candidate before the
oath was tendered, the following interrogatory
was put: “ Are you difpofed to obey every
thing that lhall be commanded by the lodge,
even although it lhall be contrary to religion
and to the fovereign authority ?” On having
difcovered the mod lively indignation at this
propofftion, the Venerable added, “ that it was
nothing more than a fimple queftion, and thae
* they,neither talked* of religion nor of govern­
ment while the lodge was open.”
It is well known that, on receiving a can­
didate into the degree of apprentice in ano­
ther fociety, they obliged him to make his te£
tament, that he might be intimidated by the
fear of death j %
nd as he was an ignorant per­
fon, the Venerable endeavoured to add to
his fright by the repetition of the following fen-
tcnces:

In fine, a third perfon on a fimilar occafioti ,
was forced to make his confeffion to a perfon
who clothed himfelf for that exprefs purpofe
in the habit of one of the regular orders, and
during this ceremony he was placed in a kind
of confeffional “ in the chamber of refleftions.”
We cannot here recount with precifioh,-'
either the words or the figns by which the;
mafons diftinguiih each other; for, as we
have already faid, thefe vary according to the
different lodges, arid the different ranks of
the rdfpeftive members; and befides this*
they are all changed, and new ones ordained,
according to the inftrudtions received from
( time to time from the mother lodge.
•We can allure the reader however, that the
words are allegorical, and generally have a .
reference to,the mechanical part of mafonry,
and to the building of Solomon’s Temple, as

heck, and the bread, or in fqueezing the hand
or the finger of a brother.
Thus we have detailed all the particulars
concerning the lodge inftituted at Rome» If
we are not able to develope the whole of the
fecrets and myfteries made ufe of, andalio of
the principal object and defign of the members,
it mud be recollected that they were but tpo
well and faithfully informed of the fteps taken
by the Holy Office to bring them tojuftice*
It was owing to this, that they had time to
fecrete the moil important of their books and
papers, and that the principal members, who
Could alone have folved the enigma, were en­
abled to cfcape from the vigilance of the po­
lice } for the lodge being entirely modern, and
founded but a few years fince, it is extremely
probable that its fecrets were entrufted to only
a chofen few. It will however occur to every
perfon of common fenfe, who happens to read
•and to weigh the fads contained in this hiftory,
that folly, fuperftition and impiety are the dif-
tinguiihing charaCteriftics of thofe focieties at
prefent known in Europe by the name of
Free Mafons. .
Let us return thanks toHeaven for furnilhing
us with the means of rendering abortive the
firft attempt for introducing this folly and im­

of God hath promifed, notwithftanding the
fnares.of hell, that the faith for which our
Lord Jefus hath fpent his precious blood, fhali
always remain pure and unpolluted in the
church of St. Peter. The efficacious pro«
te&ion of the Holy Apoftles who have pro*
pagated, fuftained, and defended it at the ex­
pence of a glorious martyrdom j the zeal of a

der us fecure in regard to the future, againft

would furprife and fwallow us up alive.
