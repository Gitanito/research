in my misspent youth instead of doing
drugs and chasing skirts I was spending
eight hours a day meditating doing hey
danta when I was in my late teens and
early 20s and I had some experiences
that taught me that this was really easy
to do because I just said I want to
learn how to do this and I
notwithstanding the fact I was raised a
very devout atheist very the catechisms
of atheism did fit in a test-tube didn&#39;t
exist in the discussion but at the most
agnosticism but after my near-death
experience and when I was 17 I had an
experience of that state of mind it was
beautiful it was this supernal state and
they were forget it and I said well I
really want to learn how to arrive at
that state of deep peace and quiet and
oneness if you wouldn&#39;t want to call it
that it&#39;s a universal oneness without
having to die or you know or have it
something terrible happened to me which
is what happened and have a near-death
experience so I did so I learned
meditation and it was very comical
because I hurry I was on my 18th
birthday and I only tell this story not
in any self aggrandizing way but just to
give you a sort of a sense of how people
in train themselves to make things
difficult when they shouldn&#39;t so I
didn&#39;t know that it was supposed to be
so easy I didn&#39;t know that it was
supposed to be so hard so I accepted it
was natural and easy so my teacher did
the whole thing and they hated me and I
sat down and I immediately went into
this deep deep deep meditation and I
transcended into Samadhi and afterwards
he was looking at me sort of appalled he
says you transcended didn&#39;t you I said
you know what we were supposed to do
and I was I didn&#39;t know that I was
supposed to make it this big - Rui about
it you know and they you know make this
big deal and have to waste 30 years
doing something that you can do in 30
minutes so that&#39;s another lesson it you
know you need to sort of affirm to
yourself hey this can be done and B you
can do it if you think you can&#39;t do it
you won&#39;t but if you say of course I&#39;m
awake now why can&#39;t I close my eyes or
even with my eyes open eventually be
able to be in touch with the mind that
is this omnipresent field what our
owners are said the total number of
minds in the universe is one it&#39;s a
singularity so if you firm to yourself
you can do it you will be able to do it
if you sit there with the little gremlin
on your ego shoulder saying I can&#39;t do
it I won&#39;t do it I&#39;m not Ingo Swan I&#39;m
not that you know blah blah blah poor me
well you&#39;re not it&#39;s like you know a
doctor trying to put a chest tube in if
I if I have to put a chest tube in hair
pose he&#39;s just been run over by a Mack
truck and he&#39;s got a hemothorax and I&#39;m
going I can&#39;t do this I well I&#39;m not
going to do it I&#39;m gonna lacerate all
the nerves and is whatever before I get
into where I need to be so there&#39;s a
certain amount where you have to give
yourself a break and say I can do this
because I&#39;m awake and go back to some
experience in your life that&#39;s been
intuitive or some experience in your
life where you&#39;ve experienced a lucid
dream and then the next day it happened
and begin to recall these experiences
where you go I do have this aspect of
the mind within me that is on the
present and I can go to that place and
use it for good and to see things in
real time that are going on now at
distant places but also I can see things
into the future or if I need to into the
past
why because consciousness transcendence
not only linearity of space it
transcends the flow of time and that&#39;s
that that is solves the mystery of the
precognitive lucid dream
now the Charak I&#39;m a quarter Cherokee my
grandmother was Cherokee Indian and I in
their tradition
is a big tradition of lucid precognitive
dreaming like at the Hoopoe which I just
learned actually were the people who the
Anasazi who disappeared became the Hopi
and they would have these experience a
precognitive Li si in the future in the
dream state and envision quests and what
you find is that that&#39;s something you
can do also most of the very important
Close Encounters of the fifth kind where
we were going to set out to own an
expedition to a foreign country or
someplace a week before it would happen
sometimes more than one of the people I
was going to travel with would have a
dream of an event that would happen and
where the place look like even there was
a place we&#39;ve never been and it would be
crystal clear may just be a flash it may
just be an instantaneous flash it may be
in that hypnagogic state you know the
state in between waking and dreaming
that&#39;s a great time to practice this
once you learn the science of
consciousness which I&#39;m introducing you
to here very quickly so I went from
aircraft sightings to this stuff but
this is what&#39;s really exciting and at
that point you go wow I can be in that
relaxed state going in and out of
meditation but also in and out of sleep
and see a distant place but also perhaps
see a point in the future
caveat anything that&#39;s in the future can
only be a probable future if it&#39;s in the
past it&#39;s kind of in Crystal it it&#39;s
there so in the Akashic record it&#39;s
there if it&#39;s in the future it&#39;s subject
to change depending on what everyone
including yourself thinks and does and
this is why when people say on December
blahblah of this year X Y &amp; Z is going
to happen I immediately know they&#39;re
charlatans because if they get that
fixed in their predictions about sue
saying into the future they don&#39;t
understand the nature of reality and
that it&#39;s this organic evolving
phenomenon that is subject to the
thoughts and the actions of even those
who have heard your prediction
including yourself you know we sort of
like the Heisenberg on that&#39;s our a bit
it&#39;s sort of a psychic Heisenberg
principle but so that is something you
have to understand that it may be 95
percent likely 80% likely 99.9 percent
likely but not a hundred percent if it&#39;s
off the nail
now if it&#39;s in now in real time and you
become accurate boom it&#39;s there now be
here now or if it&#39;s in the past
but when we&#39;re doing ce-5 contact work
normally we do preparation before we go
out so I encourage people to practice
this pre cognitive capability before we
go out that night for example and I
encourage people on their teams to do it
and then but when you&#39;re there in real
time you&#39;re observing with your
conscious mind and inviting these
civilizations to come visit in real time
if they can and if it&#39;s safe and
everything if it&#39;s an appropriate group
and we always do this within the context
of not dolphins at SeaWorld jumping
through hoops for us and entertaining us
we do it within the context of genuinely
wanting to be ambassadors or emissaries
from earth and humanity to these
civilizations without prejudice so it&#39;s
sort of a global diplomatic core of
interstellar travelers that&#39;s what we&#39;re
developing who understand to get out of
this sort of the the orthodoxy and
catechisms of conventional UF ology 99%
of which is rubbish and to step into
being in a higher state of consciousness
making contact with these civilizations
without fear and without prejudice about
who they are and where they&#39;ve come from
or even perhaps what they&#39;ve done in the
past because the past cannot let&#39;s look
at it this way no matter how you views
these civilizations the future is always
different from the past and we create
the future now just remember that very
important I mean a generation ago they
were dropping atomic bombs on Japan and
blowing up every city in Germany now
they&#39;re our closest allies so humans
need to learn to get out of
the us-versus-them xenophobia this sort
of the negative end of atavistic
proclivities returning to this sort of
primitive monkey troupe fighting
murderous rampaging monkey routine
because we can&#39;t afford that
not with nuclear weapons and not with
weapons that have been developed from
studying extraterrestrial technologies
which are a million times more powerful
than a hydrogen bomb which we have
already scalar electromagnetic weapons
so that that means that there need to be
a core of us who are willing to put
ourselves out there to be sincerely with
a pure heart and without fear of
prejudice ambassadors to these
civilizations because they are out there
and you know what they&#39;re waiting
you
