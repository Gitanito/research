  Text:   Narrative from NDE describing encounters with people not previously known

    This page contains 5 near-death experiences (NDEs) describing encounters with deceased people not previously known. This is a small sampling, and not intended to be a comprehensive listing of such NDEs posted on NDERF.

      Methodology: 

      Experiences were scored as near-death experiences (NDEs) if they met all of the following:

  1.  A lucid, organized experience occurring at the time of a life-threatening event so severe that there is unconsciousness or clinically apparent death with an absent heartbeat.

  2.  An NDE Scale score of 7 or higher.

  3.  Shared by the individual who personally had the NDE.

  4.  Shared in English via the completed survey form on nderf.org.

  These are NDEs from the most recent version of the NDERF survey (nderf.org). They are sequentially shared NDEs from November 11, 2011 to April 8, 2021. All accounts were scored as NDEs if they met the above criteria and regardless of experience content to avoid bias in studying the content of the NDEs.

    The NDEs posted on the NDERF website are edited to correct obvious spelling and grammar errors. As remarkable as the NDEs are in this list, please remember that they accurately represent the real experiences of near-death experiencers (NDErs) from all walks of life and around the world.  

  We strive to make a larger collection of NDEs that include verified encounters with deceased people not previously known available to the world with as compressive a collection of such NDEs as possible. We would be delighted to collaborate in this endeavor with anyone with other credible internet sources of NDEs describing encounters with deceased people not previously known.

      This list is public domain and may be used by anyone.

  Substantial efforts are made to minimize the risk of posting fraudulent NDE accounts on nderf.org: See a more detailed explanation. 

  We strive for accuracy in this list. If any NDEs should not be included for any reason, please email us at nderf@nderf.org with the NDE registry number and URL. Thanks!

    This brief list illustrates that NDEs can include encounters with deceased people not previously known to the NDErs. Even a brief review of the NDEs below should demonstrate that these types of NDEs can and do occur.
