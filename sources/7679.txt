  		              		Experience Description   

    I just learned about a problem with my pregnacy this morning. I have only shared this with my mom and daughter. I was in the operating room for a C-section to have my daughter.     I remember floating in the air. I could not breathe. I panicked because I couldn't understand how I could be alive while not breathing.  As I was rotating and moving upwards, I noticed my sight was amazing.  I could very clearly see through walls.  I saw where my body was and watched the doctors trying to resuscitate me. I realized I could not speak, so I spoke with my thoughts, 'God, I cannot die before I see my baby.'   

  Immediately, I felt myself back in my body. Because of the anesthesia, I could not see or move.  Yet I needed to reach the male doctor on my left who I had seen during my experience. He held my hands, saying to me, 'I am here and will not leave you alone.' Everyone in the room was celebrating saying, 'She’s back! She’s back!' I was very fearful, so for the next four or five days I had a nurse by my side. I was only 24 years old when I had my daughter. I was married When I was 23 years old.  

  Years later, I conceived and developed a lot of complications, so I was put on bed rest. After two months, one morning I begun to shake and could not move. I was paralyzed from about 0730AM. My stomach was really shaking.  Initially, the doctor had said that my hormone levels were very high.  At 1000AM in the morning, I was awake on my bed.  Then right in front of me, an oval-shaped, extremely brightly lit door opened. A transparent person with the appearance of the same very bright light came out. He was made of light. He put his hand inside me as I watched.  I felt a very calm sensation as he removed my baby.  He got back through the door and the light entrance closed. It took me 30 minutes to move, as my stomach continued shaking. I called my husband and in the evening he took me back to the gynecologist.  I did mention my experience to my husband but he thought I was crazy.  I kept telling him when we go for a scan there will be no baby.  Later at four months, a scan was done and no child was there. They called it a 'blighted ovum.' No matter the explanation, I never spoke about it again.  

  After that, I devoted myself to trying to understand spirituality. I have many experiences I cannot share with anyone especially since it concerns information of the future. I don’t speak of them unless family and mom needs to know.  

  I feel relieved for speaking out this day. Thank you for your website that has made me realize, I am not alone.
