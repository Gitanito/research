now what i would like
to begin to share with you is
a series of things on this
uh issue that sort of presents
how how are they gonna do it
now one of the things that we&#39;ll start
showing
if you wanna for a moment if you can
provide
you know this is the authorization for
the study
that&#39;s due in june and then i want to
show you a series of things so let&#39;s
look at this for a moment
this is a very interesting case
cash land room you probably have all
heard of it
this was actually a
extraterrestrial vehicle that was being
test flown by four
humans out of the nevada test range
and this we have from an air force
intelligence guy who is the principal
investigator you&#39;ll see his clip later
talking about the fact that he debriefed
the pilots of this
and what happened as you know the people
underneath
this object when it was out of control
were
irradiated and were extremely and very
sick had to be hospitalized
one of the famous cases in 1980
now what happened is that when
this occurred they couldn&#39;t get the
extraterrestrial energy
power plant to work so they put on
foolishly a nuclear portable nuclear
power plant on this thing
and they were test flying it out of the
nevada test range area 51.
by the way nobody calls it that but
people don&#39;t know what&#39;s out there
and it was being flown to a base
in texas it went out of control outside
houston huffman texas i believe it was
and it came down and irradiated and
actually irradiated the land there and
actually that whole road had to be
repaved clandestinely now
the public was left to believe this was
you know the aliens came down and
poisoned everybody or they
they didn&#39;t say they were happy for
people to reach and leap to these
conclusions
in reality this we have now proof and
testimony from the principal
investigator for the air force
who debriefed the four pilots on this
humans
and that object my friend was
test flown by humans but it was
extraterrestrial so this is a hybrid
case where you have an extraterrestrial
airform
and systems but the power energy system
they couldn&#39;t quite get to work
they put this nuclear power plant on it
it had a
filter or some some problem with
malfunction sort of spewing this stuff
uh out to these poor victims who have
never been compensated in fact
the case went to court the judge threw
it out because the government said we
don&#39;t know what this is we had nothing
to do with it
but the truth is they weren&#39;t lying the
government the government
people thought about the government
which government who in the government
the nature of an unacknowledged special
access project like this
is that if the secretary of defense
doesn&#39;t know about it and the director
of the cia hasn&#39;t read into it and
they&#39;re lying to the president about it
do you think the public information
officer or the case officer for an air
force base near houston is going to know
what the hell this was
no so they&#39;re not lying this is
plausible deniability
because since they don&#39;t know they can
testify under oath this wasn&#39;t ours we
know nothing about this
now we know for a fact and we have the
recorded video testimony
of the air force office special
investigations uh principal investigator
on this
richard dodie who is a master of
disinformation in his career but is
coming
clean on some of this
next
we&#39;re going to go through a series of oh
well maybe not
okay i thought this was going to be a
slide one after another um
so next what we&#39;re going to see are a
series of schematics and cases
of over the years uh very interesting
this is 1956 sort of a domed object with
these
underneath this was a man-made
anti-gravity vehicle uh from the 50s
that was seen and we can go to the
drawing of it very good excellent
illustrations
uh and you know a very well documented
case
i&#39;m going to go through a number of
these examples next
this is one from new zealand our friends
from down under
this is also a man-made object
the date on this uh it&#39;s listed
somewhere below there
um i believe it was in the 50s and
that object a very well documented case
occurred
and someone came out and was is a human
in sort of an astronaut suit
but this i believe it&#39;s 1959. um
here we are yeah blenheim new zealand
it had these flames so it had a
combination of uh
anti-gravity and also other types of
energy systems and people say oh this is
from new zealand i said oh yeah 1959.
next we&#39;re going to run through a bunch
of these quickly
okay next this is a really interesting
one uh
again the dates this was 1966.
i love the mustang and there&#39;s an object
that came in
and uh for some reason landed
malfunctioned
another early prototype of a man-made
uh electrogravity meaning anti-gravity a
high-voltage
system and it rose up uh
and took off like a spark off a grinder
as i was described
but you can see there are some
components of it from conventional
aerospace aircrafts on the front the
bubble
but this was again it sort of said a
high drilling whining sound as it took
off and was gone
this is man-made 1966
next and this is very similar to some of
the tic-tac things uh
it&#39;s a got an arc on it uh i think this
was
in what date was this this is a
20 uh well no not 2017.
that&#39;s a
sure of the date anyway uh but a very
interesting
object reminiscent of of some of the tic
tac and other objects
we have a number of videos of these
canister and cylinder objects
this was seen in enough detail you can
see the rivets you can see
the detail an extraterrestrial vehicle
is seamless
has no parts like that has no welds
those when you see those my friends
those are not extraterrestrial
those are man-made and there are a
series of generations of these that have
been rolled out
um since the 50s operationally
they were studied before that next
this is a really interesting one um
again this 1972 so we&#39;re talking almost
50 years ago
it looks like an iron with this
rectangular object on it
that was seen and multiple witnesses
again this is a man-made uh
platform a silent electrophoretic
next
and this is a really interesting one
this is from the also the 72
uh it has the sort of flaming uh
energy out of the rear of it and a
bubble
uh another one in front that&#39;s man-made
i don&#39;t forget which city this was over
um
yeah venus way though people say really
these
other countries oh yes all over the
world
i mean these operations are not just out
of remote places like area 51.
so they have these facilities all over
the world you know alice springs here
and there
uh and although and and they can go
anywhere very quickly
because they&#39;re not using jets and
rockets because even our most you know
really extraordinary craft may get
anywhere in the world in a couple hours
these don&#39;t take that long so those have
been experimented with in different
shapes forms and sizes
many of them are based on re acquired
extraterrestrial vehicles that we have
shot down and studied and then
experimented with the
airframe and the propulsion and energy
systems
the flaming ellipse next
this is an interesting one this is from
1980s i&#39;m just taking you in
chronological order
number one uh there are a lot of objects
that are sort of rectangular or domed
rectangles
totally silent can float over the
landscape
many of the objects we&#39;ll get to in a
moment and seeing the hudson valley back
in the 80s 90s uh were those kinds of
objects these are again
electromagnetographics these are
pop culture anti-gravity and different
versions of them different airframes
different experimental types and many of
them have been deliberately flown over
populated areas
to prompt a ufo sighting but make people
think that they are the extra truster
once so you have two
things going on simultaneously actual
extraterrestrial vehicles
and the ones that are made by
clandestine
aerospace and the black budget funding
and the unacknowledged special access
projects the deep black world
of engineering next
i mean all these cases each look we have
hundreds and hundreds this would go on
for days if we were going but these are
very interesting
excellent drawings now this case of
course i was very involved with
um as you know this is a japan airlines
case
of uh 747 going over alaska
and we can go up and the pilot had this
massive
vehicle come forward this is a real one
let&#39;s look at it you scroll look
no
there&#39;s a wonderful schematic of what
the pilot saw
it was a large seamless almost like
walnut shaped object
massive um that was i guess that make it
into the
slide sorry that was uh the japan
airlines case that&#39;s one of the
disclosure witnesses
as you know was uh mr callahan
and he was the chief faa uh person in
charge of accidents and incidents
when this occurred during the reagan
years and
he actually has handed to us and i have
the original
radar films chick tracings not a copy
the originals
we have and the japan airlines pilot
encountered this object and it would be
you know this part of the sky at one
second
and a couple sweeps of the radar or one
sweep would be in another direction
altogether
and the pilot the japanese pilot said
described it it was actually on military
radar
on board visually seeing and civilian
radar
so this got kicked up to the highest
level of the faa
and at that meeting if you remember the
disclosure project
the cia came in and said we&#39;re going to
confiscate all of the data on this
and they had just stacks and stacks of
digital data on this case
and so they had to give it up and mr
callahan says
yeah okay we&#39;ll give it to you turns out
those were copies he kept the originals
and we left the aafaa he took them
and we have one true okay
so next this is a very interesting a
pyramid-shaped object
uh a model similar to it here
um now this has all kinds of tubes
and structures on the bottom and uh
what&#39;s interesting that this is 1994.
there are extraterrestrial vehicles uh
that are parametric but there are also
man-made ones that they&#39;ve made to look
like them so they&#39;re copycat
you see what they&#39;re doing so it&#39;s like
the old commercial
is it real or is it memorex so is this
the only way i&#39;m mic&#39;d
so we probably need to have people
handing me these these models if i can
have an assistant there
and then hand off here there you go
thank you
so here is
thank you um this is another this is a
great one i like
this one because we may have this is
also in england 1990
and this one is great because it has if
you look at the underside
there are the girders and the structures
and they&#39;re even weld marks
now of course there&#39;s the triangular and
the people under it could see
that and could see the light in the
center and the three on the in
that is manmade that is an anti-grav
object and we have many people who are
have been in the aerospace
classified projects who have described
these and
how they operate and so we have massive
files on these sort of
different kinds of triangles now
just to make things more complex because
the world is complex
there are extraterrestrial vehicles that
are triangular
and are saucer shaped and there are
other weird shapes
so to make things complicated here
you how are you going to know well
you got to be close enough to it to see
and if you
can&#39;t see the the superstructure
detail you&#39;re not going to know whether
it&#39;s extraterrestrial or not
but i&#39;ll give you these few hints the et
ones are not manufactured by digging
stuff up
and soldering things together and what
have you that&#39;s not how they manufacture
they are doing it through a frequency
sonic
resonance manufacturing that pulls from
a template
an object in its entirety as a piece
from the elementals let&#39;s call it of
space-time
the foundation of energy of space-time
and it comes into 3d like 3d printing
but for a whole spacecraft but not
putting plastic molding injectors in
but it being brought from the finest
foundation of energy not only the zero
point
but beyond that even trans-dimensionally
so this is trans-dimensional
manufacturing we don&#39;t have time to go
into this we&#39;ll go into it more this
week
for for everyone
and then this one again this is a very
interesting one
this is the very famous uh phoenix
lights one
who was here for that anybody i was
so there were a couple events that
happened then and i
we we have had both e.t
vehicles then piggybacked on
man-made events this is really confusing
because once there&#39;s something that
really happens
demonstrably that is a sighting
or an event they will then put
in up objects and and have things occur
that are the man-made ones to confuse
people
and they&#39;ll even do other decoils so
drop flares all kinds of things
so when i was here
in march of 1997 i flew in
on an airline and
as i was doing final approach into the
sky harbor airport
i did the ce5 protocols and asked the
et&#39;s to do something that would be very
definitive
that night or while i was there because
we were at a digital lab
that was run by an intelligence group
and we were getting the best photos and
videos that we could for the whole
planet for the congressional briefings
in april of 1997.
that&#39;s why i was here and then a few
hours later
this whole event happened phoenix lights
and there were a lot of things that were
coming out of the south mountains
last november we were here for the close
encounters of the fifth time premiere
we did a hike up there and came down at
sunset and an object dropped
materialized right over someone
who saw a couple of people who were my
friends here were there with me and saw
so
you have both phenomena happening
and this is the problem people are going
to say
it&#39;s all man-made it&#39;s all
extraterrestrial no and we need to get
another layer of understanding here
and particularly any important thing
that happens
by definition is going to be
inundated with a cover story and where
they&#39;re going to deceive people from the
real
over to the stage the ddt
let&#39;s call it so these these are more of
the triangular
this is a great one this is 1989 in
belgium
that you can see all the tubes and
structures underneath the belgian
cases so this what this particular one
was uh very much a man-made one
again this is global don&#39;t think you
have to think this
transnational group that runs these
unacknowledged special access projects
clandestine organization is global they
don&#39;t think of international they&#39;re
transnational and have been at least
since the 60s
and so here&#39;s another one very
interesting um
again this is from missouri a little
different from the uh
the ones that you can see the the
girders and the welds
on the side i hope you can see that
that&#39;s the camera and the people in the
webinar
and and these these are also well-known
platforms you can basically once you get
your
lifter system in place that causes mass
cancellation
you can create any kind of air structure
around it
and it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s
aerodynamic or not because the way it
moves
it moves let&#39;s say the molecules of air
around it so it&#39;s basically moving in
electromagnetic
field effect so there&#39;s no resistance
and there is no
sonic boom that&#39;s man-made we&#39;ve had it
for decades
it&#39;s just too much i&#39;m just trying to
run through these this is to give you
just a sense
of all the different types and
structures that we know have been
man-made objects various different some
of them are
kind of hybrids they&#39;ll have some
conventional propulsion as well as
electrophoretic
different shapes and they all have
structural superstructure components
that are clearly
a man-made machine not an interstellar
vehicle and this is one of my favorite
i love this one because this one is
um this is from southern illinois in
2000 and not that long ago
um and it&#39;s just like a ranch house with
the pen
but it&#39;s like uh how midwestern um
and it&#39;s it&#39;s this object we&#39;re totally
non-aerodynamic silent floating
some you&#39;ll hear a transformer buzzing
sound often from these
and a similar rectangular ones were
some years ago in i think it was in the
1990s
were in the amazon
it was near where there was a
e-systems facility and these were put up
and engaged in
um they went from animal mutilations
being staged by clandestine human
organizations
to these were doing human vivisections
and killing humans but of course they
wanted everyone to believe
the aliens were doing vivisections on
people
no it wasn&#39;t it was our
sociopaths in this organization
so and here&#39;s another this is a great
one
uh this is uh from 1983
hudson valley very famous cases many
many witnesses to these
uh transformer sounding objects and
underneath when they&#39;re close
you can see superstructure and tubes and
other things
that is not extraterrestrial now have
there been extraterrestrial vehicles of
boomerang and other shapes yes
but what do you think they get the idea
and also how else you create
a false flag you have to create
structures
that would be believably not aerodynamic
so and this is another one this is
another boomerang shape uh
from the hudson valley uh there&#39;s a many
several years of these occurring you&#39;ve
all heard these cases
and you see underneath the
superstructure and the and the aspects
of it
and you know these are are
it looks a little bit like the b2
stealth but
this is different again they were silent
unless you were close enough you might
hear this sort of
electronic transformer sort of sound
right and another one
so i just want to run through these
they&#39;re all fun um
and i want to thank the people who
worked hard to create these from
the reports and the photographs that
exist this one
actually you could see up in it people
looked in and they could see
other structures and platforms inside
under the center of this particular not
an equilateral triangle
but isosceles is all right yep
so those are the reason i wanted to show
you that
is sort of to give you a sense of the
variety the type of crap
i don&#39;t know if we had any other
pictures i think maybe some of them got
dropped but
but it&#39;s enough to give you a sense of
what we have
now the archive on this is very large
and
i want to pay homage to mark mccandlish
who did the drawings if we want to bring
up mark mccallish&#39;s
work and the schematics now this is
based on
uh a very interesting event
that happened at the norton air force
base which has now been decommissioned
in southern california
and there are a number of people you
know a lot of people talk about well you
know
brad sorensen and some other people are
there there&#39;s a man on my team who
was is very close friends with frank
carlucci secretary of defense at the
time
that he calls him uncle frank who was
there
senator cranston was there because they
were read into these
unacknowledged projects and this was
a kind of like an air show and it was
sort of a sales pitch going on
and you see these three objects uh
there was the smaller one a medium one
and a big one you know baby bear mama
bear and papa bear
as one guy who was there called it and
these were from around the components in
them
were apparently from the between 1950
late 50s early 60s but these particular
models had obviously been used
quite a bit and had gone in the solar
system various places in our solar
system not the whole universe
but our solar system back then long
before we landed on the moon
now what&#39;s interesting is that one of
the people who was there did an
interview and and shared some of the
information and i&#39;m loathe
to read to people but this is just so
compelling i just want to share this
i&#39;m not going to say who this was or how
i got this recording transcript
but it&#39;s very interesting and he says
the small one
was 20 feet the next was 60 in diameter
and the next one maybe 120 feet uh it
looked like it was
the small one looked like personal light
speed vehicle it just boggles
my mind to think about it and he said
that
this one these objects didn&#39;t require
its own fuel source
and they had found a new fuel source
that was everywhere in the universe
it was a wavelength frequency
that was on the order of 500 times
the speed of light very important it&#39;s
invisible we can&#39;t feel it
they said that everything in the
universe is a vibration
light is just a resisted vibration
of this other force it is
is really fast vibrations or frequencies
if you start with this force that&#39;s 500
times the speed of light
and you resist it down you get gravity
resist down more and you get magnetism
and resist it down more you get light
resist down and you get sound heat etc
and down to things we really recognize
einstein and others could only sense
light
so thought that&#39;s the fastest thing in
the universe
that&#39;s all we can clock and they were
dead wrong that light is the fastest
thing in the universe
if you wanted to go to the moon say
you&#39;d point the upper video camera that
was on
these objects and point it to where we
wanted to go
and then you point put the crosshairs on
it
then you&#39;d move the rheostat a lever on
the inside
of the seat to add power or and allow
that power to be available
and it would go and it goes on and on
now why is this important because this
was at an air show
in 1988 and there&#39;s more than one
witness to this
by the way and we can put up mark
mcanlis a schematic of the interior that
was based on the description
and uh i want to honor mark mcconnell
she just recently the last couple weeks
passed away
but he was at the original national
press club event and he was just a
really
smart courageous talented aerospace
illustrator who
learned of this uh and you can see some
of the detail and where the compartment
would be for the people
um according to some people who are
there some of this isn&#39;t exactly
accurate but it&#39;s
pretty close rendition and it&#39;s a very
important
piece of history because that was the
transition
between reagan administration and
george h.w bush papa bush
and it was in november of 1988
and they were trying to get more funding
for
star wars sdi what&#39;s now called space
force and classified aerospace
contracting for these unacknowledged
special access project systems
the reason this is all critically
important for you to understand
is that the people who are running these
projects
want you to think as i said earlier
that nobody in the united states
has any knowledge of these objects that
they are now
euphemistically calling uaps
which is ludicrous the term on the face
of it
i don&#39;t use it except in a ridiculing
way because it&#39;s just absolutely not
that
but ultimately if you don&#39;t take my word
for this and all the data and all the
witnesses
when we listen to a guy named ben rich
head of the lockheed skunk works and ben
rich
had a friend that wrote to him john
andrews and he said uh the topic is ufos
i believe there are lots of ufos and i&#39;m
also team to believe that there are two
categories
man-made ufos and extraterrestrial ufos
and ben riches yes believer in both
categories and i feel everything is
possible
many of our man-made ufos are unfunded
opportunities so there&#39;s funny
underlining
unfunded opportunities there are
opportunities that could
have been used for a lot of great
purposes so this is dated 1986
and you know ben rich was the head of
the lockheed skunk works was a very
renowned aerospace figure
and you think well people who want i
think first of all this is
this is a document and all this is stuff
gonna need to go right to the senate
intelligence committee
we&#39;re planning to do a closed briefing
for them ahead of the director of
national intelligence
so if the director of national
intelligence dumps a bunch of falsehoods
onto the senate intelligence committee
they&#39;re going to have received all of
this and more that you&#39;re seeing we
don&#39;t have time to go through all of it
prior to this is why this is very
important but i&#39;d like to invite
a wonderful gentleman up mr goodall he&#39;s
a renowned
aerospace illustrator and researcher if
you would come up he has a couple just
little he&#39;s a
sort of surprise guest here today and i
would welcome you to share your story
that last conversation probably anyone
had with ben
rich and also your little quick story
you had with the
lady who had worked for the national
security agency
i was i&#39;m i&#39;ve been an aviation writer
and uh
aerospace historian hey most my adult
life
i&#39;m 76 that goes for a long time but i
had
somewhere along the line and was
probably through john andrews from
testers
that i became a pen pal if you want to
call it that with ben rich
he was kelly johnson&#39;s right hand man
and when
kelly johnson retired the only person
that could really fill his shoes
was ben and for 25 years
ben and i spoke he either called me or i
called him
once a quarter for 25 years i could call
him
at skunk works june his secretary would
say just second i&#39;ll kind of
put you into mr rich he&#39;d be in a
conference with a room full of engineers
he put me on speakerphone
and we talked for 40 minutes 45 minutes
but uh he was dying of esophageal cancer
this is the mid-90s
he&#39;d already retired from lockheed and i
tracked him down he was at usc medical
center
near the end of his his life and we were
talking about john andrews and some
other stuff and we started talking about
ufos
and he said jim we have things out in
the desert and he wasn&#39;t referring to
area 51
but said we have things out in the
desert that&#39;s 50 years
beyond what you and he was you know
talking directly to me
beyond what you can&#39;t imagine
he said if you&#39;ve and if you&#39;ve seen
movies like star trek or star wars
we&#39;ve been there done that or decided it
wasn&#39;t worth the effort
i said ben you want to expand upon that
and typical ben response was
no and he had the nerve to die on me
about 10 days later
the other thing uh late last year i
think 2019 maybe it was 20 20 and
the last two years have been sort of a
blur um
on scent i&#39;m not sure if it was cnn but
uh
tucker carlson on fox announced that the
federal government
had made made a statement that we have
uh
equipment that is not of this earth
there was also a government
employed that said the same thing so i
have a friend of mine who works for the
national security agency
i knew her from hawaii and she was in
pine gap
which is alice springs which is the
middle of nowhere if you&#39;ve ever been to
australia
and i sent her an email i said you
believe in ufos and i mean
instantly i got a response back i said
no why did you see one
and i said no and then she came back
so i can&#39;t i can&#39;t go over it on you
know through
electronic means maybe one of these days
we can sit down face to
face they said but they&#39;re here
and that was your comment now she was
she went from
time gap to guantanamo bay and now she&#39;s
back in hawaii and i hope to get to
hawaii sometime this year and sit down
with her face to face
thought my piece thank you very much my
pleasure very important little
pieces of of history um
now the the next thing i want to share
because i know i mean we have so much
today
um is something that
i want to set the stage before we put it
up on screen
a few months ago a woman who is the
granddaughter
of a seamstress
who was at the atomic bomb side who
actually
uh was the seamstress that made the
cover for the first atomic bomb so it
could be moved out and put on the
aircraft and then dropped on nakasaki
and hiroshima
and this particular
woman said look my grandmother lived to
be 90 some
she had been at the atomic bomb site
and it was moved to roswell and she was
there
when the roz the crash happened near
roswell in 1947
and all she would ever say is that
she absolutely knows that the et&#39;s are
real that&#39;s all she would say
so you know the family never knew
anything else
her this woman&#39;s grandmother passed away
and a few years later they were going
through
the attic and picked up a book
and out falls a 5
by 10 uh photograph
and it&#39;s a photograph of some kind of
humanoid
being that
we do not know from whence it came
and she was convinced it had to be one
of the
bodies from the roswell event
and we started looking at it and of
course being a doctor
i was looking at i wasn&#39;t a doctor in
1947
but it didn&#39;t look quite right i thought
it looked more european
um and then i enlisted the help of a
number of people to research this
and uh pat pearsall here helped find
a dr burns uh who is the work most
renowned medical archivist in the world
um in new york and he looked at it he
says no
the medical garb the setup all of it is
in an
autopsy it&#39;s he wanted to be very
scientific it&#39;s a dissection
of something from the 1920s
between 1922-1929
then we had a member of our team who has
very good connections with the
metropolitan museum of art
they have a whole division on clothing
and eras and all that
they looked at they said absolutely this
is mid-1920s
so we&#39;re talking 20 to 25 years before
roswell
and what are we looking at here
unfortunately i&#39;m not wired i thought i
would be but i can&#39;t walk over to it but
you have
if you want to zoom in on that on the
head and the body
uh oh dear oh boy
that&#39;s why i never touch a computer um
oh wait left well he&#39;ll come back
see i don&#39;t understand all this give me
a big
thing like this but while he&#39;s bringing
it back up
i will speak from this one so you have
what look like you know
military or intelligent civilians here
here and here you have medical personnel
this is the main
doctor doing the dissection this blob
here is just damage on the emotion
we had the paper tested the original
paper because we
had access to it and the original paper
is from
pre early 50s we know that
we also know that it&#39;s a photo of a
photo
okay and i&#39;m just telling you what we
know i&#39;m giving you the facts first and
i&#39;m going to give you an
educated assessment after
and it&#39;s a very unusual head and eyes
you can&#39;t see great detail but you can
see
some it&#39;s got a towel over it obviously
had probably
a lot of facial and neurotrauma you can
see
the body cavity and the ribs very
unusual
and in how it&#39;s structured almost like
an external these bumps on the outside
certainly not
a normal human and of
the hands and the feet
and the legs so we&#39;re dealing with
something
you know that isn&#39;t a a homo sapien a
human
we don&#39;t know what it is i&#39;m not calling
it an extraterrestrial at this point
because we need more
information which is why i was given
permission to disclose it to you today
and if it is what we think it is
it is in point of fact one of the most
important things ever to surface
because it predates roswell by
two decades or more and it is also
clearly some kind of formal operation
going on dissecting this and i have been
told by a number of my contacts in the
intelligence community who have been in
the vault as they call it
that there are files classified still
top secret
on this issue from the late 1800s and
early 1900s
they never went through them but they
know that they were related to
extraterrestrial intelligence and ufos
going that far back this is now 100
years ago
so i will pass this around you&#39;re free
to look at it
um those that you at home you can you
know zoom in and out as i
i now talk about my assessment so
i believe what happened because i&#39;ve
been involved in a number of cases as a
medical doctor an emergency doctor in
forensic cases
that when the roswell event happened
and this woman was heaven as her name
was there at roswell and been at the
atomic bomb
project she was cleared a very high
level of secrecy even though she was
doing
a rather ordinary task at the seamstress
but when roswell happened
if there was actionable intelligence and
files in an archive on prior
re retrievals or events
those would have been creatored in so
they would have had a comparative
anatomy
and a comparative point of reference
in studying the retrieval of the objects
from
the roswell crash what i think happened
now this we don&#39;t know
we&#39;re asking for the public to help is
that
they needed these older files and
someone she knew who is probably in the
photo lab at the
walker field said wow look at this
and he took a picture of the picture and
gave it to her
but she secreted it away until she died
it fell out of a book
now that those are the facts that are
known facts
it came from someone at roswell but it&#39;s
not roswell
it came from someone clear to the level
of the atomic bomb project
the mahant project and to be at roswell
which at the time
the 509th bomber squadron was the only
place in the world that had
atomic bombs in 1947
and and yet it isn&#39;t that era
but that&#39;s even more explosive it means
these covert programs that have studied
this issue
go back much further now
what we&#39;re asking for specifically for
the public
look at these men you
people out there may have family
pictures
who will know who one of these people
are if we
can identify one of them then we can
connect it further and begin to go
deeper into
what this really means or
if you&#39;re in a classified project and
have access to the vault
and you know who you are contact me if
you have any
detailed information on this i am
telling you everything we know
most of what we should know about this
case we have no idea
this was a serendipitous strange thing
that happened
where these people who we know the
provenance of the photograph we&#39;ve
tested it
we know it&#39;s from the 20s we know that
the the
woman in whose belongings it was found
who had deceased
was in fact at roswell we could prove it
and that she had been on the atomic bomb
project
more than that we don&#39;t know i&#39;m giving
you an informed
assessment of probably what this is but
we need the public this is where we can
crowdsource
digging into this and maybe someone has
an answer that&#39;s very
ordinary i doubt it not that
particular being so anyway
that is something i i think is a really
important case
it&#39;s in development um we&#39;ve hit a wall
the family
and my team we can&#39;t go any further
without someone
being able to tell us who any one of
those people might be and you have a
family
album from your great great grandfather
whoever from the 20s who would have been
an adult then
because all those men are dead by now
obviously
um who might know who they are and from
there we might be able to connect them
to an operation
an agency a military branch what have
you
so that&#39;s what we&#39;re asking you guys to
help us with
so what i want to do next is to show
a number of clips of some interesting
interviews
that are really astonishing
the next the first one is
astonishing in the sense that we got it
on record
so about two weeks ago i
interviewed at the watergate in
washington
the son of a member of the committee
that had been dealing with ufos and e.t
issues
for a number of years and that&#39;s senator
john warner his son is john warner the
fourth
and john warner the fourth um is also
the grandson of paul mellon and the paul
mellon
when the few billionaires at the end of
world war ii
and he told me the very first time i met
him five or six years ago
john warner the four said look my entire
family
or fascists and he didn&#39;t mean it in the
way that it&#39;s bandied around now of
course
you know now anyone you disagree with
you call a fascist is terrible
but i mean in the true sense that they
were ardent supporters
of fascism supporters of adolf hitler
until we declared war and this includes
prescott bush
george h.w bush&#39;s father henry ford
uh watson of ibm and paul mellen
and he informed me that at the end of
world war ii his father
actually went over with general patton
and with alan dulles now this is a
founding family we&#39;re talking about here
paul mellon and his grandson is telling
the story
of the cia and this whole covert program
so let&#39;s listen to these now this is a
three-hour interview
so we have just a few clips here but i
want to share them with you
because they&#39;re very important
project paperclip most likely we got
five thousand or more
scientists uh we got i heard we got
train loads
of paperwork mature non-linear physics
experiments walter gerlach&#39;s
research the death camp research
we got all that as well as you know
the the bell project plasma accelerator
you know all that kind of stuff in that
deal my granddad and i when we were
talking i&#39;ll never forget it and he said
he was talking about patton
and of course he said i was in
czechoslovakia with patton in april 45.
and i thought oh that was neat what&#39;d
you do and he&#39;s like well you know they
patton had to secure a lot of the stuff
that the ss had and i said oh that&#39;s
interesting and
you know and today we know it is the
sse4 division
under hans kommler general hans commler
and of course gestapo mueller
also had a security three levels of
security around that town
which was pretty dense and of course the
ss we know today had their own funding
streams
they were totally independent of the
reichstag and you know a lot of that
treasure in switzerland they had access
to unlimited funds
right which sounds a lot like the deep
state today
and so i said what were you doing with
patton he said it was interesting
memory serves that granddad told me they
were with general marshall
but i could be wrong on that but i
remember that he said he
was with patton probably maybe marshall
maybe some other generals and they said
well we went into this
warehouse and there were all these
exotic you know jet aircraft rocket
engines parts of the v2
and maybe a v3 i don&#39;t know i said oh
that&#39;s interesting he says i saw a
disc shaped aircraft
and i said i&#39;ve known i&#39;d done some
history work by that time
i said oh is that the one they built i
can&#39;t remember who built it errato
or maybe someone else that had the bmw
jet engines and the errata ones in a
circle
and it didn&#39;t really work and everything
like that and he said
no
and that was it it was time for lunch
the guests had arrived the wine flowed
blah blah blah blah and i went away as a
college student i was like well that&#39;s
interesting
and it didn&#39;t hit me until i read nick
cooke&#39;s book i think in 2004
and i was like okay this is getting
really weird
because you know in 1993 when i was 31
i showed the majestic 12 documents to my
dad
and we went back and forth on that
and i said you know i&#39;ve heard of you
know roswell and pelona peak and corona
i&#39;ve heard of some of these ufo crashes
but
are these real and he said oh no you
know that you know i&#39;ve checked with the
pentagon the fbi
it&#39;s all hoax and we went back and forth
for months on this and he finally
said look just don&#39;t go down that road
you know he says live your life enjoy
yourself but don&#39;t
you know they have it all under control
they know what they&#39;re doing
and i said dad how the hell can i
live my life if this is the truth of our
world
so so this disc in the warehouse
obviously we got it and it ended up
somewhere in the united states
probably wright-patterson right field as
they called it back then
i am not a documents expert but i know
60s mimeograph sheets like
you and i had in school i mean they
smell funny yes
he&#39;s a guy in my car club and he was you
know in the air force
his father was a three-star general in
the air force i&#39;m not going to say his
name
i i promise i never would as i
understand that i mean you know it&#39;s
just my story you know
but um he and i started talking about
this and he says you know my wife and i
have seen all kinds of strange phenomena
we&#39;ve had you know glowing foo fighters
come into our home and you know all this
stuff
and he says i want to show you something
and so his father left him
a large safe then he said well i had to
get my navy seal buddy over here with
some c4 and they blew the hinges off
and you can see where they blew the damn
hinges off i said holy
and inside were air force documents with
you know
disc craft and a lot of technical terms
in german
which i thought was interesting and he
said these were from
58 to 63 i think
and the dates were on them and i&#39;ve
recognized the terms you know vortex
compression
you know plasma accelerator you know uh
zero you know
zero point uh gravitational field you
know all this stuff and
the schematic had an air force serial
number
and we were just flipping through them
hundreds of them
now these looked a lot like the german
hanabu ones the vril saucers you know
three maneuvering nodes underneath
you know powdered quartz with monatomic
gold and insulators and
torsion field maneuvering nodes that we
know now i figured that out
i actually sketched that out a tr-3b
black triangle
how it worked with the plasma ring and
the three nodes with monatomic gold and
powdered quartz
to chris millen and he&#39;s like oh wow you
and tom delonger into the wild stuff
i just shook my head and i was like okay
whatever
but atomic weapons and i&#39;m sure you know
this oppenheimer was famous for saying i
have become death
the destroyer of worlds crick well
that&#39;s from the vedic texts
yeah and what he found out from the
vedic tests that the ananer
ss and all those tula society and
everyone else and all the
societies knew and rudolf steiner and
gerd jeff probably knew
the theosophists was that when you light
off a nuclear weapon of a certain
yield it not only affects the local
battlefield at hand
but it rips through several dimensions
of the universe
the local universe and you get
additional
casualties and that&#39;s why when we
started you know
the germans tested one in the baltic in
october of 44
i think that&#39;s was true the navy did the
zinser report on it
we go through these yuga cycles and all
of a sudden
it&#39;s like atlantis again we&#39;re starting
to do uh
you know uh material science you know uh
regressive you know actions you know
chimera construction with dna
atomic weapons again and scalar
and free energy weapons which can crack
the earth in half
correct dangerous stuff
dangerous stuff you know as you said
firecrackers but it&#39;s more than
firecrackers these kids are playing with
c4 and they&#39;re three years old
yeah yeah they&#39;re three-year-olds
playing with c4 chunks of it as big as
this table you know enough to blow up
an entire house you know it&#39;s it&#39;s
incredibly dangerous
and so oppenheimer knew that and the
other person that worked with
oppenheimer at the rad lab at mit
not only was vannevar bush he was big
time ufo file
was john g trump the president&#39;s uncle
correct so that&#39;s how president trump
knew a lot about all this that we&#39;re
talking about it&#39;s because his uncle
and he were close and his uncle was read
in
along with vane of our bush and
oppenheimer and everybody on the foo
fighter file
as it was known back then and the german
atomic program our atomic program
the klystron ii scalar weaponry radar
research you know and all that stuff at
the rad lab
that was the area 51 you know if you at
mit where the eggheads were
but right field in ohio was the
place in those days but that&#39;s something
every american should understand
is john g trump because a lot of his
physics work is still classified
yes and why right yes
i&#39;m of the opinion they&#39;re given a very
thin file to work from
and you know chris and i have met we&#39;ve
talked about all this stuff um
i think the ttsa program was a little
goofy with tom delong
i don&#39;t know what you know how put off
was one you know soliciting me for funds
for his quantum communication thing
which i think the navy has had for 30
years
so there&#39;s a lot of disconnects going on
and of course they&#39;ve left that tts bay
program and i don&#39;t blame them
uh i think it was a show and uh
some type of cia you know quasi psyop
something
and i don&#39;t think anybody was really
excited about it
i was a little hard on him and i will
because
i was expecting much more disclosure
after four years
of this and when they say this is a
mystery we need to solve
that is not true as you and i know the
us military especially the navy
has reams of information on every shape
of craft
where it&#39;s from who&#39;s driving it what
they&#39;re up to
you know forget it&#39;s just been going on
for 70 years uh the military industrial
complex is not stupid
neither is all the branches of the
military they know exactly what&#39;s going
on
and this tic-tac the word is it&#39;s
lockheed martin it&#39;s the successor to
the tr3g
black triangle model and of course there
are stories by charles hall
that the uh tall white ets out at the
indian springs s4 and the nellis range
had these lo and behold these white tic
tac looking things
that they used as buses and so i&#39;m
thinking
aha maybe there&#39;s a connection there and
maybe that validates some of his story
and so when you start piecing all this
together
you know you know i&#39;m glad that they&#39;re
doing something
but it&#39;s you know elizondo just will
talk the bark off a tree he goes in
circles
he&#39;s a great counterintelligence guy i&#39;d
love to get into debate with him
but of course that&#39;s never gonna happen
um
you know it&#39;s i think chris
means well i i really do i don&#39;t think
he&#39;s one of these guys
you know that&#39;s going around here i&#39;m
gonna fool the public and get paid for
it he doesn&#39;t need the money i don&#39;t
need
money we don&#39;t need famer money that&#39;s
the last thing a melon wants i&#39;m telling
you
uh we&#39;re very private as a family i can
pretty much guarantee you that
his brother was in the press a little
bit but you know
i think he he sees this as a patriotic
job
i think he believes that that report is
genuine and there&#39;s
maybe not much more and then that he&#39;s
okay
with this is what i&#39;m allowed to talk
about
and the rest of it is national security
and that cannot be talked about
they&#39;ve lied by a mission and when they
say it&#39;s a mystery that&#39;s
that&#39;s a lie okay i&#39;m sorry but that you
know
i&#39;m not on board with that and that you
know but but they have to know that&#39;s a
lie right
so they they do and i think you know
it&#39;s obvious
so you know that&#39;s why i&#39;m giving this
interview with you today i mean i&#39;ve had
enough
uh of that i had enough with my dad you
know was he a liaison to majestic 12 as
a magic member
probably you know he probably had two
pages of the ufo file you know
don&#39;t worry about the rest of it just
two pages are all you eat
okay yes sir you know and chris is going
yes sir too
whatever factions in the pentagon is
united everything is factions
whatever factions they represent it&#39;s
like well we want to have disclosure
but not not really real disclosure and
so
they&#39;re they&#39;re slowing everything down
i don&#39;t understand why chris is involved
either except
in my opinion this is just me
i think there&#39;s a reason they picked a
melon because we&#39;ve had other families
this is a tradition in our family
you know as you said the melons were the
first family of intelligence
well i agree with that from my you know
the people that i&#39;ve talked to uh that
will go along with
you know we need to do this for the good
of the country you know
yes you gotta lie and do whatever you
have to do but you know this is what we
need to do
and they&#39;ll just do it and um
you know i&#39;m i&#39;m a private citizen i&#39;ve
never worked for the government or the
military
but i you know i&#39;m not going to get up
there
i mean i&#39;m not going to you know stay
silent when members of my family lie to
the american people i won&#39;t do that
it&#39;s one thing for my dad you know in
the old days to get up there and do some
mild fibs about you know highways
this is not you&#39;re messing around with
the survival
capability of the human race correct i
mean i&#39;m not
that&#39;s not an overstatement right this
is deadly serious
it&#39;s not funny right
you&#39;re sort of half joking but i thought
you were somewhat serious that you said
you know a lot of my family are fascists
or we&#39;re fascists or
fascist sympathizers and you talk about
that a little bit even it&#39;s a little bit
uncomfortable oh there&#39;s no doubt i mean
andrew mellon was
upfront about it he was uh secretary of
the treasury
under harding and hoover uh he was
ambassador to the court of st
james in 1931 a good friend of the royal
family
that&#39;s where this mellon royal family
thing connection comes in
uh his outdated policies with
rockefeller morgan
carnegie duponts you know that made the
great depression much
worse i believe i&#39;ve also heard that you
know he was
uh heavily invested in dupont&#39;s nylon
which came around in the late 30s for
naval rope and of course
hemp and marijuana were made strategic
materials and
therefore illegal of course it was a war
on consciousness too oh we don&#39;t want
people smoking those
jazz cigarettes you know that would be
bad you know
and so you know andre and they of course
their dealings with sullivan and
cromwell on wall street
the dulles brothers john foster dulles
and ellen dulles
oh invest in nazi germany you know
hitler&#39;s a great guy he&#39;s a republican
don&#39;t worry about it you&#39;ll make lots of
money and then standard oil
you know through straw man and portugal
all during the war
i mean business thrives during war you
know that it&#39;s a racket
and so you know my grandfather wasn&#39;t
the industrialist
kind of war profiteer that andrew was
but he was more into the mystic
intelligence side for sure
and if you&#39;re bottom line brass tacks if
you&#39;re on the cfr with allen dulles
you&#39;re in the trailer animal commission
you&#39;re on the jason society you&#39;re
scrolling key at yale
which scrolling key and the skull and
bones are directly connected to the tula
society of germany in the vril society
um and you&#39;re a knight of the
order of orange nassau you&#39;ve got a kbe
from the queen
my dad does too um you&#39;re not
a friend of the common american uh
you&#39;re just not you&#39;re a very
you know neocon ultra conservative you
know i don&#39;t
buy this whole yes he was a gentleman
horse racer
you know he had a racing team of stables
he he was donated the national gallery
the east wing
his father donated the other national
gallery you know these are things they
did
in my opinion so that the american
people would put a gold wreath on their
heads and go
what great oligarchs these guys are
billionaires oligarchs
see what great things they do now that&#39;s
a great thing to do to donate an art
museum
but it&#39;s a great cover story i mean
andrew mellon had intimate dealings with
halmar
shocked who was hitler&#39;s private banker
and so did sullivan and comwell
i mean this is this is dirty nasty
history
and uh it doesn&#39;t make i don&#39;t
it took me years really to gather
all the intelligence bits and to come up
you know a lot of it i&#39;m
connecting dots on my own but they make
sense to me given my german history and
the history of
the military-industrial complex and
everything and why the melons are so
active still
and you know secrecy and big money and
these big
american families some call them the
committee of 300.
that&#39;s probably a loose term but you
know i&#39;ve never heard it but
you know it makes sense to me yeah i&#39;ve
had that confirmed that it&#39;s it&#39;s
a committee around 300 that are involved
in in these
operations and it&#39;s not just
extraterrestrial ufo
it&#39;s a whole lot of aspects of
technology finance
global geopolitical
my friend who was an oni navy captain he
we had a dinner one night and he said
you know
i said what can you tell me and he spent
30 years in the on i
and he said well you know we&#39;re pretty
proud of our satellites you know we&#39;re
competing with the air force and they&#39;re
two-man satellites we&#39;ve got our own
two-man satellites
interesting and they you know they have
scalar weaponry and he&#39;s like well i
can&#39;t comment to that
you know more wine more wine and he said
i said tell me about the your tracking
systems and he says oh
you know that&#39;s that&#39;s i love that he&#39;s
like we can track
those bastards uap ufos
punching in and out super luminal and we
can track them 25 miles onto the earth
under the earth or the ocean yes
and tell me a little bit about mount
weather and whether you use that i think
a lot of people don&#39;t know
why that was important at that time
the official narrative is that mount
weather was built in the blue ridge
during the kennedy administration as a
continuance of government cog
and i think it still is um
my dad&#39;s been down under there um my dad
also tells me about the high-speed train
they have
because during 9 11 he
told me that i said because i was out of
touch with him with five days he said
well they had us out dc to an
undisclosed location
it wasn&#39;t mount weather it was in west
virginia in seven minutes and i said
oh is that the maglev train that goes
mach 2 and a vacuum tube
oh well how did you know that you know
my dad always wonders how i know this
stuff
but mount weather um
the rumors are that it goes down you
know probably a mile or two
down to the sub-shuttle system and
connects to other
deep underground military bases
why else it&#39;s in the blue ridge in that
low specific location i&#39;m not sure
but it&#39;s a top secret facility it&#39;s
still very active and expanding
and if they&#39;re expanding on the surfaces
you know they&#39;re probably expanding
tenfold beneath the surface
right correct yeah had your grandfather
paul mellon been in
mount weather oh i&#39;m sure but he never
told me that
right um i don&#39;t remember that as part
of our conversation
but certainly that&#39;s all connected with
his
jet strips and his meetings and about
whether you know these are all connected
things
you know for all i know there&#39;s a tunnel
from his farm to mount weather i mean i
have no
idea but it wouldn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t surprise
me
if that were true um and i i don&#39;t take
pleasure in any of this
this this family history is very
disturbing and and actually
disheartening for me steps from a
three-hour
interview with um john warner the fourth
grandson of paul mellon
and son of a member of the committee the
majority intelligence committee
um who&#39;s still alive and is about 94 um
and there&#39;s a great deal more
information obviously in the interest of
time
we can&#39;t go through all of it we want to
pick a few highlights to give you an
idea of the depth
of the archive we have we&#39;re trying to
put together
a multi-year you know 10 20 episodes per
year
disclosure file series for a major
streaming group because
we have about 200 hours of
riveting content that we have in our
archives and
the world needs to see it and i&#39;d like
to get it out before i uh meet my maker
so that&#39;s that&#39;s what we&#39;re working on
now there&#39;s another very important
uh video i&#39;d like to to show and uh it&#39;s
one that relates to the case we had
earlier the cash land room case so we
can show that from air force office of
special investigations
uh richard doty
were there human pilots on board i never
saw it land so i don&#39;t know
i don&#39;t know air force pilot who piloted
them
only the one only the cash lander i
actually interviewed him
there were four of them i mean there&#39;s
two there was two fi the two
pilots there was a uh
a systems officer that was
handling the the equipment and then
there was a
i can&#39;t remember what the fourth person
did he was the navigator of what he was
and
i i interviewed them and and everything
that could have gone wrong
it took off fine from nevada and flew
perfectly
but when they said it was it was going
to
an air base i can&#39;t remember which air
base it was some air base in texas
i think it was webb air force base
in big springs i think it was yeah i&#39;m
pretty sure it was wep
and when they tried to slow it down
that&#39;s when the problems happen
and then they cut power and so many
things went wrong
that uh they almost crashed they called
for rescue helicopters they thought
we&#39;re going to crash
so these helicopters came out but they
finally got it
going again and they landed at some
place
apparently it was just past where they
spurred all this radiation on those two
port p
or three people or however many it were
and then they then they flew it back to
nevada it was pretty huge it was a uh
one of those big ones it was a uh it was
uh
not a saucer shape it was more
huge oval shape it was it was
it was reverse engineered yeah they
trained
nine months before they ever flew it
and then they trained another i can&#39;t
remember how long four or five months
flying it all around nevada
and it worked fine but the problem is
it&#39;s a it&#39;s a reverse engineered
alien craft with it one of our
nuclear propulsion systems well that
wasn&#39;t refined because
they couldn&#39;t figure out how to reverse
engineer the aliens
they they got it to work at times
but they couldn&#39;t manipulate it the way
they they needed to for a human pilot to
fly it
so they had to put one of our uh
a propulsion system in it and it you
know it malfunctioned
and they trained and there wasn&#39;t any
the pilot told me they were flying and
everything
seemed they were flying at a high all i
can remember what altitude it was
flying perfectly fine no problems
whatsoever
until they slowed down he said and then
uh hell broke loose then the
system just malfunctioned and they had
this uh
some something that was supposed to
throw thrust
but the thruster was moving all around
and
they had a filter some kind of filter
that was filtering supposed to filter
that didn&#39;t work
that didn&#39;t come down and it was just
a mess you know what kind of velocities
this craft reached
uh it could go uh mach one
and i i that&#39;s all i was told and maybe
probably more than that but uh just what
he told me
pilot told me when i interviewed him was
he he
he had up the mach 1. it sounds like a
hybrid craft had some aspects of the et
craft and
yeah the body and everything was e.t the
only thing that was propulsion was
our it was us with american and and uh
or are conventional or actually a
nuclear
uh and it just didn&#39;t work and there
were four humans yeah four
four humans in it and none of them
suffered any radiation problems it&#39;s
just those poor people on the ground
a couple of nuclear weapons sent into
space were destroyed by the
extraterrestrials
in talking to various contacts
throughout they would allude to the fact
that
these did happen there was for example
the missile minuteman missile was
destroyed of the launch from vandenberg
air force base
that&#39;s now a public matter record the
one
incident for example was they they
actually photographed the
ufo following the missile as it climbed
into space
and shining a beam on it which
neutralized the
the missile and that is their major
concern
is to preserve the integrity of the
earth
because it affects their own
system well there was one incident when
we exploded a nuclear weapon over the
pacific and this was in about 61 i
believe
and the conservation that it caused
because it shut out
communications entirely with the pacific
basin
for a number of hours in which no radio
transmission was available at any time
and this was very significant and of
course
this was one of the things that the
extraterrestrials later i learned were
highly concerned about
because it affected our
ionosphere and in fact
spacecraft were unable to operate
because of the pollution in the magnetic
field
of which they depended upon the very end
of the 70s and early 80s
we attempted to put a nuclear weapon on
the moon and explode it
for scientific measurements and other
things
which was not acceptable to the
extraterrestrials
and what happened they destroyed the
weapon
before it got to the moon with reference
to the incident
which our government sent a nuclear
weapon
for explosion on the moon&#39;s surface
it was tended to as i understand it
to assess some scientific data and
reaction and so forth
the idea of any explosion in space
by any earth government was not
acceptable to the
extraterrestrials and that has been
demonstrated
over and over and what&#39;s the consequence
how is that demonstrated
by the destruction of any nuclear
weapons sent
into space thank you guys
and again uh thank you for all attending
and everyone online thank you guys for
your
participation and your help and all of
you helped make this
a whole event possible the next person
who will be presenting
is paula harris and paul and harrison
i&#39;ve known each other for at least
22 years and she has been so
pivotal in assisting with the disclosure
project
and when she lived in rome was a teacher
there
but also a journalist investigating this
issue and hosted me
in rome and introduced me to some
amazing people
not only at the vatican like monsignor
balducci but also
uh some scientists and military
officials
uh vatican astronomers etc and she&#39;s
just done
an enormous body of work since the 70s
on this subject
including really intimate relationships
with colonel corso
getting to know him and his whole story
very well
uh all the way back to people like dr j
allen heineck
who was of course the head of the
project blue book
back in in the 60s so we&#39;re really
honored to welcome
paula harris thank you
no it&#39;s really me that&#39;s honored to be
here
this is a historical occasion and when
stephen asked me to speak i
said yes this needs to get done we&#39;re
going to do it
this happens to be not entertainment for
me
this happens to be part of my life
journey as a journalist so my first
slide
was me speaking at the washington press
club
with the x conference representing
journalists i am not a ufologist
although we have a field of ufology
unfortunately that doesn&#39;t help the
situation very much
so my job is to just get the testimony
for you
to put it i&#39;ve written five books in
three different languages
so that you can make up your mind what&#39;s
going on
and it shouldn&#39;t be told to you on
youtube
it should not be told to you by other
people
you&#39;re intelligent enough to know what&#39;s
going on
and before uh you know i even begin
i have to acknowledge my colleagues and
the brave heroes
that walk their talk and stephen said
we&#39;ve known each other for 22 years
and he was i brought him to europe to
testify
because this is not an american
phenomenon this is an international
phenomenon
and stephen had an effect on people in
italy
and when he spoke in barcelona spain he
is the only one
one thousand four hundred people gave
him a standing ovation
one thousand four hundred people who
were not
into entertainment who came to that
conference if you remember were
scientists
they were uh people who were
professional there were no tinfoil hats
nobody bought gadgets and it was
not a circus atmosphere i had never
spoken
to 1 400 people anywhere except
barcelona spain and i was shocked that
it was not
a circus atmosphere and stephen got a
standing ovation in fact there&#39;s going
to be a slide of him because he has an
orb on one of his shoulders
i don&#39;t know who that was he&#39;s very
strange sometimes
and i want to acknowledge danny sheehan
for his his contribution he was the
not only the counsel for the disclosure
project
he was at another disclosure event which
was the citizen hearing
of 2013 that had
36 men and one woman
if you remember the the citizen hearing
in washington dc
where there were 36 different
people from south american countries
from europe they&#39;re from england uh
it was england italy uruguay paraguay
if you don&#39;t think disclosure has
happened
i don&#39;t know are you sleeping what do
you think disclosure is
the latest flavor of ice cream that
comes out of the media
this is the problem with this whole
thing is
that people think they&#39;re misguided they
think
that what comes out of the um
government is going to be disclosure
that&#39;s not where disclosure is
disclosure is a serious study of this
phenomenon
and unfortunately people don&#39;t read
anymore because if they go back to read
the original source material
starting from leonard stringfield alan
heineck and so forth
all the people that worked on this for
years
and they would do it scholarly they
would get disclosure
the the dot four diaries of jacques
valley have
days day by day entries
of all of the process of what has been
going on with all the
groups that tried to get together to
have some kind of disclosure
unfortunately this particular country
is interested in one thing
the technology and in the 1950s if you
bothered to
look at the giant rock group for you
people that date back
the people that met the band tassels the
mengers
the the early contactees and i had to go
back there
to study this because i was our field
and i i&#39;m the only one that&#39;s going to
mention this
is little grey aliens
abductions and all kinds of mythologies
that are unproven
and that when you go to a conference
that&#39;s what you&#39;re seeing and i&#39;m
thinking to myself oh my god
do they bother to go back and see in the
1950s and the reason why i go back to
the 1950s
is because it goes back further than
that and that&#39;s the case i&#39;m going to
talk about
1945. what happened
july 16 1945
we exploded the atomic bomb
so it&#39;s no coincidence that all that
stuff happened in new mexico
because that&#39;s the history that began
this problem and i&#39;ve heard all kinds of
testimony now because
it the explosion of an atomic bomb
has repercussions in other dimensions
it doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to
figure that out
that somebody we got somebody&#39;s
attention
we got somebody&#39;s attention i&#39;ve heard
this before but you know the kids have
discovered the matches
and you can&#39;t put the genie back in the
bottle
so let&#39;s start this with the first slide
i
spoke to the washington press club
because
at that time stephen bassett had asked
me to speak to journalists and
of course what i said is look you guys
just tell the story the way it is don&#39;t
put a spin on it
and there was a series of international
people there so what did the washington
post do
the red vote the uh the
blue vote and the little green man vote
so they made fun of it so the media
is not on board here
so i i asked them to do that by the way
in barcelona i was the only one
with all men at the uh
here at the national press club i was
the only woman
thank you stephen thank you stephen
basser for letting me
speak but more thank you stephen gur for
having two women
because this is the woman&#39;s perspective
is a whole other perspective here
and this is a field of men and so
you heard carol speak sometimes we get
some things done
and sometimes we see the 360 picture
so i am very grateful to him for
changing the paradigm
all right so i tried washington press
club next
but you know i didn&#39;t pick this um
in 1979 i watched close encounters of
the third kind of got very emotional
at the very end when there was that
contact if you remember francois
truffaut that met the
beings at the very end and i was a
teacher
like carol i i taught high school for 40
years and i have a master&#39;s in education
so i&#39;m always going to talk about
reading and getting educated
so what happened is i was at a wedding
in evanston illinois
i walked into the center for ufo studies
and
by coincidence ellen heineck was there
and i went up to him and i said is this
real
are you is this what i saw in that movie
was that real
and he said yes he was working at
project blue book at the time and he
said yes he said i heard you speak
italian and i said i do
and he said would you help me would you
help me uh with the italian sightings
i&#39;m going to send you some boxes
full of letters i&#39;m getting from all
over the world
so i was lucky whoever gave me this
assignment
gave me the best teacher how can you
have any better teacher than allen
heineck
who&#39;s an astronomer and a scientist so
i&#39;m dealing with real science and we&#39;re
and working with ellen that&#39;s a very
young paula harris there
uh taught me to listen
it taught me to listen put together
facts
do not make judgments and collect the
material
okay next and you can see
at a sense of humor and i think we need
one i&#39;m so overloaded by what i&#39;ve heard
and what i&#39;ve seen and alex said laugh
laugh study study let&#39;s not forget our
sense of humor here
like and i miss him so much because i
worked with him for six years
and he taught me a lot um go ahead
okay what happened in 19 i think was
1999 was that stephen grier came to
italy and he
asked me to help them with the
disclosure project which met we rented a
room near the train station in rome and
we
filed all these military people in and
they gave testimony we filmed it
and then he asked me to meet monsignor
corrado balducci
of the vatican who made the statement
the next one
um there&#39;s monsignor balducci
with stephen he said we don&#39;t the devil
doesn&#39;t need
ufos and this is very important because
one of the problems that i thought at
that time
that had to do with disclosure was that
uh it had to do with the downfall of
religions or people panicking and so
forth
and he said no he uh he actually said
i&#39;m a demonologist this has nothing to
do with the devil
believe it or not in roswell once they
put me on a panel to talk about the
devil
and i said to these and these were
engineers
and i said why are you doing that and
they said wouldn&#39;t you rather believe in
jesus christ
than aliens he said are you out of your
minds
this is not about religion so get a clue
and if you attribute it to the box of
religion
then we will never learn the truth
wouldn&#39;t it be
great if we could learn we had
friends out there
if this planet was not the only one
if there is a civilization that&#39;s more
evolved
and that is what balducci said
he told steve and he said look we&#39;re at
the bottom of the barrel
he said and all these years we have not
evolved
he said they&#39;re watching us and trying
to get us to a point
where we understand how amazing we are
and how it filled this universe is with
life
and we&#39;re just part of it and he
and of course i&#39;d interpret because he
didn&#39;t speak english very well
but i want you to unders there&#39;s
zechariah sitchin with
uh with uh monsignor bulducci i took the
photo
the photos i take them because i&#39;m a
photojournalist
so i&#39;m going to take the photos of the
history of this because
this state&#39;s bad for me from 1980 go
ahead the next one
so these are some of the things
that monsignor belducci said uh
catholicism he said this is very
important you have to understand this
is based on witness testimony the whole
religion
the apostles and so forth why aren&#39;t
we believing the witnesses
to the ufo phenomenon if we&#39;ve created a
whole religion around witness testimony
he said see my talk today is more on
logic and ethics that&#39;s logical
all the witnesses would you need not
only military
which stephen has filed in all these
military
credible scientists but there&#39;s
people out there that have witnessed
this phenomena
that should also be taken seriously the
next one
there&#39;s stephen on the stage in
barcelona
and there is the orb that appeared
who took that picture i did uh i had to
because
it was a historic conference
those people were really interested in
most of the people there except javi
sierra who was the moderator
were american and bob dean was there
if you remember robert dean he was with
us yes go ahead
okay so my book conversations with
colonel corso will give you
a um word by word conversation with what
with him in other words what it is is
all the audio tapes that i took
while i was um working with corso
but i&#39;m going to tell you a story about
this um i don&#39;t know do we have the
corso clip for
let&#39;s let&#39;s play that for them because
i&#39;ll tell you what happened with colonel
philip corso
you need to know the real story
sometimes i feel i am the voice of
people who are no longer here
right today right people
hear these things we don&#39;t know what the
humanoid clone what advancements he can
make or how we can make one
so what you have to do you have to you
can&#39;t go to the library and get
reference books on how he was built
you can&#39;t go anyplace and find this
information you have to start from zero
it&#39;s a new science i told you the answer
you have to start from zero promote a
new science
that&#39;s what you would that&#39;s what you
people have to do and not only that
i tell you i tell you i&#39;ll promote a new
science
i might only give you a little bit of
help you have to do the rest yourselves
and if you can&#39;t you can&#39;t carry it on
turtle but humans could turn into robots
with this new science how do we
you know what you know but you know what
dr mari what i told him and he agreed
and my own doctor this would
be a great boom for mankind if we could
give man
with new muscles new bones new organs
do you realize what that would bring to
mankind that&#39;s what this thing did
geez medical science is coming
look at the new advances in medical
science that we can make
this man changed my life and he also
changed ufology and i&#39;ll tell you the
reason
um okay here&#39;s the books uh in italian
uh on colonel corso my books in french
go ahead and put the
okay here is his background
you could read it the head of
intelligence the age of 28 in rome i
could verify all that because i dragged
him around
rome and he verified everything go ahead
here we are in rome go ahead this stop
here
in 1997
was the 50th anniversary of the roswell
crash
my boss sent me to look for colonel
phillip
corso he said the book the day after
roswell came
up paula you need to cover this i was in
italy i did not want to come
i had other things i wanted to do i
didn&#39;t know what he looked like i didn&#39;t
know what i was supposed to do with him
i got to but they there are some people
that could drive me there
once i got here and i got to roswell
it was a big party
there was all the major ufo people
and colonel curso was there and
i didn&#39;t know what he looked like but i
went to
the uh where he was having a press
conference
and a blonde man pushed me into the
crowd and said
you have to speak to my father in
italian i said
who are you and he said i&#39;m colonel
corso&#39;s son
i asked colonel corso about the santelli
footage
in an alien autopsy in italian and he
answered
and he said that seems real he said
because that lens
now remember little grey aliens that we
see that we have these big eyes he said
that was a lens he said and we pull that
off he said
we back in bed engineered night
screening
devices from it and he told everybody
colonel corso could not speak in this
country for the jealousy
and the court case against his book
so we promptly pulled him to italy and
he testified
on two different occasions in pescada
and the independent
uh republic of san marino now when i
tell you this
i&#39;m telling you that sometimes our own
people stop
our own people from testifying because
it was very very interesting that he
spoke in italy
so this is the autopsy of the ets
and it&#39;s in the book conversations with
colonel corso go ahead
keep going we&#39;ll go really fast here we
are in rome
i brought him to europe this is a
conversation
he told me that i had to talk about this
and i said i can&#39;t i
can&#39;t do this and he said you&#39;ll learn
you&#39;re a soldier
and i&#39;m a woman i&#39;m going what do you
mean you learn i&#39;m not a soldier he said
after i&#39;m gone you must talk about this
go ahead
there we are go ahead all right so
from that point of view i heard that the
former defense minister had read corso&#39;s
book
had called some um military men here
and what this man said was
i verify what corso said about back
engineering
and more and when i realized what this
was really about i realized that&#39;s what
the secret was
it wasn&#39;t people were going to panic
this is about
uh creating back engineering go ahead
now this is the story that stephen has
been talking about
when we uh
detonated the atomic bomb somebody
noticed
so that 1947 roswell which has become a
party if you go there
was not the first crash it was 1945 go
ahead
it was in san antonio new mexico
two little boys remy baka and jose
padilla
were looking for a cow that was calving
and that
had a calf and what had happened is they
were they watched a ufo come in
hit a radio tower and and actually crash
a piece of it fell off and they saw the
beings inside
this is a case i&#39;ve been covering for
the last
nine years it really happened
i believe that the files on this are in
the atomic energy commission files and
not on the blue book files go ahead
and here&#39;s jose and here&#39;s remy
one is nine one is six they&#39;re children
they&#39;re telling the truth this really
happened
i did an interview for stephen that
you&#39;ll see in the
in the um documentary of the details of
this
this is important because it was one
month after the atomic bomb
so these ets this civilization
were not on vacation this was a
statement to planet earth
the boys saw the creatures
they stayed there for at least 20 to 25
minutes
and watched it go ahead
now why is that important because at
that time and there&#39;s oppenheimer and i
heard the
the uh testimony i am death the killer
of
worlds which is what our that that
trinity
plaque is near uh near the site they&#39;re
13 miles from where this crash was
i am death i have created death
the killer of worlds plural oppenheimer
is having a conversation with einstein
go ahead
protocols were discussed either
oppenheimer and einstein said we got
problems here you think oppenheimer that
wasn&#39;t there didn&#39;t know about this
crash it was one month after the atomic
bomb go ahead
there is a document mj12 document it&#39;s
called
relationships with inhabitants of
celestial
bodies it&#39;s a mj12 document there it is
you can go on ryan wood&#39;s website
and read it and what it says basically
go ahead
what it says is hey president truman we
got problems
we&#39;re having visitations because
something happened and this is a month
after the atomic bomb
and it says we&#39;ve got to do something
the united nations cannot cover this
we&#39;re going to create a
supra united nations he calls them
cosmic cultures there is no hint
of hostility this document you should go
on ryan
woods uh uh woods website and look at it
relationships with celestial bodies and
it calls them
cultures and in the ufo field all you
see is a little grey alien
we&#39;ve got to understand that there were
also people from other planets coming
here
they in fact colonel corso said we
weren&#39;t worried about the clone
we were worried about who created them
because those things could fly
in outer space but there are actual
you know cultures that created them go
ahead
this is a adamski and it&#39;s very
important because people
my colleagues especially just completely
completely
canceled george adamski when i started
listening to his
uh audio tapes adamski was addressing
all world leaders because in 1952
november 20th 1952 the message from
orton and there&#39;s his footprints
done by georgetown williamson williamson
plaster casts of his shoes if you would
go back to the
damski era we were on a timeline like we
are today
where demski said look orathon that came
off the ship
said this planet is run on a war economy
and if you keep doing this you have to
create the wars
but kennedy wanted to go out in towers
space orthon says
look if you guys change the war economy
to a space economy this
the spin-offs from the space economy
will give you enough money
to still have an economy but you&#39;ll get
to meet us
that is the message of george adamski if
you bother to go back
and do some scholarly study of ufology
he get his audio tapes he went to the
queen of denmark
to the queen of england all over the
world
and the irony is when i want to speak to
people that knew them
the et&#39;s would go in the car with him
the ones that look like
us and it&#39;s very very you should go
ahead
okay so the message of your that&#39;s the
message written
we&#39;d have to create the wars well guess
what we chose
we we&#39;re out of we&#39;re at our enemies so
i don&#39;t know
now we have to go into something else
okay go ahead
there is colonel korsko speaking to
desmond leslie who wrote the books on
adamski
i was listening to the conversations i&#39;d
sit there dinner listen to
desmond and leslie go uh you know
on about meeting george oganski and what
he said go ahead
there i am with dr edward mitchell it&#39;s
time to tell the truth
he said we are not alone and they are
not hostile
and or we would have conflicts a long
time ago
look if they were going to bomb us if
they were going to
attack us they would have attacked us
when we became a threat
why are they going to do in 2021
so all at once in 2021 we become a
threat and we see all this
now there&#39;s an agenda behind everything
god bless edgar mitchell
because he was like you guys
a hero and because it cost him a lot to
come out
talk about ufos but basically he had an
epiphany
when he was in outer space and felt the
consciousness
rise go ahead there&#39;s edgar mitchell on
me
and roswell go ahead now here we go
clifford stone just died february 12th
and i i had his book published but
clifford stone has a message for you
he did 12 crash retrievals
three of them in vietnam
uh his first crash ritual he didn&#39;t know
it i can&#39;t go into detail about
this but when he was picked to do this
he was
18 years old his first crash retrieval
was an
indian town gap indiana in 1969
he had courage enough to speak at your
disclosure
conference and the agenda for colonel
corso were his
was his three grandsons he wanted them
to know that it was real
he was not about making money doing
roswell books or whatever
his agenda was that his son was killed
he had twin sons
his son robert was killed that was the
impetus to come forward at the
at your disclosure project and that
these heroes have an agenda
for the um knowledge of mankind
the agenda of today is not that go ahead
and he just died and he said he had a
first aid manual
with 57 different species in it and
guess what our field has reptilians
greys and
nordics and we got 57 different species
and so we play the reptilians greys and
nordics and we try to shove
there are cosmic cultures out there that
are interested in coming here
to watch the evolution of mankind
and they are not reptilians graves and
nordics go ahead
this is and this is wilbur smith who
said that this subject matter
that the the visitation to the earth is
classified higher than the atomic bomb
go ahead so we&#39;re getting to the end
why would i ever do this i started his
nuts and bolts with ellen heine putting
pins
in in in maps for sightings
and it took me this long to look at what
why this was happening this is a
phenomena
that is created go ahead the next one
this is a phenomenon that is created
to raise the level of consciousness of
this planet because if we don&#39;t grow up
the repercussions are horrible go ahead
here&#39;s colonel carson and me in europe
he had a piece of metal with adam&#39;s
line he only spoke in europe what
happened here
our own people two great two researchers
went after him
so he could not speak here go ahead
there&#39;s there we are and he said i had a
bunch of fiber optics
take the next one paul hellyer
former defense minister everybody
laughed at him be
felt he needed to talk he&#39;s not somebody
off the street
and there&#39;s al gore and carol talked
about ecology
and he had courage to talk about you
know
an inconvenient truth go ahead
and there they are the release of these
technologies could change the planet
this isn&#39;t just about ufo disclosure
this is about changing the order of the
planet
in other words if these technologies
were released
if we could learn to
not look at the borders you know we&#39;re
looking at the united states china
russia
when edgar mitchell was in outer space
his famous quote that i love is he
grabbed
uh he he said i&#39;m going to grab one of
those congress people
he said i&#39;ve seen a little beautiful
blue circle that&#39;s the planet
and say hey you son of a where are
the borders there
this is a quote from edgar mitchell
astronaut apollo 14.
there are no borders to fight for there
is no
humanity is humanity i&#39;m italian but i&#39;m
human first
and i think we&#39;ve got to do something
here we&#39;ve got to redefine humanity
we are humans we all have children we
all want this planet to survive
for me the message is this is it okay
the next one
this we have a problem steven just did
two hours of
our stuff for their stuff go ahead
and then the message from warathon was
that we could go to a space-based
economy instead of a war economy the
next one
so when colonel corso had his encounter
in the desert colonel corso told me this
is the first interview you gave me and i
said i&#39;m not printing this they&#39;re going
to think you&#39;re
nuts i can&#39;t do it he told me that he
had an encounter in the desert with the
being because the craft had
landed he had seen it from the sky this
being came out of a
a cave in um in white sands
and colonel corso being italian he had a
stiletto in his
uh in his boot but he had a gun and he
pointed
at the being and he said friend or foe
and he said paul guess what he said i
said he said neither
he said neither there are no good aliens
or valiantly it&#39;s like there are no good
people or bad people they just
are but look at the agendas and then
colonel carter the bb said do you want
to come aboard
and colonel corso said what do you have
talk for me
a new world if you could take it the
last words of the ce2
5 movie a new world if you can take it
to me is not a hostile statement and i
bless you for putting that in your ce5
movie because
that being knew we were going to do this
today
he knew do you understand there was no
time
so whatever you&#39;re doing today that
being knew you were going to do it
okay go ahead he said paula
a new world will run for you and you
will be in the forefront this is
powerful of course so
i didn&#39;t know what he was talking about
because i&#39;ve learned so much since then
go ahead the next one i leave you with a
question
when any what you think disclosure comes
out
look where it comes out from the look
with the agendas
please use your brains please use logic
and then maybe we can get through this
together and i thank you so much
and we&#39;ll be having more information
coming up somebody left
oh um so we&#39;ll be having uh
more information about this case in 1945
we did an extensive interview on that
and one of the things that was an
interesting correlation
is that those uh children picked up just
bags of these
angel hair like filaments that they
decorated their
christmas trees and then the whole town
got them and it turned out they were
fiber optics and of course corner cursor
talks about the fact
that uh in the in the 1947 crash and
others
they had retrieved these filaments you
put a light at one end it would transmit
it
so so much of the technology
interestingly that&#39;s information systems
have come out what are they held back
the things that need to save the planet
energy propulsion
instead of these advanced sciences were
using oil gas coal nuclear power
we should have been retired 100 years
ago what i call
the lost century
