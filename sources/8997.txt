It was very real. It's like it just happened yesterday. This experience has been with me for my entire life. I was an infant when it happened.

I found myself in this pink and purple atmosphere, floating slowly through pink and purple clouds. I was an infant and being carried over the shoulder of someone I thought was my grandmother. Following behind us were two teeny-tiny Cherubs. They were very small and had wings. They were naked with short curly hair, and were neither sex. One was solid pink and the other, solid purple. It was like they were trying to keep me entertained, and they did! I was trying to catch or touch them, with much laughter and giggles. They were fluttering around us like humming birds. The scenery changed to a beautiful landscape of green valleys and hills. I could not see what was to the left, but I could hear the laughter of children playing. I asked if I could go there. I heard a voice in the distance saying, 'NO! You're too young!' Then the scenery and atmosphere changed to a brilliant pastel blue. Standing in mid-air were these huge golden gates. Beyond the gates, there was nothing but a brilliant white light. We heard a loud voice, neither male nor female, coming from all around us saying, 'She needs to go back. It's not her time.'

Through the years as a child, I questioned my mother about this experience, and told her I wanted to go back there. I never got a clear answer. At the age of twelve, I brought it up again. She loved my story and was familiar with it, but at first, she would not give me an answer. She then told me that when I was around six months old, I had died in my grandfather's arms. Unbelievably, I remembered this, and I exclaimed to my mom, 'Yes! I remembered him holding me, crying and screaming, saying to me, 'If you die, I will, too!'' Mom was in shock over how I could have known this, 'because you were only six months old!' This memory is so vivid today, it's like it happened only yesterday. I have been trying to find someone else who has had an experience similar to this, with the tiny Cherubs.
