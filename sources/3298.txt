Introduction
IN
the course of the centuries God's plan for
men evolves. There is nothing forced, nothing
haphazard. The plan grows as the flower grows
according to immutable laws. No foolish ideas of
crazed humanity, no selfish greed of individuals
who misuse their power, no hopeless patchwork
due to the breaking of Divine Law can change the
steady onward march of events. "Though the mills
of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding
small." Justice rules, not blindly, her eyes ob
scured by the tapestry of time, but in full light
of day with knowledge of the ultimate end in the
working of the great plan for men.
Have we then no part in this vast panorama of
changeless law? That depends entirely on us. We
may work with the law or against it. We may help
or hinder. Eventually, however, the ultimate aim
appears. If we have been in the way of the sure and
steady onward march of the Divine planning, so
much the worse for us. If, on the contrary, we have
remained true to the highest we know, steady in
the midst of the warring cross-purposes of selfish
and wicked men, we are truly blessed as faithful
soldiers of the Great King.
The purpose of this book is to show God's hand
in the plan for America and our part therein. We

shall devote sufficient time to the past to bring out
clearly the causes set in motion and the logical
effects thereof in the pattern of the future. Just
as each individual life plan has its own character
istic pattern, torn and discolored as the threads
may be, so each nation, each country is weaving
steadily a tapestry of its own, made up of the
people whose destiny is inextricably intertwined
in the fabric, be it tarnished or glorious.
You will need the vision of the eagle to catch
the mountain summits and the valley shadows. No
individual and no nation travels horizontally over
sunlit plains. Progress is not so easy ; evolution not
so unobstructed. The law of life appears to be
struggle —yes, the survival of the fittest. But we
are emerging from the days of brute strength. We
are moving into higher planes, mental and spir
itual. Progress is slow but nonetheless sure, slower
for some than for others, depending on the motive
that is the ruling passion.
As for individuals, so for nations. Each nation
is made up of individuals. If the mass thinking,
so-called, is easily directed by those who pull the
strings, we have a people of puppets, for whom
the path is long and difficult. Each must in the
final analysis think for himself, in the mass but
not of it.
The way of such has always been the path of
martyrdom. It is much easier to go with the crowd
than against it. The prophets have ever been
stoned and put to death. But no people have at any

they have eyes to see, ears to hear and hearts to
understand.
Roll back the pages of Time to the origin of the
Republic of the United States of America and
begin to catch a glimpse of the part to be played
in the drama of the nations by a people who
started out few in number—a mere handful, such
as were the early apostles—pitted against over
whelming strength and apparently hopeless odds.

The Opening of New Frontiers
TN the foregoing chapter we outlined in broad
.J-
principles the course of destiny as helped or
hindered by individuals. We made clear that
nothing can stay the onward march. Though there
may be apparent retrogression, the main arc
is
always upwards. The race moves in spirals: one
period may be lower than others preceding but
it
never reaches the ultimate depth. Each sliding
back
is
a little higher than the one before, as
is
each upward curve. We are measuring now by
group average, not by individuals.
When this country was first touched by the
white race,
a
form of civilization prevailed which
in its knowledge of Nature's laws and its realiza
tion of the Great Spirit was highly ethical. We
have yet to recover some of the spiritual treasures
which were the possession of the Indian tribes
from whom we wrested this continent. The time
had come for their decline and fall, however, as
a
new day dawned in the onward march.
All who came had ventured into the unknown in
search of freedom, wider horizons. This
is
the
dream which has inspired all humanity from the
dawn of Time. In man's heart
is
ever the whisper
of hope for better days, better opportunities to
make his longings realities. Not

gles toward a lost horizon on its return to the
homeland of the Spirit! In the light of common
day among the swine these vague stirrings toward
better things may seem to disappear, but some
time somehow the soul will claim its birthright
and struggle on to reach its spiritual goal.
It was not an easy road for the Colonial fathers
and mothers. Physical hardship was theirs, priva
tion and suffering, constant danger, even torture
and death. But the pioneer spirit admits no de
feat. Ever onward it marches to the land of its
dreams. A mere handful of Colonials pushed back
the French and the Indians, the English and the
Hessians. Weaker men and women would have
succumbed, but God was with them as they kept
their powder dry.
God was with them, too, as brave and wise
leaders framed the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution. Always in the time of crisis
on the upward path a great soul incarnates to
carry out the mandates of the Law. He may not be
conscious in his physical brain that he is a chan
nel through which higher forces operate. But op
erate they do as long as their instrument through
prayer and faith, through one-pointed devotion to
a great aim, keeps the channel open. If God be
with such, who can be against them? Turn back
the pages of history even to Biblical days and
study the miraculous escapes, the incredible over
coming of terrific obstacles. The story is there for
all to see: nothing can stop the Divine Plan. To

understand, we must have the key, the knowledge
of the mystery that is man.
After the thirteen original States had formed
their union, the work was only begun. A great
continent remained to be explored and settled. So
commenced the long march Westward —brave men
and women, who, unknowing to themselves, were
instruments in the plan. Their lives make a story
of the hardship of unsung heroes, a story marked
by simple graves across the plains, along the
mountain slopes. Nothing could stop the march,
however.
Then came the men who could dream dreams in
the mental world and catch the vision of steam
ship, railroad, telephone and telegraph. They, too,
had their suffering in the laughs of the ignorant,
the insults of the crowd. The half-cracked in
ventor, the man ahead of his time, has always been
a favorite target for those who have no vision.
Nonetheless under the guidance of God the work
went on as new frontiers opened, both physical
and mental, and the time was ripe for another
great testing—the Civil War.

Testing Times
THERE
can be no soul growth without testing.
Just as a school requires examinations to
measure the progress of its pupils, so the law of
life is inexorable in its demands on those from
whom great action is expected. The young Repub
lic came to the testing-time with a measure of
protection, the guidance of a great leader. It re
mained, however, for the people themselves to
prove their worth. Under blood and tears North
and South struggled through to eventual unity
though the leader fell when his work was only
partly finished. The nation as a unit was pre
served; it remained only for Time to heal the
wounds on both sides.
Other periods of testing followed, financial and
political. Meanwhile the country developed by
leaps and bounds in spite of the fact that we
muddled through many situations with any but
noble motives. Dark splotches marred the pattern,
imperfect weaving, threads torn and discolored.
The material side of life assumed grotesque pro
portions. The almighty dollar loomed triumphant.
The marts of trade disfigured the courts of the
temple. Periodically when the need arose, the
money-changers had to be driven out as great
financial panics shook the country. Then the mad

whirl began again. New crops of millionaires
sprang like mushrooms from the ruins.
In spite of this criminal and insane emphasis on
money, institutions of learning developed. The
great public school system grew with its free high
schools and colleges. Parents who in youth had
been denied the opportunities of so-called educa
tion resolved that their children should have what
they themselves had lacked. A worthy and noble
aim in and of itself! Wherein was the tragedy?
For tragedy there was and is.
Let us examine the schools. They have done
much good. They have opened new doors to hungry
minds. They have made possible avenues of pro
motion whereby young men and women could raise
themselves from the environment into which they
were born. They have given earnest young souls a
backbone instead of a wishbone. They have made
valuable contacts possible to hungry minds.
We often question, however, whether instead of
bread we have offered a stone. How many young
hearts have been thrilled by spiritual vision? How
many souls have been illumined by "the light that
never shone on land or sea?" How have we an
swered the questions that gnaw at the vitals of
every thinking being? Where do we come from?
Why are we here? Where are we going? Is life
merely "a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and
fury, signifying nothing?"

swer to these questions? Or did your school, your
college send you out to conquer the world, armed
only with the pride of intellect and the snobbish
security of being better than the ignorant man in
the street? Is it any wonder with false conceptions
so rampant that humanity had to be called to an
other halt lest it destroy itself?
Even in this America, this hope of the world,
this great Republic founded on faith and prayer—
to say nothing of brawn and sweat—even here in
the last few decades it has become intellectually
fashionable to question the existence of God, to
teach the overthrow of all the tested standards of
the past—yes, the long tried principles of morality
as based on Biblical concepts. We have been turn
ing out our young with no guide whatever except
the two-edged sword of self-expression. But which
self-expression, the higher or the lower? How
many even know there is a Higher Self?
We cannot blame the schools entirely for this
monstrous miscarriage of education. Look at the
homes of our people today. Many have become
just a place to hang one's hat. Autos, movies,
radios, dance halls with gyrating idiots in a frenzy
of jungle antics—where is there a real home? The
young must have the "good time" which perhaps
their parents lacked. What "good time?" Where
does such emphasis on so-called pleasure inevit
ably lead?
Do not consider this a one-sided picture of only
a small section of American life. The poison has

We have been consistently levelling down, not up.
We have been in a fair way of committing national
suicide. If our young people have remained decent
and self-respecting in spite of our criminal negli
gence it is due to the God within them, for in the
young is the hope of the world.

The Aftermath of War
SUCH
dangerous laxity as discussed in the pre
ceding chapter could not fail to meet with
tragic repercussions. At a time when religious
faith was at a dangerously low ebb, another great
World War developed. We had not learned the
lesson of the holocaust of 1917 - 1919. The reaction
from that was downward. An "eat, drink and be
merry" philosophy prevailed in the frenzied at
tempts of those who had come out of the hell of
the trenches to put horror behind them. The worst
effect, as always, was on the young. It became
"smart" to carry a flask and carouse till morning.
One blood bath was not enough. We had not yet
learned the lesson that no people can flout God
with impunity. The youth of the world had to be
saved while they were yet young enough to be
rescued from the atheistic training to which they
were being subjected. Death has become the salva
tion of many young men. The teachers beyond the
veil will insofar as the receptivity of their pupils
permits undo at least some of the crimes per
petrated against the innocent in the name of so-
called progress.
What of our own flesh and blood, our bravest
and best, the flower of our land ? Will they emerge

seen. Of the help given those who cross the border
we have no doubt. But what sort of America will
await those who return? Wounded bodies, suffer
ing hearts and minds, broken hopes —what of
them?
Of course, in the final analysis, each human
being must perforce work out his own salvation.
Each must climb his own rocky precipice and de
scend into his own valley of the shadow. Even so,
that does not preclude a helping hand when the
going is rough, a light of guidance when the path
is dark. Is it to be another case of the blind lead
ing the blind until both fall over the cliff?
Our boys in the jungles, the deserts, the moun
tains, the islands, the air and the sea—our blood
sacrifices in the four corners of the earth —call
out to us. What will our answer be ? To what sort
of America will they return?
In the deepest night of human agony, from
Gethsemane to the present, one course and one
only avails —prayer and faith. The God within and
without can do far more for us than we can ask
or think. He needs, however, our recognition of the
fact. He may knock at the door but we must open.
He may speak but our hearts must hear. It takes
two to give and to receive.
In the hour of danger we instinctively turn to
prayer, even the most hard-boiled of us. What is
going to happen when this immediate fear of
physical destruction has passed and the slower
and more subtle peril of moral deterioration

and sincere enough, when we have earned the
right, a great leader will come again. Will the wise
men see his star? Will the shepherds on the hills
hear the angelic choirs? Shall we be ready to un
derstand his message and to follow?
In spite of all our mistakes the Republic still
has a chance to survive. The time of testing will
not end with the close of this war and the return
of those who still remain to continue the struggle
on the physical plane. Struggle there will be, fierce
and desperate. We must always remember, how
ever, that the Divine Purpose will prevail in spite
of the sins of humanity.
Since the need is so desperate we should use
every way possible to meet it. The supreme con
viction that should inspire every American from
this point on is the sure faith that under God we
cannot fail.

Our Place in the Plan
A S a teacher outlines the work of his class for
**• the day, week, month and term, as the busi
ness man takes inventory of his stock and looks to
the needs of the coming year, as the physician
diagnoses the causes of illness and studies the
remedies for their cure, as wise parents give their
children the training which is to equip them for
the future—just so should we, as Americans, look
at our country, realize its place in the scheme of
things and proceed under God to make that place
secure. We dare not fail in this glorious destiny.
Too many have made the supreme sacrifice. Life
may seem cheap but we have been told that not
a sparrow falls to earth unnoticed.
Wherein have we erred that so many had to fall
before their time? Some of these causes have al
ready been made clear. Others remain to be
brought to light.
It has become the fashion to scoff at the past.
Books have been written to throw mud at our
national heroes. We have even sidetracked the
teaching of American history. Next in line for the
mud-slingers have been the founders of our vast
fortunes. Granted that some of them became un
scrupulous, the fact remains that they helped open

meet with ridicule: the stiff-necked Puritans,
chaperones, family prayer, church-going, Sunday
school, the good old horse and buggy —anachro
nisms all, in the whirling jazz of the present. All
the past, good and bad, must be thrown into the
discard and the so-called new used for wild and
reckless experimentation. We forget that there is
nothing new under the sun. We ignore the fact
that much of this so-called new has been tried
before and miserably failed.
Even so we are not shutting our eyes to prog
ress. We do not mean worship of the past to the
point of stagnation. There must be growth or the
organism dies. Study Nature and her way of
working. Continuous growth and development, the
new oak rising from the acorn of the old. Orderly
progress, steady evolution! The past cannot be
separated from the present, or the present from
the future. All are one in the Eternal Now.
When this country has fulfilled its purpose it
will decline and give way to a new off-shoot. That
time has not yet come. If it is forced, the ruin
will be absolute.
At the moment the condition seems most hope
less, the change is near. Nothing is static. There
must be recovery or a complete change of condi
tion. The time is fast approaching when such a
crisis will arise. We must be ready. "Forewarned
is forearmed."

them. Will there be triumphant marches up the

avenues of our great cities? Will flags fly, bands
play, confetti fall in clouds, sidewalks and win
dows be packed with wildly applauding spectators ?
Will a veritable hysteria of joy sweep the nation?
After the ball, what then ? The search for work,
the growing conviction that medals are baubles,
the inability to pick up sundered relationships,
bitterness, disillusion, despair! Is this too dark a
picture? It happened after the last war to many.
If our boys do find their souls in the face of death,
they will solve their own individual problems in
due course. We hope there will be many such. We
hope triumphant faith and courage will survive
in the light of common day when the bands have
ceased to play and there is no longer need to wade
through jungles, man bombers, dodge oncoming
shot and shell. The excitement of thrilling adven
ture, if war is ever thrilling, the loss of the per
sonal self in the supreme need of the fighting unit
—all these will be gone. The humdrum life of com
mon day begins again. How can we help our men

rode safe in the ark; Daniel escaped death in tne
lions' den; Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego
emerged unscathed from the fiery furnace; Peter
followed the angel out of prison, unseen and un
harmed. Triumphant faith led them all the way.
We cannot all at once raise ourselves to this
exalted consciousness. We can, however, begin, for
"Now is the accepted time." If we are to be ready
for our fighting men when they return, if we are
to help them in the years ahead, we must start
now to acquaint ourselves with our own hidden
power. Daily communion with the Highest we
know will give us inspiration and guidance under
God to see our place in the work ahead that we
may equip ourselves to fill it.

The Return to Sanity
TTOW can this be done? We have gone so far
into the bypaths of dense materialism that
some will find the rest of this book as fantastic
as Shangri-La. Will it be possible for us to have
once more the faith of a little child that we may
find our lost way into the kingdom of heaven? A
chosen few have done so, more than the world
knows, but most who have had the glimpse have
lost and forgotten it or have labeled the rare mo
ment of higher consciousness a fleeting dream.
The steps are definite and clear. You can find
them all in the teachings of the mystics. Suppose
we begin with a few old, old sayings: "Ye cannot
serve God and mammon." "Where your treasure
is there will your heart be also." "Seek ye first
the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all
these things will be added unto you."
Many movements of comparatively recent years
have emphasized the power of thought : Christian
Science, Mental Science, New Thought. They have
done much good in their emphasis on man as a
spiritual being. They have driven home the reali
zation that as we think, so we are, that thoughts
are things, that all begins with thought, which
sooner or later finds material expression. There is
nothing new in this philosophy. Plato taught it;

think only those thoughts which are true, honest,
just, pure, lovely, and of good report. Why? Be
cause we attract to ourselves the conditions that
our thought creates.
The danger, as we see it, in some of these move
ments is the concentration on personal advantage,
regardless of the other fellow. If our politicians
had not through the years thought first and fore
most of themselves, we should not now be in the
chaotic mess in which we find ourselves. Words,
words, words —safe behind the lines—while the
mangled bodies and ruined lives of our young cry
like the blood of Abel from the earth for
vengeance.
"Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the
Lord."
"It is impossible but that offenses will come:
but woe unto him through whom they come!"
Woe if not in this world, certainly in the next!
We don't like to think about the next world. Many
people today believe there is no life but this, here
and now. Every man to his own taste, but some
day bitter indeed will be the awakening. Evil to
be made good, opportunities lost to be sought again
in nerve-wracking effort, the gaps in the pattern
to be filled and the torn places rewoven. Time lost,
needless agony!

what can we do for the Republic of the United

We must think of her as restored to her pris

the grace of God under wise leaders who live only
to serve the Divine purpose. We must never lose
the vision that such leaders will come when the
time is ripe.
First and foremost, however, we must take stock
of ourselves. Where do we stand? "Choose you this

the same choice. It will in the end make no differ
ence in the final outcome of the fate of our Re
public, but it will make a vital difference in the
fate of those who choose.

then our greatest need? A high standard of mo

not be repeated. We started out badly in this war.
Young girls roaming the streets, homes broken in
the total lack of parental care, wholly mistaken
ideas in immature minds who have no knowledge
of what life is all about. It is always bitter when
tragic experience takes the place of wise counsel.
We do not have to stick our fingers into the fire
to know fire burns. The experience of the race
should count for something; the fruit of all that
experience is embodied in the moral law. The
young today in too many instances scorn the past,
scorn their elders. Can we blame them?
Look again at the influences to which we have
subjected our children, for children many of them
are, young souls in dire need of wise guidance.
Look at the stage, the screen, current novels, jazz
music, questionable songs, —yes, the whole sorry

The one ray of hope in this miserable situation
is the inherent good sense and inborn decency of
many of our young. But we must guard against
disillusionment and despair when our boys return.
Women were given the vote in the high hope
that they would help make a better world. Is it not
time that mothers, wives, sisters, daughters took
stock of themselves and their obligations? Many
fine women have borne heavy burdens all their
lives. There are always the few who are the salt
of the earth. The time is coming, however, when
the few must become the many if the race is to
survive. We do not mean to paint too dark a pic
ture but we must face the future equipped to
meet it.
We have had crises before. We have come
through them with varying degrees of success.
Unhappily the days ahead find us ill-prepared. We
have gone so far away from spiritual fundamen
tals. Let us examine again some of these funda
mentals. We have spoken of man the spiritual be
ing as a concept lost by many who wander in the

need of high standards of morality. It is only by
the practice of the highest we know that we can
evolve toward new concepts and still more lofty

fering, it is only the part of common sense to open
our minds to new visions of truth and begin to
prepare for the climb ahead.
In his "Farewell Address" Washington stresses
the need of religion and morality. Too many have
thrown these concepts into the discard. Every
thing old is taboo. Merrily onward we must go in
rash experimentation, the blind leading the blind.
The world cannot throw God overboard. Look
at us today, headed for dictatorship. The right
kind of dictator might be our temporary salvation
in the chaos ahead. The wrong kind will set us
back scores of years.
Since the need is so great, former leaders of our
country now in the Beyond are in close touch with
America. Abraham Lincoln still "walks at mid
night." Ulysses Grant is an unseen adviser and
inspirer in the councils of war. A host of unseen
workers, great and small, are at the helm. Highly
developed souls who have been far from the earth
atmosphere are once more near, the need is so tre
mendous. In the noble brotherhood of service each
lives only to hear the voice of the Leader and fear
lessly to obey.
It will seem fantastic to some to believe in the

the individual. Those who can raise their con
sciousness to the required rate can catch the mes
sage. Under stress of great need, where motives
are unselfishly for the good of the whole, miracles
can and do occur.
There is exhilaration in this knowledge. The
Unseen radiates its wisdom and power. We have
only to put ourselves in a state of receptivity by
keeping the channel clear and catching the inspira
tion. Such a time is now with us. We are never
alone in peril. There is still the pillar of cloud by
day and the pillar of fire by night. In fact the
activity behind the scenes is even more intense
than the storming of a bridgehead or the repulse

if we know how to sound the trumpet. Don't for
get Washington at Valley Forge. Don't forget Lin

forget the turning of the tide at the Marne.
Do you see, then, the absolute necessity in the
days ahead of God-fearing leaders in all fields of
activity? The time has passed for experimentation.
We need as never before a man of God, true to the

The Enemy Within

within our own household — rats, termites,
vermin, seeking to destroy in darkness. National
complacency has ever been a characteristic of this
country. Our life in recent decades has been so
easy. All that has seemed necessary is sufficient
money to sit on a cushion and eat strawberries
and cream. Meanwhile, far underneath the struc
ture of our government, hidden in education, rec
reation, fashion — in short, all departments of our
national and personal existence — the destroyers
have been and are at work.
Many servicemen today say they have no illu
sions about this war. Another will come in thirty
years. With such a philosophy what can save us?
We do not blame the young who have lost their
dreams. When youth becomes disillusioned, what
is there ahead?
How vital it is to reconstruct our whole scheme
of things ! Pessimism never got anyone anywhere.
We must "see life steadily and see it whole." That
means an immediate return to personal and to
national integrity. Look around you and study the
forces at work. Can you read between the lines?
Can you glimpse the handwriting on the wall?
Can you sit idly by and let everything you hold

ting on the sidelines has long since passed. "Choose
you this day whom ye will serve." Is it to be
Christ or anti-Christ? We put this up to the people
of America. Pussy-foot if you dare —and lose your
Republic.
Once upon a time we had visions and dreamed
dreams. Once upon a time hope sang in our hearts
as we turned our faces Westward. Now even the
young walk bewildered, bitter, with no future but
untimely death and worse!
Are you going to let our country remain a play
ground for the forces of Evil? They are hard at
work, making hay while the sun shines. They
never had a better chance than now. They revelled
in Atlantis, they had their fling in Sodom and
Gomorrah, they inspired Nero as Rome burned,
they have ever ridden the thunderbolts of war
when all the devils are let loose, for war is hell,
their native element.
One small hand in the dikes saved Holland. One
fearless soldier has rescued many a lost cause. The
psychological moment awaits a God-inspired soul
and the day is won.
It may seem unnecessary to you to make such

lowering of moral standards. Corruption in public
office is flagrant. You will say this has always been
true. Has it? We hear a great deal today about
freedoms. How much freedom of speech do we
really have? How much freedom of the press?
Under the guise of a war emergency we have been
classified and rationed to the nth degree. Has this
been necessary? Some years ago we killed all the
little pigs. The bright boys in the seats of the
mighty tried to dictate to the Lord about the lamb
ing season. They had less success with Him than
they have had with us. We have been herded like
cattle, bullied and browbeaten, and we haven't had
sense enough to see what was happening right
under our noses.
When the war emergency is over, what then?
Do we propose to let our country remain saddled
with unseen but nonetheless real dictatorship?
The discarded Constitution will have to be rescued
from the dustnheap and restored to its old place
of dignity and honor in our national life. Along
with the Constitution must be found the original
Bill of Rights. A third volume on the shelf of re
quired reading and practice is the Holy Bible. A
thorough house-cleaning is necessary from attic
to cellar. Domestic problems will be indeed serious
in many homes. National problems will require the
cleaning of the Augaean stables.
After we have set our own house in order we
can "rescue" the rest of the world. But any house
keeper knows that her own work is never done.

Somewhere along the line will be those who will

will illumine even the darkest shadows of willful

This illumination cannot come all at once. Prog

in and above where shines the great Spiritual Sun.
Then in the radiation of its perfect beauty we can

expression in our lives as individuals and as a
nation.

they left off here. In those higher realms where
the law of service is the order of the day, constant
progress for the race evolves. We cannot remain
God's country unless we choose leaders in tune
with these higher forces.
We have made such a slogan of freedom of re
ligion that it has become apparently broad-minded
to have no religion at all. Our public men should
be statesmen, not politicians. A true statesman
like all inspired workers knows that of himself he
can do nothing. If he is a true instrument, he
straightway becomes the man of the hour. This
spiritual inflow should be the heart's desire of
every citizen of the Republic. Under such inspira
tion and guidance nothing can go wrong. If "of
fenses must come," we shall have the wisdom to
meet them as the Ship of State proceeds in safety
to sail the seas of Time.
Let us recapitulate the points thus far made:
God has a plan for this country; we are his co
workers in the carrying out of this plan; as co
workers we must begin to prepare the way for
great changes ahead. This involves a thorough
house-cleaning, first of ourselves so that we can
set the house of our own life in order, second of
our citizenry and the leaders to whom we entrust
our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor. We
have allowed our young to become the pawn of
wicked men once too often. Where are you, O

who hide their real purposes under high-sounding

be exposed to vile pictures, vile plays, vile books.
You have let them be turned into cannon fodder
on foreign fields. You have sat on the sidelines in
dazed stupor. You have even forgotten your
prayers or this holocaust could never have hap

Great wrongs remain to be righted. We can no
longer go through life with blinkers on. If we are
not to be completely overwhelmed in the fast ap
proaching crisis we must begin now to take our
place in the band of workers so sorely needed in
the days ahead. How shall we find our place ? Leave
that to God. Prayer and the readiness to follow

walk, and holding fast to the hand of Divine Love
try again and again until our spiritual muscles be

Our Accountability
TWTAKE no mistake about this. We shall be held
accountable for the way we use the light we
have. Each has his own mission which no other
can fill quite so well. God makes individuals, not
masses. We are not products of a factory. Each,
though, is a cog in the whole, a link in the chain.
It is a truism that a chain is only as strong as its
weakest link.
"Where do we go from here, boys?" How often
in our personal lives have we heard that refrain.
We all have times when we wait at the crossroads,
not knowing which way to turn. "He leadeth me"
is our one assurance. When we insist on having
our own mistaken way, we head for the swamp
lands, to be swallowed in the bogs of our own
making.
This tie with the Spiritual Sun within is vitally
important. Only so can inspiration guide us. Only
so can the right path open. The early apostles
proved that. The disciples made their journeys
with empty purses but illumined hearts. The way
always opens to God-centered men. Only so can
we save ourselves and our Republic. The means
will be shown the moment we call on our Divine
Leader. Miracles still occur. We say they are
miracles because we do not yet know the higher

our Spiritual Center, set the right cause going,
and the right effect will appear.
It is difficult today to make time for this re
orientation of our lives. We all on occasion find it
difficult to go to sleep. We all have periods of
wakefulness. We all have forced moments of physi
cal inactivity on trains and buses, streetcars and
autos. The mind has to dwell on something —too
often on nagging worries. Put in their place a fa
vorite psalm, an inspiring poem, a radiant affirma

Must we be at the point of physical death before
we are ready to turn to our Divine Source? We
should be in complete harmony with that Source

When the world was young, God walked in the

own until sin came and they hid from sight. How
far distant seems that idyllic age! Yet it can be
with us, within, even in the storm of war, the
thunder of bombs, the roar of mighty guns, the
whirlwinds of hate. It can be with us in the diffi
cult days of reconstruction ahead. It can point the
way ; it can heal and build. We have only to open
the garden gate, believing, and we shall receive.
The absorbing interest today is money. In it
self as an instrument of good, a medium of ex
change, it is necessary in the material world. The
sin is one of mistaken emphasis. We make the
means the end and lose sight of relative values.

GOD'S COUNTRY
When we cross the portal into the next world we
take only ourselves. Money stays behind to be
fought over by relatives. In the finer ethers we
are told the power of thought is so great that an
effort of will creates the object needed. So much
the more reason for control of thought lest we
create the thing we do not want. Fear, for in
stance, has that very effect even on the material
plane. We concentrate so deeply through fear on
conditions we dread that we bring those very con
ditions into our lives.
We must have money on this plane —yes—but
not as the whole object of our existence. If we put
ourselves right with higher forces, making the
development of the Higher Self the sole aim in this
life, we shall find what we must have for our daily
needs coming our way as the inevitable effect of
the cause we have set in motion. New avenues of
inspiration will open for us, wherein we can walk
at peace in the realization of constant supply. Fear
and the ignorance that gives rise to fear are the
bogey-men of most people's existence.
We stress money at this point because in the
years ahead it will become increasingly necessary
to set ourselves right on this subject of creative
thought. We shall need many new avenues of ex
pression in all fields of human activity. Creative
imagination, whereby we enter the channel of
creative expression, will open many new lines for
the welfare of humanity. These are ready now on
higher planes, waiting for the inspired workers

here to transmit them into material expression.
We must dwell on the concept of ourselves as
channels whereby God can work. Rare is the privi
lege and happy the one who can see visions and
dream dreams with such force and power that
through the working of law the ethereal becomes
the material, the thought the fact, and a more
beautiful world evolves.
In a sense God's Country is the world —the uni
verse. We shall come to that idea later on. For the
present we are concentrating on the Republic, our
duty to it in the trying days ahead, and our duty
to ourselves to develop our powers to such a point
that we can use them constructively for the good
of all.

Difficulties, Always Opportunities
"TVlFFTCULTIES are always opportunities in dis-
guise. The wise man meets the situation that
confronts him, knowing that it is the next step
in his upward progress. It may seem retrogression
but that is due to our limited vision. If we could
see the ultimate end and realize that we are wip-i
ing the slate of experience free from old debts,
we should rejoice that we are being given the
chance to undo past mistakes and clear our path
for further progress. We have to pay our debts and
keep our credit balanced. In no field is this so vital
and so inescapable as in the field of the moral law.
We go forward, then, in the conviction that our
ultimate goal is upward, that we have not failed
in the final analysis. Apparent failures and the
suffering resultant therefrom only make us open
our eyes to causes and spur us on to better living.
In this we grow strong as tested muscles respond
to tested wills. We must never doubt our own in
herent power to overcome our difficulties and move
onward. The only failure is loss of faith and hope.
As we have tried to show so often, the star still
shines behind the cloud. God is still in His heaven.
If all is not right with the world, it is because
humanity has gone far afield in ignorance of its
own inherent divinity.

GOD'S COUNTRY
We have to play the game whatever the cost to
the personal self. Our servicemen are learning
this and proving it gloriously. Our part may be a
humble one but it is as important as any on the
field. There is no great or small in the scales of
eternal justice. We have a job to do. However
small it may seem to be, it is ours to do it well.
Everything is relative. To the man who cleans
the sewers, the man who sweeps the streets is a
minor deity. If we could do this or that, we say, if
we had the talent, the looks, the charm, the money,
the position, we could succeed, too, and find our
selves in a seventh heaven of delight. If—if—if!
We must take the part assigned in the human
comedy and play it to the best of our ability. We
may be sure we shall have a more important role
as we work unselfishly and devotedly for the Great
Dramatist behind the scenes.
By losing ourselves in this center of Power and
Perfection we express more and more the will of
the Creator. We learn that of ourselves we can do
nothing. Personal pride is laid on the altar in
clouds of purest incense as we strive on and on to
become tested channels for the One in whom we
live and move and have our being. With such a
realization we cannot fail in our appointed task.
We go our way in the serene assurance that under
God we must succeed. This is a matter of growth
and experience, but once we see the vision we must
follow. Nothing else matters in this world or the
next.

GOD'S COUNTRY
Let us look at the world today. A pitiful spec
tacle of ruin and desolation! Buildings that took
years to construct, priceless works of art that can
never be replaced—all gone! Homes demolished,
simple household treasures cherished through the
years forever lost! Manpower wasted that might
have gone into constructive channels for the up
building of humanity ! Hearts broken, lives ruined !
We put all this under high-sounding slogans.
We must save the world for democracy. We must
preserve the five freedoms, or the six, or the
seven. High-sounding hypocrites that we are. Try
to go against the four horsemen and see how much
freedom you have. There is always the liberation
of death, but only a coward takes his own life.
Brave men and women suffer through, seeking
with all the intelligence at their command the
right avenue of escape into better conditions.
We gain nothing by deceiving ourselves. Some
where along the line we are brought face to face
with truth, bitter though it may be. We see our
selves for what we are. Fortunately we can also
have the vision of what we intend to be.
If only a few would band together to stop all
war, it would be a glorious mission. We need Don
Quixotes today. A little leaven lightens the lump.
A small spark may start a conflagration. Mothers
who have held their children in their arms and
dreamed long dreams of the future of their sons
should be the logical nucleus of a movement that
would sweep the earth. Such tragic destruction,

such blasphemy against Divine Law! We know
life can be more bitter than death. However that
may be, it is our job to face a future of conserva
tion, preservation. The willful waste of war sets
back the whole world. Balance so-called gain, if
you can find it, against only too apparent loss.
Where do we stand in the end? Hopelessly de
feated !
The other side suffers as well. Driven on by
forces over which they have no control, they must
kill or be killed. "Theirs not to reason why, theirs
but to do and die." Of course we all eventually ride
into the valley of death, we hope with colors fly
ing. But what right has any government to sacri
fice its young in the name of democracy or any
other high-sounding slogan? If we saw to it that
our leaders were committed to the policy of "live .
and let live," our sons would have their chance
and our sons' sons. As it is, we are following the
road of self -extermination.
If the material plane did not need us and we it,
we should not be here. The law of growth puts
each in his place. The way he fills his place de
termines his next step. A Chinese puzzle is simple
as compared to the picture today. We build only
to destroy. Years of planning, of constructive ef
fort go for nothing in a senseless orgy of organized
havoc. It is enough to make the high gods wash
their hands of the sorry mess, and leave us to our
own insanity.

from preconceived notions. Voices still cry in
the wilderness of mistaken ideas. The encouraging
thing is that "one with God is a majority." Why
not try it and see ? A whole panorama of thrilling
achievement unfolds before the eyes of the man
who dares work with this conviction in his heart.
We can still lift up our eyes to the hills, from
whence cometh our help. We can still study the
orderly movements of the stars and with a little
imagination hear their celestial harmony. We can
still walk with Nature in the orderly progress of
the seasons, the beauty of dawn and sunset, the
riotous colors of gardens and plains, the majestic
sweep of prairies, mountains, pines, and sea. The
ability to lose one's soul in beauty opens the con
sciousness to that universe where finer vibrations
permit keener realization of truth.
We must lose ourselves to find Ourselves, lose
the conception that we are weak and limited,
pawns for forces over which we have no control.
After all, death is the greatest bugbear in the
lives of most people. We make such an unneces
sary horror of that universal experience. It is, in
truth, "the greatest adventure that life offers."

venture, what is there to dread? Nothing, except
the consequences of our own mistaken, ignorance !
Fortunately we are not rushed in our evolution
until we are ready to take it. Most of us have to
grow slowly. We learn a step at a time, especially
when we are young and weak. Such must be pro
tected until they are able to bear the buffets, the
slings and arrows. In reality such harsh treatment
is our greatest good. The gold must be refined in
the furnace until no dross remains. The pure gold
of Spirit, lustrous beyond compare! For this we
chose the torment called life. Not until we have
been tested, tried, and purified as by fire can we
reach our goal. The quivering lute of the soul must
catch the celestial harmony before it can become
attuned to the mighty orchestra of creation.
The wheel turns as the water rushes under it
and out to sea. There is no going back. Familiar
landmarks are left behind. Loved faces disappear
into the mist which we try so earnestly to pene
trate. Some day we, too, shall follow. While we
are here, however, we must meet situations as
they arise, knowing that the current of our Fate
carries us ever onward to the mighty ocean.
If that passing is to be serene and tranquil in
the golden sunset of unshaken Faith, we must
here and now analyze the real purpose of life and
our place therein. If we could, many of us would
fight our way through to a retreat, hidden high
in mountain passes, where we might escape the
turmoil of the dusty plains. Most of us find this

impossible. We have been placed in the thick of
the fight and there we must remain. "A safe lodg
ing and a night's repose" can come only when our
work is done.
However disillusioned and heartbroken we may
be, we must press on to the knowledge of our real
Self. It has played many parts in the drama of
life, probably identifying itself with each. No
wonder it is weary unto death. It needs to learn
that each part is only a temporary expression,
that the Soul remains aloof, a spectator in the
scheme of things. We pick ourselves up and go on,
regardless of "the bludgeoning of chance." If we
are wise we do not weep. The adventure will be
glorious in spite of the odds. Thus we grow into
heroic stature as Fate continues to test us while
the Wheel of the Law revolves.

is high time that we turned right about face.
The years pass so rapidly; the agony of mis-f
taken effort is so great. New occasions demand
new viewpoints as well as new duties. With the
correct point of view we can fulfill our obligation
to ourselves and to our country as never before.
Our range of view depends upon our position. If
we are too close to a situation we lose our perspec
tive. We must be far enough away to see the whole
panorama and our place in it. Without field glasses
we lose ourselves in unimportant details and take
the part for the whole. Points of view are so rela
tive and so changing. There must be a fixed course,
a definite aim, a sifting of the vital from the trivial
as we concentrate on one purpose, the purpose for
which we took our place in the scheme of things
at this appointed time and in this appointed coun
try. Such a concept dignifies all life.
What a tragedy to lose our place in the plan!
Even if we go down, it matters not if we have kept
true to our trust. Even if we drop exhausted and
dying at the wayside, we can know we have done
our best in the heart-breaking effort of the van
guard, struggling on and on against terrific odds.

welcome us unless we have earned the right to a
respite from the struggle. Otherwise we face the
bad effects of our own making which must be un
done in God's good time before any peace or prog
ress is possible.
How much wiser to determine now what is the
goal of most importance! If it is the wrong goal,
the whole sorry scheme of our life must be recog
nized and atonement made. Fortunes founded on
blood and tears, grime and sweat, destruction and
violence —of what good are they to the man who
bent every nerve toward amassing millions on the
torn bodies of his brothers? Not only does he
leave his accursed gold behind, but in agony he
must rebuild as best he can the ruin he has
caused.
It is only common sense to choose lasting values,
values that go with us into the Beyond, built into
character. These are our only permanent posses
sions. Meanwhile, even in the valley of the shadow
of Death, we have no fear. We have known the
green pastures and the still waters. We have full
assurance of the rod and the staff of our Heavenly
Guide.
We must test relative values here and now. We

the link with our Higher Self. No might, no power
can avail against omnipotent Spirit. Yet we are
free in that we have the right to choose. We can
listen or not, just as we wish. We can go or come,
following our own short-sighted plans, or we can
wait on bended knees for the higher command
which inevitably comes when the servant of the
Most High has opened the channels of his being
and is ready to hear.
In the long night watches higher forces, work

the lights below. When a sensitive soul stands il
lumined to their penetrating search, they know
he is ready to become an instrument for good and
he is given his chance. The light illumines his way,

how or why certain avenues open. He recognizes
only an impelling force directing every move. A
new harmony pervades his being as he works in
accordance with the Divine Will. Old worries drop
away, old fears, old griefs. Serene and confident,
he takes his appointed place and knows that all is
well.
This experience can be the lot of every one of
us. We all can be the child Samuel, chosen for a
great destiny, not necessarily great in the eyes of

vision of hope as night turns to dawn and dark

ever so long that morning did not come at its ap

Even a friend will give his life for his friend. Pain
and apparent loss amount to less than nothing
when weighed against a glorious goal.
To those who understand the Divine Plan in the
upheavals that befall the race and the individual,
there is an exhilaration in buffeting the waves and
riding high on the breakers. Fear does not enter
the picture, for the end is known even before the
event occurs. Few of us have such prevision but
faith can take its place. No great accomplishments
are ever possible without faith. We see and know,

falls to refresh the earth, to quicken life
and bring it to an expression of beauty. With
out dark clouds man could not live. He must have
food for his sustenance. He must have beauty even
more, though he may not know it. His soul may
starve when he thinks he is most fortunate as
money jingles in his pockets and a thick bankroll
lies next to his heart. Rain has become symbolic
of trouble, of dark and dreary days which we must
endure because we have no choice. What a fallacy!
Rain soothes and heals. It makes possible new life.
It refreshes life already on its way. The great up
ward surge of Nature responds to the showers of
blessing and opens its chalice to catch the life-
giving flow.
Inspiration is akin to rain. It touches arid
stretches of on-rolling plains of objectivity. It
wafts the incense from higher reaches of the Soul.
There is a balance of giving and receiving, the
cup taking according to its receptivity. Without
this giving and receiving, human life like a plant
would wither and die in the desert of materialism.
Even when we take the old analogy of rain and
tears we find the same truth. Without tears hearts
become stony. No Divine compassion brings them
to fruition. They cannot carry their share of the

sorrow of humanity unless they, too, have known
sorrow. Tears like rain bring the whole being to
full blossom and make it express a beauty im
possible unless it has become acquainted with
grief.
Perhaps this is one reason that the race as well
as individuals must have moments in Gethsemane.
Tears like rain make possible the incense which
ascends in gratitude to the altars of the Most
High. We take tears like rain because we have no
choice. It is only after the flood has passed over
our heads and we arise to greet the sun that we
see the purpose of the agony and build in a
stronger foundation, secure against the storms,
which can no longer dash our house against the
rocks or carry us helpless out to sea.
Tears and rain, rain and tears! Eventually a
rainbow spans the sky, and we have the promise
of fair weather.
Even in God's country of the Republic, as in
God's country of the soul, must come rain and
tears as the race writhes in agony. We have only
to remember in the darkness that "Time and the
hour runs through the roughest day." All things
pass—except the Word of God. We move on to
our appointed destiny as a country and as indi
viduals. We choose that destiny by our own ac
tions. If we work with God, we have a vision of
hope for the tomorrows, knowing that night dis
appears in day, and tears become a rainbow of
beauty to the eyes of soul.

What Is Prayer?
NO
extreme measures accomplish spiritual de
velopment, no long fasting, no exercises of
abnormal breathing, no hitching oneself up by
one's bootstraps! Prayer and faith are the two
essentials. By prayer we mean meditation on
Divine truth until the whole being responds and
no lower vibration can find entrance.
Picture yourself enveloped in quivering colors.
They may have all the beauty of flowers in Spring,
of sunsets and sunrises. Or they may be dark,
dull and forbidding like a fortress through which
no sun can shine. Into such a dungeon little light
will come, no rainbow prisms. The soul starves
and eventually becomes a prisoner for life in a
tomb of its own making. But the radiant one who
breathes with the morning, his windows wide open
to let in the sun, knows no such limitations. He
recognizes truth in beauty and beauty in truth.
He expands his evergrowing consciousness to
wider horizons, greater vistas. He knows the joy
of growth, of receiving and giving. His cup over
flows as he dwells in the house of his Lord forever.
This is a time when the world is returning to
prayer. Trouble, sorrow always bring us to our
knees. But after the immediate emergency is over,
what then? We may again cut ourselves off from

our Source and resume an aimless existence. If
that happens, we arrive nowhere. The point we are
trying to make is that every breath should be a
prayer, —a prayer of faith, a prayer of thanks
giving for what we are about to receive long be
fore it comes, a prayer of blessing on all that lives,
a prayer of aspiration that we may reach higher
levels of consciousness and keep open the mar
velous channels whereby God can touch our souls
and lift us nearer to the Divine Presence.
In all this, there is time for daily duties, which
we can do better than ever before because we have
put them in the place where they belong. We have
heard of the lilies of the field. We can grow as do
they if we lift our faces to the Spiritual Sun. This
is no fantastic symbolism. This is truth given us
by the greatest of teachers, who had proved by
His own experience everything He taught. He tells
us that we can do even greater things. Such an
accomplishment is far away, perhaps, but we can
at least begin to make our life plan one of attune-
ment, conscious attunement to the highest we
know. In that way every breath becomes a prayer
of aspiration, every thought a hymn of faith.
Reach out into the sunshine and become one with
the harmony of color in which works the great
Artist and Master Builder.

The Secret of Vibration
SO
great is the need today that unusual ways
are being found to reach the hearts and minds
of men. There will be stories after this war, as
there were in the other conflict twenty odd years
ago, of miraculous escapes, strange visions, direct
answer to prayer in time of utmost need. The
worlds merge in unity when suffering and sorrow
thin the veil. The dying often have prevision of
events to come and see those who are invisible to
us. This thinning veil makes possible communica
tion which would otherwise be difficult. When hu
manity is not receptive, no contact can be made.
When in extremes we call for help, we automatic
ally attune ourselves by the realization that help
is there. Then a response can come just as in the
case of a radio tuned to receive a certain wave
length.
The pity of it is that we wait for some dire
need to make us receptive. We lose so much of
inspiration and of strength. We make our lives so
humdrum when they could have the serenity and
consecration of a cathedral. This inflow of inspira
tion could be a constant source of strength and
guidance if we would only believe in it and try
it out.

these lofty influences. By our mistaken beliefs
and our emphasis on unimportant goals we lose
sight of the real purpose of living. We rob our
selves of our birthright and become enmeshed in
sorrows of our own making. The burden of Atlas
need not be ours. We can be as free as the morn
ing, as radiant as the sunshine if we will it so. It
is all a question of vibration, the musical note to
which we can attune our being. There is "har
mony in immortal souls." Most of us cannot hear
it, not even in ourselves. Only in rare moments
does the note sound as it responds to the force
that plays upon it. These infrequent occurrences
could become continuous music if we could only
keep the vibration and harmonize our own chord
with the Master chorus. The symphony of Crea
tion is incomplete until each part is in its place.
It matters not if we are harp or violin, bass drum
or horn, we are necessary to the whole. But a
muted instrument, or worse still, an instrument
out of tune is useless. It must be set aside until
it can be made right. Meanwhile our place is un
filled; no one else can take it. How long must we
keep the Master Musician waiting?
All the arts have their peculiar spiritual links
which interblend in perfect harmony. Sound has
color, color sound. The word with its sound and
color builds or destroys, shatters or makes whole.
The entire scheme of the universe rests on har

and of his little world.
We all love beauty, even the most hardened of
us. We thrill to music, to color, to kindness un
expectedly shown, to appreciation when we have
done our best. We crave friends, sympathy, com
panionship, understanding love. We cannot be iso
lated mariners, "alone on a wide, wide sea." We
belong to the group, the team, the orchestra, the
play, the social unit in which we find ourselves.
In short, we are one in a glorious unity of man
and God.
Not until we find our spiritual note, our unique
place, the work for which we came, shall we have
peace. It is all ours for the asking when we can
attune ourselves to the inner voice. The serenity
of a mountain sunset can be ours, the majesty of
organ music. We have only to lift up our hearts
in prayer and thanksgiving as we move in har
mony with our Divine Source.

The Joy of Creation
"TT7HEN earth's last picture is painted" we
» » shall rest, and "faith, we shall need it."
Eventually, however, "the Master of all good work
men will set us to work anew." Ceaseless activity
is the law, constant service, not for ourselves but
for the Power Who knows the plan and the part
for which each of us is fitted. "All for one, and one
for all." It is a glorious conception that God's
country depends on us for its full development.
How futile to question, how suicidal to insist on
our own mistaken way ! We can see only so much
at a time; we can do only so much in a day. We
follow the plan of the all-wise Architect who en
visions the finished structure even before its
foundations have been laid. We can work as day-
laborers, or as artists, absorbed in the joy of
creation.
"The Master of all good workmen" needs many
skills, all equally important, all equally interde
pendent. Just as the human body has many parts,
seen and unseen, each depends upon the other.
With much of this working behind the scenes man
has no part. Nature keeps the house of his physi
cal being in order, often in spite of his misuse of
it. All the processes that make us a perfectly
working mechanism automatically fulfill their

function. The only time we realize such activities
exist is at the moment when we block them by
our own carelessness. With none of this vital work
behind the scenes of our physical envelope have
we much to do. If we live harmoniously, we do
not know the existence of many of these bodily
functions. Does not this unconscious dependence
of ours on Nature to carry on for us in the mys
tery of our own bodies make a perfect analogy to
our dependence on Spiritual power within and be
yond us?
To return to the metaphor of the tapestry ! The
weaver who loses himself in petty details, forget
ful of larger issues of color and design, forfeits
time, strength and joy in his work. He cannot
create if he feels himself a drudge, dragging out
a miserable existence in meaningless toil. On the
contrary, the moment his soul catches the vision,
sees the perfected whole in all its beauty, knows
the importance of his own part in this whole, that
moment he rises to the height of power. He sees
in a flash the complete pattern ; he knows the pur
pose for which the work has been planned. Greater
vistas loom before him of still greater magnifi
cence. There in the fulness of time he, too, will
have a part, for as a good workman he has earned
the right to the promotion for which he has fitted
himself* Tested and tried, he moves on to greater
opportunities, wider responsibilities. He gravi
tates to his own particular place by the very na

The Law of Change
rpHIS is no time for despair. The exhilaration of
opportunity is in the air. Changes bring up
heaval, but with that very upheaval comes the
promise of better days. Sad memories merge into
happy expectation as they mellow with the years.
Uprooting for the time is painful ; yet worse pain
would come if the causes thereof were not re
moved. Abscesses on the body politic must be cut
and drained. Cancers in the social structure must
be removed before it is too late. Selfish short
sightedness in personal points of view must give
way to larger concepts of wider good.
Such changes are never easy. The coming to this
world, which we call birth, and the leaving, which
we call death, involve great pain. The loss of land
marks and treasures we hold dear gives us inevi
table suffering. For a time we stand helpless and
bewildered, not knowing which way to turn. Then
in the light of further knowledge we follow the
path appointed and eventually adjust ourselves to
our changing world.
God works through changes. Nothing can re
main static. Even though we may seem to be head
ing downward, we must have faith in the ultimate
upward turning of the spiral of progress. There
is no loss in the true concept of change. There

must be birth and death in individuals as in cus
toms and in countries. Who wants to stand still?
The stars move in their appointed courses; the
flowers bud, blossom and disappear; the ocean is
never still as the tides ebb and flow in rhythmical
regularity. We, too, must move with the years.
We cannot stay children forever; neither do we
want enfeebled old age forever. Grief may endure
for a night, "but joy cometh in the morning." The
one changeless center for all this constantly chang
ing activity is our Source, Whose plan it is to
evolve a more perfect creation which shall reflect
a more perfect beauty as it approximates the pat
tern designed for its full expression.
We should not be disturbed by changes. A trav
eler wishes to reach his destination. He resents
delay. He cannot wait indefinitely at the cross
roads for this or that obstruction. The end of the
journey is his objective, not the means of reaching
it. If we travel through life with some such point
of view as this, we shall save ourselves needless
suffering. We may have a happy or a difficult ex
perience. That is relatively unimportant. The des
tination should be our vital concern. We are headed
home.
We must prepare then for many upheavals and
not take them too much to heart. They may seem
for the better; they may seem for the worse. We
must breast them as a swimmer rides the waves
in the consciousness of the tremendous thrill of

struggle and the joy of being able to surmount
and overcome.
In these changes which face us all, certain fun
damental principles stand fixed, as immutable as
the laws of Nature. Spiritual truth is ever the
same. We may evolve new ideals as we grow and
gain further illumination, but the change is in us,
not in the eternal verities. Steadfast as the pole-

valleys, but move we must if we are to reach our

The Power of Love
rpHE highest vibration known to man is Love.
It is the key to the Divine in him and in the
universe, for we are told that God Himself is Love.
The nearest approach to this Divine quality is
universal compassion for all that lives. It is this
realization that opens the way to cosmic con
sciousness. All selfishness disappears in the illu
mination of the One Self in all and through all.
This experience may last only a fleeting second
but it is never forgotten. When it can be held
steadily, man has freed himself from the bonds
of earth and need not return unless he so desires.
This may seem fantastic to those who have been
trained in the belief that one earth life is all there
is or those who are convinced we go from here to
hell or to heaven. This thing called life is not a
one-way passage. It is not so simple as all that,
for we are not equipped to reach perfection at a
single bound. This is a long, continuous process.
There can be no forced growth; otherwise the
plant withers and dies. The roots must be firmly
fixed; the unfolding slow according to natural
laws.
We can quicken this growth voluntarily when
we reach a certain point. That point is the mo
ment of realization that all life is one expression.

We know at that point that if we harm another
we hurt ourselves. If one part of the body feels
pain, the whole organism suffers. It is so in the
human family. Not until we become true lovers of
mankind does our pilgrimage end. Then we need
go no more out but are made pillars in the temple
of the living God.
Buddha taught the gospel of renunciation, de
tachment; Christ brought the message of Love.
Here are two sides of the same shield. Through
Love we give up self-centeredness in the identifi
cation of ourselves with the one beloved. In the
high sense we merge our own individual interests
into the interests of humanity. The drop of water
falls into the great ocean and becomes one with
the larger whole. The individual life loses itself
in universal life and becomes one with all that
lives.
In this sense we are our brothers' keepers, for
they are one with us. When they suffer, we suffer.
When they rejoice, we rejoice. Few reach this ex
alted state. It takes many lives, lives of suffering
in the winepress of human agony until we can fol
low in the footsteps of the One Who consecrated
all suffering by His agony on the cross.
We must not think that suffering is the only
way to universal Love. Joy is far better, but
strangely enough at this point in evolution joy
seems to lead away from universality to selfish
ness. It is not so in Nature. One bird's note is the
signal for the morning chorus or the evening

another's happy play. All young creatures are
closer to the great heart of Nature. They feel
without analyzing. They love without criticism.
They trust and are not afraid. The friendliness of
a little child for the whole world is a rare and
beautiful thing. We have been told that unless we
become as little children we cannot enter the king
dom of Heaven. Love is our admission ticket.
When hate runs rampant in individuals, in fam
ilies, in races, in nations, war is the inevitable
result. A blowing clear of the poisonous miasma
can come only when swamplands are drained and
converted into bountiful fields. The poets and phil
osophers have pictured a golden age when the lion
shall lie down with the lamb, when poisonous
plants, reptiles and insects shall lose their sting,
when all ugliness shall leave the face of nature
and of humanity as this loftiest of all vibrations,
the attribute of God Himself, shall attune all dis
cordant notes through the power of universal
Love.

The Vital Need of Spiritual Knowledge
rpHE need for trained workers is becoming in-
creasingly great. For that reason spiritual
knowledge is vital at this time. Knowledge is
power. In a conflict of forces, good against evil,
the side with the greatest power has the advan
tage. In the end good must and will triumph. The
inner and outer war can and must be shortened,
however, because energy must be conserved for
the greater task ahead.
What is this all-important knowledge? The
realization of our own inherent Divinity and the
unlimited reservoir of strength and supply which
it is our privilege to tap. Great indeed are our re
sources did we but know them. We are thinking
now not only "of material aids for the accomplish
ment of spiritual aims; we mean much more the
wisdom and power which manifest as mechanical
genius, medical skill, inspiration in all the arts,
and a new vision of spiritual truth to show us the
great possibilities that lie ahead.
It is a wonderful relief to cast off burdens of
responsibility, worry, and care. We stagger under
loads too great for our weak shoulders. We fall
by the wayside in the mistaken self-hypnosis that
we must carry on alone. We need have no burdens.

God's creatures. The secret is to consider ourselves
as agents with our work planned out for us by a
Wisdom far greater than ours, which cannot fail.
The end is known from the beginning. The steps
proceed in logical order. It is our privilege to take
only one step at a time. When our consciousness
expands in a closer harmony with the Great
Planner, we shall catch glimpses of His purposes
as the pieces of the many-colored mosaic of life
fall into place and the design begins to appear.
What we want to stress is the peace and the
confidence that come when man works as an agent
instead of an executive. The responsibility auto
matically shifts to shoulders more than able to
carry it. Omnipotence, omniscience are powerful
words. Imagine what it would be like even for a
single day to know we could not fail because all
power and all knowledge are ours. This is literally
true if we make our connection with the Supreme
Source of Power and Wisdom. We have been told
this again and again. The Christ center opens the
way. But we fail to grasp the full implication of
this marvelous truth. We cling to the dust and
see not the stars.
Dignity, self-respect, calmness, assurance, peace
and strength radiate from the man who knows he
cannot fail because the Power behind him is su
preme over all difficulties, all emergencies, all
problems. No wonder this is a "peace that passeth
understanding." Picture even one day without

It was no accident that those who founded this
republic adopted the slogan, "In God we trust."
They were tapping the Source of all supply, ma

automatically the material follows. The sensitive
ethers record the pattern which later appears in
material substance. No wonder we are told to seek
Spirit first. All begins with Spirit. All ends with
Spirit. It is the one changeless Ruler of man's

him since the beginning of the world.

The Mystery That Is Man
T>EFORE we can fully understand our place in
the plan we must know the mystery of our
own make-up. We too often identify ourselves
with our physical bodies. We feel in a vague way
that we have souls, usually souls to be saved. We
do not know that we are souls, that our souls save
us. In other words, it is the physical self that
breaks connections with higher planes of expres
sion. Like the lost sheep in the parable we wander
far away from the fold. The Shepherd must needs

The complex mechanism of man's make-up di
vides itself roughly into body, soul and spirit.
When we say body, we mean of course the physical
body. There are finer vehicles interpenetrating
and extending beyond the material envelope.
These more sensitively vibrating sheaths form
our connection with more sensitively vibrating
worlds. It is vital to keep that connection if we
are to fulfill our function as instruments or chan
nels for higher forces.
We are not automatons or puppets, pulled by
strings. We are the masters of our own destiny
through the gift of free will. At a certain point,

own. Then we turn to a reliance on a Higher
Power for help and guidance. We realize this need
usually in times of trouble and great stress. War
brings people to their knees, as do death and dis
aster. This call to the Unseen for help is always
answered. The answer may not come in the way
we expect, but come it does. The moment we pray,
we contact through our invisible bodies the plane
to which they belong. The forces of that plane
rush to our assistance. We are reinforced with
spiritual strength to bear our load, to meet emer
gencies as they arise, and to act with all the wis
dom at our command.
The physical body carries on the activities
which make it possible for us to function on the
physical plane, where for a season we must live.
We have experience to gain and work to do. The
vital connection with Soul is all-important while
we are undergoing this expression. Without it we
lose the point of our pilgrimage and wander far
afield from the purpose for which we have come.
Life should be rich and beautiful. It would be if
we could only keep our connection with our higher
self, the soul, the envelope of Spirit. Too many
lose the knowledge at physical birth, which is "a
sleep and a forgetting." The "shades of the pris
on-house" close in upon us and the "clouds of
glory" fade into the light of common day. We live
in a cell of our own making, a dungeon instead of
a watch-tower.

is man comes when we are ready for it. Teachers
greet us on different levels of the steps of the
temple of learning. We have only to equip our
selves to be ready for the next step. This gradation
of wisdom and achievement is characteristic of all
levels of activity, human and spiritual. We must
have the proper credentials before we can plunge
into any work. This is especially time in the planes
of higher activity. "As above, so below." We can
not rise in those finer ethers of the Spirit until
we have the proper equipment. The wise man pre
pares himself in his chosen field. All have the
common heritage of vast realms of Spirit, from
which we came and to which we return. Our place
in them depends on ourselves, the use we have
made of the knowledge we have, the kindness we
have shown and the help we have given in our day
and age.
We cannot walk this particular path again. We
leave our mistakes to the Love that knows our
weakness. We take a high resolve to do our best
in the new occasions ahead. Above all, we put the
burden where it belongs—on that Higher Power
which leads us all the way if we will but keep the
connection clear between this plane, which we now
call home, and those spiritual levels to which we
must return, the many mansions awaiting those
pilgrims, tested and tried, who have kept the
faith.

What glad expectancy this creates in sensitive

We take most things in life on faith. We do not

We do not personally have to run the gamut of
all human emotions. We know their reality as we
see them in other people, as we read of them in
books and study them on the stage. We know many
parts in the human drama but we do not personal

in the approaching shadows of night.

If we cannot believe this, why not pretend that
it is true? Why not practice it every day until it

Even though the clock does strike, the prince

God forgive us for hugging our troubles and re

Rest in the Law
"The stars come nightly to the sky,
The tidal waves unto the sea ;
Nor time nor space nor deep nor high
Can keep my own away from me."
IHH great law of cause and effect is illustrated
by these poetic symbols. It is a law which once
set in operation must go on until the automatic
result appears. Nothing can stop its inevitability.
There is great joy in this knowledge if the causes
set in motion are good. We do not need to take a
personal hand. Nothing in our power can help or
hinder the sweep of Divine operation. We have
only to set the right cause in motion and await
patiently the result.
We see this illustrated in all departments of
human life. Kindness attracts kindness; hate re
inforces hate. Dissipation means eventual collapse.
Industry brings its peculiar reward. Hard work
alone is not enough. It must be accompanied by
faith and constructive imagination. There is no
merit in drudgery in and of itself. Without vision
we perish.
The reason for so many apparent failures is ig
norance. If we only knew the law we could work
with it. The past has many heartaches for most
people. That is life, from which there is no escape

It is a glorious hope that good must be on the
way even in times of deepest despair. Our loved
ones wait for us. No love is ever lost. If we have
missed a wonderful experience because we took
the wrong turn at the wrong time, the experience
is still ours if it belongs to us. At some future
time and place we shall find it waiting.
Study the stars and the tides for serenity and
unfailing rhythm. Each star moves in its course,
untouched by storm or cloud. Even though we
cannot see its brilliant light through fog and mist,
it shines nonetheless, steadfast and unchanged,
fulfilling the law of its own destiny. The tides
move in and out with majestic rhythm. We cannot

wait patiently for their return.
Whatever belongs to us is ours. As heirs of the

"The Unobstructed Universe"
T the moment of death, the physical body
drops like a falling leaf and the spiritual or
astral sheath rises to the plane with which it is in
sympathetic vibration. If that plane is low, the
person is called "earthbound." If he has lived in
tune with higher thoughts and aspirations, if he
has been honest and kind, he rises to a higher lev
el depending on his vibratory rate. It is always
possible for a high spirit to come down to lower
planes on missionary effort, but the opposite is not
true. No one can rise beyond the rate of his own
vibration. He must fit himself for higher levels
before he can ascend.
For this reason it is most important that we
have a correct point of view about this universal
experience known as death. Many helpers are
needed on all the planes. If we were not so un
informed on this level and so uninterested in any
thing but the material world, all this missionary
help from above would not be needed. Life here
is a school to prepare us for life beyond. Igno
rant of the aim of our existence, we flounder in
morasses of our own making.

said the first essential was to know ourselves.

main, whatever our level. For some the homeward
path is longer and more difficult than for others.
But once we have grasped the reality of the goal,
progress is swift. There are short cuts if we will
to take them. These require strenuous effort, a
complete change of viewpoint, continuously held
until our whole outlook changes. Our bodies then
become more sensitized and spiritualized. Certain
sleeping centers begin to open. The whole rate of
vibration changes. Brilliant colors flash in the
aura as the dull greys and browns disappear. It
does not need the moment of death to take us into
the higher consciousness of a wider universe. We
live in it here as our natural habitat. It goes with
us wherever we go. We slip away from earth as
easily as a balloon rises or a kite flies in the
breeze. When the moment is ready, the cord snaps
and we are free.
Many people today are forced to think of death.
Sudden, tragic passings are an inevitable effect of
the horror of war. Such passings are tragic be
cause for the most part we are ignorant and un
prepared. Our bewildered boys often do not know
they have left the physical body. It takes time and
patience for the unseen workers to make them un
derstand. Some become more quickly readjusted
than others, depending on their individual devel
opment. The work of such is invaluable when they
find their place and with all the intelligence at
their command proceed to serve as they them
selves have been served.

GOD'S COUNTRY
This orderly, continuous, unselfish activity is a
beautiful proof of the essential divinity of man.
The moment he begins to work for others with no
thought of self, that moment he has started on
the surest and safest short cut to his own develop
ment. He saves his life by losing it.
Love is in truth "the greatest of these." Medi
tation, prayer, contemplation, aspiration—all are
good. But if they end in the selfish desire to save
one's own soul and let others look out for them
selves, they lead us into the path of black magic
where our knowledge becomes a sword instead of
a shield. If we will to shorten our own evolution,
we must take all the subtle dangers into account.
These dangers are the more real because they
are hidden. Centering on our own development at
whatever cost is exceedingly dangerous. We should
receive only to give. We should consider ourselves
channels for higher forces to flow through. The
channel must be kept open by constant service.
The moment it becomes clogged it is useless.
Different levels of consciousness so beautifully
graded, each blending into the one above and
reaching in love to the one below! Rhythmic or
der, perfect planning —death only a step ahead in
to fuller life. Truly there is nothing to fear except
our own selfish ignorance.

The Presence
OFTEN
when we have difficult work ahead, we
dread it. We feel unequal to the task. We wish
we could escape from the responsibility. We grit
our teeth and go ahead with dogged determina
tion, knowing the job must be done. Or perhaps
we are in a situation where we do not know what
to do. All doors seem closed. We have no idea
which way to turn. The plan on which we had set
our hearts fails to materialize. We are blocked and
utterly bewildered.
At times like these the one and only avenue of
escape is reliance on the Power within. So few of
us realize there is such a Power. We feel we have
to do everything for ourselves. It is true we have
the active part in carrying out our duty in the ma
terial world. But a greater Wisdom than ours is
at the helm to steer our ship. The sooner we know
this, the better for all concerned. Our work will
improve, the strain will lift, and best of all we
shall reach our objective with a minimum of ef
fort.
We make life so unnecessarily difficult. We
think we have to stand alone. When we are in ex
tremis, we turn to God ; and all the time, with us
every step of the way, is this great reservoir of
Wisdom and Strength, untapped, unrecognized.

When we are the loneliest, we have at our side the
truest of friends. When we seem utterly helpless,
there stands ready the greatest of helpers. When
we are sick, weak, completely discouraged, the
great Physician is near to heal, comfort, and
strengthen. "Closer is He than breathing, nearer
than hands and feet."
We know the anguish of loss when the one we
love more than life itself disappears from our
sight. The tenderness that has enveloped our
every moment, the comfort and understanding
that have never failed—all are gone. We wander
in the wilderness of loss and grief; and at every
step the greatest of lovers is witn us, the One who
understands our every emotion, our every thought.
Self-centered in our own misery, we do not see
Him. We cannot hear His voice or feel the touch
of His hand.
Only Infinite Patience could wait so long for rec
ognition. Only Infinite Love could survive such
ignorant rebuffs. Only Infinite Wisdom could
smile at such short-sighted childishness. When
our grief is deepest, warm arms enfold us. When
our need is greatest, a hand grasps our trembling
fingers. When our eyes are blinded with tears, we
are led safely out of anguish and despair.
Why? Why? Why? There are reasons, of course,
which with our limited knowledge we cannot
grasp. We do know, however, that the cry in the
night is answered, that a way always appears,
that no suffering lasts forever, and that even

" sudden burst of sunshine breaks through the
clouds. A rainbow spans the heavens. The unex

endurance. Then suddenly we see the end of the
ordeal.
When We know deep within us that no distress
can last forever, why can we not live in the faith
that is knowledge ? We can thereby keep the even
tenor of our way and refuse to sink under the load
we carry. If we see the end from the beginning,
we can train ourselves to center on that end and
forget the intermediate steps. This attitude short
ens the period of probation. By ignoring trouble
we drop it. By centering on hopeful expectancy we
gain the end desired.
Our thoughts may be generous and kind. Then
we run counter to a distressed mind, distorted in
viewpoint, delighting in making other people suf
fer. What are we to do? Live so far as possible in
the center of peace within ourselves. If we are not
strong enough to meet the situation, Fate will
eventually remove us or change the conditions.
Not all tests can be successfully passed. Even if

forgiveness helps to nullify the apparent weak
ness.
This harmony within one's own soul is vital to
development, for it means harmony with the
highest we know. We cannot vibrate to higher
planes of knowledge and achievement unless we
are in accord with those loftier levels of thought
and action. Times of withdrawal from lower vibra
tions may become necessary until we gain suffi
cient spiritual strength to withstand cross-cur
rents and keep our own equilibrium. This with
drawal is not necessarily a sign of failure. It
should be a girding of the loins to meet new situa
tions with new strength.
The tangled threads of human lives reach far
back into the past. For every difficulty there is a
reason; for every antipathy, a cause. Sooner or
later the chemical of selfless love dissolves all
knots in the pattern and smoothes the threads in
perfect interblending and coordination. This takes
time but come it must.
Meanwhile we do our part as best we can. Hope
should never fail. It is an essential part of our spir
itual equipment. Along with it comes imagina
tion which never loses the picture of the perfect
pattern. Night must go; day must break. Rain
must stop ; sun must shine. Clouds must pass and
stars appear. Centered on the joyful outcome of
all perplexities, we forget our troubles and live in
the happiness to come.

some day will make him the champion. We can
even try this as a game of skills. When we do any
work long enough, it becomes automatic. Habit

The Tide of Opportunity
IHERE is a time for everything under the sun.
The wise man seizes the opportunity at the ap
pointed moment and proceeds on a happier and
more satisfactory journey- The uninformed or un
observant lets the chance slip by unnoticed and re
mains the poorer. We do not mean to imply that
opportunity comes but once in a life-time. That is
not true. Certain ages are of course better than
others for the acquisition of certain skills. It is
more difficult to train mind and body after a cer
tain limit has been passed. Greater effort is re
quired for less result. This applies only to the ma
terial world, however.
In the science of soul, opportunity is ever pres
ent. We grasp a spiritual truth and it becomes a
part of us. It sinks deep into consciousness and re
mains as a constant resource and refreshment.
The old-fashioned conversion, so-called, was not
limited to young or old. All responded according to
the inner urge. God is ready at all times in all
places. The "tide in the affairs of men" does not
affect Him, for all tides are His. It is a great bless
ing for us that He waits, that the chance is never
lost. Tragic indeed would be the fate of a soul for
whom there was no longer any hope. The moment

the dreary present and a longing for better things,
that moment our chance comes. We can never en
tirely lose it again. A beginning has been made.
God's opportunities arise from man's necessi
ties, as has been so often said. Grief, suffering,
despair make us turn for comfort and strength to
a Power greater than ourselves. The child who
stubs his toe and tumbles picks himself up and
runs to his mother for comfort. We grown-up
children do the same. When we can no longer help
ourselves, we call for help. Our cry has an imme
diate response in that the portal of our inner self
begins to swing open and makes possible a very
real communion with higher planes.
It might be well to fix in our minds this concep
tion of various levels of being, all closely connect
ed. The unseen is far more real than the seen ; the
spiritual far more permanent than the material.
On the earth side all is constant change from
birth to death; no landmarks remain untouched.
On the spirit side are the patterns, indestructible,
perfect. Even a beautiful design may be ruined by
imperfection in the material or the making. The
moment the human element steps in, the ideal be
comes obscured, hidden by the very nature of the
imperfect plane on which it is expressing. It takes
the eye of the poet, the lover, to catch this beauty
in apparent ugliness, this harmony in seeming dis
cord. Most of us cannot see or hear it.
Once we make up our minds, however, to find
Truth, our opportunity arrives. The road is not

easy; no worthwhile training can be soft. Persis
tency of effort, faith in the quest bring the inevit
able reward. We cannot attain by one leap; but
the initial impulse may come like a flash of light
ning, which illumines the whole being and changes
aim and outlook.
We should pray for such illumination and await
it in sure faith. When we least expect, it will ar
rive and make the next step clear. This is the true
"tide in the affairs of men" which takes us out of
shallows and of miseries. How short-sighted to
neglect the most important thing in life—the
knowledge of the purpose for which we came and
the glorious destiny that is ours.

Blind Flying
rpHE inexplicable changes and chances of for-
tune become clear when we know the underly
ing causes. Immutable law works here as every
where. Our only course is to go with it, not strug
gle against it. We must ride the air-currents as
seasoned travellers in the confidence that we are
headed for a safe landing. We could understand
much of what is now obscure if we were developed
to that point. At our present stage, however, such
knowledge would be a two-edged sword. We could
not use it without great danger. Not until we are
ready can we take such information and handle it
wisely.
There are times in life when blind flying be
comes necessary. We have to trust to the mecha
nism of Providence like those who put themselves
in the hands of an automatic pilot. Providence is
by no means a robot ; no greater intelligence exists
than the knowledge of the AU-Knower, the wis
dom of the All-Wise. We have to go with it as lit
tle children who have no thought of the morrow
and no care for the day. The more we can culti
vate this habit of dependence on the great Guide
of all life and all experience, the sooner can we
find the peace our hearts desire.
This does not mean a devil-may-care attitude.

GOD'S COUNTRY
It does not mean laziness or slackness or lack of
effort in any form. It does mean steady concen
tration of will to do our part as that part becomes
clear and to leave all worry as to the outcome in
the hands of the Director of our course, Who
knows where we are going and why, and what we
are destined to accomplish. Steady reliance on that
Power will give us intuitions, "hunches", clear con
victions, unusual opportunities, until by experience
we learn the art of putting ourselves entirely in
the hands of our Greater Self. Understand there is
no slackening of effort. The chances are we shall
work harder than ever. The great difference is
we have no worry about the outcome. We act in
the calm assurance that all is and will be well as
long as we keep in direct touch with the highest
we know-
It is uncertainty about the future that kills—
the corroding anxiety that saps energy and under
mines strength. All such attitudes are worse than
futile. They are definitely destructive. Instead of
progressing we stand blocked, eventually to slide
back. Meanwhile time and opportunity are lost.
We head straight for disaster.
We all crave happiness. We like to see others
happy. Man was made to rejoice, but he has wan
dered far from the Source of joy and lost his per
spective. It would be well worth the experiment
to train ourselves to live entirely in the present,
resting secure in the faith of a happy future un
der unfailing guidance. This is not the happy-go

The Future of the Republic
rpHE work ahead needs clear minds and clean
hearts. For that reason we have emphasized
the spiritual side of man's make-up and the es
sential need of spiritual development. All of this
is definitely linked with the future of our Repub
lic. God's country cannot remain God's unless the
people in it do His will. They cannot have the wis
dom to do His will unless they develop the atti
tude of agents. They cannot be agents if they do
not open and keep open the channels of communi
cation.
An operative on an important mission may
know the ultimate objective or he may have the
key to only one move at a time. His contacts must
be right or he will fail and his homeland suffer.
He is usually a link in a chain ; if he drops out, the
chain breaks. The important moves are planned
far ahead; the intermediate steps may be left to
the agent's own ingenuity. He taps certain help at
certain times. His mission may be to stand and
wait until the order comes. But he never loses
sight of the fact that he is acting for a Power
greater than himself, which depends on him to
carry out orders and use his head.
In a sense this analogy applies to us as citizens
of the Republic. To be skilled we must subject

ourselves to strenuous training. We must count no
sacrifice of the lower self too great for the high
mission which is ours. It may be an obscure part
about which the world will never know. It may be
among the seats of the mighty. We stand pledged
to the highest of which we are capable. Too many
have suffered and died, for us to be weaklings
now.
While we wait for our individual cue, we have
time and opportunity to make ourselves letter-per
fect. God's country by its very nature is a spiri
tual domain. If we are to serve, we must develop
our spiritual nature and learn to live in it until the
practice becomes automatic and the viewpoint far-
reaching.
Only so can we respond when the emergency
arises and the time comes for us to step into
action. Preparedness is four-fifths of the game,
spiritual preparedness, for with such equipment
we cannot fail. We lose the personal in the uni
versal, the selfish in the unselfish, the ephemeral
in the eternal. As a link in a long chain we pass
the word to the one waiting to receive it at the ap
pointed time and place. The chain must remain un
broken, that golden chain which binds us in love
to the Eternal.
Thus we lose our life in service only to save it
in the greater whole. The personal fate of the in
dividual is in this sense unimportant; the success
of the mission is all that counts. We know the
complete fearlessness of one who has lost himself

in the cause he serves and lives only for that
cause, ready to catch the slightest whisper of com
mand and act accordingly. The Republic needs our
devotion as never before. We have been asleep at
the switch too long. The war between light and
darkness goes on and on. If we would save our
heritage we must be ready at a moment's notice
to do our part. This means complete purity of
mind and heart so that we can hear the inner
voice, and hearing, fearlessly obey. For this we
have come at our appointed time. If our part is to
stand and wait, we can at least be sentries at
listening-posts, keyed to catch the slightest whis
per and relay it to the next in command. God's
country calls for our devoted service. Are we
