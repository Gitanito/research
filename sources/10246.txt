      A decent man 2016-10-04 10:32 18,452  

  Believe it otherwise regretting, the purgatory ----An NDE due to a car accident.     

    People say they will either go to hell or go to heaven after they die; however, I went to hell in my near-death experience. It happened around 11 o’clock at night that day when I was 20 years old.  I was driving alone and trying to get my buddies to have a drink. Instead, I ran into a car accident before I even had a chance to find any friends. It was so traumatic that I was in the hospital unconsciously for two weeks.     

    It seemed like I walked into another world during my near-death experience while I was unresponsive. The other dimension is very much similar to ours though - there were many streets, shops, but expect for the emptiness as no one was there. I walked along the streets trying to find people. Finally, I saw a crowd of people after I had walked for about an hour, so I approached them to get help. They all stood in line quietly . When I talked to them, they would not respond. I was clueless as to why they did not talk to me, and I was so naive that I Joined them as well.     

    Strangely, I was the only one who talked and the rest of them were passionless and stared forward. I couldn’t help but coming along with them. As the line matching forward, there were several ferocious guys walking toward me, gazing at me. I was wondering why they came directly me.     

    Unexpectedly, the shops along the roadsides were caught on fire. The huge and fierce fire burned off all the shops. It seemed like the whole world was under flames while I was watching it. Very horrible! If the purgatory were made of fire, then I believed this is hell.     

    I was very frightened when these two husky guys pull me aside so far to a place where no one was there. They said, “It is not your time yet, go back now.” I was so curious that I was vacuumed upward even before I was going to make any comment.     

    Next, I had experienced a short-term memory loss after I woke up in the hospital. I could not remember things that happened last month excluding my near-death experience. If you ask me whether or not there is a hell and I can tell you that it does definitely.     

    The whole experience seemed like it happened yesterday, although it was ten years ago. I did see hell after I died.  Now, I am a Christian and believe Jesus will meet me in heaven after death.  If you are a nonbeliever, you can consider accepting Jesus to be your God.  Besides, I reassured my NDE was real and I am the experiencer.
