THE FOUR SOURCES OF WISDOM
There are, it is said in the Teachings of Manu, four great sources
of Wisdom :
1 . There is Revelation, as, for example, given in the Scriptures
of the world.
2. There are the Experiences of the Wise.
3. There is the Vision of the Enlightened.
4. There is the Right Living of the Virtuous.
This book on Symbolic Yoga is, perhaps, a little of each, written
down by one who aspires to benefit from all.
PREFACE
In publishing The Lotus Fire : A Study in Symbolic Yoga, I am very
conscious of the fact that its only value lies in the extent to which it is
able to suggest to the adventurous thinker and student of life heretofore
uncharted fields for fruitful exploration. The book consists of notes taken
at the time of my own personal explorations in a field in which I had long
been keenly interested, explorations which were fortunate enough to have
the guidance of One whose discoveries in innumerable fields have con-
stituted Him a Master of the Wisdom of Life. But even this guidance gives
the notes no special authority, for both the guidance and the explorations
are individual to myself.
The value of the guidance and the explorations lies, as I have said,
in the extent to which these stimulate the adventurous and challenging spirit
of the reader, sending him forth on his own unique way, and by no means
seeking to invite his adherence to the way I
myself am travelling.
Far from presuming to disclose truth and to invite the reader to
accept it, I am only disclosing a way I have found which appears to lead in
the direction of something true for me. The notes which constitute the
material published were written down while the actual journeyings were
taking place which led to the discovery of the Symbols. At some risk of
redundance and incoherence, they have been left as far as possible intact,
so that to some extent at least they may convey the strange atmosphere of
the events they describe.
On the other hand, much material has been added both by way of
corroboration, of comparison, and of indications as to further study ; and I
have very specially to thank Mrs. Adeltha Peterson, of Adyar, for her
most valuable assistance in this respect. Mrs. Peterson is herself a deep
student of Theosophy and of the occult, and her sympathetic understanding
10 THE LOTUS FIRE
has immensely facilitated both the investigations and the writing of them
down. I thank also Miss Helen Veale and Miss Edith Pinchin for comments
of value.
To Mrs. Dinshaw, also of Adyar, my very special thanks are no less
due for giving particular assistance in preparing the notes for publication,
including the very excellent synopses of the various chapters preceding
each book, and for a most careful and critical revision of the proofs.
Mrs. Halsey and those who worked with her have been of invalu-
able help in preparing an adequate index, a work involving many weeks of
concentrated effort.
To Mr. Conrad Woldringh I owe the exquisite little
drawings he
has made, and also the beautiful frontispiece. The artistic production
of much of Adyar's literary output is due to his genius. And as usual
Mr. C. Subbarayudu and his co-workers of the Vasanta Press at Adyar have
given their skill and their patience in those important mechanical processes
whereby thoughts are able to incarnate in gracious forms.
Finally, I am gratefully thankful to Rukmini Devi for her constant
inspiration, and I offer respectful homage to Adyar for making possible
these excursions into the Kingdom of Yoga. There are but a few places
on the world's surface where Yoga can be effectively and safely under-
taken. Among these places, Adyar certainly stands very high.

PROEM
HOW THE BOOK CAME TO BE WRITTEN
The origin of this book lay in the fact that I have been
for a very long time interested in Symbology as a means of
conveying metaphysical conceptions within a very limited
and tangible compass.
Cosmic Events | venture to believe that if we could contact the
as Symbol-
Formulae highest reaches of consciousness, however feebly, we could
reduce the greatest happenings, or for the matter of that
all happenings, in the evolutionary process, into Symbols or
Formulae.
God works m A symbol is born because God. Nature, works in
Formulae
formulae. Every living thing is a symbol, a very extraordi-
nary symbol, and I have always desired to understand life in
terms of its reduction into symboljc formulae. When I
watched a great Indian lady dancing the Hindu classical
dance, Bharata Natya, I knew that each one of the gestures,
each one of the postures, was a reflection of some ultimate
Symbol or Formula.
Power Release And it came to me that if
only I could understand and
through the
Dance enter into the essence of the Dance of Shiva, I should then
be able in some degree to perceive the Ultimates of the
Dance, the Ultimates of Being, of Life, and I should then be
able to see how every gesture, in fact every movement of
every part of the body, has its own cosmic significance, so
that anyone who knew the dance as the dance really is
would be able to watch in each element of the dance the
12 THE LOTUS FIRE

expression of a mighty truth, the release of a spiritual
power.
I
pondered over this for very long, until one night one
of the Great Beings, who is a Messenger of the Lord
Shiva, disclosed to me, one after another, certain Symbols
in their cosmic significance, showing them with the ease
and the splendour of the ali-pervading, all-rhythmic power
which He naturally exercises. And when in His Home He
showed me these Symbolic Ultimates, the whole vista of the
meaning and purpose of evolution gradually unveiled itself
before me, and I have done my best to write it all down as
I have perceived it, and, where I
could, to obtain corrobora-
tion from the great books of our Theosophical classic
literature.
Not that I wanted any corroboration. When you
know, you know. But I felt it
might be a matter of
convenience for some students of The Theosophical Society,
for whom the book is especially intended, to perceive that
I have not in fact been outside the great picture of Life as,
for example, H. P. Blavatsky has unfolded it to us. I
have,
perhaps, seen the picture otherwise, but I think I have seen
the same picture, modified, of course, by my own personal
equation and smaller stature.
So was it that from an intense interest in Truth as
depicted in a great sequence of dancing postures and
movements, I found myself contemplating as in direct
ascent from these a specific series of Symbols Ultimate, from
which all Truth depends, be the forms, the colours, the
sounds, the expressions, what they may.
The purpose of this book, therefore, is to release
an aspect of the evolutionary process somewhat different
from that to which we are accustomed, and also to help
those who are genuinely interested in
Yoga to study
a specialized line which will be safe and at the same
time fruitful.
PROEM 13
The Real Yoga
of Hinduism
A Manual of
Creation
I have every reason to believe that this particular form
of Yoga is
essentially the same as those forms which we are
in the habit of studying in the sacred books of Hinduism, but
I do definitely feel that the translations of these which are at
our disposal, and even the original Samskrit, are by no
means adequate the translations because these are always
into non-Yoga languages, and the Samskrit because most of
its modern interpreters do not know Yoga even though
they may know Samskrit : and do they at all know the real
Samskrit, the Samskrit which is the language of the Gods ?
When men study Samskrit, its life inevitably becomes veiled
even from its students. Perhaps most of the commentaries
are cleverly arranged to prevent people from discovering
what they had better not discover. There is the same
preventing here, but this particular form of Yoga lends
itself to the comparatively simple understanding of the
modern world.
I
begin my book with The Stanzas of Dzyan, the great
Manual of Creation, preserved for countless ages in the
imperishable occult records, and translated from its
Symbolic
Senzar
1
for the first time into English by Madame
Blavatsky for The Secret Doctrine, which as a whole is a
commentary thereon. The Stanzas of Dzyan are utterly
fundamental to the conceptions of Yoga with which this book
deals. Over and over again, it is
necessary for me to
refer to The Stanzas, to show how this, that and the other
Stanza treats of this, that and the other symbol, for the Yoga
herein described is a form of the Symbolic Yoga of The
Stanzas. As in ancient days, we are now just beginning
to perceive and use symbols for our deeper evolutionary
unfoldment. There is no question of modes of breathing
or any other type of physical exercise. Though there are
certain preconditions necessary for this Yoga development,
all is within the compass of the earnest individual who

Two Versions of

Experience
is moved to ascend the ladder of growth with the aid of
Symbolic Yoga.
I am not only publishing The Stanzas, as we know
them in The Secret Doctrine, but I also publish for ready
correlation, side by side The Stanzas in their original
form, preserved in the Archives of The Theosophical
Society at Adyar, Madras, India. In a number of instances,
this original form throws further elucidation on The Stanzas
as published.
Following The Stanzas, the book falls naturally into
four Sections and a Supplement :
Book One : The Vigil of Purification, in which I tell of
pre-requisites for this type of Yoga and preparatory stages
leading thereto.
Book Two :
Symbols Living and Radiant, a descrip-
tion of the symbols as I have seen them.
Book Three :
Symbols Released and Dynamic, where-
in I
apply the symbols to various aspects of daily growth,
and to the Colour-Spectrum, Jewels, Mantras, Music,
Rhythms, and so on.
Book Four : From the Symbols to No-Symbol from
the symbols in the Chakras, the Cycles, the great Initiations,
and so on, to THAT the Symbol-less.
Book Five :
Symbols at Work, that is, material to
help the student correlate the symbols with Embryology,
Plant Life, the Mineral Kingdom, the various Energies in
Physics, the Zodiac, the Rays. There is additionaljhnaterial
to help him in his Yoga, such as the great Hymns of
some of the mighty Eucharists, passages on Sacrifice,
the Yoga of Mountains, the Grail of Motherhood, etc.
I
ought to add that the contents of the book, so far as
regards all but a small portion of it, are simply the record
of my experiences as I wrote them down night after night
the small hours of each new day. They represent,
n
therefore, a first-hand word-picture of that at which I was at
PROEM 15
In a Condition
of Yoga
the very moment looking and was experiencing. I had no
occasion either to choose my words so as to make the
record polished or to guard against either repetitions or
apparent contradictions.
I
give the record practically as I wrote it, for my
friends tell me that it is truer and fresher to leave it as
it first came to me rather than to edit it
away from direct
relationship with experiences which certainly are really in-
expressible in terms of any language. Let there be repeti-
tions, contradictions. Inevitably there were repetitions, for it
is impossible to understand these cosmic immensities save
vaguely ; and repetitions, perhaps also contradictions, are
needed even
r
r
the dim picturing I
present. I have only
seen as throL v
,i a glass darkly, for the relative can make
little contact with the Absolute, at all events in the waking
consciousness down here out here and I had always to
try to see over and over again, now from one angle, now
from another. At the utmost can I
say that now I see,
perhaps, as through a glass less darkly. Curiously, I find
that as a book the matter is as new to me as it must be
to the reader. I am as ,much a student of it as he may
choose to be.
It was in a condition of Yoga that the experiences
came to me, and out of that condition much of it is as
strange to me and may I
say without conceit, wonderful
as it must at least be strange to the reader. I
hope it is
strange to every reader, for we need strangenesses in our
lives, the unaccustomed, the different, the shaking and the
shock-giving, so that we become electrified out of our
habitual selves into our larger selves. It is indeed good
to live from time to time in strange worlds, where we have
no bearings, having lost those which are normally familiar
to us. Only through contacting the devastatingly different,
the revolutionizing^ different, can we know our own unique-
nesses, our own essential differences.
16 THE LOTUS FIRE
May I also say that I
finally chose as the title of the
The Title of the record

A STUDY IN SYMBOLIC YOGA
largely because the particular form of Yoga I have
attempted to describe is indeed Fire, and has as its heart
the Lotus conception ? I did not myself think of this title.
But when a friend suggested it, I saw at once its
appro-
priateness. The Lotus is a Fire no less than a Flower.
Its
very petals are mighty flames issuing forth from a
central Fire-reservoir. Every Symbol I have tried to describe
is a Fire, but all are contained within the Lotus-Symbol, for
the Lotus is, in terms of its seed, the very Forthgoing itself,
and in its flower the outward and visible sign of that
Consummation which is the attar of the flower itself. And
I do not hesitate to say that even the Lotus we see lifting
up its glorious head to the light of our Lord the Sun l
is as
much a fire as it seems to be matter, and as much a
gorgeous burst of song as it seems to be a splendid
form.
All is Fire^ and Fire is itself a symbol of resistless
Power.

unafraid, unabashed, uncrmging, steadfastly looking

worship Thee, O Giver of Resistless Power, and
so do I cause Thee to rejoice, for thus from out
the vastness of Thy Universe once mdre comes an
echo of Thy Being, bearing witness that the Seed of
Thy Sacrifice is ever blossoming into the Flower of
Thy Triumph.

The original of The Book of Dzyan is in the hands of the august
Head of the Occult Hierarchy, and has been seen by none. None knows
40 THE BOOK OF DZYAN
how old it is, but it is rumoured that the earlier part of it
(consisting of the
first six
Stanzas) has an origin altogether anterior to this world, and even
that it is not a history, but a series of directions rather a formula for
creation than an account of it.
" A copy of it is
kept in the museum of the Brotherhood, and it is
that copy (itself probably the oldest book produced on this
planet) which
Madame Blavatsky and several of her pupils have seen which she describes
so graphically in The Secret Doctrine. [' Pages from a Pre-historic Record :
An archaic Manuscript a collection of palm leaves made impermeable to
water, fire, and air, by some specific and unknown process is before the
writer's eye. On the first page is an immaculate white disk within a dull
black ground . . .' S.D.,
1
I, 31 ; Adyar ed., I,
69.]
The book has, however, several peculiarities which she does not there
mention. It
appears to be very highly magnetized, for as soon as a man
takes a page in his hand he sees passing before his eyes a vision of the
events which it is intended to portray, while at the same time he seems
to hear a sort of rhythmic description of them in his own language, so far
as that language will convey the ideas involved. Its pages contain no
words whatever nothing but symbols."

Book One The Vigil of Purification
SYNOPSIS OF BOOK ONE
PROEM
One night one of the Great Beings, a Messenger of the Lord
Shiva, disclosed to me, in His home, certain Symbols in their cosmic
significance ; and when He showed these Symbolic Ultimates. the
whole vista of the meaning and purpose of evolution unveiled itself
before me, and I have done my best to write it all down as I have
perceived it, and where I could, to obtain corroboration from our
Theosophical classic literature. It is a Yoga of the Memory of the
Divinity in all things.
PROLOGUE
I am thinking of Ultimates of those symbols which are among the
formulae of God the Creator They are multi-dimensional, and tran-
scend all confinement within two or three. They may be sketched on
a piece of paper, but the true student will only use such a sketch as a
starting-point, whence he unfolds the sketch-note into a symphony of
sound-colour-form. The person who desires to succeed in Yoga must be
balanced between undue asceticism on the one hand, and disruptive
indulgence on the other.
Chapter 1
THE YOGA OF ACCELERATION
In Kali Yuga, the injunction,
"
Let him that thinketh he standeth
take heed lest he fall," has very special significance. A feature of the
forces of retardation is that they seem not only to differ very little
from the forces of acceleration, but to offer much more. This Yoga is
to help alt to tread their ways more quickly by bringing into their daily
lives some of the great Formulae of Life ; and it is to help them to
guard against the temptations of the forces of retardation by giving
them opportunities constantly to hold before themselves Truths (which
are hidden within themselves) with the aid of these same great
Mnemonics of Living.

Chapter 2
YUGAS AND YOGA
As Yuga succeeds Yuga, so does the Eternal Truth descend more
and more into symbols In this Kali Yuga the symbol-note must be at
its height, for men, not yet being able to know Truth face to face, must
know it as through a symbol, darkly. This form of Yoga is for the
Kali Yuga.
Chapter 3
YOGA REAL AND UNREAL
There is a flood of pseudo-occult literature, which is as mischievous
as it is false, and some are so foolish as to believe that for the payment
of a sum of money the principles of Yoga may be acquired

Real Yoga
needs arduous and prolonged training, which is known by the genuine
student to be essential to the development of those forces which build
lofty character and truly spiritual stature, and all the power that comes
therewith.
Chapter 4
THE YOGA OF THE INDIVIDUAL
We knock. You open not to admit from without, but rather to
release from within You will see how glorifying these symbols must
become when translated into those vibrations which the student can most
readily use in the outer world Even if he cannot express here that
which he can shape there, the inspiration of his achievements in the
realms of more sensitive substance is bound to flow down, and give the
worker what we call heroism, genius, or sainthood, according to his mode
of expression.
Chapter 5
THE ULTIMATES OF LIFE
This Yoga is for the purpose of striving to gain some direct impres-
sion of some of the Ultimates of Life or Being. I see, in the farthest
distance, a mighty range of Mountain-Symbols I have perceived their
substance-shadows in my very self. And I record all I have been able
to understand of an illumined Vision of the Real.
Chapter 6
WITHDRAWAL OR GATHERING IN ?
If we die, it is because we have not yet learned how to live. If we
kill, it is because we have not yet learned how to cherish. If we with-
draw, it is because we have not yet learned how to include. In this
Symbolic Yoga, we move on our way by fulfilling, by sublimitmg, by per-
SYNOPSIS 45
forming those acts which are the reflections in the outer world of the
real acts of Transubstantiation in the inner.
Chapter 7
THE SCIENCE OF FULFILMENT
To look our weaknesses in the face, and not to seek to cast them
off, is the particular note of this Yoga Only those are qualified for
Yoga who are constantly fulfilling both their virtues and their weaknesses.
There is no weakness which does not point the way to strength There
is no strength which does not need further refining. We must learn to
dist'l all experience. We must learn how to release God in all
things,
and to take Him with us everywhere In the midst of achievement the
Yogi lifts up his eyes unto loftier heights, and soon departs to tread the
way to regions more sublime. The divine discontent of God as He
makes His universe must be mirrored in us, as we make ours.
Chapter 8
THE YOGA OF MARRIAGE
Marriage and the processes of procreation are among the holi-
nesses of living, as is death, as is birth, as is active entry into the larger
consciousness of citizenship, and so forth. The sacraments of marriage
and of conception are among the most potent forces of life, for they
are among the living witnesses to our Divinity No aspirant for the
crown of the Yogi could ever desecrate that which is holy beyond all
words of expression.
Chapter 9
ENEMIES WITHIN THE GATES
The aspirant must purify his vehicles, by abstaining from alcohol,
smoking and flesh-foods, and practise strictest harmlessness, shrinking
from no human ridicule or contempt to achieve that glorious aid and
blessing which purity and harmlessness bestow. And he must consider
it a major crime to place in the way of any Yogi, unconscious or self-
conscious, an obstacle of any kind, for every obstacle thus placed
becomes an obstacle in his own way, and only as he removes the
obstacle from the path of his brother, will its counterpart in his own way
disappear.
Chapter 10
A FLASH FROM FAR-OFF ULTIMATES
In this form of Yoga a contemplation of far-off Ultimates forms an
essential part of the earliest training. It
brings the student into touch
with the great End while he is still, as it were, fumbling with the means.
Thus, on the very beginning of his way shines a reflection of those
Ultimates which it will necessarily take him aeons to achieve.
46 THE VIGIL OF PURIFICATION
Chapter 1 1
A LORD OF YOGA
The Lord of Yoga who revealed to me this particular form of the
Science is a Personage who embodies the Dance of Shiva, the Yoga of
Eternal Rhythm. He is a reflection of Nataraja, of Krishna, of Orpheus,
and an Inspirer of all who sing and dance to the glory of God and in the
service of His Life. Through forms, postures, gestures, movements, in
colour and sound, He embodies the Law of Adjustment, whereby the
whole world draws ever nearer to the Real. In the mode of Yoga
disclosed by Him, each act of Yoga involves a blending of the origins,
ways, and end of life, so that it becomes a potent means whereby the
circumstances of time obtain adjustment to their eternal archetypes.
Chapter 12
THE ALTAR OF SUBLIMATION
The whole process of sublimation has yet to become clear. It is
highly individual to each student. Each student must examine the
whole content of each of his consciousnesses physical, astral and the
rest so as to perceive what he has to exalt and how he is to exalt
it. But this Yoga does not involve any withdrawal from plane after
plane of consciousness, but rather a fulfilment of plane after plane.
Chapter 1 3
I WILL LIFT UP MINE EYES UNTO THE HILLS
"
As a child may be lifted upon the shoulders of his father to see
with delight that which must otherwise be hidden from him, so the
self-controlled and humble aspirant may be enfolded in the magic
blessing of an Elder which shall reveal to him the mightier heights,
the very symbols themselves of that Supreme Transubstantiatioa
which glorifies all Earths and makes all Heavens still more sublime.
PROLOGUE
The Ultimatesm | n his Epilogue to New Pathways in Science, Sir Arthur
Symbol
Eddington says :
My conclusion is that, although for the most part our
inquiry into the problem of experiences ends in a veil of symbols,
there is an immediate knowledge in the minds of conscious beings
which lifts the veil in places ; and what we discern through these
openings is of mental and spiritual nature. Elsewhere we see no
more than the veil.
In my Prologue to this Study in Symbolic Yoga, may I
say that I am perhaps trying to begin with those very symbols
in which Sir Arthur so rightly perceives the solution of the
problem of experiences to end ? I am well aware that, as
I have set them forth, the symbols examined in this book
are by no means those to which Sir Arthur alludes. He
is, I
imagine, thinking of those symbols of science, and
possibly of religion, more immediately connected with such
frontiers in experience as science and religion may have
reached. I am thinking of Ultimates, as I have called them,
of those Symbols
1
which are among the formulae of God
the Creator, rather than of those which are among the
formulae of Man the Seeker.

Speaking of the phenomenon of the
"
release
"
of consciousness, Jung
declares
"
The achievement of such a symbolic unity is beyond the power of
the conscious will because, in this case, the conscious is partisan. Its opponent
is the collective unconscious which does not understand the language of the
conscious. Therefore it is necessary to have the
'
magically
'
effective symbol
which contains those primitive analogies that speak to the unconscious. The
unconscious can only be reached and expressed by the symbol, which is the
reason why the process of individuation can never do without the symbol.
The s^nbol is, on the-one hand, the primitive expression of the unconscious,
while on the other hand, it is an idea corresponding to the highest intuition
produced by Consciousness." The Secret of the Golden Flower, p, 105.

Material
It is
possible, I think, to gain some glimpse of these.
1 believe I have done so with the aid of a Scientist who is
infinitely nearer to God than I. And I seek to communi-
cate these to you, not that you may accept them, but that,
looking upon them, you may the more clearly see your way
to discover for your very selves the symbols of God. You
may see His formulae otherwise than I am seeing them. It
is
enough that you perceive them, for to each individual
God-in-the-Becoming is his own vision of Divinity. Ap-
proach the veils before you, and seek in lawful ways to
lift them.
Let me also say that the mighty Truths of Yoga can
never be described, still less understood, within the con-
fines of the mind alone, whether Universal or merely human.
They must flash forth from the very Will of God
Himself, veiled as may be expedient from the excess of
their glory, and drenching the whole consciousness of their
recipient.
It is as if God draws His Symbol-Sword, flashing it
forth into the consciousness of the would-be knight of
Yoga, so that he too draws his sword, Excalibur, and enters
upon his quest for Truth.
Such indeed is the inner significance of the legend of
King Arthur and his Knights who sought the Holy Grail.

The Cup of the Christ was a symbol of the fulfilment of
the Yoga of a man becoming Superman.

To live this Yoga He who is called the Christ sent
forth Jesus, that in mankind's midst there might be renewed

decides, after long meditation and deep aspirational
seeking, to practise this particular form of Symbolic Yoga.
The reason why I have not made any such suggestions
is for the simple reason that I
myself received no precise
indications, but was left to find my way amidst a mass of, to
me, priceless material.
I have tried in some sort of way to describe the
material available, or rather some of the material available,
for the benefit of those who by temperament, or in any
other way, find themselves inclined in the direction of this
form of Symbolic Yoga. But I am bound to leave to each
student the discovery of the best w6y of employing the
material, for to each student the material presents itself
differently, according to his approach-motif. I think that
the general statements I have made should suffice to guide
him. He may regard them as principles or hypotheses,
but he must apply them in terms of his own uniqueness.
I
cannot, however, too strongly insist on a careful and
thorough preliminary preparation, especially of the physical
body and of the feelings and emotions.
The physical body must be made reasonably free from

contamination, for contamina-
tion all these are when we look upon them with clear percep-
tion. It must have been free for some time for a year at
least. Further, the physical body must be kept as clean
as possible, with special attention to inner cleanliness and
to cleanliness of hands and feet.
The physical body and feelings and emotions must
be at peace, and in the best health available, though ill-
health is not necessarily a bar, at all events to gentle and
unstrained practice.
It is desirable that the use of even the milder medic-
inal drugs be kept to the minimum, as stimulant or narcotic
drugs are an inevitable barrier to Yoga practice. Glandular

therapy, and other remedies obtained at the expense of
animal life, must be avoided not only by the student of
Yoga who wishes to keep his vehicle free from contamin-
ation, but by all who wish to protect themselves from the
terrible consequences attendant upon increasing the suffer-
ings of our younger brothers. Note carefully what is said
in a later chapter
l
on "
The Protective Web."
In the case of the removal of any of the vital organs
of the body, all of which, be it remembered, have a direct
relation to the higher centres in the physical body and to their
counterparts in the higher bodies, the body may take many
years for readjustment before other organs can, if it all,
take over the inner functions of those removed. Yoga
practices during this period may completely derange the
nervous and brain functions, and the harmonious relation-
ship between the outer and inner vehicles.
In the practice of Yoga, common sense is a pre-requi-
site. All wise writers warn students against the dangers of
focussing undue attention, either of thought, breath, tone,
etc., on specific centres of the body. They also warn that
at the slightest sense of pain, heaviness, giddiness, or of
undue stress, the practice should be stopped, as pain is
always a danger-signal that the bodies are not in synchro-
nous vibration, or that the lower vehicles are receiving too
great a pressure for their strain -capacity.
The person who desires to succeed in Yoga should be
balanced between undue asceticism on the one hand and
disruptive indulgence on the other, whether it be in the
things of the body, the emotions, or the lower mind."
Those who find themselves as yet unable to take up
the more serious practices of Yoga can lead lives of

goodwill, simplicity, purification. Let them harmonize them-
selves and their vehicles with all around them in the service
of the One Life. An attempt may be made to understand
the inner meaning of the Symbols. Sooner or later the
physical disabilities will drop away, and the time spent in
preparation will herald an even more rapid progress. There
is never any time lost in a serious and sustained search for
the Path of Yoga, or Union with the One Self.
Among feelings and emotions, irritability must be
reduced to a minimum, hatred having been long ago trans-
muted, of course. Understanding must be the law in terms
of Reverence, Goodwill and Compassion. The spirit of
instinctual and also of intuitive generosity and appreciation
should pervade the whole of this field of consciousness.
And it is of the utmost importance that the lacerating in-
fluences of excitement should be avoided.
The mind must free itself from pride, from the spirit
of destructive criticism, and from a sense of superiority,
though there must, of course, be no inferiority complex,
since this itself is a subtle form of pride.
The mind must seek to know and to judge, but to
judge for service, not to sit in judgment upon others.
This form of Yoga, as indeed all other forms of Yoga,
is
emphatically a Yoga of Service, for the very reason that
it is a Yoga of Union, and he who seeks only to gain and
not to give will soon find that, far from gaining, he is
beginning to lose that which he already has.

Effort, Right Mmdfulness, Right Concentration." The Word of the Buddha,

purely personal advantage. It is
right that he should unfold
his own Divine Life, but he must ever remember that only as
he shares, may he retain, and gain. It has been said : Seek,
Find, Share. These are indeed the true processes of Yoga,
and if we omit the last, the time will come when we shall
neither seek nor find.
It is
perhaps useful to realize that all true Yoga is a
form of bombardment of the smaller self by the Larger, of
the less by the More, of the individual by the Universal, of
manhood by Godhead, or of man by Superman.
Where there is weakness this will be intensified.
Where there is
strength this will be intensified. That which
can be shattered will be shattered. That which can be
refined will be refined. That which can be broken into
pieces will be broken into pieces. That which can be made
whole will be made whole.
An individual who indulges in physical self-satisfactions,
which intensify the physical nature, may tend to find himself
breaking to pieces under the powerful bombardment of
finer and therefore stronger influences.
He is in fact setting up physical targets which will be
in danger of being blown to pieces. And if he sets up
similar targets in the realm of feelings and emotions, he is
subjecting himself to an even fiercer bombardment. It is
impossible simultaneously to serve both God and Mammon,
until we have experienced them as one.
This yogic bombardment is
precisely like those bom-
bardments with which science deals in its transmutation of
the elements. It is for release, for the release of nature's
finer forces. Clearly, therefore, the more we intensify the
resistance, the more difficult will become the release, the
more certainty of a grave injury to tissues instead of an
easy forthflowing.

successful, you may possibly be able to begin exercises in
this form of Yoga, provided it is
entirely congenial to you.
But you are heading straight for disaster if
you ignore all
warnings and neglect all precautions.
Imagine the effect upon an individual who took part
in a boat-race, involving a tremendous strain, without any
athletic training beforehand !
I must also point out that those who are already en-
gaged in some form of Yoga, or who are already members
of an Esoteric School, must not add this Yoga to their
exercises without consultation with the heads of their
schools. Yogas must on no account be mixed, or each
will not only fail to produce the designed result, but an
unbearable strain will eventuate in wrecking physical and
other health.
It was my original intention to publish a number of
diagrams, illustrating my conceptions of the symbols in this
form of Symbolic Yoga. But I have been advised that so
to do would largely frustrate the object I have in view of
moving my readers to make their own discoveries without
the hindrance of static forms, to which there would be a
conscious, or even an unconscious, tendency to conform.
I have described my own vision of the seven symbols,
and, as the reader will see, in Book Five (article on
"
Syrpbols through the Kingdoms "), there are very close
correspondences between these visions of the macrocosmic
and the microcosmic processes of incarnation. On the
other hand, each one of us must manufacture his own
Yoga for himself within the laws of the Science. He may
perceive other symbols, or he may perceive these very
symbols otherwise. In any case, I must not unduly influence
him as I should be doing were I to make static that which
is above all dynamic, flowing, restless, changeful.
It is well, indeed, that the reader should decide that
my descriptions are vague and without clear definition. In
54 THE VIGIL OF PURIFICATION
this way, he will feel that they are free from hard precision,
and what is even more important, will feel himself free
from all
imposition of authority.
Far from presuming to be in any way authoritative, it is
no more than an experience very carefully observed over a
considerable period of time. And it is intended only to
stir to their own experiences those who so desire.
Gossamer | am also anxious that readers of this book shall not
fall into the mistake of regarding the seven symbols as a
series of solids, as, for example, the Platonic
"
solids,"
l
which I
very much wish were not called solids at all, as by
those with occult vision they are said to be but lines of
force.
The symbols shown to me are much more in the
nature of patterns, each as web-like as is the Web that is
the Womb, or of Line-curves. They are among the Thought-
Forms of a God, and possess that indefinable delicacy yet
precision of texture which characterizes the higher regions
of consciousness.
They are multi-dimensional, and transcend all confine-
ment within two or three. They may be most imperfectly
sketched on a piece of paper, but the true student will only
use such a sketch as a starting-point, whence he unfolds
the sketch-note into a symphony of sound and colour
and form.
I
hope I shall not be misunderstood if I
explain that
these symbols are so real may I
say
" so solid
"
? that
they have a delicacy, a fineness, a gossamer quality, and
therefore a power, all of which lose their intensity as their
substance but not, of course, their substans increasingly
1 "
. . . the five Platonic solids, the only regular polygons possible in
geometry ... are given in a fixed series, and this series agrees with the
different planes of the solar system. Each of them indicates not the form of
the atoms of the different planes, but the lines along which the power works
which surrounds those atoms These polygons are the tetrahedron, the cube,
the octahedron, the dodecahedron and the icosahedron If we put the point
at one end and the sphere at the other, we get a set of seven figures,
corresponding to the number of planes in our solar system." -C. W. Lead-
beater, Trie Inner Life, Vol. 1
PROLOGUE 55
assumes the texture of circumferences receding from the
Centre. Furthermore, these symbols are so perfectly rest-
less that they seem to bfe, and are, in a state of perfect
rest. Perfect rest involves no-rest, as perfect no-rest
involves rest.
But let me also warn the reader that almost inevitably
he will look upon the symbols I have sought to describe
through the coloured lens of his individuality, as I
myself
have necessarily done. I have tried to be as impersonal as
I could with due regard to a certain amount of clarity. But
the reader must guard himself as far as he can both
against my personal equation and against his own.
I believe my experiences to be substantially in accord
with the trend of the deepest philosophic thought as ex-
pressed, for example, in what is called Theosophy. But I
make no apology even where this is not the case. Rather
than to be orthodox and conformatory, I have sought to be
myself, and to give my experience as I have encountered it,
constantly verifying the accuracy of my transcription, rather
than its
conformity with what has been written in books,
albeit these have been compiled by those infinitely wiser
than myself.
I have always had the conviction that the whole pur-
pose of the revelation of the Science of Theosophy is to
help people to find their own Theosophies, by no means
mere reproductions of those works in which the revelation
first found utterance in the modern world.
So, in publishing this Study in Symbolic Yoga, I am
but disclosing a colour-sound-form in my own life, believing
that there will be many who will be encouraged to find
complementary colour-sound-forms in theirs.

56 THE VIGIL OF PURIFICATION
Besant ; I here reproduce, echoing them most heartily,
her inimitable descriptions in this regard :
"It is
hafdly possible to take up a more difficult and
obscure subject
l
than that chosen for this morning, and I
have been trying to think of the best way in which to put
it before you. I have been urged to explain it, to give
some idea of what we mean by this constantly repeated
term, and I will try to make it more intelligible. But it is
very difficult, for there is so much of sight, which is then
mixed up by the seer with the thoughts within his own mind.
I have been trying as hard as possible to separate off these
elements by observing my own consciousness, and I will try
to describe what is seen, and to separate it off from what
is
thought in connection with what is seen, so that, to some
extent at least, I shall put before you separately the vision
which is observed, and the deductions drawn from it
by
the mystic.
" Now as a rule this is not done, and what you are
given by the seer, by the mystic, is a mixture. The person
who has the vision pours it all out what he sees, what he
thinks, what he puts into the vision all in one stream.
Obviously you cannot disentangle it ;
you have no means
of distinguishing clearly what he has seen, and what he has
thought ;
only the man himself can do it.
" I found the process more difficult than I
expected
when I
began to try to do it. I am not sure even now
that I shall not convey to you more confusion than the ulti-
mate clearness I
myself obtained in the matter. For it is
hard to translate the experience of one plane into a
language belonging to another, and the word which is
seized on, as the nearest equivalent on the physical plane
for that which is seen on the higher, is more often mislead-
ing than illuminative, because of its connotations, all of
which are, naturally, plunged into it
by the hearer. The
1 "

PROLOGUE 57
things that colour one's own ideas most are the hardest to
put into words, because this colour is often due to a sens-
ing of something beyond, which is too subtle to be seen,
and is not on the plane where the mind definitely outlines
the thought which it is
taking into intelligible form which it
can comprehend. There is a difference, in that there are
some things that you sense, but while you sense them you
do not see their outline, so that you get rather a sensing
than a thought, still less a thought-form.
"
These three elements are present, as factors in the
vision of the mystic, but they are not, as a rule, recognized
by him as factors :
" 1 . That which is looked at, the fact on another plane.
"2. That which is read into the fact by the thought
of the seer, by the previous experience he has gathered,
largely on the physical plane, and which is the normal
content of his consciousness.
" 3. That which he senses beyond his thinking, beyond
his sight, beyond his possibility of putting into clear
thought, much less clear language."
The element of incompleteness in all that one sees or
hears or otherwise contacts on these higher planes of
consciousness is
again mentioned by Dr. Besant in a pamphlet
entitled Investigations into the Super-physical.* In part
she says :
"
Things change in appearance as the power of vision
increases. A globe is seen, and one calls it a globe. Later
on, one finds that it is not a globe, but the physical end of
a form composed of higher kinds of matter. Down here the
solar system consists of globes rolling in their orbits round
a central sun. From a higher plane the solar system looks
like a lotus flower, its petals spread in space, its
golden
centre the sun, and the tip of each petal a world. Was
one wrong to speak of a world as a globe ? No ; it is true
1
Adyar Pamphlet 36.
58 THE VIGIL OF PURIFICATION
on the physical plane. But later, one sees things differently.
We see things down here as we might see a picture through
holes in a veil which covers it ;
through the holes we see
patches of colour ; remove the veil, and the patches are
part of a garment, of a hand, of a face. Alas ! our senses
shut out more than they reveal ;
they are holes in the wall
which imprisons our perceptive power. They often deceive
us ; but such as they are, with all their defects, we must
make the best of them. Even talc windows in a wall are
better than none,
" Let me take as an example the investigations made
into the atoms by Mr. Leadbeater and myself, in 1895
and in 1907-08. In 1895 we said that the ultimate
physical atom disintegrated into astral matter. That was
what we saw. In 1 907-08, using other sight, we found
that between the ultimate physical atom and its appearance
as astral matter, a whole series of changes intervened, a
series of disintegrations into ultimate bubbles in aether, and
of integrations back to astral matter. The case is analo-
gous to the study of an object under the lower and higher
powers of a microscope. You look at it
through a low
power and describe it ;
say, that you see little
separate
particles, and that you so describe them in your record of
your observation. You put on a higher power ;
you dis-
cover that little threads of matter, too fine to be visible
under the lower power, link the particles together into a
chain. The first record can hardly be said to be wrong ;
it recorded accurately what was seen under the low power,
the appearance presented by the object. All vision can
only tell of appearances, and we may always be sure that
its records are imperfect. We enlarge our perceptions
as we ascend from one plane to another, and gain a
completer view of each object.

| cannot too strongly warn readers of this book
against in any way lightly undertaking the practice
of Yoga.
As I
constantly endeavour to point out, Yoga is a
definite act of dedication, of consecration, and both the
slightest of selfish motives and, still more, any insincerity
or lightness of attitude will recoil dangerously upon anyone
thus animated.
Even to copy Yoga is
dangerous. To copy the Yoga
of another is as futile as to imagine for a single moment
that a copy of a work of art is as good as the original
masterpiece. The masterpiece has genius, whatever be
its defects, while a copy of it cannot even be faithful, for
not only is it unable to reproduce the genius, it is
equally
unable to reproduce those very so-called defects, those
60 THE VIGIL OF PURIFICATION
excursions outside the conventional, the orthodox, the
accepted, which themselves are signs of the expression of
the genius.
If
any reader sets out just to copy the details of my
Yoga theme, trying to repeat them in himself, regardless
of his essential difference from myself, he is not yet ready
for Yoga. If, on the other hand, he uses my experiences
to stimulate his own Yoga, not copying my Yoga but setting
about the construction of a Yoga of his own, then will he
derive profit from what I have written. He is
ready for
Yoga, and it
may well be safe for him, right for him, to
relate somewhat of my theme to his own symphony.
In Yoga a very definite measure of originality is vital,
for the Science of Yoga is such that it most remarkably
adapts itself to each individual's uniqueness.
I do not ask any reader to judge my book by the
extent to which it has external corroboration, but by his
own awakened or awakening intuition, by the measure of
his own independence and freedom from imprisoning
orthodoxies.
And since I
quote somewhat extensively from that
Book of books, The Secret Doctrine, I would say to its
devotees, among whom I count myself, that only as there is
arising within us our own Secret Doctrine, our own unique
Secret Doctrine, can we hope to give full measure of value
to The Secret Doctrine.
Only as we are beginning to hear the Voice of our
own silence, shall we be able to understand The Voice of
the Silence ;
only as is
flowering within us the Doctrine of
our own heart, shall we be able to enter into the spirit of
The Doctrine of the Heart ;
only as Light is
beginning to
dawn upon our own pathway, shall we be able to know
Light on the Path.
Only as the God within awakens, shall we hear the
Call of God without.

In these days of the Kali Yuga,
*
the Science of Yoga
has become degraded, so that the Kingly or Raja Yoga has
become obscured by that Hatha Yoga which once was the
servant of the King, but now is so often his tyrant. Western
dabblers in Yoga reach but this Hatha Yoga in its present
extravagance, and think that they have entered into the
sanctum sanctorum of Yoga because their teachers can
perform tricks. There can be no true Hatha Yoga without
Raja Yoga.'
In India today, save in remote regions inaccessible to
the curious, little of the real Science survives, for most
seekers of modern times seek for themselves, for their self-
glorification, for their salvation, concern themselves little
with the liberation of the world, and fancy that they can
live as the outer world lives and at the same time be
students of the Science of Yoga.
Infinitely more lies hidden in the real India than man
shall know for many a century to come.
In discussing this question of the trend of the western
world in the direction of psychism and pseudo-Yoga
practices, forsaking the glorious path that leads to true
Yoga Spirituality I can do no better than quote to you

the line of demarcation as defined by one of the greatest
Yogis of the age Dr. Annie Besant :
"
Psychism is the improvement of mechanism, of
apparatus, not of spiritual power."
]
She then declares that
Spirituality is not a mere "
recognition of the unity, but a
realization of the unity.
" To realize the unity is for each of you to live in all
forms, and not only in your own, to feel yourselves as suf-
fering with the starvation of the starving, with the degrada-
tion of the degraded, to feel the sin of the sinner to be
your sin, the misery of the miserable to be your misery
. . .
Psychism comes by knowledge. Spirituality comes
by love. To know the One, to feel the One, to realize
the One, that is
spirituality. But it means that you see no
difference between yourself and others. It means that
you identify yourself with every living thing. That is
spirituality and nothing less. Such has been the teaching
of every great spiritual man who has lived in this lower
world. There is no separation for the man who lives in
the spirit . . . There is no such thing as indignation that
can move the spirit who sees himself only, and cannot be
indignant because all is himself. Righteous indignation is a
valuable thing. Why ? Because men are not strong enough
to come in contact with evil, and not have some desire to
follow it ... It is
necessary for the weak. You are not
yet strong enough to be spiritual without peril to your own
goodness. . . .
" The spiritual state ... is
only valuable as it
purifies
the soils of those around ... If
you are pure, your purity
is not yours for separation ; it is
yours for sharing that all
may become pure . . . There is no solitary salvation ;.
there is no individual .salvation. A man is saved as all are
saved, and salvation for some only would not be worth
accepting. . . .

THE YOGA OF ACCELERATION 63
Acceleration
and Retardation
Pseudo-Yoga
"How wide then the difference between psychism
and spirituality ! How vast the difference. Both are good.
Both have their use. Both ultimately must join in the per-
fect man."
To no small extent is this form of Yoga designed to
help all who are in danger of becoming detached from
their due rate of growing at that stage in human evolution
which they have so far attained.
It is one of the peculiar dangers of the Kali Yuga in
the human kingdom that, with the tendency to acceleration
associated with the higher regions of the kingdom, there is
intensified in an equal and opposite direction the tendency
to retardation, so that the injunction in / Corinthians, X, 12 :
" Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall,"
has very special significance.
And one of the most remarkable features of the
forces of retardation is that they seem, at all events at first
sight, not only to differ very little from the forces of
acceleration, but to offer much more.
In America, where on the one hand there are obvi-
ously at work a large number of forces for acceleration
naturally so when we look into the foundations of the
American organism there are also an equal and opposite
number of retardatory forces, specially in evidence in the
forms of secret societies, occult practice courses, and
individuals blatantly making the most extravagant claims as
to their exclusive relations with the Highest Beings.
It would be curious that so many people allow
themselves to be deceived by these definitely evil activities
working for the retardation of progress, were not such
proneness to deception a characteristic of a people vital
with the spirit of youth and challenge, and almost recklessly
eager to give trust to any who are clever enough to
surround themselves with plausible atmospheres of deep
mystery and magic, and of intimate and sole confidence on

the part of Personages about whom they are able to talk
and write glibly, because they have read about them in
Theosophical literature. The hall-mark of these un-
fortunate deluders, indeed self-deluders no less than
deluders of others, is
generally their claim to unique
messengership a word they would probably spell with a
capital
" M."
Under such influences the unfortunate dupe, however
admirable his intentions, steps out of his normal and natural
rhythm, and definitely retards his progress ; and it
may
take him some incarnations before he is able to disentangle
himself from the pseudo-spiritual slime with which he has
allowed himself to be permeated.
California, by very reason of her splendid facilities for
spiritual acceleration, unequalled by any other part of the
United States, must needs be specially afflicted by these
noxious forces. But only those who have not yet learned
to enter into the spirit of California, however long they
may have resided in the State, are in any danger of
becoming enslaved by them. The whole atmosphere
of California is a fragrant and vital safeguard, if.
only
Californians will learn to breathe it in its
purity and
beauty.
England has not to face those forces of retardation
which find fruitful soil in America. Her danger lies in those
elements which make for the domination of the static, of
self-satisfaction, indeed of self-righteousness. England's
greatness is, of course, in those very virtues of acceleration
to which these weaknesses of retardation are complementary.
England's note is
stability, as America's is quest. But just
as quest may degenerate into greed, so may stability
degenerate into pride.
My thoughts naturally turn also to India, which, like all
other countries, is twofold in her nature. America is the
America of Lincoln and Washington as well as the country

she is
today. England I am specifically omitting refer-
ence to her three sister-nations is the England of Elizabeth

India is the India of the Rishis as well as the India ol
today. To each country are its foundations, and the struc-
tures built upon these, some enduring, some but whims oi
fleeting moods.
India's strength lies in her eternal reality. Her weak-
ness lies in the prostitution of this reality to modern fashion,
whether in politics, in religion, in education, in industry
in her arts and crafts, or even in the daily living of hei
peoples.
There are those in India today, as there are others ir
every other country, who seek to make their country <
slave of some other country's soul, instead of a Holy Grai
for her own soul. They look everywhere but at thei
Motherland, and seek her redemption everywhere but ir
her own heart.
This Symbolic Yoga is to help all to remember whena
they have come, who they indeed are, and whithe
they are wending their individual, but no less collect
ive, ways.
It is to help them to enter into their great Memories
that they may remember what manner of Men they are
and how they are Gods no less.
It is to help them to tread their ways more quickly bj
bringing into their daily lives, simply, without strain, bu
piercingly, some of the great Formulae of Life, some of the
great Mnemonics of Living.
It is to help them to guard against the temptations o
the forces of retardation, subtle and insidiously attractive
as these needs must be, by giving them opportunities con-
stantly to hold before themselves Truths which are in fad
within them, are theirs already, only needing reminders ol
their existence.
66 THE VIGIL OF PURIFICATION
Yoga is Life This Symbolic Yoga is therefore Life, to be fashioned
into images reflecting the highest individuality of each of its
students. If it be displayed in the forms I have described,
it is only because I saw this Yoga in such forms, perhaps
because they are mine, but also because every great
Science of Life from time immemorial has borne witness to
their reality.
The Symbols They are mine because they are real. I think they
belong to all for the same reason. But there may be some
who think they see other forms.
Let not any form be an obstacle to the Life, or to
that Yoga whereby the Life may shine forth in each of us
more gloriously.

A Further
Dipping-down
The reward, which a man obtains in the Krita age by
abstract meditation, in the Treta by sacrifice, in the Dvapara by
adoration, he receives in the Kali Yuga by merely reciting the
names of Keshava. Vishnupuranam, VI, 2
Reference has been made to the various Ages through,
which Man passes, and particularly to the Kali Yuga in which
for the moment he finds himself.
The Krita Yuga would seem to be the Age of Inno-
cence, in the sense of its being the first step in the evolu-
tionary process, when life is mothered by the Giver of Life.
This mothering is clearly noticeable in the earlier
kingdoms of nature, but is also to be observed in the
human kingdom itself, at such time as the Giver of Life
establishes on earth the standards for humanity.
In the course of the Treta Yuga, which is the Second
Age of the world, as well as of a particular kingdom of
nature, there is a period during which Man, in every king-
dom of his uprising, comes into his own, which is to say, he
starts on the process of fulfilling the standards established for
him in every kingdom of nature during its Krita or Satya Yuga.
The Higher Gods would seem almost to recede into
the background, thus forcing Man back upon his own
Godhead, such as is appropriate to the kingdom of nature
through which he is
passing.
The Dvapara Yuga is a further unfoldment of the
Krita Yuga, a further dipping -down into matter under the
Law of Adjustment.

Shorter and
Longer Yugas
The Kali Yuga is the lowest point in such dipping-
down. It is the period in which Man is
beginning to
know himself as Man, but not yet to know himself as God.
Therefore, it is
inevitably a Yuga of strife, of friction.
But from the Kali Yuga there is the beginning of an
ascent into a Dvapara Yuga, with ascent and not descent
characteristics.
Thence man passes upwards into the Treta Yuga, with
ascent and not descent characteristics.
Finally, there is entry into the Satya Yuga, when Man be-
comes Self-conscious of his Divinity on every plane, inasmuch
as he brings every plane of nature with him to the consumma-
tion of Divinity, with the result that every plane becomes
divine.
The symbology of the Krita or Satya Yuga as having
" four points," the Treta Yuga as having three, the Dva-
para as having two, and the Kali Yuga as having one point,
indicates the nearness of each Yuga to the Centre. The
Krita or Satya Yuga has four points of nearness, the Treta
Yuga three, the Dvapara two, and the Kali Yuga only
one point.
In each Yuga, of course, all four stages are inherent,
but while on the downward arc, unconsciousness dominates.
In the Kali Yuga Self-consciousness begins to be definitely
developed, and when the turning-point of the Kali Yuga is
passed, there is ascent in ever-increasing Self-consciousness
'into each of the higher Yugas, Dvapara, Treta, and finally
Krita or Satya.
It is
very difficult to understand clearly the distinction
between the unconsciousness on the downward arc and the
Self-consciousness on the upward arc, for even conscious-
ness on its downward progress positively grows through its
descent into Yuga after Yuga. However this may be, it
seems obvious that the more sublime Yugas are longer
than the Kali Yuga which is
likely to be the shortest of all
YUGAS AND YOGA 69

the Yugas. It
may well be that in the higher Yugas, as
consciousness descends, the rate of movement is slower.
It may well be that in the Kali Yuga a tremendous amount
of movement is
compressed within a very short space of
time. Furthermore, we may speak of an increasing
acceleration in and after the Kali Yuga. In any event
the limits of the duration of a Yuga cannot be arbitrarily
fixed. As Madame Blavatsky has so rightly stated :
"Cycles and epochs depend on consciousness . . .
Cycles
are measured by the consciousness of humanity and not
by Nature."
1
These Yugas are not merely world -periods, or
macrocosmic, but are also periods of microcosmic evolution.
I have the impression that we could establish these Yugas
in every living creature. I think that the childhood of man
corresponds to the Satya or Krita Yuga, his youth to the
Treta Yuga, his adolescence to the Dvapara Yuga, and his
years up to middle age, or somewhat beyond, to the
Kali Yuga. From that turning-point, he should be facing
homewards, and as the years pass from middle to old age,
he should rapidly pass, through the Dvapara and Treta
Yugas, to that Satya Yuga entry to which is
given through
the door of death.
There would seem to be a Krita or Satya Yuga in the
very beginning of the evolutionary process, also for each
wave of life as it animates a kingdom of nature, after a
previous life-wave has passed from that kingdom. I seem
to see a Satya Yuga for every kingdom of nature, as we'l
as all the other Yugas.
If I am at all
right in this, then we do not look upon
the Kali Yuga
2
in any sense as a futile age, or as an age
in which Man dwells in the midst of innumerable adverse

forces. Rather is it an age in which Man establishes his
mastery at the very frontiers of his evolutionary process.
Triumphing at its frontiers, he turns his face homewards
with the "
spoils
"
of his righteous war.
I am inclined to think that as Yuga succeeds Yuga, so
does the Eternal Truth descend more and more into
symbols. In this Kali Yuga the symbol-note must be at its
height, for Men, not yet being able to know Truth face to
face, must know it as through a symbol, darkly. This form
of Yoga is
specially for the Kali Yuga.
I can well imagine that in the Satya Yuga there was no
need for symbols, since Truth walked freely abroad, and the
eyes of the then Men were veiled from the excess of
its glory. Men were but children in their glorious and
eternal home.
Then, in the Yuga following, they began their youth,
preparing to journey forth towards the farthest distances of
consciousness. In the first
Yuga ". . . the Builders,
having donned their first Clothing, descend on radiant
Earth and reign over Men who are themselves," says the
seventh Stanza of Dzyan. But the time came when Heroes
must take the place of Gods, and Men must learn to walk
alone. So in the succeeding Age, still further do Men
wander away from their unconsciousness that they may
become Self-conscious.
Symbols
1
accompany them, however, into these darker
regions, to be their memories of Truth. And in the
Kali Yuga, while Truth lives, most of it is veiled in
sym-
bol, and often in
allegory. And some Men gaze
upon the symbols, and see naught else, nor perceive in
words but the meanings of their actual forms. They see the
letter, and imagine in their darkness that it is the spirit, for
their eyes can measure but little
shining. So do they
become enslaved in forms and in authorities. So, be they

But there be other Men who'

are the jewels which foretell the Sun.
And the time comes when, gazing upon these jewel-

YOGA REAL AND UNREAL
The Way of
Holiness
Yoga is
Creative Unity
It is the life and not the knowledge, the purified heart,
not the well-filled head that leads us to our Master's Feet.
Annie Besant
At the outset of this Study in Symbolic Yoga I
must express the misgiving I feel with regard to its publica-
tion, partly because the Science of Yoga
1
is so intricate,
and partly because it is so individual.
True, indeed, in the deeper reaches of the great
religions of the world there always lies hidden the great
Truth of Transubstantiation, of Liberation, of Union, of
Samadhi,~ for the finding of those who know how to seek.
There always lies hidden the dangerously glorious Way of
Holiness,
3
of Purification, the short cut up the side of the
Mountain of Evolution, which those may tread who are
ready to tread it. In some of the great Scriptures, this
Truth and this Way have been marvellously described in
richest detail, notably in Hinduism, so that the Science of
their attainment is shown to be a matter of Law and of
obedience to Law.
Fortunately, however, for the modern world, the key
4
to the practice of Yoga, veritable science of creative unity,,
is most cleverly lost amidst the innumerable directions for

its
discovery, with the result that while the Science of Yoga
remains living today, its practice becomes automatically
restricted to those whose worthiness to know reveals to
them the way to knowledge.
On the other hand, the restlessness of the modern
world, and its instinctive urge to escape from greater into
lesser ignorance, causes an intense interest in a science
which seems to possess the power of lifting its votaries out
of the slough of their despond. And the result is both a
number of commentaries on the various systems of Yoga,
on the part of those who seek to translate into English
scientific terms which they do not themselves really under-
stand, and for which the English language has no equival-
ents whatever ; and a number of books written by credu-
lous foreigners, who think they are encountering Yogis when
at the most they are but watching conjuring tricks.
In some parts of the world, too, there is a flood of
pseudo-occult literature, which is as mischievous as it is
false, and some are so foolish as to believe that for the
payment of a sum of money the principles of Yoga may
be acquired !
It cannot be too clearly stated that no one can be-
come a Yogi with the Yoga of another, nor as he studies
and strives to practise the laws of Yoga as these may
be set forth in those Scriptures especially dealing with
Yoga. The great principles of Yoga may well be of uni-
versal validity. But they have an infinite variety of appli-
cation as they descend into the individual uniqueness of
each seeker. And while the effective study of Yoga may
need a teacher as well as the observance of certain laws
of the Science, all that the teacher can do is through his
own Yoga to evoke the Yoga of his pupil, while all that
the Law can do is to help the traveller on his way, and to
protect him against the dangers which must needs beset
him as he travels.
74 THE VIGIL OF PURIFICATION
The Eternal
Alphabet of
Yoga
Your Yoga is

Distortions of
Yoga
Any book on Yoga, therefore, can at best stir in the
earnest student that spirit of Yoga which, dwelling within
himself, he will have to pour into forms constructed in
terms of his own genius and fundamental distinctiveness.
There is, I am sure, but one eternal alphabet of Yoga, but
each one of us must learn to write and pronounce its
letters differently, so that out of the one alphabet emerge
innumerable forms and sounds, each different from all the
rest. One Truth, many truths. One Law, many laws.
The Yoga of the Lord of this universe in which we live and
move and have our being is
unique to this universe, and
different from the Yogas of all other universes.
I
regard these notes, therefore, not as a guide to the
practice of a certain form of Yoga, though they may be
such if the student wishes to use them as a stepping-stone
to his own true Yoga, but more particularly as a stimulus to
the discovery by each earnest and truly enquiring student of
his own unique Yoga, different as this must be from my
own if his discovery be true.
It is most unfortunate that an impression prevails
that Yoga means the attainment of what are called psychic
powers, and that it is conceived to that end. The im-
pression also prevails 'that certain physical practices,
together with certain vague concentrations, heralded by no
particular vigil or preparation, will cause such powers to
issue forth, so that the practice of "
Yoga
"
tends in these
days to become a kind of hobby for all and sundry, an
amusement for the leisure hours, to be undertaken without
any of that arduous and prolonged training which is known
by genuine students to be essential to the development of
those forces which build lofty character and truly spiritual
stature, and all the power that comes therewith.

THE YOGA OF THE INDIVIDUAL
Western and
Eastern Bodies
The Fragrance
of Experience
One vision differs from another, not because the Reality
as such is different, but because it is viewed from a different level,
height or story of the tower of spiritual evolution.
B. L Atreya
That which is set forth in these pages is the result of
much study and experiment during many years, with a
further clarification from certain special facilities which have
come my way. A western body is indeed ill-equipped to
stand the strain of the venturesomeness required for
successful experiment. It has neither the heredity nor the
purity of the average eastern body, so essential to the
undertaking of what is often a forlorn hope. I
have,
however, lived for over thirty years in India, and what is
far more important, in the spirit of India, seeking India's
eternal life. This has, perhaps, offset my various physical
disadvantages, and I have had the gracious help of One
who is indeed a Lord of Yoga. Little could I understand
of His mighty sweeps of power-release. But through His
magic my own Yoga stirred within me, and these notes are
the result.
I am telling you all I can about experiences which to
me have been, are, and doubtless will ever be, of
tremendous import, the more so because as I
grow, the
experiences will unfold too. I am telling you about the
symbols which embody the experiences, which epitomize
the experiences, and which point out to me to what

further heights and depths they lead. I am telling you of
the fragrances, of the illuminations, of the inspirations, of
the release, which accompany these experiences. And I am
not hesitating to suggest to you that, perchance, these
experiences may have some kind of counterpart in your
own growings.
But I want to insist and insist and insist that all anyone
can do by way of helping is to knock at the door of your
life with his, not to ask you to open the door to receive
his life, but to open the door to release your own.
We knock. You open not to admit from without,
but rather to release from within.
As I am sure you will perceive, the symbols that have
crystallized my own wanderings into the realms of Yoga are

very well known to all students of the Real.
They are by no means new. On the contrary, I have good
reason to believe that they exist from eternity to eternity.
Before time, they were. Before space. For they are
among a marvellous range of formulae into which He who
transcends all time and space, who is No-Life because sa
infinitely more than all Life, who is No- Being because so
infinitely more than Being, may breathe His No-Lightning
for their infinite expansion.
That they are vital and fundamental I have no doubt
whatever. But my interpretation is
my own. My under-
standing is
my own. My experience is
my own. That
which they are to me I have set forth. To such of
them as you may feel attracted by the Law of Gravi-
tation as it works within you, you should use for the
building of your own Yoga. But you must build in the
light of your spirit, and not in that of mine. A number

many trees, as there are artists, even if there be but One
Tree. So will there be many Yogas, each the supreme
object of devotion to its true votary, and yet only One Yoga.
In the One Yoga seek your own, and In it find
the One.
I desire likewise to stress the fact that these great
symbols of Symbolic Yoga will appear differently as they
are studied by different types of consciousness :
I have watched a mathematician examine them in
the light of his particular science, and I could see, without
comprehending, how, in some high branch of mathematics,
he was able to reduce each symbol to a great mathemat-
ical formula. The result to him was a series of abstruse
formulae which, as it were, epitomized for him the
whole universe. As Einstein so truly remarks, for all
real study and experiment, the faculty of the imagination
is essential, and I can see clearly how he himself
bridged his gulfs with the help of his own sparkling and
creative imagination. I could see also how this particular
mathematician used his imagination to construct bridges
over gulfs, and then looked to see if he had really reached
the other side, that is to say, another side which satisfied
his other faculties. The difficulty with the scientist is
not in the beginning nor in the end, but in between.
When Science knows how to make a bridge, Science
is
complete.
It was the same with an artist, He translated each
symbol into forms and colours, into such forms and colours
as impinged most closely upon their archetypes. The result
was a series of colour-forms, each kaleidoscopically emerg-
ing from its predecessor, and summing up the colour-and-
form scheme of the whole evolutionary process. He had
his formula, but in terms of colour and form.
So was it with a musician, working in terms of sound
as the artist worked in terms of light.
78 THE VIGIL OF PURIFICATION
The musician made an archetypal note for each symbol,
and elaborated it in the heaven world where there are no
restrictions. It is
glorious to watch a great composer go
into the heaven world of music, and bring down the symbol
in his own particular way. Wagner, for example, brings
down a globule of music, and the lower it
gets, the more
it tends to burst. At last it bursts in his own individual
heaven world, and then the symphony, the opera, and all
the scintillations of the rainbow effect of music are produced.
Follow an opera or symphony back, and it becomes the
Point. It is a very wonderful thing to reduce any piece of
music to its Point significance. Can you reduce a Raga to
one vibration, only one? The musician does. So does the
master of form, as such. You have a colour alphabet, a
sound alphabet, a fragrance alphabet, and you have also a
form alphabet.
All Things to So will it be with every student ; and you will, lam
All Students , f .
, ,
sure, see how glorifying these symbols must become when
translated into those vibrations which the student can most
readily use in the outer world. Even if he cannot express here
that which he can shape there, the inspiration of his achieve-
ments in the realms of more sensitive substance is bound to
flow down into these regions of comparative inelasticity,
and give the worker what we call genius, heroism, or saint-
hood, according to his mode of expression.
For my own part I have tried to be as impersonal
as I could, so as not to interpose my own individuality be-
tween the symbols and my readers.

THE ULTIMATES OF LIFE
The Real
Purpose of this
Yoga
Planting the End
into the Way
Within Thy Form, O God, the Gods I
see,
All grades of beings with distinctive marks.
The Bhagavad G/ta, XI, 15.
This particular research into Yoga has not been for the
purpose of acquiring what are normally called miraculous
powers, nor for the intimate practice of withdrawal from,
various intervening states of consciousness, as set forth in
most works of Yoga.
This Yoga is for the purpose of striving to gain some
direct impression of some of what may perhaps be called,
without undue impertinence, the Ultimates of Life, of the
fundamental Ultimates of Being, and of the evolutionary
process itself.
If in some way we can plant the end into the actual
way, that will vivify the way. From cosmic regions the
Lords of the Flame, certain Ultimates of Evolution, descended
right down into our poor little evolutionary process. The
Ultimates descended down into the actuals. This, on an
infinitely smaller scale, is the descent of Ultimates, as ex-
pressed in Symbols, down into the human kingdom, not
only for general uplift, but to try to stem the tide of
pseudo-occultism which is rife in so many directions, and
which is
gaining more and more ascendency in certain parts
of the world. If we can in some poor way bring down
even the vaguest shadowy conceptions of certain Ultimates,
and plant them in the world in the hearts of men who are

ready to receive them, then perchance good will be done,
even though the world cannot be restrained, I
fear, from
some of the disasters which have to follow the causes of
which they are effects.
Of course, I have no business whatever to write of
"
Ultimates." What can I know of such ? But for the fact
that in myself I know I am an Ultimate, the very use of
such a word is
impertinent conceit. So, if I use it at
all, it is
only to represent the farthest states of conscious-
ness I can perceive I do not say
"

"
with the help
of a Lord of Yoga who lifts me up into His Mount of
Transcendence for more extended vision. I see in the
farthest distance a mighty range of Mountain-Symbols. I
have perceived their substance-shadows in my very self. I
record all I have been able to understand of this illumined
Vision of the Real.
I descend from the Mount of His Transcendence into
the valley of my endeavour. And I seek the way to climb
to my own Transcendence, again to gaze upon the range
of distant Mountain-Symbols, and to find my way to them,
the Home whence I have come.

How to climb ? How to gaze ? How to move upon
the splendid way ?
By withdrawal from state after state of conscious-
ness, as seems to be described in some of the works
on Yoga ?
Is it
by leaving behind that I shall climb more lightly,
see more clearly, move more easily?
No, not so has it seemed to me in the beginning, not
so has it seemed to me since. Indeed must I enter into
the great stillnesses of Mountains, into their sublime power
and purpose. Indeed must my eyes my inner and spirit-
ual eyes become infinitely far-seeing. They must become
as the eyes of those who gaze into distances, and perceive
that which those cannot see who look but a short way before
them. They must see beyond the visible into the invisible.
They must become the calm, deep eyes, reflecting pools of
great Silences, so still that I
hardly know whether I am
looking upon a substance or a shadow.
I must move onwards into the stillnesses of growing
nature, each stirring of a leaf, each hum of an insect, each
note of a bird, each breath of a breeze, each drop of the
rain, even the menace-notes of wild animals and rumblings
of storms all together but intensifying the stillness so deep

with sound. I must move onwards and then upwards
into the range of Mountain-Symbols, where I shall find
all Sounds, all Colours, all Stillnesses, all Silence, all
Darkness.
Shall I achieve all this by relinquishment ? Shall I
reach the summits by casting away ? Not by deadening,
not by discarding, not by withdrawing, do we achieve the
means to rise to the heights of our predestined end, but
by refining, by making each molehill of experience a
mountain of triumph.
Not by killing, not by dying, not by withdrawing, do
we achieve life eternal, but by intensifying living to the
utmost of its
glory.
If we die, it is because we have not yet learned how
to live. If we kill, it is because we have not yet learned
how to cherish. If we withdraw, it is because we have not
yet learned how to include. Dying, killing, withdrawing
these are but substitutes for the life we have yet
to find.
So is it that, in this form of Yoga, we move on our
way by fulfilling, by sublimating, by performing those acts
of transubstantiation which are the reflections in the outer
worlds of the real acts of transubstantiation in the inner.
The true withdrawal of Yoga is the power to take everything
with us on our journeyings, leaving nothing whatever be-
hind. Yoga is for the expansion and filling of consciousness,
for the refining and purifying of consciousness, for the
universalizing of consciousness, for the helping of men to
become Gods.
Yoga is the act of God who makes Men Gods.
The whole of Life, as we know it and even more as
we do not know it, is one perfect Yoga, and by the grace
of a God of Yoga, by the grace of a Supreme Ishvara, we
and all that lives and there is
nothing inorganic anywhere
are Yogis. We are unconscious Yogis in the Universal

l
until we enter the human kingdom and attain its
higher reaches.
Then do we begin to become self-conscious Yogis in
our unique individualities, thus preparing to fulfil at last the
high purpose of Him, who for ever and for ever has been,
calling to the Yoga within us with the compelling Voice,
Sublimity and Magic of His own.
So we see how from universal aspects of Yoga we
become individual aspects of Yoga, and then from the in-
dividual aspect of Yoga, from and by an act of Divine
Magic, once more we enter into the Universal with an
Individuality which we never lose. One of the most
glorious things to perceive, even at an infinite distance, is
the Great God as a Person. It is
infinitely comforting from
one point of view, and infinitely glorifying from another
point of view, to know that we shall never lose ourselves,,
nor can we ever lose those who are around us as com-
panions on our way.
Nowhere is there unreality. Everywhere Reality
shines forth in all its powers and potencies. Supremely
real must we become as the fruition of our evolutionary
way. So, as we undergo experience after experience, we
take them with us in their essence, in their fragrance, in.
their life.
To prepare for the Yoga which is our divine heritage
as well as the Crown of our future Glory, we must seek to
fulfil all things which concern us, causing each to become
as a jewel of our Coronation.

THE SCIENCE OF FULFILMENT
Yog
Fulfi
;a

The Voice of
God becomes
the Will of Man
Thou wouldst not seek for Me, unless
Thou hadst already found Me.
The Imitation of Christ
Yoga is not a Science of Negation. It is a Science of
Fulfilment. And only those are qualified to tread the
way who are constantly fulfilling both their virtues and their
weaknesses: Be it remembered that even our virtues are
but very partial expressions of their substances, and that
our weaknesses have their place in our unfolding.
To wallow or to indulge either in a virtue or in a weak-
ness I do not care to use the word "vice" is to
degrade it and not to fulfil it. It is as destructive to be
the slave of a virtue as of a weakness.
The would-be Yogi takes with him for his Yoga the
Will of God as expressed both through his weaknesses and
his virtues. In his weaknesses he will seek the Will of God
and fulfil it. In his virtues he will seek the Will of God
and fulfil it. There is no weakness which does not point
the way to strength, if
only we could see the pointing.
There is no strength which needs no further refining.
Where the would-be Yogi discovers in himself a weakness,
he will neither justify it nor continue to indulge in it. He
will face it, and demand to hear in it the Voice of God
calling to him.
If he hates, he will seek to listen to the Voice of God
speaking even in the hatred, and maybe he will be thankful
THE SCIENCE OF FULFILMENT 85
The Note of
this Yoga
The Lord of
Experience
to have hated in that he has thus learned the better how-
to love.
The Yogi will see, as no non-Yogi could see, in the
very hatred that overcomes him from time to time, "Yes,,
this teaches me the better how to love."
If he has passions, in them will he seek to listen to the
Voice of God calling him to awaken to their message to him.
If he has selfishnesses, in them will he seek to listen to
the Voice of God calling him to awaken to the message
they have for him.
If he has virtues, in them will he no less seek to listen
to the Voice of God calling him to awaken to their
message.
Everything is a message from God, from our Selves,
and when we realize and heed this, we are Yogis, whether
we are able to hold our breath or adopt this or that yogic
posture. We are the real Yogis who are needed in this
Kali Yuga more than at any other time.
So does the would-be Yogi, growing worthy to tread
the way to Yoga, hear in all
things the Voice of God, his
own voice as he shall someday know, and learn to sing his
song of victory.
To look our weaknesses in the face, and not to seek to
cast them off, is the particular note of this form of Yoga.
We listen to catch the note of the Divinity that they express
no less than virtue, so that in the midst of the darkness there
is always light, nothing but light. Darkness and Light are
relative terms. The greater the darkness the greater
the light.
The true Yogi is a master of all the circumstances
which ebb and flow through his life, even when they come
to him unbidden. The would-be Yogi seeks to ascend out
of slavery into kingship, so that he may rule instead of cir-
cumstances. And when, from time to time, he finds them to
be his masters, he summons to his aid his will, and with it faces.

subdues and moulds them. He may fail today, tomorrow
and the next day. But far greater than success is effort,
unceasing and undeviating. He who wins a race does well.
Better still does he who falls and loses, but picks himself up
to run again, undaunted.
We learn how to release God, our Self, in all things, and
to take Him with us everywhere. But only those who are
indeed on the threshold of the life of the Yogi are endowed
with the power of listening to the Voice of God in all
things, and of making the great release. All others must
still remain swayed by their experiences, often at their
mercy, often tossed about by them hither and thither,
needing their ministrations, and far too often revelling in
and justifying their reactions to them.
The would-be Yogi disentangles himself from crowds,
though perchance living in their midst in peaceful lone-
liness. Already is he glowing with the fire of his kingship,
even though not yet a king.
As we grow from the unconscious universalized Yoga,
in which life at its earlier stages evolves, into the conscious
individualized Yoga of the human kingdom, we pass
through innumerable experiences, every single one of which
is
necessary to our unfoldment, and the essence of which,
therefore, each one of us must take with him on his im-
mortal journey.
Each experience
!
on every plane, of whatever nature,
is a reflection of a reality on a plane within. Every form
we see around us is a reflection of the formless, as even
the formless itself is a reflection of the still more radiant.
Every virtue is a reflection of the Will of God, but so also,
and no less, is
every weakness.
So is it that the Yogi-to-be takes with him on
his return to the inner regions of life, in
awakening

Self-consciousness, a beautiful and perfect distillation of all
his experiences, as he identifies himself, becomes one, with
plane after plane
1
of nature. The very essence of each
plane becomes part of his own nature. Each plane, and
all that it is, becomes his own. Its power, its life, its forms,
are distilled into his being, for when he becomes God,
he will need them all to fructify a Sea of Life which
even now awaits the Call which someday he will know
how to make.
If
you will try to contact the Cosmos, you will
perceive a Sfea of the Unmanifest waiting for the Call
you do not yet know how to make. It is a very wonderful
thought to feel your Godhead needed, as the God of this
universe was needed and did bring within the Circle of His
Ring-Pass-Not the whole of this sea of Green Men. For
there is a sea of sleeping, not yet dreaming, Men awaiting
us. Someday, when we learn how to draw the Great
Circle of our Universe, within that Circle will pour these
Men, and they will grow into Godship.
All who still demand to live exclusively within a
fragment of a plane, and who would insist that elsewhere
is no life, have still far to go, for there is no life anywhere
on any plane which must not become their life.
All who are imprisoned within the boundaries of a
faith, or of a nation, or of a race, or of beliefs or con-
victions, who declare that right and truth are with them,
and are theirs alone, have still far to travel. They have
yet to know that all faiths are revelations of God, all
nations God's people, all beliefs and all convictions vessels
in which a truth is to be found. They have yet to learn to
be all things to all creatures, to go forth among all
creatures and find themselves in them, and to draw into
themselves all creatures, knowing that life, in all its
myriad
forms, is one.

Thus does every experience become a power at the
aspirant's disposal for hastening him more quickly on his
way. And never does he think, not even for a single
moment, that in any experience he has reached an Ultimate
of Life, a fundamental End. Never can he say he has no
further to go. Rather does he declare, with regard to
each, that assuredly it is not an Ultimate, an Everest,
1
than
which there is no higher mount. He declares that however
glorious may be his experience, however divine his
illumination, however deep his ecstasy, however tran-
scendent his vision, there are experiences, illuminations,
ecstasies, visions, still more divine, awaiting his approach.
In the very midst of sunrise or of sunset, of flashing
rainbow or of majestic storm, of awesome rumblings of
thunder, of gorgeous intensities of surging seas, of swift-
flowing rivers, of mountain ranges, of peaceful land-
scape, and of all the splendours of individual experiences
of mind, emotions and the higher consciousness, let the
would-be student of Yoga know in deep realization that
there is
majesty far beyond those he is immediately con-
tacting. He may well rest awhile in the splendours he has
achieved, but even while he is
resting, he must lift
up his
eyes unto those loftier heights whence shall come his
further illumination, and soon must he depart from the
heights he has reached to tread the way upwards, to
regions still more sublime.
True self-realization cannot be achieved, save on the
sure foundations of vitalizing discontent. The Divine Dis-
content of God as He makes His universe must be mirrored
in us, as we make ours.
Away and away and away !

THE YOGA OF MARRIAGE
Sublimation
Inturned
Relaxation
Marriage is
perhaps the holiest act in which any human*
being can participate. You
The particular form of Yoga with which I am concerned
does not, therefore, endorse any withdrawal from the
normal states of consciousness, in the sense of deadening
them, or even of stilling them, but rather of sublimating,
them so that they accompany the wanderer*-Yogi on his
inward way. He cannot return on his homeward journey
with less than all that he has, with any experience left
behind. He needs them all for the Yoga that is Self-
fulfilment. Else why did they scatter his way ?
Hence, there is no moving away from any form of
consciousness. Nor are there prescribed any of those
physical exercises and postures so commonly associated
with what is
supposed to be the practice of Yoga. These
may indeed be modes of approach, especially to certain*
forms of Yoga. But they are only modes. There are
many other modes. And in this particular form of Yoga,
all
preparation is of the nature of an inturned relaxation and
adjustment rather than of any external effort. What has
to be done must be accomplished more by what I
might
call effortless adjustment than by strain of any kind
whatsoever.
The physical body must perform its normal and natural
functions more naturally, more easily and rhythmically. So
yu THE VIGIL OF PURIFICATION
The Holiness of

must the body of the feelings and emotions. So must the
body of the mind. And their various forces must flow
calmly for health, and not tempestuously for craving.
Therefore must all disturbing activities be gradually
brought under perfect self-control. Rhythm must be
established in physical sex activity, insofar as there is to
be any at all, and it must be made holy through observ-
ance within a sacramental setting. Marriage
l
and the
processes of procreation are among the holinesses of
living, as is
'
death, as is birth, as is active entry into the
larger consciousness of citizenship, and so forth. The
sacraments of marriage and of conception are among the
most potent forces of life, for they are among the living
witnesses to our Divinity ; and need, therefore, the pro-
tection of the sacramental setting as, for example, is
provided in religious ceremonial. No one can become a
Yogi who is not intent upon making all these forces holy,
who has not lifted them up unto the Lord of Life.
It
may be well for those so destined that they give
birth to children. But it is well for all that they give birth
to great feelings .and emotions, great aspirations, great
ideas, great plans. And it is to be noticed that man and
woman together create most wondrously. Man and Wife.
Man and Mother. Woman and Father. One man and one
woman in some deep and sacred relationship.
The husband who becomes a father becomes a Knight
of Sacrifice, a Knight of Creative Holiness, and he must
approach his knighthood through a veritable vigil at the
Altar of Consecration.
The wife who becomes a mother becomes a Holy
Gra//, and she must approach her transmutation through a
veritable vigil at the Altar of the Cup.
In truth, marriage is the act of magic whereby a man
and a woman call upon the God within them to set in

motion His divine powers of creation on these lower planes,
wherein two are needed to perform those creative acts
which on the higher planes are performed by a One, in
whom duality dwells potent.
And the fatherhood of the man is God the Father,
shining forth, as the motherhood of the woman is the
shining forth of God the Mother. In a glorious Silence
and Darkness should be born a God, the Son God the
Spirit alive in all three to fructify the splendid Sacrament.
How inexpressibly degraded has become this majestic
glory, whereby the very universe itself exists and moves
irresistibly on its Way of Beauty. Look upon the marriages
of the West, and see so many of them in all their sordid-
ness, in all their emptiness, in all their unreality, though girt
about with the prostituted forms of ceremonial sacrament.
Look upon the crudity of fashion as it
quenches the fires of
holiness with the muddy waters of its futilities. Look upon
the terrible enslavement of a most sacred offering within
the dictates of customs and conventions. No wonder the
world is as it is when Truth can so be set at naught.
There is no more marvellous testimony to man's in-
herent Divinity, nor to the splendours of his transcendent
future, than the inconceivable wonders of what is called
sexual power in this very physical world of ours, and in every
kingdom of nature. But it
may be used either to praise
God or to defile Him, and in these days it is more often
abused, with the results we see around us everywhere, in
human and sub-human misery.
When a power of God such as the power of ssx is
misused, it
spreads devastation far and wide. It
spreads
destitution and pain and suffering. It
spreads wars and
diseases. It
spreads hatreds and tyrannies.
No aspirant tor the crown of the Yogi could ever
desecrate that which Is holy beyond all words of expression.

Self-Dedication But he must purify his vehicles in other ways too.
He must abstain from alcohol and from smoking, since these
habits deaden both the physical nerves and their inner
counterparts to those Teachings out into the great beyond
of consciousness which are the daily and hourly activity of
the true Yogi. He cannot afford to smoke, nor can he
afford to drink alcohol, save under very exceptional circum-
stances. Alcohol and tobacco fumes form sheaths round
all sensitive centres of the lower bodies useful for those
who want to acclimatize themselves to the noises of the
external world, but fatal to the discovery of the inner
worlds.
Harmlessness Similarly, the earnest aspirant for Yoga must avoid all
flesh-eating, for this not only coarsens the various vehicles
to a most devastating extent, but links the flesh-eater to
every process whereby the flesh has been made available
to him to the pain of the animal in very special measure,
so that there must come about the adjustment of retri-
bution before the individual is free to move inwards, leaving
behind him no trace of injustice.

gradual acceleration of the latter's transubstantiation,
burdens himself with the heavy responsibilities, throwing
himself open to devastating repercussions from the wrongs
he commits.
Upon each kingdom of nature is its
appropriate Yoga
bestowed, and miserable indeed is he who would set at
naught that Yoga so that he may enslave a brother to his
selfishness. We thus break his Yoga, and that is a crime
beyond most crimes.
Yoga is in process everywhere. Our universe, the whole
of manifestation, is
part of the Divine Yoga of God. All life
is in process of unfoldment through a Yoga which is uncon-
scious on the lowest plane of its manifestation, though Self-
conscious indeed on its plane of divinity. Each individuality
in every kingdom of nature is a Yogi. Every animal, every
insect, every bird, every creeping thing, every member of
the vegetable and mineral kingdoms, is a Yogi, fulfilling its
Yoga unconsciously within the universal consciousness of
God, the Supreme Yogi, its divine Progenitor and Image,
and within a unique and individual Divine Consciousness
whereby it shall achieve its own Godhead. From one
standpoint we partake of the Universal Yoga of God, but
from another aspect we are Yogis with our own unique
Yogas. Such Yoga is, of course, the seeking of the Self, as
Dr. Besant so beautifully declares in the following passage,
1
for wherever she writes of the seeking of the Self she
might as well have written of the Yoga of the Self :
" If we turn our glance over Nature, if we look over
the whole of the world, everywhere we find things seeking
the Self ; everywhere in every direction, under whatever
form and whatever name, whether wisely or blindly, whether
clear-sightedly or gropingly, all seek the Self, all are
striving to find the Self. The sun as it darts its rays through
1

94 THE VIGIL OF PURIFICATION!
space is
seeking the Self ; the vast ocean when it
surges
into waves is but seeking the Self ; the winds as they
wander over the surface of the earth are seeking the Self ;
the forest trees as they stretch their arms outwards are
seeking the Self ;
every animal, however dimly, is
groping
after the Self, mankind, however blindly, however foolishly,
however mistakenly, is
searching for the Self. This tend-
ency in all creation, this universal fact in every form of
life, in ancient times was called the Seeking of the Self.
Modern science notices the same tendency in Nature, and
names it Evolution. So to whichever side we turn, ancient
or modern, we find this upward, this inward, aspiration.
"
Why should all
things seek the Self ? Why should
the Self be the goal of all endeavours ? Is it not because
the Self dwells alike in the hearts of all ? Whether it be in
the ocean, whether it be in a mineral or in a tree, whether
in an animal or in a man, the Self there is hidden within,
concealed by the outer covering of illusion. The one Self
is seated alike in the sun and in the cavity of the heart,
and every living creature searching after happiness is but
seeking the Self ; for searching, however mistakenly, after
happiness is but the blind groping after the Self which is
Bliss. Yea, the Self is Bliss, eternal, unending, undying,
and what we call happiness is the Self, which is bliss, re-
flected in broken beams through the medium which sur-
rounds us. Let none mistake, let none be blinded by the
divergences of seeking, by the errors caused by the outer
illusions ; for all are really seeking in the outer form the inner
life. They seek it
everywhere, in all their blind efforts after
joy ; and it was the Self Incarnate, Shri Krishna who said :
"Who seeth, seated equally in all beings, the supreme
Ishvara, he seeth (The Bhagavad-Gha, XIII, 28)."
Self-conscious As has already been written, only in the human king-
Yoga
dom, and in parallel kingdoms in other evolutionary
schemes, is there the dawning of Self-conscious Yoga. And
ENEMIES WITHIN THE GATES 95

Stairs
only when the experiences of the human kingdom are in
process of being fulfilled, is the age-old Yogi beginning to
know Yoga, and to come face to face with that Yoga
which is his alone. Thus from unconsciousness does he
pass to Self-consciousness, and begin the long and arduous
way which, after countless light-years, leads him to the
foot of his eternal throne upon which he ascends to seat
himself as a God.
A Son of Yoga, a Man of Yoga, must become a God
of Yoga. This is the high purpose of his unfoldment. All
creatures are Men, as the Mystic Truth has it : In the begin-
ning were Men, and Men were with God, and were God.
Howsoever Life appears in the kingdoms of nature, all forms
are Men reaching out to their Divinities.
It is, therefore, indeed a major crime to place in
the way of any Yogi, unconscious or Self-conscious, an
obstacle of any kind, for every obstacle thus placed
becomes an obstacle in his own way, and only as he
removes the obstacle from the path of his brother, will its
counterpart in his own way disappear.
Harmlessness
l
raised to the highest possible power is
essential to the would-be Yogi, and he must shrink from
no human ridicule or contempt to achieve that glorious aid
and blessing which earnest harmlessness bestows.
As for any other qualifications, I can think of no
finer statement of them than the following from the pen of
H. P. Blavatsky, herself the greatest Yogi of our time
living in the outer world :
A clean life, an open mind, a pure heart, an eager
intellect, an unveiled spiritual perception, a brotherliness for one's
co-disciple, a readiness to give and receive advice and instruction,
a loyal sense of duty to the Teacher, a willing obedience to
the behests of Truth, once we have placed our confidence in,
and believe that Teacher to be in possession of it ; a courage-
ous endurance of personal injustice, a brave declaration of
principles, a valiant defence of those who are unjustly attacked,

and a constant eye to the ideal of human progression and
perfection which the secret science depicts these are the golden
stairs up the steps of which the learner may climb to the Temple
of Divine Wisdom.
THE PROTECTIVE WEB
"
Every man has around him a certain protective coating
that keeps him safe from the many lives around, which might be
hostile to himself. He walks, as it were, angel-guarded as long as
he breathes the life of love, the love that is divine and makes all
creatures friendly. But if
you do a cruel thing to an animal, or
slay an animal, you attach that animal to yourself by the link of
fear and hatred. The animal cannot by itself do much. One
animal's feelings are not much in this great world. You have done
more by that act of cruelty ;
you have broken through the cover-
ing which keeps you safe from the evils around you. You have
opened the door by your cruel act, and through that open door
all the animal suffering in the world can pierce you ; the one be-
comes a channel through which the whole can pour into you and
affect you for evil." The Birth of New India, by Annie Besant.
I have no space to quote at length from the wonderful
description in Dr. Besant's The Ancient Wisdom, Chapter X,
showing the unfoldment of the Law of Sacrifice, whereby its
automatic activity in the sub-human kingdoms ultimately gives
place to a self-conscious administering of the Law by the Divine in
Man as human being. I ask you to read most carefully Dr Besant's
words, among the most significant she has ever uttered.
As regards the protective web in the aura of each individual,
we are continually breaking it.

Dynamic Yoga
Rhythm more
than Exertion
And then, the goal ; beyond which lie, bathed in the sunlight
of the Spirit, glories untold, unseen by any save the eye of
the Soul. The Voice of the Silence
The true Yogi must be dynamic, ever moving with
the less he has achieved to the more which lies before
him. He must remain static in no thought, in no feeling,
in no desire, in no aspiration, in no state of consciousness.
He must be dynamic in fact, however static he may be in
appearance. And I would make bold to say that it is not
cessation of function which is the purpose of Yoga, but
rather the sublimation, and therefore a supreme intensi-
fication, of function. I
agree that there is
just a little
something in the maintenance of some physical or other
posture for a period of time. But I have the gravest
doubts as to the inducement thereby of any condition of
true Yoga. Above all, evolution is movement.
In any case, I am concerned only with the approach to
a form I
by no means say
" the form
"
of Symbolic Yoga,
and it has been my experience that for its
understanding
rhythm is infinitely more purposeful than exertion, that it
helps more to do better, far better if
possible, that which I
am in the habit of doing save, of course, that which hinders
than to send any available force to furrow new grooves.
As power gains in spiritual intensity, it will flood all
fields of consciousness, and render channels, though not
perhaps reservoirs, comparatively unnecessary.

which is to say fulfilled. But the very burning depends
upon a fulfilment achieved through lives of slow fulfilling.
And for the most part such fulfilment can be, and should
be, in the normal everyday pathway of growth.
So far, my experience convinces me that all necessary
contacts are in existence for penetration into the ultimate
realities of life, or rather into what may be called Ultimates
from our existing point of disadvantage. The necessary
channels are all there. Some have been grossly misused,
and need drastic cleaning. Others have not yet been
opened, though they exist the way is there, waiting for
the Will.
One of the most interesting qualities of this form of
Yoga lies, in the fact that at once it
brings the student into
touch with the great End while he is still, as it were, fum-
bling with the means. Thus, upon the very threshold of
his accelerating way shines in some measure a perceived
reflection of those Ultimates which it will necessarily take
him aeons to achieve.
The various symbols which I shall shortly be introducing
to you are symbols of Truth infinitely beyond our most
profound comprehension, let alone any question of contact.
Yet, in some magic way, we are able to gain a distinct
apprehension or awareness of them, at least while the spirit
of the Yoga is
upon us.
But I must emphasize that relatively speaking they are
Ultimates, though who shall speak of final Ultimates ? And
my own personal experience convinces me that they are
extraordinarily potent in their adjustment of myself as I am

as yet too weak and small to enclose either Time or
Eternity.
I think you too will see how wonderful an atmosphere
is induced even by the shortest contemplation of one of
the symbols associated with this particular form of Yoga.
You may not, I think you will not, understand them. But
they will, I am sure, be to you in this darkness of ours as
intimations in some wise of a Light ineffable.

I have sought to become a student of Yoga, not in and

on the plane of the will, not content with climbing,
though climb I must, but willing myself to stand for a
moment on an eminence that I
may have some vision at
least of the glories towards which my will is determined to
move. I have had, and am, of course, still
having,
some little practical experience of this form of Yoga at
work in me.
I
pass on such experience, not to be copied, but that
it may knock upon the frontiers of the kingdom of the will
in each one of you, to stir you to quicker movement on
your way to discover your own Yoga within you. For be

The One in the
All
The
Expanding of
Consciousness
THE VIGIL OF PURIFICATION
One of the earliest glimpses one gains of one's own
reality is not only of its immortality, but no less, in some
mysterious and incomprehensible way, of its omnipresence,
so that every living thing in every kingdom of nature, every
planet, every star, every constellation, in the Spaces of
God, are somehow oneself.
1
Thus is it that, in this form of Yoga, a contemplation
of far-off Ultimates forms an essential part of the earliest
training. It is
highly necessary that as far as possible the Be-
yond shall form part of what is called the waking conscious-
ness, though the inner consciousness must ever be more awake
than the outer. Consciousness is elastic and requires scien-
tific stretching, such as may be accomplished by the influence
of symbols, which are overwhelming realities so expressed that
we may look upon them without danger, and with at least
some small measure of understanding. That excess of their
glory which would dazzle us to blindness, and confuse us to
destructive misunderstanding, is veiled from us. Our eyes
are open and we may see.
The end adjusts the means.
But how shall I
gain some knowledge of the heights
to which a duly performed Yoga must eventually bring me ?

Already, for long, had I been somewhat of a mount-
aineer/ as perhaps my books on Mount Everest and
Nirvana, especially the latter, indicate. And in trying to
understand India's mighty Science of Dancing, of Spiritual
Movement expressed through physical forms, I was impelled
to the belief that through symbology I
might perceive and
approach my heights more truly. Furthermore, as I
watched Shrimati Rukmini Devi so very obviously uttering
Truth in her rhythms, in her gestures, in every movement,
whether of voice or of body, it became clear to me that
movement, gesture, song, silence all are surely the physical!
formulae or symbols of otherwise inexpressible Reality. I
saw at once that dancing, degraded though it so largely is in
the West, purposeless though it is, however beautiful even in
its splendours of the true ballet, is indeed in essence as divine
as it is
regarded in Hinduism. And I
longed to develop
my own spiritual ascent with the aid of, under the com-
pelling inspiration of, the Life behind all forms.
And so has it come to pass. For the occasion came
for me to be admitted to the environment of a Lord of
Yoga, of Spiritual Movement, within whose highly spiritual

field I
might perchance be able to understand a little of His
magic. On a number of occasions I saw before me certain
symbols of forms vibrate with eternal life and meaning,
microcosmic formulae of macrocosmic processes. I saw
that these symbol-forms constituted stages in a mode of
yogic unfoldment, terms in a series of consciousness-
expansions.
I
perceived also that, in the mode of Yoga which was
being disclosed to my view, each act of Yoga involved a
blending in some measure, of the beginnings, ways and
end of life, so that it became a potent means whereby the
circumstances of time obtained adjustment to their eternal
archetypes. All processes contain within themselves their
ends as well as their origins, and in this form of Yoga sym-
bols are used to evoke in the consciousness of the student
a sense of his eternal meaning. These symbols reflect
some among the great Ultimates of Life, and are inherent
in everything that lives.
Each one of us, each denizen of every kingdom of
nature, is such an Ultimate in all its modes. In its universal
aspect, no less than in its aspect of individuality, Ultimate-
ness is inherent in us all. Each symbol of the Ultimate has its
reflection in each one of us, or rather has in us its substance
as well as its shadow. So is it that in this form of Yoga the
symbol of an eternal is constantly present at every stage of
the exercises. And as a series, these Symbols form a
thread of constancy, a theme of unity, amidst the changing
modalities which the evolutionary process rings upon them.
The Lord of Yoga who revealed to me this particular
form of "the Science is one of those Personages who
embody what is called in Hinduism the Dance of Shiva,
the Yoga of Eternal Rhythm as performed by Him who is
the Regenerator of the world, with Vishnu as the Sustainer,
and Brahma as the Creator. This great Teacher is one of
the Agents of this aspect of the Trinity of God, is a

and an Inspirer of all who sing and dance to

Through forms, postures, gestures, movements, in

whereby the whole world draws ever nearer to the Real.
The Dance of | do not think a better description of the spirit of
such embodiment exists than that in the great musician
Scriabine's Poem of Ecstasy. I cannot resist the
temptation to quote the extract which appears in
A. K. Coomaraswamy's The Dance of Shiva, which book I
commend to your careful reading :
The Spirit playing,
The Spirit longing,
The Spirit with fancy creating all,
Surrenders Himself to the bliss of love. . .
Amid the flowers of His creation, He lingers in kiss. . .
Blinded by their beauty, He rushes, He frolics, He dances,
He whirls. . ,
He is all rapture, all bliss, in this play
Free, divine, in this love struggle.
In the marvellous grandeur of sheer aimlessness,
And in the union of counter-aspirations
In consciousness alone, in love alone,
The Spirit learns the nature of His divine being. . .
"
O, my world, my life, my blossoming, my ecstasy !
Your every moment I create
By negation of all forms previously lived through :
I am eternal negation. ..."
Enjoying this dance, choking in this whirlwind,
Into the domain of ecstasy, He takes swift flight.
In this unceasing change, in this flight, aimless, divine
The Spirit comprehends Himself,
In the power of will, alone, free,
Ever-creating, ail-irradiating, all-vivifying,
Divinely playing in the multiplicity of forms, He compre-
hends Himself. . . .
" I
already dwell in thee, O my world,
Thy dream of me 'twas I
coming into existence. , .
And thou art all one wave of freedom and bliss. ..."

For the present, let us seek to stand together upon
those heights whence, in that distance which separates
Time from Eternity, we shall see as in the Heavens a symbol
of the Godhead of all Gods. First, we must undergo the
Vigil of Purification at the Altars of our Higher Selves,
feeding each vehicle of consciousness with pure food and
holy purpose. Priests as we are at our Altars, we may
perform for ourselves the great Act of Transubstantiation,
set forth in all its supernal glories in Christianity and
Hinduism.
I have already referred to this in relation to creative
activity on the physical plane, and to that aspect of purifi-
cation which gives poised and athletic receptivity to the
body in abstinence from flesh-eating, alcohol and smok-
ing. I have also referred to H. P. Blavatsky's general
statement as to the ladder leading to the Temple of Divine
Wisdom.
We may sum up the sublimation needed for the
physical body in the terms Grace, Dignity, Poise, Purity
and Strength. Thus is
receptivity assured so far as regards

106 THE VIGIL OF PURIFICATION

the physical body itself, for all these are the distillation of
Right Living in this great region of Tension.
We then come to the body of desires, feelings and
emotions. This vehicle we feed with the whole range of
those movements which appertain to what we must call
Love, though this beautiful word has been the subject of
so much degradation in modern times in the West. Among
such movements the most important are the Reverence
Scale, the Goodwill Scale, and the Compassion Scale. So
we may sum up the sublimation needed for the body of
desires and emotions in the terms Reverence, Goodwill,
Compassion, Aspiration, adding to these the terms belong-
ing specially to the purification of the physical body. Thus
is
receptivity assured so far as this body is concerned, for
all these are the distillation of Right Living in this great
region pf Movement.
Then we come to the body of the mind. This body
we feed with what I must call for want of a better word
Knowledge, by which I mean a gathering of, the analysing
of, and the partial synthesizing of the nature of things as
we are able to perceive them in the various kingdoms of
nature, and of seeking to ascribe to each of them its Order,
its
Purpose, its Law. So may we sum up the sublimation
needed for the body of the mind, in terms of Collation,
Analysis, Synthesis, Order, Law, Purpose, adding to these
the terms belonging to the other vehicles. Thus is
receptiv-
ity assured so far as this body is concerned, for all these
are the distillation of Right Living in this great region of
Understanding.
But we are so far offering upon the Altar of Purifica-
tion only the Right Living aspects of our evolutionary path.
What about the weaknesses which constitute what I can
only call Wrong Living, it being understood that Right and
Wrong are relative terms, and do not at all establish any
absolute code or orthodoxy.
THE ALTAR OF SUBLIMATION 107
The
Offering of our
"Weaknesses
The illusion of
Prejudice
The
Universalization
of Individuality
These weaknesses we must also offer, of whatever
nature they may be. And the mode of their offering
is to look them squarely in the face, and perceive
where they are virtues turned upside down, as they general-
ly are. Thus perceiving, we shall begin to be able in a
very real sense to "right" them, mingling their fragrances
with those of our virtues.
In this connection I refer you to Section 1 1 of the
first
(Adyar ed., second) volume of The Secret Doctrine, in
the course of which reference is made to the Kabalistic
saying,
" Demon est Deus inversus," and to the fact that
"if Evil disappeared, Good would disappear along with it
from Earth. . . . There is no malum in se ;
only the Shadow
of Light, without which Light could have no existence, even
in our perceptions." Evil is "evil for some, good for
others."
I wish very specially to warn would-be students of
Yoga against prejudices, obstinacies, self-justifications, and
all other manifestations of the pride which is for ever exalt-
ing the constituent elements of the temporary self to which
it
belongs.
Race prejudice, nation prejudice, faith prejudice, opin-
ion prejudice, family prejudice, all are highly detrimental
to the practice of Yoga, and particularly that subtle form of
prejudice which seeks to camouflage its very existence with-
in the garments of righteousness.
A Yogi belongs to the whole world. He belongs to
all faiths. He is free in all circumstances. He is a master
of circumstances ; not a child, as are most, to be nursed
by them.
Having been for aeons unconscious in his Yoga, in his
approach to Self-conscious Yoga he begins to universalize
his individuality, just as the beginning of his way was
characterized by an individualization of that universality in
the protection of which he set forth on his mighty
108 THE VIGIL OF PURIFICATION
Positive
Sublimation
Apotheoses
wanderings. And the process of universalization, wherein the
individuality grows more and not less, draws him inexpress-
ibly near to all life around him, visible and invisible.
He begins to know. Therefore he begins to under-
stand. Therefore he begins to help. Therefore he begins
to laud. No knowledge is true which separates. It is but
a poor caricature of knowledge.
The whole process of this sublimation has yet to be-
come clear, but at least there emerges the idea that it is
highly I wonder if I dare say, exclusively individual to each
student. Each student must examine the whole content of
each of his consciousnesses physical, "astral," and the
rest so as to perceive what he has to exalt and how he is
to exalt it.
I think we may say in general that the process of sub-
liming is
*
governed by the law that everything grows from
less to more. Out of every weakness will grow a strength,
out of every vice will grow a virtue, even though both
weakness and vice must first fulfil themselves as such.
Some must if I
may use the expression without being mis-
understood reach vice-heights before they turn homewards
to reach virtue-heights. And out of every strength will grow
a -power, as out of every virtue a glory. Hence the work of
sublimation is
positive and not negative. It consists in the
discernment of the shortest way whereby weaknesses may
become strengths, vices virtues, strengths powers, and
virtues glories. A weakness is a strength in the becoming.
A vice is a virtue in the becoming. A strength is a
power in the becoming. A virtue is a glory in the
becoming.
Hatred is love in the becoming. Passion is
compassion
1
in the becoming. Pride is
understanding in the becoming.
Selfishness is
generosity in the becoming. Each may be
far off from its consummation. Yet out of the acorn grows,
the splendid oak.
THE ALTAR OF SUBLIMATION 109

Restatement
Sublimation thus consists in
perceiving apotheoses,
and in accelerating movement towards them or unfoldment
in them. Any individual who is
truly ready for Yoga has
already moved far towards the apotheosis of hatred, of
passion, of pride, of selfishness. But, if after careful and
impersonal examination, he decides that he has not yet
moved far enough away from the earlier incarnations of
any particular apotheosis, that he has not yet reached its
later incarnations, he will seek to impress his present state
with somewhat of the future apotheosis, thus effecting in
some measure a transubstantiation.
I am labouring this point somewhat, because I want to
avoid any sort of suggestion that there must be a with-
drawal from any state of consciousness, a negation of any
kind. The strength of the Yogi does not lie in withdrawing
from the world, but rather in fulfilling the world, not by
collecting innumerable experiences at all costs, not by lying
static in the midst of them, but by universalizing each to its
strength, to its virtue, to its power, to its glory. Each of
his weaknesses he conjures into strength by the magic of his
fore-seen Godhead. Each of his strengths he conjures
into power. Each of his vices he conjures into virtues, each
of his virtues into glories.
I think that the science of psychology needs some
restatement in the light of the above considerations. We
have hardly begun to examine the technique of modifying the
inclinations of an individual's current forces so as to acceler-
ate his growth, and to meet his evolving needs. At present
there is not a little tendency to desire to kill or to starve,
when the line of least resistance would be to cause to
operate differently. Both psychology and psycho-analysis,
the latter especially, will become infinitely more real as we
seek to assign to weaknesses and vices their due place in
the evolutionary process, and to perceive them to be forces
which we class as weaknesses and vices because we have in
I1U THE VIGIL OF PURIFICATION

fact no further use for the directions they have so far
taken. A weakness is a force which is now being wrongly
directed. A vice is a stabilization of wrong direction.
The tide has fortunately turned in the field of medicine
in the West. The orthodox physician of yesterday has
turned the psychologist of today. Articles are appearing
in medical journals of the highest scientific repute in which
for the treatment of such material illnesses as skin-disease,
cancer, and other actual organic ills, the patient is
given
ethical advice that might easily have emanated from a
religious teacher rather than from a scientist. The physician
is
regaining his old position never lost in true eastern
medicine of spiritual healer.
C. G. Jung, one of the best known of modern psycho-
logists, has made a splendid attempt in his Secret of the
Golden Flower to bring to western psychology this wisdom
of the East. He speaks of a life
"
which, if lived with
complete devotion, brings an intuition of the self, the
individual being." As to the trend of irreligious feeling,
he writes :
We indeed think we can flatter ourselves at having already
reached . . .
heights of clarity because . . .
phantoms of
gods seem to have been left far behind. But the things we have
outgrown are only the word-ghosts, not the psychic facts which
were responsible for the birth of the gods.
The gods have become diseases ; not Zeus, but the sblar*
plexus, now rules Olympus ... It is not a matter of unconcern
whether one calls something a
"
mania
"
or a
"
god/' To serve a
mania is detestable and undignified, but to serve a god is full of
meaning, and rich in possibilities, because it means yielding to a
higher, invisible, and spiritual being. The personification enables
one to see the relative reality of the autonomous partial-system,
which, in turn, makes its assimilation possible and depotentializes
the forces of external life. When God is not recognized, selfish
desires develop, and out of this selfishness comes illness.
We have yet to learn to perceive light in every dark-
ness, for darkness is the progenitor of light. It is this on
which the would-be Yogi of this particular yogic path should
be intent.
THE ALTAR OF SUBLIMATION 11T
Frustrations

The Eternal
Peace
Garnering for
the Future
His act of Yoga on each and every plane of conscious-
ness, from the physical upwards, is to offer to his God-
head the incense of his sacrifice, of his act of making holy
all that is his, was his, and shall be his. We are very com-
plete, very compact. We are Gods. We are Altars. We
are the Priests, and we are the Sacrifice. We do not need
anything from outside. If we have all the external temples
and priesthoods, and holy objects of sacrifice, as in the
religions of the world, it is to remind us of all that is within
us. We should be perfectly justified in
having a picture of
Ourselves above our Altars, provided it was not a time-
picture but was some sort of representation of the Ego, the
Eternal Self.
The would-be Yogi, therefore, must have the inestim-
able advantage of understanding how to make a silk
purse
out of that which looks like a sow's ear, flowers out of
apparent weeds, rainbows out of seeming darknesses, and
triumphs out of would-be frustrations. He should know
how to do all this, and work at it on every plane of his
consciousness.
\ Meditation on these Symbols and reduction of them
to individual formulae of life give to each individual some
sense of his eternal meaning, apart from the particular
incarnation in which he lives, apart from his present prob-
lems. It lifts him above his sorrows and above his joys
into that peace in which both Joy and Sorrow blend.
Thus this particular type of Yoga does not involve any
withdrawal from plane after plane of consciousness, but
rather a fulfilment of plane after plane.

112 THE VIGIL OF PURIFICATION
The man who is intent upon Yoga gathers everything with
him so that he may retire into the inner regions of his
heart with the whole of himself. Everything that he has
ever been is with him.
1
There is
nothing left behind.
Only we must bring everything to its flower. Out of the
mud, and through the water, the lotus flower ascends into
the sunshine.
But I had better delay any ideas I
may have as regards
the methods of so working until you have accompanied me
into the regions of the Ultimates, for only as we gain a
glimpse of these, shall we be able to reflect them down on
to the various planes of consciousness, externalized for our
evolving.
1
"The power of creating a universe is only gained, according to The
Wisdom, by involving within the Self ail that is later to be put forth. A Logos
does not create out of nothing, but evolves all from Himself ; and from the
experiences we are now passing through, we are gathering the materials out
of which we may build a system in the future.

"I WILL LIFT UP MINE EYES UNTO
THE HILLS"
And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John, his
brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart, and was
transfigured before them : and his face did shine as the sun, and
his raiment was white as the light. Matthew, XVII, 1, 2
Let us assume we have established on every plane
we can contact the constructive stillness of which I have
already written. Let us assume we have converged each
plane consciousness into the bud, not yet into the flower, of
its fruition, that we have stilled all into relative harmony and
essential purpose.
The Physical Let us assume we have done this on what we call
Plane Yoga is
Dominant the physical plane I
really do not know how I am to
define the word "
physical," though I have suggested
the idea of "tension." Etymologies give us the idea
of productivity as suggestive of its
meaning, as if
every
other plane of consciousness were not infinitely more
productive. For my own part, I should regard this so-
called physical plane as the plane on which Yoga in its
most completely externalized aspect is dominant. The
physical plane is the plane of consciousness externalized
almost, though not quite, to its limits, and in which life
individualities are at work at the very frontiers of conscious-
ness, forthgoing, involving in every kingdom of nature the
The Group-Soul group-soul idea of Theosophy. I believe that the group-
soul idea Has truth in the human kingdom as well as in the
114 THE VIGIL OF PURIFICATION

Consciousness
sub-human kingdoms, though differently. There is but One
Soul with its constituent group-souls, however much there
be an infinitude of individualities. Indeed, the very idea
of individuality necessitates the conception of the One.
The physical plane is the plane of the universal power
in its microcosmic functioning, so that the individualities or
Monads, which are the near Ultimates of Life, grow in terms
of multitudes, sharing experience until such mode or type
of sharing is no longer possible as growth-acceleration
proceeds. Does not God economize ?
Let us assume we have done this on what we call
the astral plane, though here again I do not know how
I am going to define the word " astral
"
I have called
it
" movement." It is the plane of attraction and repulsion,
desire, of throbbing movement, of heights and depths, of
love and hatred, of aspirations. Why call it
" astral
"
?
Let us assume we have done this on the plane of the
mind, the plane of collecting and collating concepts, of
analysing and synthesizing them, the plane of the lower
laws of evolving life. It is the plane of the lower memories
both in analysis and synthesis. It is, perhaps, the key
plane of the first section of the evolutionary process. It is
the plane of awakening to the glories of life the glory
forthshadowing itself first in narrow pride and at last in
universal praise.
I
hardly think I need take into account those higher
vehicles which, in the case of most of us, still remain em-
bryonic. We may have flashes of what is called in Theo-
sophical terminology, following that of the Hindu Scriptures,
the Buddhic consciousness, that consciousness which is the
realization of Law, of the Law of the Eternal Life the Law
of Universal Memory reflected in our outer time world as
the laws of nature. The word " intuition

only very
partially expresses the significance of this realm.

reflected in these realms of manifestation, the Will-con-

In a word, we must follow the advice Shri Krishna
*
gave to Arjuna, and rise above our changing consciousness
contents, not by fighting them and conquering them, not
even by exalting them, but by learning how to forget
them constructively so that they become habits and
instincts. Only those contents of our consciousness which
we can afford to forget are really ours.
I have said that there is little contact we can make
with the planes on which our Law-consciousness, our Light-
consciousness and' our Life-consciousness are functioning.
Yet we need some touch with all three of these for some
kind of vision of the symbols of the Eternal Truths.
Can we gain this touch ? I think we can gain it
vicariously if we offer upon the Altar of Purification all
lower bodies made holy, that is, truly sacrificed. The purity
of the lower vehicles is a potent call to the awakening of
the higher vehicles to active co-operation with them. And
upon the earnest student of Yoga shall perhaps descend a
blessing from an Elder so that he may see beyond his
present sight. As a child may be lifted upon the shoulders
of his father to see with delight that which must otherwise
be hidden from him, so the self-controlled and humble
aspirant may be enfolded in that magic blessing which shall

reveal to him the mightier heights, the very symbols
themselves of that Supreme Transubstantiation which
glorifies all Earths and makes all Heavens still more sublime.
Standing on the Mount of Exaltation, by the grace of our
Elders, we become transfigured, and see that which we
shall find so difficult to remember.
PLANES OF CONSCIOUSNESS
I find myself using various terms to indicate my understanding
of the closely interwoven states of consciousness, and I fear lest I
may be confusing those of my readers who may be accustomed
to Theosophical literature, in which a definite sequence has been
established.
May I observe that it is one thing to read with the mind and
from a book the nature of the differences separating one plane or
state from another, and quite another thing to experience these
differences ?
We have the most fragmentary information regarding the
exact nature of the difference between one sub-state or sub-
plane of consciousness and another, within the plane or state
as a whole.
I find, for example, no little difficulty in satisfactorily dis-
tinguishing the various sub-planes of the Tension (Physical) and
Movement (Astral) states of consciousness. I find it a little easier
to distinguish between the four lower sub-planes of Mind-con-
sciousness and the three upper sub-planes, because we leave the
rupa (form or concrete) regions and transport ourselves into the
arupa (formless or abstract) regions. But even here it is difficult to
make a clear distinction between individual sub-planes within each
fourfold or threefold division.
The difficulty pursues me still more ruthlessly when I come to
the region of what is called Buddhic consciousness or, as I term it,
Law-consciousness the laws of the upper division of the Mind
plane being resolved into Universal Law.
I know the nature of the plane as a whole, but the subtle
differences between one sub-plane and another baffle me.
Still greater is the difficulty when I come to Nirvanic con-
sciousness or, as I term it, Light-consciousness the Universal Law
being perceived in its prototype of Light.
I see clearly that beyond the Light there is what I can only
call, for want of a better word, the Life or the Will, the Life or the
Will of God as expressed on this lowest plane of Divinity.
WILL LIFT UP MINE EYES UNTO THE HILLS" 117
Now I see so clearly the distinction between the Light and
the Life or the Will, for the Light is the Life or the Will in incarna-
tion, that I am always thinking I see a plane entirely distinct from
Nirvana. I think I
may say that the plane of Life or Will is the
Monadic plane in Theosophical nomenclature. (See Fig. 3 in The
Chakras, by C. W. Leadbeater.)
On the other hand, the distinction between the lower four and
the higher three subdivisions of the Mind plane is so emphatic that I
might quite well have deemed I was perceiving a distinct plane
in these three higher regions, had not my experience made
very clear to me that i was looking at one single plane.
So I ask my readers to pay little attention to the whole
question of actual divisions, and to see in my arrangement a
ladder of consciousness irrespective of its divisions into planes
and sub-planes.
I
begin, for purposes of convenience, with the physical plane,
which I call the Tension Plane, and then designate the next rung of
the Ladder as the Movement Plane, passing upwards to the Mind
Plane, and thence to the Law Plane, from that to the Light Plane,
and then, as the summit of this particular Ladder, the Life or
Will Plane. In the text of this book the Plane of Light I have
called
"
Nirvanic," and the Plane of Life or Will
"
Monadic."
How many actual planes this arrangement covers does not
very much matter.
There are no stations to correspond with the various sub-
planes at each of which someone says : "All change here for the
next sub-plane," so that we are constantly having distinctions
thrust before us. Similarly, there are no stations separating one
plane from another.
The consciousness of them all is
intricately interwoven, and it
seems difficult to know from down here where one begins and
another ends.
THE STAR
In those moments of rest from teaching the people, the Divine
Child dwelt alone in a garden. By the edge of a pool of white lilies, there
was a low circular marble seat, and often he sat on the grass, resting
his head and arms on the seat, and dreaming. He had with him a
book, but it was different from all other books in the world. It con-
tained no words, and on each of its
pages was a series of concentric
circles. The space between two circles was divided into many unequal
segments, and each segment was coloured. The figure on each page
was different, varying in the number of the circles, the segments and
the colours. These figures of the book were alive, for each was a key
which released cosmic forces.
These forces were embodied in music, and each diagram was in
some mysterious way the summation of a sonata or a symphony. The
cosmic thought which was the soul of the music was stated in symbol in
the figure on the page. So when the Divine Child looked at each
symbol, he released cosmic forces of sound, and each plane and
sub-plane contributed its share of sound to the ordered whole. All
things everywhere, mineral and plant, animal and man and angel,
joined in the music, and each gave its chord or phrase as the music
developed theme by theme.
The music was to the Divine Child the road which led to his Star.
Night and day, when teaching the people, or when with the three
sisters, or when he nestled by the side of the Wonderful Maiden, he was
ever dreaming of his Star. So as he sat on the grass, and leaned his
head on the marble seat, and looked at the book which rested on his
lap, the music of the great Gods came to him to tell him of his Star.
Then his radiating compassion for the many became a burning beam of
love for the One, and his body fell from him, as with a sigh of rapture
he went to his Star. For such is the nature of a Divine Child.

SYNOPSIS OF BOOK TWO
Chapter 1
THE POINT AS SEED OF EVOLUTION
We are looking upon a Radiance which seems to be a Point. It is
a Point of Silence, a Point of Darkness. We see in this Point the
Consummation of a mighty aeon of manifestation, its fruition. It is as if
we heard : Consummation est ! And then : Let there be Light
'
Chapter 2
THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE POINT
Now we are discovering the Point to be no longer without us, but
in some mysterious way we discover it within us, as part of our being.
And the vision reveals to us not only the Point within, but the wondrous
universality of the Point in all manifestation, and in the unmanifest
no less.
Chapter 3
THE POTENTIALITY OF THE POINT
The Point symbolizes for us an infinity of potentiality based on an
aeon of consummation. The music of the approach to the symbol of
the Point is that of a trumpet-blast, followed by the infinitely deep yet
dull rumbling of a thunder-cloud, there being a gorgeous crescendo of
vibration between the two. In terms of light, there is the flashing forth
of a veritable rainbow, changing into rapid hues of violet and purple,
growing darker and darker until no light of any hue can be seen by
the lower consciousness. But the Point is More-than-Sound, More-
than-Light !
Chapter 4
THE ESSENCE-POINT
The Point, despite all its grandeur and sublimity, is but a limitation!
designed for our understanding. It is the essence of things to which
Yoga leads us, and the idea of the Point is
given us to suggest the idea
of essence. We use words : Manifest, Unmanifest, Movementless Poise,
122 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
Ceaseless Eternal Breath, Silence, Darkness, Sound, Light, and all the
rest but all are within the One which is symbolized by the Point.
Chapter 5
HARVESTING THE FIELDS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
Everything you are doing now and at any other time is a ploughing,
a reaping, a harvesting for fruition in the Point. We contemplate the
Point apotheosis of all things, promise of ail things, symbol of that
Silence which is the heaven of sound, symbol of that Darkness which is
the heaven of light ; and we proceed to bring these ultimates into the
perspective of each rung of the ladder of our consciousness.
Chapter 6
COSMIC CONCEPTIONS OF THE POINT
The Point is You. In your supreme moments, you will be able to
feel a Silence and to touch a Darkness, touch the radiance and the form
of the formless Point, and feel the Ceaseless Breath of God in which the
Point pulsates. For intangibility increasingly accompanies the outflowing
life as it moves towards its circumference. At the centre, tangibility
achieves its apotheosis'.
Chapter 7
ADVENTURES INTO THE INFINITE POINT
I have tried with my imagination the power that builds bridges to
Heaven, and hurls over precipices into hell and with all the magic that
in me lies, to enter into the Point in all spiritual endeavour and reckless
adventure. And the shadow that does come to me is
" Ceaseless
Eternal Breath." But in these regions, as in all others, there comes a
Ring-Pass-Not.
Chapter 8
THE POINT OUR UNFOLDED SELF
In the Point we contact a state of Causelessness which is more
than cause. For the Point is the primordial symbol containing in its nature
all the rest. The Point at its own level becomes More, which is
beyond
us but we know that evolution may be summed up in the one word
"
More." Finally, the Point is
symbol of the Monad, and we perceive it
to be our unfolded Self our beginning, our way, our end.
Chapter 9
THE WEB THAT IS THE WOMB
The Father-Mother spirit emerges out of the Silence and the
Darkness of the Point, and a cosmic fecundation takes place. Vibrant
SYNOPSIS 123
with alt the contents of the Point is the Web that is a Womb. Miracle
Matrix is it of the Eternal Life, for it constitutes the Sound, the Colour
and the Form of Eternal Divinity, and thus fashions the manifest-to-be
in the living image of its own essential Godhead. From the Beginning
to the End does the Web-Womb remain, as does its
Progenitor, the
Point ; and so the other symbols. Silent Watcher does each become of
that to which it
gives birth.
Chapter 1
THE LINE FLASHES FORTH
The Line is marvellous, for it is at this point that we hear the
Sound, and see the Light, which themselves are born of the Silence and
the Darkness. Forth flashes the Line in all its
Song-Light from the
centre, the Point, to the north, and from the centre, the Point, to the
south, halted at either end by the Will which bids a Sea of the Un-
manifest awaken to its destiny.
Chapter 1 1
THE SPINDLE LINE
As the Web is the Cradle, so is the Line the axis round which
the universe revolves the Divine Measure of the Forthgoing. The
Line is a spiral as Space-Time and Matter- Energy are curvatures
according to modern science. The Point is curved, the Line is curved,
and also the other symbols. Symbolic Yoga is the Yoga of Essential
Curvature.
Chapter 1 2
THE LINE GIVES A NEW CONCEPTION OF MAN-WOMAN
The Line symbol involves that sex-power is the glorious reflection
of the Creative Spirit pervading all consciousness, all life, all being. Each
living thing and all things are living is Man-Woman. The male and
female elements are sometimes separated for purposes of more intensive
evolution. The Godhead is the sublimation of Man-Womanhood.
Chapter 1 3
SEX: A SACRAMENT OF CONSECRATION
Every posture of Symbolic Yoga is an assertion of the sanctity of
sacrament, and of the right of every seed to grow into the beauty of
its destined flower. And the Yogi knows that the candle of creative
activity cannot be burned at both ends.

Chapter 1 4
THE ALL-EMBRACING LINE
To sum up, this Line is the Divine Measure, the Yard-Stick of the
descent and ascent of the Life-to-be. It is the all-embracing standard
for both the highest and lowest reaches of the manifested Life.
Chapter 1 5
THE CIRCLE-GLOBE: THE RING-PASS-NOT
The Line in a flash becomes the diameter of the Circle, which is the
fourth great symbol in this form of Yoga. The Circle marks the frontiers
of the new evolutionary process, and also draws round the Point, the
Web and the Line a sea of undifferentiated life, of sleeping Monads, to
be awakened by the Call, in terms of Light, Form and Sound, of a God,
Chapter 1 6
THE SEA OF MEN IN. THE CIRCLE
The Raga of a new Life sounds forth. The Word of the Line is
spoken, and the words of a myriad Monads echo in response. I see
Men and Men and Men a Man-family extraordinarily interdependent :
man-Man needs God-Man, animal-Man, vegetable-Man, mineral-Man
and elemental-essence-Man for his growing, and vice versa. This means
that Right Relationship is needed.
Chapter 1 7
LIFE ETERNAL SELF-FULFILLED
As I
study the Circle, I find myself entering a state of consciousness
which reflects the great Hush separating the Consummation and the
Forthgoing in the symbol of the Point. There is a Hush connected with
every symbol. In these regions of Hush the sense of Time entirely dis-
appears, also the sense of Space, and of Spirit and Matter. The Hush,
or No-Movement is ever the background for the Movement to follow.
Chapter 18
THE TRIANGULARITIES
The Men of the Sea within the Circle are triangularities. Thus in
his aspect of God, man is Sat-Chit-Ananda, corresponding to Line-Web-
Point ; in his veiled aspect as man, he is
Rajas-Sattva-Tamas.
SYNOPSIS 125
Chapter 1 9
THE 47TH PROPOSITION OF EUCLID
I see in this a very profound truth expressed as an aspect of the
Law of Adjustment.
Chapter 20
SQUARING THE CIRCLE
From the standpoint of this Yoga, Square and Circle are identical
and interchangeable. And the figure of a Square within a Circle, or a
Circle resting on a Square, represents a mode of manifesting Life. I see
Geometry as a science of everyday life, and in every geometrical
figure a symbol of Man in terms of his evolutionary progress.
Chapter 21
THREE LIFE-STREAMS OF THE ONE GOD
There are three aspects of the Eternal Life the first is the life
that creates, the second is the life that builds, the third is the life that
vitalizes. All three are in the One Life, and all three are One. These
activities are represented by the symbols Point, Web, Line.
Chapter 22
THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CIRCLE
Remember the two functions of the Circle. To fulfil this symbol,
stand forth as the Line, flashing through a world you would conquer to its
happiness. Encircle that world with your will, your wisdom, your active
love, as God drew a Circle to enclose His universe.
Chapter 23
THE CROSS WITHIN THE CIRCLE
The vertical Line vitalizes. The horizontal Line equilibrates. The
Cross is completed within the Circle by simultaneously expressing the
spirit of the two Lines a beautifully poised lightning-flash. The Cross is
a universal symbol of the beginning of the evolutionary process dating
from the beginning of Time, and finding a place in many religions.
Chapter 24
THE SVASTIKA OR WHIRLING CROSS
The Cross-spirit is the background of the Svastika, but it projects
its nature into a revolving Cross. In every symbol there is this projec-
tion, for the Father-Mother spirit in each must give forth the Son. In this
symbol is revealed the marvellous activity of life, of man becoming God.
You may, if
you will try, lose and find yourselves in this cosmic process
this is the gift of the Svastika to you as ordained in this form of Yoga.
126 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
Chapter 25
THE MYRIAD-PETALLED LOTUS
The seventh symbol is a myriad-petalled Lotus, a Lotus which was
in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, a Lotus which is a Universe,
a Sun, a World, a God, a Man. It is a Lotus because the Lotus form
is the supreme and perfect mirror of the fullness of Life. Where
Divinity is, there is the Lotus, and where is Divinity not ?
Chapter 26
SOUND, COLOUR AND FORM RAYS OF THE LOTUS
Every man is characterized by the Sound-Ray, the Colour-Ray and
the Form-Ray of the universe to which he belongs, and no less both by
the Ray of his Archetype and of his Man-uniqueness. But I have also
seen the Lotus of Sound and Light and Form as a Lotus of Fire, with its
petals as flames, and its centre as heat that is white. At birth, and at
death, of each and every person, the Lotus shines as memory of past
achievement and of future triumph. And remembering somewhere, if
not down here, Man moves forward on his appointed way to Godhead.
Chapter 27
THE SILENT WATCHERS
I see the Silent Watchers as a Great Company of Archetypes who
constitute the real Government of the world. And just as each of us
belongs to all Rays, and to one dominantly, so does each of us belong
to all Archetypes, and to one dominantly.
Chapter 28
SUPERCOSMIC SYMBOLS
Pursuing the Line a little way along its curvature into the Infinite, I
see a Cosmic Line, also a Supercosmic Line ; and so in the case of each
and every symbol.
Chapter 29
EACH SYMBOL INVOLVES CREATION
The student creates a standard of forthgoing in the highest regions
of his working consciousness, and the creative spirit is
pure, holy and
sacramental from the very beginning ; and it calls in daily life for a
perfect echo. Anyone seeking to practise this Yoga above, and denying
it below, is doomed to cataclysm.
SYNOPSIS 127
Chapter 30
THE POINT AND ITS DAUGHTER-SYMBOLS
First, the Point in its dual aspect of Consummation and Forthgoing.
Then flash forth the Web that is the Womb of the universe-to-be ; the
Line from north to south, the spine of the universe-to-be ; the Circle-
Globe, which is the body of the universe-to-be ; the horizontal Line,
which makes the Cross in the Circle which is now a Sea of Men ; the
Svastika, giving the hum of a universe at work ; and the Lotus God-
head dawning to its fruition. There are sounds and colours very diffi-
cult to describe characteristic of each symbol.
Chapter 31
THE LABORATORY OF IDENTIFICATION
The Yogi is a well-equipped laboratory. No laboratory on earth
can bring me to a conception of the symbols. Let me then place the
Point within the laboratory which is
my Self, which means that I
identify
myself with each symbol. Thus the Point gives me a sense of omnipo-
'
tent intensity which can pervade limitlessness an identity between the
infinitely small and the infinitely large. The Point is here and now. It is
a universe, and infinitely more. And it has been built of experience-
matter. The Point quivers into an opalescence the Web-Womb of
Creativeness, giving a call to difference, uniqueness. The Line is born ;
or a measurement incarnates the measurement of a man or a universe.
The Circle appears for Limitation-Protection of the evolution-to-be, and
embodies the Call to the Sea of the Unmanifest. The Circle is static
compared to the other symbols. The Cross is the setting of the stage
of evolution ; I see purple, the herald of constructive catastrophe. The
Cross static becomes the Cross dynamic the Svastika, the Friction
Wheel of Salvation. Ignorance is broken upon this wheel of the Love
of God. I see the Lotus, Flower or Fire of Fruition, as symbol of the
attainment by the Men of the Sea of their Godhead. The difference
between one symbol and another is but a difference of mode of life.
Chapter 32
THE YOGA OF INFINITUDES
I have described the Point as Consummation-Forthgoing, but I also
see it as an Infinitude both an infinite Expansion and an infinite Con-
traction. This suggests to me some thoughts and some "
over-thoughts."
Thus infinitude is
everywhere, and God is an Infinitude-Self-Conscious-
ness. Each moment contains Absolute Perfection, there is a goal attained
all the time, and God is a series of Perfections. To us the Relative
is
dynamic, and the Absolute is static. I see that Time-Movement
slowing down becomes Infinitude-intense, and so does Eternity speeded
up. I see the Point as an essence of Time ; the Call of the Point
is both static, as composed of Absolutes, and dynamic as composed
128 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
of Movement ;
and the Call awakens both the Men of the Point and
the Point itself. I have described the Web-Womb as a scintillating net-
work, but I also see it as a long half-opened lily.
So with the other
symbols. And they are not absolutely ultimate, but relatively ultimate.
To describe the Point fully is to describe the seven symbols. Infinitude
and Curvature, Law-Life-Light and other embodiments of the Point, are
inherent in all the symbols. The principle of Curvature suggests the
truth of Universal Relationship ; and I see Reverence, Goodwill and
Compassion as essential qualities of Curvature. Finally,
the vertical and
horizontal Lines give me intriguing ideas of directions and divisions of
our earth-globe.
Chapter 33
A PHYSICAL POSTURE
The Yogi will know how to stand erect as a Line, upright, drawing
from his north the fire of Heaven, and from his south the fire of Earth.
So he reflects the third great symbol of this Yoga, the vertical Line, the
forthpouring of the Third Logos in fecundation of the Sea of the
Unmanifest. And it is the primordial posture in this form of Yoga.
Chapter 34
A GREAT ACT OF YOGA
He was perfectly still ; His state of vibrant ease seemed to compel
the homage of His surroundings, and tune them to the peace which
was theirs to enjoy. From His background of Silence and Darkness,
flashed forth Sound and Light. Thus He fulfilled in Himself some of
the great symbols of this form of Yoga, and by this act of Yoga
released for each Man-wanderer, travelling to his Godhead, a great
Act of Remembrance, the memory that he is God.

whence cometh my help."

As we are thus uplifted, all lower consciousness is
stilled. The noise of the outer world may be round about
us. But it beats in vain upon our stillness. The stillness
is not empty, but still because it is rich with life, rich with
the fullness of life. It is not the absence of sound that
causes true stillness, but a perfection of sound so true,
so delicate, that it
gives us the sense of stillness. It is not
the absence of light that causes true darkness, but a per-
fection of light so true, so infinitely delicate, that it
gives
us the sense of darkness.
It is the stillness whereby alone we can hear the
Silence of the first of the symbols of this form of

of Evolution
Darkness of the first symbol of this form of Yoga. In
this stillness our ears and our eyes, not those of the
physical body but of our highest functioning consciousness,
become attuned to a Silence we have never known before,
and which even now we only know in the blessing of a
Transfiguration.
l
At what are we looking ?
We are looking upon a Radiance which seems to be
a Point,' at a Centre without a circumference, at a Centre
which is
infinitely alive in a sense of the word " Life
"
of
which we have not the slightest conception, a Centre which
is a Radiance, yet does not radiate, a Centre which is but
One, yet embodies an infinitude of
"
Ones," a Centre
which is
infinitely still, yet breathes.
Yes, it is a Point. It is a Point of Silence, a Point of
Darkness ; and somehow we know that this Silence and.
this Darkhess are at once a Fruition, an End, a Consumma-
tion, and a Beginning, a Forthgoing.
We see in this Point the consummation of a mighty
aeon of manifestation, its fruition. It is as if we heard :
Consummatum est ! And then : Let there be Light !
This Point

is the Seed into which a whole aeon of
evolution has become distilled. A Globe-series of evolution-
ary processes has been gathered into a Point-Seed. The
Point has harvested the whole of an evolution in its minutest
details. It is that Central Nucleus round which a Logos
draws a whole system of evolution. He who, among an
infinitude of others, began a Man in the period of a Seed's

THE POINT AS SEED OF EVOLUTION 131
A Fulfilment
and a
Forti, going
The Formula of
God Eternal
What is Truth?
forthgoing has become a God, a Logos, a Word, who shall,
when the Heavens are ready, breathe Himself upon the
surface of the waters of an unmanifest, and Men shall arise
to climb to their Divinities.
A Man who has reached the perfect stature of the
Godhead utters a mantra, a formula, which marks the
fulfilment of his journeyor should I not rather say the
fulfilment of a journey and which marks no less the begin-
ning of a forthgoing to make Men into Gods. He sums
up as in the Gayatri or in the Pranava, as in a concentrated
essence of sound or form or colour, both the Consum-
mation of His Divinity and His directing of such Divinity
upon the Sea of the Unmanifest. Man, as God, enters
into the Silence and the Darkness, moves upwards to heights
still more sublime, and in that very act shines forth upon a
sea like unto the sea of which He formed a part a myriad
light-years ago.
All this is the Point and infinitely more. We gaze
upon our very Selves, upon the formula, the symbol, of
Godhead eternal and everywhere.
In calm power must we strive to hold this stillness in
and of ourselves, lest the vision fade. Only in a stillness
can we hear the Voice of the Silence, and see the Light of
the Darkness.
Through many stillnesses we reach the Silence. If we
can achieve the Yoga of Stillness, and reach our own Yoga
of Silence in the very physical body itself, we are preparing
the way when, as a God, we shall sound the measure of
the physical bodies to be in the new manifestation over
which we shall preside.
And let us remember that this stillness, composed of
stillnesses achieved in every vehicle of our consciousness,
is woven of Truth, of all the venturings which have led us
from our lower into our higher Selves. What is Truth ?
Shall I
reply otherwise than with the Silence which our

Lord the Christ Himself invoked ? Or may I
just suggest
that Truth is that which leads us from a lesser into a larger
light ? Truth is that which beckons us on our way, which
calls us to dynamic movement. Truth is
only "truly"
Truth when, having satisfied us, it ceases to satisfy, when it
causes us to long for light more splendid than the light we
have. Never did Goethe know Truth more than when he
said :
"
Light! More Light!
"
So the stillness is not a static stillness, but a stillness
full of life and restlessness divine. But, you are asking
me, what is this Point which I have been looking at ? Am
I
really looking at an actual Point such as a kind of glorified
full-stop ? Has it substance ? Has it
shape ? Has it some-
thing which, as it were, looks like Silence and Darkness,
and Consummation and Forthgoing ? And what do these
look like, if
they look at all ? The questions are well taken
and must somehow be answered, at least to my own
satisfaction, if not at all to yours.
No, it is not a glorified full-stop. It is a Radiance
which is not yet radiating, but which is
pulsating with the
spirit of Radiance. The Radiance is the essence of God-
head, the fullness of Divinity. It is
infinitely more than
Light. Therefore we call it Darkness. It is
infinitely more
than Sound. Therefore we call it Silence. It is the abstract
of all that is concrete. It is the archetype of all that is
form. I
may call it circular. I
may call it
egg-shaped. I
may give it form, sound, colour. It is the fruition of them
all. It is the seed of them all. It is the acorn and the
oak in one. It
expresses in the great valves of its heart
the Consummation of Godhead and the Forthgoing
of Gods.
Has it substance ? It has substans, which is

is
infinitely vibrant, and within it are multitudes of seeds
of its
very self. As in the seed of the lotus lies the
flower in miniature, so in innumerable seeds lies the Point
in miniature, though I have no understanding whatever as
to their destinies. The Point is a collection of Points, yet
is a Point because of this. There would be no Point but
for its constituent
" Pointnesses." I have a sort of feeling
that I know what they are types of unfathomable origins,
cosmic jig-saw pieces for universe-building, types which
have been the measure of life-unfoldment. They take me
back into primordial negations, as the magic whereby
negation blends into affirmation.
Do you see that I am trying to escape from mind-
conceptions, from Law-conceptions, even from Light-
conceptions,
1
and to go beyond even these majesties into
an essence of Majesty ?
As you read page after page of this book, you should
constantly be remembering that the very symbols I
unveil,
however much they may be described in detail, are
nothing more than symbols, and may or may not, or
may in greater or lesser degree, reflect the life of which
they are formulae. Each symbol has a specific form
presentation and that form presentation may either have
a universal or only a particular significance, or it
may
have both.
As you will find me constantly saying throughout the
book, for on this subject there cannot be too much
reiteration, the symbols, as I describe them, are certainly
true for me, but the question still remains as to whether
they are universally true. I believe they are, at all
events to a certain extent. But it
by no means follows
that each symbol will give to each reader a real conception
of that for which each one is a real conception so far as
I am concerned.

Absolutes and
Relatives
Each Symbol is

But the wise
Reader seeks
Substrata
I tell of a Point, for example ; but when I
say
"
Point/' I am superimposing a symbol-word upon the
very symbol itself. True, the word "Point" expresses
a definite idea. But as an Ultimate we must regard this
idea as an absolute idea on the same principle as we feel
justified in speaking of vacua, even though there be no
such absolute condition. Out of this absolute idea a
relative idea the idea as I see it is drawn. And this
relative idea must not be regarded as the ultimate idea, or
even as a shadow of it. When I
speak of a
"
Point," and
even go so far as to describe it, I am merely describing a
relative conception of it, and in all probability a conception
which is in many ways particular and peculiar to myself,
even though the conception may be in a plane of con-
sciousness far higher than any I can normally reach.
Each symbol I have seen in a state of Yoga, and
to that extent it is
justifiable to say that each symbol is
by
no means merely a mind-conception, or a feeling, or an
intuition. Each is certainly more than this, for it involves
a state of consciousness which I can only reach at rare
intervals. We may perhaps therefore look upon each
symbol as being less personal than if it were a product of
the ordinary waking consciousness. Each is indeed a
conception induced by Yoga. But to each individual his
own Yoga, and therefore each conception in Yoga must in
some degree be personal, be individual, to the particular
observer.
What I am really doing when I write of a Point or of
the other symbols, and even when I am trying to describe
each, can only be to try to set up a vibratory-motif
which each reader must interpret according to his own
values. He will not gain any real benefit from reading this
book unless, while receptive to the stimulus it contains, he
moulds its vibrations to his own rate of living, and so creates
or constructs his own Lotus Fire, his own Symbolic Yoga.
THE POINT AS SEED OF EVOLUTION 135

Fragrance of
Sublimation
A Song of
fulfilment
All this is not, however, to suggest that there is not a
definite substratum of universal value even in the very
form and description of each symbol. But the wise reader
will seek through the form and the description the very
substratum itself.
For my own part, I think that what I have described
is a truth as to cosmic Ultimates. I do not hesitate to say
that I have, in a condition of Yoga, perceived in some
measure some of these Ultimates. I have seen Ultimates
which are universal, common to all life. The symbols I
describe are certainly true for me, and may therefore be
said to be my formulae of the evolutionary process. But
the formulae true for one may have less validity for another.
I shall be most happy if, in a measure stirred by my own
formulae, a reader discovers his own, and becomes exalted
by them, as I am exalted by mine. How wonderful it
would be if each reader could write at least a monograph
on his Symbobgy of the Ultimates. There might be some-
thing marvellous in a composite picture of the various
symbols that various students have been able to discover.
But you must remember that, only as you conjure
stillnesses from out your experiences, and suffuse your
whole being with the fragrance of sublimation after sub-
limation, can you hope to know the Point not as I have
known it, but as your own distinct uniqueness must
know it.
I can but try to create an atmosphere, a gossamer
line between you and the Point, which you must vitalize by
an act of Yoga.
In the Point all sublimations have been fulfilled. They
are in the Point in a consummation of Yoga. They sing
the song of their fulfilment ; and hearing the song, in the
Sea of the Unmanifest, are prototypes beginning to be busy
about the magic they in their turn have to perform.
Through such magic a negation will once more blend into
136 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
an affirmation. The " Men
"
of the Sea are awakening to
their
" Manness."
This Point is the Essence, the Supreme Macrocosm,
and the Supreme Microcosm not only of Being, but of
Non-Being also.
Upwards and Jo put the whole idea very baldly and crudely, you
Outwards
must imagine yourself reaching the end of the evolutionary
process, far beyond the stage of the Master, far beyond
the stage of most of the high Initiations with which we are
familiar, if not all of them. There is a point at which an
individual achieves, consummates, his Divinity whatever
Divinity may mean, I do not at all know. At this point,
two things happen : He proceeds onwards and upwards ;
but as he has received, so does he give. That is the whole
idea of the twofold nature of this metaphysical Point. He
achieves his Divinity and, in so achieving, branches out in
two directions. The one direction is
upwards into future
unfoldment, and the second is the sounding forth of some
stupendous note which is his note, and has been his note
from the very beginning, so that the rhythm of the sound-
ing forth of that note begins to call into being a universe
of Men, because every constituent particle is a Man with a
capital
"
M," and the process of evolution is for the Man.
to become a God. The Man descends into the Elemental
Kingdoms, becomes Mineral, Vegetable, Animal, Man, and
the Man becomes a God.
Out of the Sea of the Unmanifest, in the vibration of
this Note, gathers together a manifestation of Men. I re-
gard this Forthgoing as Creative Activity straining at the
leash. You have a sense of perfect poise of the athlete
waiting for the sound of the gun to start him on the
race. The poise is remarkable for its intensity. When one
looks at this Point, one is
quite unable to go with it
up-
wards, but being also an element of the Sea of the Unmani-
fest, there is a certain innate familiarity with the nature of
THE POINT AS SEED OF EVOLUTION 137
the Forthgoing. So one concentrates immediately on that,
and then one sees the marvellous poise of the Athlete,
with a capital
"
A," straining at the leash.
The Point is a You must, however, also remember that I am looking
Universal
upon the Point in terms of my individuality, however much
of the higher consciousness may be concentrated in my
gaze. The Point is a Universal, even though pervaded by
Individuality. But I am still at the stage of learning how to
be an individual, how to be my individual self. The spirit
of Self-conscious individuality has yet to be in flower with-
in me. Still more, therefore, has the spirit of Universal-
ity to be in flower. Necessarily, therefore, I must needs
colour my vision of the Point 'with my individual self, and
the Point loses accordingly.

becomes more
warmly Human
The supreme Point sends forth a light of such transparency,
limpidity and subtlety that it
penetrates everywhere. The Zohar
Is there a Consummation and a Forthgoing every moment ?
In some mysterious way is there a Flower and a Seed in every
moment of living ? Is an old cycle being closed and a new cycle
being opened in every instant of our lives ?
Remembering all this, I must now ask you to realize
that this Yoga of Sublimation, which carries you onwards to
the heights, is an act in which the whole of your fellow-life
in every kingdom shares. No one can grow alone, and the
way of the Yogi, far from taking him away from his
fellow-life, not only draws him more closely to it but draws
it with him, so that as he grows, so does all that lives, each
life where it is on the wider way.
As the Yogi moves slowly towards the far-off regions
of the Super-human, he becomes more truly and warmly
human, and more truly and warmly sub-human as well. He
draws nearer to his fellow-men, nearer to the animal king-
dom, nearer to the vegetable kingdom, nearer to the
mineral kingdom. He draws nearer to all who suffer and
who are held awhile in the despairs of life. He draws
nearer to all life, and stirs it to move more quickly to
the kingship that awaits it, as he is
drawing more closely
to his own.
To look upon the Point with true understanding, it
is needful that we should have purified our gaze with an
THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE POINT 139

of Nature

Ascended

understanding of those who are travelling with us on the
pathway of life. We cannot understand the More save in-
sofar as we are understanding the Less. To understand
the nature of the Point we must understand the nature of
the life we share with all
things ; and the Point cannot help
us save as we help others.
One of the most significant ingredients of a vision of
the Point is that which causes us to bring all nature to the
act of reverence. We do not stand alone to worship. We
do not stand with our individual selves alone. We conjure
every kingdom of life to stand with us. So do we, as in-
dividualized, universalize in some measure our gaze, thus
bringing the like to look upon the like.
In this connection I should like to draw your attention
to a most interesting article which appeared in the April
1935 issue of The Jheosophist. It is entitled "The Master
Ascended," and describes how One who is
stepping from
the human kingdom to the kingdom beyond achieves a
triumph, not for Himself alone, but for the whole of the
Life that is
evolving with His. Not only does He achieve a
victory, but because of His victory, all Life moves onwards
through yet another triumph. Nearer to all that lives does
He draw, but nearer to the Goal, at their various and re-
spective levels, draw the Monads, who in the beginning
were received into the communion of the new manifesta-
tion. Nearer to the Goal do they all draw because He has
drawn nearer, and because Life is one and indivisible, as is
the Light, even though it becomes the Rainbow.
I would ask you to read that article,
1
for It reveals a
veritable Yoga of that ascent which all living things make
together, even though differently. Yoga

is Union the
incarnation of Unity and Union the Son returns to Unity
the Father, on the splendid way so graphically described.

Us
In the light of this understanding, let us once again
gaze upon the Point, and try to see what more we may
perchance perceive.
Perhaps we are discovering the Point to be no longer
without us, but in some mystery we do not fathom we dis-
cover it within us, part of our Being. Are we in the outer
court of the Eternal ? Do we suddenly find ourselves at
home?
I think that only as the Point without us unites with
the Point within, shall we be able to know a little more.
But it is indeed true that, as we gaze upon the Point ap-
parently without us, the very vision will reveal to us not
only the Point within, but the wondrous universality of the
Point in all manifestation, and in the unmanifest no less.

In his fascinating Space, T/'me and Gravitation, Sir Arthur
Eddington writes of what he calls the "point-event" as
one of the most elementary concepts of nature. He de-
scribes it as an instant of time at a point of space. But in
terms of Yoga we see this point-event as elementary not
only in the sense of its being cosmically primordial, but no
less in the sense of its being cosmically ultimate the end
as well as the beginning, the whole as well as the part, the
universal as well as the individual. It is
nothing less, in its
primordial aspect, than a mode of undifferentiated infinity,
while in its fulfilment it is a mode of infinity self-realized.

movement-potentiality of the Eternal, and Time its in-

In any case, the Point exists in its infinity, in its sum-
mation of a Past and a Future in an undifferentiated Pres-
ent, by grace of a magic of Time and Space within a
limitless Eternity.
1
By such grace the Point symbolizes for us an infinity of
Potentiality based on an aeon of Consummation. There is
Man become God. There is a Silence and a Darkness.
There are the eternal Archetypes. There is the Radiance
as yet undifferentiated. There is the cosmic Hush as the
bridge between an evolution concentrated, distilled, into a
Point and an evolution as yet to unfold. The Radiance is
pregnant with radiation. The Silence is pregnant with
sound. The Darkness is
pregnant with light. God is
preg-
nant with Divinity. An All has become merged in a One.
An Infinity which has become undifferentiated out of differ-
entiation is
pregnant with the seed of infinite potentiality.
All that was is distilled into the Point. All that is to be is
potential in the Point.
Yet as we reach out into these inaccessibilities, for
it is
good to reach out, though we cannot hope to
reach, let us ponder over the mighty words of the
Lord Buddha :

their respective points in the process, but the student who
is climbing to the heights will recognize those which sound
in his inner ear, as he draws near to the summit :

can be seen by the lower consciousness. As the rainbow
thrills into its resolution, I seem to hear a dull rumbling
l

Light departing into its
primordial Darkness.
How reminiscent is a physical-plane storm, with its
crashing thunder and piercing lightning, of these tran-

in attendance on that sublimity of consciousness which I am
calling a Point, there are the Mightiest of Beings, as there
are angels and devas attendant upon, revelling in, recreat-
ing in, a storm of our outer world.
Are there the Deva-Angels of the Point and of every
other symbol in this form of Yoga ? I am sure there are.
But They are beyond my sight, though I feel as if I could
discern Silent Watchers even in these formless heights.
Must we not, as we seek to translate the Point in
terms appropriate to our usage, reflect in some wise the
cosmic thunder we have heard, and the cosmic lightning
we have seen ? For my own part the reflection comes to
me as a rumbling of my own consciousness, a tuning of

my consciousness to react to notes beyond my normal
scale of living. There is, as it were, a stretching of the
consciousness so that it contains more, and I think of Walt
Whitman's cataclysmic poem wherein he says :
" I am
large. I contain multitudes."
Thus do we come to that condition of Being so
vividly described in the last two verses of Light on the Path :
" Listen only to the voice which is soundless. Look only on
that which is invisible alike to the inner and the outer
sense." I remember the fourth Stanza of Dzyan wherein
the significant phrase
"
No-Number
"
is used, and I
say to
myself :
"
No-Sound,"
"
No-Light." But there is no negation
whatever. It is only the poverty of language which forces us
to measure the immeasurable with negations. The phrases
should be "
More-than-Sound,"
"
More-than-Light."
Sound has an infinitude of scales, and so has Light.
Have Silence and Darkness these scales and more ? There
is something about each which gives me a strange impres-
sion that there is a vast region which these two cosmic
states include about which I can know nothing whatever,
nor even a Master of the Wisdom until He reaches one of
the further heights in inter-stellar spaces.

the Yoga which shall guide us on our way :
This Form of Mine beholden by thee is
very hard to see.
Verily the Shining Ones ever long to behold this Form.
Nor can I be seen as thou hast seen Me by the Vedas, nor
by austerities, nor by alms, or by offerings :
But by devotion to Me alone I
may thus be perceived, Arjuna,
and known and seen in essence, and entered, O Parantapa.
He who doeth actions for Me, whose supreme good I am,
My devotee, freed from attachment, without hatred of any being,
he cometh unto Me, O Pandava.
I ask you to note the words "known and seen in-
essence, and entered/' and how the path of Forthgoing,
on which are strawn the rocks of constructive hatred, must
be succeeded by the path of Return, glorified by the
fulfilling flowers of love.
It is to the essence of things that Yoga leads us, and
I think the idea of the Point is
given us in order to suggest
the idea of essence. But it is the essence of all, an undis-
criminative not a discriminative essence which we must
draw into our Point. This fact must receive due emphasis
in a world which needs division and comparison, which
needs to choose between paths, between what is called right
and wrong, which needs universal standards and codes and
conventions. But to the Yogi all life is one, and naught can
be excluded from sublimation into its perfect essence.
We gain just a glimpse of the background of the
Point in the second Stanza of The Book of Dzyan :
. . . Where was Silence? Where the ears to sense
it ? No, there was neither Silence nor Sound ; naught save Cease-
less Eternal Breath, which knows itself not.

This is more than what we call Pralaya, for Pralaya is
but a form of this Ceaseless Eternal Breath of God. And
even here, as in a flash of outreaching, the words come to
us :
"
Suspended Breath of God." What these words
mean I do not know, but I do know that we are in the
presence of what may well and truly be called an awful
mystery, no more to be conceived than that absolute nega-
tion both of manifestation and non -manifestation towards
which certain types of Yogis irresistibly grope.
Let us leave these tremendous regions and seek in
some measure to know the already Everestian height of this
essence- Point, the first symbol of the Yoga with which we
are here concerned.
I think we must first agree as to the "
tangibility
"
of
the Silence and the Darkness so characteristic of the Point.
The Point is alive with Silence and Darkness, and pregnant
with Sound and Light. In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God, and God became the Word.
But this is a later stage. I
only advert to it here so that
we may remember that the Point is
supremely Silence,
with Darkness, as I have already suggested, girt about, and
that Sound precedes Light. In this connection we may
also advert to the first chapter of Genesis where it is said
that
" darkness was upon the face of the deep."
*
Darkness
being thus primordial, God said,
" Let there be Light : and
there was Light."
Can you even here and now, somehow, perhaps with
the adjusting aid which these observations may possibly
afford you, flash yourselves into a sense of this tangibility
of Silence and Darkness, gaining some faint reaction from
their cosmic substance ?
Perchance you may in some small degree partake
of the "
ecstasy by the divine Spirit" of St. John, whereby

he entered into the thunder and the lightning, and gave forth
his In Principle erat Verbum : "In the beginning was the
Word." H. P. Blavatsky declares in a foot-note on p. 131
of the third volume of The Secret Doctrine (Adyar ed., V,
143) :
"
We have never heard of extasis producing thunder
and lightning and we are at a loss to understand the
meaning." In all
humility I think that this very ascent
into the Point is
accompanied by a mystic thunder and
lightning wholly comparable to its
physical counterpart. I
have already quoted from The Voice of the Silence the
passage in which reference is made to the "
dull rumbling
of a thunder-cloud." And so far as my own experiences
attest, there is a certain form of Yoga, some of the higher
reaches of which seem to have a setting of semi-cosmic
thunder and of lightning, so that the appellation gained by
St. John of "Son of Thunder" is that of all who have
attained such regions.
Can you conceive of this Point as the non-material,
super-material, matrix of manifestation, of the evolutionary
process ? Certainly, with the potent aid of the accumulated
transubstantiations of each state of consciousness, you will be
able in some measure to do this. But even now you should
have entered into a certain poise and balance, so that you
are able to hold yourselves for a moment in that state of
suspended forthgoing, whereby you become free to contact
an Ultimate Essence of the very Forthgoing itself.
You may possibly, if
you are adventurers, have tried
to imagine the whole of the manifest universe blotted out.
Suppose there were No-Selves in addition to No-Number,
No-Sound, No-Light, No-Thing. It is a devastating effort
to make to wipe out the whole of the process. In fact
you cannot quite do it, because you have not the where-
withal, because you are you, but if
you can in a little
momentary flash of imagination deceive yourself that you
are conceiving of nothing, of no evolutionary process at
150 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
all, of absolute negation (only negation is an unfortunate
word because it
suggests affirmation), if
you can get some-
where near the No-Thing, because extremes meet, then
you are somewhere near the Everything, just as the tail
of the serpent goes into its mouth. This is an interesting
meditation. Out of the No-Thing to be able to contact
the Everything. It is
very difficult, and you must stop if
it produces any disturbance whatever, though it is an
extremely valuable attempt. Be it understood, then,
that although we speak of a Forthgoing, in truth the
Whole goes forth in the part, and yet remains the
Whole. In every part the Whole is
dwelling, and to
unseeing eyes seems but a fragment of Itself. In the
tenth discourse of The Bhagavad G/ta, Shri Krishna thus
resolves this paradox :
"
Having pervaded this whole
universe with one fragment of Myself, I remain." There is
no part apart from its Whole.

potentialities a Silence and a Darkness straining against
the leash of movementless Poise. There is no perceptible
content other than Silence and Darkness each of these
vibrant, however, with an undifferentiated infinitude of
octaves of sound and of light, with unimaginable permuta-
tions and combinations of their respective contents.
How the Silence and the Darkness are related I do
not yet know, but in his fascinating book, Through Space
and 7/me, Sir James Jeans tells us that
" we shall not go
far wrong if we think of the seven colours
l
of the spectrum
as the seven notes of a scale, red being C, orange D,
yellow E, green F, and so on." In any case, we gain a
glimpse of our limitations when we remember that our eyes

can perceive only one octave of light and our ears hear only
eleven octaves of sound. Science has, of course, increased
our perceptive power, and if I am not mistaken over seventy-
three octaves of vibration may now be investigated. In
parenthesis, it is
surely high time for science to reach the
conclusion that the next real step forward in scientific
unfoldment is to study the various states of consciousness,
with a view to enabling them to do of themselves that
which now has to be done by external physical instruments.
That which we can create we already are.
I should make quite clear that while from one point of
view I think I have correctly described the Point as
" move-
mentless Poise," from another angle of Truth, we must ever
remember that
"
Ceaseless Eternal Breath
"
which, so far
as we know, pervades all the Eternities, all the Infinitudes,
all the Unmanifests, all the Manifests, of which we can have
any conception. Therefore, the idea of
" movementless
Poise
"
must be used only to suggest that tension of
potency which is so characteristic of these regions of Ulti-
mates. Just as excess of light, using the word "excess"
with reference to our own limited powers of vision, is dark-
ness, so excess of movement is movementlessness. The
very words "Silence" and "Darkness" are words we
use in order to indicate that we have reached vibratory
conditions infinitely beyond our comprehension.
" Silence
"
and "
Darkness
"
are the answers of consciousness to
vibrations which not only transcend the powers of the
physical organs, but no less transcend all states of con-
sciousness in which we are able to function. Perhaps
there is no Silence and no Darkness anywhere. Yet
must we convey as best we can the impressions we
receive.
Every symbol in this form of Yoga must needs breathe
with the Ceaseless Breath
[
of God, for it is a symbol of,

bols are parts of their Realities. The Point breathes. The
Web-Womb breathes. The Lines breathe. The very Circle

The Lotus breathes. Each symbol breathes, and they
breathe simultaneously as well as successively. I wonder if
I dare suggest that the nearest approach to this cosmic
breathing portrayed on the physical plane is that of the
jellyfish, partly because there is such tenuousness of body,
and partly because the inbreathing and the outbreathing
seem so much to be all-pervading.
And these breathings, whether belonging to symbols
of the unmanifest or of the manifest, have in them all the
elements of the Sound that is Silence, of the Light that is
Darkness, as well as of the Silence that is Sound and Form,
and of the Darkness that is
Light and Fire. For, above all
else, the student of Yoga learns, experiences, that there is
naught outside the One, howsoever we may define this
supremely occult symbol. We use words Manifest, Un-
manifest, Silence, Darkness, Sound, Light, and all the rest
but all are within the One.
We may thus imagine how ineffably glorious and
inconceivably alive are the states I will not say of con-
sciousness which are sought to be made feebly, so very
feebly, visible through the symbols which veil the excess of
their glory. But why do I at all use the word " alive
"
?
Why should I
pretend that to be alive is so much more
splendid than to be not-alive ? Human beings not, I think,
other beings have, quite naturally, become so confused by
small conceit as to imagine that to be alive with the utmost
power and fullness of being is to be awake on the physical
plane. Life is confined, in this conceit, to the physical plane
alone, while death is the antithesis of life. I wonder how
long it will take us to realize that there is a garden beyond
the prison of our physical existence. Life is
everywhere.

So do I ask you to embark upon a great reaping and

mation of those and other fields in the Point-Essence of
Potential Life. The more truly you perceive, with increasing
spiritual acreage as field after field of Life becomes your
own, the more will your growing be hastened until at long
last you enter into the Temple of your Godhead, to go
forth no more, until the time is set for you, a God, to give
your Godhead to a waiting Sea of Life.
Everything you are doing now and at any other time is
a ploughing, a reaping, a harvesting, for fruition in the Point.

is this wondrous Silence and Darkness, and within each one
of us dwells the Lord of Deliverance whereby we shall

shall become. In the beginning was the Word we knew
not. At an end shall be the Word we know. In the
beginning was the Word we heard and which awakened
us. At an end shall be the Word we shall speak to awaken,
as we ourselves were awakened.

of the other symbols is to help you to understand yourself

How, in what way, can you conjure out of your daily
living some faint note of the Silence, some faint ray of the
Darkness, some suggestion of the Radiance ?
I think that, if
you seek, you will find occasions
wonderfully reflective of the mystery of the Point.

Reflect on that Silence, for example, into which the
whole of nature hushes at eventime, when the night rises
in its
majesty, the day rests, when the notes of the birds are
stilled, the breezes become soft, and life seems to withdraw
into its inbreathing.
The Yoga of the Day has been fulfilled, and the Yoga
of the Night once more comes forth into that action which
is the very life of Yoga.
The sounds of the day depart, giving place to the
stillnesses of the night, broken only by those sounds which
reveal to us that in the very Silence music dwells.
Watch while the Yoga of Light melts into the Yoga of
Darkness. Watch while the light around you seems to
disappear, hushing the winds, hushing the rustling of the
trees, softening all outlines, resolving the colours of flowers
into their darknesses. Watch all outer life and activity as
it withdraws in the very spirit of Yoga into rest and still-
ness. Watch the workers as they hurry homewards, them-
selves almost seeming to merge into the twilight and the
darkness.
Watch all
objects round you as they disappear one by
one into their darknesses the trees, the shrubs, the
bushes, the grass, the very buildings themselves, and
the roads.
Here you see before your very eyes an act of the
Universal Yoga in which the life about you lives and moves
and has its being.
Can you cause the spirit of the Point to flow into this
Yoga, so that the Point, as you know it in abstraction,
becomes a living concrete reality?
I- think you will be able to do this as you yourself
seek to become one with this act of Yoga, joining your
substance to its
growing inertia, poised and will-full. You
see the river of light flowing into a sea of darkness. Float
upon this river, and let yourself drift into the sea in an

infinite exaltation of darkly silent consciousness, thus to
identify yourself with an aspect of the Point in which
Light is not yet born from Darkness, nor Sound from
Silence, in the midst of which God has not yet said :
" Let
there be Light."
If
you can achieve this meditation, you will touch, as
in a flash, the Universal Law that is Buddhi, and it will
descend into you in its partial aspect of what we call the
intuition,
1
awakening you to the Truth that you are in all
things, that you are one with them. And perhaps for a
single moment, which will seem as an Eternity, you will
move one step further inwards and contact that Universal
Light that is Nirvana, so that the whole world will be within
you, One as you are, but as you still have to discover your-
self to be, so that you will awaken to the Truth that all
things are in you, that they are one with you.
When these two Truths are really yours, and you are
theirs, then will you know the Point, and the Point shall
know itself in you.
Then, too, shall you understand the beautiful truth of
the Gopis dancing with Shri Krishna, He the Universal One
and therefore the Perfect Many.
But this is
only one of the many memories of the
Point in incarnation in the worlds of form.
Each one of us has his supreme moments often
evoked by apparent trivialities, but often by external majes-
ties. Since all these supreme experiences are within us,
as it were, already, so that from the larger-consciousness
point of view there is no need to wait for them, therefore
they can be evoked, and often are evoked entirely inde-
pendently of our striving to achieve them. Each person
generally has his own particular line of approach of least
resistance to his sublimities. If
you make a study of the
lives of geniuses, you will find that each great genius

whether he be a musician, a painter or a sculptor, or
perhaps a poet has his own lines of least resistance
to reach the summits of himself before he has attained
them.
At certain times the rhythm of a moving railway train
will reveal to me a symbol of this Yoga. Certain motifs in
music, a single note thundering in a stillness, the hum of
insects on a warm and still afternoon, a poem with a rhythm
akin to my own such as that of Hiawatha or of Myers*

a sound surging within myself and flooding my
being, some exquisite structure, alive or living, a very Silence
or Darkness within myself : all these and many other things
will stir my consciousness, and awaken it to the wonders of
its being which these symbols seek to portray. You should
be attached to your own inspiration on account of its
dominant rhythm. Each artist, each creation of an artist,
has a dominant rhythm. You will be attracted to one or
another artist, to one or another creation, on account of
its, to you, congenial rhythm a rhythm which is in tune
with your own. It is
interesting to take sculptures, paint-
ings, operas, ragas, melodies and symbols, and arrange
them in octaves according to the notes they seem to you
to sound. Through these various ways sound will surge
within you and flood your being. In Samskrit verse Rhythm
reaches its apotheosis. Samskrit is a dance, every letter
releasing a rhythm, and only when you hear a Samskrit word
do you perceive how intensely rhythmic sounds can be.
And then there are those great moments, those, to
us, supreme moments of remembrance of the Divinity of
Life, which come to all whose souls have become old
enough to remember. More than one of the great Savi-
ours of the world has revealed to the gaze of us all do

we see or are we still blind ? mighty peaks of remembrance
as in the glorious Eucharists of Hinduism and Christianity.
Witness indeed are these stupendous acts of Union to the
truth of the words which every Saviour has spoken, and
which find in Christ the Comforter the words :
" Lo ! I
shall be with you to the end of the world."
The true Buddhist knows of the great ceremony of
Wesak,
1
during the full moon of the month of May, in a
land amidst the Himalayas, when the Flower of earth's
humanity, the Lord Buddha, permits some among His
devotees to enter into an annual Eucharist with Him. There
are those who attend this Eucharist in their physical bodies.
There are those who attend it otherwise. To all not only is
the experience unforgettable, but even more an indescrib-
able strength.
Then there is the glorious Eucharist of the Christian
faith, at the supreme moment of which there is the ecstasy
of very communion with the Lord Christ Himself, For a
moment the devotee partakes of the Christ-nature, is lifted
up to Him as by a miracle of Yoga, so that he knows him-
self to be a Christ and all around him to participate in the
very life of the Christ.
These two Eucharists I know personally. There are
others, I am sure, no less sublime."
Cannot those who also know these miracles of Yoga
use them to know the mighty symbol of the Point ?
I am very sure that in each of you there are such
stirrings, and I ask you to utilize them to the purpose of
awakening in you intimations of some of the glories at
least of your Higher Selves, of which these symbols them-
selves are expressions and formulae.
The whole purpose of the Point and of all the other sym-
bols is for the adjustment of each one of us, a Man-God,

Each symbol
releases Memory, that Line of Divinity upon which are
strung the beads of experience from the beginning to the
end. We always relate
" I remember

to the past. We
shall really be Yogis when we relate that phrase to the
future no less than to the past. When we have learned to
remember our future, as we think we have remembered
the past, we are well on the way to the real future. Once
we can say with full truth,
" I
remember," forwards into the
future, backwards into the past, poised in the present, we
know Infinity and That whence all symbols shine forth.
Every process in this form of Yoga must be real. It
must enter into the waking consciousness, and be brought
into intimate association with the mountain ranges of in-
dividual living in the outer worlds.
Yoga is experience, and in these regions of the greater
Real, Truth must be garnered as Life, so that in the regions
of the lesser Real it
may be perceived in forms. I do not
know why I have used the words "
greater and lesser Real,"
since Reality is one. But its texture varies, and we there-
fore differentiate between the textures.
If, then, you are able to discover in your own individ-
ual lives counterparts of these eternal verities, in some cases
being able to contact them with the very organs of the
senses, you will be inspired to return to the inner regions,
and to contact even its abstractions with concrete organs of
the senses raised to their abstract power,
Do not please think you cannot contact the intangible
with the tangible. That is one of the greatest of mistakes.

merely a Christian statement but antedates Christianity by many thousands

that I have been able to get what I have gotten.

Nearer than hands and feet must you be to each con-

a difference.
Do not think for a moment that you are enter-

accompanies the outflowing life as it moves towards its
Circumference. At the Centre, tangibility achieves its
apotheosis.
Do not allow yourselves to become confused by the
thought that you are now in the regions of the non-material,
and that therefore contact cannot be as in what we call the
regions of matter.
Matter is but the slow motion of the Eternal
Spirit. The contact we know in these outer worlds is
but the slow motion of the Identity we experience in
the inner worlds.
Time is but the slow motion of Eternity, Space is
but the slow motion of the Unmanifest. Sound is the
slow motion of Silence, and Light of Darkness.
More substantial than matter is Spirit, than contact

Eternity, than space is the Un-

light is Darkness.

encountered a Silence-Darkness and a Radiance for which
we seek in our regions of form some faint shadow.
How shall we break through the selves of our Selves,
reaching those Selves and raising them to their loftiest
Being ? How shall we become still in these vastnesses of
dark infinitude, of leashed omnipotence, of well-nigh over-
whelming immanence, of purest Being ? How, with our
finiteness, with our individuality, with our sounds and our

light, with our forms and our time and our space, shall we
know that which is
supremely more than any of them ?
I will confess to you that I have tried, with my
imagination
]
the power that builds bridges to Heaven,
and hurls over precipices into Hell and with all the magic
that in me lies, to enter into the Point in all spiritual
endeavour and reckless adventure. I
say to myself :
"
Pre-Silence." I
say to myself:
"
Pre-Darkness."" I
say to myself:
" Pre-Radiance." For I think --of course
I do not think at all, but the weak word slips out to show
me that I am still
entangled in the realms of the mind-
enslaved I
" think
"
that if I resolve within an imagining
of supreme ascent, I shall catch a shadow from these
negations of my loftiest summits.
The shadow that does come is
pictured in the magni-
ficent phrase of the second Stanza of Dzyan,
"
Ceaseless
Eternal Breath." This is infinitude. This is undifferentia-
tion. This is infinite potentiality.
It is reckless work. You see these negations are at
the loftiest limit, and one tries to show that any Supreme
Conception one may reach is
only the shadow of a shade.
The next best thing, if we cannot do that, is to find the
bridge between those Supreme Negations and ourselves
through that Ceaseless Breath of God, of which our
own breath in its rhythm is but a reflection, yet a
true reflection.
Can you not enter into your own actual physical
breathing and vibrate to its even rhythm? One splendid
way of healing is to externalize yourself in your breath
rhythm.

Can you not enter into the physical breathing of all
that is around you in every kingdom of nature ? Can you
not enter into the breathing of our Mother Earth ? Can
you not then project this intensity of universal breathing
into the spaces and join in the breathing of the stars ?
Can you not thus enter into the breathing of your universe,
and so join in the breathing of universes uncountable ? Can
you know, feel, that nowhere does the breathing stop,
and that you are but reproducing in a microcosm that
which pervades a macrocosm ?
]
Yes. The Ceaseless Eternal Breath is the formlessness
and the form both of undifferentiated infinity and infinite
potentiality.
It is the Father-Mother of Silence and of Darkness.
It is the heart of that Duration which is the progenitor of
Time. It is the seed of that Undifferentiation which is the
progenitor of Space.
I have purposely omitted the qualifying clause to the
phrase
"
Ceaseless Eternal Breath," so as to avoid a sense
of confusion. But now I must just refer to it
" which
knows itself not." I do not feel happy about the comment
on this phrase in The Secret Doctrine.
2
This comment seems
to me to entangle us among the ordinary definitions of
consciousness, applying them to a condition which can only
be called the Pre-conscious, using this word in its sense of
a transcendence of the totality of that which we call
Consciousness. 4<
Which knows itself not," to my under-
standing, means but an absence of descent into its counter-
part, reflection, on the plane of relative manifestation. And
when we are told in the same comment that
"
infinity can-
not comprehend finiteness," we must be careful not to
understand the word "
comprehend
"
in any ordinary sense.
Infinity must in some wise comprehend finiteness on its own

plane, for surely finiteness is a mode of the very Being of
infinitude. Yet, trarscendentally, we may agree with the
statement, just as as we might say that Eternity cannot
comprehend Time.
The Ring-Pass- | can he|p yOU no more m these regions. But
perhaps you have already journeyed into them with me,
and have known the Ceaseless Breath of God. But in

Chapter 8
THE POINT OUR UNFOLDED SELF
An Intricate
Concept
Forthgomg-
Consummation
an Hour-Glass
This is the first truth and this also the last . . The Point
came forth before all things it was neither atomic nor mathemat-
ical, being a diffused Point. The Monad manifested explicitly but
a myriad were implied There was light and there was darkness,
beginning and the end thereof, the all and naught, being and
non-being. --Eugenius Philalethes
At the risk of prolonging your attention upon this
first symbol of this form of Yoga, I must comment yet a
little more on the Point, especially now that you will be
finding ways and means of approximating to it somewhat
more closely than probably you had thought possible.
I should like to make clear that we must entirely
abandon our normal preconceptions regarding space-areas.
In these more ultimate regions, neither space nor time
have any relevancy. A Point is not, by reason of its
supposed size, an elementary concept. Cn the contrary,
it is the most intricate concept there is. We call it a Point
because of its infinite concentration, be the area infinitely
large or infinitely small, and because it is the Centre not only
of an infinitude of circumferences, but also of an infinite
series both of converging and of expanding rings or globes.
In this connection, I sometimes think of an hour-glass lying
horizontally, with its series of converging circles on the one
side, the Point in the middle, and an expanding series of
circles on the other side. The size of the hour-glass
depends on what sized circle you represent here and now.
But the hour-glass I am looking at extends infinitely on
THE POINT OUR UNFOLDED SELF 169

"
either side of its central Point. The left-hand side of the
hour-glass symbolizes the Consummation, while the right-
hand side symbolizes the Forthgoing.
You stand at the Point of an hour-glass with expanding
circles on either side. From the left-hand side, achieve your
Consummation aspect, all that you have ever been. From
the right-hand side, draw into yourself all you have yet
to achieve of Forthgoing, all
you will ever be. Achieve
that in the Now of your Eternal Being. For the Point
is the primordial symbol containing in its nature all
the rest.
Let me also say that in the Point we contact a state
of Causelessness insofar as the word is
permissible, which
I
very much doubt which does not mean that Cause is
suspended, or has ceased to be, but that there is no Cause
as we know Cause in these outer regions of the Divine
Life. There is no Movement. There is No-Movement,
which is as much more than Movement as Darkness is more
than Light, and Silence more than Sound. Thus, Cause-
lessness becomes more than Cause.
I want very specially to insist that evolution may be
summed up in the one word "
More," and that the higher
the stage of evolution the greater the acceleration of the
"
More." As life passes through kingdom after kingdom
of nature, its growth accelerates, until in the superhuman
kingdoms its rate of advance is more rapid than any rate
of growth with which we are familiar. The distances to be
traversed become vaster and vaster, but the travelling
becomes quicker and quicker.
The Law of Acceleration seems to be in operation
first in the last stages of every kingdom of nature, and
second the nearer an individuality or Man draws to his
Centre. On such occasions there is what may be called
a
"
speeding up
"
of the evolutionary process, of which the
individuality becomes conscious. This is a working of
170 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
the real Law of Gravitation, the Principle of Curvature,
with the physical counterpart of which we are so
familiar.
In the cosmic regions the More is
stupendous, and
we should be gravely wrong were we to think that
anywhere there is real cessation of Movement. If there
seems to be a standing-still, it is because the movement is
rapid beyond the estimation of every sight that we possess
physical sight, emotional sight, the sight of the mind,
the sight of Law, of Light, of Life.
The Point at its own level becomes a specific
"
More,"
but of such " More
"
we can know naught.
The Point I cannot ask you to imagine. It is un-
imaginable. It must not be imagined from one point of
view. In the condition of your highest consciousness you
may gain some conception of it.
A Yoga of It is not a negation, but an affirmation, for this form
Affirmation r w \/ r
or Yoga is not a Yoga of any negation at any time any-
where. It is a Yoga of Affirmation. It is not a Yoga of
withdrawal, but it is a Yoga of Gathering-in. In most of
the books on Yoga, it is a Yoga whereby you withdraw and
withdraw and withdraw. This Yoga is a Yoga whereby
you gather and gather aftd gather. You must leave
nothing, be it a weakness or be it a strength, be it a
light or be it a darkness, be it a sound or be it a
silence.
There is
nothing to be left behind, for all is
experience.
But we need not put our feet on rungs on which we have
already stepped. How do we know where we have already
stepped ? There is a sense which will tell us if
only we will give
it voice.
Nothing must be left outside but all held for the
time when, in this particular form of Yoga, you stand be-
fore the Point with the offerings of your fulfilled, completed
Majesty, becoming that which you worship.

And did not one fashion us in the Womb ? Job, XXXI, 5
The universe hath a Ruler [Rulers collectively] set over it,
which is called the Word (Logos) ; the fabricating Spirit is its
Queen : which two are the First Power after the One.1
It is of buddhic matter that is
spun the marvellous web of
life which supports and vivifies all our bodies. If the bodies be
looked at with buddhic vision, they all disappear, and in their
places is seen a shimmering golden web of inconceivable fineness
and beauty, a tracery of all their parts in a network with minute
meshes. A Study in Consciousness
We shall now see the second symbol of this form of
Yoga issuing from the first.

ness that was One becomes two. And the Radiance stirs.

The Point stirs into its twofold nature.

The North Pole of the Point is
negative stlence, and the South Pole is
positive silence, and when the signal comes. Father Silence and Mother
Silence give forth Sound. The interaction between the North and South
Poles of the Point is of the nature of web-spinning since the Line that is
formed first is a Web of Lines with greatest expansion at the middle point,
gradually curving towards their own respective poles.

Silence-Darkness and the still Radiance, becoming poised
between the Consummation and the Forthgoing.
We too stir. The inbreathing the poise the mighty
hush which precedes all
forthgoings belonged to the Point
as such. The Point stirs into a Web that is a Womb,
and yet remains a Point. The Positive of Silence-Darkness
fecundates the Negative of Silence-Darkness, as the nature
of each is stirred to a mode of differentiation within that
One which enfolds them both.
In the Point dwell the consummated forms, colours,
sounds of a Divine Perfection, and in these as the very
heart of each dwells the eternal archetype of its
being
which was in the No-Silence and in the No-Darkness, before
the Word, before the manifest. The Consummation itself
is but the projection of an infinite from the illimitable Be-
yond, a Son of Being, and a Father of Men-to-be, them-
selves all Sons of Being, yet needing the Fatherhood
of a God.
Vibrant with all these is the Web that is a Womb.
Cf their nature is it. Matrix is it of the Eternal Life.
And the Point remains the Silent Watcher l
behind the
Web that is a Womb. I believe it is
right but I am not
competent to affirm it that the World Mother in some way
represents the Cosmic Silent Watcher. Behind Her there
is an illimitable infinitude.
The embryo in any kingdom of nature corresponds to
the Web that is the Womb, for it is the immanence of
potentiality. But just as there is the Point as Silent Watcher
behind the Web that is the Womb, so is there a Silent
Watcher behind the embryo. And this Silent Watcher,
invisible to the outer eye, but visible to the inner, is the
eternal Ego, as the Monad or Man is the Silent Watcher
behind the Ego. There are wonderful fields of investigation
available in these dark regions of Light.

True it
may be that the Ego-link between Man, or
Monad, and the projection dipped down into matter appears
hardly, if at all, before the individualization into the human
kingdom. Yet the shadow is ever there, waiting its transition
into substance. And I believe that Monad-Men and Individual-
ity-Egos are watchful from the beginning to the very end.
From the Beginning to the End does the Web that is
the Womb remain, as does its
Progenitor, the Point. Silent
Watcher does it become of that to which it
gives birth.
Here are we face to face with primordial creation,
or rather with the cradle of creation as the Web-Womb
most surely is.
Once again must we enter deeply, most deeply, into
the spirit of this symbol, for inasmuch as we are the Point,
so are we a Web that is a Womb. The Cradle of Life is
within us. The Fatherhood and Motherhood of God are
within us. As Man we are created. As God we create.
As Father we lay a Divine Seed upon the Altar of God-
head. As Mother we lift
up that Seed that it
may unfold
to its Divinity.
Just as the Point is Self-conscious Divinity in its mode
of Undifferentiated Infinity, so is the Web that is the Womb
Self-conscious Divinity as it
begins the mighty journey of
its Forthgoing. The creative power of God, of Life, of
Nature, is
perceived in its apotheosis, so far as we are con-
cerned, in the cosmic act whereby the Point becomes self-
divided,
1
and in that self-division establishing a living matrix
for a differentiated Infinity-to-be, that is to say, for a mani-
fested evolution.
That Web that is the Womb of the new universe is
the setting for the Creative Activity of God, the Father-
.Mother aspect of being coming together.
I wonder if
you can conceive of yourselves, by a
supreme effort of a carefully directed imagination, as

you realize that every moment of your
progress and growth is
occupied in
functioning to this end.
I wonder if
you know that in you, as you are, are
all the experiences you have assimilated in every kingdom
of nature through which you have so far passed, that in
you are the Points of the kingdoms of the Elemental
Essences, fundamental Chakras or Centres of your Being,
that in you are the Points of the mineral, vegetable and
animal kingdoms, also Chakras or Centres of your Being.
We like to say that the kingdom of God is within
us, but we do not always remember that this kingdom of
God is
composed of all the kingdoms of nature that we
know and do not know, all the planes of consciousness that
we know and do not know, every experience from the
Beginning to the End.
I wonder if
you know that in you dwells no less every
experience through which you have yet to pass. You are
the super-man as you are also the sub-man and the man
you at present are. You are One, and you are a one. You
are also the many. For at every stage of the growth of
each one of us not only is there a mode of perfection
sounding forth its note of consummation, but the very
Consummation itself the Ultimate Point may itself be
heard in its perfect glory.
One of the great mysteries of evolution is that we
have to travel though we have arrived. If we are able
to unite the sense of arrival with the sense of travelling,
then indeed are we Yogis, knowing without experience, and
therefore experiencing for the sake of knowing.
In the far-off distance, when you have reached the
Godhead of your Manhood, these Points will glow and
become afire with the Divine Life that they are. They
will fuse into the Point at which we have been looking.
They will constitute the miracle-matrix which I am calling

"
because it is indeed a miracle which it
accomplishes, for it
constitutes the Sound, the Colour and the Form of Eternal
Divinity, and thus fashions the manifest-to-be in the living
image of its own essential Godhead.
" For God created man to be immortal, and made
him to be an image of His own eternity," chants the
Wisdom of Solomon (II, 23).
I do not think you can do better than to give attention
to the conception of Motherhood both in its macrocosmic
and microcosmic functionings perceiving the sublime
realities of Motherhood in every moment of growth.
Motherhood encompasses all life, even though in our
ignorance we so often flout it. We need to bring the
Mother-Spirit into intimate relationship with ourselves. If we
will meditate on God the Mother, and try to trace that
stupendous reality from its inaccessible heights into the
lesser yet still sublime heights, and into the hills and valleys
and plains of our living, into every kingdom of nature, we
shall glorify the Motherhood of God as we are accus-
tomed to reverence God's Fatherhood.

We are the Point. We are the Web that is the
Womb. We are Father. We are Mother. We are but
gazing upon our own resplendencies, upon that which is the
Self of each of us. Be we man or woman in any particular
incarnation, the real

We hear the Sound that is the herald of the Song of

to begin their entry into their heritage. It is an Oriflamme
behind which an evolution marches forward to its destiny,
as the Trumpet-Call mellows into that Song of the newly
awakened Life which every living thing sings as it wends its
way, sometimes to be heard by those who know how
to listen.
The nightingale of life's eternal meaning is ever sing-
ing in the hearts of men, as someone has so truly said.
That is literally true, because there are Devas and Gandharvas
the Angels attached to each one of these symbols and
manifestations of the Real. And singing the song of the
awakening life are the Devas and Gandharvas of the
Presence. (See
"
Devas and Gandharvas
"
in Book Five.)
At an end, the Song is
sung in all its perfect notes
of triumph by Him who enters His Godhead. The whole
of nature sings with Him, and the Devas and Gandharvas
of the Song blend their acclamation into His singing, and
echo it
through all the worlds of space, through all the
systems of the universes
At an end, the Oriflamme becomes His very garment,
shining as the rainbow shines, with glorious colours ranged
in the order of His unique Being, and the Devas of the
Light blend their shining- -how truly are they called Shin-
ing Ones with His Light, and send its
rays through all the
worlds of space, through all the systems of the universes.
All Life is One.
Forth flashes the Line in all its
Song-Light from the
Centre the Point to the North, from the Centre the
Point to the South, halted at either end, zenith and nadir,
by an Infinite Will which bids a Sea of the Unmanifest
awaken to its destiny of due appointing.
I
may quite appropriately describe this Line as a
Piston-Rod, for it seems to flash from North to South and
from South to North as the driving force of the machine of
the new evolutionary process.

Consider with me that the individual existence is a rope
which stretches from the infinite to the infinite, and has no end
and no commencement, neither is it
capable of being broken.
This rope is formed of innumerable fine threads . . . And re-
member that the threads are living --are like electric wires ; more,
are like quivering nerves . . . This illustration presents but a

Yet, dwell on it ;

into the measure of this Line, for it is so intimately con-

of the Forthgoing, as

round which the whole of the new universe will revolve.

It becomes a veritable faggot of Lines, possibly the ultimate
archetype of the Roman fasces.

I cannot effectively project myself into this strange

with divisions and subdivisions of the Monads lying asleep
in the Sea of the Unmanifest. Just as organs are devel-
oped in physical embryos, and racial and other character-

Why is the Line spiral ? I am afraid I do not yet know.
But I do know that nowhere are there straight lines. This
Line we are observing is a stupendous curve, and while it is
here limited as to its North and South, on the other hand it
is in some utterly incomprehensible way nothing more than a
section of a Line which stretches upwards into the infinities
and downwards. I see the Line as a curve, but I see it
limitless in its extent.
I am afraid lest I have misled you in giving the im-
pression that the Lines are what we call straight. In all my
experiences I have never seen a straight line, and to me
the two Lines and the very Cross itself are not straight but
curved. How can I describe a curved Cross ? How can I
describe a curved Line bisecting a Circle ?
In truth, these Lines with which we have been con-
cerned are projections of infinite curvatures of which I
can have no conception whatever. The Straightness is but
an appearance due to the weakness of our own percep-
tions, and to the fact that we are gazing upon a limitation.
The very Circle-Globe is but a projection of an infinite
Circle-Globe this itself being but a projection of infinitudes
beyond.
Gazing outwards to the Circumference the appearance
of Straightness descends upon us. Gazing inwards towards
the Centre there is an appearance of curves. Why? Be-
cause in the one case we are moving towards a limited Less,
while in the other case we are entering into a limitless More.

At our own particular level of evolution we must needs
see "straight
"
lest we should see crooked. But some day
we shall see "curved." As we all now know, the earth on
which we live is itself a curvature. Space-Time is a curvature.
We owe to Einstein the bringing down within the grasp
of science a fact generally known to students of Yoga alone.
My Teacher has tried to make me understand this
conception of the symbols of Yoga I should rather say this
fact of the symbols of Yoga. But it comes to me only now
since He did not think wise to introduce the fact before.
The Point is curved. The Lines are curved. The
Circle is curved, infinitely more curved than it
appears to
us. Symbolic Yoga is the Yoga of Essential Curvature.
And however strange this idea may seem, and strange
and incomprehensible it is, nevertheless it is
immensely
appropriate to Yoga, for Yoga is Action, and Action is
curvature.
1
Let rne quote to you from Sir Arthur Edding-
ton's Space, T/me and Gravitation. I must quote at length :
Action is ... mass multiplied by time, or energy multiplied
by time, and is more fundamental than either.
Action is the curvature of the world. It is
scarcely possi-
ble to visualize this statement, because our notion of curvature is
derived from surfaces of two dimensions in a three-dimensional
space, and this gives too limited an idea of the possibilities of a
four-dimensional surface in space of five or more dimensions In
two dimensions there is
just one total curvature, and if that vanishes,
the surface is flat or at least can be unrolled into a plane In four
dimensions there are many co-efficients of curvature ;
but there is
one curvature par excellence, which is, of course, an invariant
independent of our mesh-system. . . .
Wherever there is matter there is action and therefore
curvature. . . .
Sir Arthur Eddington suggests the possibility of the van-
ishing of curvature, but it would seem to me that there is no
more possibility of curvature vanishing than of light or sound.
Sir Arthur Eddington also states that he prefers
" to
think of matter and energy, not as agents causing the

degrees of curvature of the world, but as parts of our per-
ceptions of the existence of curvature."
So here we are with our smooth conceptions of truth
in symbols all upset because we have been taking for
granted that symbols can be drawn on pieces of paper.
This we could do and remain satisfied so long as there was
no urgent need for the symbols to come to life. We could
rest content with the static. But now our symbols rffust more
truly reflect that which they are supposed in some measure
to represent, for evolution is
beginning its action. We are
henceforth concerned with movement more akin to our
own understanding, and we are thus compelled to revise
that which so far has sufficed. It
may thus far have been
enough for us to be Newtons. We must now become
Einsteins, less by denying Newton and more by using him
as a stepping-stone to Einstein.
But we shall in due course see how difficult it is to set
our various symbols at work in the several states of our
consciousness, as is, of course, the purpose of this form
of Yoga.
The curved Point must be alive in every state of
our consciousness. It must be alive on our tension
or physical plane, on our movement or desire plane,
on our understanding or mind plane, on the plane of our
Law, on the plane of our Light, on the Plane of our Life or
Will insofar as we can contact these higher regions. So
must be the Web-Womb. So must be the first Line or
Divine Measure of the Future Event.
1
So must be the
Circle, the content of the Divine Measure. So must be the
second Line, the Line of manifestation. So must be the
Cross thus formed, the Divine Measure and the Divine
Action revolving within the Ring-Pass-Not content. And so,
as we shall see, must be other symbols no less.
1
Is it true that in the mind of the Logos the whole idea of the manifesta-
tion-to-be and the Sea of Green Men is as a Future Event -a kind of Point in
His consciousness awaiting His attention ?

The Point is masculine and feminine in one. So, there-

The Godhead is the sublimation of Man-Womanhood.

Each living thing, and all

It is, of course, not long before the masculine and feminine
elements are separated, for the purpose of more intensive
evolution. But even where there are men and women, in
whatever kingdom of nature, in each dwells the Man-
Woman, whatever be the prevailing emphasis. All unities,
all individualities, are twofold Man-Woman, and therefore,
Father-Mother. There is no masculinity anywhere which is
not equally a femininity. The man is man-woman. The
woman is woman-man. I think there has ever been a
realization of this, and quite recently Dr. Jung in an address

utilized' for purposes which can best be achieved through
the special form. At length the perfect inter-poise is
attained, and Man-Woman has become God.
This coalescence is foreshadowed in The Secret Doctrine
in the third volume (pp. 544-45 ;
Adyar ed., V, 517-18)
where it is written :
"
At the end of the next Round, Humanity
will again become male-female, and then there will be two
spinal cords. In the Seventh Race the two will merge into
the one." But the Godhead which I am conceiving is
by
no means reached even in the Seventh Race.
If
you wish, you may remove from your conception of
these Ultimates all idea of sex, and from one point of view
you will be right. On the other hand, you cannot remove
the conception of a Creative Spirit the primordial Pro-
genitor of what we call sex, and within this Spirit lie the
seeds of male and female.
Our entire conception of sex has become limited by
its
expression in these outermost regions of matter and
consciousness, where all inner realities become materialized
and comparatively lifeless.
Let us be clear that the whole evolutionary process
involves extension after extension into less and less truly
dense Life, until in these outermost regions there is so
little life that it becomes exceedingly difficult to breathe.
It is as if we went up into great heights in the atmosphere
without more than the minimum amount of oxygen neces-
sary to breathe. We should indeed gasp for breath. On
the physical plane we are in truth gasping for life.
We have to learn to gasp for life as the hart panteth
after the water-brooks, for only by being bereft of life shall
we be able to appreciate it at its true value. We leave
home and move away into the farthest regions where,
amidst a sense of homelessness, but with the faintest of re-
membrances of home, we learn how to make our home
even in such desolate wastes, thus learning to perceive

everywhere the home which, in fact,, we have never left,
but which is round about us even in these seemingly home-
less places.
Here we are in the illusion of being in the midst
of life. Such is the great illusion, the great Maya. Here
we feel we live, and we are even afraid, so insinuating is
the illusion, of leaving these comparative illusions of the
senses when in fact our dying is in truth into more
living. We cling to life, not really because there is so
much of it, but because there is so little of it. There
is in fact so little that we fear death will take away from us
even that little. So we make the most, sometimes the best
and sometimes the worst, of the life-illusion in the midst
of which we dwell, and let go of it with fear and doubt.
Everything assumes, therefore, an entirely dispropor-
tionate stature, for the simple reason that we have no
memory of all the far greater things on the other side of
sleep and death.
Our very physical bodies become of paramount im-
portance, and at all costs we seek to preserve them. We
are afraid of our feelings and emotions, for we seem in
them to dwell in a region of great impermanence. They
are here today and are gone tomorrow. We cherish
ardently our minds, for they seem as solid and matter-of-
fact as our physical bodies, though of another mode of
consciousness. Our minds and our bodies are everything
to us, and we seek to base our living upon them.
The result is that we crave without finding means to
satisfy our cravings. Instead of lifting up our eyes unto the
hills whence cometh the help of our higher consciousness,
we turn to the mind, and try to assuage our thirst with
pride. We turn to the feelings and the emotions, and try
to assuage our thirst with sensations which must ever be-
come more and more gross so as to stimulate our in-
creasingly jaded palates.

Thus is it that the whole conception of sex, infinitely
marvellous as it is and gloriously beautiful, has in us become
small, selfish, uncontrolled, and imprisoned within the
narrow confines of the physical plane itself. True indeed, the
physical sexual act itself is the faint yet wonderful reflection
of the Creative Activity of God. It is a marvellous sacra-
ment reflecting its brother-sacraments which ascend right
up to the very Throne of God Himself. But how is it
used by most ?
It is a terrible insult to the whole spirit of sex of the
Two becoming One in order that the One may become
Two. On every plane of consciousness sex is at work. The
One Silence becomes two Silences, and this symbol-truth
of Yoga involves the very loftiest conceptions of cosmic
sex. And then the Sound becomes two and many, so that
the notes of a scale are the children of the union of the two
aspects of Sound. So is it with the colours of the rainbow
which are the children of the Light in its dual aspect.
I am well aware that we read in many books of that
which is sexless or a-sexual. In The Secret Doctrine there
is much on this theme. Yet, so far as I have tried to
understand, while there may be a One without a Second,
still there is
implicit in the most abstract idea of an Absolute
we are using words we cannot possibly understand all
that comes forth from the Absolute. Of course, there is
no sex such as we know in these lower regions, but there
is ever the immanence of creative power.
I wonder if I shall be misunderstood if I
say that each
one of us alone and by himself is a creator, even though
for a special creative act the man-motif must unite with the
woman-motif so far as regards the physical plane.
I see so clearly that we need to lay the greatest stress
on the fact that in many ways a creative act increases in
wonder and glory as it becomes more and more self-
contained and Self-contained.

Let me repeat that physical union, if
permeated by
and surrounded with the power and consecration of its
mighty prototypes, if a sacrament and an act of reverence
in that the glory of God so beautifully shines even in these
mayavic regions, is not only an ecstasy of a very high type,
but is a living and compelling witness to the fact that we are
indeed Gods, and here and now may perform Godly acts.
Sex, as we know it out here, is
truly our salvation if
only we
could realize the fact.
Alas ! too often we make it our damnation, more
especially when clouded and darkened to desolation by
passion and lust. Marriage today is
hardly ever a sacrament,
but too often a fleeting convenience, and one of the greatest
tragedies of modern life is that what should be an enduring
sacrament is turned into that most terrible circumstance
the caricature of a sacrament, when dedicated forms are

deliberately refused the life which is the only title to their
existence. How inconceivably horrible it is that any of the
great sacraments connected with these outer regions can be
desecrated as is the sacrament of marriage in its fulfilment.
We hear of the Black Mass. There is also the Black
Marriage. Every symbol-truth of Symbolic Yoga is an
assertion of the sanctity of sacrament, and of the right
of every seed to grow into the beauty of its destined
flower.
Let us beware of creating prisons when it is our nature
to create gardens. Let us beware of being destroyers
when in very truth we are creators. Let us beware of
giving forth discord when the whole of Life is dedicated
to Song.
We are creators. From the beginning creation is the
blood of. life. Wrapt in the One Silence are Father and
Mother Silence, and when the great Call goes forth that
the One shall create, there begins an evolutionary process
of the grandeur of which not even the greatest among us
has more than a faint conception.
Out pours the creative spirit on to plane after plane
of widening circumference, till we reach the confines of the
planes of which we have some little information. On the
plane of Atma, Will, is stored the great reservoir of creative
power for all the planes below, save insofar as every plane
has in fact a direct access to the ultimate fountain of
power.

of creating, and let us contrast these with all that leads up
to, or does not lead up to, marriage, and of all that follows
after marriage.
How right the Roman Catholic Church is in her instinct-
ive recoil from contraceptives as a blasphemy against the
sacrament of marriage, but for the fact that woman in these
days of the Kali Yuga needs protection against man. I fear
we have to run the risk of the use of contraceptives for
the evasion of sacred responsibilities in order that these
witnesses to our present degradation may be available to
guard against man's lawlessness until he learns reverence.
To such ignoble expedients are we reduced !
How far is
physical creation in these days from God-
liness. Everything contributes to Godlessness -
books, the
press, the theatre, music, most forms of kiisure, dead-ness
in religion, and narrowness in the arts, sciences and phil-
osophies, and the whole setting of economic, industrial and
political life. As the world is, the marvel of sex has been
degraded to a means of escape from what is so terribly
unreal. And the result is a world at war with itself. We
are Godless when we should be Godmore.
The would-be Yogi must free himself from all this
unreality and sordidness. Physical sexual activity may be
his insofar as it is a sacrament and not a lust. But unless
it is
positively a sacrament, Yoga will be for him disastrous
There is for the Yogi but one universal creative activity on
whatever plane. If
anywhere selfishness enters into it, on
any plane, Yoga ceases to function in fact. Nor can the
candle of creative activity be burned at both ends. The
Yogi is in major measure intent on the higher creative
activities creative activity on the emotional plane, on the
mental plane and beyond. For him creative activity on
192 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
the physical plane, apart from reproducing in physical plane
matter the creations of his feelings, emotions, mind and
higher consciousness, must be reduced to a minimum, if he
should have any such activity at all.

To sum up, let me now state again that this Line is

of the Life-to-be. It is the Plumb-Line of the evolu-
tionary process, to which the whole process conforms.
It is the Standard for both the highest and lowest reaches
of the manifested Life, and within it are the lesser standards
for the innumerable phases of growth.
Within this all-embracing Line are the Standards for
the various divisions of the evolutionary process for the
ten Schemes of our Solar System, for example, for the
Chains of each Scheme, for the Rounds and Globes of
each Chain, and for every subdivision of these.

The Circle is measured by the Line which is the off-
spring of the Point in its Web-scintillation. And it is the
Line which Madame Blavatsky calls the "
Divine Measure,
the Yard-Measure."
The Line conjures the finite from the Infinite, and the
Circle Globe as it is in reality determines the limita-
tions of the finite.
It is
very wonderful, when you think of forms, to find
that Science seems now to be reflecting that curvature
'
principle which is
everywhere. There are no straight lines.
You will not find any straight-line triangles. I do not know
what a triangle is, unless you will allow me a curved triangle.
A curved square is of course quite conceivable. Straight or
Euclidean geometry is now passing into the geometry of
curvature. A circle down here seems to be self-contained.
I have never found a circle that is self-contained. There
is no question of a finite universe in these regions, for
everything is
expanding, and it is an expanding Circle that
one has to try to understand. One must think of a Globe
gradually becoming larger and larger. The spiral is a form
of the Circle.
This Circle fulfils two distinct functions. It marks the
frontiers of the new evolutionary process, and simultane-
ously draws round the Point, the Web that is a Womb,
and the Line, a sea of undifferentiated matter which stirs
into differentiation at the very moment of its
enclosing.
Thus do the Compasses of God, with one point at the
Centre-Point and the other at an extremity of the Line,
draw a Circle-Circumference both to describe a limitation
and to fill it with a Sea of undifferentiated Life a Sea

terms of Sound, of Form, and of Light, of a God without.
At once, as I see a universe flash into my conscious-
ness, I am conscious of almost blinding Light, of deafening
Sound, of overwhelming Form. The Point vibrates into the
Web that is the Womb. The Web vibrates into the Line.
The Line thrills into the Circle, and flashes forth a Sound
and a Colour and a Form which are to be the basic vibra-
tions of the differentiation. A Sea which responds in its
own being to this Sound and Colour and Form pours into
the Globe the Globe which includes a multitude of globes.
Of what is this Sea composed ? Of Men, of Monads,
in each of whom vibrates the Sound, the Colour and the
Form of the awakening.
There is a selectivity which determines the Sea. But
of its nature J find myself still
entirely ignorant.

The
undifferentiated matter pours into the Circle which responds
to the rhythmic beat of the God who is
calling it to awaken.
The whole of this evolution belongs to the fundamental Arche-
type of the Point, that which distinguishes this Point from all
other Points, however much must be identical the primordial
natures of all Points.
To bring all this down into very physical terms, if this
Point be blue, it must needs attract a sea of blue Men, and
their Godhead must needs be blue, even though all colours
are theirs.
And if
you ask me where is THAT which is the very
whole of all the scales of Light, the very whole of all the
scales of Sound, I can only take refuge, as even the
Greatest have taken refuge, in the use of a word which
lifts us out even from symbols, for no symbols are available,
and say that the word THAT itself is all we can postulate.
THAT is a very good word because it means NO-

I cannot tell you the extraordinary bliss of experiencing
the consciousness, with a certain measure of development
in the meditation, of that primordial beginning. In that
Universal Yoga in the lower kingdoms of nature, there is
nothing more wonderful than to feel that each single
creature is
performing his Yoga within the caress, the
blessing, the unfoldment of the Universal Yoga which is
God. It induces a new reverence for life.
THE FLOWER-PETAL COSMIC SEA l
Each Petal itself
Suppose you try to project yourself into the beginnings,
a [Lotus] Flower t ne first impression is this sea of cosmic dust . . An expanse
of cosmic unconsciousness is another way of saying the same thing,
and in that expanse of cosmic unconsciousness, you perceive the
semblance of a flower of which each speck of dust is a petal . . .
The sea has the whole appearance of a sea because it breathes ;
it is
rhythmic in its
expression It is, as you look at it, a flower and
the flower has an infinitude of petals, so when you project yourself
into the beginning, there is this vast flower-sea, and each constituent
element is a petal and also, of course, a flower itself.
Into that sea comes a God ... His major constituent
elements are twofold Movement and Light ... A God awake
knocks upon the consciousness of an infinitude of Gods asleep, as the
God who was awake a myriad light-years ago, aeons ago, knocked
upon the doors ... of our own Godfulness . . . We use the spark
idea for the beginning, the flame idea for a particular process of
unfoldment and the fire idea for the fulfilment.
That unfoldment which takes place as God awakens our
Divinity within us is ... partly expansion, the normal mode, and
partly explosion . . . The Path of Holiness is the explosion
type of growth because of the suddenness of the expansions of
consciousness.

THE SEA OF MEN IN THE CIRCLE
A New
Symphony of
Evolution
Jacob's Ladder
The Ultimate
Creative Word
We have found a strange footprint on the shores of the
unknown. We have devised profound theories to account for its
origin. At last we have succeeded in reconstructing the creature
that made the footprint. And lo '
it is our own. Eddington
Every diamond, every crystal, every plant and star has its
own individual soul, besides man and animal . . . There is a
hierarchy of souls from the lowest forms of matter up to the
World Soul G. H. Fechner
The raga of a new Life sounds forth. The motif of
a new symphony of evolution vibrates through cosmos,
through the cosmic sea.
. . . The earth was without form, and void ;
and dark-
ness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God
moved upon the face of the waters.
Thus is said in that wonderful Book of Genesis, which
so truly depicts the Yoga of a Forthgoing, the Yoga of a
a Godhead sending forth the Men of the Sea on their
appointed way, to climb rung-kingdom after rung-kingdom
of the Ladder which stretches from the dust of the un-
conscious up to the diamond of the Self-conscious. And
as I see the picture of this climbing, I am reminded of
Jacob's Dream l
which so extraordinarily sets forth in detail
the beginning, way, and end of an evolutionary process.
The Word of the Line is
spoken, and the Words of
myriad upon myriad of Monads echo in response. I use

to know them in the kingdoms beyond us, Men as we have
still to recognize them in every sub-human kingdom about
us. Around me are myriad forms beginning to lisp their
Words. 1
Around me in all the worlds are a myriad Men
learning through sounds and forms and colours to speak
Life's language, and to know the very heart of language in
its ultimate creative Word.
In the mineral kingdom are Men. In the vegetable
kingdom are Men. In the animal kingdom are Men. We
of the human kingdom are Men. And upwards stretches
the Ladder of Manhood until it reaches Godhead.
There are the Men who are not yet men as we
watch them growing within the Universal Yoga provided for
their earlier wanderings.
There are the Men who are men as we watch them
infinitely slowly attaining their individualized Yogas from out
the Universal Yoga.
There are the Men who are Gods- as we watch from
afar the splendid denizens of the " Men beyond mankind/'
to use the expressive phrase of Mr. Fritz Kunz. There is
the Man who is Godhead as we glimpse through these
symbols.
To me it is more than marvellous that as I look out
from the windows of my consciousness, I see around me
my own projected Word, and the Word of every other
thing that lives and moves and has its
being in this cosmos
of the manifest. Here am I. Around me in myriad forms,
at myriad stages of evolution, are " Men

It is so true that Man precedes all other growth that
one sometimes wonders how there can be any doubt in the
matter. The Secret Doctrine, of course, emphasizes the
fact in several passages, as for example in the "
Preliminary
Notes
"
to the Stanzas of Dzyan.
1
Man precedes all other
forms because he is the evolutionary process so far as his
order is concerned, though there are other orders with
central motifs other than the Man-motif, as, for example,
the whole of the Deva or Angel evolution.
Each kingdom of nature is
part and parcel of Man's
evolution, and as we gaze upon these kingdoms and their
inhabitants, we are gazing upon Men evolving through
varying forms of externalization. There is no ultimate dis-
tinction between Men in the human kingdom and Men in
the kingdoms beneath Man, though it is true that in each
kingdom there are individualities belonging to different
orders of evolution.
And I become impressed by the fact that as I look
out upon the world I see a Man-family rather than a human
family a Man-family extraordinarily interdependent. Each
member depends upon every other member for his grow-
ing, and man-Man needs God-Man, animal-Man, vegetable-
Man, mineral-Man and elemental-essence-Man for his
growing, and no less vice versa.
This means that Right Relationship so well expressed
by the Samskrit word Dharma needs to pervade the
whole of the life of the family, and the fact that it does
not is the cause of every problem, every misery, that

besets the living world. The great Law of Adjustment is

peace, prosperity and happiness return.
Let me say that this form of Yoga is
very specially
designed to enable its votaries to perceive with awakened
consciousness that Universal Brotherhood is real and im-
manent. If the student of this form of Yoga is
beginning
to perceive that every living thing in every kingdom of
nature is his own blood-brother, if he reaches this stage
with Yoga-clarified eyes, then has he begun to know this
Yoga, for he will reverence and cherish accordingly. Said
one of the greatest of all Elder Brothers : "You be all of
one blood, one source, one goal. Know this truth and live
it."
1
And He mentioned various kingdoms of life from
the Elder Brothers Themselves, the Supermen, through men
righteous and erring, to the younger brothers animals,
flowers and trees. The magnificent code of living He set
forth in such words as these :
" Great elder brothers shall
you be, if
you will, protecting all
younger than yourselves
blessing them with your tender, wise and strong compassion,
giving ever more as those to whom your compassion is due
are more and more behind you on the pathway of Life."
When the Christ said :
" Ye are Gods,"
J
He was
addressing the whole of Life in every realm of its expres-
sion. No less is this form of Yoga designed to enable its
votaries to perceive in some measure the universal per-
meation through the differentiation of every single atom,
or rather Monad, of it.

LIFE ETERNAL SELF-FULFILLED
Cultivate imagination to the point of vision. Blake
The great and
mighty Hush
Constructive
Negation
As I examine this particular symbol of Yoga the
Circle-Globe I find myself becoming immersed in a con-
dition of consciousness which curiously reflects that great
and mighty hush separating the Consummation from the
Forthgoing in the symbol of the Point. There seems to be
a hush connected with every symbol at a certain stage of
its manifestation, or in relation to a preceding or succeeding
symbol. And when we come to the Circle-Globe this hush
is
very marked until the Svastika begins to circle on its
appointed way. The appearance of the horizontal Line is
as an electric flash, to be immediately followed by a
renewal of the hush which preceded its
appearance.
I
note, in connection with each hush, that the sense
of Time entirely disappears, as does also the sense of Space,
and of Spirit and Matter. Each hush is an intriguing ex-
pression of a most potent and constructive negation, for be
it remembered that there is no less positiveness in negation
than in affirmation, no less affirmation in negation than in
what we call affirmation. A hush such as I am able to
perceive becomes a kind of indispensable setting or back-
ground for the Movement to follow. There can be no
Movement without its
background or setting of No-Move-
ment with all its
fascinating hush-ness, with its No-Move-
ment antithesis. I often feel myself constrained to think of
LIFE ETERNAL SELF-FULFILLED 203

All
this hush-motif as an ever-present memory of Silence, of
Darkness, of Formlessness, so that these are ever with us,
ever penetrate the most microscopic process of evolution.
The hush is the memory of the primordial, of that which is
progenital, of the very creative spirit itself. The hush is the
memory of Father-Mother, the intimation of the immanence
of Father-Mother, almost an incarnation of the Silent
Watcher, a No-Symbol of the Ultimate Presence.
A No-Symbol ? Yes ; I attach as much importance in
these inner regions of consciousness to the No-Symbol
Ultimate as to the Symbol-Ultimates which form the theme
of this book. I wish that some day I could write on The
Yoga of No-Symbol. While I am penetrated by these
inner regions I think I could. But as I return to earth I
become paralyzed with an absence of that No-Language
whereby alone I could describe the No-Symbol of that
which transcends the very formless itself.
The moment I enter the regions- -if at all ! have any
right to call them regions, but what can I do otherwise of
consciousness which is Hush I find that only as I affirm that
Life comes from nowhere, is nowhere, goes nowhere, is a
Naught, can I dare rightly to assert that Life is, has its
supreme origin, its compelling destiny, is an All. I must
swing my pendulum of perception between an affirmation
and a negation with regard to very Life itself about the
existence of which we have no other recourse in these
outer regions than to say that it is axiomatic. But in
certain states of consciousness only a swinging between
pairs of opposites can give even a modicum of understand-
ing. Between a Yes and a No I must hover poised, and
in the poise, lies Truth.
Chapter 1 8
THE TRIANGULARITIES1
Every manifested God is spoken of as a Trinity. The
joining of these three Aspects, or phases of manifestation, at their
outer points of contact with the Circle, gives the basic Triangle of
contact with Matter, which, with the three Triangles made with the
Lines traced by the Point, thus yields the Divine Tetractys, some-
times called the Kosmic Quaternary, the three divine Aspects in
contact with Matter, ready to create. These, in their totality, are
the Oversoul of the kosmos that is to be/ Annie Besant
Now as the Ring-Pass-Not flashes forth, it is to be
perceived that the Men of which the Sea is composed are
characterized in particular by what I must call triangularity.
There are | find myself hesitating as I
suggest that Man, and
other Series of
Symbols therefore God, must be regarded as a triangularity, as
threefold in nature. The moment I think of one particular
*
figure I think of another figure. I
perceive no figure
either markedly or, still less, exclusively characteristic of
Man and God. True, I have singled out a series of sym-
bols for your examination, for they constitute a definite
Ladder down and up which Men and Gods move.
3
But
there are doubtless many other series ; and we must be
careful, I
think, not to allow ourselves to become imprisoned
within the limitations of any particular figure, or series of
figures.

that state it must have form for representations. The Secret Doctrine, III, 542

In his aspect of God, man incarnates the Trinity of
Being. He is Ananda, as the Samskrit word is, the very
Will of the All-One, formless, yet perfectly poised between
Being and Non-Being. He is the Silence and the Darkness,
the Point in this form of Symbolic Yoga.
He is Chit, the Will of the All-One in Form. He is
Forthgoing, Wisdom, as He is sometimes called, Progenitor
of knowledge. He is the Web that is the Womb in this
form of Symbolic Yoga.
He is Sat, the Creative Spirit, the Will of the All-One
in Movement. He is Truth, which is the projection of
Being. He is the Line in this form of Symbolic Yoga.
In His aspect of man, God, with these three great
rhythms, veils the excess of their Glory in the well-known
attributes which reflect the Divine Trinity :
He is lamas, the reflection of Ananda, the unruffled,
perfectly reflecting, immobile sea of consciousness, resist-
ant, and seemingly unchanging.
He reflects the Will of the All-One by resisting it.
Tamas is Tension.
He is Sattva, the reflection of Chit, the sea of con-

Forms of the All-One, moved by purpose and design.
He reflects the Wisdom of the All-One by reproduc-
ing it. Sattva is Tone.
He is
Rajas, the reflection of Sat, the sea of con -
sciousness wave-tossed, swaying, disturbed, perhaps tur-
bulent, but sending its life-waves down into its

He reflects the Truth of the All-One by seeking it.

THE 47TH PROPOSITION OF EUCLID
To Pythagoras is attributed the discovery of the 47th Prop-
osition of Euclid, which now forms the jewel of the I P M in
English Masonry, and is the basis not only of a great portion of
exoteric geometry but, in a mystical sense, of the whole system
of the Mysteries, and indeed of the universe itself.

is manifold, and while one naturally inclines to

be nearer to the truth were I to conceive of each triangu-
larity as of the nature of the triangle described in the
great 47th Proposition, so-called of Euclid, but really of
Pythagoras, wherein it is stated that the square described
on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is
equal to the
sum of the squares described on the other two sides.
What in fact is the square on the hypotenuse, which
is to say, what is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle ?

essential, and the angle is the immediate esssential, of the
triangle. I am, therefore, inclined to believe that while

Achieved
Equilibrium
the equilateral triangle represents the Trinity conception
of Life, in all the perfect equilibrium which the Trinity rep-
resents, the right-angled triangle takes us a step further
into manifestation, giving us the vertical Line of the Divine
Measure, the horizontal Line which represents the Descent
into the matter-motif, the passing from divine conscious-
ness into man-consciousness, and in the hypotenuse, the
Line of the First Logos vivifying at a particular point the
ascending individuality.
I then assume that the vertical Line represents the
Third Logos, while the horizontal Line represents the Second
Logos, the former the life-force, the latter the form-force.
In terms of this interpretation, what then do we mean
when we say that the square of the hypotenuse is
equal to
the sum of the squares on the other two sides ?
I think we mean that the force of the First Logos
(Third Life Wave) is, at the moment of its contact with the
ascending unfoldment, in perfect proportion to the com-
bined force of the Line of Vivification (the Third Logos) and
the Line of Manifestation (the Second Logos), in other
words, to the combined force of the First and Second Life
Waves. I see in this a very profound truth expressed as
an aspect of the Law of Adjustment. There is a very per-
fect adjustment between the life-power of the ascending
individuality and the life-power of the descending First
Logos, so that out of the right-angled triangle emerges the
equilateral triangle of achieved equilibrium.

Ancient Persian Inscription
The square [a right-angled jewel in Masonry] indicates the

Person of the Trinity.'
-~C.W.L.
Intimately connected with this right-angled symbol of
manifesting Life and its contingent squares is the represent-
ation of this symbol in terms of globes or circles rather
than of squares. In other words, the Square of the Circle
which we call the Hypotenuse is the sum of the Squares of
the Circles on the other two sides. It is
literally true. I
have seen it.'
2
Most interestingly, it would seem that the whole
problem of squaring the Circle depends, for at least one of
its solutions, upon the basis of a right-angled triangle, with
the Square idea as its heart. This solution is due to Archi-
medes, the Egyptians achieving the same result by a still
more complicated mathematical process.
Indeed is it true that, from the standpoint of this form
of Yoga, Square and Circle are identical. Essentially one,
since they are potentially interchangeable forms, neverthe-
less the Square is a projection from the Circle, the Circle
in a state of manifestation, so that the figure of a Square

in its
aspect
of a right-angled four-sided figure. This is an extension of
the pure right-angle which from time immemorial has been
regarded as the symbol of Law, Righteousness, Justice.
And when its point becomes the centre of a Circle
and the meeting-point of the two great Lines, then it takes
on the mighty characteristic of a sacred spot, combining
with its extension into rectangularity within the Ring-Pass-
Not of the Circle to form a Centre and a Square from
which no instructed Yogi can err.
May I
just suggest that the very Circie uself has, in a
dimension beyond those of which we have some cog-
nizance, its own triangularity with its central point as one
"side," its radius as a second "side," and its circum-
ference as a third
" side
"
? There is
very much more in
this than at first meets the eye, but I fear it will not be
profitable to pursue further what is a most fascinating path-
way of research.
While I do not for a moment say it is
right nothing
is
right still at the same time it is an exercise which
stretches the consciousness, and it does not do any harm
provided it is found interesting, and provided it seems
to lead more deeply into the real.
The fact of the matter is that the more one becomes
impregnated with the spirit and even the forms of the
symbols the more one tends to perceive them everywhere.
It becomes impossible to look at anything without seeing a
symbol, indeed all the symbols, in it. Furthermore, one
cannot look at anything without perceiving that one is look-
ing at an individuality a Man, may I
say ? I am afraid lest
this seem so extravagant as to cause a sense of repulsion ;
and yet perhaps there is more truth in it than at first meets
the eye. I must certainly say that I see in every geometrical
210 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
figure a symbol of Man, of Man within a Law, of Man in
terms of his evolutionary progress.
Geometry a | a m the symbols, each symbol, and they are " I."
Science of Life
If we could have a perfect set of symbols setting forth in
detail the stages of the evolutionary process, symbolizing
each stage, that is, we should have a symbolic picture of
the growth of Man from his unconsciousness to his unfolded
consciousness. And I am sure that whether we think in
terms of Euclidean or of non-Euclidean geometry we are
thinking in terms of symbols which depict Will, and Light,
and Law, which is to say, Life. And it would indeed be
well if some day a genius were to arise able positively to
relate every Euclidean or non-Euclidean figure to an aspect
of Man's unfolding life. Geometry must become a science
of life, of everyday life, as much as domestic science.
And so must every science and every art. Reality is
lacking
in many of the arts and sciences, and therefore in the
college and school curricula. Were these curricula related
to life they would cause colleges and schools to be great
centres of inspiration instead of being, as many of them still
are, and as the curriculum for the most part is, a reflection*

implying the mani-

Asleep within each Man undifferentiated, that
dwell the three great Logoi, or Life-Streams of the One
God, and their counterparts in the gunas, or essential quali-
ties, with which the student of Hinduism is so familiar. These
are asleep in these Men without minds, though divine in
their consciousness.
So the Logoi who are God call to the Logoi who are
Men. The Logos Self-conscious as Three calls to the Logos
unconscious as Three. And at this point I think I should
try to explain what I mean by these Logoi and how They
seem to function.
I would again refer you to Dr. Besant's great work
entitled A Study in Consciousness, and to Bishop Lead-
beater's Man Visible and Invisible, and also his Christian
Creed for a wealth of detail regarding these mighty Forces.
There are three aspects of the Eternal Life the first
is the Life that creates ; the second is the Life that builds ;
l
the third is the Life that vitalizes. All three are in the One
Life, and all three are One.

The Coming
forth in Time
Yet, when we look from below upwards, we see that
each component part or organism or Monad or Man in a
Sea of Undifferentiation receives its first impetus from the
vitalizing third aspect of the Eternal Life, so that the nature
of each is
projected outwards instead of remaining inturned.
Indeed, the Third Logos without sucks out the Third Logos
within if I
may be pardoned the expression. It would
almost seem as if the projection of the Third Logos
causes a relative vacuum round about each Monad or Man,
causing the Life within the Monad to leap out in response.
This activity is
represented by the symbol of the Line.
Then, the Monad being awake as to its nature, the
second impetus goes forth from the form-building second
aspect of the Eternal Life, and the awakened nature
streams forth into innumerable forms, each series with its
archetypal counterparts in the great Progenitor, the Point.
This activity is represented by the symbol of the Web
that is the Womb.
Then, at a certain stage of the evolutionary process,
forms and nature reach that stage of refining at which the
higher forces of Life may be begun to be sent forth in
ever-increasing intensity. At this point, the third impetus
goes forth from the creative first aspect of the Eternal
Life in its aspect of Divine Individuality, universal though it
has always been in its aspect of Divine Universality. This
activity is represented by the symbol of the Point.
So does the Logos which is One and Three pervade
a Sea of the Unmanifest. Essentially, there is no time
division of Its aspects. The Third aspect does not come
first in relation to the Sea of the Unmanifest, nor the
Second aspect second, nor the First aspect third. Yet it
is true to say that the influence of the Line, the Third
Logos, is the first actively to pervade the Sea of the
Unmanifest ; while the influence of the Web that is the
Womb, the Second Logos, the form matrix, is the second

actively to pervade the sea of the now manifest ; and
while the influence of the Point, the First Logos, all-con-
taining,^ takes upon Itself the form of Divine Individuality
and awaits the ascent of Man until he knows himself, then
touching, with Its own Divinity, the individuality which at
last Man has begun to achieve and therefore to know.
The First Aspect, or Logos, is the Voice of the very
Essence of Life itself, marking the beginning of the assump-
tion by Man of the Crown of his Divinity. As Man begins
to know the nature of his own individual Essence of Life, so
does the First Aspect pour down upon him Its Divine Illum-
ination whereby he shall ascend into that Self-conscious
Individuality-Universality in which he assumes his Godhead.
The Second Aspect, or Logos, is the Voice of the
Form of Life, of the Matrix or Divine Cradle of Life, fashion-
ing the forms wherein Man shall climb upwards to his
destiny, to crown himself God.
The Third Aspect, or Logos, is the Voice of the Life
of Man, awakening him to Self-consciousness, and sending
him forth on his way through the Cradle to the Crown.
So may we say that the First Logos waits, the Second
Logos fashions, and the Third Logos awakens.
May we regard the First Logos as the universal
Substans ever universal, but at a divine moment individu-
al the Second Logos as the universal Form, the Third Logos
as the universal Life ? Yet how can I
suggest differences of
function and appearance, when there is neither difference
of function nor of appearance from the standpoint of the
Above? Only because we look do we perceive these illusions.
THE THREE LIFE-STREAMS
One must distinguish between the changes of Consciousness
through which the First Logos, the One without a Second, becomes
the dual Second Logos, from which emerges the Creative Activity,
or Third Logos, and the changes in Form whereby these Three
Logoi, manifesting in reverse order, create, preserve and re-
generate a universe in the Three Great Life-Waves.
214 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
The first three symbols of this form of Yoga Point, Web,
Line obviously refer to Logoic unfoldment. After the formation
of the Circle, balance between Life and Form, we find in reverse
order the unfoldment of Form, ;.e., horizontal Line which makes
the Cross, then the Svastika, followed* by the perfected form
the Lotus. Both perpendicular Line and equal-armed Cross are
symbols of the Third Logos. Is the Cross the fulfilment of the
Line ? Is the Svastika the fulfilment of the Web ? Is the Lotus the
fulfilment of the Point ? Compare A Study in Consciousness, The

It is
important to emphasize, in connection with the
functioning of the Ring-Pass-Not, the fact that not only
does it, through the Line, establish the nature and limitation
of the evolutionary architecture in the matter of its ascent
into the heights, but it also determines the limits of descent.
I am not prepared to say that such limitations are rigid. I
believe that the limitations of height may be transcended,
and I think we have evidence that there has already been a
penetration below those depths which were originally
designed to be ultimate frontiers on the pathway of Forth-
going. But in general the Ring-Pass-Not fulfils the two-
fold function of defining the extent both of evolutionary
heights and evolutionary depths.
Furthermore, it seems to me that the Ring-Pass-Not
also acts in some mysterious way to maintain a kind of
interplay with the Centre, so that there is ever a throwing
forth of Light and Sound and Form in terms of Colours
1
and
Notes and Shapes from the Centre to the Circumference and
from the Circumference back to the Centre. This flashing
interplay is
part of the evolutionary process, and directly and
ceaselessly acts upon the evolving individualities.

A gorgeous
Scintillation of
Colour
Giver of Life to
your World
The Line-Streak
of Divine Fire
And as an interpenetrating background we notice the
Blue of the vertical Line, the Green of the Sea, and the
Crimson of the horizontal Line, so that, looked upon from
outside, the scintillation is
supremely gorgeous, especially
if we add to all this the majestic cascades of music which
thrill the whole atmosphere and make it vocal, not only
with its own inherent music, but with the rhythmic chantings
of the Devas of Sound, who sing with notes we know not
of. So, too, do the Devas of Colour flood the atmosphere
with throbbing waves of all the colours we know, and of
innumerable other colours we do not yet know. And so
do the Devas of Form play Form-melodies and symphonies
on those wondrous Form-instruments which entirely elude
my understanding.
As Dr. Besant writes in her Evolution of Life and Form :
Colours and notes alike result from vibrations, and are
determined by the number of vibrations occurring in a unit of time.
As the universe is built by vibrations, colour and sound are factors
of the universe at large, and every region is said to have its own
colour ; the God of that region has his colour dependent on his
vibratory force which he imprints on the region over which he
rules ; so that, if a Rishi looks at the solar system from a higher
plane, he not only hears the seven fundamental notes of music,
making
"
the harmony of the spheres," but he sees a gorgeous
display of colours, as the sphere of every great Deva, with his own
colour, interpenetrates the others, yielding an iridescent splendour
of interfering radiances, the marvellous
"
rainbow that is round the
throne of God."
I am hoping that these two symbols of the Line and
the Circle will remind you of your own power to be a giver
of life to a world, your own individual world, and, as you
grow in spiritual stature, to the whole world, and in later
ages, as in the case of the Lord Buddha, for example, to a
whole universe of worlds and more.
Think of the Line the streak, I
might almost call it
of Divine Fire, round which as in a flash gathers the Circle,
in its turn to be filled as in a moment by the Sea waiting the
Word which Line and Circle speak together.
THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CIRCLE 217
Stand erect as
the Line of
Power
Flash forth the
Line
Encircle your
World
You are a Line of Divine Fire or Light. In you the
Life of the third aspect of the Logos pulsates with un-
imaginable power. Stand erect as the Line. Flash forth
your life into your surroundings, into persons, into principles,
into communities, into nations, into faiths, into races, into
causes, into music, into song, into speech, into painting,
into sculpture, into education, into politics, into commerce,
into the care of the younger kingdoms. Make one or more
than these a sea of life within the Circle of your kingdom.
Stand forth as the Line, flashing through a world you
would conquer to its happiness.
Encircle that world with your will, your wisdom, your
active love, as God drew a Circle to enclose His universe.

the Yoga with which I am concerned ?

Then the Point, with Line revolving with it, vibrates at
right angles to the former vibration, and thus is formed the Cross,
still within the Circle, the Cross which thus
"
proceedeth from the
Father and the Son," the symbol of the Third Logos, the Creative
Mind, the divine Activity now ready to manifest as creator. Then
He manifests Himself as the active Cross, or Svastika.

Annie Besant
So do we come to the fifth great symbol of the Cross

within the Circle formed by the horizontal Line which,
together with the vertical Line, establishes the Cross. We
are at the Cross, the hush as the evolutionary process
begins ; for immediately following is the symbol of the
Svastika,"
1
the whirling Cross which embodies nature's laws
at work, and the friction-imbued interplay play it indeed
is between the evolving Monads.
The vertical Line is the Line of Vitalization, Vivification.
The horizontal Line is the Line of Manifestation, Fecunda-
tion. I invite your attention to The Secret Doctrine (II,
579 ; Adyar ed., IV, 1
19) wherein it is said, quoting the
Bhagavata Parana :
. . . the Eternal Circle ... on whose plane lie crossways
ail the Gods, creatures, and creations born in Space and Time . . .
And I draw your attention to the significant word
"
crossways."

THE CROSS WITHIN THE CIRCLE 219
A Midpoint of
Ascent and
Descent
The Rod of
Power
A Magnetic
Equator
The Forces of
Fructification
The symbol of the horizontal Line is connected with
the descent of the First Logos,
1
to meet the ascending
Second Logos, and is itself a kind of middle point separating
one from the other two aspects of the descent, and one
from the other two aspects of the ascent two aspects of
the Forthgoing, or Nivritti Marga, and two aspects of the
Return, the Pravritti Marga.
The vertical Line vitalizes. The horizontal Line
equilibrates.
Can you complete the Cross within the Circle by
simultaneously expressing the spirit of the two Lines a
beautifully poised lightning flash ? You become as the Rod
of Power,- the Rod of Vitalization, and flash in splendid
brilliance from its northern to its southern pole. You can
almost here the crackling of its electric potencies. You are
immensely alive with Life, with the third aspect of the
Logos. But there is need for the deflection of the Life to
permeate the evolutionary Globe as manifestation begins.
And in some inexplicable way this horizontal Line performs
the functions of what we call the Equator itself a Line of
high magnetic power dividing in ways unknown to me the
northern from the southern hemisphere.
The horizontal Line symbol similarly divides the
northern universe from the southern, and profoundly
modifies the currents set in motion by the vertical Line. I
wonder if I dare suggest that by virtue of the horizontal
Line the forces of fructification work from above downwards
in the southern region, but from below upwards in the
northern region. Which is to say that in the southern
region universality is at work, while in the northern region
individuality is at work. The whole matter is
exceedingly
complicated, and I can only put it before you in
enigmatic form.

220 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
The Cross is a
Universal
Symbol
The Christian
Cross
From Birth to
Ascension
It is, of course, customary and traditional to confine
the Cross idea to the human kingdom, as also to regard it
as essentially a Christian symbol. In fact, it is a universal
symbol, dating from the beginning of Time and finding a
place in most of the great religions. As for its special
relationship with the human kingdom, while from one point
of view it is true, since it is a symbol of those crucifixions
whereby Man swings between Life's twofold aspect spirit
and matter yet is it fundamental in all
kingdoms of nature.
Why does the Christian Cross have its horizontal line
so high up on the vertical line ? It is a matter of cosmic
significance. It is the beginning of the Lotus. You have first
the vertical Line, and then you have the Circle, followed
by the Greek Cross of Lines equally bisected. Then you
have the Christian Cross, the beginning of the coming
upwards from the root, stem down. Then you have the
Tau which is the Lotus Flower, whereas the Christian or
Latin Cross is the Lotus Bud.
The vertical Line is Father, the Cross is Father-
Mother, and the Svastika is the Son. The Christian Cross
is the Lotus Bud and belongs especially to man, is man,
whereas the Tau is the Lotus Flower and belongs especially
to God, and is God.
We are accustomed to imagine that the great episodes
of growth
l
which have as their Christian terms Birth,
Baptism, Transfiguration, Crucifixion, Resurrection, Ascen-
sion," and have other names in other faiths, are entirely
human in their nature, and represent the marvellous
workings of the First Logos in ascending Man. So they do.
But I have no doubt whatever that they are episodes in
every kingdom of nature/ and that we could trace each
one in the life of every Man as he passes through kingdom

Kingship of
Form
The Stages of
Ascent
Christ the
Symbol of the
individual
after kingdom the Birth, for example, being either his
entry into the kingdom, or what I
may call the beginning
of the last stage in the kingdom, as we ordinarily regard
the Birth when we are considering it in relation to the
human kingdom.
The Ascension is
always kingship kingship of the
kingdom, the conquest of its forms and their absorption
into the life of the Man who has achieved.
These episodes mark the great stages of ascent in
each kingdom of nature. But each kingdom is subdivided
into sections, and in each section there is a minor cycle
of episodes reflecting within a smaller area their greater
counterparts. In the sub-human kingdoms these episodes
remain outside the consciousness of the evolving Men.
In the human kingdom Man becomes Self-conscious as to
them only in the final cycle. One of the greatest services
to humanity given by the Christ was the reminder as to the
existence of these episodes, not by talking about them, but
by actually living them before the eyes of the generations
which came after Him.
It is
curiously unfortunate that modern Christianity
fails to perceive that the Christ symbolized our own in-
dividual lives, no matter to what religion we may belong,
that He was telling us we too must become Christs, even
Gods, and unfolded before our gaze the landmarks on
the way.
A PRIMEVAL CROSS
The central atom of the molecule of the more positive
forces of Vitality, and of the Primary or Christ-force from the
Second Logos,
"
is all the time in rapid vibration at right angles to
the surface . . .
springing up from it to a height greater than the
diameter of the disc, and then sinking below to an equal distance,
but repeating this shuttle-like motion several times in a second,"
[a vivid instance of a Point becoming a vertical Line], The more
feminine force of Kundalini is
revolving steadily round and round
a circle.
222 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
When these two forces unite or
"
marry/' as Bishop
Leadbeater describes it in The Chakras, Chapter II, the vigour of
both the vertical and horizontal motions is
greatly increased, and
the resultant Cross-like figure ensues.
The upper half of
"
the marvellously energetic upward and
downward movement of the central atom
"
seems, says Bishop
Leadbeater, "to me to bear a remarkable resemblance to the
Linga which is
frequently to be seen in front of the temples of
Shiva in India. I am told that the Linga is an emblem of creative
power, and that Indian devotees regard it as extending downwards
into the earth to just the same extent as it rises above it."
THE CROSS AND THE SVASTIKA
"
The Greek cross, with equal arms . , . has always been
the token of the first outpouring of divine life through the Third
Aspect of God, or the third member of the Trinity, called among
the Christians God the Holy Ghost, and sometimes the Life-Giver,
who brooded over the waters of space . . .
"
Sometimes the rose is
impressed upon that equal-armed
cross, and then we have the Rose Croix . . . The Maltese cross
is another form of it, with the arms widening or spreading outr
conveying the idea that the force that is
pouring out is
constantly
increasing. Again, we find it with flames shooting out from the
ends of the cross ; and when it is in active revolution, with the
flames trailing at right angles to the arms of the cross, we have
the well-known form called the Svastika . . . The First Outpouring,
typified by the Greek cross, prepares the world for the reception
of life." C, W, Leadbeater, The Hidden Life in Freemasonry,
pp. 110-11.

We now come to the sixth symbol of this form of
Yoga the Svastika, the revolving Cross, sometimes very
beautifully called the Cross of Salvation or Well-being.
1
The Cross formed by the vitalizing and equilibrating
Lines remains. Yet it revolves. How am I to reconcile the
apparent contradiction ?
The Cross-spirit is the background of the Svasiika, but
it
projects its nature into a revolving Cross. In every
symbol there is this projection, for the Father-Mother spirit
in each must give forth the Son.
I think I should explain that the verticle Line would
seem to be the channel of force for God the Father, while
the horizontal Line is the channel of force for God the
Mother, so that the Cross itself symbolizes that union of
Father-spirit with Mother-spirit which, as it were, gives birth
to the Svastika the spirit of the Son, who whirls His way
through the evolutionary process, is the evolutionary
process.

The Line the Father shoots downwards, and in all
simultaneity the Line the Mother manifests may I
safely
say
"

to become with Him a fructifying Soul, a
Soul to fructify souls.
In The Secret Doctrine, the horizontal symbol is taken
to precede the vertical symbol, and I see clearly the signi-
ficance of this.
1
I can only say that, in the vision I
had, the
vertical Line preceded the horizontal. Naturally, The
Secret Doctrine has far higher authority trnn I, especially
in view of the likelihood of a great margin of error in
the case of an individual observer. But I must honestly
place on record what I seemed to see.
In this symbol of the Svastika is revealed the marvel-
lous activity of Life, of Man becoming God. Imagine in
terms of fireworks a revolving Cross. You will perceive at
the extremity the Ring-Pass-Not, the frontiers of its fireful-
ness. You will perceive ring after ring of encircling light, and
possibly also the faint suggestion of a Cross. And from
the revolutions sparks fly out to form a surrounding haze
of fire.
This is as nothing compared with the real whirling
mass of a stupendous evolution. The Fire of Vitalization is
everywhere. The Fire of Equilibration is
everywhere.
Surging through each Atom-Man the Life of God adjusts
him to his Godhead. The mills of God grind slowly, very
slowly, but they grind exceeding true, and mould each Man
unceasingly, unswervingly, relentlessly, to his Divinity.
How wonderful if
you can enter for a brief eternal
moment into this Fire of Evolution losing yourselves in it,
expanding yourselves in it, playing in it, revelling in it, as
you might in a rough sea, swaying backwards and forwards,
yielding to the insistent onrushes of overpowering waves,
feeling a new freedom, a new power, a new joyousness, in
a sea carefree and tyrannical in its indifference.

AH that you feel in the sea you can feel infinitely more

l
whirls because a
God has set in motion the Wheel of the Law, and it is as if
to its
myriad spokes clung innumerable drops the Men
who are to become Gods to be disintegrated as to their
forms time after time until at last a King comes forth to
conquer another kingdom.
In the kingdoms of the Elemental Essences the
Lightning of God breaks and makes and breaks and makes
again. So do the denizens in this kingdom live and die,
and become kings.
In the mineral kingdom the earthquakes, erosions and
other God-sent cataclysms shatter and form, and shatter
and form again. So do the denizens in this kingdom live
and die, and become kings.
In the vegetable kingdom vast upheavals and the inexor-
able, though slow, penetration of Time kill and renew and
kill and renew. So do the denizens in this kingdom live
and die, and become kings.
In the animal kingdom we speak of ruthless nature,
though nature in truth is never ruthless. But in this
kingdom again forms are born, live peacefully or tem-
pestuously, and die away. And their substance, with the
marks upon it of the happenings, rejoins the parent stock,
sharing its experiences new forms issuing therefrom to
clothe the waiting Men. So do the denizens in this kingdom
live and die, and become kings.
All this is the Universal Yoga which cares for Men who
are not yet men. But in the human kingdom Men begin
to become men, though never losing their Manhood, and
come face to face with the Yoga which is
individually theirs.
Still the world and its circumstances surges round and in
them. Not until the last stages of the human kingdom are

Through thin clouds, ere they divide them ;

symphony of the Universal Brotherhood.
I
hope that teachers and parents will in due course
discover the special sound-colour-form note that dwells
in each child-Man within their care, so that while his Faith-
note-colour-form, his Race-note-colour-form, his Nation-
note-colour-form, his rime-note-colour-form, and other
note-colour-form qualities specific to him in virtue of his
surroundings and world and universe membership, may be
stirred to pure expression, also may be stirred in him his
own unique Man-note-colour-form, so that he may move
the more quickly to his own unique Godhead within the
Universal Divinity.
I
hope that, wherever note-colour-forms are perceived
to shine forth feebly and dully, there will be those who shall
know how to give life to both notes and colours and forms.

I conceive that as wisdom unfolds we shall learn to hear
music everywhere, see colour everywhere, perceive form
everywhere, so that, while ever making one music as from
the beginning, we shall make it vaster and more glorious
and true, and while ever making one light as from the
beginning, we shall make that, too, more glorious and true.
And so also build forms gloriously.
I am hoping that in particular all true artists, in what-
ever medium of revelation, will lead the way to this new
world of sound and colour and form, and therefore of
form. Surely is it the dedication of every artist that in his
work he shall glorify the Eternal Life, and in it
sing forth
his Je Deum Laudamus, his Gayatri, hymns to Amen-Ra, to
Ahura-Mazda, or to the Sun-God ; his hymns of praise or
sutras to Purusha, the Illimitable One, to Narayana, the
Self-Moving on the Waters, to Vishnu, the All-Sustainer, to
Shiva, the All-Regenerator; his hymns to Hermes wher-
ever one turns, one finds these beautiful outpourings from
Man to Godhead, a few of which are given in the last
Section of this book.

I have suggested that the Matripadma is to be per-
ceived in terms of Sound and Light and Form, of arche-
typal Sound and Light and Form, swelling from the Seed,
through Bud, into a Perfect Flower of Sound and Light
and Form.
But I have also seen the Lotus of Sound and Light
and Form as a Lotus of Fire, with its petals as flames, and
its centre as heat that is white, so that the white heat
at the centre seems to send forth white flames. And
in the Fire are rays of innumerable hues Fire-Colours, and
also, I venture to say, Fire-Sounds and Fire-Forms. In the
Fire is the Fire-Light. In the Fire is the Fire-Sound.
In the Fire is the Fire-Form. It is the Silent Watcher of
its counterparts in the evolving Life, for it enfolds the

SOUND, COLOUR AND FORM RAYS OF THE LOTUS 235
Beginning, the Way and the End, and the very Life, of all
that is manifest and unmanifest.
Indeed, I have accepted the title The Lotus Fire
for this book because I think that what has perhaps im-
pressed me most in gazing upon these symbols with their
apotheosis in the Lotus Fire is the sense that Fire is the
truest description we can reach for an evolutionary process.
It is
Light. It is Colour. It is Form. But it would almost
seem as if all these three were but qualities of that Fire
which renders unto each stage of the evolutionary process
the things that belong to that stage. Fire renders unto
Man the things that are Man's. It renders unto Kings the
things that appertain to Kings. It renders unto the Gods
the things that are the Gods'. It renders unto God the
things that are His. It renders unto Him all things, for all
things are His. So, of course, do Light and Colour and Form
also. But in some special way Fire seems to minister to that
purificatory intent of evolution which consists not in remov-
ing, or in what we sometimes like to call
"
burning away,"
but in adjusting, so that all
things are in their right places
and in their right relationships.
Fire disintegrates. Fire consumes. Fire returns.
But certainly in the inner regions the inner Fires adjust, and
whatever physical-plane Fire may do on the physical plane,
its reality, or counterpart within, is a pure agent of our Lord
the Adjuster, who is our Lord the Deliverer otherwise named.
Each symbol is a form of Fire the Adjuster. It
portrays Fire in its mode of adjusting, of which burning and
consuming are but physical-plane expressions of other plane
functions of Fire.
And the Lotus is a symbol of Fire Triumphant, of Fire
in apotheosis, just as the Point takes us one step further
and symbolizes Fire in Consummation. The Triumph
merges in the Consummation, as all true victory merges in
added righteousness.

SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
There could be no more precious title for this book
than The Lotus Fire, for the Fire of evolution has burned
to a glorious adjustment, and into the Mystery of the Point
a God enters in order to crown Himself with his Godhead.1
And what is immensely striking is that, in some mys-
terious way, at given periods of time in the periodic dipping-
down of Man into matter-spirit for the great adjustments to
spirit-matter, there flash forth Sound and Light and Form
which shape a Lotus, his Lotus, as unfolded up to the
moment of the given period, and the Lotus of his future
glory.
At birth, and at the passing out of physical incarna-
tion, the Lotus shines as Memory of that which has been
achieved, and as Memory, within the Universal Memory of
God, of the Triumph-to-be.
Remembering somewhere, if not down here, Man.
moves forward on his appointed way to Godhead.

Thou art the Silence of the Point that centres aii ;
Thou art the Silence of the Womb that broods and builds ;
Thou art the Silence of the Line that rules and sways ;
Thou art the Silence of the Globe that mirrors truth ;
Thou art the Silence of the Cross that stands and waits ;
Thou art the Silence of the swiftly moving Wheel ;
Thou art the Silence of the shining Lotus Crown ;
Thou art the Silence of the Point that holds all still.
Let me repeat that just as the Point breathes with the
Ceaseless Breath of God, so does the Web that is the
Womb, so does the Line which is the Divine Measure
of the Life-to-be, and so do the rest of the symbols.'
Again, let me say that the Point remains, even though
it shadows forth the Web that is the Womb. The Web
remains even though it shadows forth the Line. As each
symbol-formula gives birth to the next stage of the great
Unfoldment, it takes upon itself the function of a Silent
Watcher, awaiting the fulfilment of that which it has set in
motion, guarding if I
may say so against any possibility
of non-fulfilment. There are these Silent Watchers in the
cosmic regions. There are Silent Watchers of universes
and worlds. In each Man there dwells his own Silent
Watcher, his Star, his Guardian Angel or Deva, his Monad.
Each of these is the living Promise of Victory.

I think of these mighty Silent Watchers as a great
Company of Archetypes who constitute the real government

But when I think of the Point with its infinitely complex
construction, of the Web that is the Womb with the baffling
intricacy of its tracery, of the Line with its multitude of
contributory Lines, I seem to see the primordial prototypes
l
of the fundamental distinctions we know down here. Out
of these multiple complexities comes the fashioning of the
Men of the new manifestation or dispensation, even though
in the unmanifest itself all such complexities are in embryo.
May I not imagine that every Man in every kingdom of
nature inherently belongs to one or to another of these
archetypes, and is, in the Mystery of the Unity of things,
constituent element in one and all of them ?
Just as we belong to all
Rays, but to one dominantly,
so do we belong to all archetypes, but to one dominantly.
I will not dwell further
2
on this most fascinating topic,
lest an inescapable confusion become worse confounded.
But through this avenue I think we perceive vistas of a
Unity which baffles us by its seeming contradictions, but
which compels our attention by our recognition of its truth
within us.
As I have said, every symbol is the Silent Watcher for
the symbol that succeeds it. So one sees the Cross as the
Silent Watcher of the Svastika. The Svastika cannot go
outside the Cross. The Cross cannot go outside the
Circle. The Circle cannot go outside the Line. The Line
cannot go outside the Web-Womb, and the Web-Womb
cannot go outside the Point. There is a whole Hierarchy
of Cosmic Silent Watchers, and the effect of that in gazing
at these symbols, as can well be imagined, is so stupendous

that it has a devastating reaction on the physical body
itself. It
upsets the whole rhythm of the physical body
and other organisms as well. We are taken entirely outside
of ourselves. It is
only by the magic of the Lord Himself
of Yoga that we are able to see even within the protecting
web of His own aura. Repercussions are inevitable.

pursue the Line a little way along its curvature into the

In the first Stanza of Dzyan there is the cryptic phrase :
" The Eternal Parent, wrapped in her Ever-Invisible Robes,

I venture to believe that the conception of slumbering
is synonymous for a condition of consciousness entirely
beyond the reach of all save those who are Thrice-
Greatest, but in fact indicates seven aeons of unfoldment,
each sui generis, of which we can form not even the
vaguest image.
But it is into these aeons that the Spirit of the Point
passes on its upward way, and it is from out these aeons
that come what I can only call those Supercosmic Forces
which are the very Heart of the Point and of all its deriva-
tives, symbolized as these are in the Web that is the
Womb, the Line, the Circle, the Cross, the Svastika, and

AlT Specially do I see the Line reaching downwards out of
One these aeons, curving down from them, and from our point
of view, curving up into them and vanishing from all
sight
of consciousness. I see the Line both as the Giver of the
Life of the Point, nurtured in the Web that is the Womb,
and also as the Channel for the Life of the All-One, so that I
see a Cosmic Line, but also a Supercosmic Line, as indeed
I
may see a Cosmic Point and a Supercosmic Point, its
Progenitor, and so on in the case of each and every symbol.
The Symbols m | must refer here to the Proem in the first volume of
The Secret
Doctrme Jhe Secret Doctrine (pp. 34-35 ;
Adyar ed., 72-73) in which
there are a number of symbols. It is said :
" The first illustration is a plain disk, Q. The second
in the archaic symbol shows a disk with a point in it, Q
the first differentiation in the periodical manifestations of
the ever-eternal Nature, sexless and infinite,
'
Aditi in
THAT,' or potential Space within abstract Space. In its
third stage the point is transformed into a diameter, Q.
It now symbolizes a divine immaculate Mother-Nature with-
in the all-embracing absolute Infinitude. When the hori-
zontal diameter is crossed by a vertical one, , it becomes
the Mundane Cross. Humanity has reached its Third Root-
Race ; it is the sign for the origin of human Life. When
the circumference disappears and leaves only the -f-, it is a
sign that the fall of man into matter is accomplished, and the
Fourth Race begins. The cross within a circle symbolizes pure
Pantheism ; when the cross is left uninscribed, it becomes
phallic. It had the same and yet other meanings as a Tau
inscribed within a circle, Q ; or as a Thor's Hammer the
so-called Jaina cross, or Svastika, within a circle,
(g).

I confess I shudder a little at what I
regard as the Svastika turning the
wrong way round. 1 know that in orthodox symbology the Svastika appears
thus Yet for me it is only thus conceivable if we look, within the veil of
illusion, at a Svastika from outside it.

By the third symbol the circle divided in two by a
horizontal diameter was meant the first manifestation of
creative Nature still
passive, because feminine. The first
shadowy perception of man connected with procreation is
feminine, because man knows his mother more than his
father. Hence female deities were more sacred than male.
Nature is therefore feminine, and, to a degree, objective
and tangible, and the Spirit Principle which fructifies it, is
concealed. By adding to the horizontal line in the circle,
a perpendicular, the Tau was formed, J" , the oldest form
of the letter. It was the glyph of the Third Root-Race to
the day of its symbolical Fall /.e. f when the separation of
sexes by natural evolution took place when the figure
became (J),
or sexless life modified or separated a double
glyph or symbol. With the sub-races of our Fifth Race it
became in symbology the Sacr', and in Hebrew N'cabvah,
of the first-formed Races ; then it
changed into the
Egyptian emblem of life, 9 ancl still later into the sign of
Venus, $ . Then comes the Svastika (Thor's Hammer, now
the Hermetic Cross), entirely separated from its circle, thus
becoming purely phallic. The esoteric symbol of Kali Yuga
is the five-pointed star reversed, with its two points (horns)
turned heavenward, thus J^, the sign of human sorcery, a
position every Occultist will recognize as one of the '
left-
hand/ and used in ceremonial magic."
Still, for me, the vertical Line
l
precedes the horizontal,
the more so as the latter represents
"
the first manifestation
of created nature," to quote H. P. Blavatsky's own words. I
am concerned with Life before creation.
I also invite your attention as you study this symbol-
ogy of the Circle and the Cross, with the central Point,
to read the suggestive address on "
Symbolism

in
Dr. Besant's The Building of the Kosmos. Indeed, the
whole book may most profitably be studied as an aid to

the understanding of this form of Yoga. She writes : "A
student given to meditation may contemplate the Point and
Line, Cross, Svastika, and study the connection of these
with the Three Logoi."
The reader is also referred to Dr. Besant's illuminating
description of the development and unfoldment of Life
and Form, as given in the Introduction to A Study in
Consciousness.
SYMBOL OF THE MOST HIGH
The Oldest Symbol in the World: "The R.W.M. has as his
jewel the square, which indicates the Third Outpouring of divine

has therefore the same significance as the gavel, his instrument of
government. The symbolism of the gavel is
very profound ; to
explain it I must draw attention to what is
probably the oldest
symbol in the world, [first of the figures below] :

This long line [perpendicular] with two crossed bars upon

the widespread prevalence of the above symbols among the
pygmy race of Africa, and the Cretans, Chaldeans, Egyptians, etc.
The Hidden Life in Freemasonry, p. 93
THE TRANS-HIMALAYAN SYSTEM OF SYMBOLS
Here the vertical Line seems to have first place. It is not
only the First of the two Lines, as mentioned in Jhe Secret
Doctrine, I, 153 (Adyar ed., I, 187), but in the Secret Catechism,
quoted on p. 40 (Adyar ed., I, 77), it is said :
"
The One is the indivisible Point found nowhere, perceived
everywhere during those periods ; it is the Vertical and the
244 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
Horizontal, the Father and the Mother, the summit and base of the
Father, the two extremities of the Mother, reaching in reality
nowhere, for the One is the Ring as also the Rings that are within
that Ring ..."
In this connection it is
interesting to note the making of the
Cross in the Christian Church with its vertical stroke, head to solar
plexus,
"
in the name of the Father and of the Son," (signifying
the Divine Incarnation), followed by the horizontal stroke, left
shoulder to right shoulder,
"
and of the Holy Spirit," (signifying
Ascension).

Each of the symbols to which I have been drawing
your attention involves the creative spirit and leads to
creative activity.
The first symbol the Point expresses in a wonderful
way the positive immanence of creative activity, as I
have suggested in other words, creative activity straining
at the leash.
The second symbol the Web-Womb expresses the
setting for creative activity, as it were, the preparation of
the altar of sacrifice.
The third symbol the Line-Sound from the Silences
expresses birth.
The fourth symbol the Circle-Globe is a further
birth development.
The fifth symbol the Cross brings us down into
very evolution itself.
The sixth symbol the Svastika is the throbbing of
the creative spirit in the machinery of its activity.

The seventh symbol the Lotus is the glorification
of the creative spirit.
It is all a going forth, a giving birth. And, as I have
said, there is birth on every plane of what we call nature.
Only on the physical plane do we need two for certain
specific creative purposes, an actual physical plane division.
The dual aspect of the individuality is not enough on the
physical plane for reproductive purposes. There must be
the man-woman and the woman-man. But the principle
is the same. Creativeness is for growth. It is
dynamic.
It exalts the creator or, as on the physical plane, the
creators, in
revealing Godliness.
I am of the opinion that this form of Symbolic Yoga
has an advantage over some other forms in that it
begins
exclusively from above and not from below. In this form
of Yoga the starting-point is the highest region of con-
sciousness available for contact, though there must be a
preliminary and rapid fulfilment of lower entanglements.
Such fulfilment should be by an act of Will, and as little as
possible a matter of slow process of conquest.
In this form of Yoga there are required no physical
exercises, no breathing practices, no special physical
posture, no recitations of words or phrases, no special
times for its expression. Quickly the student retires within
to his Highest Self, and there realizes the intent of the
posture a posture which is an attitude and not a physical
pose, though for convenience a certain physical pose is
later recommended.1
Thus does he create a standard of forthgoing in the
highest regions of his working consciousness, and the
creative spirit is
pure, holy and sacramental from the very
beginning. As he adopts posture after posture of the
great forthgoing, the standard is maintained. So is it that
from Heaven above a spiritual rhythm is established which

calls to Earth below for a perfect echo. On the physical
plane the echo lives in the physical creative act, and thus can
be no other than a noble, holy and veritable sacrament.
Any individual seeking to practise this Yoga in the inner
worlds and denying it in the outer worlds is doomed to
cataclysmic disaster. He will be terribly consumed by the
friction he arouses between the two. The force he must
needs generate above, in however slight a measure, will
cause him to plunge downwards not only into the nega-
tion of life, the inevitable result of pouring the waters
of lustful desire upon the fire of creation, but also possibly
into the realms of Pan, to which humanity may not belong
without incurring madness. These realms are approached
and perhaps entered, by the way, whenever there is
unrhythmic sexual activity, as is the case in self-abuse or
between persons of the same sex.
All this is
against the Law, and those who flout the
Law, for whatever reason, must be mended by the Law,
not as by some outside ruthless power, but by the in-
dividual himself as God. He is the Law, and he breaks
his lower self for the sake of freeing his higher. It has
to be understood, however, that this negation of life may
be brought about not only on the physical plane, but on
every other plane up to the lower mental. The creative
spirit may be turned downwards at any of these stages.
We have evidences of this in every field of life at the
present time in politics, in statecraft, in religion, in industry,
in the arts, sciences and philosophies. There are men and
women who are great on the downward arc, on that arc
which involves the slowing down of life's vibrations. For,
be it remembered that in the physical world today life has
reached its slowest safe rate of vibration. To go still more
slowly leads straight to cataclysm. Yet there are those
who are thus leading the world to cataclysm through using
wrongly the creative spirit.

the Point ? Of course, I do not see
it at all with any outward senses, still less with the physical
eyes, nor even with that inner eye which the poet tells us
is the bliss of solitude. I see it with the whole of myself,
with the all of my Self that I am able to contact. I
photo-
graph it, as it were, or it is
photographed upon me. It is
an impression.
To analyse that impression is almost impossible, for
every description limits and distorts it. Indeed, I
might
almost say that whatever else it
may be, it is not that which
I describe it to be. It is
infinitely more, and infinitely
different.
But if I must try to paint some picture, I can only say
that I have to reduce to purely physical pigments on to a
flat surface a number of whirling, vibrating, pulsating multi-
dimensional Realities, gorgeously rich in colour, sounding
forth a wealth of sound in melody and resultant symphony,
and manifest in forms of which the forms we know in this
outer world are but fragmentary imperfections.
How then do I
" see
"
the Point ? I see it as a form-
less, pulsating radiation of what I can only call Lightning-
White waves, impulses. Note please the word " formless
"
THE POINT AND ITS DAUGHTER-SYMBOLS 249
which is used in the sense of the antithesis of form, or
rather perhaps of a
" that
"
which is the fons et or/go of
the formless and the form. At once, you see, I am in
difficulties, for I am trying to describe within a formful
world a super-formful reality. Still, you must make the best
you can of the contradictions and obscurities, for without
them I could give no description at all. A clear description
would no less be a false description.
I see this radiance as a mighty Bubble contracting and
expanding, breathing inwards and breathing outwards under
the potency of the Ceaseless Breath of God, to quote the
Stanza of Dzyan.
Yet in the Lightning-Whiteness I see every colour of
the Eternal Rainbow of Light contributing its uniqueness to
the White of the Lightning, yet merged in it
imperceptible.
Being a Radiance there is no hard and fast circum-
ference, yet it has its Law which, as one might almost say,
circumscribes it.
I see this Radiance as an inconceivable Sun with forth-
issuing flames of supernal purity.
Concentration And I see the Point as twofold the concentration of
Manifestation
an evolutionary aeon, the consummation of a Godhead of
Divine Majesty, and also as a manifestation of a going forth,
of a God giving forth His Godhead that a myriad Gods
may in their turn achieve their Godhead.
There is a Consummation That is one aspect of the
Point. There is a Forthgoing. That is the other aspect of the
Point. A concentration into a Point of infinitude. A forth-
going into a sea of heretofore undifferentiated spirit-matter.
We may think of our Lord the Sun as an expression
of the Point's Forthgoing. Our Lord the Sun is a Point,
but we see Him as giving forth His Godhead that a myriad
Gods ourselves in all the kingdoms of His nature may in
our turn, arising out of the sea of undifferentiated spirit-
matter, achieve our Godhead.

The Point is the most supremely living Life if I
may

It is

perpetual,

electric white, I
might almost say silver-white. And I
would refer you to my observations on its Stillness, its
Silence, its Darkness, its Sound, its
Light, its Movementless
Poise, its ceaseless Radiance.
How helpless I feel to try to describe ! But perhaps in
all the inevitable medley someone is
seeing Design, in all
the seeming chaos, someone is
seeing Cosmos.
Now let me say that the Point has a twofold nature in
this that it I
ought really to say
"
She-He," or, better still,
an apotheosis of all differentiation is
evolving on its own
plane while active on every plane which constitutes a
universe.
I see nowhere a completion of the evolutionary pro-
cess. Everything, however sublime, is a Less compared
with a More beyond. So do I
cognize in the Point a
process of still more marvellous resolution in terms of a
Beyond, an adjustment to yet nobler, utterly impenetrable
and unattainable heights, heights which are lost in the
clouds which veil from us the excess of Glory.
I* add to my seeing of the Point this quality, which I
do not in the least understand. Yet it is there, and I
register a section of the Spiritual Spectrum beyond the
perception of all save those who have reached the begin-
nings of a vision of that which becomes known when Time
ceases to be.
When we gaze upon the Forthgoing, we at once
perceive what can only be called a modification, a form-
creating vibration which resolves itself into what I have
called the Web that is the Womb the Web which consti-
tutes the Womb of the universe-to-be. It is all within the

Point. There can be nothing outside this metaphysical
immensity.
There is but a shimmering, a scintillation, a kaleidos-
copic movement, and a function of the Point is born, a
symbol comes to life, though it has never been otherwise
than alive.
The Point makes sacrifice, and symbol after symbol is
born. First, the Web that is the Womb a profusion of
web-like, gossamer colour, almost a sack. Out of the
Lightning-White the Rainbow is born with every colour
sending forth its energy. All that the Point is in radiance,
in pulsation, in colour, in form, in sound, in depth, in ex-
panse, that also is the Web that is the Womb, but in a
concentration I
might almost say, in a place. The Point
blesses an area, and the Web that is the Womb is born.
As I see this birth, I think at once of a great nebula,
say the nebula of Orion, or one or another of these mighty
spiral Webs which are in very truth Wombs. A nebula is
created, crystallized, by the magic of the Point, and it is the
Seed of a universe-to-be and of the Gods who are to
achieve Godhead.
And, as I think of the nebula, I think of those sublime
sweeps of infinite majesty and extent which characterize
each one of the symbols, and supremely the Point itself.
The vastness of the Point, its immeasurable sweep of sound,
of colour, of form, of Silence, of Darkness, are reproduced
in each one of its
daughter-symbols if I
may so call them.
It is so largely because of this that not one of them can be
reproduced without offence and blasphemy. All that is
vital in each is
impossible to express. Only the insignificant
can be reproduced.
Within the Web that is the Womb there comes about
a concentration, a birth, an immaculate conception, and
forth flashes the Line or should I not more truly say, a
curvature which appears as a Line ? the Divine Measure
252 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
of the Forthgoing, in accordance with the measure of which
the Ring-Pass-Not circumference will be limited, and the
very Call itself directed in some mysterious way to those
Men of the Sea, Gods-to-be and Gods-in-the-Becoming,
who shall arise from unconscious Divinity to Self-conscious
Godhead.
Out of the nebula which is the Forthgoing of the
Point is churned the Line of Measurement which is the "I"
of the future universe, its Monad or Ego. Into the North
ascends the Curvature. Into the South the Curvature de-
scends. From the very heart of the Web that is the Womb
it
proceeds northwards and southwards in infinite vibrations.
Or should I not rather say, the Line flashes upwards to its
North, to the true North of the universe-to-be, downwards
to its South, to the true South of the universe-to-be ? And
the Line is
"
great
"
with the Circle which is to come.
Suggestive of my perception of this macrocosmic Line
is the figure on Plate 26 in Bishop Leadbeater's The Science
of the Sacraments. But the Line shoots upwards and down-
wards like a piston-rod. I
might add that the bubble effects
shown in the various Plates are not dissimilar from those of
the symbols, except that in the case of all the symbols
save the Point in its Consummation, where there is the tone
of Lightning-White there is a brilliancy of colours com-
pared with which even the most beautiful reproductions are
dead, as dead as the most beautifully painted picture in
comparison with a sunset.

for I cannot perceive either the whence or the whither, not
even any point in the curvature. I
only know that curvature
is a law of nature. Straightness is a word coined for con-
venience, and there can be no such thing as a definition of
a straight line, for no line is
straight. The shortest distance
between two points is a curve.

All organs curve towards the Light be they particles

are induced by the stimulus of Light upon the former.
Upon the latter expansion and acceleration are induced.
I
perceive that the spinal column as we know it in
various types of creatures is the outward and visible symbol
of the Line, and I see that the very spinal column itself is
but the visible part of a spinal spectrum which measures
each individual's Divinity. If
only I could perceive the
extension of the spinal column, I should perceive the whole
of the evolutionary process of an individual and of the very
universe itself.
There is, I
suppose, a macrocosmic circle of which the
spinal column is but a point. But my many limitations cry
halt to me before I have traversed more than a tiny
fragment of the distance along the spinal column and its
infinite projection.
I have associated lightning-white with the Point in
terms of its Consummation. I have associated rainbow-
opalescence with the Point in terms of its Forthgoing, and
with the Web that is the Womb. The Line seems to
reproduce the lightning-white motif of the Point in its Con-
summation, probably because the Line measures the Con-
sumation-to-be achieved by the universe-to-be,
I associate with the Circle, which is the extension of
the Line, a yellow and a green of undepictable hues. But
as background, there is
always the Point and the Web that
is the Womb with their characteristics in terms of colour.
Immediately as I write these words there comes the
thought that there are sounds no less than colours as
characteristic of each symbol.

to be able to elucidate the sound. The thunder-roll is

the Line, its projection.
And in an instant of eternity the horizontal Line a

And more and more the forms whirl, pulsate, are
torrential in their movements. From the Silence of the
Point in Consummation begins the Sound of the Point in
Forthgoing. From the Darkness of the Point in Consum-
mation begins the Light of the Point in
Forthgoing. And
then Sound and Light seem, as it were, to dance as the
duality born of the Unity. They dance together, each in
its own rhythm, and expressing its own part in the building
of the Self-consciousness-to-be.
How can this be depicted on a piece of paper !
I see these sequences as following one another in
such instantaneous succession that I find myself omitting to
record the event of supreme significance the response to

divine, unconscious individualities sleeping within the im-
mensities of what I must call space, though I do not know
what the word can mean at these high levels. These
individualities are Men. They are Gods. They are every-
thing, and therefore they are also nothing. The Point in
its aspect of Forthgoing is their Godfather in the most
literal sense of this much misused word. They are the
Godchildren. They are the children who are Gods, for
they are the Sons of God. They have belonged from the
very beginning to the God who is
calling them forth,
They have been His from the time when He was but a
Man of the Sea. And now His triumph is their awakening.
His Call is the summons for which they have been waiting,
as there are those who are waiting the summons even of
ourselves. They flood the Circle He has established for
them, and then He flashes forth the Line which is horizon-
tal, that a Cross of growth may whirl them to their
fruition.

Here we have a very rainbow of colour, a wealth of sound

unfolding into Self-consciousness. The Men are on
their way to their Godhead.

Seeds that are Men into the Lotuses that are Gods, so that
the universe begins to be peopled with Gods who are
Lotuses, and we begin to see that the whole universe is
and was a Lotus. It is as if each symbol contributed
towards a flowing of the universe-stream into a myriad
Lotuses, and that the universe resolves itself into a Lotus
with the Point triumphant at its heart. And then the
resolution of the Lotuses themselves, of the Universe-Lotus

The Lotus is the apotheosis of form which directly merges
into the Fullness of Life.
But I am going beyond my depth as usual, I
might
say. There is but One Lotus. Yet there are a myriad
Lotuses. There is but One Life. Yet there are a myriad
independent Lives. There is but One Breath.
1
Yet not
only are there innumerable breathings, there are also
specialized aspects of the One Breath. For there is the
breathing of the heart of the Lotus, There is the breath-
ing of the head of the Lotus. There is the breathing of
each cosmic organ of the Divine Lotus. And the Men of
the Sea are differentiated from the beginning as to their
ultimate functions in their final consummation. How in-

suppose I am
perceiving a feeble shadow of a Truth which belongs to

by no means reached, but which I can dimly know for it

Of things invisible to mortal sight. --Milton
Having contacted a number of realities, to a certain
extent clarified through symbols, I must now begin to
seek how I
may probe their constitutive elements, their
extents, their heights, their depths. Naturally, I shall bring
to bear upon such probing the personal equation of the
particular reality to which I now feel drawn the reality of
which the Line is the symbol. I shall tend to endow with
Line-ness every one of the realities and to this extent,
together with my comparative lack of growth, vitiate
their respective purities. But this cannot be helped. The
student will take it into consideration, and will guard against
it as best he may.
To probe means to identify myself, and to do so is
impossible save to the extent to which the Point and I a
Point in the becoming are one in nature, in essence, with
the saving grace of that uniqueness which differentiates
each individuality from every other individuality. I can
only to the minutest degree turn myself into a laboratory
with the necessary equipment to perform an experiment
in identification an experiment which, in all
possible
permutations and combinations, is
going on in
every
258 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
The Laboratory

Point-Intensity
laboratory throughout the world, concealed though its
nature may be in a variety of forms.
I want to stress the fact of my turning myself as best
I can into a laboratory, for not only is this a true statement
of the nature of the evolutionary way, it is also the goal
towards which science in all its experiments must work.
The occultist is a well-equipped laboratory, and every in-
dividual must become a laboratory in growing Self-con-
sciousness so that he ceases to be limited by man-made
instruments, marvellous though these undoubtedly are. He
must be able to perform within himself every experiment any
laboratory can perform and many, many more in addition.
No laboratory on earth can bring me to a conception
of the Point. But the laboratory which is my Self can so
bring me, within the powers it
possesses as a result of the
experiences through which I have passed.
I. THE POINT : INTENSITY
Let me then place the Point I ask pardon for the
impertinence within my laboratory, and let me see what
I can make of it as I venture to subject it to those super-
physical instruments with which the laboratory is
equipped.
I see that it is a Point indeed which I have brought.
I could have brought no other form to convey the sense
of Pointness, for only the Point-idea gives to me, conveys to
me, a sense of an omnipotent intensity which needs no
immeasurable vastness, no limitlessness, to contain it. True,
its omnipotent intensity can and does indeed pervade limit-
lessness. But more significant is the fact that its omni-
potent intensity can express itself in all fullness within the
inconceivably microscopic compass of what we call a Point.
And when it does so, there is the entrancing spectacle of
an almost perceived identity between the infinitely small
and the infinitely large.

See the next Chapter ; also Chapter 7 in this Book Two.
THE LABORATORY OF IDENTIFICATION 259
A Fullness
A Summit
A Grain of Sand
Will. Truth.
Movement
To myself, being far more relative than absolute,
though I must be absolute no less than relative, a relative is
infinitely more conceivable than an absolute. Thus is it that
the supreme intensity of what I must from my small hill of
perception call an absolute Divinity is more discernible in
terms of a microcosm than of a macrocosm. The intensity
is better perceived in its
quality of illimitable intenseness
when contained within the infinitely small than when it is
expanded into the infinitely large.
But what is the nature of this intensity ? To me it is as an
infinitely compact fullness from which nothing is left out.
Strictly speaking, this statement is untrue, for never is
lacking
a more to any fullness, never is there aught but lessness, on
the frontiers of which and where are frontiers not ? a.
more is
awaiting absorption.
But the Point represents that which, to the loftiest
conceptions of achievement available to human or to super-
human ken, is
towering above them all in that which,
even from the loftiest below, seems to be a supreme
finality, an end, a height which is as an ultimate
summit.
And to increase beyond all
gauging the sense of its
finality it discloses itself as a Point, not as a distance but as
a here, not as an eternity but as a now, not as a space
but as an atom, not as a mountain but as a grain of
sand. And in that very disclosure it asserts, as other-
wise it could not assert to my so limited understanding, its
omnipresence, its omniscience, its omnipotence. In its
very
illusion of limitation it asserts, as otherwise it could not
assert, its universality. And because it is a Point it is a
universe and literally infinitely more.
But its intensity is a fullness crammed with that Will,
that Truth, that Movement which are the apotheoses of the
whole gamut of the experiences encountered in every king-
dom of nature, in the unknown kingdoms no less than in

the known. And the Will is
Purpose, the truth is Law,
and the Movement is
Glory.
I see that I am right in my convergence idea, in
the conception that there is a concentration into a Point,
or rather a convergence which demands the Point-idea
for its fulfilment. When I translate my perception into
sound terms, I see all sounds, all combinations of sound,
converging from all
regions of the expanded universe-
individuality into a Point which becomes vibrant with them
all. The Point is a music-intensity, is crammed with music
as if there could be room for naught else.
And when I translate my perception into colour terms
or form terms, I see all colours, all forms, all combinations
of colours and forms, converging from all regions of the
expanded universe-individuality into a Point which becomes
vibrant with them all. The Point is a colour-intensity, a
form-intensity, is crammed with both as if there could be
room for naught else. As the poet beautifully describes
earth as being crammed with heaven, so is the Point
crammed with Divinity, a Divinity of which we can have
no conception save to the extent to which such Divinity is
Self-conscious within us.
Into Silence, into Darkness, into No-Sound, into No-
Colour, dissolves the many-origined intensity. Into supreme
Form, into No-Form, dissolves the many-origined intensity.
And the ecstatic Hush of Perfected Divinity is the supreme
Apotheosis and Fulfilment. Such is the Consummation.
But there is no long waiting, save as the Hush is indeed
eternal, for the Forthgoing, for the Call to the Men who
wait within the Sea of Undifferentiation.
Within the No- Form is the Call born. Within the No-
Sound is the Call born. Within the No-Colour is the Call
born. Within the Silence and the Darkness is the Call born.
These are the Divine Parents of the Call, and They send
forth the Call to the Men who have the ears to hear it.

What is the Call ? It is the composite vibration-
rhythm of the constituent elements of the Point in its Con-
summation aspect. The Call is a self-projection, a sending
forth of a perfect rhythm upon the Sea of the Unmanifest.
To adapt the third verse of Genesis, the Spirit of the Point
moved upon the Sea of the Unmanifest. And those who
were from the beginning appointed to be children of the
Point arose from the Sea and entered into the Ring-Pass-Not
Circle-Globe which had been prepared for their growing.
So do we perceive that the substance of the Point is
the essence of an evolutionary process which has led a Man
to become a God. It is the sum-total of every unfoldment
of his consciousness from the moment of differentiation-
manifestation, through every stage of growth, until Self-con-
scious Divinity has been thus achieved. It is as if each step
of his way resulted in the fashioning of a brick of experi-
ence-matter to be assigned to its due place in the Temple
of Divinity in which the Man will dwell when he becomes
a God.
As the Way of Experience is trodden, the material for
the building accumulates, and little by little the Temple itself
begins to assume its
predestined form. At last the Temple
is
complete, and a God dwells therein, and from the inner
shrine His Call goes forth to those Men who from time im-
memorial are of His Line to begin the building of their Temples
and to call forth their Godhead in the fullness of time.
II. THE WEB-WOMB : CREATIVENESS
I then come to the sequences of the Forthgoing, be-
ginning with the Web that is the Womb. At this point the
absolute whiteness of the Point, a whiteness nowhere known
on earth since it is the whiteness of heaven, quivers this
is the best word I can think of into its constituent ele-
ments, in terms of colour, of sound, of form. It is colour
that gains my attention, and I see an opalescence, a
262 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT

created

Growth

Experience are
plumbed
rainbow, of colours, though I also see an opalescence, a
rainbow, of sounds and of forms.
This Web that is the Womb is the Point in its creative
aspect, as sui generis it is the Point in its Intensity aspect.
All I have just described as constituting the Point's Intensity
is alive with creative potentiality. The quality of creative-
ness exists in every form, in every sound, in every colour.
I do not like to say
"
reproductiveness," for my experience
is that the whole spirit of creation is not to multiply sameness,
not to multiply identities, but to call differences to awaken,
to call into Self-consciousness innumerable variations on a
specific theme. The creative aspect of the Point, there-
fore, lies in the sounding of a fundamental theme so much
concession may we make to the element of sameness so
that all life that is like-themed may hear and awaken, but
no less that such life may awaken to its variations on the
theme, that each Man-individuality thus aroused may ex-
press his difference, his uniqueness, his specific variation.
The very opalescence which distinguishes the Web
that is the Womb from the Father-Mother Point is a Call to
difference, while the primordial concealed whiteness is a
Call to identity.
III. THE LINE: MEASUREMENT
What is it that becomes created ? Measurement.
When a child is born on the physical plane, it is born unto
a measurement. Its span of growth is predetermined.
And we may thus say that a measurement incarnates, a
particular fragment of the evolutionary way is measured
out, is
appointed, for treading.
But in the case of this cosmic symbol there is born a
measurement for the universe-to-be, a Divine Yard-Stick,
a Plumb-Line, as I have called it.
Is it not constituted of what I can only call Matrix Ex-
perience, Archetypal Experience, Measurement Experience,
THE LABORATORY OF IDENTIFICATION 263
Centres of

curve the

infinite
Measurement
whereby are set the limits of experience up into the
heights, down into the depths ? The evolutionary waves
cannot extend outwards beyond a certain point. They
cannot rise beyond a certain point. There cannot be
depths of descent beyond a certain point.
Will is
dominantly characteristic of this symbol, so we
find it coloured by what may be called the colour of Will
electric blue.
I am stating that the Line is curved, indeed that
curvature is characteristic of each and every symbol.
1
This
Line, a Line of Universe Measurement, must needs be
curved because of gravitational attraction of a nature which
entirely eludes my understanding. In every universe there
is a Centre of Attraction towards which the whole universe
converges. And this is true of any multiplication of
universes, whether in arithmetical or geometrical progression
(which reminds me that I seem to see some universes
working according to arithmetical and other universes
according to geometrical progression). The principle of
curvature depends upon the fact of Centres of Attraction,
if I
may so call them, though in fact they are probably,
almost certainly, Centres of Forth-welling even more. But
there is a peculiar relation between the Forth-welling and
the Attraction which I can only express by the picture of a
man finding his way to a well and drawing water therefrom.
He is
irresistibly drawn to the well, but the well blesses
him with its water. There is the curvature. But there
is also a response to the curvature, so that we may
say that the very curvature itself is
part of the evolu-
tionary process.
Hence, this electric blue Line is a section of a Super-
cosmic Line, is a fragment of a still more infinite measure-
ment by which vaster vastnesses are measured, and to
vastness there seems no end.

Like the Point it is

say that like

fire the Fire of the Point, the Fire of the Web that is the
Womb, the Fire that is the Line, the Fire that is the Circle-
Globe, the Fire that is the Cross, the Fire that is the
Svastika, the Fire that is the Lotus this being the supreme
expression of Fire outbreathed, just as the Point is the
supreme expression of Fire inbreathed, indrawn, withdrawn.
How little we have studied, especially in Yoga, the Science
of Friction. Yet is it the very heart of growth, of that
duality which holds together in friction.
This Line, as I have so constantly to be saying, is rep-
resented in the human form as the spine, and some day
we shall find a science of medicine arising which will make
the spine its fundamental basis, and read the constitution of
the individual in terms of his spinal condition and curvature.
The astrologer, too, will begin to recognize the spine as a
very vital element in casting a horoscope. The spine is
largely ignored because it is not understood, and ignorance
of it causes much to lie hidden of essential value in the
determination of an individual's nature, past, present
and future.
IV. THE CIRCLE-GLOBE : LIMITATION-PROTECTION
The Line being determined, there is instant occasion
for the appearance of the Circle which is the Ring-Pass-Not
for the evolution-to-be. The same elements constitutive of
the Point, the Web that is the Womb, and the Line, con-
stitute the Circle. The Circle embodies, as it seems in
particular measure, the vibration-octaves, the rhythm-
octaves, of that Call which produces both the response
from Men of the Sea and the whole machinery for their
unfoldment. The Circle is in a sense, but only in a sense,
irresponsive to all vibrations, all
rhythms, outside those
THE LABORATORY OF IDENTIFICATION 265
Green-Yellow
Matrix
Guardian-
Womb
octaves of which it is
composed, rejects them whether they
come from outside or from within. We may indeed call
the Circle the Silent Watcher of the evolutionary system
now being brought into activity. And since it
gives birth
to innumerable circles identical with it, we have the
universe-globe, of which the various world-globes form
part, from which they are duly derived. But it would
seem that there is
always a possibility of a movement
beyond the appointed octaves, reflecting, as far as I
can perceive, the very important fact that there are octaves
beyond the octaves of any individual universe, and that
these octaves are necessarily inherent in every universe on
the principle of the unity of all life. The whole gamut of
cosmic octaves of every nature is present in the restricted
gamut of any individual universe. Hence the need for
the Ring-Pass-Not. Hence the great principle of the Silent
Watcher. Hence, indeed, the probably occasional varia-
tions from an appointed octave, not necessarily involving
the intervention of the Ring-Pass-Not or the Silent
Watcher, but definitely involving a variation from the
set theme.
I am identifying with the Circle-Globe a green-yellow
colour-scheme. But I am for the moment unable to deter-
mine its particular sound-octave or its form-octave either.
I wonder why the colour conception stands out so much
more prominently than the sound or form scheme,
especially since I
regard myself as a
"
sound "-man.
Let me repeat, however, that the substance of
the Circle-Globe seems much more definite static, I
was about to say than the substance of the preceding
symbols. Perhaps its Guardian function involves this, Oh
the other hand, it
definitely reflects the Web that is the
Womb, for a Globe is a Web. It is a Womb. It is a Web-
Womb for the fructification of a Wave of Men out of the

We then come to the horizontal Line, fiery red in
colour, though to me unidentifiable as to sound and form,
which flashes forth almost instantaneously with the coming
into being of the Circle.
What is its nature ? What is its
origin ? Its origin is
clearly the Web that is the Womb. It is the twin of the
vertical Line. It
completes the principle of duality for the
growth that is about to begin. It unites its fiery red with the
electric blue of its shall I
say older twin, and the resulting
purple safeguards the transition from Man-God to God-
Man the very purpose of the duality. Purple the colour of
uplift, of protection, of the arising of the Lotus through
mud and water to air, of the dawn of sunlight out of the
darkness. Purple is
always the herald of constructive cata-
strophe, of release, even though the appearance may be
that of destructive catastrophe.
The Cross, with the male perpendicular Line and the
female horizontal Line, symbolizes creative readiness within
the great Circle of Limitation, of Purpose, of Definition.
Such is its nature. Inevitably one wonders why the per-
pendicular Line is bisected, is not crossed at a lower level.
If a Cross can have deep meaning when the horizontal Line
is well above the middle point, should it not also have a
corresponding meaning when the horizontal Line is well be-
low the middle point ? I am inclined to think it has, and
that the movement of the horizontal Line upwards on the
vertical Line is a symbol of the evolutionary process, so that
at a certain evolutionary point we reach the crucifixion, the
crux ansata, the Tao, whence it is but a step to the resur-
rection and the ascension to use the Christian termino-
logy. On the other hand, the vertical Line bisected by the
horizontal Line represents in the Cross thus formed duality
THE LABORATORY OF IDENTIFICATION 267
in a perfect harmonization between its two constitutive
elements, the perfect balance between the two. This per-
fect balance reveals the essential identity of the two, and it
is the whirling of the perfectly balanced Cross that ensures
the steady pulsation of the evolutionary process to its con-
summation in the Point. First is established the perfect
Cross perfect, that is, from the point of view of balance
and then within such perfect Cross the horizontal Line begins
below and rises stage by stage to the heights of the true
crucifixion at which the God in man glorifies the manhood
in God,
"
My God, how Thou dost glorify me !
"
VI THE SVASTIKA : FRICTION WHEEL OF SALVATION
From Cross From the static to the dynamic there is but a flash of
static to Cross
dynamic that cosmic sequence whereby one symbol is differentiated
from another, and the Cross static transmutes itself into the
Cross dynamic the Svastika. It is at this point that I see
so clearly the distinction between the form and the life of
each symbol. In a sense each is both form and life, though
in the case of the Point and the Web that is the Womb the
life side seems to be in, and the form side out of, perspect-
ive. The Line seems to sound the form side with great
definition, as does the Circle-Globe, though indeed the life
side has really equal prominence. But when I come to the
Cross, and still more when I come to the Cross in move-
ment, I
perceive an inexorableness which is the very incar-
nation, the direct expression, of Law, of Light, of Life, of
the very Will of God. It is the Life of God beating upon
the Life of Man, with no intercession, no intermediary, of
form. Of course, the form is there, but it would seem to be
there simply because it must be there. There could not, in
these regions, be life without form, even though, as it were,
the form has little to do. I
see, therefore, as substance of this
whirling Svastika, a Law-Light-Life combination of ingredients
which gives a very special appearance of relentlessness

ing Self-consciousness. The well-known phrase "broken

"
that horrible physical torture of earlier
periods of history, perpetuated in modern days in terms of
the mind, so that the inquisition spirit of today is
breaking
its victims on the wheel of the mind, a terrible desecration
of the Wheel of the Law as has been this mighty power
from time immemorial occurs to me, for indeed is it
ignorance which is broken upon the Wheel of the Love of
God, the Wheel of His Salvation, the Svastika.
I must insist, for I fear the fact may escape recogni-
tion, that I can make no distinction between matter and
spirit in considering the substance of any of the symbols.
Tangibility is characteristic of the substance of each, though
not that physical tangibility which we sometimes think to be
the only tangibility. There are no intangible regions any-
where. And more substantial are the substances of these
symbols than the substance we are pleased to call Matter.
I have only differentiated between life and form for con-
venience' sake, for form is a mode of life, nothing more
and nothing less. So that when we think of life as ensoul-
ing form, we are in fact thinking of one mode of life as
ensouling another. Hence, when we think of the Svastika
revolving within the Circle-Globe crammed as this is
by
the Men of the Sea, we are thinking of life as friction-
ing upon life, of matter as frictioning upon matter
interpenetration, perhaps, but no less a frictioning on
that account.
Thus, at the most, the difference between one symbol
and another is but a difference of mode of life, a ringing
of the changes upon the great octaves of life which brings
us into a fascinating consideration of the nature of the
octaves of life, of the octaves of the universes, of the
octaves of the octaves far beyond all these of what must
THE LABORATORY OF IDENTIFICATION 269

be innumerable cosmic octaves of ... of what? In this
form of Symbolic Yoga, the symbols presented to me con-
stitute an octave,
1
but the relation of this octave to other
octaves of similar rate of vibration is
beyond me altogether,
just as the actual rate of vibration of the symbols lies in
deepest obscurity.
But I am trying to discover little by little the vastness-
es that are 'hidden from me, and in the fullness of time I
hope to know more. For the moment the joy of seeking
is its own reward. I have no particular ambition to find,
for I know that every discovery must be a less compared
with the discovery which lies immediately beyond ; and
there is as much satisfaction of the right kind in seeking as
in finding, for seeking is
finding. How well I am aware
that every word I have written in this book conveys but a
dark shadow of the truth, even with the most generous
interpretation placed upon it. But I
try to keep on saying
so, that the reader shall as soon as may be hurry away
from the book and its
unveiling, such as it is, in order to
seek, find and tread his own way of revelation.
VII. THE LOTUS: FIRE-FLOWER OF FRUITION
It is but an extension of the whole conception of the
symbols now to perceive to appear the very Lotus form
itself as symbol of the entry of the Men of the Sea into
the Godhead of each of them. The Lotus is the integra-
tion of the symbols preceding it, the treasure-house of the
sum-total of all the experiences, of all the friction, of all
the distillation of the experiences into a Law, a Light, a
Life or Will. The Lotus is the symbol of Fruition, and
there remains now but the distillation of that fruition into
the Intensity of the Point, whereby a Consummaton is
achieved, Divinity is accomplished, the Way is set for the
attaining of still nobler heights, and the time comes for a

Occult Catechism
The above extract came to me after I had already
written that which follows. It seems to me to be very
appropriate to the general theme which I am trying to
elaborate.
What is In Symbolic Yoga the Point represents an attempt to
Infinitude ?
convey in the form most acceptable to the student an idea
of a certain mode of Infinitude, since the achievement by
man of his Godhead is an entry into a Self-conscious In-
finitude out of a dwelling in an Infinitude with regard to
which there has been little, if
any, Self-consciousness at
the most intermittent flashes of such Self-consciousness.

An Infinite
Contraction-
Expansion

Outbreaking
Localized
Infinitude
The Point describes Infinitude in terms of the almost
inconceivably microscopic, so as to convey the impression
that the conception of Space does not in fact enter into the
idea of Infinitude. Therefore, Infinitude may be an infinite
expansion or it may be an infinite contraction. Further-
more, the whole of the evolutionary process is con-
cerned with Infinitude, either as the microscopic or as
the macroscopic. What we may call an undifferentiated
particle of consciousness may possibly not be at all un-
differentiated. And what we call finite may in truth be
not at all finite. But there is
very little that can be said
about this since we cannot know what Undifferentiation
or Infinitude really mean. They are just words, terms,
ideas, inferences.
Hence, if I
speak of the expanding and contracting
power of Infinitude, I am trying to convey the idea that
Infinitude-ness is
everywhere, which is not, I think, as much
of a truism as it
appears. Within what may be called
limitless contraction there is Infinitude, no less than within
the limitless expansion with which we are much more
accustomed to associate the idea of Infinitude. In that
Ceaseless Breath of God to which reference is made in the
Stanzas of Dzyan, we conceive of an Infinitude of outbreath-
ing and equally of an Infinitude of inbreathing. Indeed the
very word God is a formula for some sort of Infinitude-Self-
Consciousness.
The Point conception has the advantage, as it were, of
localizing Infinitude, thereby enabling us to enter more
effectively into the spirit of it, since we ourselves are very
much creatures of locality. It is easier for us to conceive
of Infinitude in terms of apparent limitation, even though
the very phrase involves a contradiction in terms. Indeed,
the very contradiction stimulates comprehensibility, for
contradictions are our meat and drink, we live in the very
midst of them.

So the Point remains the most convenient expression
of an Infinitude.
1
It
represents that limitless contraction
which is the reverse process of limitless expansion. Limit-
less expansion is
outbreathing. Limitless contraction is
inbreathing.
I have said that Infinitude dwells within the least dif-
ferentiated particle of evolving consciousness. I wish to
convey that, at every stage of the evolutionary process,
and in every particle of consciousness, there is an Infini-
tude-ness which is the reflection of a Perfection -to- be. It is
what I should like to call Absolute Perfection, in the sense that
it is
perfect where it is, it is
relatively absolutely perfect I
offer no apology for the juxtaposition of these adverbs it
represents a complete mode of Perfection. The evolutionary
process fulfils its nature, fulfils itself, at every stage in every
least particle of its consciousness. The evolutionary process is
succeeding all the time, is
attaining a goal all the time, even
though it be not attaining the Goal. We may therefore
speak of every distinct moment of evolution as containing
within itself an Absolute Perfection, though this Perfection is
undoubtedly only relative when we compare it with that
which has yet to unfold. Indeed, I think that such sense
of Absoluteness as it is at all
possible for us to conceive
depends upon the establishment of a static condition of
consciousness. We can conceive of an Absolute when we
contemplate a " still
"
of the evolutionary moving picture.
When movement takes place, the Absoluteness disappears.
Therefore do I
say that for us, at our present stage,
it is the relative which is dynamic, and that our conception

as also lightning and the stars, and whatever else exist in this (universe), as
well as what do not all exist within this point of Akasha.'' Chhandogya
Upanishad.
18
274 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT

of the absolute must ever be associated with the static. I
know full well that this statement is
inherently wrong, but
perhaps its
very expression of a contradiction may convey
to us some dim sense of over-thoughts beyond our normal
powers of thinking.
I conceive of an Absolute Perfection in connection
with the Consummation aspect of the Point, and an Ab-
solute Perfection not merely with regard to the Point as a
whole, but also with regard to every constituent element of
that whole. To put this idea somewhat more plainly, I
conceive of a God as being not only perfect in His whole-
ness, but also as having perfect constituent elements built
into every aspect of His consciousness. The least particle
of a God is perfect at its stage, so that the substances
composing Him may be looked upon as a series of innumer-
able Perfections. Of course, there is a Perfection in each
one of us, in every living creature, when we look at a
certain achieved level of growth. But the pure Divinity
aspect only manifests in every part of being when the in-
dividual himself achieves Divinity.
When we look at the Point in its Consummation
aspect, we are looking at it as a static state, though in fact
it is, of course, dynamic, for not only is it
evolving on its
own plane of consciousness, but it is also moving to the
Forthgoing. It has its higher dynamic in its own growth
at its own level. It has its lower dynamic in the
Forthgoing.
I find myself wondering how I am able to associate
the static with the Consummation. I think the illusion is
produced through a slowing-down of Time-Movement to
imperceptibility, so that Time enters into a condition of
extreme intensity. The phrase occurs to me that the
Expansion-Infinitude of Eternity becomes reversed, or
transmuted, or modified, into the Contraction-Infinitude of
Time. Here again, while the idea seems confusing, I
THE YOGA OF INFINITUDES 275
Concentrated

Time
A Call of
Absolute to
Absolute
venture to think it is
suggestive of an over-thought beyond
the peaks of our thinking. But I must not leave the reader
with the idea that Time alone can thus deepen into intens-
ity. Eternity speeded up if the expression is at all
intelligible becomes no less Infinitude-intense than Time
when slowed down. Is the intensity of Eternity the
intensity of Time turned inside-out ? In any case it is an
intensity of outbreathing as contrasted with an intensity of
inbreathing.
I seem to , the Point in an illusion of its
being, a
concentrated essence of Time. It is the gathering together
of all the time that has been used to produce it. It is a
mode of Eternity, but it is not Eternity. And we make an
effective pretence of its
being some kind of a
"
still/' just
as we might at a particular point stop dead a motion-
picture reel, so that we may give ourselves the impression
of looking upon something which is in the nature of an
Absolute. Stopping a sequence of relatives, we gain a
sense of an Absolute. Perhaps this idea may suggest to
us a tremendous thought-vista in the idea of Movement as
consisting of a multitude of sequential Absolutes. Does
the Absolute theme run through the whole of a rela-
tivity series ?
In the light of all this, I
postulate the thought that
the Forthgoing aspect of the Point is a Call which is com-
posed of Absolutes. It is a Call from Perfection, which is
static, to unconsciousness which is also static. On the
other hand, we may regard this aspect of the Point as dy-
namic, contrasting it with the Consummation, because while
it
may be composed of that which is static, it is a Call, and
a Call must ever be composed of Movement. Because of
the Call, apart from its nature, the static unconsciousness
of the " Men of the Sea
"
of undifferentiation is changed
into the beginnings of dynamic consciousness as they hear
the Call and awaken.

Let it be further said that this Call is not alone to the
denizens, or rather to some of the denizens of the Sea of
Undifferentiation. It is no less a Call to itself as Point, to
prepare the evolutionary way of those who are on the
threshold of being active Gods-in-the-becoming, so that
their path may be made straight.
'
Thus is the Call twofold.
Therefore, those whom we may call the
" Men of the
Point
"
awaken, and the Point itself awakens in itself the
mighty function of Father-Motherhood.
The Web that is the Womb flashes forth. And we
see in this very flashing that its form is, as are all forms,
predetermined. This Web that is the Womb is a very
marvellous reflection of that Infinite Web that is the Infinite
Womb. We thus at once come to the conclusion that all
symbols, however much we may bestow upon them the
title of "
Ultimates," are part reflections, perhaps, of reflec-
tions, and 'of Absolute Symbols, if such there be. Or shall
I
say that every finite symbol and all the symbols of Sym-
bolic Yoga must be deemed to be finite in a certain sense
of the word is a reflection of an Infinite Symbol, from
which there descends an infinite series of symbols, con-
tracting from Infinitude into the most microscopic individ-
uality of which we can conceive ? Every individuality is a
Symbol, is a Formula, is a Mnemonic, is an Act of Remem-
brance. It is for this reason that we may so rightly speak
of the Yoga of Remembrance. I have used the word
14
Ultimate
"
in connection with the symbols I describe.
Obviously I cannot mean that these symbols are absolutely
ultimate but only relatively ultimate ultimate within a
certain universe of understanding.
This Web that is the Womb brings forth, as child, the
vertical Line. I have said that this Line stretches out into
Infinitude, Yet with all its curvature into Infinitude it must
be remarked that it
expresses a limitation a limitation of
expansion and a limitation of contraction. The Line is a
THE YOGA OF INFINITUDES 277

These Symbols

Otherwise
Divine Standard, a Yard Measure, and it measures. Perhaps
I
ought to have said that it measures rather than it is
limited. Its measurement-function gives an idea that it is
limited. But in reality it
may have no limitation, but only
be exercising a faculty when it measures for the evo-
lutionary process with which I am associating it.
" With
which I am associating it," yes. For how do I know that
there is in fact an actual giving birth to a Line ? May it not
well be that the Web that is the Womb is
giving birth not
to a Line as such, but to a quality of the Line which is the
Line for all
evolutionary processes, which is the Universal
Yard-Stick raying forth individual aspects to suit individual
evolutionary processes ? It
may not matter which idea is
nearer the truth. But these meditations are part and
parcel of dynamic Yoga, for the true Yogi penetrates and
penetrates and penetrates, and does not care much whither
he is
going so long as he is
going.
In any case the Line is the justification for the Circle,
though how this is drawn I do not know, since it flashes
into being without the slightest indication as to any process.
Of course, the Divine Compasses take into account the
Point, start from it, for it is the Point which determines the
Circle even more than the Line itself. Some day our
mathematicians may be able to tell us exactly how much
more important the centre of the circle is even than that
other point which gives us the half-diameter stretch.
I find myself thinking about the expansion and con-
traction Infinitudes in relation to all these symbols. In the
case of the Point we have what I can only call a Contrac-
tion-Infinitude, which is
camouflaged for us in a Point
presentation. We must by no means think that the symbol
could not be presented otherwise than as a Point, or indeed
that any of the symbols could not be presented otherwise
than they are. The presentation of each symbol is a con-
venience, though none the less a truth. On the other
278 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
hand, I am not suggesting that they do not have a real
existence, independent of this particular conception of
them, nor must I
say that each one is not an accurate
reflection of its Reality. It is
very difficult in these most
distant regions of consciousness to be at all positive as
regards forms, and to say that one form is true and that
another form is false. I know perfectly well that the forms
whereby I have described the various symbols are true
forms ; but I must not say that they are the only forms.
I have described the Consummation-Forthgoing in terms
of a Point. I could have described it in terms of an
Expansion-Infinitude. I have described the Web that
is the Womb as a scintillating network, perhaps as I am
noxv seeing it in semi-ovoid form. But I
by no means
feel restricted to this particular description. I see, for
example, other forms the welling up of a fountain, a
long half-opened lily-like chalice of force-petals of iri-
descent light, heaven-turned, resembling the conventional
lotus form which arises out of old Egyptian pillars, which one
sees reproduced in many beautiful flower-vases made today.
I
speak about a Point when perhaps I should rather
speak about a Potency. I
speak about a Line when perhaps
I should speak about a myriad Lines which themselves
establish a Circle at their extremities. The Point radiates and
there are Lines. The Lines revolve and there is the Circle.
The Line could well be described as an infinite Circle,
while the Circle itself could have flashed into existence at
once as a Globe. But I have described the symbols as I
saw them when disclosed to me by my Teacher. I am only
touching upon the possibility of other descriptions in order
that the reader may not feel himself in any way tied down
to the specific forms which were the first to come to me.
' n any case> we must ac' m' t ^at everY symbol only
tells half the story of itself, for it has to be a Contraction-
Infinitude rather than an Expansion-Infinitude, or we should
THE YOGA OF INFINITUDES 279

not understand it at all. There is no contraction which has
not its expansion aspect, no infinitely-small which has not
its
infinitely-large, no movement, or colour, or form, or
sound, which has not its infinite counterpart, its corre-
sponding Expansion-Infinitude, assuming that each represents
the contraction aspect, So are we compelled to play with
contradictions, but we are safe if we know that they are
contradictions and only tell, at the most, half the story of
their being. Let us be clear that there is no Infinitude in
one direction which has not its
counterpart in an equal and
opposite direction.
I have written of the curvature of the Line, and
I have also referred during the course of the book to
curvature as inherent in all forms. I think that this
universal existence of curvature has its root in the truth
of Universal Relationship, outside which there is
nothing.
Such Relationship, in some wonderful way, demands curva-
ture. In very microcosmic terms we speak of Reverence.
Reverence is curvature in its
very essence. So, in fact, are
also Goodwill and Compassion the three being the essen-
tial qualities of curvature. The very curvature of Light is
its
expression of Reverence, though we shall have to define
Reverence very much more acutely and accurately if we are
to use the word for the macrocosmic as well as for the
microcosmic. I think I must leave this fascinating problem
at this point, or I shall be entering regions in which I cannot
at my stage of evolution have any bearings.
I see that I can call each symbol a Point, as from one
aspect each undoubtedly is. But I do not do so, because
there are other terms available for the understanding of the
symbols. For example, the Web that is the Womb has
very much kinship with the emotion-ideas and thought-ideas
which constitute our stock-in-trade for the process of
adjustment which our incarnation into the outer world in-
volves. This symbol can be easily expressed in terms with
280 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT

Cross ?
which we are familiar, in terms of which we have quite a
definite conception in the birth and growth of the embryo.
1
But the Web that is the Womb has its Infinitudes no less
than the Point. And equally its curvature. Had it not
these qualities, the Line could not possess the quality of
Infinitude or of Curvature.
In the case of the Line, its Point idea will certainly be
familiar to students of mathematics, for, as I conceive it, the
Line is indeed a series of Points. And what is not a series
of Points ? I have already suggested that each symbol is
from one point of view a Point.
The Circle may perhaps be described as a quality of
the Line, or as the outward and visible sign of the Universal
Line in a mode of its limitation. The Circle is the child of
the Line, but it is also a mode of the Line, for I find my-
self conceiving of the Line in its
principle of curvature as
an infinite Circle, of which the Circle symbol is a mode of
expression incarnation, if you will. The Circle, too, has
its Infinitudes which may be studied with very great profit.
One especially notices that the Circle lays down the Law.
Of course, all the symbols lay down the Law. They are
embodied Law, because they are embodied Life and
embodied Light. We perhaps rightly call the Circle a
Ring-Pass-Not, and think of the Circle as symbolizing a
special application of the Law-Universal to a universe in
particular.
We now come to that most interesting and in many
ways perplexing symbol, the Cross, which flashes into being
by the appearance of a horizontal Line which bisects the
vertical Line. As I look upon the Cross in the light of
the experience I have gained, I find myself irresistibly
coming to the conclusion that all I have said about it is
indeed inadequate. And I find nowhere any explanation
or definition which satisfies my present vision of it.

An Infinite Soul

The Lines have

Extension
What is the Cross ? It is, of course, the negation of
undifferentiation. It is an Infinitude in incarnation. It is
a soul-body. The vertical Line symbolizes Infinitude. The
horizontal Line typifies Limitation. You will perhaps tell
me that I have described the vertical Line as a Divine
Measure, a Yard-Stick, a very expression of Limitation. Such
indeed it is. But the horizontal Line might no less be
described as an Infinitude. It is. It curves into infinity on
its own plane just as the vertical Line curves into infinity on
its own plane. Yet, while the vertical Line stands for a
definite limitation, declaring where the new evolutionary
process ends, both as to its North and as to its South, it
asserts the Infinitude idea, the Infinitude element in life.
The horizontal Line, while expressing Infinitude, puts on
the garb of limitation, and we seem to perceive it far more
in terms of limitation than the vertical Line. Both are the
same, though on different planes. But one, while ex-
pressing Limitation, intimates Infinitude. The other, while
expressing Infinitude, intimates Limitation. I am afraid
this is very metaphysical, but it is all I can truly perceive
with regard to the Cross. The vertical Line descends into
the horizontal Line as an infinite soul enters a limited
body. The Cross is thus the incarnated soul, and in the
Svastika we have the symbol of its
growth.
Both the vertical Line and the horizontal Line must
be conceived of as extending infinitely beyond the
Circle-Globe, and yet while the conception is
easy so
far as regards the vertical Line, and both necessary and
right, we cannot help perceiving that the horizontal
Line permits itself to be definitely Circle-Globe limited.
The vertical Line attends to the Circle-Globe but lives in
the outer regions far more. The horizontal Line, though
also living in the outer regions, seems, as it were, to
take up its abode in the Circle-Globe and to dwell
therein.
282 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
The Magnetisms | a lso see this horizontal Line as performing a kind

of dual function. It is the East-to-West diameter just
as the vertical Line is the North-to-South diameter, but
the horizontal Line is also in some strange way that I find
difficult to understand, the Equator, and an Equator which
in some way separates the Northern Hemisphere from the
Southern so distinctly that it is almost impossible not to feel
that they are different worlds even though they belong to
the same world. 2 I wish I had the knowledge to understand
how this equatorial division affects the whole of the life
on the one side and on the other. I am afraid to specu-
late lest my imagination or may I
say my intuition runs
away with me. But it occurs to me that there are periods
of northern evolution, of southern evolution, of eastern
evolution, and of western evolution, and that each kind of
evolution differs from all the other kinds in that each is
affected by different types of magnetisms. Certainly this
seems abundantly true as regards the North and the South,
for even the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms seem
definitely affected by the differences of the two magnet-
isms.'
5
I think the same may be postulated to be true with
regard to the human kingdom. There is a different mode
of evolution in the North from that which there is in the
South, but we have yet to understand its nature. In any
case, we see at once that the horizontal Line is a very
potent factor in the evolutionary process, and may be
rightly regarded as representing the Mother principle, just as
the vertical Line may be rightly regarded as representing
the Father principle.

think, no further comment, nor

This pull of the vertical and horizontal was felt by the poet Gabrielle

felt that he wanted to live vertically.

say, as the very title of this book suggests, that while from
one point of view the Point is a common principle inherent
in all
symbols, the Lotus and its Fire constituent is indeed
no less inherent. In one way, the Point is the Alpha of
the process, while the Lotus is the Omega.

more easily through postures such as are recommended in
many books dealing with other forms of Yoga ?
There are but two postures which at present I wish
to associate with this form of Yoga, at all events until the
student has penetrated far. One, the sitting posture,
cross-legged, as indicated in the Hindu Scriptures, or in a
position of relaxed ease as, for example, in a chair. The
other is a posture of standing, the posture of a Line, of

easier, but for deeper penetration the other, which is a
standing posture, is far better.
When an individual, a Man, reaches the human king-

passes its pons asinorum or middle point, and enters
the last stages in that kingdom, becoming ready for con-

Heaven, and from his South the Fire of Earth. So doipg,
he reflects the third great symbol of this form of Yoga, the
Line, the forthpouring of the Third Logos in fecundation of
the as yet Sea of the Unmanifest. But the Line position
may be used for action in connection with each of the
symbols. Indeed, it is the primordial posture in this form
of Yoga.
The moment you look at an individual with the two
circles he forms, at either end of the Line one formed by
the head and the breast, and the other by the feet in
that moment you see the beginnings or shadow of a Rod
of Power,
1
to be perfected only after an incalculable
period of time. And this is but a reflection of the circle
of his Heaven-consciousness and the circle of his Earth-
consciousness united in his individuality, again the Cosmic
Rod of Power.
The spine is the best reflection we have of this Rod
of Power, though in its upright nature it is not so well
reflected in the lower kingdoms of nature. The spine is
our Rod of Power, rather perhaps the esoteric than the
exoteric spine. To the inner spine belong the Ida and
Pingala and the Kundalini Fire.

If
you will go as high as
you cdh go, you will perceive that the spine is but the
putting into perspective of a portion of the infinite Line
of individuality, of your own individuality. The physical
spine is
your Rod of Power during your few years of life.
There is another spine and that is a projection from your
infinite curvature. I cannot follow it, but see that it is so.
In meditation you may sit or stand at ease, but your spine
must be as straight as you conveniently can make it without
discomfort.
A certain erectness, if
you are able to achieve it, lifts
you entirely out of all the sordidness of earth, and yet

keeps you in touch with the Mother Spirit of Earth, so that
it is almost as if
you are a child between the Father, who
is the Sun, and the Mother, who is the Earth. You are
literally a live wire between heaven and earth, between the
heaven of your future and the earth of your present
and past.
Man in his highest spiritual reaches, as he approaches
the Way of Holiness
*
and treads it
successfully, turning his
face homeward, is in some way the middle point of the
evolutionary process. Beyond him stretches the great Way
of Return. Beneath him stretches the great Way of Forth -
going. He is a middle point in the great curvature of growth,
not its consummation, but the link between the two Ways.
The achievement of the human kingdom gives him his first
safety, even though the Crown of Victory is not assured to
him until he achieves the second safety entry into the Law-
consciousness of Life or, as we sometimes call it, Initiation.
But let it be said that he has been safe for ever, from
the very beginning, even though we may think of him now
as more safe than ever.
Man as man stands upright in the beginnings of Self-
consciousness, as does no other aspect of his individuality.
Thus standing, through the marriage of the Fires, the
aspirant lifts his lower consciousness into the higher, and
causes his higher consciousness to flood the lower and
less by slow effort, as set forth in the ordinary books on
Yoga, more by the resolution of a quick and magic will.
He will stand erect, stilled from all outer contacts, yet
potent with them all, arms loosely hanging down and close
to the body, feet together, head absolutely erect. He will
stand lightly, with as little sense of weight as possible, the
breathing even, regular, deep, but, above all, natural,
unhurried.

with the
Elements
The Use of the
Postures
The student should, as far as he can, think of himself
as a single whole, stand with the whole of himself, breathe
with the whole of himself, in a spirit of movementless poise.
But again I insist upon perfect relaxation, so that if a seated
posture is more comfortable, it
may be adopted. But there
must, of course, be no lounging or sprawling, The student
must sit upright.
Surroundings must melt away. The eyes should see
into vague far-off distances, through all
intervening objects.
And the more the student is able to lose himself in an
undefined larger consciousness, in a consciousness entirely
unfurnished save by vibrations of space, the more will he
be able to identify himself with one symbol of Yoga after
another.
Thus established in as perfect a rhythm as he is able
to achieve at his particular stage of evolution, this Yogi-
in-the-becoming may try to identify himself with symbol
after symbol as may be expedient, or he may remain poised
in a particular symbol, changing himself, transmuting him-
self, into the essence of the symbol, seeking in a spirit of
perfect imperturbability and quiet will to become one with
it, pouring it forth, as it were, through the nucleus that is
his individuality.
He drenches himself with the earth, air, fire and water
of the symbol, and with their inner counterparts, and then
causes these to flow through him either to a particular
place, or throughout the world. Or he may cause the
symbol to go before him as an oriflamme, as a star, so that
in the process of the progress the symbol-oriflamme, the
symbol-star, may effect on its way an adjustment to the
Real.
The sitting posture may be suitable for what is to be
no more than if I
may use this utterly improper suggestion
a consciousness identification with one of these cosmic
Ultimates. But where such identification is to be followed
288 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
invocations
through Form,
Colour, Sound
Majesties of
Sound
by an extension of the act of Yoga, it is better to begin
from the beginning with the standing posture. There are
a number of aids to the truer performance of this Yoga,
the nature of which depends opon the particular form of
rhythm to which the individual is attuned.
The form-Yogi may be immensely helped by the
invocation of particular form-rhythms appealing deeply and
strongly to him. The colour-Yogi may be immensely
helped by the invocation of particular colour-rhythms. The
sound-Yogi to which company I
belong at its lowest levels
will equally be immensely helped by the invocation of
sounds which he will send vibrating through his conscious-
ness at all its various levels.
Indeed, I associate with each symbol a special music-
motif. I associate, for example, the wonderful principal
motif in Schubert's
"
Unfinished Symphony
"
with the Line
symbol. I associate with the Point, in its cosmic hush of poise
between the Consummation and the Forthgoing, the Prelude
to Act 1 of Wagner's
"
Lohengrin."
Thus, in performing acts of Yoga in connection with
one or another of the symbols, I call to my aid the great
majesties of sound which I
happen to associate with them,
and so intensify the purity of my meditation. And I also
try to beg the aid of those mighty Masters of Sound, the
Gandharvas, the Angels of Music, who sing and otherwise
send forth in glorious sound the evolution-motif of each
individuality in every kingdom of nature. They do more
than this, of course. They sing the song of every expansion
of consciousness as it takes place in every life, and they
supply as it were a running commentary on each Individual-
ity's upward climbing to his Divinity remembering his
past, recording his present, and bringing to this very
present the most marvellous sound-intimations of his
Divinity-to-be. Most beautiful is it to hear how out of the
sound-pattern for the moment being woven these Masters

of Sound draw the threads which shall at long last be
woven into the pattern of a God.
It is, of course, the same with forms and colours.
The principle is identical, though the material is different.
And the student of this form of Yoga must seek out his
Eternal Self and call upon it
(or should I
say upon Him-Her)
to give the cosmic sweep of its
mighty form, the gorgeous
aurora of its rainbow colours, the glorious notes of its
music-heaven.
Thus atmosphered, thus keyed in perfect attunement
to his eternal reality, the student may well hope to perform
in true synchronization his act of union his Yoga with
one or more of the cosmic Ultimates which this form of
Yoga invokes into these regions of time.
I have purposely left vague the actual technique of
such acts of union, for this is
very much a matter for each
individual student to develop for himself. I have hinted at
the principle, and I have given just a suggestion as to my
own individual way of going about this particular aspect of
the work. On the whole, only hints should be given, for
this form of Yoga is a mode of Self-expression, and the
Self-expression of one must not be the Self-expression of
another.
I shall, however, be very glad to receive from students
brief descriptions of their experiences, with special reference
to any colour, form or sound associations. I am also very
specially anxious to receive from Hindu and Mussalman
students any comments on their own experiences with their
own great musics.

THE "MAN" HIERARCHY
I think I
ought to make clear that I am only concerned with
the
" Man
"
aspect of the particular form of Yoga disclosed to me
in some small measure by the Lord of Yoga who so graciously
helped.
290 SYMBOLS LIVING AND RADIANT
The Life, represented by the symbols I have been trying to
describe, is
inconceivably complicated, dealing with almost in-
numerable orders or hierarchies of lives. The "
Man
"
hierarchy
is
only one among them, and both the Consummation and the
Forthgoing of an evolutionary process involve streams of force
nfinitely complex in themselves and no less complex in their
relationships with one another, to say nothing of their links with
other evolutionary processes altogether
It must not be assumed for a moment that, because I have
emphasized the "
Man
"
hierarchy, therefore there is no other of
any importance associated with the evolutionary process. The
contrary is true. But it was my duty to bring into perspective
the human evolution on this earth, here and now, and to focus
attention on that aspect of Symbolic Yoga which specially concerns
the
"
Men
"
of the evolutionary process.
Stirring to From the beginning, therefore, it has appeared that the
^j?
s<-' ous whole objective of the Forthgoing was to stir
"
Men
"
to their
dment
conscious unfoldment, and I caused the Sea of the Unconscious to
seem exclusively peopled with
"
Men," there also apparently being
naught but the Call of the All-One to cause the stream of
"
Men
"
to flow.
I should also add that I have made no reference to the
successive waves of the evolutionary process which fill one kingdom
of nature after another and so produce succession in the evolution-
ary process, establish a ladder on each rung of which are evolving
Men. Here again, to avoid complexity, I have written as if there
were but one awakening of Men of the Sea out of the Undif-
ferentiated, and that these Men constitute the whole of the
evolutionary process.
The Call goes forth, and wave after wave of response enters
within the Circle and moves successively upon the Way
Again, as all students of Theosophy know, the setting in
motion of the Wheel of Evolution involves the co-operation of
innumerable Beings of ail types, from the smallest atom creatures
to the mighty Devas and other Rulers of worlds, from the dwellers
in earth, air, fire and water, and in all other elements, up to the
Logos of a solar system, and beyond.
Were I to have attempted to weave all these strands into
my picture, I should have entirely frustrated the object of the Lord
of Yoga in trying to convey to me this small fragment of His
mighty Science.
So I have removed from practically all its adjuncts the
"
Man
"
cross-section of the evolutionary process, isolating it from
its setting, so as to concentrate the student on the actual working
of the Yoga in relation to Man.

As a lamp in a windless place flickereth not, to such is

seeking Yoga, action is called the
means ; for the same Sage, when he is enthroned in Yoga, serenity
is called the means. The Bhagavad-Gita, VI, 3, 19
On one occasion, watching the Teacher, who has
been trying to impress upon me somewhat of this mighty
form of Yoga, I saw Him standing and looking out from His
home across the vast spaces of the Himalayas, ridge upon
ridge of these mighty kings of the mineral kingdom stretch-
ing backwards into unfathomable distances.
He was perfectly still ; His state of vibrant ease seemed
to compel the homage of His surroundings, and tune them
to the peace which was theirs to enjoy.
He seemed poised as a runner is
poised, waiting the
signal for the race.
A Perfect Man was set in perfect surroundings. Into
His surroundings He blended, and into Him His surroundings
were as if drawn by the magic of the Unity of Life.
Outwards He breathed His Kingship, and in all life
around Him it found thrones. Inwards He breathed His
Kingship, and in Him all life infinitely far round Him found
refuge, peace and a Godhead. I am afraid I am very crudely
expressing this mystery of a higher consciousness. I can only
say that He was in all things, and all
things were in Him.

showing me some of those elements of the Science which

And since He, a Nataraja, an Orpheus,
*
a Lord of
Movement was performing a Yoga, the whole world thrilled.
In each living thing the Song of Life sends forth
its notes of joyous unfoldment : in the murmuring of the
stirring sea of Life awakening enriched and glorified by the
Voice of God ; in the melodious chantings of mountains,
hills, seas, rivers, rocks, plains and precious stones ; in the
first vague intimations of some individual song in trees, in
flowers, in fields of corn and rice, in grass ; the chanting
unfolding to stronger purpose, in clearer song, in creatures
of the kingdom next above, the animal the chanting thus
gaining further power and moving to clearer purpose in
the animal kingdom ; and then the Song of Life at last
emerging, halting but recognizable yet halting only to
the outep ear, true reflection to the inner into human
individuality. The human kingdom is reached, and in its
higher regions we hear from every denizen a veritable
Song of Life blending into the Chant of Life's approaching
triumph.

We know our lives and growth in terms of bodies
and of space and time. But our lives are lived no less in
terms of sound and colour. We can hear life grow in
terms of music. We can see life grow in terms of colour.
We can hear a singing which little by little unfolds into the
perfect melody, containing within itself all other sweetness
of sound. We can see a rainbow little

shaping
itself into a perfect sequence of colours, containing within
itself all other sweetness of light.

Each Symbol is

Thus was it when my Teacher caused a mighty Yoga
to flood His being. The whole world thrilled. Each
living thing sang as it had never sung before. Each living
thing arrayed itself in colour-light it had never worn be-
fore. Performing an act of Yoga, He brought gladness to
all life in all the worlds.
Such was His magic. How infinitely less must needs
be ours. Yet must we begin, for He too began !
And while I revelled in the gladness, myself rejoicing,
I saw that my own joy and the joy of all that lived came
from His wondrous stillness. His background was of
Silence and of Darkness, but of a Silence and a Darkness
of which I knew I could have no conception. It was in the
midst of such a setting that His Sound and Light flashed
forth in symbol after symbol, and the relation between the
setting and the jewels of His forthgoing was itself a vision
of inconceivable majesty.
At last the Man of the Forthgoing and the God of the
Consummation had become one, at least to all vision
within my power to command ; though I knew that even
He had not attained that final Consummation of which the
symbol in this form of Yoga is the Point, the Majesty of
Man Self-conscious in His Godhead.
So by this act of Yoga He fulfilled in Himself each
symbol He used, and caused it to glow in all life. He
released for each Man-wanderer, travelling to his Godhead,
a great Act of Remembrance, the memory that he is God
and naught but God. Each symbol is indeed an Act of
Remembrance, and together they give not just memory,
but Divinity.
A WARNING
I feel I
ought to offer a word of apology as the reader
enters upon these most difficult chapters of Books Three
and Four. Indeed, I have more than once thought I should
be better advised to drop them altogether as being in the
nature of most immature investigation in which there will
be much more wrong than right. On the other hand,
even the gropings of a tyro, such as I
certainly am, may
have some value, as much in what may be wrong as in that
which may be right.
I have made a sketch of certain sublimities, and the
sketch is feeble. But it remains a sketch, and may be
suggestive. It ^may evoke certain lines of thought in the
field it sketches, and it
may bring the reader, in its very
inadequacy, into contact with lines of force with which he
may be far better able to deal, which he may be far better
able to understand, and therefore to manipulate.
In these forthcoming chapters I am out of my depth
more, I think, than elsewhere. But I have allowed them to
appear, for it is, perhaps, better to wade in and to find
oneself out of one's depth than never to wade in at all.
I
definitely believe that there is some positive truth in what
I have experienced and described. It is for each reader to
wade in for himself and to find where he, too, is out of his
depth. It
may not be the depth which is too deep for me.
He may find his feet in it. So much the better. But
there will probably be some other depth which will be too
deep for him. Perhaps there may come an occasion for
us to pool our wadings, and more truly to chart at least a
portion of these depths.
Book Three Symbols Released
and Dynamic
SYNOPSIS OF BOOK THREE
Chapter 1
THE LOTUS FIRE
The purpose of subfimation of state after state of consciousness,
the purpose of symbol after symbol in this form of Yoga, is to enable
the student step by step to gain a real glimpse of that sublime Trinity-
in-One of Seed-bud-flower the Lotus Fire, the Earth-Heaven which is
Man, which is God, which is Logos.
Chapter 2
YOGA FOR THE MAN IN THE WORLD
An individual may perform his Yoga in any centre of himself, and in
any aspect of himself, and in any place. But there are also places
outside the individual which are very powerful aids to the right perform-
ance of Yoga. Symbolic Yoga is for the man and the woman in the
world, but not for the man and woman of the world. And in the world
of Yoga, Truth is sought that it may be shared with others.
Chapter 3
THE YOGA OF ENFOLDMENT
God is Life-Giver. And you cannot know your Self save as you
give life. You cannot enter into the spirit of any of the symbols of this
form of Yoga save as you give forth the life you have achieved. This
is called the Yoga of Enfoldment, for the heart of this Symbolic Yoga is
its insistence on the essential unity of life.
Chapter 4
THE YOGA OF RECEPTIVITY
What is your ray, your colour, your note ? With such self-discovery
the Yogi is able to send forth his own nature more effectively. He
associates with each symbol certain virtues, and strengthens them. He
sends forth his Yoga through loved ones and cherished things of his own
circle, and fortifies it with splendours from other kingdoms or circles.
'
298 SYMBOLS RELEASED AND DYNAMIC
Each symbol glows with the spirit of Universal Motherhood, and in every
kingdom of nature he sees the holiness of motherhood. He studies the
great Yogas of life in every kingdom of nature, and helps all to fulfil
their own Yoga. In a word, he walks discreetly and reverently amid all
forms of life, and around him spreads peace. The student must begin
to live such a life, and pursue it even though he must often fail.
Chapter 5
THE YOGA OF ART
Art is one of the supreme forms of revelation. Where art is great
it hints at the larger states beyond the present form of its embodiment.
The true artist seeks and disdains to achieve. Modern art must be
judged by the nature of the artist. Bohemianism is not art. The artist
must pay for touching the heights by contacting the depths ; he swings
between virtues and weaknesses. But he must ever remember that
graciousness is an essential attribute of art, and graciousness includes
reverence, devotion and sacrifice. Art is wherever the holiness and
glory of God, of Nature, of Life, are made manifest to man through
sound, colour or form ; so all are artists and pnests-in-the-becoming of
holiness and glory. But for the dedicated artist there is a special Yoga
of Art. There is a single theme on which the universe is based. Only a
master-artist can give even the feeblest echo of such a theme. For
the student-artist there is a posture to practice, which resolves ignorance
into wisdom, and expands the individualization of Yoga.

The symbols suggest an octave of non-earthly colours .

flashes of green, rose-red, rainbow, lightning-white and this octave forms

emerald, ruby, unknown gem, no-stone. Seek out the octave-circle of
the seven sounds. I often see in people around me the colours of their
jewel-glories, I hear the sounds of their growing, and I
perceive the
building of their forms. I see their Suns within them drops of glory
from our Lord the Sun,
Chapter 7
COLOUR-TONE IN DAILY YOGA
A green thought-form may always be safely used to help an
individual or a cause. But each day has its individual colour. So the
use of a colour on the day to which that colour belongs will intensify the
.strength and purity of the colour, and possibly link it to extra-terrestrial
forces. Each day has also its note and its form.
SYNOPSIS 299
Chapter 8
THE COLOUR-RAGA OF AN ALPHABET
The symbols are for use, and not to be just looked at. The student
must learn to harness the spirit of the symbols to a number of modes
of self-expression in terms of colour and sound and form. For life is so
much these three. By learning to associate certain colours and sounds
and forms with the letters of an alphabet, we may release the powers of
healing and harmonizing.
Chapter 9
AUM : THE FORMULA OF THE ALL-ONE
The Point is the one-syllabled Aum, the formula of the All-One.
But this one-syllabled Aum unfolds into three syllables in the Web, and
thence in the Line, at which stage we begin to hear that other formula :
Aum Mam Padme Hum. This formula of Forthgoing runs like a
wondrous thread through the seven symbols.
Chapter 10
A YOGA IN SOUND
This piece of music was sketched for my own use, to help to
bridge the gulf between an inner and an outer Yoga. Each student
should, of course, build his own music bridge with the material of his
own uniqueness. There are innumerable bridges. A Yoga in Sound
is one of them.
Chapter 1 1
A MASTER-CHANNEL OF MUSIC
I see a splendid orchestra. It is
being conducted by a great
musician, and some of the most gorgeous music, relayed from the
Heaven of Music through a master-channel is
being played. The music
will thrill into symbol-form after symbol-form, and thrill through the
worlds, helping to make a heaven of earth. Listening to it, I
may even
pass beyond symbol, and find a Peace in which the river of my being
disappears into the ocean of Reality.
Chapter 12
THE COSMIC DRUMS
1 have heard one or two notes of the Cosmic Drums, the beginning
of ail things. And they are rolling, beating, vibrating all the time with-
in you no less than outside you. While always maintaining the eternal roll,
300 SYMBOLS RELEASED AND DYNAMIC
that roll varies subtly according to the needs of the world. The Cosmic
Drums are impersonal, all-permeating, silent, with elements of resistless
power and immanent compassion. We may hear them if we first learn
to be silent, and then try to hear with impersonality, with imagination,
with our Self. Later we may become their channels to help the world.
Chapter 13
THE RHYTHMS OF MAN
The laws of Nature are laws or rhythms of Man. The seven primary
rhythms are : the Rhythm of Existence, the Rhythm of Unity, the
Rhythm of Universality, the Rhythm of Hierarchy, the Rhythm of Move-
ment, the Rhythm of Difference, the Rhythm of Self-containedness. In
other words, life is ; life is one ; life is everywhere ; life is a ladder ;
life is movement ; each life is
unique ; God is
everywhere and every
one. Besides these primary seven, there are other rhythms.

Radhakrishnan
As you concentrate on this Lotus symbol, growing from the
soil of experience, ascending to its flower, imagine yourself as a
great White Lotus with petal-powers extending in all directions.
Already the seed is in you, the bud is
slowly opening, and you are
beginning the Flower, the dream that God has wrought.
Let me now state what I seem to have perceived with
such senses as Yoga may have additionally bestowed upon
me that the Lotus Fire is Seed, Bud and Flower in one, and
that inherent in it are its time and space, whatever these
terms may mean." They do mean something, or I should
not use them, .but as St. Augustine said in his Confessions :
What then is time ? If
nobody asks me, I know . . . but if
I
try to explain it to one who asks me, I do not know.
I have been wandering with you in these highly un-
charted regions; because I want to create in us all a specific
impression. I want that we should feel utterly lost and
confused, for we cannot embark upon any real understand-
ing of Yoga unless and until we deliberately cut ourselves
adrift from persons and principles, from books and dis-
courses, from authorities and experiences. We must be
alone in a tunnel of darkness, and see no light at either
end. Our preconceptions must be shattered. Our

But the purpose of all this iconoclasm is not to show
the valuelessness of all that has been ours. It is not to
show that our certainties, our preconceptions, our conven-

It is to show us that while we are Men we are no less
Gods, and that in the fullness, not of time, but of Eternity,
we shall Create, Nourish and Regenerate universes.
It is to show us that we have very far to go before we
learn to distinguish between the appearance-Realities, in which
for the most part we are content to live, and the Reality-
appearances, which we have yet to reach. We must not for
a moment imagine that because of our deep cherishing, an ap-
pearance is an ultimate Reality, that it is more than a dim, im-
perfectly reflecting facet, if that, of the diamond of the ReaL
There are many optical illusions to show that we
know little as to the relationship between appearance and
Reality, but I think we have to learn that all
appearances are
Realities and all Realities appearances. Every appearance
is a mode of the Real, and every Real is a mode of
appearance. Hence there is far less difference between
the two than "
appears."

illusion, which is an illusion of direction whereby
" a circular

gives the appearance of an actual chess-
board if the eyes be concentrated upon the centre.

trolled intervention of the human will

progress from appearance-Reality to Reality-appearance,
from imprisonment within forms to freedom in all forms,
which progress is caused by the will of man coming into
contact with the Will of God. The appearance of the symbols
may lead us to a Reality of Life. And I therefore feel that
the association of the symbols of this form of Yoga with
the human will in its various states of consciousness from
the physical inwards may have the effect of producing
valuable constructive adjustments, enabling me to gain some
small measure of entry into conditions of consciousness
ordinarily outside all penetration.
If I can rightly concentrate upon the Point, I
may gain
a conception of undifferentiated infinity, animated by the
Ceaseless Breath of God, of a Consummation and a Forth-
going in One. I
may adjust my various states of consciousness
to these ideas, and effect a quite extraordinary vivification,
so that in a sense the limited takes on the will-vesture in an
aspect of its relative limitlessness. The limited thus reflects
in truer measure its own Point of immeasurable infinitude.
If I can rightly concentrate upon the Web-Womb, I
may gain a conception of that Duality which proceeds out
of the Unity and is the setting of the archetypal creative
act, from which all other creative acts depend. I shall be
able to adjust my various states of consciousness so that in
each of them is reflected the Divine Duality in terms of their
respective vibratory rates.
If I can rightly concentrate upon the Line, I
may gain
a conception of the Divine Measure whereby I live and
move and have my whole being, and the heights to which
I can ascend, the depths below which I dare not, and in
some cases cannot, descend. Having established within
myself the Unity of the Point, the Duality of the Web-
Womb, and the Trinity of the Line, I incline my nature in its
threefold aspect to the Three Logoi, its Divine Prototypes.

If I can rightly concentrate upon the Circle, I
may
gain a conception of the mystery of the Diverse and the
Universe, so as to establish accurately that spirit of inter-
dependence, of interrelation, and of unity in diversity
which is in some incomprehensible way a fundamental law.
It is at this point that I
begin to realize that the Point
at which I have been looking is in no state of isolation, is
by no means just a Point all
by itself It has seemed to
me to be all
by itself because my attention exclusively con-
centrated upon it as a unity.
But the further concentration which the symbol of the
Circle-Globe affords, reveals to me that not only is the Point
but one of innumerable Points,
1
so that I
begin to flounder
in a maze of undifferentiated infinitudes, but that in its own
being it is
packed full of Points, of the nature of which I can
only surmise that they somehow form part of the Being of
the Point. Are they His capital, which He will in due course
partly invest in the contents of the Circle-Globe ? Are they
the stuff of His consciousness ? That they are cells in His
organism I feel fairly clear.
Interestingly enough, I find myself using the personal
pronoun, as it were, all of a sudden. It is because the
Circle gives me a new conception of the Centre.
Why do I thus begin to realize that the Point is itself
a multiplicity of Points, and no less one among innumerable
Points ? Because the contemplation of the Circle-Globe
thrusts upon my notice both the fact that it is crammed full
with those Men of the Sea who themselves are globes and
universes and that it is itself a Circle-Globe among an
infinitude of Circle-Globes. That which is so patently
characteristic of one symbol must at least be implicit in all
other symbols. So when I observe a dominant charac-
teristic in one symbol I am forced to relate it to every
other symbol.

The Point must therefore be a multiplicity of Points,
and one among many Points. The Web that is the Womb
must be constituted of a multiplicity of Webs that are
Wombs, and one among many Webs that are Wombs.
The Line must therefore be a multiplicity of Lines, and one
among many Lines. There cannot be a characteristic of
one symbol that is not inherent in every other symbol.
I wish I could carry this conception much farther, but
the way so to do eludes me entirely for the moment.
In his Principles of Nature and Grace, Leibniz draws
attention to the fact that
simplicity of substance is
by no means inconsistent with the
multiplicity of the modifications which are to be found together
in that same simple substance, and these modifications must
consist in a variety of relations to the things which are outside.
It is as in the case of a centre or point, in which, although it is
perfectly simple, there is an infinite number of angles formed by
the lines which meet in it.
My experience endorses every word of this statement,
for while on the one hand I
perceive a wonderful simplicity
as characteristic of every symbol, giving an impression of
ultimate unity, on the other hand there is in each a com-
plexity of lines producing a Web-like effect. In fact, each
Line to my seeing is a Web, and I sometimes wonder if I could
see behind the Web into No-Web, whatever No-Web may
be. Even the Point, as I know it, is instinct with the Web into
which it vibrates in outer form when the appointed time has
come ; and therefore the concept of the Line is no less
instinct in the Point, in its Silence and Darkness, within the
Ceaseless Breath of God. So is it with the Circle which is
but the Line extended, and with the Cross, the Svastika,
and the very Lotus itself.
Possibly there may be a Line, not the Line with which
we are here concerned, of which the Point is but a point*
But still the Web-idea pursues us even there. And we
are now gazing into regions of which we can have no
conception.

if I can rightly concentrate upon the Cross, now formed
with the flashing into being of the horizontal Line, I see
that all within the Circle is set in readiness to evolve. The
Centre, the Point, is
ready to bear the whole weight of the
evolutionary, of the revolving, process. The Web-Womb
is there as the indestructible Matrix. The Line is there as
the unchangeable Divine Measure. The Circle is there as
the Ring-Pass-Not, and as the mighty frontier throwing
evolution back upon itself, as the mystic phrase seems to
be a glimpse of the sea of evolution surging outwards to
the Circumference through the power of the Centre, and
surging backwards to the Centre through the power of the
Circumference.
1
The surging of evolution is out to the
Ring-Pass-Not from the Centre, surges up against the Ring-
Pass-Not, and is thus thrown back to the Centre an etern-
al process of outbreaking and inbreathing. It is as if the
Triangle-Men constituting the sea of evolution were, or
rather are, continuously being tossed from the Centre to
the Circumference, and then back again from the Circum-
ference to the Centre. And this tossing is the working of
the Law of Adjustment whereby Men become Kings and
Gods at their Centres of kingdoms stretching forth to far-off
Circumferences.
Out of this restless poise comes the Svastika Salva-
tion, Well-being. The churning of the Cream of Fulfil-
ment from the milk of experience. If I can rightly con-
centrate upon the Svastika, I
may gain a conception as to
the nature of Well-being, and establish its harmonies and
rhythms, its cadencies and its vibrations, in each one of my
states of consciousness.
In so doing I
may gain my first real glimpse of that
sublime Trinity-in-One of Seed-Bud-Flower the Lotus Fire,

Such indeed is the purpose of sublimation of state
after state of consciousness. Such indeed is the purpose
of symbol after symbol in this form of Yoga. Such is the
purpose of establishing in perfect Will, and Wisdom, and
Fructification, each symbol in the very heart itself of each
ring of consciousness, from the Centre to the Circumference.
When we can see God the Lotus, and know ourselves
to be as He, then do we begin in reality to tread the Way
of Yoga that we may become its Lords.
THE LOTUS
"
The significance of the tradition that Brahma is born from
or in the Lotus, is the same. The Lotus symbolizes a world-
system, and Brahma dwells therein representing action , he is
therefore called the Kamal-asana, the Lotus-seated. The Lotus,
again, is said to arise from or in the navel of Vishnu, because the
navel of Vishnu or all-knowledge is
necessary desire, the primal
form of which, as embodied in the Veda-text is
May I be born
forth (as multitudinous progeny). From such central and essential
desire, the will to live, arises the whole of becoming, all the opera-
tions, all the whirls and whorls, of change and manifestation which
make up life." Bhagavan Das, Pranava-Vada, I, 82
"
Activity on one plane is consonant with rest on another.
The jiva is tireless, but the vehicles tire and wear out. Hence,
that the body may sleep, the jiva, leaving it, energizes another
vehicle, and is active through it on another plane. And also,
Maha-Vishnu, sleeping in the ocean, is active in ideation on the
creative plane, and the result is the growth of the Lotus, and the
appearance of Brahma, the creator on the planes of manifestation."

You may perform your Yoga in any of and in all the
centres of your being in your heart, in your mind, in your
will, in any chakra, in any of and in all
your vehicles. You
may perform your Yoga in terms of your Ray, be it of
Sound or of Colour or of Form.
But, as I have already said, you must be overflowing
with the fruition of your Yoga, for your individualization of
Yoga must be to the end of its universalization.
Where will you perform your Yoga ? In your home,
in the garden, in some quiet spot in the house, perhaps
even in the very midst of all the bustle and noise of its
activities.
Perhaps a flash of it as you go on your way to
business, or in your office, or in a moment snatched from
its duties.
This form of Yoga is not for him who renounces the
world, not for the so-called ascetic, but for him who
fulfils the world, lives in it, and shares life with it. It is the
Yoga of the man and the woman in the world, though not
of the man or woman of the world. It is the Yoga of the
market-place and not the Yoga of the forest, though some
day it will lead to the forest which is in the market-place.

It is the Yoga for the family, for father and mother,
for husband and wife, for the business man, for the artist,
for workers in all
departments of human living.
It is the Yoga for all in whom an intimation of their
essential kingship is
stirring, and who are at least dimly
discerning that in every living creature there is
kingship too,
not yet perhaps human kingship, but a kingship appropriate
to his stage on the evolutionary way.
It is a Yoga of Liberation. But those who follow it
seek its potent adjustments in themselves not for them-
selves alone, but for all Life. They seek its blessing that
they may share it with their fellow-lives. And they know
that the achievement of true Liberation, even by a single
individual, lifts all other individualities a step higher on
its Ladder. There is no entry at any time into true Free-
dom save as others are entering into theirs.
So is it that its votaries are intent on stirring in every
form of life in every kingdom of nature its own Yoga of
Liberation, knowing that such intent is vital in their own
individual Yogas.
The sign of the true Yogi is that in his acts of Yoga
he enfolds life outside his own. He shares his Yoga with
his fellow-Yogis, be they of the mineral, vegetable, animal,
or human kingdoms.
Nothing is more remarkable in the great acts of Yoga
of Lords of Yoga than the fact that they are performed as
blessing and as service, and not as self-seeking.
In the outer world the pseudo-Yogi seeks for himself
alone. In the world of Yoga the Truth is
sought that it
may be shared with others.
Become the Sound and Light and Form of your race,
of your nation, of your faith, of your community, of your
Manhood and of your Godhead. So do you fulfil the
individual Yoga of your uniqueness and the Universal Yoga
of the One Life.

And as fulfilment is thus expressed in course of its un-

the Truth that is Life.
Yoga is Union union between yourself as Man and
yourself as God, between your Self and all other Selves, to
the greater glory of the Unity of Life.
The Yoga of the Forthgoing is Universal Yoga. The
Yoga of the Return is Individual Yoga. The Yoga of the
Journey's End is both.
I have said that an individual may perform his Yoga in
any centre of himself and in any aspect of himself.
But there are also places outside the individual which
are very powerful aids to the right performance of Yoga,
and those students who know how may utilize such places.
The Niagara Falls are one such region, and Mount
Vesuvius another. In Africa there is more than one region,
including the Victoria Nyanza Falls. There is a place for
special forms of Yoga in the North Sea. Both in northern
and in southern America there are centres for Yoga prac-
tice. Sacred places are often powerful magnetic areas,
and in the Himalayan range of mountains there are many
places dedicated to Yoga from countless ages in the past.
But the region of most profound potency is, I
think,
Mount Gaurishankar,
1
miscalled Mount Everest.
Those who in super-physical bodies have dwelt in Yoga
on the summit of this stupendous King tell us of the most
marvellous Silence and Darkness they have there experienced.
The Silence is torrential. The Darkness is abysmal.
Cataclysmic vastnesses of Silence and of Darkness surge
through a Cosmic Space and seem, as it were, thick with
unfathomable power. The Darkness dazzles with its Light-
lessness. The Silence overwhelms with its Soundlessness.
The whole atmosphere is awe-ful in its impenetrable
intensity.

The Spirit of

The power of Gaurishankar rends inconceivable
heights and fades away into infinities ; and the Yogi who is
serene amidst it
disappears into consciousness far beyond
his reach, and is
only halted by a Ring-Pass-Not of his
present limitation, extended though this be by the magic
of his setting.
But when the Yogi is thus truly set, he sees. And
before his gaze appear sublimities, forthshadowings of the
Realities I have been endeavouring to portray in symbols.
I think each place of Yoga has its
appropriate experi-
ences, its channels to different regions of Reality. It occurs
to me that Gaurishankar is a shadow in its own kingdom
of the First Logos.
Often and often my thoughts turn to this glorious
witness to God's awesome Divinity Mount Everest, as we
so unfortunately term this mighty King of the mineral
kingdom, holding sway as he does over many denizens of
the vegetable and higher kingdoms themselves.
Often and often I think of the great Spirit of Everest,
of Him who makes Everest His home, and who holds the
holy Mountain in holy keeping for its high purposes.
I think of the times when I
go far, far down into
the depths of Everest, and enter into a section of the
laboratory of the world. I think of the times when I ascend
and ascend, up to the very summit itself, up to the wind-
swept, storm-tossed apex of the Mountain. And I enter
into an Abode of Tapas, of Meditation, where dwells the
Guardian, and to which have access those who are Sons
and Lords and Kings of Tapas.
Would that I were an artist to paint the supernal
glories of this Place of Bliss ! The soft, caressing plains that
encircle it, the first slight risings of the ground, then a more
insistent ruggedness, accompanied by a nature utterly dis-
tinct from the nature of the plains and of the earlier slopes.
Then the sharper ascents, until we come to very bulwarks

of denial, only to be overcome by the intrepid and fearless.
At last we leave behind us all
gentler forms of life, we
surmount the bulwarks themselves, and we force our way
up into the dwelling-places of catastrophe and unleashed,
unrestrained forces, before which physical bodies must needs
recoil and in the end bow defeated and destroyed.
Here indeed are the regions of turmoil, of clashing
tumult, of shadows of cosmic movements, furious yet
purposeful, irresistible yet moving lawfully towards an end.
Only in our subtlest bodies dare we ascend to these awe-
some regions, for we are in the midst of great sweeping
movements of the will, of torrential avalanches from on
high. Only the strongest vehicle may encounter these
and remain whole.
Yet the very cataclysms and tempests themselves call
us to that Silence of the Summit which is one of the most
glorious things on earth, veritably a wonder of the world
infinitely more wondrous than any of the seven wonders
which man recognizes as such.
The Soul of
For in that Silence dwells the Soul of Yoga, or should I
perhaps rather say, an abode of the Soul of Yoga, for it has
more than one focus in this outer world, and the Soul of
Yoga is infinite.
It is the Silence of Everest that is its
glory. The
storms, the cataclysmic avalanches, the dark mysterious-
nesses, the whirlings of powers all these are but preludes,
ante-chambers. They are the outer court. The sanctum
sanctorum is the Silence, and in this Silence are Yogis
made, and Lords of Yoga perform their stupendous functions.
MOUNT GAURISHANKAR OR EVEREST
Though this whole group of mountains is sacred to Gauri-
shankar (Parvati and Shiva), and Mount Everest has been so
designated by those who worshipped Shiva, in the naming of each
YOGA FOR THE MAN IN THE WORLD 313
individual peak, Mount Everest has been put as Peak XV and
Mount Gaurishankar as Peak XX of the official Survey. The
Tibetans call Mount Everest
"
The White Lady of the Glaciers."
Early western discoverers of this magnificent group of mountains
attempting to ascertain the Tibetan name of this peak of
greatest glory were told,
" The Mountain is Nameless
"
; so sacred
was it in their eyes. In 1865, no name being found, the Survey
deviated from a well-established principle, i.e., always to use a
local name, and gave the mountain the name of the Survey
Director, Colonel Everest, a brilliant mathematician and geodesist,
whose genius and inspiration made the Survey possible.
Since then conflicting reports of various Tibetan names
have been given by travellers Chomo Kankar, Chholungbu,
Chomo Lungmo or Lungma, Chomo Uri, Lapchi Kung, and Milarepa
seems to have known it as Lapchi Chubat [between mountains].
One name, Mi-ti Gu-ti Cha-pu Long-nga, means "the summit that
cannot be seen from near, but afar from nine directions, and that
blinds the bird that soars aloft to its peak," or more literally,
"
No
line nine lines flying bird blind." Cho^Lord of Lords, and

Does anybody know who actually discovered Mount Everest,
the highest peak in the world ? The Indian World, the new
Bombay monthly, states that the actual discoverer of the peak was
Mr. Radhanath S.kdar, and suggests that the peak should be re-
named Mount Sikdar In his account of the
'
Progress of Physics
in India,' contributed to the volume published by the Indian
Science Congress Association, Prof. M. N. Saha mentions that
'
in 1 845, Radhanath Sikdar, the head computor of the Trigono-
metric Survey and an accomplished mathematician, found from
mathematical reduction of the observations made some years
earlier of an obscure-looking peak of the Himalayas, that this was
actually the highest peak in the world.' As these observations
were made during the regime of Colonel Everest who was then
the Surveyor-General, the peak was called after him in disregard of
the claims of the actual discoverer."

It is most important to understand that our Yoga must
be within the circumstances of our everyday living. It
must not be exclusively confined within a certain time or to a
certain place. We may have both a time and a place for
special meditation and contemplation. But this must be but
as the centre, and its power must radiate to every point on
the circumference.
We cannot be Yogis at one time and in one place,
and not Yogis at other times and in other places. Yoga
may begin at a centre, but it cannot end there. The Yoga
of God is universal within His vast domain. The Yoga of
each one of us must become universal within our micro-
scopic domains, within our individual lives.
The spirit of each of the symbols must be established
in our lives, and permeate each field of our living, and no
less each plane of our consciousness.

If we begin with the Point conception, we see at once
that we have wonderful connections to make between its
sublimities and our actualities. But we must clearly realize
that there is
nothing of the Point which we cannot in some
way or other reproduce in ourselves.
When we think of the Silence and Darkness of the
Point, we can sense a measure of its reflection in our
physical and super-physical bodies.
May I remind you of the tangibility of the Silence,
and of the Darkness ? I want you to try to establish within
yourselves a contact with that tangibility, so that you actually
feel something of a Silence which is
infinitely more than a
stillness, something of a Darkness which is
infinitely more
than an idea of blackness.
In my own experience, the sense of such tangibility is
produced in my consciousness by a certain variation from
my normal rhythms, so that the vibrations around me cease
to register, and other vibrations from afar, as it would
seem, replace them and cause me so to contact a Silence
and a Darkness that these flood me and overflow into
my far beyond.
Of course, these other vibrations may not necessarily
come from " afar." In any case, their strangeness gives
this impression.
Thus do I find myself melting into a rhythm which
gives the sense of a Silence and a Darkness not of the
substance of these worlds, not of their matter, but of their
soul, of their substans.
I achieve a movementless poise composed of an
infinitude of waves, all within my breathing of the Ceaseless
Breath of God.
Into this matrix, if I
may so call it, we pour a sense of
that Consummation which is so inherent in the Point. Into
this sense is distilled the summation of our own stupendous
past together with an aura of the future. We plumb our

fathomless past, our inscrutable present, and our fathomless
future, and there is a something which leads us to a
tangible contact with the cosmic Consummation itself.
Running through our evolutionary process have been many
smaller consummations, many lesser kingships, and the
attar
1
of these wafts us up into the supreme Kingship
of Godhead.
Under the blessing of the Eternal, the individual will
gains power to fuse the element of Time into the substance
of Eternity.
By ourselves all this is impossible. As Men we can only
achieve this on the divine plane of Manhood.
As men the achievement is
beyond our power. But, as
Gods, with the help of God, we can do it, and we do it.
But Consummation moves onwards into its Father-
Mother state of Forthgoing that Man may become king
of all kingdoms of life, and ascend into his Godhead as
a very King of Life. I think it is
quite possible to sense
this state of consciousness if we will try to discover in
ourselves a reflection of the Creative Spirit.
We are Gods. We are Creators. There is no
individuality in any kingdom of nature who is not God
tha Creator, God the Nourisher, God the Regenerator.
Our education should have discovered in us our
creative spirit. Probably it has not, and we are left to
discover it for ourselves The artist in whatever field is
making his discovery. We all are artists. There is no
" corner
"
in art for a particular set of people. Art is not
exclusive to the few. It is the individual heritage of every
living creature. What is the spirit of your Forthgoing,
not in terms of the future, but in terms of the Here and
the Now ?
Where has your Manhood discovered in your man-
hood your Godhead ?

God is Life-Giver. You cannot know your Self
save as you give Life. You cannot enter into the spirit
of any of the symbols of this form of Yoga save as you
give forth the life you have so far achieved.
You must remember the kingship you have achieved
in kingdom after kingdom of nature, and you must vivify
each kingdom with that which you have gained from it.
You must try to remember how you became a king,
and give wise help for kingship to those who have yet to
attain it.
This is what I find called the Yoga of Enfoldment,
for in many ways the heart of this Symbolic Yoga is its
insistence on the essential Unity of Life.
I have said in the earlier pages of this book that
we must take all of ourselves with us as we prepare for
Yoga not a withdrawal from but a gathering in, a
harvesting rich and all-inclusive.
But not only must we take all of ourselves with us,
we must try to take the whole world with us, and every
kingdom of nature. For the moment this may be an
impossible task, but we certainly can travel on our way
with more right attachments than the number accompanying
us now.
And I have reserved for this point the fact that
Yoga is not only to be performed in some special places
highly magnetized for the purpose, but also within the
aura of any Man in any kingdom of nature, for he is
God and therefore sacred.
Each one of you has, I
expect, a deeply loved

And we may perform this Yoga even in the spirit
of a memory of some cherished event, or in the magic
evocation of a look, of an appearance, of a fragrance, of a
sound, of a colour, or of a form.
The time comes when, through constant practice, the
Yoga comes quickly to us, needs at times but little
prepara-
tion, flashes upon us almost unawares, and baptizes us into
power.
I have so far been dealing with this form of Yoga-
practice in the light of the symbol of the Point. But is it
not clear that every symbol -conception must no less be drawn
into the intimacies of our lives, each symbol in turn re-
ceiving the attention of our consciousness and thus glowing
into radiance.
And remember that each symbol has its
reality in
every Man dwelling in
every kingdom of nature. Naught

is there but the Real anywhere. What we are pleased
to term the Unreal is but other-Real, that Real which is no
longer to be in the vanguard of our living, not even in
the main army, but in the no less vital rearguard.
In a flower

dwells the Point, for the flower is a
Silence and a Darkness, a Consummation and a Forthgoing.
In the flower moves rhythmically the Ceaseless Breath of
God. In the flower dwells the Web that is the Womb.
In the flower is that Line which shoots forth from the
Centre to North and South. The flower is a very universe
in itself, is encircled by its own self-contained nature. The
flower contains within itself the Svastika of its own indi-
vidual growth, reflection of the Svastika of the universe.
And every flower is
mysteriously the shadow of Matri-
padma, the Mother- Lotus of us all.
I am vividly reminded of the exquisite verse of Blake,
that really great Yogi :
To see a World in a grain of sand,
And a Heaven in a wild flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,
And Eternity in an hour.
So, as we perform our Yoga, the flower, and every
other Yogi in all
kingdoms of nature, is stirred to the very
depths of its being, and stirs us to the depths of ours.
However much we may be in the midst of our individual
Yoga as climbers three-quarters way up the human moun-
tain side, reinforcing our Yoga with this symbolic form,
nonetheless do we retain our essential membership of that
Universal Yoga in which all life lives and moves and has its
being, particularly concerned though it be with the sub-
human kingdoms and a large proportion of humanity, for
all its apparent individual ization.
From personal observation I would say that there is
nothing to exceed in glory the flashing Line of Vitalization
as it shines forth in every Man in every kingdom of nature*

In many ways I select this as, to me, the most extraordinary
demonstration of the symbols at work, or rather of the life
of the symbols at work. It is indeed a revelation to per-
ceive this wondrous Line, a vertical Light of perpetual
movement flashing upwards into the Heavens and down-
wards into the Earths, making of every Heaven an Earth,
and of every Earth a Heaven.
It is a revelation to see this Line in every atom as
a kind of vertical axis, in every form, in every living thing,
in ourselves a perfect Rod of Power whereby the flower
on earth reaches up into its heaven of delight.
I see this Line to be the joy of all
things. All Men
in every kingdom of nature have their contentments, their
bliss, their peace, their aspirations, even though they may
also have their pains and sorrows. And while the life in
every symbol brings to them the wherewithal to praise
their living, in some special way, possibly because I
may
belong to the Line Archetype though I do not at all know
the flashing, sparkling, dancing, perpetually moving Line
rejoices me more than the life of any other symbol, save
that which makes the Lotus Fire so glorious.
I wish I could have suggested acts of Yoga appro-
priate to each plane of consciousness helping to an un-
foldment of each symbol in terms of each state of con-
sciousness, from the physical within. I
feel, however, that
my Teacher intervened and intimated that neither could
I do this, nor any who might study this form of Yoga.
We know exceedingly little about the various planes and
states of consciousness, and we should soon become lost
in a maze of inextricable and disturbing confusion. This
would undo any good which any simpler approach, such
as we have been undertaking, may be able to achieve.
We must perform our acts of Yoga in the simplest
possible manner, and in the most general terms. I have
sketched above a few suggestions in connection with the
THE YOGA OF ENFOLDMENT 321

Noon
symbol of the Point. Each student may develop these as
he finds most suitable, and he must devise other exercises
for other symbols, and for differing states of consciousness,
as he grows more and more familiar with the elements
which have been set forth above though I am bound to
say that even the suggestions I have been able to make are
not as simple as they might be and require the deepest
relaxation and most harmonious poise.
I have said that no special times are necessary for this
form of Yoga. Yet, since every advantage must be taken of
favourable external conditions, the student should endeavour
to obtain from some competent astrologer a reading of his
most smoothly flowing moments, so that day by day he
may synchronize his Yoga with these. When does the
Man-Woman perform most easily his Yoga ? When the
Woman-Man ?
I should also recommend that sunrise and sunset and
noon, crucial or flux times of downpouring, are the best
times of day for any meditation, with, of course, a pervading
sense of ease, of quiet and of peace.
FAVOURABLE PERIODS OF TIME
"
When yang [the Positive Force] has reached its greatest
strength, the dark power of yin [the Feminine Force] is born with-
in its depths ; night begins at midday when yang breaks up and
begins to change into ym," says l-Ching in The Secret of the
Golden Flower.
Yang, therefore, is Lord of the period from Midnight to Noon ;
Y/n, the Lady of the period from Noon to Midnight.
Social activities usually take place between noon and midnight
when Ym is dominant ; hard and strenuous labour, where men
live naturally, in the early morning and until noon. In Bulgaria,
where there are many peasants who work strenuously and act-
ively, and yet live to celebrate their hundredth birthday, there
are whole villages who go to sleep at six in the evening with
the fall of dusk, and awake shortly after midnight, working from
then till noon. Many occultists find the
"
wee sma' hours of the
morning
"
an excellent time for adventurous research.

some contemplative orders find their most favourable conditions at
midnight, as do also, by the way, most forces working against the
movement of the Wheel of the Law.
TRUE RENUNCIATION
"
The liberated individual has the consciousness of the time-
less infinite and with that as his background, takes his place in the
temporal world. He has what the seers called trikaladrishti, an
intuition of time in which past, present and future exist together
for ever in the self-knowledge and self-power of the eternal. He
is no more swept helplessly on the stress of the moments. He
lives in the consciousness of the universal mind and works for the
welfare of the world in an unselfish spirit. True renunciation is not
abandonment of action, but unselfish conduct." The Cultural
Heritage of India, Vol. I, p. xxx.
"
The householder shall have his life established in Brahma,
shall pursue the deeper truth of all things, and in all activities of
life dedicate his works to the Eternal Being. Thus we have come
to know that what India truly seeks is not a peace which is in
negation, or in some mechanical adjustment, but that which is in
Sf)/Vam, in goodness ; which is in Advaitam, in the truth of perfect
union ; that India does not enjoin her children to cease from
karma, but to perform their karma in the presence of the Eternal,
with the pure knowledge of the spiritual meaning of existence."

associate with each symbol certain virtues. These you will

the association of virtues or qualities with particular symbols :

Poise, Grace, Dignity, Self-Restraint, Attentiveness. The
Spirit of Creation, Glory of Infinity, Unit of Life.

Purity, Consecration,
Dedication, Sacrifice, Reverence. The Spirit of Receiving-to-
Give, Creation-Becoming. The whole spirit of the response
of Mary the Mother :
" Behold the handmaid of the Lord ;
be it unto me according to Thy word." 1
This symbol may
seem to be specially relevant to woman, but there is equal
relevancy to man for where is the essential difference,
even though there may be time-differences in physical
construction ?

Aspiration, Steadfastness, Perseverance,
Poise, Balance, Order, Virility. Will Incarnate. Kingship.

change. But be busy about associating power with each

I have elsewhere suggested to you that it is
convenient to send forth your Yoga through some special

My own personal choice is as follows :
The mineral kingdom : Mount Everest, the Opal.
The vegetable kingdom : The Lotus, the Rose, the
Banyan Tree.
The animal kingdom : The Elephant, the Horse, the
Cow, the Cat, almost any young creature.
The human kingdom : Those specially near and dear
to me, my intimate fellow-workers, my spiritual elders in
this kingdom, certain world personages of this and of other
ages, and other persons chosen for a variety of reasons.
But I will also fortify my Yoga with splendours from
other kingdoms as well as from my own.
From the mineral kingdom I receive the majesties of
its mountains, the pure blessings of its
kingly jewels, the
immortality of its
ageless rocks, the spirit of ceaseless play
in its impersonal seas, the relentless depth of life in its
ordered structure, the gracious spirit of Motherhood
from its soil.
From the vegetable kingdom I receive the calm
nobility of its trees, and in particular of the poise of venera-
bility from the banyan tree, and the silence of its forests,
the ardent reverence of its flowers, the marvels of
its forms.
1
From the animal kingdom I receive, for example, the
quality of grace from the deer, of devotion from the dog,
of dignity from the lion, of independence from the cat, of
poise from the horse, of wisdom from the elephant, of
Motherhood from the cow. And from the birds I receive,
curiously enough, the quality of dauntlessness allied to the
Mother-spirit of protection.

Ruskin on Birds
A Vista of Air,
Fire. Water
SYMBOLS RELEASED AND DYNAMIC
One of the great Yogis, Ruskin, has written so
exquisitely about birds, and so truly, that I cannot but quote
at a little
length an utterance which should reveal to you
how Godlike is Man, be he man such as ourselves, or Deva
such as shall be the birds.
His theme is that the Air incarnates in the bird and
you get a tremendous vista of Air, Fire and Water incarnat-
ing and evolving :
"
[A bird]
is little more than a drift of the air brought
into form by plumes ; the air is in all its quills, it breathes
through its whole frame and flesh, and grows with air in
its
flying, like a blown flame : it rests upon the air, subdues
it, surpasses it, outraces it : is the air, conscious of itself,
conquering itself, ruling itself.
41
Also, into the throat of the bird is
given the voice
of the air. All that in the wind itself is weak, wild, useless
in sweetness, is knit together in its song. As we may
imagine the wild form of the cloud closed into the perfect
form of the bird's wings, so the wild voice of the wind
into its ordered and commanded voice ; unwearied, rip-
pling through the clear heaven in its gladness, interpreting
all intense passion through the soft spring nights, bursting
into acclaim and rapture of choir at daybreak, or lisping
and twittering among the boughs and hedges through heat
of day, like little winds that only make the cowslip bells
shake, and ruffle the petals of the wild rose.
41
Also, upon the plumes of the bird are put the
colours of the air : on these the gold of the cloud, that
cannot be gathered by any covetousness ; the rubies of
the clouds, that are not the price of Athena, but are
Athena ; the vermilion of the cloud-bar, and the flame of
the cloud-crest, and the snow of the cloud, and its shadow,
and the melted blue of the deep wells of the sky all
these, seized by the creating spirit, and woven by Athena
herself into films and threads of plume ; with wave on
THE YOGA OF RECEPTIVITY 327

Kingdom
wave following and fading along breast, and throat, and
opened wings, infinite as the dividing of the foam and the
sifting of the sea-sand even the white down of the cloud
seeming to flutter up between the stronger plumes, seen,
but too soft for touch.
"
And so the Spirit of the Air is
put into, and upon,
this created form ; and it becomes, through twenty cen-
turies, the symbol of divine help, descending, as the Fire,
to speak, but as the Dove, to bless."
From the human kingdom I receive all that makes it
the splendid kingdom it is
designed and destined to be.
I receive the courage of the hero, the grandeur of
the genius, and the compassion of the saint. I receive the
patient and dignified endurance of countless obscure
dwellers in village and in city who build their Jerusalems,
their Meccas, their Kashis, their Buddha Gayas, amidst
grinding poverties and often destitutions, but with smiles of
contentment born of that friendship and that love which no
disaster, no hardship, can ever break. I receive from the
child his fairyland, and from the mother her praise.
And what do I receive from the kingdoms beyond the
human ? For the most part I receive gifts I know not of. I
receive blessing I cannot comprehend. I receive glories
which sound in me the eternal tension-thrills of my Divine
Purpose. Those of the superhuman kingdoms are content
to give and bless and exalt. It is not response that They
are seeking, nor the smallest atom of gratitude or acknowl-
edgment. For They give that which we are still unable
to measure or appraise. They seek but our quickened
following after Them into the heavens in which They suc-
cessively dwell, that each heaven may become perfect by
the abiding in it of Their brethren who tread the way They
have trodden in kingdom upon kingdom of nature.
Yet now and again I sense a fragrance from Their
blessing, and my heart reaches up in loving reverence. All

that I receive from the kingdoms of nature below my own,
and from my own, I receive from Them in sublimation.
From these kingdoms I receive the certainty of Kingship,
that in every kingdom there is Coronation after Coronation.
But from Them I receive intimation of the certainty of my
supreme Kingship in Self-conscious Divinity, and of a
Coronation which is the final glory of this evolutionary
stage of the Eternal Ascent.
From every kingdom of nature I receive admission
into that Holy of Holies common alike to them all that
sanctuary of Motherhood so gloriously honoured by every
living creature, save, I
fear, some in the human kingdom
who have forgotten their childhood, if ever they had any,
and who are passing through the sad stage of ruthlessly
treading holiness into hell.
And how mightily does each symbol glow with the spirit
of the Universal Motherhood it reflects !
The Web that is the Womb is saturated, I can think of
no other word, with the Mother-spirit. And while the
Ceaseless Breath of God is No-Breath in the Point, in the
Web that is the Womb the Breath vibrates with Mother-
hood. Do I in any way contact the nature of this Breath
quality ? I think I find myself contacting the conception of
intensity, of resistlessness, of a strength and power which
rise above all obstacles. I see that this glory of Mother-
hood shines forth into all things, and everywhere makes
Motherhood most wonderful.
I
bring down this conception into an expression of
Motherhood infinitely common, praise be to God, yet of
supreme exquisiteness. There could be, it seems to me,
no more certain witness to the universality of the spirit of
Motherhood than this gem of gems, this gem in exce/s/s, so
rare because of its
glory, yet so common because it is life.

front of me. Suddenly he slackened his pace, and began
to steal forward as though he scented game ahead. I
looked] along the avenue ; and I saw on the ground a
young sparrow, its beak edged with yellow, and its head
covered with soft down. It had fallen from the nest
(a strong wind was blowing, and shaking the birches
of the avenue) ; and there it sat and never stirred,
except to stretch out its little half-grown wings in a
helpless flutter.
"
My dog was slowly approaching it, when suddenly
darting from the tree overhead, an old black-throated
sparrow dropped like a stone right before his nose,
and all
rumpled and flustered, with a plaintive desperate
cry flung itself once, twice, at his open jaws with their
great teeth.
"
It would save its young one ; it screened it with its
own body ; the tiny frame quivered with terror ;
the little
cries grew wild and hoarse ; it sank and died. It had sacri-
ficed itself. What a huge monster the dog must have
seemed to it ! And yet it could not stay up there on its
safe bough. A power stronger than its own will tore it
away. My dog stood still and slunk back disconcerted.
Plainly he too had to recognize that power. I called him
to me ; and a feeling of reverence came over me as I
passed on."
Perfect m Yoga This is from the Russian author Tourgueniev quoted in
my The Life Magnificent. And to know that the glory of this
little sparrow is the glory of all
things, your glory, my glory !

The Yoga of
"... take merely an ounce or two of the blackest
Jewel- '
becoming slime of a beaten footpath, on a rainy day, near a manu-
facturing town. That slime we shall find in most cases
composed of clay (or brickdust, which is burnt clay),
mixed
with soot, a little sand, and water. All these elements are
at helpless war with each other, and destroy reciprocally
each other's nature and power ;
competing and fighting
for place at every tread of your foot ; sand squeezing out
clay, and clay squeezing out water, and soot meddling
everywhere, and defiling the whole. Let us suppose that
this ounce of mud is left in perfect rest, and that its ele-
ments gather together, like to like, so that their atoms may
get into the closest relations possible.
" Let the clay begin. Ridding itself of all foreign
substance, it
gradually becomes a white earth, already very
beautiful, and fit, with the help of congealing fire, to be
made into finest porcelain, and painted on, and be kept in
kings' palaces. But such artificial consistence is not its
best. Leave it still quiet, to follow its own instinct of unity,
and it becomes, not only white, but clear ; not only clear,
but hard ; not only clear and hard, but so set that it can
deal with light in a wonderful way, and gather out of it the
loveliest blue rays only, refusing the rest. We call it then
a sapphire.
"
Such being the consummation of the clay, we give
similar permission of quiet to the sand. It also becomes,
first a white earth ; then proceeds to grow clear and
hard, and at last arranges itself in mysterious, infinitely
parallel lines, which have the power of reflecting, not
merely the blue rays, but the blue, green, purple, and
red rays, in the greatest beauty in which they can be seen
through any hard material whatsoever. We call it then
an opal.
THE YOGA OF RECEPTIVITY 331
" In next order the soot sets to work. It cannot
make itself white at first ; but, instead of being discouraged,
tries harder and harder ; and comes out clear at last ;
and the hardest thing in the world ; and for the blackness
that it had, obtains in exchange the power of reflecting
all the rays of the sun at once, in the vividest blaze that
any solid thing can shoot. We call it then a diamond.
" Last of all, the water purifies or unites itself ; con-
tented enough if it
only reach the form of a dewdrop ; but,
if we insist on its proceeding to a more perfect consistency,
it
crystallizes into the shape of a star. And, for the ounce
of slime which we had by political economy of competition,
we have by political economy of co-operation, a sapphire, an
opal, and a diamond, set in the midst of a star of snow."
Acts of Yoga I wish I had the magic wherewith to unveil the Yoga
are in every , . , j r
Form whereby every Man in every kingdom passes upwards trom
an unconscious citizenship in the beginning to a conscious
kingship at the end. Look where you will, gaze upon any
form, and you are seeing an act of Yoga performed before
your very eyes.

Perhaps in the human kingdom you see this act most
clearly ; for at the beginning there is the savage from
one point of view at a level lower than that of a king in
the animal kingdom, since he is
only an unconscious citizen
of his new kingdom, though from another point of view, of
course, higher who slowly through incarnation after incar-
nation ascends the human scale, becomes what we call
11
civilized," and at long last ascends the throne of human
evolution, and passes thence to citizenship of a kingdom
far more glorious. So is it
everywhere, and some day
when the Yoga of Life is unveiled to us more than hereto-
fore, we shall know how glorious is Life everywhere, how
perfect are Life's Laws, and how there is no darkness at
all, neither shadow of turning, even in the blackest of
tragedies or despairs.

And what is
perhaps the most glorious fact of all, still
unknown to most of us today, is that we ourselves form
part of those very Laws whereby Life descends, ascends
and transcends.
We are the Life and the Law, and when we know
this, it becomes our heaven-sent privilege to help to cause
the Law to function in those very blacknesses which seem
to deny all
Light, and in those very floutings of Law which
seem to deny Law's power.
The most glorious thing for the human kingdom is that
we are the Life and know it, we are the Law and know it,
we are the Light and know it. That is the Yoga of the
human kingdom.
Without us, the Law will work to its appointed end.
With us, the Law will work more quickly. And so it is
that there are those in the world who are beginning to
know the Law and serve it the reformers, the philan-
thropists, the saints, those who stand for Law against wrong r
for Law against cruelty, for Law against persecution, for
Law against injustice, for Law against tyranny.
The servers of the Law help Yogis everywhere to fulfil
their Yoga. They help the clay to become the sapphire,
the sand to become the opal, the soot to become
the diamond, the water to achieve its unity in a star
of snow.
They walk discreetly and reverently amidst all forms
of life. The very paths and streets they tread are trodden
with grace and dignity, not thoughtlessly but thoughtfully,
not unconsciously but attentively. They notice the Yogis
growing around them grass-Yogis, earth-Yogis, rock-Yogis,
mountain-Yogis, flower-Yogis, tree-Yogis, the Yogis in the
animal kingdom, and no less those of the human kingdom.
They strive to help each Yogi on his way, be he uncon-
scious in the Universal Yoga, or growing into Self-conscious-
ness in the higher reaches of the human kingdom.

handling it, which is one of the truest signs of an awaken-
ing Yoga.
All evolving life will know them to be friends and
helpers, and around them will spread that quietude and
peace which Ruskin has so beautifully described as an
essential part of the growth of clay and sand and soot.
We are still far away from living such a life as I have
suggested to be characteristic of the real Yogi. But we
can always make a beginning, and pursue it, even though
we must often fail.
THE RAYS
In Gods m the Becoming I have endeavoured to suggest
certain characteristics of each Ray, those whom each Ray most
affects, those who are candidates for service on each Ray, the
temperamental weaknesses of those on each Ray with corrective
qualities, and the ideal of each Ray.
Briefly, Ray One is the Ray of Kingship, though also highly and
purely and instantaneously creative. On this Ray a thing is done
when it is begun. It is a Ray of profundity, of crystal-clear-cut
purpose. Ray Two is the Ray of Direct Realization or Intuitional
Wisdom, a wide, all-embracing conception of Reality, unimprisoned
by form The First Ray marks the Release of Will. The Second
Ray, the Release of Wisdom or Law and its perfect application to
every circumstance.
The five remaining Rays may be considered as One Ray,
the Activity Ray, in which the Release of Fire or Life is the marked
characteristic.
On the Third Ray, Will-Wisdom, Truth, while yet formless, is
becoming differentiated so that it
may inhabit all forms. This is
the Ray of Creative, Spiritual, Abstract Law and Science, and
is peculiarly cosmic in outlook. As on this Ray the intimate rela-
tionship between all things is
keenly realized, it has been called
the
"
All Things to All Men
"
Ray.
In the consummation of the Fourth Ray, there is
beauty and
harmony and balance, but there are tremendous storm and con-
flict channels involving that consummation. Those on this Ray are

again comes back into the One Ray, the Ray of Subjective Symbol.
From the F/fth Ray, that of Scientific Accuracy, is disseminated
Pure Knowledge, so that through Knowledge man may ascend to
Wisdom. On this Ray there is the search for Truth as Truth in Form.
It deals with the descent of Archetypes into Form. The whole
evolutionary process in its man-woman idea.
The Sixth Ray is one of Burning Fire, Purification, Creative
Aspiration and Exaltation. Those showing the marked character-
istics of this Ray are God- or ideal-intoxicated. It
gives the capacity
of Triumph-m-Failure.
The Seventh Ray is that of a Magic Bridge between various
evolutions human, angelic, sub-human, etc. Truth is seen in
terms of formulae, symbol, relationship. Creative activity in terms
of art, beauty, spiritual magic, real ceremonial. It has to do with
the construction of channels whereby Life may flow to its appoint-
ed destinations. The Ray of the Creative Imagination, the making
of the unreal real.
Much significant information on the Rays is to be found

THE YOGA OF ART
A Supreme
Revelation
The Dangers of
Art
Art is the Divine coming down and becoming one with the
body, emotion, and mind. Religion is Divinity expressed inwardly ;
Art is
Divinity expressed outwardly. Rukmini Devi
Art is related to life much as mathematics are related to
discovery : that is, as a direction-finder and foreshadower of things
to come. -Claude Bragdon
Very sacred is the vocation of the artist, who has to do
directly with the works of God, and interpret the teaching of
creation to mankind. All honour to the man who treats it sacred-
ly ; who studies, as in God's presence, the thoughts of God which
are expressed to him , and makes all these things according to the
pattern which He is ever ready to show to earnest and reverent
genius on the mount. John Brown '
Art is one of the supreme forms of revelation, of the
intimation of the more in the regions of the less, of freeing
the imprisoned from their ignorance and fear-hardened
limitations.
But art is as dangerous to the artist as it is to him
who looks upon the art.
An artist, instinct as he may be with all that is art,
intimate as he may be with the spirit of revelation, with the
grandeur of the more, with the glory of release, may yet
become a prisoner in his own home because he has allowed
himself to adopt a posture of self-identification with the
expression of himself in some particular form. He has be*
come a prisoner because he has become a part of himself,
and thus is lost in himself, so that little by little he ceases
1

336 SYMBOLS RELEASED AND DYNAMIC
to be able to find himself and can only find a part. He can
play parts wonderfully. He can portray their forms. But he
cannot forthshadow their life. He becomes a splendidly
malleable static creature, with great capacity for flowing
into a form, but with no capacity for flowing out of it, and,
what is worse, with no capacity for revealing within the
form the life, within the individuality its eternal movement
towards its
larger self.
The True Artist An artist is ever in danger of losing himself, when he
should ever be in
process of fulfilling himself, and of revealing
in his very portrayal of a part the universal spirit of fulfilment.
The true artist is never satisfied with the depicting of Being.
He must always paint around it the dynamic colours of Be-
coming, so that his picture is an inspiration because it accu-
rately discloses the movement of Truth. To the true artist
a circumstance, a person, a creature, a tree, a landscape,
a building, an object of any kind, is
always more than it
appears, is always "moving," and so must he paint it, play
it, sculpture it, draw it, compose it. To the true artist form
and sound are interwoven, so that in sound he hints at
form, in form he hints at sound. How many artists, save
those in the highest reaches of their science, thus reveal
the unity of God to the diversity in man ?
The true artist ensouls the object of his artistry. He
displays at once its finiteness and its infinity. He paints its
inevitable imperfection by dynamically contrasting this with
its own individual more which he imaginatively and intuitively
deduces from the less, animates from the less, in the
spirit or intimation of his own unfrontiered freedom and
infinite uniqueness. He reveals the more, intimates it,
releases it, even though it may be expedient to leave it
in the shadow lest it distract too much attention from
its less.
To hint at heights in depths and greater heights in lesser
is the apotheosis of all true art.
THE YOGA OF ART 337
Intimations of
larger State
The Messenger
of Release
The less must have its portrayal, but the true artist
subtly suggests the impinging more, the release-to-be, even
though but in utmost faintness. The real artist is a votary
of ceaseless movement, and can never rest content with
depicting less than movement. Even in the portrayal of
a point there must be the intimation of a line.
Furthermore, no interpretation of any kind is artistic
save as in some measure it stirs to Reverence, or to
Admiration, or to Compassion. Even when some horrible
object has to be portrayed for the sake of art, also for the
sake of art must the true artist evoke the silver lining of
compassion round the darkness of the horrible. The light
of the artist must ever shine even in the darkness appro-
priate to his picture. There must ever be to all
artistry,
whether it be in terms of sound or colour or form, a back-
ground of the goal of its fulfilment, even if the picture
depict futility. As he paints the night, the true artist hints
the dawning and the rising of the sun. And as he paints
the day, the true artist hints its zenith.
Art is the messenger of release, and where art is
great it hints at the larger state beyond the present form
of its embodiment. Thus does art ever create and make
new, leaving its watchers with the impresbion of movement,
never with a sense of futility, nor with a sense of gazing
upon an inescapability, a tragedy out of which there is no
release. The true artist always suggests a right, lawful, and
therefore noble, ending to his artistry.
Be any form of art what it
may, the test of its truth
lies in its declaration of resurrection as the inseparable con-
comitant even to an actual crucifixion.
As Truth itself never halts, ever speeding on its un-
folding way, so art never halts, nor the artist with it.

to be true to form alone. Safety mainly lies in truth
to life.
The true artist gives the sense of an ever -flowing
river, or of unfathomable depths of lake or ocean, never
of a stagnant pool, stagnant because of its quickly attainable
limitations.
The true artist senses the glory of the growth in all
things, and reveals the glory both to the living and to the
dead to those who are learning to revel in their glory,
and to those who are still blind in it.
The true artist seeks, and disdains to achieve. Others
may deem he has produced this, that or the other master-
piece. For him there is no masterpiece, only stepping-
stones on a way which to him is all the more glorious
because there seems to be no goal to be attained.
And let us realize that each one of us is an artist,
a creator, a dynamic force, a depository of unimprisona-
ble, because ever-growing, freedom.
As an artist begins to tread the heights of his existing
universe of art, he begins to perceive the necessity for form
and colour and sound in every picture he paints. Even
though he is unable actually to express sound on his canvas,
or colour from his musical instrument, or movement in
either, still he sees, and in every sound or colour he seeks
to cause others to see also, one picture, in which move-
ment, colour and sound breathe forth as one. In the lesser
reaches of Yoga, sound, colour and form issue forth as one,
while in the higher reaches they form though the verb is
entirely misleading an intangible complex radiance from
an all-pervading yet imperceptible nucleus.
The artist whose consciousness is not confined to the
lower regions of manifestation must needs suggest the
archetypal in his form, and the question may well arise as
to how far the archetype is one for all forms of artistic ex-
pression. Light is doubtless the archetype for colour. Is the
THE YOGA OF ART 339
lotus the archetype for form ? Is the humming of the bee
the archetype for sound ? Is there a descent from all these
in the colours and forms and sounds we use in the outer
world ? According to his environment and temperament,
each artist will, in all
probability, use what may be called
a sub-archetype of the essential archetype in his work. A
western artist will be influenced by a motif different from
that of an eastern artist. Only as the artist transcends local
colour, local sound and local form, will he rise into what
may be called ultimates, though the word "
ultimate
"
has
no real meaning for us time-restricted creatures.
The Struggle Modern forms of art are often struggles, some of them
towards ....
Freedom but vague gropings, to escape the conventional limitations
of art. Art can have no limitations. There can be no
man-formed code of art or of artistic appreciation. In art
it cannot be said that this is
right and that is
wrong, for
immediately a static condition thereby becomes induced.
And, while from one standpoint a piece of art must convey
form and colour and sound, even if there be form alone,
from another standpoint there enter the elements of self-
expression and of perception. A child's so-called crudity
may be far more full of meaning, may be far more artistic,
than the so-called finished product of the conventional
artist.
In what are called futurist or cubist or surrealist pro-
ductions there may often be an apparent flouting of form
or of colour or of sound, that is to say, a flouting of the
accepted conventions with regard to all these. Yet either
they may be expressions of a longing to escape from the
restrictions of existing forms and colours and sounds, or
they may be gropings towards, possibly in, regions of con-
sciousness normally shut off from the intrusions of man
explorations into, for us, virgin consciousness ; or they may
also be reflections of those downward tendencies in living to
which a proportion of humanity seems ever to be addicted.

Epstein, for example, genius as he is, is a master of
death rather than of life. We cannot help being fascinated
by his works, while we are turning away from most of them
with the feeling that they are wrong, even though greatly
wrong. It is because of the greatness in the wrong that
we feel the morbid attraction. It is because of the wrong
that we feel repelled. He takes our reverence, our ad-
miration, our compassion, and smashes them to pieces
against the impenetrable walls of his perversity. We are
left greatly lifeless.
Observing art as life, that is to say, observing in life
its constructive positiveness, in its natural forthflowing, it
seems that its truest expression or should we say, its most
original expression lies in a simplicity vibrant with complex-
ity. The single note, purified into its essential simplicity, the
single colour purified into its essential simplicity, the single
form purified into its essential simplicity these are, perhaps,
the truest reflections in these lower worlds of ours of life at
its
highest. But in each simplicity an infinite wealth must
be inherent, to be revealed on due occasion.
To express this idea in common terms, it
may be said
that while a melody is the final simplicity in sound, yet un-
less it be vibrant with unrevealed yet immanent harmony it
has not achieved its real purity. The creative spirit, and
intimations of the creative spirit, must animate all things.
Hence, the true artist seeks the simple, but remains
uncontent until he has found that simplicity which throbs
with unborn changes. His the priesthood of such simplicity.
At its altar he worships. Priest of its communion is he to
those who have learned to kneel, even though they have
not yet learned to minister.
Simplicity must indicate the many, even though nor-
mally it reveals but the One.
Music in India, for example, most naturally tends to
archetypal simplicities, to melody apparently unpregnant
THE YOGA OF ART 341
with harmony. In India we are always going back, or
rather going inwards, to the One, be it
through the avenue
of philosophy, or of daily living, or of science, or of music,
or any other of the science-arts, or of industry. Samskrit,
the very gift of the Gods to men, is
greatest in its
simpli-
city, as disclosed, for example, in the Bhagavad G/ta, and
its whole complexity is reducible to a single sound, to a
single form ; to a single colour too, no doubt.
Yet to the ears of the instructed, Indian musical simplicity
is infinitely rich both in a multitude of overtones and also in
a wealth of as yet unincarnated harmonies, which it will be
the task of the future to reveal.
Music in the West, on the other hand, equally naturally
invokes complexities, for ever does life go forth to seek the
many and to give the many a rich manifestation.
Western music is marvellous in its
complexity. Eastern
music is marvellous in its simplicity. The West must seek
the One in their music. The East must seek the many in
theirs. Indeed, one of the greatest problems at present
confronting the East is how to seek and find the many with-
out losing touch with the One. Simplicity must ever reign
supreme in India, as in most other eastern lands, even while
homage is offered to complexity.
The problem of the West is to establish the One in
unrivalled splendour while rejoicing in the richness of its
rainbo.w.
Sunlight or
Any particular form of art must, therefore, be exam-
ined both in terms of the One and of the many. Even
though it be an expression either of the Sunlight or of the
Rainbow, it must be immanent with the other, as also must
it hint at those essential forms other than the form or forms
in which it finds expression.
A drawing must not be form alone. It must hint
at sound and colour. Music must not be sound alone*
It must hint at form and colour. The intimations of

the whole must mingle with the utterances of the part
or parts.
A gesture must be alive with all that is not expressed.
A note must vibrate with its counterparts in form and
colour, and with all the rest of its universe of sound. In-
finity is
everywhere, and the discerning must hear it, see
it, feel it, sense it, in all that seems finite.
So-called modern forms of art, those which we should
call revolutionary and bizarre, must be judged to no small
extent less by that which they may seem to be, and more
by the aspiration, the groping, the real nature of the
individual responsible for their expression. The con-
ventional codes of art as set forth in schools of art, or
in the decisions of the hanging committees of the Royal
Academy or the Paris Salon, have no eternal nor even
essential value. They represent a landmark on the way
of evolving art, no more than this. The fact, therefore,
that a picture is
totally at variance with such canons of art
in no way necessarily condemns it. The test of its real
worth should not lie in the measure of the artist's clever-
ness, for an artist has no business to be clever unless he is
many other things as well and pre-eminently. Nor should
it lie in its
conformity to approved standards. But it must
lie in the extent to which the picture displays that element
of graciousness, the very fragrance of all life, the presence
of which is the hall-mark of true fineness, and the absence
of which discloses a lack of art despite all cleverness with
which the lack of art may be concealed.
Graciousness is one of the essential attributes of art,
and only the hand m which gracious elements obtain can
give expression to it
through the brush. Graciousness
covers a multitude of incapacities, but its absence is a denial
of art. Graciousness may incarnate in many modes.
Reverence is a mode of graciousness. Devotion is a mode
of graciousness. Sacrifice is the apotheosis of graciousness.
THE YOGA OF ART 343

Good manners are graciousness insofar as they are natural
and sincere.
Do surrealism, or futurism, or cubism, reveal gracious-
ness in their exponents ? Of what nature is the man or
woman ? Then shall we begin to know if she or he is an
artist. Not "
by their fruits ye shall know them/' but by
their roots ! Bohemianism is not always art. It is too often
a pose to hide a lack of art. The real greatness of his art
depends upon the character of the artist, and by the word
"
character
"
is not meant conformity to some conventional
moral and ethical code, neither does it mean a perfect
avoidance of weakness and a perfect observance of virtue.
It means an absence of all touch of sordidness and mean-
ness, of pettiness and vulgarity, of selfishness and self-
centredness, of all
depreciatory pride and self-satisfaction.
It means a full measure of generosity, of unaffected humil-
ity, of undiscriminating friendliness, of eager aspiration, of
glowing enthusiasm, of happy graciousness, of constant
search for inspiration, of life-giving discontent.
All these will be in a state of instability, for the true
artist, with the ever-widening swinging of the pendulum of
his being, must for the time being pay for touching the
heights by contacting also the depths. In the artist, the
true artist who is
reaching upwards, this instability is inevit-
able, it is
part of the nature of his growth. He swings
between the weaknesses of the depths and the virtues of
the heights. But he swings.
In any case, the average individual should refuse
utterly to be dominated, even though he may be influ-
enced, by the canons of art as laid down by its conventional
interpreters. We all are artists in one way or in another,
of one type or of another. We must seek to release our
own individual artistries, to give them their own freedoms,
to stir them to their own fulfilments. An artist can never
be part of a crowd. He must be alone. There should

of artists, expressing the genius of
some particular artist, establishing a particular line of art.
An artist, if he be a real artist, must be unique. There
must always be something different about him, distinguishing
him from all other artists, causing him to bring his own rare
gifts to the world.
An artist is the consummation, in varying perfections,
of the individuality. No individual attains his eternal flower-
ing until he has become an artist sui generis, a God wonder-
fully different from all his fellows, bringing to the Universal
One that which no other individual life can bring.
Perfect art is
perfect sacrifice, for it discloses the
holiness of God in His innumerable diversities.
We must try to avoid the idea that the artist is in a
class apart. God is the supreme Artist, and He creates
works of art out of that sea of clay which is life uncon-
scious, We are His works of art, and the glory of His
creative power lies in making us artists too, and all life in
every kingdom of nature.
Every human being, therefore, is an artist, the nature
of his artistry varying with his innate uniqueness. For
anyone to say he is no artist is to deny his very nature.
The human body itself, even in its least evolved forms, is a
veritable work of art, and the highest reaches of art are
attained in the many modes of consciousness which use it.
The soul of man is Art personified. Let no one, therefore,
say he is not an artist.
But in some the universal life of art has found chan-
nels through special forms of manifestation ; and in a few
it shines in specialized magnificence. Some are great art-
ists. But all are artists.
Art is wherever the holiness and glory of God, of
nature, of life, are made known, made manifest, to man,
through sound, through colour, through forms of many
shapes and modes.
THE YOGA OF ART 345
The greater the artist the more does he perceive this
holiness and this glory, and the more does he seek to cause
them to shine through the specialized medium of his indi-
vidual homage.
This holiness and this glory are indeed the very sub-
stance of all Life and of all living. In every kingdom of
nature dwells the holiness and glory of God. It is
every*
where for all to see. But only he who is an artist above
and beyond all normal artistry has access to this holiness
and this glory, even though but spasmodically when the
" mode
"
is on him. Only he may conjure it down into
sound, colour, form.
His conjuring, his revealing, is
according to his indi-
vidual artistic mode through music, sculpture, painting,
dancing, acting, speaking, craftsmanship, teaching, ruling,
ministering, service, ceremonial, sacrifice, writing, discover-
ing, and through the silences of pure being.
He is a priest of the holiness and glory of Life, and
no sound can be uttered, no colour painted, no line drawn,
in which there is not some intimation, however soft and
far-off, of his worship. For, being a priest, he must needs
be a messenger, to bring the beautiful wisdom of God to
the poor ignorance of man.
The Priest of He who stops short at ignorance, without hinting at
its resolution into wisdom, is no artist in reality (save as we
all are artists),
however much he may be called an artist.
Where there is no vision splendid the peoples perish. The
artist is a priest of its remembrance.
The Yoga of Art But while all are born artists, all are priests in the
becoming of holiness and glory, there is for him who
would dedicate himself to special modes of artistic mani-
festation a veritable Yoga of Art, a Ritual of Art, to help
him to become established in strength in the eternal Real,
to be in the outer world of storm and stress and doubt a
shining lighthouse of impregnable and imperishable strength.

" In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God," In this magic
sentence lies the whole fundamental simplicity of Yoga and
of all the most elaborate Ritual. The deep student of
Yoga knows what this Word is, and how it is to be uttered.
But in the beginning was this Word not just as Word, as a
combination of letters. It was Sound Sound which the
Word embodied. And not only was it Sound. It was also
Colour Sound and Colour in terms of archetypal Form.
The complicated universe we see around us, the
apparently infinite complexity of its manifestation, the
awesome wonders of the cosmos vibrant in the minutest
individual life : all constitute but an infinitude of variations
upon a single theme, the theme of the unfolding of this
universe of ours. Only the greatest among the Master-
Artists can ever have come face to face with this theme
whether In terms of its radiant colour majestic component
of the White Light of the Eternal ; or in terms of its pure
note a magic unity pregnant with its perfect Song ; or in
terms of its simple form matrix-form of all unfoldment.
Only the greatest among the Master-Artists know how
to gaze upon pure abstract Being, necessarily through at
least one veil of Becoming, whereby to capture the Art of
the Eternal within a sketch of time.
Only a Master-Artist can give even the feeblest echo
of such a theme.
But we are told that this theme is itself a reflection of
that Eternal Theme of the Infinite in movement, of the In-
finite swinging towards its Southern Pole from Northern
Heights of cosmic Poise.
We are told that this theme-reflection is the outward
and visible sign of the stirring of our own universe from its
own North to the South of its inclination, ere turning home-
wards to the North once more.

In essence it
appears that this theme is the bridge of
contact between a Heaven of Bliss and an Earth of Unfold-
ment, that it is
primordial movement, that it is the Pledge
of God in the Purpose of Life.
In terms of sound it is the note of fulfilment. In terms
of colour it is the aura of achievement. In terms of form
it is the father-mother of all forms.
Fulfilment is not yet there. Achievement is not yet
there. No birth is there yet of the myriad forms which
shall crowd the formful worlds. But the sleeping Sea stirs
from its
trembling hush, and thrills faintly with glorifying
voice, with rainbow colours, and with forms uprising to God.
Here is the essence of all
Yoga, of the Yoga of the
artist, as of all other individualizing life.
It is the Point, the Point of Being, in terms of form, of
colour, of sound. Round the Point thus vibrating gathers the
circumference of its
totality. Within the circumference of
its
totality it stretches upwards and downwards, and the
Line of Fertilization or Becoming is formed. Within the
circumference of its totality it stretches outwards to its
farthest frontiers, and the Line of Manifestation is formed.
The Line of Fertilization or Becoming is the standard of
Manifestation, while the Line of Manifestation is the actual
mode of Manifestation itself. And in the Cross- Svastika
thus formed the Earth of Unfoldment flowers into the
Heaven-Lotus-Fire of Bliss.
The Lord Buddha is on the Lotus-Cross of Spirit and
glorifies the Lotus in its Fire-Flower. Shri Krishna as He sounds
His flute builds the fiery bridge between Heaven and Earth.
Shri Krishna glorifies the Lotus in its eternal Fire-Roots. The
cosmic Christ, in Yoga at all events, encompasses in triumph
the whole circumference of evolution, fulfilling,
in His perfect
uprightness, the Line of Fertilization, or Becoming, and the
Line of Manifestation in His perfect unity. There are, of
course, no portrayals of the Lord Muhammad. But His life

too was the Life of Consummation, while in the life of
Zarathushtra are uniquely glorified the very substance of
Point, of Lines, of Universe : Fire the Creator, the Up-
holder, the Regenerator.
We are told that the myriad-petalled white Lotus is
perhaps the supreme manifestation of perfected Life. It is
the Form of all forms, the Fire of all flames, the Infinite
Theme containing within itself all themes of all universes
and worlds. Hence its overt relation to some of Those
who " know the Lotus."
For the purposes of human Yoga within the limitations-
of the lower consciousness, we are told we must recognize
that man is
typical of the middle point of a stage of the
evolutionary process. Heaven is beyond him, though lying,
in a mode of its
being, about him in his infancy. Earth
is round about him as he treads his upward way. Heavens
have to be made for him, since he does not yet know
how to make them for himself. Hence religions, phil-
osophies, sciences, and all the glories revealed and unveiled
to him.
There is a pull from below to arrest his growth. Hence
there is
inspiration from above to hasten it. In every
department of life man stands as a focus-point for higher
and lower forces. Hence all the ills that afflict the human
world and the sub-human worlds by fact of consanguinity.
Hence the problems. Hence the despairs. Hence the
sense of impermeable darkness. Hence also, however, all
that is well with the world, and that in truth all's well with
the world.
Man is still a creature of earth, though he be wending
his way towards heaven. Our Father the Sun is the earthly
man in perfect consummated realization. Our Mother the
Earth is the earthly man in perfect rhythmic movement
towards such realization.
The Mother cherishes. The Father gives life.

Pioneers of a

And man oscillates between heaven and earth, while
as yet bound to earth. He dips down to earth for adjust-
ment, and what we call death lifts him into heaven, also
for adjustment. Indeed does he constitute a middle point,
swinging between the two adjustments. Earth seeks to
keep him, and the forms he is
learning to leave would re-
strain him from his ascent. Hence jazz. Hence all the
degradations of art. Hence all the selfishness and hatreds.
Hence man's frustration in the problems which in part he
has created round about him. The forces to drag him
down are almost as potent as those to lift him up, at this
middle point.
Theosophy and The Theosophical Society, the pioneers
of that New Age which shall be the beginning of departure
from the middle point, the great movements for peace and
brotherhood, the great discoveries for the amelioration of
the lot of man, the gradual drawing of the lower kingdoms
of nature within the magic circle of the Universal Brother-
hood all these are signs of the activity of the Universal
Yoga generated by the Elder Brethren of the world.
But the individual man who is intent on transcending
the middle point of one of his great journeys may also
perform his Yoga, his own individual transmutation of the
less into the more, may create his own crucible and fire for
'the purifying of the forces of which he is the battle-ground.
The First
Posture
For the particular type of Yoga with which I am con-
cerned in this book, the individual who is intent upon Yoga
concentration is required to stand perfectly erect with his
feet together, with his arms stretched downwards, hands In
line with the fingers together and the thumb contiguous to
the index finger, with his head erect and eyes gazing out-
wards steadfastly. His consciousness, however, is not
looking out through the windows of his eyes, but is, as it
350 SYMBOLS RELEASED AND DYNAMIC

were, established from the top of the head downwards
to the base of the spine, and the eyes themselves are
outward gazing but in that condition of no-seeing which is
so akin to all-seeing. This is the first position in this form
of Symbolic Yoga, and I have already written about it in
Chapter 33 of Book Two. It is the position both of
receptivity and of forthgoing, linking heaven and earth in
sympathetic and increasingly perfect accord through in-
creasingly perfect purity of channel.
But I wish to emphasize less the actual standing
posture and more the erectness of the spinal cord with its
consummation in the head. Though at an infinitely higher
level, the posture of Shri Krishna, as He plays His flute, is
akin to the posture I have been describing. But Shri
Krishna has, of course, sublimated the whole of Yoga
concentration. The posture of the Lord Buddha seated in
meditation and benediction is no less akin, again at an
infinitely higher level, than the posture I have been de-
scribing, and so is the posture of the Christ on the Cross.
In the case of these Great Ones there is an actual revela-
tion, to those who have the eyes to see, of an apotheosis
of individualized Yoga, indeed of so mighty an individualiza-
tion that it
merges in Universalization, but in a Universaliza-
tion scintillating with individuality. I am afraid that language
somewhat fails me here to describe these Cosmic
Apotheoses.
Obviously only the student who has an inner knowl-
edge of heaven and earth will be able to attain the re-
quired intensification of consciousness. But he who is
beginning to practise this form of Yoga may hope, with
the aid of great purity of body, emotions and mind, to
begin to awaken the Fires of Heaven and of Earth. And
let me say that I am thinking of Fires other than those of
the Kundalini of the individual. I am thinking of the
Cosmic Fire of Heaven, and of what I
may perhaps be
THE YOGA OF ART 35 1
The Posture
of Ritual

through the

allowed to call the Cosmic Fire of Earth. Only those who
know both heaven and earth can successfully chant the
mantra of their arousing.
This preliminary practice with its appropriate posture
is one of the goals of all
practices of whatever nature.
The great Yoga of Dancing has, I
believe, this upright
posture as its fundamental key-note. The Yoga of Music,
of the Arts, Sciences and Philosophies, have this form as
fundamental, even though it
may be expressed in terms of
sound or of colour. Through this posture, even though it
may not be constituted physically, man proceeds on his
road of individualization from the earliest kingdoms to that
End which itself is a new Beginning. This posture, whether
the body be standing or seated, is the initial posture of all
true meditation, for it
adjusts the physical and other bodies
to their true relativities. The physical and all other bodies
begin to be made real real in themselves and real in their
relationship to their surroundings. In Freemasonry this
posture is recognized as fundamental, though it is modified
to suit masonic rhythm. In the more accurate rituals of
ceremonial religions it has its place, here again with the
necessary modifications. It is a practice which must be
observed with the utmost regularity at those times of day
which provide conditions of least resistance,
1
and in due
time the ph/sical body will gain rhythm and smooth
channelship.
Cosmically, we may possibly conceive this posture to
be subsequent to many more fundamental still. There are
hints to this effect, but they are beyond my understanding.
For us this posture is fundamental, and may be regarded
as archetypal in every kingdom of nature of which we have
cognizance. But having said this, I am not prepared to
say how we are to perceive it in the animal kingdom,
though this North and South spindle line is shown in the
1

352 SYMBOLS RELEASED AND DYNAMIC
earliest forms of animal and plant life, and is
repeated
throughout the higher forms in embryonic life, while in the
mineral kingdom this posture expresses itself in lines of
cleavage.
1
In the vegetable kingdom it is
patent, as also in the
human kingdom. The erect posture is the posture of most
Men in the vegetable kingdom, and of all in the human
kingdom.
I am not prepared to deny that there are postures
other than this particular posture which I have described.
But this one is fundamental and entirely adequate to the
needs of all save those who may be working in the higher
reaches of the plane of Yoga.
The Only Safety I do not think there is
any more potent resolver of
ignorance, nor of the ills which come from ignorance to
every vehicle of consciousness, than this posture regularly
practised and caused to become vibrant with Reality. But
it has no effect whatever, or should I
say it has disastrous
effect, save as the physical body and other bodies of con-
sciousness are being actively purged of all dross. Purity is
safety. Coarseness is even more than danger. And it
cannot be too strongly insisted that the eating of meat and
the drinking of alcohol, as also smoking, make Yoga im-
possible, for they coarsen everything that is to be refined.
Anyone who tries to combine Yoga with these practices is
assured not only of failure but of producing results which
are the very antithesis of those which Yoga gradually
evokes. Hell is said to be paved with good intentions. It
is also paved with powers sought to be developed before
their time, that is to say, in defiance of the Law.

COLOUR-IDEAS AND JEWEL-IDEAS OF

Thus Vala [the demon, conqueror of Indra and His celestials]
yielded up his life for the good of the universe and the welfare of
the Gods, and behold, the severed limbs and members of his
sanctified body, became the seeds of gems . . . Then the Gods
and the Yakshas and the Siddhas and the Nagas eagerly rushed to
collect those precious seeds, and there were mighty flutterings of
celestial pinions and rustlings of celestial garments in heaven.

But there is little else, for my very highest consciousness
does not at all stretch anywhere near the lowest manifestation
of the Point as Point, if we may talk at all of manifestation.

I think I do not want to deduce anything. ! want to
be as sensitive as I
possibly can, to receive all I can, to
cause my own Being to be permeated as far as it can be
with the Positive-Negative of the Point.
I would also venture to make a suggestion as to the
jewels which are significant in connection with each symbol.
The Point . No- The Point, of course, can only be associated with what
one must call No-Stone. It is that synthesis which dissolves
all contributing elements into their collective essence. It
dissolves Sound into Silence, and Light into Darkness. It
dissolves Radiance into No-Radiance. It no less dissolves
jewels into No-Jewel.
The On the other hand, I seem to see the Point as

Stone associated with some precious stone or a material not
available to us down here. There are, of course, substances
we have yet to discover, and the jewel-substance associated
with the Point would seem to be one of these.

Lightning-
The lightning-white of the Consummation aspect of
the Point brings us to the recognition of a jewel which is
more-than-diamond. It
may well be of the diamond
nature, but it
occupies a place deeper in the No-Stone
octave than the diamond, for it is the very theme of this
octave. It is indeed more than lightning, and more than
white, even though I feel constrained to call it
lightning-
white in order to try to convey some sense of its nature.
But more than lightning-white it is No-Stone.

Jhe Garuda Parana describes at least two stones that commentators
prefer not to attempt to translate one is the Bhishma Stone, not a crystal,
but resembling a diamond. Also under Pearl, there is a heavenly variety
that obviously cannot be obtained on earth. See

For some strange reason I am unable to fathom 1
expect I have missed some vital fact it is not the diamond
that comes next in this octave at the head of which stands
the No-Stone. Next comes an amethyst-opal corruscation
the Forthgoing merging into the Web that is the Womb.
The amethyst appears to be a stone of protection or of
messengership. I find myself wondering if the amethyst be
the messenger-jewel in the jewel kingdom, the Mercury of
the Jewels.
In any case, its rich violet or purple colour connects it
with the spirit of Motherhood and Blessing, and it seems to
be of the nature of the Forthgoing and of the Web that is
the Womb which is the projection of the Forthgoing. First
the No-Stone. Then a corruscation of an amethystian
quality. Then, let us say, the amethyst. Then comes the
opal of the Web that is the Womb. I look upon the opal
as an incarnation of the amethyst, as the amethyst is an
incarnation of the No-Stone. And in each successive jewel,
the jewels which have gone before it are immanent, so that
inherent in the jewel of the Lotus are all the jewels of the
great line of unfoldment. Opalescent indeed is the Web
that is the Womb. And interestingly enough, the great
rolling of the Drums which is the sound of the evolutionary
process at work is to be heard almost as a gentle caress,
as the herald of the great envelopment which shall
draw into the Net of the Fisherman the Fish-Men for His
nourishing.
Now comes the diamond the vertical Line that is
born in the Womb of the Web. Forth it shoots, a flashing
piston-rod of electric fire, from out the very heart of the
being of the Web that is the Womb. Forth it shoots
upwards to the North, downwards to the South. It is silver-
blue, and has its direct relation with the No-Stone of the
Point in its aspect of Consummation. It is born of the
Web, but its power is as the power of the Point.

It is a Line of electric silver-blue, choosing as it were
this ray from the opal richness of the Web, and sounding
octave after octave of colour, octave after octave of music,
as it forms the perfect spindle, swelling at the centre,
tapering as it flashes to Northern and Southern Poles.
The nature of the Line is indeed this electric silver-blue.
Yet it robes itself in the octaves of colour and sound which
are to be the base of the impending evolutionary process.
This vertical Line is the Diamond.
Halting at its due extremities the Line enters what I
can only call a hush of briefest duration.
This vertical Line vibrates in terms of a sapphire
1
theme.
But after an instant of cosmic hush there flashes forth the
Circle topaz-yellow, and very child of our Lord the Sun in
His nature as God of a universe. Gazing upwards to Him
we perceive as shadow of the very Point itself in its aspect
of Forthgoing, and this Circle is He in incarnation, for it is
Globe no less than Circle.
The formation of the Line is succeeded immediately
by lightning flashes at the top and bottom, and round the
Line plays the Circle golden-yellow, with flashes, as it
seems to me, of gorgeous emerald-green. The Circle
emphasizes the topaz-theme in its golden-yellow richness,
though in some most beautiful way there is a blending of
the silver-blue, the golden-yellow, and in particular the
emerald-green : an opalescent effect reminiscent of the Web
that is the Womb. The Sea within the Circle emphasizes
the emerald-theme, and its Sea-content gives us the emerald.

"
will open barred
doors and dwellings (for the spirit of man) ; it produces a desire for prayer,
and brings with it more peace than any other gem ; but he who would wear
it must lead a pure and holy life
"
Now a series of investigations by
Amoretti into the electrical polarity of precious stones (which we find reported
in Kieser's Arch/a, Vol. IV, p. 62) resulted in proving that the diamond, the
garnet, the amethyst, are E, while the sapphire is 4-E. Orpheus tells how
by means of a loadstone a whole audience may be affected. Pythagoras,
whose knowledge was derived from India, pays a particular attention to the
colour and nature of precious stones ; and Apollonius of Tyana, one of the
purest and grandest men who ever lived, accurately taught his disciples the
various occult properties of gems. H. S. Olcott.

And then all becomes a Sea, with every colour flash-

though I am bound to say that the silver electric- blue
hardly seems a colour at all. It is a Mother-Spark scintillat-
ing down into countless hosts of flashing children.
And as I look upon this Sea, I
perceive it to be as a
Chakra, a Centre, within the Point which is its being.
Yes, it is a Chakra, a Centre, whirling unto its
purpose
and destiny. It whirls in spirals. Its heart is the Web that
is the Womb, and through this Web it receives the life of
the Point. And I see that it breathes with the Ceaseless
Breath of God, and that it radiates with the very radiance
of the Point out-turned.
It is a Lotus Seed. It becomes a Lotus Bud. It
spirals
upwards into a Lotus Flower.
In this Sea, this Chakra-Centre, comes the Cross which
is the mother of the Svastika. A horizontal Line appears,
rose-red in colour, again as I see it, and emphasizes the
theme of the ruby. It is the Line of Fecundation, as
the vertical Line is the Line of Vivification. Father and
Mother meet, and the Cross is born which becomes the
Svastika.
The Cross appears as a composite theme, as also does
the Svastika, and as such does not seem to give specific
jewels, partly because they already express the diamond
and the ruby, and partly because by their very nature they
are concerned with all the jewels. The Cross does not
appear to me merely as two Lines one electric silver-blue,
the other rose-red. It seems to be shot with golden-yellow
and with emerald-green, while the opal of the Web shim-
mers against the background of the No-Stone Point.
Then the Svastika a veritable swirl of colour of inde-
scribable beauty, but with silver-blue, golden-yellow, emerald-
green, and rose-red definitions a magnificent corruscation
of flashing jewels of colour. And it whirls against the

iridescence of the Web which itself has the pervading
background of the Point which is the All and the None.
At last, in Consummation, the Lotus Flower fulfilment,
glorification, of the Svastika. White ? Yes, if I
may call it
lightning-white, or rather in comparison with the Point, the
mother-hue of white. Not any white as we may know
white, certainly not milk-white. Yet a white which ex-
presses the consummation of all the colours, the Con-
summation of the evolutionary process.
The Jewel ? The Unknown Jewel we have yet to
discover.
And I see now that in a certain way this lightning-
white is an aspect of the Point viewed in a measure of its
unveiling. If words are to be used at all in connection with
that which is indescribable by any forms, we may perhaps
think of a lightning-white about which play opalescences,
as often on a warm clear night lightning flashes and plays
here and there in the sky.
There is all the Silence and all the Darkness, all that is
more than any all we know down here. But if at all we
measure with words the immeasurable, as a concession to
human craving for form, the best I can do is this vague
cloud of lightning-white about which shimmers an opale-
scence. But I feel how utterly inadequate this is, and little
short of a desecration.
I have suggested that the Forthgoing, shining in the
Web of opalescence, is accompanied by the rollirtg-caress
of great Drums. I
say
" caress
"
because I feel a sense, I
hear a sense, of enfoldment, of rounding, of encircling, and
then, by way of translation into more homely terms, a pro-
tecting, a mothering. The rolling is as the ceaseless waves
of the sea, billow upon billow.
1
Let us try to lose ourselves in that mighty apotheosis of
Silence as the Drums cease their rolling. That Silence, that

rebound from the rolling of the Drums, is the Point in its
aspect of Consummation. The Drums roll sweepingly
through an age of evolution, never ceasing from the very
outset of the Forthgoing. Richer and richer in tone and
colour become their cadencies, more thundering and com-
pelling, almost cataclysmic, often catastrophic, stormy,
peaceful, but ever moving onwards to their divinely ap-
pointed end.
And then the King Is crowned. He becomes a God,
God.
The Drums cease.
And in the aftermath of their cessation, in that Silence
which indeed is more than Sound, infinitely more, the King-
God enters that Samadhi of No-Number, of No-Sound, of
No-Form, of No-Colour, of No-Radiance, enters what we
call a Pralaya, but which to me is in fact an Anointing for
an Exaltation which even colours and sounds are entirely
inadequate to describe.
We do not truly speak of Rest at any time in these
regions of Ultimate Realities. I do not think we can speak
of Rest in any regions. But well may we speak of Anoint-
ings, of Dedications, of the opening by the magic of
unheard-of Forces of Gateways to Beyonds wherein No-lsis
dwells enshrined.
Pralaya is not Rest. It is not a waiting. It is a Re-
creation, an Anointing in very truth.
Thus do I
say Lightning-White, when in reverence I
ought, perhaps, to say naught. Thus do I
say the Silence
of the Ceasing of the Drums. Thus do I
say Opalescence.
Thus do I
say the rolling-caress of great Drums.
I cannot say more, though somewhere there is a more
for which neither words, nor forms, nor colours, nor sounds,
nor silence, nor darkness, avail.
And here is an octave of manifestation :

There are very many ways in which it is
possible to
epitomize or otherwise to symbolize a complex idea. Each
of us, according to his own individual uniqueness, will use
one or another of the ways. For myself, in thinking of a
Man, at whatever stage of his evolution, I think of a many-
faceted crystal or of the particular gem or jewel to which
I deem him to belong.
I
perceive within that crystal-jewel a central Sun, the
Sun of his Eternal Individuality, which shines through the
crystal as a whole and through each of its facets. I often
see people around me in this way. I see the colours of
their jewel-glories, I hear the sounds of their growing, and
I
perceive the building of their forms. I see their Suns
within them, drops of glory from the shining of our Lord
the Sun.

In a particular incarnation the Sun shines through one
facet alone, though, of course, there is an overshadowing
in some degree by the whole, by all the facets, by the
light that shines through all of them. How strange it is
that so many of us down here, most of us, deduce the
whole of ourselves from the one single facet through which
our Sun is but dimiy shining. We are but shadows of
shades. Yet we deem ourselves the whole realities of our
Selves. How proud we must all be ! How ignorant ! And
how insignificant a conception of the Whole of each of us
each one of us has.
My jewel, so far as I can at present see, is the
Diamond, the stone which by its
very name is supposed to
convey the idea of the love of God. But for this particular
physical incarnation of adjustment, the adjusting stone is
Jade. Perhaps my readers are thinking of their own preci-
ous stones. It is well that they should seek them and
draw through them the Light of God.
In the Ratna Shastras there is much valuable material
regarding the kings of the mineral kingdom as precious stones
are. If we are able to contact our kingship in these mineral
regions, we shall in all
probability be the more accurately able
to determine the nature of our approaching kingship in the
human kingdom, and perhaps also to trace our kingship in
the vegetable and animal kingdoms. What is the diamond in
the vegetable, in the animal, in the human kingdom ?
In any case, this crystal with its central Sun is the
very Monad of ourselves, whence are derived what is called
the Ego or Individuality and its dependant, the Personality.
In this book on Yoga I have more or less identified the
Monad with what I have everywhere called the Individuality,
There is the Monad-Individuality. There is its reflection in
the changing Ego. There is the periodically incarnating
Personality, the Mask which the Ego changes time after
time for the purposes of its growth.

Their schemes are all

comes, each offers his plan ... as the fruit of his brain, which he
lays before the Lord ... a sacrifice for the sake of the Logos.

I have been trying to see how the use of colours may
smoothen the way of the student of Yoga please note
that I
emphatically do not say
" the Yogi," for we are not
likely, any of us, to be actual Yogis for a long time
to come.
Esoterically, for example, the earth seems to be green
in colour. Therefore, if we would help the earth or any
life upon it, there must be a green tinge to our offering,
whatever other colours we may use to meet special needs.
If we wish for Peace, or for Disarmament, or for some
special Relief to enfold an area of need, we should think a
green thought, or rather a thought tinged with emerald.
This will induce receptivity and healing. Those who have
at heart Causes which they believe will help the world to
happiness should, when directly working upon them, either
in the activity of work on the physical plane or in the

activity of meditation, suffuse them with the purest of
emerald-green. The introduction of other colours will
depend upon the nature of the Cause and the need it is
designed to satisfy.
If an individual is to be helped, green may always be
used in safety, though again the addition of other colours
will depend upon the actual need. A green thought-
form may always be used whatever the colour of the
life within.
But each day has its individual colour. So the use of
a colour on the day to which that colour belongs will
intensify the strength and purity of the colour, and possibly
link it to extra-terrestrial forces. Each day has also its
note, and in sending forth our help we can, therefore, utilize
sound as well as colour. If we have the necessary training
we may imbed in our thought-form a miniature symbol as
its heart, choosing the symbol according to the nature of
the service to be rendered.

When we add to our normal five senses the two
which are yet to come the inner sense of colour and the

inner sense of sound we shall have at our disposal forces
far more potent than at present we can even dream.
I have no doubt that an intuitive astrologer could
work out months and also years in terms of their respective
colours and sounds.
It would be both interesting and profitable to know in
what different colour-and-sound-and-form ways the months
and years are at our special disposal. I think that we could
be much more effective in our help were we able to use
the colour of the year to aid our philanthropic work.
But as the world is at present, such knowledge is not
available, for Men are still much more men than Gods,
and use their powers for selfishness rather than for service.
I feel I have already gone as far as I
ought in sug-
gesting the use of colours and sounds, for where one
individual will use the knowledge in the service not only of
his fellow-men but also of his brother-Men in other king-
doms of nature, there will be a hundred who will seek to
turn the blessings of God to selfish ends.
Those who are ready to begin the Path of Yoga will
for themselves discover the powers they have become fit
to wield. The others must wait until they know Life's
lessons more by heart and by will rind less by mind.

For the moment I am specially thinking of the letters

of what may be their actual colours or sounds, but of the
colour-and-sound endowment we can give to them.
Most potent magic can be released even if we can
do no more than in our own minds to associate certain
colours and sounds with the vowels of an alphabet to start
with, and afterwards with every other letter as well.
If we can do this to some small extent, and then use
our Yoga to reinforce such sounds and colours, not only
can we construct in ourselves a great power of healing, but
also a great power of combing out tangled vibrations,

howsoever these may have arisen from quarrelling, from
hatreds, from irritabilities, from misunderstandings, and
other disharmonies.
To be truly scientific, especially from the occult point
of view, it
might be necessary to study with great care the
actual relations between the various letters of the alphabet
and the sound and colour scales, and we should have to
try to discover the whole cosmic or inner meaning of an
alphabet, trying to listen to its raga, its motif, its
symphonic
picture.
Language is derived from Life, is an expression of
Life. Its constituent words express the varying modes of
Life, divided as these may be into the great threefold
division of Will, Wisdom and Activity. Similarly there are
the words which depend from these three principal divisions.
For example, the words of the higher and the lower mind,
and of the intuition, are words dependent from Wisdom.
Similarly there are the words of emotion and of feeling
which largely depend from the Activity aspect ; inasmuch
as they suggest towards or away from, they are essentially
words of movement, while the words of the mind are more
words of analysis and synthesis.
It would be very interesting to be able to classify the
words of a language into their respective divisions, and if
! wished to be a little bolder still, I should like to try to
classify words according to their Rays. After all, Language
is Life, and must have the characteristics of Life.
It is especially interesting to me, in connection with
Symbolic Yoga to think of the letter
" I" as indicating the
individual or individuality,

also in its aspect as a vertical Line
reminding us of what is the primordial birth in the marriage
of the symbols I have described. The Point gives birth to

gives birth to the vertical Line, the "
I," and there is this
birth that immediately sets going a new evolutionary pro-
cess, and is the direct means whereby the innumerable
" I's
"
within the Sea of Undifferentiation start on their Self-
conscious way. I think there must be something more
than a coincidence in this.
Another question I
might ask : What individual part do
the vowels, the life-element of a word, play in the language
of a people ? Why, for example, does the " oo
"
sound run
through the Aryan tongues as expressive of the second
person singular, while we note the " ee
"
sound in the
Dravidian and Chinese tongues, perhaps derived from
Atlantean heritage ?
I am very clear that while there is a common back-
ground for all component parts of all
languages, each part
has its own unique significance, according as to whether
the language is Samskrit, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi,
Urdu, German, French, English, Dutch, Italian, and so on.
There is a common essence, of course. But I am sure
there are distinct shades of meaning varying as the language
varies, and therefore as the class varies in the world school.
The understanding of the symbols of this form of Yoga
will vary according to the nationality, according to the f^fch,
according to the individual idiosyncrasies of the students.
And this is all to the good, for without differences there
can be no solidarity.
I want to take advantage of the existence of such
differences to urge each reader to express his own differ-
ence in terms of colour and sound, both in the words
he uses and in his application of the symbols to such
words. For I believe that part of the Yoga consists, as it
were, in harnessing the spirits of the symbols to a number of
modes of self-expression, in particular to letters of the
alphabet, to words and to phrases, with the aid of colour
and of sound. I should be very glad, therefore, if each

reader were to be able to identify for himself a specific
colour and a specific sound with each symbol, so that he ac-
quired the habit of associating definite sounds and colours
with the symbols as he uses them.
It must be clearly understood that these symbols are
for use, and not just to be looked at. They must be used
so that the student merges himself in each as occasion
seems to demand, as circumstances evoke one or another,
and in a very positive way becomes the symbol, breathing
forth the very soul of it.
A student who can even to a certain extent do this
will then be able to use the symbols in and through all
kinds of media, including letters of the alphabet, words,
phrases, objects of all kinds, and in particular through
denizens of the various kingdoms with whom he may be
specially en rapport.
I
urge that words and all other modes of expression
be made colour-ful and rich in sound, so that the smallest
concomitants of our daily lives themselves become sound-ful
and colour-ful. Life is little else is it
anything else ? save
colour and sound and form, for in Father-Mother Sun, the
Supreme Lord of Colour and of Sound and of Form for this
universe, we live and move and have the very whole of our
being.
A student of this form of Yoga may well occupy part
of his time for study in constructing for himself an alphabet
of sounds and an alphabet of colours, and include in it the
extraordinarily rich literature of sound in the musical works
of the great Masters of Sound, and of colour in the paint-
ings of the great Masters of Colour ; and no less in the
great works of architecture and of sculpture of the great
Masters of Form. Though in reality, of course, sounds,
colours and forms are one and indivisible on an ultimate
plane. (See

it is the formula for totality, the Alpha and Omega of exist-

There is no truer truth obtainable
By man, than comes of Music. Browning
I sketched a little piece of music
l
for my personal con-
venience as a means of helping to bridge the gulf between
an inner and an outer Yoga. It is written for the pianoforte,
but I have added a few suggestions in this text for possible
orchestration, since the piano is
utterly inadequate to give
expression to that Real within me, that music of myself, of
which the composition is but a feeble and specific reflection.
The music, while appropriate to me personally, may
not at all suit any other builder of bridges between the
inner and the outer worlds. It fulfils my individual require-
ments for such a channel, so far as my musical frailty
permits me to build. It does supply some of the material
necessary for the building, and other material, as will be
seen, is
supplied by a group of Deva friends.
The theme-sketch opens with such reproduction as (
am able to manage of those lofty, cosmic thunder-sounds
which permeate all life. These thunder-sounds constitute
the Damru roll so wonderfully depicted in the ancient
Hindu Scriptures. But even with real drums the effect
must needs be infinitely poor.

The scale is that of G, for G is
my own note, and I
could use no other for any personal affairs. The thunder-
motif should be played with slow, deep majesty, the rich-
ness of each note being reproduced by great sensitivity of
touch each note being caressed to its perfect expression.
There should be no sense of
"
striking
"
either of note or
of chord, but rather of a magic conjuring and release of
sound.
The thunder-notes die away, releasing just one touch
of semi-discord to break the Silence and the Darkness of
the Cosmic Drums. In orchestration I should like both basses
and violincellos to play the melody, with here and there a
touch of the cymbal, especially at the point of the discord.
The ensuing short melody mainly for violins con-
stitutes a kind of dipping down from heaven to earth, to
evoke an act of Reverence. Thus follows the motif of
Consecration the response of man to his Higher Self.
Violas and violins may be introduced here. And the effect
should be that of straining, eager yearning. In a somewhat
different form this motif is
reproduced a little later, and the
passage concludes with an unresolved Offering suggesting
that all true offering is ceaseless.
A little echo thrills through the world, for the offering
of one is an offering from all, and flutes and oboes should
be used to help to give an effect of flowing water clear,
rhythmic, limpid.
With this prelude, this laying of foundations, as it
were, the time has come for the invocation to the Angels
or Devas, that they may help to build as they alone can
build. The notes E Bb are well-known notes of Deva
invocation and Deva music generally, and a ripple of sound
is added as part of the pure material for their building.
Then a pause, and then comes the Response, the
Assent to the building, from Those who are in authority over
Angels. Instantly reacting to the permission, a group of

There is a peculiar relationship between this chord and the

The channel is ready, and through it, now to the
heights from below, now from the heights downwards, flows
the Yoga force, making that Union, which is the very mean-
ing of the word "
Yoga."
Each student of Yoga should, of course, build his own
music bridge with the material of his own uniqueness. And
there are innumerable bridges. This Yoga of Sound is
only one bridge among very many.
* x * *
It
may be helpful to some students of Yoga if
they make
use of some musical instrument to aid them in gathering
together their experiences for the process of sublimation.
They might sound it to its utmost capacity at both extremities
of its range, and then with the aid of the imagination carry
the sound still farther in themselves. The same may be
done in terms of colour, even reaching the black, which is
not the denial of colour but the affirmation of its slowest
motion in manifestation. Is black but white in slow motion?
The same may be done, not only in terms of forms,
but in terms of the extension of them, again with the aid
of the imagination, to their infinities, or rather to such
limits as each individual student is able to reach.
It is an interesting experiment, for example, to take a
musical motif, or raga, and first to expand it to its utmost
expression, once more with the aid of the imagination, so
that it seems almost to expand into infinity, and then to
contract it to its Point of infinite concentration or as near to
this as the student can approximate.

Some experience having been gained in this, the
musical student then proceeds to do the same with some
definite composition, while the really deep student of music
will try to do the same with a symphony or an opera.
A colour-scheme and a form-scheme may be treated
in exactly the same way.
In the various Heaven-worlds of colour, music and
form, wherein are archetypes and apotheoses, a whole
opera, indeed a whole cycle of operas, will find expression
in an ecstasy of one single note ; a wealth of colour, a
marvel of form-structure, in an ecstasy of a single line
each a Point with indescribable intimations of radiance.
The genius-artist, the genius-musician, the genius-
builder of forms, draws down into himself these Points,
expands out of them a cradle Web, whence flashes forth a
motif Line, wherefrom he builds his creation in a Circle-
Globe, gives it life in Cross and Svastika, and lifts it
up as
Lotus offering in homage to the Heaven whence it came.
The same experience may be attempted with some
feeling, emotion or thought, with some aspiration, with
some mode of seeking. These may be reduced to their
Point essentials and to their Lotus expansions so far as the
student is able to go.
He may take a feeling or an emotion of reverence,
reduce it to a reverence-seed, unfold it to a Reverence-
bud, expand it to a Reverence- Lotus Flower, fulfil it in a Point
of Reverence.
It is thus that we are often able to make an individual
affection or reverence, confined to a single object, a start-
ing-point for an intimate sense of brotherhood with all life.
Yoga is Union. Yoga is the great bridge between
Man and his Godhead, between the One and His many
the many which are in the One between the beginning
and the end of every age of experience.

being conducted by
a great musician, and some of the most gorgeous music,
relayed from the Heaven of Music through a master-chan-

Aurora Borealis is a thought from our 'Lord the Sun, so
will the symbol a thought of the Eternal Life thrill

Heaven, and with which he helps to make a heaven of
earth.

Perchance the music may cause me to remember the
Line, that Piston-Rod of Power, ceaselessly descending into
matter, ceaselessly ascending into spirit. The music may be
the music of the Line. In such music do heaven and earth
unite, and in the very hall itself, through human agency
enriched by non-human choirs, the world is lifted up into
heaven because the magic of human genius has conjured
heaven down to earth. Down pours the Line horn Heaven.
Up pours the Line from Earth.
In my Yoga I

How many of you have ever heard the Cosmic Drums,

The Point is represented by the stillness to be disen-
tangled from the rolling Drums. I wonder whether in a
deep meditation you could hear the rolling of the Drums,
and perceive within that rolling the Silence which is the
very background and origin of it.

When we come to the Web-Womb, the rolling Drums
assume a caressing note. There is a sense of unfoldment,
the Drums of immanent Compassion.
When we come to the Line, there is, as it were, the
beginning of the focussing of the Drum-motif upon an
evolutionary process-to-be. There one enters into extreme
difficulties, because the rolling Drums have to give birth
to the Sound of the universe, and not only to the Sound
but to the Symbol of the universe. How that is done I
do not know.
I do not wish to suggest that there is an actual drum
which is beaten. It is the kind of full rich darkness of the
beating of drums. I am trying to arrive at the darkness of
the drum-rhythm. Those who play the Drums in the higher
realms play with their very being.
A curious thing, for the moment I can only hear the
crescendo, the gradual increase in intensity of the Drums
of Nemesis.
The real Drum, the sound of which you hear on the
higher planes, is the Drum of Life, but it varies in its
majesty. While always maintaining the eternal roll, that
roll varies. A subtle difference takes place according to
what may be a dominant need of the world at the time, so
that you may hear an emphasis on the Drums of Relentless
Power. Those you do in fact hear all the time they are
the great Sounds which keep evolution moving.
Why drums ? Because the drums are the only im-
personal instruments. All other instruments are personal,
with their own individualities, singing their own melody, but
the drums are above melody, above harmony.
According to the dominant need of the world, so is a
subtle difference introduced into this cosmic beating, this
cosmic rolling. There is
nothing to compare it with down
here. We shall be able to perceive the nature of the
Drum if we try, in our meditation or in any Yoga we may

perform, to contact those rolling Drums which are just as
much within us as without. They are rolling, beating,
vibrating within us no less than outside.
1
We can hear a
Drum in a flower or in a jewel. It is
easy to hear the Drum
in the thunder, the lightning and the storm. We have
perhaps seen or sensed those Devas with their streaming
hair, and with their whole appearance of lightning intensity,
blazing to and fro in their slim bodies with skin entirely
radiant and eyes of tawny and golden hues. The
streaming hair seems a part of the very body, and we
see them playing about magnificently in storms. If we
cannot see them, let us try to imagine them.
Apart from the all-permeating of that resistless one
would like almost to say relentless power, there are two
other elements which we perceive, knowing thereby all is
safe. Even though we may be immensely preoccupied by
the world-situation, it is within the rolling of the Drums.
First, as I have said, there is the spirit of relentless
power, so perfect and omnipresent that we have the Christian
phrase :
"
Vengeance is Mine, saith the Lord, I will repay."
The perfect rhythm of the Drums in Heaven fills all the
earths with its resistless adjustment. It would seem as if
every manifestation of Life at any time is in some way an
incarnation of these Divine Drums, which are the sounds of
growth, just as we might perceive, if we could, the colours
of growth no less. Indeed, as I have been pointing out,
seeing and hearing are in truth interchangeable factors.
We must be able to see sounds and to hear colours, to
hear colours in the rhythm of the Drums and to see sounds
in the flashing of the rainbow. The rainbow Drums are
as to colour as the sound Drums are as to sound. I wish
I could make myself more clear, but the perception involved
is so very much within, and defies externalization.

One can faintly hear these throbbing drum-like sounds by closing the
ears with the first fingers of either hand.

Then there is the spirit of boundless compassion which
gives to relentlessness its cosmic value. Relentless power
yes. But with God, with One who has achieved the spirit
of the Point, the glory of the relentlessness, which with us
might well be called a Nemesis, or a vengeance of a ruthless
nature, is
pure and perfect compassion.
Thus these Drums have a twofold nature relentless
power and boundless compassion.
If
only we will hear them. We can. Both Drum-
qualities are within us. If we will only break through the
personal element, we can reach them, and we must break
through all our recognized limitations. If
anyone says :
" I cannot," the Drums will not be heard by him. If
any-
one says :
"
I will try," the Drums may be heard by him.
Most people living in the smaller self say :
" I
cannot, I can-
not, I
cannot," and they do not or will not Let us use our
imagination and use our Self. Assuredly, there is
nothing
more magnificent in heaven or in earth than this cease-
less rolling.
Let us listen to the rolling of the waves. That may per-
haps be our ante -chamber. We can intensify and magnify
for ourselves the sea-waves constantly beating upon the
shore. That brings us into comparatively immediate
contact with the Reality, because the waves, like the drums,
are impersonal.
Again, the Samskrit language is nearest to the rolling
of the drums, and is, therefore, the most beautiful. The
Samskrit language is the drum-language, and if it can be
chanted as the drum sounds, with the impersonal variations
that are appropriate, thereby can we enter into these Realities.

The word drum itself is
good, almost an onomatopoeic
word. To aid in this world-situation, we do not need
to be damming this, or against that. If we can get into
the spirit of the relentless power, compassion and perfect
impersonality that is needed for channels of the Drums, we
need not be against a living soul, we merely need to
assert the Drums.
Only one thing I would say : these Drums are alive
with Silence. Perhaps we are already perceiving how
silent they are. Even though they be Drums of Sound,
they reflect the Silences and Darknesses of Life. There-
fore, we have to learn to be silent. Energy is frittered
away in needless talk, and we cannot get near the
Drums unless we have learned to speak with the Voice
of the Silence. If
people would only have little
"
silences
"
together instead of chats, how they would grow ! While the
tongue wags, the Drums cannot be heard, because the click
of the tongue is
cacophanous as compared with the music of
the Drums. The more one talks, the less one knows. Even
that which one does know may be taken away, if one talks
too much. With talk one imprisons and loses Reality. It is
more important to be than to talk. It is
dangerous to talk.
But we should always remember that the Drums of
relentless power and of boundless compassion are rolling
through each of us, and the more we listen to them, the
more we cannot help hearing them, until they become
constantly sounding in our ears. The Drums of Life's
Eternal Meaning are sounding, vibrating piston-like up and
down the spine,
1
in the heart, in the current of Kundalini,
because Kundalini is a sound as well as a colour, a sound-
drum as well as a colour-drum.
It is when we are conscious channels for the Drums
that we are beginning to become real servants of the
Hierarchy, because the Drums are Theirs and God's.

I wish I could dig deep enough into Man's conscious-
ness at its various stages of unfoldment, through what are
called the Kingdoms of Nature what is nature but
man ? so as to perceive the working of what we call the
Laws of Nature, which are, of course, nothing but the Laws
of Man the Rhythms of Man, as I should prefer to desig-
nate them.
The idea of a Law involves the conception of a Neces-
sity,
a ruthless and resistless Necessity. And while I believe
in such Necessity, I feel sure that it is
self-imposed, that
Man imposes upon himself his own Necessity, manipulating
it in a spirit of Freewill. The very nature of Man is his
Necessity. His greatest Necessity is his nature, his natural-
ness. He cannot escape himself. He cannot escape his
Divinity. His unfoldment to his Godhead is his Necessity,
but his freedom lies, within the limitations of his self-imposed
Necessity, in modes and duration of such unfoldment.
But if we think of Rhythms instead of using the word
"
Law," so liable to be misunderstood, we shall more
accurately perceive the conditions under which unfoldment

Nature ?
First, it should be clear that all Rhythms, all Laws, are
pulsations of the Ceaseless Breath.
1
There is
certainly a
Something more subtle even than this Ceaseless Breath,
Something of which the Ceaseless Breath is but a reflection.
But of this Subtlety we can have no conception at our stage
of unfoldment. For us the Rhythm or Law of the Cease-
less Breath is
surely not only one of the Ultimates, but
perchance even the Ultimate.
I shall not hesitate to say that it is the Rhythm both of
Movement and of Movementlessness. It is the substans
of THAT. Where rhythm is stilled to its uttermost, is at its
slowest, there remains Ceaseless Breath, even though the
vacuum seems almost complete. Where rhythm is
infinitely
vibrant, there is the Ceaseless Breath.
It is the rhythm that pervades every one of the sym-
bols used in this form of Yoga. They depend upon it. It
is their Life. It is their Being, their Essence, their Alpha
and Omega. In each of the symbols the Ceaseless Breath
pulsates at its divine rate of vibration.
Among the rhythms dependent upon this Ultimate of
the Ceaseless Breath, I
give first place, and for obvious
reasons, to the Rhythm of Existence, the most important
characteristic of which is its Ceaseless Breath.
It is Outflow and ft is Inflow it outflows to its
circumference, whatever and wherever that may be, it in-
flows to its centre, again whatever or wherever this may be.
I often think, as I have said before, of the jellyfish as an
admirable example of the Ceaseless Breath within an in-
dividuality, in terms of Life. It seems to breathe with the
whole of itself. It is, as it were, one whole breathing
or breath. This is what all individualities are, even though
they may not so appear. Each individuality breathes

ceaselessly with the whole of itself, whatever may actually
be its
organs of breathing. And neither death nor life can
affect the ceaselessness of breathing.
And ceaselessly, too, this breath is at work, is function-
ing, in every state of consciousness. A thought is a breath-
ing. A feeling is a breathing. An emotion is a breathing.
An aspiration is a breathing. A sorrow is a breathing,
often dominantly a series of sharp breath-in-takes. Ac-
tions are breathings. Each of these is an out-breathing
to some point, followed by an inbreathing to a reservoir.
Every state of consciousness is a movement between a
centre and a circumference, is an outgoing, and therefore
an ingoing, breath.
I sum up the essential implication of this rhythm,
the Rhythm of Existence, by saying that Life is.
I
give second place to the Rhythm of Unity, which
perhaps needs no other description than to say that Life
is One.
I
give third place to the Rhythm of Universality, of
Life as universal, the rhythm most interestingly expressed
in certain of its differences in the three higher states of
consciousness which are more or less within our cognizance.
This rhythm may be expressed in the words : Life is
Everywhere.
I wish I could have rightly given my first four rhythms
as follows :
1. Life is.
2. Life is One.
3. Life is
Everywhere.
4. Life is Movement.
But I could not do this, for somehow the Rhythm of
Movement seems in quite an incomprehensible way
anterior to Life itself. Movement would seem to be more
than Life, though, of course, Life is Movement. It is
necessary for me, therefore, to give priority of place to
388 SYMBOLS RELEASED AND DYNAMIC
Monadic,
Nirvanic,
Buddhic Planes
Not lost but

The One into

Many
The Triangle
that wonderful conception of being which is described in
the words "
Ceaseless Breath."
Reverting to the Rhythm of the Universality of Life,
we find a threefold expression of this in what are called in
Theosophical terminology the Monadic, the Nirvanic and
the Buddhic plane. There is on the Monadic plane the
expression of pure Universality, or, let me suggest, Every-
whereness. One stage below there is the rhythm ex-
pressed in terms of the Infinity, the many enfolded in the
One, and the One pulsating both in terms of the Cease-
less Breath and of the expression of that Ceaseless Breath
in its mode of Life. It is so impossible to describe these
states of consciousness with form-words, that I wonder if I
shall be understood when I
say that in this state of con-
sciousness there is that radiance which returns the many
to the One.
It will be seen here how the false idea of Annihilation
has come into usage. In understanding the true nature of
Nirvana, it has been thought that when an individuality
merges in a Universality, the individuality is lost. It Is not
lost. It is fulfilled. And a veritable merging takes place
between Individuality and Universality with results far
beyond the power of description. Of individuality in this
state of consciousness it will be very true to say
"
not lost,
but gone before." I must leave the reader to try to
understand this cryptic statement. Thus on the Nirvanic
plane is
expressed one aspect of the pure Universality
of Life.
Then there is the rhythm of the One projected forth
into the infinite many, this expressing the second aspect of
Pure Universality on the Buddhic plane.
Thus we have a perfect triangle with the Monadic
consciousness at the apex and these two aspects of it at
either end of the base. I
must, however, point out that
this is true only from one point of view, since while the

! found my
One in all the
Many
Monadic consciousness is at the apex, the Nirvanic and
Buddhic consciousnesses succeed one another in a direct
line of descent, the former taking incarnation in the latter,
Within, therefore, this Rhythm of Universality, of Life
as Everywhere, dependent as this rhythm is
upon its
pre-
decessor Lite is One, we perceive first the reflection of this
latter rhythm in all its purity on the Monadic plane as it
descends downwards, then the rhythm of the Many in the
One, and then the rhythm of the One in the Many. On
lower planes of consciousness there is, as it were, a play
upon these three relatively primordial states. The plane of
the Mind reflects all three. The plane of the Emotions
reflects all three. The Physical plane reflects all three.
But we may look upon this rhythm from another
point of view, not from above downwards, but from below
upwards :
I remember many years ago sitting on the veranda
in an hotel in Taormina (Sicily).
I was gazing aimlessly
over the orange grove beneath, and into the distances of
the sapphire-blue Mediterranean Sea. Suddenly I found
myself projected into a particular orange tree below, I
found myself living in that orange tree. I was the orange
tree, yet had I contact with myself. A gardener came
along and plucked some of me away. I felt a loss. I had
become less in some entirely incomprehensible way. I had
ceased somehow to be a fulfilment. I had ceased to be
complete. And a restlessness stole over me, so that there
had to be a renewal of an urge. Of course, I could not
understand all this, in my capacity as an orange tree. As
the tree I could only sense the need of a more, not even
the need for a beginning again. A less had taken the place
of a more, A more must take the place of the less.
But I could understand this as my consciousness
flashed back out of the tree into my human self. And I
could particularly understand that the evolutionary distance
390 SYMBOLS RELEASED AND DYNAMIC
The One of all
Ones
The Stillness of
Life
The Heart of
Rhythm
between my human self and the self of the tree was really
only a matter of time, not a matter of actual consciousness
itself. The consciousness of the tree was less, but the
same as mine in quality in every respect. Realizing this, I
found I could project myself into every living thing around
me, into trees and flowers, into animals, into the earth, the
rocks, the stones, and the sea itself. I found my One in
all the many.
Such is an aspect of the Buddhic consciousness. Many
years later, in the course of a meditation, I found that not
only could I
project myself into the many, but that the
many could be resolved into my One. Instead of my
going forth into the orange tree, into the trees and flowers,
into animals, into the earth, the rocks, the stones, the sea, all
these could come to me and be one with me. And I and
all of them could merge into the One of all ones. The
two experiences are the same from one point of view, but
very different from another.
And then there is neither going forth nor entry.
There is a stillness uniting both. There is just Life, with no
need, as it were, to use any qualifications such as
"
every-
where." It is Life.
This is one aspect, but only one, of what is called the
Nirvanic consciousness.
As Man learns more and more to become a rhythm
unto himself, to grow without the need of the crutches of
outer sanctions, he begins to discover that that rhythm
which he Is to himself is the rhythm everywhere, though
the "
everywhere
"
may by no means yet be conscious of
the fact. Having begun to become a rhythm unto him-
self, he thus enters, or rather moves outwards, into the
eternal spirit or heart of Rhythm everywhere, and gains
flashes and later on a permanent light from the Buddhic state
of consciousness, the state of consciousness which opens out
to him the third of the truths of the Universality of Life.
THE RHYTHMS OF MAN 391
All Rhythms are
Within
The Rhythm of

law, Light, Life
As he continues his growth, Man begins to learn of
the ineffable mystery that all
rhythms are within him, and
he and all are within the One Rhythm. Simultaneously,
as it were, all Life flows into him, the One becomes his
One, and he flows into all Life, his One becoming the
One. He gains the understanding that there is but the
One Life everywhere, and that all individualities are with-
in that One Life. Thus does he gain flashes of the
Nirvanic state of consciousness, the state of consciousness
which opens out to him the second of the truths of the
Universality of Life.
Passing out of the human kingdom
altogether, Light (Nirvana) becomes the waking state of his
consciousness, as the principle of Rhythm as Law, Order
and Purpose (Buddhi) should so become as he enters the
final heights of the human kingdom itself.
Thus the Rhythm of Universality is a very near ap-
proach to those infinitely lofty regions which must needs be
entirely outside our reach for many millenia.
But I must quickly give next place to the Rhythm of
Individuality, for from the higher aspects of consciousness
there is little, if
anything at all, to choose between Universal-
ity and Individuality, and I have already been assuming
Individuality.
Individuality is
Universality writ microscopically. Look
through one end of the spiritual telescope and you will see
Universality. Look through the other end and you will see
Individuality. And yet the Individual, the Man, is
unique,
is an eternal Himself, and never loses his Individuality,
however much it
may become merged in
Universality.
The Individuality, becoming a Law unto himself, dis-
covers that there is the same Law in all. The Individuality,
the One, journeying forth into the many to find his Law in
them all, goes on to discover that there is the same Light
in all, that he is that Light, and that that Light itself is the
shining of the Universal Life.

But how does the Individuality grow nto the knowl-
edge of Universal Law and Universal Light ? How does he
learn to become a Law unto himself ?
There are other rhythms of his Being which slowly,
gradually, but undeviatingly, change him into the required
Self-consciousness. I cannot give these rhythms in the
order either of their importance or their operation. The
reader must sort them out for himself.
There is the Rhythm of Obedience, which is the I
should say
"
a
"
reflection of the Rhythm of the Universal
Life and of all
Individuality within such Life.
We are obedient to ourselves, from the earliest
kingdoms right to the very end, seeking to be more and
more obedient even in our anarchies and rebellions, in our
revolutions and challenging denials, until we discover that
in perfect obedience to Law and Light and Life lies our
highest freedom
In the earliest states of consciousness there is un-
conscious realization of this truth, for Obedience and
Freedom are one, as they ever are on the heights. In
the middle states of consciousness, as in most regions of
the human kingdom, the two that are one become two,,
and recede one from the other to opposite poles, and now
one, now the other, gains ascendancy. Freedom, grossly
misconceived as it is, is for the moment the shibboleth of
Men in the earlier reaches of the human kingdom, and
civilization is often said to be characterized by freedom.
Perhaps this freedom may from one point of view be
regarded as obedience to the fleeting self, while true
freedom lies in obedience to the Self Eternal. Be this as
it may, at last Man reaches Obedience, and through it
discovers the Law, the Light and the Life of Being.
Instinct is an aspect of the Rhythm of Obedience,
for God gives us instinct until He can awaken in us
intuition.

The Rhythm of
Insatiability
The Insatiability
of Electricity
The Rhythms of
Acceleration
and
Retardation
Then there is the Rhythm of Insatiability, of ever-
hungriness. Within the seed vibrates the extraordinary
Rhythm of Insatiability which insists on expansion into bud
and flower, and then into self-reproduction. From more
to more each Individuality must inevitably grow. The grass
and the flowers and the trees vibrate with insatiability as
the birds seek them and as the winds caress them. In the
earthquake, the hurricane and the eternal restlessness, is
the response of God to the challenging insatiability of earth
and stone and rock. In the eager curiosity of the newly-
born animal is the Rhythm of Insatiability at work, and the
very lives of the older creatures are not merely quests for
food, but unconscious urgings of this Rhythm of Insatiability,
which might well be called the Rhythm of Restlessness. In-
man the Rhythm of Insatiability becomes more rapid, until
in the Men who are more than men the rapidity of the
Rhythm of Insatiability enters a Silence and Darkness of
rapidity beyond all merely human sight.
Perhaps the most wonderful insatiability of all is the
insatiability of what we call electricity, as is to be seen in
that descent of lightning which is but the call of the leashed
lightning below for release from above, as the leashed
lightning above calls for release from below. The call
from above and from below are almost simultaneous, and
the lightning of earth meets the lightning of the skies.
There flashes forth a satisfaction, to be followed, under the
Rhythm of Obdience, by an insatiability once more.
Then there are the two Rhythms of Retardation and
Acceleration, each operating simultaneously with the other.
The Light of the Sun retards as it accelerates, the superior-
ity of one over the other depending upon a variety of
circumstances connected with the Man upon which the Sun
shines. Substantially, the Rhythm of Acceleration predom-
inates, and becomes more and more marked as Man grows
from more to more. Acceleration is a mode of the More,

and the more the More, the more rapid the acceleration.
In his wonderful researches, Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose has
revealed the operation of these two rhythms as they act
upon the life of plants.
I
might have united these two rhythms in one Rhythm
of Balance, but the balance of nature seems to lie in some-
what of an unbalance.
Then there is the Rhythm of Silence and Quietude.
This, to me, is one of the most marvellous of all rhythms,
for it is the rhythm of the eternal depths of life in all
living
things. There are the surfaces we see, and the depths
which so often escape us. This rhythm is
essentially of the
Eternities rather than of Time. How wonderfully is this
rhythm to be witnessed in the sub-human kingdoms of
nature, and especially in all
young things who spend their
earlier growings in the accelerations of the Silences and the
Quietudes. How protective is the Rhythm of Silence and
Quietude as a hawk hovers above some small creature upon
the earth, which instantly enfolds itself within this Rhythm
of Invisibility. How protective is this rhythm always and
for all. How essential to the student of Yoga.
Then there is the Rhythm of Memory. In every state
of consciousness Man remembers. The rock remembers.
The precious stone remembers. The earth, the very mud
and slime and dust, remember. The tree remembers. The
flower remembers. The weed itself remembers. Every
insect remembers. Each animal remembers. And Man
in the human kingdom remembers, too.
What do they remember? They remember whence
they have come, where they are, whither they are wending
their way. They remember the past, the present, the
future. Indeed is it true that this Rhythm of Memory is
the magic thread upon which the beads of living are strung.
Indeed is it true that Memory is the Saving Grace of Life,
even though ignorance sometimes causes memory to
THE RHYTHMS OF MAN 395
appear painful. But where would Man be without that
memory which is the outward and visible sign of his
Godhead ?
Everywhere Men are remembering. In every kingdom
Memory is at work. We live, we hope, we strive, we
endure because we remember, because we are constantly
putting together that which so often seems apart.
The Rhythm of Then I
may refer to the Rhythm of Curvature.
1
Every-
Curvature or
Gravitation where Life bends. Nowhere is Life straight, whatever it
may appear within a limited area. Every individuality bends
to all other individualities. We may, if we like, call this
rhythm the Rhythm of Gravitation. But I
personally prefer
to emphasize the principle of Universal Curvature. The
Rhythm of Gravitation or Curvature is a rhythm inherent,
as are, of course, all other rhythms, in every Man in every
kingdom of nature. It is a state of consciousness no less
than any other state of consciousness such as a thought or
a feeling, and it is
part of all states of consciousness. The
Rhythm of Curvature is no more outside of us than any
other rhythm. There is
nothing outside us which is not
within us, for there is
omnipresent Universality.
The Rhythm of Gravitation or Curvature is the link
between the ever-above and the ever-below. The below
gravitates towards the above, but we may think at the
same time the above also gravitates, though in quite a
different way, towards the below. It could not be other-
wise as we gain understanding of the Rhythm of Unity.
This Law of Gravitation is
among those rhythms which I
would venture to call dependent, rather than primary.
The Rhythm of There is another rhythm which I confess I do not at
Projection
all understand. I must call it, for want of any better term-
inology, the Rhythm of Projection. There would seem to be
inherent in all Life a quality of projectiveness, so that while
on the one hand the whole of Life, the whole of a

Forthgoing, as I have suggested in the second aspect of the
Point, is itself a projection from some infinitely vaster Life
in its aspect of a mightier Forthgoing still, on the other
hand each Individuality, each Man, is himself both a projec-
tion and a projector. In his universal aspect he projects.
In his individual aspect he is
projected. He is a projection
from a Line which is his ancestral Line.
The Web that is the Womb gives birth to a Line, to
a Cosmic Line. But this Line is
composed of an infinite
number of Lines, a bundle of Lines as I have called it, and
for every Individuality there is the Line of his descent
itself the projection from a Line more ultimate still.
Every colour we see is a projection from a Cosmic
Colour.
Every sound we hear is a projection from a Cosmic
Sound.
Every form on earth and in the heavens is a projec-
tion from a Cosmic Form.
The Rhythm of Projection is universal, and as I con-
template it, I seem to see the whole universe as a mass of
interrelated funnels, narrowing down from an impenetrable
Beyond.
We may also notice the Rhythm of Adjustment or
Interplay. What are called the Laws of Karma and Rein-
carnation are constituent elements in the Rhythm of Adjust-
ment. It is under the influence of this rhythm that
Universal Brotherhood enters into the Concrete out of the
Abstract. Universal Brotherhood is a reality, but it becomes
visible under the Rhythm of Adjustment, whereby each
Individuality achieves in terms of Self-consciousness that
which it for ever is in terms of consciousness.
Then there is the Rhythm of Uniform Response. The
One Life ever responds in the same way to all stimuli, to
all impacts upon it in its innumerable modes of Individuality.
God economizes, I have already said. No less true is it
THE RHYTHMS OF MAN 397
The Rhythm of
Continuity

that God simplifies. Everywhere everything grows in the
same way in the very midst of its individual uniqueness. As
Man grows in the human kingdom, so does he grow exactly
in every other kingdom of his nature. The quality of the
growing may vary. The quality of the response may vary.
But the nature of growing and of response is one.
Then there is the Rhythm of Continuity. There is
growth all the time, not part of the time.
Even the Rhythm of Retardation expresses a continuity
of growing. Nature abhors all vacua in growing, and indeed
does not permit any. Growth is constant and without
hiatuses, even though the French proverb so truly says
quelquefois il faut reculer pour mieux sauter. Some day we
shall find, as Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose has told us, that
there are no frontiers between the sciences, no frontiers
between physics, physiology and psychology, no frontiers
between states of consciousness, no frontiers between king-
doms of nature, no frontiers between life and death of any
kind. One ceaseless and unending stream, and perhaps
there is not even that digging of holes in space which
Fohat 1
is
supposed to do.
When was Man not ? When did he ever cease to be ?
Is not Life anathi ?
I wonder if I dare single out seven primordial rhythms,
the permutations and combinations of which give us all
the rest :
I have already indicated the Rhythm of Movement,
the Rhythm of Existence, the Rhythm of the Unity of Life,
the Rhythm of the Universality of Life, and then have
followed with rhythms which depend partly upon these four
and partly upon three others :
The Rhythm of the Hierarchy of Life. Life is a Ladder,
and this fact expresses one of the great modes of the
evolutionary process.
1
See page 163.
398 SYMBOLS RELEASED AND DYNAMIC
The Rhythm of
Difference
The Rhythm of
Self-
Contamedness
Then there is the Rhythm of Difference, or if
you like
so to call it, the Rhythm of Uniqueness. This is a rhythm
complementary to the Rhythm of Unity. There is infinite
scope for meditation on this rhythm, so as to learn how to
make the great reconciliation between difference and
identity.
Then comes the seventh primordial rhythm, the
Rhythm of Self-containedness. This rhythm is one of the
most wonderful of all though all are, of course, wonder-
ful because it tells us that every Man of the Sea,
every Individuality, has, under the divine dispensation
of the Point in its aspect of Forthgoinq, within himself
all that he needs for the next step he has to take.
All that he needs for his immediate growth is within
his reach.
How we are to understand this I
really do not know,
for it involves the fact that end and beginning, beginning
and end, are one, and that the means between the two
is inherent in both. It comes to this that every living
creature is endowed at any and at every moment of his
existence, no matter in what kingdom of nature he may be
dwelling, with all the equipment he needs for the next step
he has to take on the evolutionary way. Life is Self-
contained and also self-contained, if I
may avail myself of
the subtle difference offered by the change from capital
letter to what is called lower-case. No one is left starving
for want of the necessary sustenance to strengthen him on
his way. The kingdom of God is within each and every
one of us.
I feel that the more we realize this Rhythm of Self-
containedness the more shall we grow healthily, harmoni-
ously and healthily, and indeed Yoga is in part for our
perception of this and all the other rhythms, so that we
may sail upon the waves of their vibrations to the shores
of fulfilment.

Each life is in fact a universe, perfectly equipped for the
whole of its

have been placed higher up. But I have not troubled to
try to give each of these rhythms its accurate place. The
first rhythm is, of course, the Rhythm of the Existence of
Life, and because of this I have said that in a sense
Movement seems to be anterior to very Life itself. With-
out Movement no Existence. Movement is the father-
mother of Existence, from the point of view of cosmic
realities. Existence is
dependent upon Movement, not
Movement upon Existence. But then must we not postulate
the Movement of No-Existence ? Yes, we must. The
Ceaseless Breath of God is primordial and is
independent
of Life, independent of Existence. Movement is the
" matter
"
of Life, of Existence.
Then come the other rhythms, among which I have
noted the Rhythms of
Obedience
Insatiability
Projection

Some of these may be one or another of the Seven
Rhythms stated otherwise. But it is
very difficult to
perceive where one rhythm begins and another ends.
They are as much fused into a whole as they are inde-
pendent. They are as much one as they are many.
Inevitably, therefore, confusion may arise as we try to
distinguish that which from one aspect is
indistinguishable.
Book Four From the Symbols
to No-Symbol
SYNOPSIS OF BOOK FOUR
Chapter 1
YOGA AS BRIDGE FROM WEAKNESS TO STRENGTH
I reiterate that the central theme of this form of Yoga is Fulfilment
the gathering together and taking with one of all one has garnered
throughout the evolutionary process Thus weaknesses have their place
in it no less than virtues. And we fulfil both by cremating them by
burning them into their essential purities, dancing with joy as their pure
ashes are flung into distances by the winds of creation, and as their gold
enters our being to become part of the setting of its future glory
Chapter 2
THE MACHINERY OF YOGA
I
begin with a purification by fragrance (incense), continue with a
purification by sound (my own music), and then actually begin the Yoga
itself with a posture-symbol, always a Line posture, for the Line gives
me majestic conceptions. I rest in a single symbol or pass from one
symbol to another. I
emphasize that the student will not approach any-
where near Yoga, simply because he is perfect in posture, breathing, or
performance of some magic.
Chapter 3
SUNLIT FOOD
In addition to the need for right food, there is the need for quick
assimilation and elimination. There can be dead sunlight in the body.
There can be radiant sunlight in the body. It is the latter that the Yogi
needs. The body should be healthy, light, and as delicate as a highly
sensitized negative plate.
Chapter 4
THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP
Sleep is for physical re-creation, as well as for transferring the
waking consciousness from the physical to inner planes. The Yogi is
active on the inner planes, and so he plans out the whole 24 hours of
404 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
day and night as if
they constituted one spell of living. The student
may well try to do this. There are rhythms that help him to earn to
glide into sleep with ease and grace, and to remember when awake
work done on an inner plane and requiring attention on the physical
plane. Quiet will and inexhaustible patience are needed.
Chapter 5
THE SYMBOLS IN CENTRE-RADIANCES
The symbols may be correlated to centres in man or in the universe.
Thus, the Point corresponds to and is in the Heart ; the Web-Womb to
the Navel Chakra which begins the stem of the Lotus ; the Line corre-
sponds to the spine and includes the Throat Chakra the spine is
spirit-
ually a circle and thus constitutes a chakra. The Circle-Globe is in every
chakra, and corresponds to the aura which includes all the bodies of
man. The Cross corresponds to the Root Chakra, and the Svastika to
the Spleen Chakra. The Lotus as Bud corresponds to the Brow Chakra,
and as Flower to the Crown Chakra.
Chapter 6
AWAKENINGS INTO YOGA CONSCIOUSNESS
Even the little doings of daily life are grist to the evolutionary mill
of the Man within- who is
becoming God And I have found apparent
trifles stirring some higher consciousness, so that a veil is lifted for a
moment, and I see into a beyond. Two principles emerge from such a
vision, first that God is a Universal Mother, and secondly that God
economizes.
Chapter 7
THE SYMBOLS AS A ZODIAC
I see the symbols as forms of the Formless, as causes of the Cause-
less, as movements of the Movementless ; but also as static from the
dynamic, as successive and as simultaneous, as omnipresent and as
archetypes, as appearances from Reality. And I see them as having
spatial relationships in the heavens, just like the signs of the Zodiac.
Are we born under one or another of these symbols also ? Are we
servers of a particular symbol ?
Chapter 8
SCIENTIFIC ULTIMATES
The symbols are primary qualities of life. Therefore their essential
quality of Ceaseless Breath, Rhythm or Movement is
everywhere, in
every particle of nature. Nature is constituted by Points, and each
Point is an expanding universe, a microscopic seed evolving to Divinity.
SYNOPSIS 405
A Divinity or God reproduces Gods, not in His own image, but able to
become images of their own eternities. The Rhythm of Universal Unity
demands an all-pervading curvature for its accurate expression.
Chapter 9
SOME NOTES ON SPACE AND TIME
Time is a quality of Being, and so of all beings. Space is the Sea
of the Unmanifest, and so a quality of all Men of the Sea Space and
Time are the Father and Mother of Individuality the first and second
dimension, all other dimensions being the children of Space-Time. Space
is both individual and universal Individuality becomes crucified in
order to know its individual Divinity, knowing which it also comes to
know its divine Universality, and returns to Space. Thus we have first
the Yoga of Universality, then the Yoga of Individuality, and finally the
Yoga of Individuality-Universality Space is substance, and Time is move-
ment but the two must be one. Unmanifest Space is more solid than
the manifested physical plane. And Time accelerates in the higher
reaches of evolution. Does evolution involve rarefication or intensifi-
cation ? I see that there must be an octave or many octaves of Space
and of Time And I have no doubt that our Teachers are able to
play with their beings these octaves of Time and Space.
Chapter 10
THE WINGS OF DIVINE DISCONTENT
In the beginning Man had Wings, but he had to learn to use them.
The process of learning occupied the period of seven kingdoms of
nature. At the end of the seventh kingdom Man flew to the heights of
heaven, then back to earth, and took up the task of helping others
to learn to fly.
I
hope my readers are very conscious of their
Divine Discontent, and this book will help to stir their consciousness
more deeply.
Chapter 11
THE GATES OF HEAVEN
The wagon of our being is
already hitched to the star of our
Divinity. We have but to make them move in perfect unison. Then
we knock upon Doors so mightily exalted in the Scriptures of every
faith, as giving entry into the glories of that Ineffable Mystery which, in
veil after veil, meets the Soul as it moves from fulfilment to fulfilment.
Chapter 12
INITIATIONS ON THE PATH OF FULFILMENT
Initiations are expansions and explosions of consciousness which
either occur in the normal process of evolution, or may be hastened
towards the end of the human kingdom. The first Initiation is birth into
406 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
spiritual life ; it intensifies feeling, and reflects the Web symbol. The
second Initiation begins youth of spiritual life ; it intensifies the mind and
gives power, and it reflects the Line. The third Initiation begins the man-
hood of spiritual life, it
brings tests and transfigurations, and it reflects
the Circle-Globe. The fourth Initiation means maturity in spiritual life ; it
gives the power to make heavens of hells, to embody unity in a variety
of ways, and it reflects the Cross and the Svastika. The fifth Initiation
takes the individual to Wisdom, Truth, Self-realization ; He is now a
Master and enters the superhuman kingdom The Lotus has flowered.
Chapter 1 3
THE SYMBOL-OCTAVE OF MANIFESTATION
The symbols form octaves of all kinds. This book deals with the
octave of manifestation, of the evolutionary process, each symbol sound-
ing a note of change of consciousness : Point, forthgoing ; Web-Womb,
preparation ; Line, vivification ; Circle-Globe, limitation . Cross, manifesta-
tion ; Svastika, evolution ; Lotus, fruition ; Point, consummation. There
is a sound, a colour and a form fundamental to each individual, and also
to each seven-year period of his life.
Chapter 14
THE UNITY OF LIFE
Each one of these symbol-formulaa is a scintillation of God. There-
fore must I see and hear each one of them in every God in every
kingdom of nature as I
bring each one of them little by little into
perspective in my own being. And their pulsating rainbow colours and
sounds and forms lift me into a world in which each colour and sound
and form speaks its word of power, offering the homage of its glory
at the throne of its God. It is wonderful indeed to know one's colour,
sound and form, and use them to sing one's own unique song of joy
unto the Lord. This Yoga will help to such knowledge.
Chapter 1 5
THE LORDS OF THE SYMBOLS
Every Man, in every kingdom of nature, is a reflection of a far-off
divine event of a divine Ultimate. Every colour, sound, form and
fragrance has its Lord. Each of the seven symbols has its Lord and His
priests, and its servers who are ourselves. These Lords are indeed "
nearer
than hands and feet." They are concerned with us even in the details
of our living, and attend the chief or ceremonial events, the majesties,
of our lives. There are Lords or Guardians of races, of faiths, of
nations, of countries, of cities, of places of worship, of great monu-
ments, of great waterfalls and mountains. To which Life-symbol, and
so to which Lord, do you belong ?
SYNOPSIS 407
Chapter 1 6
THE THREE GREAT PURPOSES OF YOGA
Yoga is Wise Action, that action which serves the three great pur-
poses of Creation, Nourishment and Regeneration. But whichever his
purpose, the Yogi is ever a channel between the life of Yoga and all
living things. He builds bridges, and every bridge is a bridge between
a less and a more, from a darkness to a light, over a chasm of ignorance
to an abode of truth and peace. He glorifies, in his Yoga, sound, form
and colour so that they become the Voice, the Image and the Garment
of God.
Chapter 17
FULFILLING THE SYMBOLS IN YOGA
In fulfilling the Yoga of each symbol we incarnate its mystery-reality
in ourselves, and in every detail of the Yoga we have chosen to per-
form. And each must discover for himself how he shall fulfil each
symbol in and for himself The Yoga of one is not the Yoga of another,
so must each of us learn to know for himself his Yoga of each symbol.
Only general suggestions may be given by another.
Chapter 18
THAT : THE SYMBOL-LESS !
The conception of No-Symbol is our safety-valve, for without it
there is
danger lest we become a slave to symbols instead of using
them as means to an end. There is in us the very THAT which is be-
yond all symbols. THAT registers our Yoga, in which the Yogi fades
away, and Yoga alone remains. Let us stand for a moment, if we can,
in the Presence of THAT. Some day we shall so stand for ever.
Chapter 19
YOGA WITHOUT END
At times i find myself so close to the centre that the whole of my-
self and my surroundings become integral parts of the symbols - of each
separately and of all
together. Yoga is everywhere round me, Yoga
fills and is the universe. Yoga is oneness, Yoga is individuality, Yoga is
life. I am a Yogi, every one is a Yogi, and every atom in every kingdom
of nature is a Yogi at a certain stage of unfoldment. And then I
try to
venture out of bounds, despite Rings-Pass-Not of safety, to ascend the
ultimate heights and depths. What presumption, you say. No, I am
but treading the Way of the Self.
408 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
Chapter 20
THE SYMBOLS AS BULWARK AGAINST BARBARISM
The symbols are for the service of the world as well as for con-
templation. They are to be foci for Power, Wisdom, Glory, no less than
symbols of fundamental Realities. Thus vibrant mantras are available
which enable the Yogi to use each symbol as an individual bulwark
against the barbarism of ignorance, of cruelty, of dishonour. For
the symbols are part of such a world-wide bulwark Further, the
soldier-Yogi may fuse himself into the Universal Bulwark without any
particular reference to the symbols
Chapter 21
THE ENDLESS GLORY
People talk of freedom and make new shackles for themselves
Life has limits, within which each of us can be unique Our Theosophy
is a petal of the Lotus of Theosophy, as our universe is a petal of
a Cosmic Lotus. Divine Wisdom is revealed to us that we may seek
and find it within ourselves. Theosophy gives a Plan and bricks to build
it. We may experiment with these, but the time must come when each
of us will make his own Plan and choose his own bricks, using Theosophy
and the Masters as Givers of Light -for our inspiration and illumination
The Masters expect this of us
Chapter 22
THE LIFE MAGNIFICENT
What is the nature of Life ? There seem to me two ways for the
student to discover this. He is Life, and if he can intensify Life, become
Life-ful, he may know something of Life first-hand and be able to
describe it a breathless process. Thus come perception upon per-
ception of the vistas and details of Life, as veil upon veil lifts from the
inner eyes. The second mode is to go back and back from Form and
penetrate, as it were, into the shadow of Life. Thus i see myself as a
projection, an offspring, of Life, resembling Life in every particular. I
now find that Life is
Symbol-less though in a way it is
Symbol-ful
Life is
Yoga-less, though Yoga is a mode whereby Life in individuality
gathers up all modes of Life's vibrations and gazes upon their Universal-
ity. And Yoga is the fulfilment of all
things as Life. Yet, what is Life ?
In a word, each one must know Life, not I who must know Life for him.
The end of this chapter is to leave the reader free , and the purpose
of this book Fulfilment and Release.

and dead Walt Whitman
It is
very important to reiterate even at the cost of
redundancy and tiresome repetition that in this form of
Yoga weaknesses have their place no less than virtues.
Yoga is a bridge between a weakness and its
corresponding
strength, and carries the weakness onwards into the
strength which is its flower.
Indeed, this is one of the most helpful characteristics
of this form of Yoga, for it
regards a weakness scientifically,
not as anything to be abhorred, but a something to be
understood, to be recognized as having its due place in the
evolutionary process, but needing in its own good time to
undergo a transubstantiation, a sublimation, a fruition, no
less than any virtue of whatever degree.
The student of Yoga must learn to appraise his own
individual weaknesses it is assumed that he has reached
the stage of definitely knowing some of them to perceive

He makes his

their place in his unfolding, and to understand that they
are no longer accelerating but are actually retarding his
rate of evolutionary movement.
If we take the weakness of hatred as an example, we
shall find that it is a weakness, because having fulfilled its
purpose we still retain its now retarding and deadening
effect. Hatred has its place in the life of the savage, for
not only does it
give clearer definition to the individuality
he has just achieved, but it also protects him against
elements which for the time being are unfavourable to his
growth. He needs hatred at his stage of evolution. And
even beyond the actual savage stage, hatred may have to
survive for a variety of protective purposes.
The individual who says that he hates wrong may still
need hatred in order to protect him from wrong. The
individual who is able to say that he hates injustice, tyranny,
persecution, and any other circumstance evocative of his
disapproval, may actually need to hate them because hatred
of them is his way, at his stage, of knowing that he must
avoid them, and that they have had their day and must now
cease to be.
The student of Yoga, however, examining any hatreds
he may still have I cannot imagine any student of Yoga
having any hatreds, and am only supposing the almost
impossible will see that hatred is for self-protection, will
know that he should have reached the stage of needing no
such self-protection, and will therefore place it in the
reservoir of his experience, as part of the material once used
in the building of his Godhead. But he will have it on hand
for the understanding of his fellows, so that instead of hating
their hatred, or disapproving it, he will impersonally gauge
its positive value to those whom he is
trying to help.
Should he by any chance feel hatred towards an
individual or towards some opinion, activity, or custom, he
will either see that he is
weakening himself by putting on

armour when he needs none, or he may see that his
hatred is a form of pride, in that he lacks the lessons such
opinions, activities, or customs teach, and repels that which
shouts aloud his defect!veness. He will then, if he be of
the stuff of which Yogis are made, deliberately take into
himself the objects of his hatred and make them his own,
Similarly in the case of the force we call sex. The
Yogi will look upon its manifestation in himself with all dis-
passion, neither with abhorrence nor with self-justification.
He will see that the high purpose of sex in these outer-
most worlds, and of sexual activity, is not merely for the
sake of the perpetuation of the race, though it is used for
this purpose, but also to cause men and women to remem-
ber in the very midst of the sexual erstasy that it is the
infinitely wondrous living witness to the Creative Spirit
which dwells in all, so that they may offer it in reverence,
and learn to raise it to the sublimest heights of creative
expression, as do the world's greatest the geniuses, the
saints, the heroes.
The Yogi will know what he has to do with his power of
sex. He will know that not only may there be occasion for
creation on the physical plane, but that such creation is
only
a very partial expression of the Divinity of Creation, that he
must learn to create splendours, wonders, with his feelings,
with his emotions, with his mind, with every form of higher
consciousness in which he is able consciously to dwell, that
he must in terms of his own individual uniqueness become
an artist, a scientist, a philosopher, a restless seeker after
Truth. So does he lift
up that creative power which so
beautifully expresses itself in all real and dedicated marriage,
into height after height of achievement, until at last, as
God, He creates a magic Call to an evolving life.
The true Yogi looks his weaknesses in the face, per-
ceives that he calls them weaknesses because somewhere
in himself he knows he needs them no more, registers the

worth they have been, dissolves them into their essential
light, and retains the memory of them to be channels of
service and understanding between him and those who
perhaps still need their ministration.
Indeed is the Memory of God the strength of His
creatures. So should be our memories a strength to all
around us, so that the nearer we approach unfoldment into
our full
flowering, the closer do we draw in strength and
service to all seeds and buds and little flowers of the great
Brotherhood of Life to which we belong.
Weaknesses are reversed virtues. Hatred is a form of
self-centred love, and so all its major and minor permuta-
tions. And so often do we seek to immolate those around,
us upon the altar of our selfishness, the worst desecration
of all
being that of the immolation of woman to satisfy the
lust of man, or perhaps the perpetration of cruelty upon
the defenceless the preying by the human upon the
kingdoms below, in special measure upon the animal
kingdom. As I have already said, a Man who enters
the human kingdom seems to need to establish his new-
found individuality by this centring of love upon himself, or
upon those immediately around him. He hews his individ-
uality out of the universality in which he has heretofore
been nursed. He hates for self -protection. He lusts for
self-experience. He fights for self-preservation, At every
moment of time he is
saying
" I ... I ... I ..." and
it is a very small, suspicious and aggressive "I." It has
memories of universality and it is fearful of returning
thither. It is afraid of being lost in a multitude of " I's
"
constituting a
" We." It wants to be an " I
"
alone, or
with a little family, and at most possibly also with a tribe
of families.
Hence hatred and all other " virtues
"
of this class,
for us and very specially for the would-be Yogi, are
outworn.

Even the lesser weaknesses, such as, for example,
irritability, are survivals of an erstwhile self-centredness.
Some sort of pride must, of course, remain for a very
long length of time, even with the Yogi himself, for Man
needs pride in the human kingdom almost to the very end
of his sojourn in it. But when he is
already a Prince of
the human kingdom, even if not yet a King, he will turn his
pride outwards so that he becomes proud of his fellow-
creatures and proud of his power to be of wise service to
them. He will take pride in himself for the quality of his
service and not for a superiority which can crush.
I sometimes think that I
might use the idea of crema-
tion instead of the idea of sublimation when I
try to convey
the central theme of this form of Yoga the gathering to-
gether and the taking with one of all one has garnered
throughout the evolutionary process. It is the idea of
withdrawal which is
foreign to this form of Yoga, of leaving
behind, of renunciation.
This Yoga comes in a spirit of fulfilment, not in a spirit
of renunciation. To sacrifice is not to give up- -the very
idea of giving up dims the fineness of the sacrifice by intro-
ducing into it a discordant note of spiritual bargaining. To
sacrifice is to make holy and beautiful in a spirit of joy and
gladness. He who loses his life for the sake of another is
beginning to fulfil it unto life eternal.
1
In our virtues we may find our strength. But in our
weaknesses we may find and know our brotherhood. We do
not withdraw from our weaknesses, nor do we turn our backs
upon them. We use them for comradeship's sake. We
draw near to all our fellows because of them, as some day
we shall draw still nearer to our fellows because we have
fulfilled them.
How are we to fulfil them ? By cremating them. By
burning them into their essential purities, dancing with joy

as their pure ashes are flung into distances by the winds of

The flames of a weakness rise as high as those of a
virtue, and who shall say which ashes are more pure ?
We regret no weaknesses, for we strive to use them
in service as from time to time they sit upon our thrones.
Every weakness is a strength in the becoming, and to
cremate a weakness is to release the fire of its strength.
Neither are we our virtues, save as now and then they
master us, nor are we our weaknesses, save as now and
then they master us. We are the Will, and well may we
not only cremate our weaknesses that they may show forth
their strength, but well also may we cremate our virtues
that these may show forth their more splendid selves.
We must treasure the memory of our weaknesses, and
the strength to which they have led. We must treasure
the memory of our virtues, and the strength to which they
have led. It is the Memory of God that makes certain the
goal of life. It is our memories of all
things that give us
strength to continue on our ways and to help those who,
perchance, are finding their ways hard and dark.
Memory is
Light, not Darkness. Only is it the latter
as we remember ill.

Om ! the way of chanting will we now declare : Sounds
(or colours), rhythm, length, strength, balance, and the union of
sounds. The lesson thus on chanting is declared. . . . But they
who zealously perform the mystic practices, in faith, in forest (or
hermitage), at peace, with wisdom, keeping the beggar's rule
they, free from stain, fare forth, by the sun's gate, to where there
is that deathless Man, the very Self that no man can exhaust.
Upanishads
It would be immensely interesting were I able to
correlate in even more detail the colours, sounds, forms
and fragrances which are but modes of Life in its
unfolding.
Would that I could discover the colour of the uni-
verse, the note of the sun, the perfume of the world. I
am well aware that successful Yoga practice depends to no
small extent upon a favourable disposition of colours,
sounds, forms and fragrances.
1
And I see clearly that if t
could build a structure for my Yoga composed of colour
material, sound material, form material, and perfume
material, weaving into these the universe colour, the sur>
colour, the world colour, and my colour, and similarly in the
case of sounds and forms and perfumes, I should be making
very straight my Yoga pathway.
I think I must leave to the imagination of my readers
the choice of colours, sounds, forms and perfumes, which
seem to be most concordant, for differences of tempera-
ment cause immense differences of choice.

FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
For myself, the note of G is
my basic note, as will be
noticed in the little musical theme, to which I have else-
where referred.
1
Then as to colour, I think purple affords me the most
constant satisfaction, and gives me the most vivid inspirations.
As for forms, the curved Plumb-Line, if I
may be
permitted an apparent contradiction, is most provocative of
majestic conceptions, for I see it as basic in such widely
different splendours as the great image of Nataraja,
2
the
Lord Shiva, Lord of the Dance, as the glorious Winged
Victory in the Louvre, and the statue of Moses, by Michael
Angelo, in Rome. I see it also in Thorwaldsen's magnificent
and real image in Copenhagen of the Christ. Perhaps my
idea of a Plumb-Line differs from conventional conceptions.
My choice of fragrances largely depends upon the
nature of the activity in which I
happen to be engaged,
My choice, for the most part, varies between a particular
form of incense used in Eucharistic services, sandalwooC
and the perfume of newly-mown hay.
For everyday use lavender appeals to me, as alsc
jasmine and attar of roses. But of course there musl
not be a trace of alcohol in any perfume. In the Wesl
perfumes are rendered almost useless by this desecration.
For actual Yoga activity I should certainly use Eucharistic
incense, drenching with it the place I
may have chosen for
its
expression.
In fact I should begin with a purification by fragrance,
continue with a purification by sound, possibly using m>
musical theme, and then making an actual beginning of the
Yoga itself with a number of posture-synribols. Each one o\
these postures is a Plumb-Line posture, in that the Line, the
vertical Line of Vivification, is its fundamental form, making
a channel from North to South, thus sending through me

the power of the Line, and constituting me a Piston-Rod
from Heaven to Earth and from Earth to Heaven.
Thus is the machinery of my Yoga set in motion, and
either I rest in a single symbol, or pass from one to another
as may seem expedient.
But I would emphasize that a student of Yoga is far
from even beginning to achieve Yoga as he is
perfect in
posture, competent in adjusting the laws of nature to the
performance of tricks of magic which mean very little to the
true Yogi, or as he plays about with consciousness with the
aid of modes of breathing.
A real Yogi is neither acrobat nor juggler. He is
treading the road to a kingship whereby he embodies and
wields the powers that make for righteousness, that make
for a strength and independence of character which are
man's most precious aids as he moves on his way to become
Superman.
1
A true Yogi may have occasion, as he embodies and
wields these powers, to perform what are wonders to the
uninstructed. Madame Blavatsky had such occasion. But
these are at most but the foam on the sea of his Yoga.

Our Lord went on, teaching how fair

Sufficient drinks and meats . . .
Seeing that knowledge grows, and life is one,
And mercy cometh to the merciful The Light of Asia
It has been borne in upon me during these studies of
Yoga that in addition to the urgent need for right food,
there is as an accompaniment to that urgent need, the
need for quick assimilation and elimination. The waste-
products of the body, for the Yogi at least, should as soon
as possible be eliminated, and assimilation should take place
as quickly as possible, so that those foods which can be so
assimilated should be chosen in preference to any foods
which cannot.
The reason for this is that it is
highly necessary for
food's sunlight to pass through the physical body as quickly
as possible, so that there may be an ever-upwelling, or
descending, of fresh sunlight from which the light has not
yet been *taken. There can be dead sunlight in the body.
There can be radiant sunlight in the body, It is the latter
sunlight that the Yogi so imperatively needs.
It is, in my judgment, less an endurance that the
true Yogi needs, and far more an immense sensitivity to
the larger consciousness with all its subtle rapidity of
vibrations.

Of course, the physical body should be as healthy as
possible, but it should be healthy without any exaggera-
tions. It should be healthy, light, and delicate as a highly
sensitized negative plate.
Foods, therefore, should be chosen to these ends, and
so too should foods for the feelings and the emotions,
foods for the mind, foods for the higher states of conscious-
ness. All should be chosen for their power to keep the
body light yet strong, to keep the body dynamic and ever-
moving, to keep the bodies in that state of eager tension
which receives the thrills of the Gods and spreads them
abroad among men.

THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP
Why Sleep for
the Yogi ?
There is but
one
Consciousness
Night is the magic time . . when joyously one drops the
weightier vehicles and ventures forth into the land of the Unknown
that land which yet seems in some strange way, the Very Well-
known. . . . The Adventure of Night
That which is the night of all beings, for the disciplined man
is the time of waking ;
when other beings are waking, then is it
night for the Muni who seeth. - The Bhagavad Gita II, 69
The question of sleep must also be considered. For
what purpose should a student of Yoga go to sleep? Partly
for physical re-creation, to help the purely physical con-
sciousness, such as it is, elemental and elementary, to have
time for the necessary re-creation without the active pene-
tration of other-consciousness activities. But partly also for
the purpose of transferring the waking consciousness from
the physical plane to inner planes.
Material dealing with the purely physical aspects of
healthy sleep is abundantly available. But an effective
transference of the waking consciousness from the physical
plane within depends partly on the establishment of a
Rhythm of Silence and Quietude throughout the conscious-
ness, partly on a harmonization of the posture of the
physical body with those waves of magnetism which will
most conduce to fruitful results both to the physical and to
the inner vehicles, and partly on a very active recognition
of the fact that whether the waking consciousness be
working on the physical plane or elsewhere, there is but
one consciousness, and more and more should the waking

consciousness need no transference, but be everywhere
simultaneously.
It is
very important to learn how to fall asleep with a
minimum of effort, how to glide into sleep by letting go
easily of the waking consciousness. It is
necessary to learn
how to cast oneself free from one's physical-plane moorings
with ease and grace, in as effortless a manner as possible.
One of the best ways of learning to do this is con-
stantly throughout the period of waking consciousness on
the physical to maintain contact with the inner planes. It
is
very useful to acquire the habit of periodically withdraw-
ing from the physical plane while functioning on it. Let
the physical plane from time to time be "
blackened out."
Let it
go out of perspective from time to time. Let
thoughts and feelings be elsewhere than on the physical
plane. Let the physical plane cease to exist for a time, so
that when it
reappears it is a little difficult to adjust oneself
to it, just for a moment.
In this way we shall accustom ourselves to live in a num-
ber of different rooms in our house, not in one alone. We
shall become able to go from one room to another during
normal residence in one particular room say the room
of the physical-plane consciousness. Thus we shall the
more easily pass, through what we curiously call sleep,
from one state of waking consciousness to another. And
when we have come through the doorway of sleep to an-
other state of waking consciousness, we shall again find
it comparatively easy to go to sleep from that state of
waking consciousness to a state still further within.
Sleep will thus become a convenient mode of changing
from one mode of waking consciousness to another within
such planes of consciousness as we may be able to reach.
I advocate, as I believe is
generally advocated for
yogic practice, the placing of the physical body with the
head to the North, wherever the North may be. I think

that magnetic currents flow most effectively through the
physical body as it is thus placed.
Then there must, as far as possible, be a plan of living
which includes what is called the sleep period no less than
the so-called waking period. Indeed, I
personally find that
I am much more awake within than without. And I
plan
my living from the other side of sleep, and carry out the
plan as best I can as one purpose, to be fulfilled in one
way on the physical plane and in other ways on the various
other planes on which I
may be able to function. But if
memories from within tend to become stifled, as they seek
to emerge without, then I would suggest that in the waking
consciousness on the physical plane, a plan be prepared
to include work on the physical plane, work on what we
call the astral plane, work on the mental plane, and work
on any other plane on which we have any capacity what-
ever to function.
For example, there will be the work we have to do on
the physical plane. We shall, of course, allow for this in
our plan. But apart altogether from such work, we shall
probably be able to do a certain amount of feeling work,
and a certain amount of thinking work, independent of the
feeling and thinking work we must do in the course of our
normal physical occupations.
We can send out feelings in various directions, and
we can send out thinkings too. We can send them to
some particular person or place, to affect some particular
condition, or we can send them out in a general way to
perfume the world or a people. We can do much building
work with our thoughts and feelings from the physical
plane, but independently of it. We can help immensely
with our feelings and thinkings, altogether apart from our
actual physical proximities.
But our plan must include an extension of this work in
more definite and practical ways as we are released, for the
THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP 423
time being, from the confinement of the physical body. We
can help quite effectively from the physical plane. But we
can help still more effectively from the feeling-emotion and
mental planes. We may say to ourselves : I will do this and
that during the functioning of the waking consciousness on the
physical plane. But when I transfer this waking consciousness,
when I
get to another side I must not say the other side,
since there are many other sides I must see about this
and that, I must go here, and I must go there. I must pay
a special visit to this place and to that. And as a matter
of excursion, I should very much like to see if I cannot get
into touch with So-and-So, and with such-and-such. I
wonder if I could study the symbols of this form of Yoga
while I am awake on an inner plane, so that when I
go to
sleep on the inner plane and wake up on the physical plane
there may be some memory, or at least some change in
consciousness, so that I
may be able to remember somehow
or other.
Thus shall we plan out the whole twenty-four hours of
day and night as if
they constituted but one spell of living.
The true Yogi always does this. We who are students of
Yoga may well try to do it.
For the Yogi Thus is the night planned as well as the day, for there
Night is lighter
r /
than Day is no difference at all between night and day, so far as
growing is concerned, and the more we become Yogis, the
more do we turn day into night and night into day. For
the Yogi night is
by no means a time of darkness. In truth,
for him it is
lighter by night than by day.
The Yogi asks It may be thought that I have entirely left out of
for Naught, his
J * J
Prayer is Praise account the opportunities there may be on the other side
of physical-plane sleep for contact with our Elders. Such
omission has been deliberate, for the true Yogi is intent on
work and on fitting himself for better work. He knows that
if an Elder wants him, He can send for him ; and he has no
intention of being among the ignorant importunate who are

always asking for blessings and boons. If the Yogi prays,
it is
praise. His prayer is in the spirit of the magnificent
Te Deum Laudamus of the Christian faith one of the
truest acts of that only real Love which is Praise with which
I am acquainted. The true Yogi knows that as he works
hardest, and with utmost wisdom and steadfastness, so does
he draw most near to his Lord.
It is well to set a certain rhythm for the night, and to
make provision for remembering in the waking consciousness
any matters requiring physical-plane attention.
There is, of course, a varied choice of rhythms for use
according to individual temperament. The rhythm of a
particular form, the rhythm of a particular note or group of
notes, a motif or theme of music, the rhythm of a colour-
scheme or special colour, the rhythm of a particular piece of
poetry or prose, of a song, the rhythm of a memory or an
aspiration, of a sacred word or sentence or group of
sentences, the rhythm of one of the symbols of this
particular form of Yoga, the rhythm of a fragrance,
the rhythm of one's own particular colour, sound, form
or fragrance ihese and many others may help us to
open quietly and truly the door between the physical and
the inner planes, or between one inner plane and another,
and if
necessary to close it
gently afterwards, until the time
shall have come when there are no more closed doors in
our living.
There is also the rhythm of a determination the
determination to do this or that when we have passed
through the doorway. I
regard this as a particularly potent
rhythm, for it is so often a response to a call from within,
and invokes that Rhythm of Gravitational Curvature which,
draws us irresistibly over the threshold. But even if it be
not a response to a call, it will
probably be a determination
of the Will " I want to do this as soon as I can cut my*
self adrift from my physical-body moorings. I must do it

as soon as possible, i must go here. I must go there.
There is no time to lose." Of course, there must be no
agitation over such a determination, or its object will be
defeated. It must be quiet and steady, infused with an
understanding as to how most smoothly to glide through
the doorway.
When the world is
sorely beset by troubles and
tragedies, by wars and tyrannies, by persecution and
violence, there is most urgent need on the other side of the
doorway for awakened workers. And I refer the reader to
C. W. Leadbeater's Invisible Helpers for a wealth of detail
regarding this department of activity.
1
But I think I
ought to make quite clear the fact that it
is
by no means necessary to go to sleep in order to do the
wonderful things that sometimes seem exclusive to the
other side of the doorway. In whatever state of conscious-
ness we may be, it is
possible for us to function no less
effectively on the physical plane in any other state into the
kingdom of which we may have been able to enter during
sleep. Similarly, it is
by no means necessary to be phys-
ically awake in order to attend to the things of the physical
plane. True, it is
necessary at a certain stage of evolution
to live in waking consciousness on a particular plane, how-
ever much we may be self-conscious on other planes, too.
But under the Rhythm of Projection we learn how to project
our life, our will, our thought, our feeling, to any distance,
and to make it active in its projected form. We ourselves,
on any plane, are projections. So lies it within our power
to project.
One more point : the technique of remembrance or
rather of accurate remembrance. Here again there is
another rhythm which will help us if we will try to contact it
in its all-pervading reality in our being. The Rhythm of
Memory will help us to remember, and the quickest way of
1
See also Chapter 20 of this Book Four
426 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
accurate remembrance is to enter into the spirit-rhythm of
Memory, so as to enable it to stimulate the particular
kind of memory we need, the channel we need between
one plane and another. It is a matter of time and regular
practice, without any feeling of hopelessness, even when
impressions filter through into the waking consciousness
which seem utterly absurd. In nature there is
nothing
absurd, even though there sometimes are distortions. When
we have a nightmare we have a distortion. When we have
something quite ridiculous, we have a distortion. And the
distortion is
generally due to a number of different ex-
periences becoming mixed up, for reasons into which I
need not enter here. The confusion is sometimes funny.
It is sometimes rather terrifying. But if we will take the
necessary trouble to dissect the remembrance, we shall
probably be able to trace a number of its elements to
different sources, and solve the riddle.
Only those with Above all, it is vital to be endowed with unwearying

THE SYMBOLS IN CENTRE-RADIANCES
The Linear

The Curved
Spine
The Universal
Lotus
When a man begins to develop his senses, so that he may
see a little more than everybody sees, a new and fascinating world
opens before him, and the brilliant colouring and the rapid and
incessant movement of the chakras are among the first objects in
that world to attract his attention. . . . The chakras or force-centres
are points of connection at which energy flows from one vehicle
or body of a man to another. The Chakras
Just as the vertical Line is, to use a word employed in
Hindu terminology, the stick round which the new evolu-
tionary process is to evolve, so is the spine of a human or
of any other form of being the stick round which he in his
turn evolves, and maybe revolves ! And just as a uni-
verse has its great centres or chakras connected with this
Line, which we may regard as the spine of the universe, so
has every being, human and otherwise, correspondences in
terms of centres or chakras which also have their definite
connections with his spine which is his Line.
It is
interesting to note that just as the Line which
establishes the Yard-Stick of a universe is curved, so is the
human spine, so that the phrase
" curvature of the spine
"
as used in medical parlance is true of the healthy spine,
though an excess of curvature will, of course, be highly
detrimental to health.
Furthermore, as the whole universe is in very truth a
Lotus both as to itself and as to every single element of its
constituent parts, so is every Man in every kingdom of
nature a Lotus, as is also every single constituent element.
428 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
The Macrocosm
and Microcosm
The Divine
Measure
The Spine as a
Chakra
C. W. Leadbeater, in his absorbing book The Chakras,
shows this very clearly with regard to the great centres of
energy in the human body. But every atom is a Lotus, as
some day science will discover.
Following the exposition given in The Chakras, I seem
to correlate in the following manner the symbols used in
this form of Yoga :
The Point is, of course, primordial, and is
expressed in
the heart. If
you think of the Point, as I have tried to describe
it, with its twofold aspect of Consummation and Forthgoing,
with Silence and Darkness, and then with the all-pervading,
Ceaseless Breath in the heart, you will begin to draw near
to the Man in the heart, whom possibly you may or may
not have met. If
you mean " Man
"
with a capital
"
M,"
he does live there, though I doubt that with physical eyes
you could see him. This Point which is the essence of the
primordial Point is in the heart, and the symbol is there.
The Point is the whole background of Man, physically
and in all other ways. It is Man, the Ultimate Macrocosm.
The Web that is the Womb is Man's immediate cause
macrocosmically and microcosmically.
I should then regard the spine, together with its non-
physical expressions and counterparts, as the Divine Measure
or Yard-Stick, round which is drawn the Circle of his being.
In the case of the physical being, the spine is an incarnation
of the Divine Measure or Yard-Stick, growing year by year
to its predestined measure. In the case of the super-
physical being, there is the spiritual spine of Man, which is
the counterpart of the Line of the universe to which he
belongs. The spine itself, however linear it
may appear, is
nevertheless spiritually a Circle. In some mysterious way,
entirely unapparent to us, it seems to curve in upon itself,
and thus constitutes a form of chakra. It is part of the
immense Circle of the Line of the universe, as is every other
spine of every Individuality in the universe, the outward
THE SYMBOLS IN CENTRE-RADIANCES 429

and visible sign of the Line curved to infinity. But
we are here out of our depths. The throat is also
the Line.
The Circle, that topaz-golden Circle which is the Ring-
Pass-Not in the heights ^s in the depths, is the body, not
only the physical body, but the feeling-emotion and all the
bodies with the extensions and limitations of their auras.
This Circle is a chakra, and is in every chakra.
Then comes the chakra called by C. W. Leadbeater
the Root Chakra corresponding to the symbol of the
Cross. The Spleen Chakra is the setting in motion of the
Wheel of the Law, the Svastika. And it is
significant that
C. W. Leadbeater tells us that this particular chakra " is
devoted to the specialization, subdivision and dispersion of
the vitality which comes to us from the Sun." It is, of
course, the Sun, the Lord of our system, who sets in
motion this wheel.
The next chakra, the Navel Chakra, is a complement-
ary chakra, fulfilling the activity of the Spleen Chakra. It
represents the Web that Is the Womb. " Father-
Mother spin a web
"
the solar plexus. It has much to do
with the earth. The activity of the Sun in setting in motion
the Svastika in its Spleen aspect must needs evoke the Sun
in its Earth aspect, and I
regard this Navel Chakra as ex-
pressing both the physical birth of the physical body and
the spiritual birth of the spiritual body. The Navel Chakra
is the beginning of the stem of that Lotus Flower which is
Man's apotheosis. It is to be noticed that green pre-
dominates in this chakra, intimating the influence both of
the physical and of the spiritual earth.
The Heart Chakra is an extension of the Svastika sym-
bol, as is the Navel Chakra. I think it specially reflects the
spirit of the Point, and therefore of the Life of the Sun, as
the Spleen Chakra reflects the activity of the Sun, and the
Svastika is there focussed. The Heart Chakra embodies
430 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL

Chakra

Chakra
The Crown
Chakra
the principle of Universality the Perfect Man, the Univers-
al Man.
The Throat Chakra embodies in the Svastika the Line
principle, as its colours so clearly indicate (See The Chafcras,
Plate VII).
It
represents the Line.
The Brow Chakra is the Bud of the Lotus Flower, the
beginning of the Crown Chakra. The Navel stem is at last
giving forth its Flower, and the Bud appears as the Brow
Chakra.
Finally, in consummation, comes the Crown Chakra,
the very Lotus Flower itself, so finely described in the
first chapter of The Chakras. Everything is the Lotus that
is the primordial form. All is Lotus-formed, the physical
-
plane Lotus or any other form however unlike the Lotus,
And Lotus-forms from ultimate depths to ultimate heights
in endless permutations !
The Heart Chakra, forthshadowing the principle of
Universality and of the Perfect Man in the microcosm, leads
directly to the Crown Chakra in which the Universal and the
Perfect Man resolve into the Macrocosm which they reflect.
From the Universal to the Individual. From the Indi-
vidual to the Universal. The Yoga of the Universal gives
birth to the Yoga of the Individual. The Yoga of the (ndi-
vidual exalts in full Self-consciousness the Yoga of the
Universal.

The student of Yoga, as he moves through the daily
routine of his life, should ever be on the alert for any
awakenings into Yoga consciousness which apparently chance
or casual circumstances may afford.
It has been my experience that if I hold much of
myself in reserve for unforeseen external eventualities,
and for communications with the inner worlds, even though
I
may have to be intent on some outer world activity, not
only shall I be more efficient in such activity, but I shall be
the less likely to miss opportunities which escape all but
those who are looking for opportunities of any kind.
To concentrate attention on a piece of outer work
means much more than to concentrate just the attention
of the mind or of the emotions. This is
only a partial con-
centration the concentration of the outer consciousness.
But what of the inner ? There is all the inner consciousness with
what I have called its Law, Light and Life aspects Buddhi,
Nirvana, and the consciousness beyond Nirvana. In most
of us such consciousness may be little more than asleep.
But a flash of each may from time to time be available to
those who are at work in ways worthy to receive these
higher blessings.
We live more fully than we know. As we move
about in our ordinary humdrum avocations, doing the duties
of the home, walking in the streets, playing our games,
busy in our offices, visiting the cinemas and theatres, talking
with friends and acquaintances, studying, creating, worship-
ping, relaxing as we do all these things, there is more

of us engaged in them than just the ordinary con-
sciousness in which we are in the habit of functioning. In
all these things a Man is
growing who is a God, a Man
who is
infinitely more than just the shadow of him to which
we give a name and an address.
And even though it is
customary to say that the
higher consciousness is not always attentive to the activities
of the lower, the fact, I am sure, remains that even in the
smallest details the Man who is God is
growing, and that
each circumstance of however microscopic a nature is
grist to his evolutionary mill. The mills of a God grind
slowly, but they grind even the smallest pieces which are
fed to them.
And my point is that there are many more pieces
strewn upon a Man-God's way than he sometimes picks up
wherewith to feed his mill.
He may well learn to act with the whole of himself,
not merely with his lower consciousness. And he may
well learn so to act even in the small details of eating and
sleeping and playing and sitting and walking and looking.
But he may also be on the alert for that which is
extra-normal, outside the ordinary frontiers of his con-
sciousness.
An apparently insignificant happening, of no percepti-
ble importance whatever, may start a tiny vibration in him
destined to affect his consciousness in a quite definite
manner.

crawling of some insect at my feet, an object in a room,
the intentness of a f'owing stream or fall of water, a

found affecting not only my feelings and my mind, but stir-
ring, too, some higher consciousness, so that a veil of some
kind is lifted, if
only for a moment, and I see into a beyond.
Of course, the awakening becomes more forceful in
the case of stimuli of major power. Listening to potent
music, watching a provocative play, sitting in the midst of
a crowd swayed by some fascinating game, feasting my
eyes and my ears upon some earnest orator, moving
through some great building, setting my feet upon a
sacred soil, reading some gem of poetry or of prose,
exalted by the sight of a glorious painting or piece of
sculpture, a flash of gracious memory thus inspired, the
Man-that-l-am-forever descends into his man-for-a-time,
and Divinity is
just for a moment wafted through his being.
He knows, just for a moment, what it is to be a God.
His future, looks back upon his present and beckons him
to make a greater speed.
I
ought also to say that most of us, not, of course, the
undeveloped individual, are working much harder than we
realize in our physical waking consciousness. We are doing
many things at once. Part of our available consciousness
will be working with the affairs which find expression on the
physical plane. But other parts of our consciousness will
be at work on possibly many different activities on one and
on possibly more than one of the planes of consciousness
on which we are able to function. It
may be unwise for
us to try to do too many things at once on the physical
plane itself. It
may be very unwise for us to have too
many irons in the fire. But from the standpoint of the
larger consciousness we are likely to be doing many things
at once, and doing them well, too. And we might well be
regarded as sluggards had we not quite a number of irons
in our evolving fire.
Hence, while from one point of view I am right to
say that there is more of us engaged in the things of the
AWAKENINGS INTO YOGA CONSCIOUSNESS 435
physical plane than just the consciousness which we think
we perceive to be at work, it is no less true that we are
simultaneously at work on several of the other planes. We
are vast and we can express multitudes to adapt Walt
Whitman, who thought more of all we could contain than
of all we could express.
We are It is very useful, therefore, to practise this power of
Omnipresent
simultaneity, and to accustom ourselves to live in our larger
consciousness so that we use it for activities other than
those on which our waking consciousness happens to be
concentrating. While we are sitting at our desks writing
it is
by no means unlikely that we are in other parts of the
country in which we live, and that we are also in other
countries as well, doing all kinds of jobs
-
-helping here and
there, establishing thought-forms of various kinds, making
consciousness channels for various purposes, trying to in-
fluence this, that and the other person, succouring the
wounded, receiving the so-called
"
dead," investigating
conditions, striving to expand our own consciousness in
various directions, being present at meetings, at religious
activities, taking directions from our Elders, possibly even
preparing for our next incarnations, paying visits to the
moon and possibly even somewhat farther afield.
Some of us may be able to do as much as this, some of
us less, just a few of us more. And we can do all these things
while we are seated at our desk, or walking in the street, or
giving a lecture, or enjoying ourselves at cinema or theatre.
We do not remember at least sorre of us may not.
Perhaps it is
just as well. We might well break down under
the strain of remembering. But we do more than we think
we do, and we use more of ourselves for what we are
doing than we think we are using.

And if the symbols I have been trying to describe
have reality for this student of Yoga, one or another will
occur to him as perhaps the heart of the event little or
large which has adjusted him in his kingdom of time to
the rhythm of the Eternal, which has adjusted the earth of
man to the Heaven of God.
Interestingly enough, I have found two principles
common to such stirring. The first is the immanent univers-
ality of the Mother-spirit of Life. The second is the no
less immanent universality of what I can but call Economic
Purpose.
These stirrings, these awakenings, these temporary
unions of Heaven and Earth, disclose to me how wondrously
all things are mothered by Life, even as we may think them
to be most motherless. The Motherhood of God, re-
membered in Hinduism most beautifully, and beautifully too
in what is called the Roman Catholic aspect of Christianity,
has been forgotten in some other religions and sects. Yet
no less precious than "
our Father who art in Heaven
"
is
" our Mother who art in Heaven."
And to him whose ways of life and living are reverent
is revealed in every tiniest life, and living round him, the all-
protecting Motherhood of God.
How much safer we should be, how much happier we
should be, how much freer we should be, how much more
peaceful we should be, were we to remember this Mother-
hood receiving it and giving it.
Each symbol in this form of Yoga is indeed glowing
with the Motherhood of the Point, whatever may be its
specialized functions.
God the Creator. God the Preserver. God the Re-
generator. God the Mother in them all.

As for Economic Purpose, I see how carefully husband-
ed are Life's resources, even amidst the seemingly most
extravagant.
I have said that God economizes. I see how true this
is, for even when there seems to be recklessness, prodigal-
ity, extravagance, waste, in truth it is that through all these
lies the quickest way available. And the Purpose suffers in
no way from the Economy.
I, therefore, see how vital it is that I should be econ-
omic no less than purposeful in my Yoga. I must use my
Yoga, not abuse it. I must husband to the utmost even
the smallest puff of force.
My Yoga must In me fulfil its Economic Purpose, for its

A Saviour is a
Vision rather
than a Tradition
The contemplation of celestial things will make a man both
speak and think more sublimely and magnificently when he comes
down to human affairs Cicero
Whither shall I
go from thy spirit ? or whither shall I flee
from thy presence
? If I ascend up into heaven thou [art] there :
if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou [art there] [If]
I take the
wings of the morning, [and] dwell in the uttermost parts of the
sea, even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall
hold me. -Psa/ms. CXXXIX, 7-10
Einstein's general theory of relativity, given to the
world in 1915, most interestingly seems to confer reality
upon appearances, for, first declaring that the motions of
bodies are in fact but apparent changes, he proceeds to
tell us that since we can give no meaning to the word
"
absolute," reality must rest in appearances. Thus do we
enter a world of relativities, of appearances which to all
intents and purposes are real. And I think there is
very
much to be said for this mode of world perception.
On the other hand, while it seems clear that we
cannot affirm any absolute whatever, we can at least de-
mand a conception of life which is so dynamic that it
involves a constant movement away from all
appearances.
Appearances must be subject to growth, to decay, to re-
generation, and with the changing appearances must come
the changing realities.
I think that one among the many great functions of
science is to permeate religion with the dynamic, so that

every religion grows more and more to the Divine Measure
of its Founder forward to the Founder, not back to Him,
for a Saviour is ever a Vision rather than a Tradition.
Einstein's relativity applies with very great force to
religion, for in the first place it exalts the spirit of move-
ment, while giving purpose (reality)
to movement-points,
but in the second place it
brings man face to face with God,
abolishing the intermediary of the apparent absolute, in
whatever form the apparent absolute may be presented
whether as dogma and doctrine, or as articles of faith, or
as a body of tradition, or as the essential channelship of the
priest, or as some man-made conception of God, or as
some anthropomorphic confinement of the life and teach-
ings of a Saviour within some idol-form and hall-mark of
authenticity.
The symbols with which we are here concerned must
also be regarded as appearances, with the proviso that
somewhere there may be, must be, reality correspondences
infinitely more real than any reality they may have as I
present them, or as they may be understood.
If readers of this book will in some faint mode of
vision try to gain a glimpse of each symbol as an abstrac-
tion transcending entirely the descriptions I have been
giving, and if then they will try to give something of a con-
crete form to each abstraction, somewhat of a tangibility to
each, making the effort with the whole force of their in-
dividual uniquenesses, not with their minds but with their
Selves, then perchance each will be able to evoke from
every symbol that appearance which is its highest meaning
for him, however different may be the appearance to
one from the appearance to another. Reality lies in
appearances.
Yet behind the reality of appearances lies another
reality, the reality of the transcendent causes of the reality
of appearances.
440 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
The Kingdom

Meinong, in his fascinating Theory of Ofa/ects, points
out that
"
behind the immanent object lies the transcend-
ent object, the real thing itself ; of this we can know no-
thing except that it is the cause, or part of the cause, of
the presentation of the immanent object . . ."
The symbols are all immanent objects. Behind them
lie their transcendent causes, out of which each student
may evoke the appearances appropriate to his Man-
uniqueness. Out of their transcendent causes I have
fashioned immanent objects of my own. It is written that
God made man in the image of His own Eternity. No
less is it true that man makes God in the image of his own
individuality, and he is
right so to do, for his very individual-
ity is a shadow of God and of his own Godhead.
Often and often I send forth my will on the road to
the transcendent, to the kingdom of causes. But as I look
into those distances in which the road loses its form and
shape, as a river loses form and shape as it
merges into the
ocean, I wonder If I am looking at mirages, into self-
constructed distortions of causes, or at intimations of the
very causes themselves.
Am I
looking at my projected self, or am I indeed,
seeing ?
I see these symbols as forms of the formless, as
causes from the causeless, as movements from the move-
mentless, but no less as the static from the dynamic, as
appearances from Reality.
I see them as successive, but no less as simultaneous.
I see them omnipresent, but no less as archetypes.
But what intrigues me most of all is that I see them
as having, together with other symbols not used for the
purposes of this book, spatial relationships in the Heavens,
just as there are signs of the Zodiac. As we enter sign
after sign of the Zodiac, do we also enter sign after sign
objectivized by these symbols and others not mentioned ?

Are we born under one or another of these symbols, as
we are born under one or another of the signs of the

If so, then in all
probability there is actual movement
on the part of the Realities which these symbols forth-
shadow. For it is said that the Zodiac itself moves forward
at the rate of about 54 seconds a year. But I am, of
course, entirely out of my poor little depth.
In any case, I feel impelled to believe that among the
constituent elements of each symbol are the servers of its
Power, the messengers of its Glory.
It is also borne in upon me that in a Divine Consum-
mation into a Point, there is also a gathering into the Con-
summation of a number of those who have accompanied
on His journey the Man now become Self-consciously
Divine.
When the Lord Buddha achieved the Great Liberation,
a number of individuals were gathered into it, though, of
course, at a far lower level. They become Arhats. I do
not know if
they had some intimate personal connection
with Him. But that they would thereafter join His Family I
have no doubt, whether or not to be closely related.
Similarly, at the Great Consummation there will be an
entry into the Family of Him who thus fulfils the measure
of our Divinity.
Such servers will be among the greater Adminstrators
of the whole evolutionary process, and will help to preside
over its passage through the signs of its unfolding. Among
them will be members of many Orders of the Divine Spirit
including the whole range of the Angel or Deva kingdom.
But there are also Administrators who "
belong
"
specifically to certain departments such being additional
to the Servers of the manifestation as a whole. There are
the Servers of the Web that is the Womb, Servers of the
Line, Servers of the Circle-Globe as such, Servers of the

Cross, Servers of the Svastika, and Servers of the Lotus

It seems to me that quite apart from, or in addition
to, the differentiations of function typified in the Rays and
otherwise, there is this larger differentiation, to each division
of which members of all the divisions with which we are
familiar will belong.
But this takes us into regions which, so far as I am
concerned, are purely speculative, and I am perhaps mak-
ing a constructive confusion worse confounded, not better
confounded, as I introduce elements which are more vision-
ary than visions."'

to foreshadow the attributes of life were putting themselves more,

Motion is the root of all. Life is motion , consciousness is

the One becomes the Many, then motion arises ;

If there be any truth in my conception of the seven
symbols associated with this particular form of Yoga, then
it must follow that they are primary qualities of all that we
call Life. They must each and all be inherent in atom, in
particle of dust, in universe, in spirit and matter (insofar as
we may care to distinguish between the two), in time, in
space, in light, in sound, in form.
It must also follow that everything which is inherent in
the symbols must also be inherent in Life, since they are Life.
Primary in them is the Ceaseless Breath, whatever this
may actually mean. We may call it

call it Movement. At least must we call it Restlessness,
even though we may not know what Rest is.
It is inconceivable to me that any particle of any
nature, any force of any kind, can be without movement of
some kind. Even in the most perfect vacua known to
occultism, ultimate movement is
present. Nature does
indeed abhor a vacuum, and refuses to have one in the
sense that she insists upon universal movement, however
imperceptible.
Both Einstein and Minkowski declare that
" we must
take care not to ascribe a state of motion to the ether."
*
This is, of course, assuming a distinction between what
Einstein calls "gravitational ether" and "the electro-
magnetic field,"
" or as one might call them space and
matter." To the electro-magnetic field, movement must
be ascribed, though Lorentz postulates elementary particles
of matter, non-electro-magnetic in character, which do not
possess the attribute of movement.
Still the time will probably come when science will
unite this space and this matter into one state of conscious-
ness, and this will then give us the universal Ceaseless
Breath which to Yoga and occultism is fundamental.
But the Ceaseless Breath is
primordial in what we can
only call a Point. I do not really know what a Point is.
But I
might hazard as a definition the statement that a
Point is
composed of a positive and a negative characteristic
the positive characteristic of what I am calling a Con-
summation, an accumulation, and the negative characteristic
of a Forthgoing, a discharge. And insofar as we may
speak of anything being self-contained, a Point is an ulti-
mate self-containment of these two elements. I have read
somewhere that Einstein regards the universe as a closed
space of finite size. I do not see the Point as of this
nature, essence of a universe as it is, though we are almost

compelled to tolerate such assertions while living within the
illusion of form. Fortunately, there are other scientists who
speak of expanding universes, as I am quite certain this
universe and all other universes must be, and their con-
stituent Points no less. A Point, such as I have been en-
deavouring to describe, is indeed an expanding universe, ex-
panding both as to its Consummation and as to its
Forthgoing,
the two being in fact interdependent. The Consummation
is
only such as we view it in terms of cosmic time. It is a
Consummation in a state of movement. It could not be
otherwise, formed as it is of the Ceaseless Breath. It is a
progressive Consummation, as its complementary charac-
teristic is a progressive Forthgoing. And the Point moves,
grows, in terms of its two constitutent elements. Whether
or not the Consummation keeps pace with the Forthgoing,
or vice versa, I have no means of knowing. While they
are interdependent this must be true the nature of the
interdependence is entirely hidden from me.
We may then perceive that if the conception of the
Point be primordial, then the whole of nature may be ex-
pressed, and must ultimately be expressed, in terms of
Points, or, if we like, of particles. Waves are points in a
state of energy. And the nature of the wave is deter-
mined by the nature of the point, or particle, or mass- -call
the ultimate microscopic end of the universe what you will.
This ultimate microscopic end is endowed with all the
characteristics of the macroscopic end, and there is
nothing
outside, Its activities are its characteristics. The process of
evolution consists in the intensification of these character-
istics, so that and at this point I feel myself to be
halted, for it is hardly explanatory if I
say, so that- -a
Godhead is achieved, a Divinity is reached. For what is a
Godhead, a Divinity ? I feel myself to suggest the idea of
Reproduction in exce/s/s. What else can a God profitably
do but produce Gods ? There is no satisfaction in the idea
446 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
that He goes on becoming more and more God, save as
His creative power becomes more glorious. So far as
we know, reproduction is the supreme attribute of all
evolving life, and by evolving I do not at all mean copying.
And if I
say that a God can best reproduce Gods, I mean,
therefore, that He can best do unto other
"
Men
"
that which
has been done unto Him not "
to create Man to be im-
mortal and make him an image of His own Eternity," but
to set Men on their road to immortality and to aid them to
become images of their own Eternities.
An All- We then come to another fact which definitely seems
pervading
Curvature to emerge from a study of this particular form of Yoga,
namely that the geometrical conceptions of the ancient
Greeks, as expressed, for example, in Euclid, deal with
what must be regarded as abstractions having an unknown,
if at all knowable, relation with occult observations. I must
not say that straight lines and straight-lined figures do not
exist. But they seem to me entirely at variance with such
reality as I think I have encountered. The Rhythm of
Universal Unity would seem to demand an all-pervading
curvature, to which principle I have not perceived any
exceptions, for even in the symbols of the vertical and
horizontal Lines curvature is inherent, and the Cross, there-
fore, is a curvature. As Einstein has said,
"
the funda-
mental concepts of the
'
straight line,' the '
plane,' etc.
. . . lose their precise significance in physics." The Law
of Spiritual Gravitation seems to demand curvature as an
element in its accurate expression.

Annie Besant
I have been trying to discover what really is Time. It
seems to me that it is
something very difficult to discover,
since it is a quality rather than a substance, and a quality
which is quite impossible to isolate so that you can look at
Time by itself, just as you might look at a colour or hear a
particular sound.
I
expect that the quality of Time itself has in some
mysterious way a kind of individuality just as we know that
a machine has an individuality of its own, or at least is
associated with an organism which we may call an entity.
This is a very difficult pathway to pursue, and is
hardly
relevant, perhaps, to my present interests.
Time Seems to be a definite quality of Being, both of
Being as unmanifest and of Being in its
aspect of the

evolutionary process at work. Hence, Time is a quality of
each individuality, whether asleep, awakening, or awake.
Whatever else we may predicate of Individuality, we must
certainly predicate Time. I find it difficult to define this
quality which is a veritable dimension of Individuality.
Perhaps I
might call it
"
expansion
"
or possibly
"
move-
ment," and I
might say that Time is the expansion quality
or movement quality of Individuality. But even where there
is no expansion, no movement, Time must still
persist
"
asleep
"
as is the statement in the Stanzas of Dzyan.
Without the quality of Time, there can be no expansion or
growing or moving on the part of Individuality. Take Time
away and Individuality has nowhere to go.
I
regard Time as the second dimension of Individuality,
and, of course, of all that constitutes Individuality. Space I
regard as the first dimension, so that Space is, as it were,
the Father of Individuality, and Time is the Mother. How
shall I define Space ? It is to me that Sea of the Unmanifest-
Manifest which is universal, all-pervading. When the Call
goes forth, of which I have been writing in this book, it
goes forth to Space, and such Space as is
qualitatively
equipped to answer responds to the Call, and enters with-
in the Ring-Pass-Not of the Circle-Globe. In other words,
it
undergoes a change of consciousness through the awaken-
ing of Time. The Father is alone, but when the Call comes,
He finds that it is not good to be alone, and Time, the
Mother, comes to join Him. Let us beware of pursuing
the path of enquiry as to what happens when a certain
quality of Space passes out of the unmanifest into the
manifest. All that can be said is that it is not less Space
than before, but not Unmanifest. I must leave it at that.
This Space is the substance of Individuality, and there-
fore its dominant quality. Individuality is
fundamentally
spatial, it is
impregnated with Spatiality, for it has been
part of the Sea of the Unmanifest. May we say then that
SOME NOTES ON SPACE AND TIME 449
Individuality is
Space become objective, the Unmanifest
become manifest, a portion of the Sea of the Unmanifest
become lashed into waves of awakening consciousness ? So
far as I can see, the Unmanifest is a kind of Substans of
Individuality, as well as it is substance. It is Substans in the
sense that there is to each individuality a background of
Space unmanifest. And through this very association with
the manifest, the Unmanifest moves onwards in the direction
of manifestation, just as all particles constitutive of an In-
dividuality grow by reason of their sharing of its life. Space
may be defined as the atomic Substans and indeed substance
of Individuality, of Consciousness, and its
potency is all the
more tremendous and unimaginable because in it leashed
dwells the essence of that irresistible power which makes
for Self-conscious Divinity. One realizes to the full the
frightful danger which might arise if it became within the
competence of man to let loose the power within an
atom. However much bombardment of the elements
science may undertake, the very unfitness of humanity will
bar it from making those ultimate discoveries which are for
Gods alone. How truly does the first Stanza of Dzyan tell
us that
"
Space is the Eternal Parent." Space is the Father
and Time the Mother, and all other dimensions are but the
children of their Union length, breadth, height and so on.
The We must not forget to notice that Space is
inherently
Individuality, both universal and individual. It is the Father of Individual-
mversa y

Universality. So is it that
Individuality and Universality are complementary character-
istics of every Man of the Sea, to use a phrase current
throughout my book. There can, in fact, be no Individual-
ity without Universality and no Universality without Individ-
uality. As I have been suggesting, the first process is the
Yoga of Universality, the second process is the Yoga of
Individuality, while the third process is the Yoga of In
dividuaiity-Universality.

I wonder how true it is for me to say that in the
beginning there was Space, and that Time, the Mother, lay
asleep on the breast of Space. And Space stirred and Time
awakened. And from Space-Time was born Individuality
and the quality dimensions of its nature. And Individuality
became crucified on the wheel of evolution, thus learning
to know its individual Divinity. And knowing its individual
Divinity, it also came to know its Divine Universality. And
so returned otherwise to Space which sent it forth.
I can see so clearly, as I think of these things, how
deeply imprinted upon Space is
every symbol of the form of
Yoga with which I am concerned in this book. The symbols
are formulae for the discoveries of the qualities of Space,
and they are formulae as well for the discovery of the
qualities of Time, upon which they are no less deeply
imprinted. They tell the Time the macrocosmic and the
microcosmic Time. They measure Space Space universal
and Space individual. I wish I could help you to gain some
imaginative or intuitive or other type of vision of Space
the Unmanifest, so that you might perceive within such
vision the very heart-beats of symbol after symbol in the
series disclosed to me by my Teacher. You might well see
in the whole of Space the spirit of the Point both in its
Consummation and in its
Forthgoing. You could see in it
the potency of the Web that is the Womb, the tremendous
vibrating power of the Line, and so on. I refer you to my
descriptions of the symbols for relating them to Space.
And remember also that they can be no less truly and
wonderfully related to Time. They show the intensity of
Time in its most microcosmic nature. But they also disclose
the Eternity which is the Universal Mother, parent of the
time-mothers which minister to all
evolutionary processes.
We may look upon Space as the Substance dimension
of Individuality and on Time as the Movement dimension,
realizing, if we can. that both Substance and Movement

Unmanifest, or unconscious.
Space is more solid than Self-conscious Space, than Space
in process of evolution. Evolution seems from one point
of view to involve a rarefication, so that the physical plane
we know around us is a rarefication of Unconscious Space
giving the physical plane the power to interpenetrate
Space just as the inner more rarefied planes of conscious-
ness are able to interpenetrate the physical plane of con-
sciousness itself. And yet, from one point of view, as I
have said in the course of my book, there is a greater
density, or intensity, on the inner planes than on the outer.
One seems to contact a greater solidity within than without.
I come to the conclusion that while from one point of view
there is
greater intensity, and therefore more apparent
solidity, as evolution proceeds and we pass from outer
to inner planes of consciousness, on the other hand and
from another aspect, we proceed from the Supreme Dens-
ity of Space Unmanifest to ever-decreasing densities as
Space becomes influenced by the activity of Time.
We have also to notice that Time moves under the
Law of Acceleration, so that in the higher reaches of
evolution, there is a Time which moves more speedily than
in the lower reaches. It is all very peculiar as one looks
at it, and therefore probably indicative of some missing
link whereby we should be able to reconcile the rarefication
of the evolutionary process out of solid Space with the in-
creasing intensification out of that very rarefication which
certainly gives the impression of increasing solidity which,

octaves of Solidity, so that we begin with Unconscious
Space at one end of the octave and ring the changes to
Self-conscious Space at the other end of the octave of the
scale of Solidity. And I
suppose that the quality of Solidity
changes in each note of the scale. I wish I could in some
way establish this octave of Solidity of Space in the great
circle of its being. I no less wish I could establish an
octave of Time. There are, of course, many different
times, not only one Time, even though from one point of
view Time is One without a second. We shall only be
able to understand Time when we are able to see that
there are a number of Time-octaves on each of which
there is Movement, on each of which there is Substance,
Individuality, Progression ;
and even then we shall have to
learn to perceive the relation between each of these octaves.
How wonderful it will be when in the far distant future an
instrument is constructed on which we can play the octaves
of Time, and another instrument is constructed on which we
can play the octaves of Space. I have not the slightest
doubt that our Teachers are able to do this, without
instruments at all.

THE WINGS OF DIVINE DISCONTENT
Oh that I had wings like a dove !
[for then] would I
fly
away and be at rest Lo [then] would I wander far off [and]
remain in the wilderness Psalms, LV, 6-7
For before this I was born once a boy, and a maiden, and
a plant, and a bird, and a darting fish in the sea . . From what
honour and how great a degree of blessedness have I fallen here
on the earth to consort with mortal beings ? . . . But at last are
they prophets and hymn-writers and physicians and chieftains
among men dwelling on earth ; and from this they grow to be
Gods, receiving the greatest honours, sharing the same hearth
with the other immortals, their table companions, free from
human woes, beyond the power of death and harm.- Empedokles
The Wmgs of | n the beginning Men had Wings, and could stretch
them gloriously to their full measure, but they did not
know how to fly. Yet they knew that Wings were for
flying. So they asked of God how they should learn to fly.
And into His Hands God took each Man and sent him
forth into the kingdoms of His own Nature.
In the first kingdom the Wings of Man stirred faintly.
In the second kingdom they stirred a little more. In the
third kingdom they stirred yet a little more.
In the mineral kingdom the Wings of Man began
slightly to flutter.
In the vegetable kingdom the Wings of Man moved
him to and fro.
In the animal kingdom the Wings of Man lifted him
from the ground.
In the human kingdom the Wings of Man caused him
to begin to fly. And when his Wings took him up into the
454 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
One Potential
Rhythm . Man

heavenly regions, Man flew away from the human kingdom
into the kingdom of Heaven itself.
So he flew up into the heights and down into the
depths that he might help his brethren to learn to fly as
he had learned.
In the end Man and his Wings were one.
^ * *
I think I
ought to state by way of clarification that I
am resting on the assumption that the Sea of the Unmani-
fest, which has been brought within the Ring-Pass-Not
Circle for alchemical transmutation into manifestation, is
composed of but one potential rhythm that which is to
energize a wave of
" Men
"
who shall pass, through king-
dom after kingdom of unfolding, through Manhood, to
Godhead.
For the purposes of this form of Yoga, it is
enough to
concentrate upon this one wave.
1
On the other hand, it should, I
hope, be clear, even
if
only from a gaze of circumspection, that by no means
only one wave characterizes the Sea as it thrills into mani-
festation. As one wave ripples through kingdom after
kingdom of unfoldment, there is another wave following
closely after it, as it ascends from one kingdom to another.
As we see so clearly around us with regard to the kingdoms
we have already traversed and conquered, not one kingdom
is left untenanted. Below us there are Men who are ani-
mals, below them there are Men who are trees and flowers
and other denizens of the vegetable kingdom. Behind
these are the denizens of the mineral kingdom, who in their
turn precede Men who are as yet within the limitations of
the still
younger kingdoms.
Wave after wave of the manifested Sea passes into
kingdoms below as wave after wave ascends into the king-
doms above.

The Svastika of

The Many-
armed Svastika
And we do not yet perceive, even though there would
be no difficulty in seeing had we the eyes to see, that
there are kingdoms beyond us tenanted by Those who have
belonged to waves preceding that to which our present
humanity as a whole belongs. Super-human Men have
gone before us, and we follow after Them, as there are
sub-human Men who follow after us.
By no means am I
suggesting that this is an un-
ending process. It has its limits. But I do not think any
useful purpose will be served by going into a matter
fraught with intricacy. It is
necessary to assume that there
is wave upon wave of successive Life impulses. But I need
not go further, although the interested student may be
recommended to study Man : Whence, How and Whither,
by C. W. Leadbeater and Annie Besant, The Pedigree of
Man, by Annie Besant, First Principles of Jheosophy, by
C. Jinarajadasa, etc.
Within certain limits, therefore, no kingdom of unfold-
ment is left untenanted, so that while there is constant
movement everywhere, the great Svastika of Churning is
ever fed with Men that it
may churn them into Gods as it
revolves. Perhaps its very revolutions are caused by wave
upon wave of Men weighing downwards, and thus causing
to rise upwards, its multitude of arms. Thus do we
perchance see that, while on the one hand we are helped
by Those who have gone before us, we are no less helped
I
hope the words " no less
"
do not seem an exaggeration
by those who come after us. On every spoke are those
who consciously or unconsciously help the Wheel to turn.
I
emphasize the fact that the Svastika is
many-armed,
not merely four-armed as is the Cross. The Cross is the
Mother of the Svastika. The Cross sets in motion the
many-spoked Wheel l
of Evolution which bears upon each

of its spokes a wave of
"
Men," which under the Law of
Adjustment it
dips down, lifts
up, and at last releases from
its
rhythmic and benedictory bondage as each wave in
turn reaches the appointed height.
The Symbol The Cross is the Silent Watcher of the Svastika. It is
Incarnations
ever the Divine Measure of the Svastika, for the Svastika
is its child. So do we see, as I have said before,
that these symbols of Yoga are incarnations of their pre-
decessors, and hold within their living the spirit of their
progenitors.
The Point incarnates into the Web that is the Womb,
yet remains the Point.
The Web that is the Womb incarnates into the Line,
yet remains the Web.
The Line incarnates into the Circle, yet remains
the Line.
The 'Circle incarnates into the Cross, yet remains the

The Cross incarnates into the Svastika, yet remains
the Cross.
The Svastika incarnates into the Lotus, yet remains the
Svastika.
The Lotus incarnates into the Point, yet remains the
Lotus.
The Point incarnates into that which is More-than-
Point, yet remains the Point.
Each symbol, however, is an individuality in itself as
well as a symbol of other individuality. Not only this, but
this very individuality, this unique life, is active everywhere

what it
may. The symbol is
symbol, and it is an independent individuality as well.
Once again do I seem to be measuring with words the
immeasurable. But I am constantly hoping that the measure
is elusive, so that while, as we seek it, we discover it, yet
we have it not.

Mystery
The Rhythm of

Discontent

Surely is it
unnecessary to say that the great rhythm
of Life is an unfathomable and impenetrable Mystery, as
indeed it must be, for we are seeking to measure Ultimates
with microscopic insignificances.
All we can do is to obtain a vague impression, so in-
complete and so inaccurate that even though from below
it
may seem as a brilliant light, from above it
appears but
as a feeble, flickering dimness.
If such impression dissatisfies and even confuses, it is
well. We have to look for our painting materials, to dis-
cover them, and to learn their respective absolute and
relative uses, before we can hope to begin the painting of
a picture of merit and truth.
I shall be happy if some of my readers declare as they
read this book :
"
Come now. This will not do at all. It is all
otherwise from my point of view." I shall be far more
happy if
they say this or something short of this than if
they
say:
" How wonderful!
"
and then go to sleep. In any
case, I do not want them to say it is
wrong. It
may be,
but it is not for anyone to say so save as he adds " from my
point of view." This is the saving grace of all true criticism.
I am hoping that this book will knock at the doors of
the Divine Discontent which lies within the hearts of all my
readers, indeed of all Men in all
kingdoms.
In the pre-mineral kingdoms this Divine Discontent
will be in deep, untroublable sleep. In the mineral king-
dom it will be stirring out of its unconscious sleep. In the
vegetable kingdom the Divine Discontent will be in the
realm of dreams. In the animal kingdom it will be awake
and will even be beginning to know. But in the human
kingdom Divine Discontent is not only awake, does not
merely know, but is
awakening to know that it knows. It
is becoming Self-conscious. And as development in the
human kingdom proceeds, Divine Discontent grows increas-
ingly conscious of its
glorious nature.

Each one of us must serve his Manhood by ardently
seeking to fulfil the fine rhythm of his human state, as he
has fulfilled in kingly fashion the fine rhythms of the king-
dom he has so far conquered.
But he must no less serve his Godhead by groping
inwards towards finer rhythms still, those of the highest
reaches of the kingdom he has still to conquer, end those
of the kingdoms beyond the human.
The wagon of his being is
already hitched to the star
of his Divinity. He has but to make them move in perfect
unison.

So to do demands a ceaseless refining of every ele-

last stand upon the threshold of the Darkness which is more
than Light, of the Silence which is more than Sound, of a
Radiance which is more than Rhythm.
At the Doors of So standing, he knocks upon Doors which have been
the Ineffable
y r
Mystery mightily exalted in the Scriptures of every faith. He gives
that knock to which alone the Doors respond, and passes
onwards into the Dark and Silent Glories of that Ineffable
Mystery which, in veil after veil, meets the Soul as it moves
from fulfilment to fulfilment. In the earlier stages indeed
are the veils heavy. But they lift one after another, even,
though Sir Edwin Arnold causes the Lord Buddha to say :
Veil after veil will lift but there must be
Veil upon veil behind.
The "Door" One of the other many significant biblical references
to the Door as a symbol is found in Ezekiel, XLVI, 1-3 :
Thus saith the Lord God ; The gate of the inner court that
looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days ; but
on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new
moon it shall be opened.
And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of
[that] gate without . . . then he shall go forth ; but the gate shall
not be shut until the evening
Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door
of this gate before the Lord in the sabbaths and in the new moons.
And that significant parable where the Christ warned His
disciples that only through the "door" should they enter
the fold, saying : "I am the door :
by me if
any man
enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and
find pasture."
*
St. Paul uses this symbol of the Door: " For a great
door and effectual is
opened unto me,"
"
a door was
opened unto me of the Lord.'
~
In Revelations we find the significant phrases : "Be-
hold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man.
can shut it

(III, 8).

and knock : if
any man hear my voice, and open the door,

"
(III, 20).
This symbol has been used in its fullest significance by
Dr. Annie Besant in
depicting the Five Great Portals on the
Path of Initiation. In The Ideals of T/ieosophy, towards the
end of the book, she writes :
" But when the White Brotherhood sent its
messenger,
the great disciple, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, who had
laboured so long, so nobly, in the service of her Master ;
when she in turn found another of the ancient group,
Henry Steel Olcott, and linked her hands with him in the
great work of founding in the world a Society, which stood
out as a messenger from the White Brotherhood and re-
proclaimed the Gnosis in face of the triumphant agnosticism
of the latter days of the nineteenth century ; when in
Europe it
pointed to the ancient Hermetic Mysteries ; when
in India it
pointed to the ancient Brahmavidya ; when within
itself it founded its Esoteric Section then again that cry
went out
* '
Awake, arise, seek the great Teachers and
attend.' For again the reality of the Teachers was pro-
claimed ;
again the fact that They could be found was an-
nounced ;
again the outer gateway was shown beyond
which stretches the path that leads to the inner ; so that
once more the narrow ancient Way was pointed to, without
doubt, without hesitation. Since that day some have entered
the outer Court, have passed onward to the inner Court of
the Temple, onward still until they have entered the Holy
of Holies, where the Teachers stand to give the o!d
Initiation.

Gateway, to become a candidate for treading the narrow
ancient Path ? The way to knock at that outer door is the
knock of Service to your fellows. That is the knock which
arouses the guardian of that Portal ; that is the word which
is the Word of Power which makes him unlock the Gate.
You say :
'
But what of prayer, what of meditation, what of
all the rites and ceremonies of religion, what of withdrawal
from the outer world, what of the jungle, and the cave,
and the life of renunciation ? You talk of service, but that
must be carried on in the outer world ; that takes up time
and thought and energy. How should service be the way,
when it must be carried on in the haunts of men ?

Quite
true, and yet it is the way. . . .
"It is the care for the welfare of the people, the

It is important to realize that what we call Initiations
are in fact expansions of consciousness which either occur
in the normal process of evolution, or may be hastened by
special process of meditation, study and action.
Just as there are individualities at various stages of
unfoldment in the human kingdom some savage, and
others at various degrees of civilization beyond, so towards
the end of life in the human kingdom an individual may
hasten his growth and gain mastery over a wider range of
consciousness. He may, if he so chooses, place himself
for training under a wise teacher, and through age-old
study, discipline and activity fit himself to receive from

Examinations
for Initiation
Continuous
Unfoldment
The Second
Birth into
Spirit
Apprentice of
the Hierarchy
without the help of a Master of Wisdom by passing what can
only be called an examination the main feature of which
is the testing of the candidate's power both to seek truth
successfully and to share it
generously with all who are in
need.
Each of the examinations is followed, if
successfully
passed, by an Initiation such as is described below, at least
so far as regards the first four. There is little if
any infor-
mation as regards the mysteries beyond, and it would be
improper for us to try to find out.
But I should like to suggest that, while of course the
Initiations, as are given below, are confined to those
members of the human kingdom who are nearing the
end of their long human pilgrimage, there are expansions
(and explosions, too) of consciousness taking place in every
kingdom of nature. In the animal, vegetable, mineral and
sub-mineral kingdoms expansions of consciousness are con-
tinuous, for the unfoldment of the life in the dust into the
life in the diamond is one long expansion of consciousness,
and I doubt if there are any short-cuts up the mountain-
side of growth in any kingdom save the human, towards its
close, and possibly also in the animal, towards its close.
There are also, of course, complementary expansions
of consciousness, both general and specific, in evolutions
other than human.
THE FIRST INITIATION
The first of the greater Initiations has a twofold result.
It is the birth of the individual Self-consciously into the
spiritual world, and is therefore his second and real birth, the
first being his physical birth into the material world. And
just as life after life up to a certain point he needs to under-
go birth into matter, so does he also, life after life up to a
certain point, need to undergo the second birth into spirit.
This second birth accords to him entry into apprentice-
ship to the great Hierarchy of Those who are Heads and
INITIATIONS ON THE PATH OF FULFILMENT 465
Communion
with the Law of
Life
A strenuous
Vigil of
Preparation
The Web that is
the Womb
Assistants in the real Government of the world, being
expert agents of the Law. This Hierarchy is called the
Brotherhood that lives from Eternity to Eternity. He can
hardly be called a member of this
"
Communion of Saints,"
but I think we may say that he is in communion with the
Saints and the great Fellowship of God.
The second result this Initiation produces is that it in-
tensifies the powers of consciousness, especially in the
realm of feelings, desires, emotions and aspirations. Indeed
has such intensification its great dangers as well as its
great
possibilities. And such intensification lifts the individual
into momentary communion with the Law of Life in the
One and the Many. He cannot hold this communion save
at intervals and in brief flashes. But the experience he has
changes him for ever.
Therefore is it that a strenuous vigil of preparation is
enjoined, and the guidance of a Teacher, extending over
many years. The kind of preparation involved is set forth
in simple and beautiful language in At the Feet of the
Master, a booklet available at any Theosophical Publishing
House.
This Initiation reflects in the individual the principles of
the Web that is the Womb. He is born into the Life of the
Spirit, and becomes in that Life a happy wanderer, freeing
himself from limitations. He is
beginning a conscious tread-
ing of his way to the Point.
First Initiation :
Hindu :
Parivrajaka, the Wanderer [between earth and
heaven].
Buddhist :
Sotapanna, he who enters the stream [that leads
to the farther shore].
Christian : Birth of the Christ Child [the Buddhic or Love-
Wisdom Principle] within the Cave of the Heart of a Virgin
Mother ;
"
Salvation "with Love-Wisdom the Initiate is

in the evolutionary scheme He has become as a

which covered the first three Initiations The symbol was that of
the

"
from Isis, and Osiris, the Father
God, or of the Mother and Father Principles of Divinity.
THE SECOND INITIATION
The second of the greater Initiations takes the in-
dividual from birth to eager youth. His apprenticeship is
proceeding, he is gaining experience, and a further intensifi-
cation takes place, after due examination, now in the realm
of the mind. He has justified his birth into the life of the
spirit. He has found himself in that life. He has estab-
lished himself in it, and, while still a wanderer, has in it a
definite habitation of his own construction, his
"
hut
"
or
11
home
"
in which he is
beginning to live. He is
beginning
to learn to wield power, and has to beware of the dangers
of pride, of self-conceit, of self-satisfaction.
This Initiation reflects in the individual the principles of
the vertical Line, for power descends upon him.
Second Initiation .
Hindu : Kutichaka, the Hut-Builder, he who has reached a
state of peace in the inner worlds.
Buddhist :
Sakadagamin, he who need return but once
more [to the weary round of birth and death].
Christian :
Baptism [by the Fire of the Dove or Holy
Spirit] followed by the Temptation in the Wilderness, [wherein
the Initiate is taken unto a high mountain and offered all that
ambition or pride could desire, but he refuses to take aught for
himself].
THE THIRD INITIATION
The third of the greater Initiations takes the individual
from youth to manhood, though not yet to real maturity.
Still, of course, his apprenticeship is
proceeding, he is
gaining still more experience.
At this particular stage there is a preparation for great
testings as to his power to descend into the very depths of
Life, into Life's prisons, yet remain unimprisoned and able

to carry his own Light into the dark places. In other words,
he prepares himself to descend into innumerable hells,
remain in them undisturbed, and even help to release from
durance those whose time for release has come.
This stage is marked in the Christian Scriptures by the
Transfiguration, for to help the individual to bear in peace
and fortitude the opportunities that are to come to him, he
becomes, at all events for the time being, aware of his
comradeship with the Saints and Saviours of the world, and
thus is indeed transfigured.
This Initiation reflects in the individual the symbol of
the Circle the beginning of the establishment by him of a
dominion over the kingdom that shall one day, in the in-
finitely distant future, be his. This is the first faint beginning
of a drawing of his own Circle round the Centre of his
Godhead, of his Kingship-to-be, the beginning of a
kingdom of which some day he will be God.
fhird Initiation
-
Hindu . Hamsa, a Swan, he who knows Soham-- "
That
am I."
Buddhist :
Anagamin, he who need not return, for he must
achieve the next Initiation in the same incarnation, and then, it
would appear, need not return into human incarnation.
Christian :
Transfiguration on the Mount of Holiness, in
company with Moses and Elias, symbol of his conscious unity with
the Brotherhood of the Saints and the Prophets. The Voice
from on High testifies,
"
This is
my beloved Son hear Him."
The shining with
"
exceeding whiteness
"
is
symbol of the descent
of the Monad who transforms the Ego into the likeness of his
own Glory. But that this Initiation is only a preliminary for the
next is hinted in the injunction to the disciples
"
to tell no man
what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from
the dead."
THE FOURTH INITIATION
The fourth of the greater Initiations takes the indi-
vidual from manhood to maturity, to the maturity of the
experience he has garnered through many lives of unfold-
ment with the aid of the three preceding Initiations.
468 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL

He goeth forth

Still his apprenticeship continues. But the time has
now come for him to test his own powers as they have
never been tested before. Constantly has he been rising
into the heights, with only the lesser falls to give him
further strength.
Now he must win Eternal Light, the Light that is called
Nirvana. Now must he enter Heaven for ever by making
a heaven not only out of all the joys of the world, but no
less out of all the hells of the world.
He has glimpsed the Law of Life, that Law which
declares the unity of the One in all the Many.
Now he must embody the Law, and in his own person
vivify its action even in the darkest and most remote of
regions, where Light and Law would almost seem to be ab-
sent Does the Writ of God run in such regions as these ?
And to help him comes a glimpse of the Light of
Heaven, *as at his second birth there came to him a glimpse
of the Law of Heaven. Now he perceives, perhaps only
momentarily, that the many, all the many, are in the One,
as aforetime he saw the One in all the many.
At his second birth he went forth from his Centre and
found himself everywhere, Now he dwells in his Centre
and finds all life within him.
So he himself is now fortified to experience hells such
as he has never known before, and is at peace in them.
So does he experience the hells of others, strengthen them
to endure their hells insofar as the time has not yet come
for their release, and have the inestimable privilege of being
the instrument of the release of those whose time has come,
through the expiration of the obstructing force and his own
right of redemption, to be free once more in the normal
rhythms of Life.

He descends into his own hells and into the hells of
others, not in fear, nor in gloom, nor in any manner of

doubt, but in joyous triumph. And thus descending he
ascends with the human imprisoned sheaves he has gather-
ed, first into their heavens which now they may know once
more, and then into his own heaven of Nirvana, of the
Eternal Light.
Down into his own crucifixion, and among the cruci-
fixions of his fellow-men, and into those too of his younger
brethren in every kingdom of nature. Up into his own
resurrection, thus drawing his comrades, indeed the whole
of Life, nearer the resurrections which shall some day be
theirs.
1
The Buddhic consciousness now must become his for
ever. Now shall he learn to know the very essence of
Life. This Initiation reflects in the individual the two symbols
that of the Cross, the Crucifixion, and of the triumph
of the Cross, the Svastika, the Resurrection. In him, even
at this stage of his unfoldment, coming events are already
beginning to cast their shadows, their glories, before.
In miniature he has begun to know the Web that is
the Womb, the Line, the Circle, and now the Cross and
its immediate apotheosis the Svastika, the Fiery Cross. A
universe in shadow-miniature is
being born, to come out
of the shadows as from the Point shone forth the Web
that is the Womb.
The individual who is
ready. for the fourth Initiation
can safely descend into the uttermost matter of Hell,
because there has been achieved a perfect purity in the
great Lines of his Cross of Crucifixion the vertical of
Vivification, the horizontal of Fecundation. He may now
be stretched on the Cross of Fulfilment, for he is

THE FIFTH INITIATION
The fifth of the greater Initiations takes the individual
from maturity to Wisdom, from knowledge to Truth, from
experience to Self-Realization. He has conquered the
supreme heights of the human kingdom, and ascends
therefrom to the superhuman kingdom beyond, there to
be born again in the mighty third birth of the evolutionary
process.

The Law is His. The Light is His. Doing the Will of
God, He now sets His feet upon that Way which leads Him
to become the Will of God, thus becoming the very Life
of God. He is a Master, a Man who has entered into the
veritable, regions of Godhead.
He is no longer an apprentice. He is a member of
the Hierarchy, of the Great Brotherhood, of the Inner
Government of the world.
Entering into the Law of Life, He rose into the Light
of Life, and now is
beginning to be Life itself. He is

superhuman attributes and declared a being separate and apart, and is lost to

THE SEVEN PATHS OR CHOICES
Seven Paths of Service open before the Adept :
1. To enter the bliss of Paranirvana, taking the
Dharmakaya (Monadic) vesture, retaining triplicity but drop-
ping even the Nirvanic nucleus, to become perchance, in
some future world, an Avatara, or Divine Incarnation.
In Buddhism, this is called
"
entering the void of Clear
Light," or " the uncreate, unshaped, unmodified."
2. To enter Nirvana "
on the Spiritual Period," a
phrase covering unknown meanings, among them "
prob-
ably that of taking the Sambhogakaya vesture, retaining the
Nirvanic body and permanent atom, but none lower.
In Buddhism, this is the Divine Body of Perfect Endow-
ment, in which the five Dhyani Buddhas overshadow and
bless mankind.

3. To remain with humanity as a Nirmanakaya, one
of the Guardian-Wall of Saints who fill the spiritual reservoir
of power a path of great sacrifice.
4. To join the Staff Corps of the Logos, train-
ing himself to do any type of work needed in any part of
the solar system, a very difficult path to which an aspirant
can dedicate himself at the Fourth Initiation.

5. To pass on to the next Chain of Worlds (or incar-
nation of the Planetary Logos) to aid in the building up of
its forms.
6. To join the Cosmic Elemental Devic Hosts to
work where stationed in the solar system as distributors of
Power and builders of Form.
7. To remain with humanity as an Official of the
Hierarchy, a path which requires constant physical in-
carnation.
AND BEYOND
I know that there are what may be called Initiations
beyond even those to which there is
passing reference
below. I believe that the Godhead as unveiled in the Point
still further unfolds the mighty Divinity already achieved.
Indeed, if there be any word at all
positively conveying the
idea of infinitude, it is the word Divinity.
I am also disposed to conjecture that, in some way
entirely beyond my understanding, that process whereby a
new evolutionary era is set in motion is
part of an Initiation
in which the Godhead-Point reaches yet another height.
It seems to me that in
making the great sacrifice of the
Web that is the Womb and the great sacrifices of the
Line, the Circle, the Cross, the Svastika and the Lotus, the
Godhead-Point is
ascending a Ladder rung after rung. For
sacrifice in its truest meaning of making holy is the royal
road, the Yoga road, to union and to power.

Therefore, it seems to me, we watch a God performing
a transcendental Act of Yoga, thereby reaching an Initiation
of inconceivable grandeur, as we see His Tapas of the Web,
His Tapas of the Line, His Tapas of the Circle, His Tapas
of the Cross, His Tapas of the Svastika, His Tapas of
the Lotus.
And the mass of lives He thus

holy, with His own Divinity, rise up to bear witness to His
Yoga as the power which set in motion the Wheels of their
Divinity.
You and I, and all life in every kingdom of nature,
bear witness to His sacrifice as we learn to understand it.
So does He justify the opening to His entry of the Doors
of an Inner Sanctuary, and so do we ourselves, thus testi-
fying, earn the right to turn our eyes to one of the Outer
Courts of one of the lesser Sanctuaries, that we may
move towards it and some day knock in the way appointed
for the opening of its Doors.
As we study this form of Yoga and other forms, and
grow in the spirit of their pathways, so do we cease to look
in vain or in doubt for an Outer Court of Refuge and Truth.
Our footsteps are guided by those who have gone before
us on one or another of these pathways, and at last we see
in the distance tha shadow of a Temple, dim almost as a
mirage, elusive almost as a will-o'-the-wisp, yet slowly gain-
ing definition, and at last shining into our eyes in gorgeous
colours and majestic lines. Then do we hasten still more
quickly, and in a supreme moment we give the knocks of a
call which cannot be denied, and, with the help of our
guide, we pass within to receive in a Holy of Holies, and in
a sublime setting of colour and of sound, a jewel for the
Crown of Kingship which shall one day be ours.
And so do we continue our pathway until we reach
another Temple, and in its sacred shrine win yet another
jewel. Into a little Crown a Coronet these jewels are

how they do in fact form octaves of all kinds. In various
degrees of modulation they form a whole range of symbol-

many.

But we could also view this symbol-octave in an aspect
of a Circle of Descent as well as in an aspect of a Circle of
Ascent, But so to do would involve us in intricacies not
germane to this form of Yoga.
The theme of octaves, and the whole conception of
the fundamentality of colours, sounds and forms leads to
very interesting speculations as to the octave principle being
at work in all the principal spans of living.
Bacon, in his garb as Shakespeare, gave an octave of
the ages of an individual life. I find myself constantly
thinking of a colour, a sound and a form octave as charac-
teristic of every seven-year period of an individual's life- -
the nature of the colour, sound and form depending upon
a number of important considerations.
First, there is the Universe note and colour and form,
distinguishing it from other universes. In terms of colour,
this will be typified by the colour of the Sun- orange.
Then there is the colour of the Earth green. Then there
is the colour of the individual Man himself. Then there is the
colour of his Ego, his agent-in-charge of the personality and
its various vehicles. Then there is the colour to the intensi-
fication of which any particular incarnation is dedicated, so
that in due course a Rainbow may be established with one
colour dominant and another colour sub-dominant.
The same applies to sounds and forms the Universe
sound and form. The Earth sound and form. The sound
and form of the individual Man himself ; the sound and
form of his Ego ; the sound and form to the intensification
of which any particular incarnation is dedicated.
And even when we have shown how elaborate is this
whole idea both in terms of colour, sound and form, we
have still to remember that some Men are sound-Men,

While for many years educational psychologists have recognized the
responses of visual, auditory and motor types, Dr. Montesson in her recent
courses classified these as Visual reaching its apex in the Chromatic (colour)
faculty ; Auditory with its apex in the Musical ,
Stereognostic or Motor with its
apex in the Tactile faculty, the ability to sense form

others are colour-Men, and there are also form-Men, as to
their dominances. Men are exceedingly complicated crea-
tures, since not only do they vary as above suggested, but ir*
each case the dominant note has either a colour, a sound
or a form as sub-dominant, and so on.
If I wanted to be very confusing indeed, I
might
most truthfully add that there is an intimate relation between
every single Man of this universe and some corresponding
Man in some other universe. The twin-soul idea has a
farther-flung reality than we generally imagine.
And, of course, all this involves the very significant
fact that each colour, each sound, each form, has its Lord
on earth, in the universe, and in the Beyond -a Hierarchy
of Lords.
Some day there may arise a scientist who will discover
how to distinguish, in every kingdom of nature, between
the colour-Men and the sound-Men and the form-Men,
establishing the nature of their respective differentiations.
Then will arise a Luther Burbank to devise wonderful
ways and means whereby the growth of each type on its
own pathway may be rightly stimulated, not only in the
vegetable kingdom, but in the mineral and animal kingdoms.
I conceive of the discovery of those who are the
kings of these sub-human kingdoms, as, for example, the
jewels of the mineral kingdom, and through these wilt
flow the great forces of fructification, so that the older
Man in each kingdom will be caused to stimulate with his
awakened kingship the less opened kingship of his younger
brethren.
And then I conceive of an /Esculapius giving a new
direction to the establishment, maintenance and restoration
of health through colour, sound and form, and through
the connecting of each Man with his dominant note as the
most potent force to help him. It is
interesting to note
that singing is now said to bring relief to blood-pressure.

If you are at all
wondering as to the purely form-
octave, I
may suggest to you that there are Point Men ;
Web Men ; Line Men, among whom I count myself ; Circle
Men, Cross Men, Svastika Men and Lotus Men. Of course,
each one of us is all these, but some of us are dominantly
one or another of these forms. I am Line, Sound and
Colour, in this actual order.
I will leave you to ponder over the significance of this
form idea, asking you to bear in mind that a partial key to
it lies in the conception of each Man as a servant of a
Colour, a Sound or a Form, on the way to become a Lord
of one or another of these.
But to return to the successive seven-year periods of
an individual's life, may we not conceive that while there is
a sound, a form and a colour fundamental to each period,
no matter what the actual nature of the individual Man,
each Man has his own individual colour-note, sound-note
and form-note presiding over a seven-year period. Indi-
vidual needs determine the nature of these colours, sounds
and forms.
Each symbol is the servant of a Cycle. So far as forms
are concerned, it is borne in upon me that the first seven
years of a child's life are dominated by the Web that is
the Womb ;
The second seven years by the conception of the Line
within the Web ;
The third seven years by the birth of the Line ;
The fourth seven years by the flashing of the Line ;
The fifth seven years by the establishment of the
Circle ;
The sixth and seventh seven years by the formation of
the Cross, and its consummation in the Svastika ;
The eighth seven years by the birth of the Lotus, and
the remaining period by such flowering of the Lotus as is
possible.

Lotus Time
Those of us who are over fifty-six have the supreme
felicity of being in our Lotus time. I wonder, do we all take
full
advantage of this Lotus time of ours ?
There is a sound, a colour and a form motif for each
seven-year period, and the richness of its expression entire-
ly depends upon the stage of advancement of the indi-
vidual. His Lotus time may be a glory, or it
may be almost
entirely bereft of the Lotus spirit, just the shoot, no leaf
nor flower. His Svastika time may be splendid in its
sweep-
ing majesty, or it
may be lamentably sluggish. His way of
the Cross may be beautiful in its spirit of service and
sacrifice, or it
may be a way of selfishness. His Circle may
be far-reaching, or it
may be shrunken. His Line may
flash in splendid aspiration and idealism, or it
may be dim
and low.
And in the Web period he may well be made or
marred, so that the forms will shine in their radiance or be
dull in their futility. Many an incarnation of an individual
has been utterly marred by the ignorance, or even worse,
by the selfishness, of those who should be the friends of
the growing God- -his parents, guardians and teachers.
Many geniuses die young in years because they hasten
through these divisions more quickly, so that Lotus time, a
time of deep beauty, comes to them early. To be young
in Lotus time is one of the glories of life, for the Lotus
amidst a setting of youth is far more splendid as a rule
than a Lotus in a setting of old age. I
say "as a rule,"
for a flowering Lotus in the majestic setting of age is no
less wonderful than a flowering Lotus in the quickening
setting of.
youth. Where there is the consummation of age
in the spirit of youth, there indeed is the Lotus in perfect
form.

deeply into the realities which these various symbols em-

Reality and perceive it
everywhere. We perceive the

by no means difficult for me, for
example, to see in those around me, in each one of them,
a flashing forth of these formulae in all their brilliance of
colour, sound and form. In each individual all are simul-
taneously present as concentrations of force. Each formula
expresses in its own terms the Ceaseless Breath of God, so
that it becomes clear that this Breath is the very Life of
God Himself.
It may well be asked what I mean by the word
" God

which I feel constrained so constantly to use.

fashioned in the likeness of Man? Yes, if the words

Man but God. There is no God but Man, using the word
"Man" to signify every evolving individuality of every
order.
But I am using the word "God" to signify Man of
every order of evolution, raised to the nth power. I use the
word to indicate that Transcendence which we sometimes
call the Absolute a word which we can only dare use as
we indicate by it our recognition of a Beyond the Relative,
or at least the possibility of such a Beyond. And such rec-
ognition implies the realization inherent in every individual-
ity of a Beyond outside all limitations, whether actual,
imagined or ideal. In other words, there is inherent in
each one of us that movement which is as ceaseless as the
Breath of God.
I use the word "
God
"
to imply such ceaselessness, but
I feel at liberty to use it to indicate a speck of dust or a
galaxy of stars. God is
everywhere. God is
everything.
God is individuality, universality, totality. And He is the
negation of all these no less.
If I
pray to God, I am praying to myself. If I
pray to
myself, I am praying to God.
Each one of these symbol-formulae is a scintillation of
God. Therefore, must I see each one of them in every
God in every kingdom of nature. And as I
bring each one
of them little by little into perspective in my own being, so
do my eyes slowly become accustomed to seek them and
find them in the beings of others. So, too, do my ears
slowly become accustomed to listen for them and to hear
them in every being. And their pulsating rainbow colours
and sounds and forms gradually lift me into a world ir>
which no voice need be heard, but in which each colour
and sound and form speaks its word of power, offering the
homage of its glory at the throne of its God.
Each symbol, because it is real, has its Lord, who is

its nature.
How wonderful it will be when Man, in the higher
reaches of the human kingdom, knows his colours, his
sounds, his forms, and uses each and all of them where-
with to sing his own song, his unique song, of Joy unto the
Lord, His Lord, Himself !
This form of Yoga is, I venture to think, a very direct
approach to such knowledge. It is indeed a Yoga of
forms, of colours, of sounds, and no less a Yoga of
fragrances.
And it will be well performed when its students have
learned to compose the essence of their beings in the
musics of colour, of sound, of form and of fragrance.
We are privileged to have about us the mighty revela-
tions of their greatest selves in the paintings, the sculptures,
the pieces of architecture frozen thought-forms as these
have been so truly called the music, the words, the actions,
the daily lives, of men and women who have discovered
their own essential natures beyond the discoveries the rest
of us have made.
Those who are masters in their revelations of the
splendours of their being reveal themselves in a measure
of glory, and call from their glory to ours.
A master-painter does not merely paint marvellously,
with an inconceivable genius of creative power. His pictures
are marvellous and have their own unique marvellousness.
But they show him forth in his own essential glory, even
though they have a glory all their own. When we look
at a Rembrandt we are looking at Rembrandt. And
what is more, we are looking at ourselves in terms of
a mode of that Universal Rhythm outside which there is
naught.

It is the same when we listen to a mighty orator.
We are listening to his words, but we are also listening to

It is the same when we look upon a life being beauti-
fully lived, perchance in utmost obscurity. The individual
may be doing this or that, living in this way or in that.
But if it be beautiful living, in whatever terms, we are
looking at a Man drawing near tc his Godhead. And we
are looking at ourselves, perhaps as we are even now,
perhaps as we shall be sooner or later sooner, I
think,
because God is
shining upon us through and in one who is

If

in a glory is to become glorified.
Universal
Bombardment
'Universal
Exchange
One of the most beautiful sights is that universal
bombardment of every individuality by every other which so
demonstrably declares both the Unity and the Universality
of Life.
There is not a single individuality in any kingdom of
nature which, through its emanations of itself, is not stream-
ing forth its nature. It thus projects itself into its surround-
ings as infinitely as an atom dropped into the ocean forms
an infinitude of circles.
This being true of all individualities everywhere, we
see at once how there is a marvellously universal exchange
of the natures which constitute Nature's universality. Thus
THE UNITY OF LIFE 485

is it that Universality and Individuality become indissolubly

The Universality as such may I

and the infinite number of Universalities constituting Space
manifest and unmanifest, constantly bombard each single
Individuality constituting the infinitude of Individualities
manifest and unmanifest, though of the nature of such
bombardment I understand nothing at all save that the
bombardment consists of Life in its universal aspect.
So also is each Individuality ceaselessly bombarding
Universality, all Universalities, as well as every other Indi-
viduality. The stars you perceive in the heavens, and those
which you do not perceive, are bombarding you. You
give to every star. You receive from every star. The
whole world and all the worlds constitute a gorgeous display
of fireworks in which the smallest atom and the whole of
space are full of Light-Fire a universal, pulsating rainbow

There is no such thing as isolation. There is no such
thing as independence. Nothing can live alone, whether a
grain of dust or a royal diamond, whether a humble weed
or a noble tree, whether the smallest insect or the most
majestic animal, whether an atom or a person, whether a
race or a kingdom of nature, whether a faith or a nation,
whether a world or a star.
In each is Life individual and Life universal. And each
lives by receiving and by giving.
Let each individual take heed of these great Truths of
Life. Let each faith know that it is alive only as it
gives to
other faiths and receives from other faiths. Let each nation
know that it cannot live in isolation or independence, but only
in comradeship with other nations. Let every race know
its need of other races and the need of other races for it.
Death comes in the wake of all that makes for isola-
tion and' independence. The motto of Life is, as I have
486 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
chosen to be the spirit of my work "
Together . . .
Differently."
All persecution, all
tyranny, all
oppression, all demand
for isolation, belongs to dying and not to living.
The indifference of the world as a whole to activities
which emphasize comradeship, as, for example, the League
of Nations, is a sign of decay. And do we not see the
world decaying under our very eyes ? Let those of us who
know be awake, alive, and eager for the spread of Life,
eager for that Togetherness the very wealth of which is
the diversity which composes it.

the more discerning readers of this book on Yoga that to
each of the seven symbols in this form of Yoga is its Lord,
His priests, and in the outer court around the Shrine
wherein the symbol dwells, innumerable Men who, from
the beginning until the uttermost ends, are its worshippers,
its servers, and at last its priests, those who are evolving
under the magic of the Man who has achieved His
Godhead, and who form, as it were, His Court.

each of the symbols, of the Lord who is its Cause, and to
whom each symbol owes its projection, its embodiment, its
vehicle, its incarnation.

The Rhythm of
Projection
For Each his
Lord
God
Geometrizes
Under the Rhythm of Projection every Man, every
Individuality, in every kingdom of nature, is a reflection
from a far-off Divine Event, from a Divine Ultimate. The
veriest fragment, as we may regard it, looking through one
end of the telescope, traces back its
ancestry to a Divine
Ultimate, to a far-off Divine Event. To the divine nobility
of all
things the mighty College of Spiritual Heralds a.
very actual and living body bears emphatic and irrefutable
testimony. And while from one point of view, all Lords
are one, all symbols are one, all Lords are within us, all.
symbols are within us, from another point of view each one
of us traces his descent from one specific symbol, from one
individual Lord. But all Lords are one. All symbols are
equal in their differences.
Under this Rhythm of Projection, every Man traces
himself back to a Sound and to its Silence, to a Colour and-
to its Darkness, to a Form and to its Formlessness, to a
Fragrance and to that Heart whence all
Fragrances
come forth.
Every Sound has its Lord. Every Colour has its Lord.
Every Form has its Lord. Every Fragrance has its Lord.
There is the Lord of the Point that is the All, the Lord
of the Web that is the Womb, the Lord of the Line that is
the Awakener, the Lord of the Circle that Guards, the Lord
of the Line that heralds the Movement, the Lord of the
Svastika that Revolves, the Lord of the Lotus that is Glad,
But there are also the Lord of the Square ; the Lord
of the Triangles, with no doubt Assistants who preside over
all subordinate abstractions depending on the Abstr^t
Triangle ; the Lord of the Cross in all its many aspects,
and as the Consummation of the two great Lines of
Vivification and Fecundation ; the Lords of the great
geometrical figures such as the Platonic Solids ; the Lord
of the Pentagon, as also Lords of other figures of the
same race.

God geometrizes, and His mighty Spirits endow His

There are also, as may perhaps be more evident,
Lords of Races, of Faiths, of Nations, of Countries these
sometimes in groups of Cities, of Rays. Also are there
Guardians Guardian is the same as Lord of places of
worship, of great monuments, as, for example, the Ceno-
taphs, the Lincoln Memorial, the Holy Sepulchres in Jerusalem,
and Mecca, Lourdes, Chidambaram, and many others.
There are also Lords of great incarnations in the
mineral kingdom, such as the Niagara and the Victoria
Nyanza Falls, certain of the greater ranges of mountains,
pre-eminently the Himalayas, about which could be written
a volume of extraordinary information by any seer who
knows the Himalayas
*
for that which they really are both
the Mother Line of India and the Lotus Flower from
her stem.
But I must return to the symbols with which this* form
of Yoga is connected.
First, I had better make clear that, so far as I know,
each of the Lords or Guardians of the symbols has some-
what of a deva-human shape, but a deva-human shape
glorified, and in certain of its aspects unbelievably intensi-
fied. In addition to the all-pervading glorification which
causes the human shape to become intensely radiant, I
notice that the hair, the eyes, the mouth, the nose, the
hands and the feet assume a special quality indicative of
the particular rhythm to which the Lord belongs. In some
cases, for example, the hair streams like a flowing rainbow,
all
shimmering colour golden, purple, dark. In other cases
the hair is, as it were, more severe, long or short, but more
restrained. The eyes may be of any colour, including gold,
but will be as surfaces hinting at unfathomable depths, or
penetrating as rapier thrusts, or suffused with Mystery.

Inadequate
Descriptions of
Magnificences
Why the Human
Shape ?
Apotheoses of
Sex
The mouth and the nose will be specially expressive in
ways I find most difficult to describe. The mouth will never
be hard, but there may play about it a sternness or a
softness, a smile or an ascetic reserve. The nose will
reproduce many different aspects of force the Ruler, the
Sage, the Warrior, but always the Saint in His Holy Poise.
The hands and feet always seem to be vast reservoirs of
magnetism, glowing with magnetic force which flows from
them in constant streams. This fact gives both hands and
feet an appearance of length greater than usual.
But as I write these things I feel myself to be guilty of
a most reprehensible impertinence, as if I were dissecting
Them for the benefit of curious readers. I
only give these
brief and utterly inadequate descriptions so that the reader
may have some little idea of Magnificences he will some day
meet and reverence.
Why partly the human shape,
1
in any case ? Because
it is on the whole the most economical and effective for
high-powered Individuality. Any other form would be less
adaptable to the strain which must be placed upon it. The
male form seems to predominate. But the female form is
also used to a certain extent.
The Lord of the Point combines in
" Himself
"
the
two lines of force which we call male and female, words
whose ordinary connotations give an entirely misleading idea
as to what masculinity and femininity really are. The two
lines of force are balanced in Him. But when we come to
the other symbols there is a curious alternation. The Web
that is the Womb gives predominance to the feminine
force, so that its Lord would seem to emphasize what we call
feminine characteristics. The Lord of the Line (vertical)
on
the other hand is
typically masculine. The Lord of the Circle
reflects the characteristics of the Lord of the Point, while
the Lord of the Line (horizontal) reflects the characteristics

Reach out to
each Symbol
of the Lord of the Web that is the Womb. The Lord
of the Svastika reflects masculine characteristics. The
Lord of the Lotus has the characteristics which are domin-
ant in the case of the Point and the Circle. So we have
most interesting sequences Beyond-sex, Feminine, Mascu-
line, Beyond-sex, Feminine, Masculine, and then Beyond
sex once more.,
1
Each symbol is so eternal and fundamental that a God,
a Lord, a Guardian, becomes as it were attached to it,
embodies it in that deva-human form which is far more the
apotheosis of form than it is at all possible for us to
realize. From a certain point of view the human form is
the meeting-point of all forms, a kind of central exchange,
a middle point between the North and South of the evolu-
tionary process. Hence, from the very beginning we
speak of Men, whose middle point is man, and who be-
come Gods.
I think that a student of this particular form of Yoga
will be well advised to consider to which Life-Symbol he
seems to belong, allowing for the probability that he will
be unable for a long time to come to any accurate conclu-
sion as to the precise inclination of his curvature, the more
so since we all
belong to all
symbols even though specially
to one.
I should certainly recommend the practice of a deep
and well-formulated Silence before each of the symbols, a
reaching out to each, an invocation of each, not merely as
an act of homage, but also as a mode of examining the
relative intensity of depth achieved with symbol after sym-
bol. This may afford some indication as to the particular
symbol of which the student is a projection.
1
It is interesting to note that C. W. Leadbeater in The Science of the
Sacraments, p. 243, observed this play of sex also in the Rays, stating
"
the
fourth and fifth Rays are predominantly masculine, the third and sixth Rays
predominantly feminine, the second Ray dual but about equally balanced,
the first Ray dual but with the masculine intensified, and the seventh Ray
dual but with the feminine intensified."

Furthermore, as I have already suggested, it is
very
useful to "
see
"
each symbol in everything around, first one
symbol and then another, and then the symbols together
as in oneself, in others, and in the Individuality-lives in
every kingdom of nature. Each symbol is inherent in the
evolutionary process, both as to its broad sweeps and as to
its minutest details.
If
you ask me as to what shape the composite symbol
takes, the symbol which expresses all the symbols, I can
only answer that such a symbol is not a conglomeration of
all the forms of all the symbols, but is the heart of them
all, and to me the Lotus symbol somehow emerges as the
Symbol composite. I see it
everywhere in the Point, in
the Web that is the Womb, in the Lines, in the Circle, in
the Cross, in the Svastika, and in itself as the apotheosis of
them all. The Lotus vanishes into the Consummation and
appears- again in the Forthgoing.
I should like to insist on the immediacy of these great
Lords in all
living. There may be a tendency to regard
Them as far-off abstractions. They are the very reverse of
this. They are indeed "
nearer than hands and feet."
They are more intimate to us even than ourselves, for They
are our Selves.
Let me suggest to you that in our very individual lives,
indeed in the lives of each Individuality in every kingdom of
nature, these great Lords are Immanent. They are con-
cerned with us even in the details of our living, and attend
in ways incomprehensible to us the majesties of our in-
carnations. *
When a child is to be born, the Forthgoing of the
Point is invoked to set in motion the vibration of Descent.
The Lord of the Point gives the assent. A man and a
woman spin a Web, becoming father-mother, and a Line
is drawn between Heaven and Earth a child is the uniting
Rod of Power.

What is called in Christianity the Baptism is the Circle
which forms itself about the Line. In every faith this
Baptism, this dedication of the child to the high purposes of
his descent into physical matter, is observed, however much
in ignorance of its effect.
Over the spinning of the Web presides the Lord of
the Web that is the Womb, and the wondrous Angel of
His Presence, She who is so truly called the World Mother,
is round about the birthing, a veritable Heaven lying about
the child in his infancy. But the Lord of the Line makes
the contact between Heaven and Earth that the vehicles of
a Man may be formed therethrough. The Lord of the
Circle presides over the Baptism, while the Lord of the
Line of Fecundation attends that which is called the Con-
firmation, whereby the child is intended to achieve Self-
consciousness. As a Rod of Power between Heaven and
Earth the child is established upon earth. As the Cross
the child is established in strength, receives the Holy Ghost
" for the sweet savour of a Godly life," and is linked with
Holy Oil to his very salvation itself. So does he become
a Cross within a Circle, and his Lords, through Angels of
Their Presences, are round about him.
Then begins the life of the youth, and the Lord of
the Svastika appears to help him on his way. Splendidly
revolves the Svastika of his Being, its colours flash from
light to light, its rhythm waxes from the simple notes of
striving to the thunder notes of conquest. At last there
looms before him the radiant and majestic Figure of the
Lord of the Lotus, for he should have achieved a Lotus
Flower as his incarnation's end. Sad will it be if no Lotus
be his. I would fain think that there is no life of any
kind anywhere which does not blossom into some form
of Lotus.
In Hinduism there are what are called the four
Ashramas or Houses, reminding us of the Houses of
494 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL

Union
Astrology, the four divisions of a life's span. There is the
House of an individual's Youth, marked by the symbols of
the Point, the Web that is the Womb, the Line, the Circle,
the Cross within the Circle. Then there is the House of
the Householder, in which the individual lives the family life
with all its responsibilities, anxieties and joys. In this House
the Svastika whirls, as it does in the next House the
House of the Individual as he begins to look forward into
the vaster future, releasing himself from the more earthly
ties, yet still
belonging to earth to give of his wise counsel
and experience. At last he enters the House of the Lotus,
the House of one who prepares for an Ascent into that
heaven from which he descended, but a heaven more
glorious because of his Descent into earth. Still does he
dwell on earth, but Heaven is
rising above his horizon and
he prepares to move onwards on his way, gathering in the
sheaves of his harvesting, and taking them with him on his
farther journey.
Brahmachari Grihastha Vanaprastha Sannyasa :
these are the Samskrit names for these great Houses or
Ashramas.
In the midst of this cycle it is
likely that a new cycle
of Forthgoing will be begun when the appropriate period
for marriage is reached.
It
ought to be quite unnecessary to insist that a
marriage without ceremonial concomitants, such as a purely
civil marriage, withholds much if not most of the wonderful
benefit a real marriage confers not only upon the actual
participants but no less upon each and every Man ^in-
carnate through it.
Apart altogether from the benedictory activity of the
Lords I have already mentioned, reduced to a minimum if
available at all in a civil marriage, the ceremonial of mar-
riage, no less than the ceremonies of birth, baptism and
confirmation, make certain changes in the inner bodies of
THE LORDS OF THE SYMBOLS 495

the man and woman concerned, so that the union of the
physical bodies may be preceded by a union of certain of
the inner bodies themselves. There comes about a certain
commingling of the astral bodies of the participants, and
also even of the mental bodies a union of these so that
the holy covenant which is made on earth may be but
the outward and visible signs of holy covenants made
within.
It will, I am sure, be understood that a civil marriage
does little to make these deep changes, though even a
ceremonial marriage, as a ceremonial baptism or confir-
mation, may not do much more. So much, of course,
depends upon the reverence of the two persons as they
approach the Sacrament of Marriage. It is the spirit of
reverence which is so lamentably lacking in these days, and
if so many marriages end in rupture, it is
largely because
of an all-pervading irreverence. " With this ring I thee
wed ;
my truest love I thee pledge ; with my body I
give
thee reverence, and with all my strength I thee shield,"
says the real ritual of marriage. Yet, as we see, almost
every marriage is an occasion for crude ostentation, fashion
and other irreverences.
It cannot be expected that any of the great Lords
who help to make straight our evolutionary pathways will
participate more than to the smallest extent in unrealities,
if indeed They will participate in them at all.
The whole of life is one great sacrament, one wonder-
ful ceremonial. It is an act of magic, a mantra. And
there are occasions when it rises into heights, as in the
case of all the sacraments I have mentioned. At such
times Heaven draws near to Earth, and the Lords of Life
draw near to Their sons. If then there be desecration and
degradation, what wonder the condition of the world with
its wars and hatred. So true to life is ceremonial, provided
it be real and not the artificial substitute so devastating

must needs make his own. And even those who reject all
ceremonial, often for most understandable reasons, still find
it
necessary to them, though they may not call it ceremonial.
We ourselves are bundles of ceremonies and ceremonial.
In all other kingdoms of nature marriage is indeed
the Act of God, or Nature. In the human kingdom it
has largely become the act of man. It must become
the act of Gods. So will it become once more the Act
of God.
I should like to advert to the importance of realizing
that the Nation-State should have its ceremonial activities
no less than the individualities composing it, so that the
Lords of Life, and in particular the Lord of the Nation-
State, may be able to function more effectively from above
as aid .comes to Them from below in the form of constant
reverence.
The birth of an individuality should synchronize with a
Ceremony of Adoption into the Nation-State. Elsewhere
I have written :
"
The ceremony of entry on the civic roll
takes place at birth. On a day set apart, say, the first
Sunday afternoon of each month, the State's newest
citizens are recognized. In a ceremonial hall, a Hall of
Fame, which every city should possess, decorated with por-
traits of the world's great people and the nation's noblest,
a representative of the State, or a leading citizen, delivers
a short address of congratulation to the parents. A hand-
somely engraved certificate of citizenship is then presented.
A small book of a simple nature dealing with the responsi-
bilities and ideals of citizenship is
given to the parents, to
be handed to the child as soon as they consider he can
understand it. The ceremony concludes with the parents
reciting the Affirmation of Allegiance in the children's
behalf."

There may well be music and some actual form for the

I have suggested that at the age of fourteen years
there should be admission to Junior Citizenship in some
formal and happy way. Then, either at eighteen or twenty-
one years of age there should be admission into Full
Citizenship.
In due course there should be a recognition by the
Nation-State of the ceremony of Matrimony.
Every taking of office in the Nation-State should be
the subject of some small official event, including an
Obligation to serve the Nation-State honourably and whole-
heartedly.
At a certain age all citizens who have rendered signal
service to the Nation-State, or at any time if desirable,
should be admitted to the Roll of Honour of the Nation-
State. Faithful service of any kind should always have
great honour.
And then there should be the State's Farewell at what
we call death.
Such activities will certainly draw nearer to the com-
munity its Guardians and true Rulers.

The pupil has to turn himself inside out, and maintain a

the pupil, therefore, a man whose higher vehicles are a funnel
open to the highest influences from his Master, while his lower
vehicles at the bottom of the funnel have been trained into the
constant habit of radiating those influences out upon others This
makes him a perfect instrument for his Master's use, for the trans-
lation of His force to the outer planes C W. Leadbeater
I want to make very clear that true Yoga is the
Yoga of Wise Action, that action which serves the
three great purposes of Creation, Nourishment and
Regeneration.
Creative Activity may be in any field of consciousness.
Nourishing Activity may be in any field of consciousness.
Regenerating Activity >may be in any field of consciousness.
But it is of urgent importance to remember that the true
Yogi is a channel between the veritable Life of Yoga and
all
living things. He may derive individual benefit from,
being a channel. He may grow in spiritual and other stature
from being a channel. But his glory is in his channelship,
that he is
privileged to be a means of communion between
the Heaven of Happiness and Fulfilment and the Earth of
Endeavour and Hope.
He learns to forget himself, or rather to remember
his everlasting Self, in the life which is poured through him.

"

Each student who reads this book should choose his
Yoga, should choose those to whom he fain would be a
channel, thus to enter into Yoga in a spirit of dedication.
If, to use that splendid Yoga simile of the Holy Grail
each one of you will fashion himself in all his bodies into a
pure and holy Cup of Aspiration and Dedication, then in-
deed will the Wine of Power be poured into the Cup to
overflowing, and while the Cup will be ever full, it will be
so filled to overflowing that a constant stream of Power will
descend upon the field of the student's Yoga and fructify it
with the mighty blessing of Those to whom all fields are dear.
Let each student choose the mode of his Yoga and
live each day and night so that, being worthy of the blessing
of the Gods, the spirit of grateful thankfulness rises up as
incense on his pathway from men and from all other living
things.
Let him choose the mode of his Yoga, and make living
in his life the symbols of its eternity. Where will he erect
the altar of his Yoga and worship thereat ?
Shall he join those who create, and in the very
present fashion the glories of the future ?
Shall he join those who nourish, and in the very

Shall he join those who regenerate, and in the very
present remind each living thing that it is God, and
that no darkness on earth can ever quench the Light of its
Divinity ?
Shall he be a Builder of Bridges in the spirit of such
choice ?
If he chooses the first path, will he dedicate his
Yoga to his art, to his philosophy, to his science, to
his ardent dreams for the happy and eager living of life

Perhaps in a way will he choose all three paths. But
there will ever be one trodden by his immortal soul, and
perhaps he already knows to which his feet have been

Every bridge is a bridge between a less and a more.

shape the ignorance may take, to an abode of truth

to build a bridge, or maybe many bridges ?
Always is it of the stuff of the understanding which is

scious channel must each be whose Yoga is
becoming
his own.
And let us ever remember that wherever there is life
there are the ministering servants of God. The tiniest
fragment of life in every kingdom of nature is
encompassed
by the blessing of God bestowed through one of His
servants a spirit of His Spirit.
In our Yoga, through our Yoga, we join the mighty
army of God's ministering messengers, thus, by serving
God, becoming Gods and gaining the power to rule a
world ourselves.
DHARMA
"
Dharma
"
is
variously translated as Law, Truth, Duty, and is
usually considered to apply to
"
the obligations into which every
man is born, the obligations which surround him from the moment
of his birth ... to the family, the community, the nation ... It is
not an arbitrary thing but a natural one . . . Out of that funda-
mental idea of Dharma comes the thought that the first thing in
human life which makes it
possible is the fact that that obligation
is recognized and righteously discharged." Annie Besant.
Dharma also means that innate Law of a man's own being, his
own Truth, his own Righteousness, which marks the line he must
take to fulfil his future goal. It is in this sense that the Bhagavad Gita
says :
"
Better is one's own duty (Dharma) though destitute of merit
than the well-executed duty (Dharma) of another" (XVIII, 47).
THE THREE GREAT PURPOSES OF YOGA 503
Dr. Besant commenting thereon says .
"
There is a subtle differ-
ence in these words, here used almost interchangeably. Karma
arises from the past ; Dharma also so arises, but implies also the
law by which the next step in evolution is made." For the shloka
continues :
"
He who doeth the duty (Karma) laid down by his
own nature incurreth not sin
"

For there are great forces pouring down upon your world ;

pour down upon the world of men Well is it for you that your
karma has brought you to birth in these happy days ; well for you

intuition which is the voice of the Spirit speaks, so that you may
answer to the call of the Masters and find your way to Their Feet.
Annie Besant, The Mysteries
How then shall you apply this form of Yoga to these
splendid purposes ?
How shall the symbol of the Point help you to achieve
them?
The Point reveals to us the Eternal and Changeless
Presence of God, of the Good, from Age to Age, from
Eternity to Eternity, from Silence to Sound, from Sound to
Silence, from Darkness to Light, from Light to Darkness, and
beyond and beyond and beyond.
In fulfilling the Yoga of the Point we incarnate this
Mystery-Reality in ourselves, and in every detail of the Yoga
which we have chosen to perform.
The Point is the symbol of God the Everlasting,
Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnipresent Father-Mother.

As we reflect the Point in ourselves, we raise ourselves
to our eternal majesties, and perceive and exalt the majes-
ties in all
things. We bow in reverence before the Silence
and the Darkness, before the End of a Beginning and the
Beginning of an End, and we are uplifted into the Ceaseless
Breath of God.
The mighty Spirit of them all we remember in our-
selves and remember in all that is the subject of our Yoga.
And each must discover for himself how he shall fulfil
the Point in and for himself, and for his high purposes of
Yoga.
The Yoga of one is not the Yoga of another, so must
each of us learn to know for himself his Yoga of the Point.
Only general suggestions may be given, as have been
given above.
How shall the symbol of the Web that is the Womb
help you to reveal the splendid purposes of Yoga ?
The Web that is the Womb reveals to us God as the
Creator, in a universe, in a system, in a world, in every
living thing, of His Eternal and Changeless Presence. He
causes such Presence to be the Matrix of Life, the essence
of Life's fashioning.
In fulfilling the Yoga of the Web that is the Womb we
incarnate this Mystery- Reality in ourselves, and in every
detail of the Yoga which we have chosen to perform.
In ourselves we know that we are Gods-to-be, for in
ourselves we have sought and found the Promise, the Web
that is the Womb instinct with the Presence of God.
In all around us we perceive no less this Promise, a
Web instinct with the very Presence of God, fashioned
in the very form and substance of God.
The Point declares that God Is. The Web that is the
Womb declares that God is with and in us.
We bow in reverence before the Matrix of Creation ^
before a Beginning containing within itself its End.

We remember in ourselves our matrix, and remember

And each must discover for himself how he shall fulfil
the Web-Womb in and for himself, and for his high
purposes of Yoga,
The Yoga of one is not the Yoga of another, so must
each of us learn to know for himself his Yoga of the Web
that is the Womb.
How shall the symbol of the Line help you to reveal
the splendid purposes of Yoga ?
The Line reveals to us God in His glorious limitation
as Man. He descends into the Himalayas of a Godhead
and causes these loftinesses to brood upon great valleys,
plains and hills of evolution. He descends into a heaven,
and builds an earth that Man may climb to Him in Heaven.
The Line reveals the Beginning, the Way and the
End, and discloses that all three are in every living thing.
As the Point is but a reflection of Point after Point
of waxing magnitude, as the Web-Womb is but a reflection
of Matrices of waxing glory, so is the Line but a veritable
point in a curve of unfathomable unfoldment.
Yet it is the Divine Measure for our evolution, and is
the living standard dwelling in all that grows. In all
upon
which we gaze, with whatever eyes, of the Law, of the
Life, of the Will, of the Mind, of the Emotions, of the very
physical body itself, we see, with our Yoga, the Line at a
moment of its fulfilment.
In fulfilling the Yoga of the Line, we incarnate this
Mystery-Reality in ourselves, and in every detail of the Yoga
which we have chosen to perform.
In ourselves we know that our Way is certain and true,
however much we may linger and wait in the attraction of
experience. We are the Way. It is in us to its end, and
within the Will of God lies'the moment for the achievement
of the goal.

How shall the symbol of the Circle-Globe help you to
reveal the splendid purposes of Yoga ?
The Circle, Globe as it is indeed, reveals to us God in
His gathering of Men to form His kingdom, and to
set about His chosen people the encirclement of His pro-
tecting Will.
And His kingdom is fashioned in the Divine Measure
of the Line.
Everywhere we see this kingdom. Naught is outside
it, and it is safe.
How true it is that the "
kingdom of God is within us,"
and within all that lives.
In fulfilling the Yoga of the Circle-Globe we incarnate
this Mystery- Reality in ourselves, and in every detail of the
Yoga which we have chosen to perform.
And each must discover for himself how he shall fulfil
the Circle-Globe in and for himself, and for his high
purposes of Yoga.
The Yoga of one is not the Yoga of another, so must-
each of us learn to know for himself his Yoga of the Circle-
Globe.
How shall the symbol of the Cross help you to reveal
the splendid purposes of Yoga ?
The Cross, formed by the bisection of the vertical
Line of Measure and of resultant Life by the horizontal
Line, Line of Manifestation, reveals to us God at work in
His universe. God is ever at work. But the Cross is the
Cross of His descent and of Man's ascent. In the middle
of the Cross God and Man meet, for there is the Point of
Eternal Being.

This symbol of the Cross is for us almost indistinguish-

the Revolving Cross, Spirit as Matter and Matter as Spirit
churning to Divinity within God as limitation.
In fulfilling the Yoga of the Cross-Svastika we incarnate
this Mystery-Reality in ourselves, and in every detail of the
Yoga which we have chosen to perform.
In all life we perceive the Cross and its movement,
and we know that, thus moving, Life wends its appointed
way to the End.
And each must discover for himself how he shall fulfil
the Cross-Svastika in and for himself, and for his high
purposes of Yoga.
The Yoga of one is not the Yoga of another, so must
each of us learn to know for himself his Yoga of the
Cross-Svastika.
So do we come to the symbol of all symbols, the
Alpha and Omega of symbols, the symbol that was in the
beginning, is now, and ever shall be. In the beginning
was the thousand-petalled Lotus. The Lotus was God.
And God breathed upon the surface of the waters of the
unmanifest, and behold ! a myriad Lotuses rose from the
waters to begin their pilgrimage of high Self-consciousness.
The Lotus of Eternal Being. The Lotus of Eternal
Promise. The Lotus of Eternal Fulfilment. The Seed with
the Flower within. The Bud with the Flower within. The
Flower with the Seed within.
The Lotus meeting-point of heaven and earth, the
light of the sun descending upon the ascending dust of
the earth, and as by a miracle conjuring a flower therefrom.
The Lotus with its thousand petals of perfect white-
ness singing the Song of Man with the Voice of God,
weaving the form of Man in flashing colours, containing
within itself Man in his ^beginning and Man in his end
as God.

Each symbol we have seen is but a shadow of the
Lotus cast upon an awakening Sea of Life.
In fulfilling the Yoga of the Lotus we incarnate this
Mystery-Reality in ourselves, and in every detail of the Yoga
which we have chosen to perform.
In ourselves we know that in us dwells the Lotus life,
the Lotus soul, and that perchance the very Lotus form
is ours.
Indeed may it be that just as the whole universe is a
single Lotus, and each world a petal in Lotus form, so is
each of us a Lotus petal of a nobler Lotus, an earthly
fragment of a heavenly form.
But for each of us is this discovery. Each one of us
must discover for himself how he shall fulfil the Lotus in
and for himself, and for his high purposes of Yoga.
Jhe Yoga of one is not the Yoga of another, so must
each of us learn to know for himself his Yoga of the Lotus.

THAT: THE SYMBOL-LESS
The Darkness encompasseth us.
Ignorance enfoldeth us with her dark wings, lest the Light
return us to Himself in the power of His ruthless Universality.
We see not We know not We gaze We think. We feel
We move outwards and outwards.
We dwell in our narrow resting-places. We hope. We
recoil We seek. A sense of certainty sustaineth us
And all the while compassionate Ignorance enfoideth and
cherisheth us with her dark wings, lest the Light return us to
Himself in the power of His ruthless Universality.
The Darkness encompasseth us and is our salvation, for the
Light knoweth no distinction of growth. He shineth alike upon
all that lives. But the Darkness tempereth His blazing Radiance
to each unfolding ray of His Glory.
Let us not therefore rebel against Ignorance, nor denounce
the Darkness.
Rather shall we fulfil our Ignorance in reverence for her
veiling, fulfilling the Less even in its partial reflection of the More.
So also shall we fulfil the Darkness in reverence, for is he
not the child of Light and His Messenger ?
The Point The whole conception of the Point reminds me of
poised between irr rtN
Eternities that phrase in the first Stanza of Dzyan,
"
the Visible
that was, and the Invisible that is." The Visible that was
the evolutionary process which has brought forth into con-
summation a God. The Invisible that is the poise of God
between eternities, between the eternity of an age that
was and the eternity of an age that is to be. I had almost
wished that the stanza had included the words,
" and the

Invisible that is to be." Then indeed would the Point have
been perfectly described.
The Point encloses within its awesomeness a beginning,
wrapped in a mystery of No-Beginning, and an end in a
mystery of No-End. Let us contemplate the Point and be-
come surrounded with an atmosphere within which dwells
No-Atmosphere.
How true it is that the comprehensibility of what we
are pleased for some reason or other to call Being inti-
mately depends upon an immediate reference to No-
Being. Being is
incomplete without No-Being, Light with-
out Darkness, Sound without Silence, Day without Night,
Right without Wrong, Man without Woman, Beginning with-
out End, Centre without Circumference, Everywhere with-
out Nowhere, Life without Death.
The Point symbol may be regarded as an aspect of
that solid centre which forms the nucleus of a solar system,
electric as we know electricity, but electric in modes of
electricity on higher planes of which we have no conception,
whatever. I cannot help thinking of this nucleus being
somewhat in the nature of a block of ice, of electric ice, if
I
may use the expression ; not in any sense cold, save as
in an intensity which seems to unite heat and cold in one.
But this block of nucleus electricity is in a condition of
inconceivable movement, so inconceivable that we char-
acterize it as movementless, and associate with it
poise, and
the Silence and Darkness of that No-Sound and No-Light
which is More-than-Sound and More-than-Light.
I
might almost describe the Point as a vortex, a vor-
tex which at once stirs its constituent elements into the Web
that is the Womb, and sends forth from such Web the
Line which is the Divine Measure of the evolution-to-be.
For the purpose of concentrating attention on the essen-
tials for the Yoga with which I am concerned, I have, of
course, avoided reference to the exceedingly complicated

considerations involved in the establishment of an evo-
lutionary process of the nebulae, of the rings, of the
physical and non-physical planets, of the Sun, of the Chains,
of the System, and so forth.
But viewed from a certain angle, ! think I have not
made any misstatement in the way in which I have tried to
show the emergence of Man.
And I am now going to test the student's stability,
such as he may have achieved, in these various symbols
which I am in process of revealing to him, by inviting
his attention to the immense importance in the right
understanding of symbol to conceive, pan passu, No-
Symbol.
The conception of No-Symbol is our safety-valve, for
without it there is
danger lest we become slaves to sym-
bols instead of using them as means to an end.
Every symbol I have been tracing is but a form of the
formless, and if we know forms it is that we may know
No-Form even more. But I think that most people, though
by no means all, need the stepping-stone of forms in order
to attain the heights of the formless.
Therefore, intent though I should wish the student to
be upon these or upon any other symbols which may to him
express the Real, I ask him from time to time to adjust
his world of symbols to that universe of No-Symbol of
which it is a shadow, in which it is as a planet to a
central Sun.
Marvellous, unfathomable, as the Point indeed is, and
is
every other of these symbols of the Real, it and they are
but tiny bubbles on the Sea of Boundlessness.
From time to time let us shatter our symbols, or per-
haps I had better say, penetrate within them, and stand
symbol-less in the very Presence of THAT l
which cannot be
described in any words, in any language, in any forms.

A Flash of
Standing
I wish that we should stand in the Presence of
THAT which is not even Silence or Darkness, Being or No-
Being. Will any experience befall us ? Will any change take
place in us ? Can we even stand symbol-less, transcend-
ing all attributes with which we seek to gain some glimmer-
ing of understanding of the Incomprehensible ?
I
say that in each of us, God and more than God as
each of us ultimately is, there is in us the very THAT which is
beyond all
symbols, beyond all attributes, beyond all
Being
and No-Being, beyond all in us born of the Creative
Spirit.
I
say that such THAT registers it is the only word I
can think of, that I dare use an inexplicable Yoga, in which
the Yogi, fades away, and Yoga alone remains.
Dare I
say that the THAT which is nameless, because it
is all names and no names, is Itself changed because we
stand silently, without form or sound, beyond the uttermost
regions of our selves, because we just stand, neither reach-
ing out, nor invoking, nor acting in any state of conscious-
ness, because we stand and lose even the posture of our
standing, though I have used this word in no sense as
suggestive of actual standing ?
Yes. Thus do we assert our ultimate heritage, from
which we are now infinitely far away.
Some day we must so stand, for the THAT in us
must come into Its own. Some day we shall so stand
for ever.
Today we may so stand, for the THAT in us makes
possible tha impossible, if I
may use this apparent contra-
diction. It is not as untrue as it
may seem.
But it can only be a flash of so standing, even though
it may seem to last an eternity.
And we must stand and then cease to stand, and
turn not our thoughts, nor feelings, nor emotions, nor
speech, nor even our will, upon our standing.
514 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
We stand and

Standing
We stand in our
Godhead
The Naught of
No-Being
We stand and forget our standing. For our Yoga it
is
perhaps the highest of all
Yogas of all forms will be of
no avail, indeed will do us injury, if we seek to measure
with even a single thought that which is
beyond all
thought,
if we seek to measure with even a single feeling or emo-
tion that which is
beyond all
feeling and emotion, if we
seek to measure with even a single word that which is
beyond all words, if we seek to measure even with our
will that which is
beyond all will.
Only as we stand in the Silence and Darkness of our
Soul and cease to stand, breathing no word of it, thinking
no thought of it, feeling no movement from it, having
no will from it, shall we become strengthened in our
Godhead.
In such a region of unutterable attributelessness there
is the Naught which is No-Number, No-Silence, No-Dark-
ness, No-Being.
Let us stand in it if we can. But let it be as Naught
when we emerge from it.
And as I
say these things, I
myself stand aghast at my
temerity.
Yet, for the sake of helpfulness, I
may knock on
the Ring-Pass-Not which ever surrounds such impene-
trabilities.
THAT
I find myself using the word JHA J when in fact it is
one of the least suitable of words to use, for it
definitely conveys
the idea of a something external to oneself, when in
reality the
word to be used should be all-comprehensive, involving affirmation,
negation, and the relation between them, whatever this relation
may be. Perhaps I had better take refuge in the Samskrit TAT
the knowable rootless Root. The vaguer the actual concep-
tion in the minds of my readers the more is the conception true.
Indeed I make no apology for any vagueness in rny observations
THAT: THE SYMBOL-LESS 515
which leaves a reader intriguingly confused, for. as I have already
said, the Yoga of one individual cannot be the Yoga of another,
though a Yogi and I
certainly cannot claim the appellation -if he
has real Yoga, his very own, can knock with it
upon the con-
sciousness-door of another and call the Yoga within to awake, to
arise, and to attend.

Blake
In this form of Yoga, as, of course, in all other forms,
there occur those inbreathings and outbreathings which indi-
cate a swaying between the centre and the circumference.
At times I find myself so close to the centre that the
whole of myself and no less the whole of my surroundings
become integral parts of the symbols of each separately,
of all together, as all really are in that Eternal wherein past,
present and future have only essential meaning. The whole
of my being, from the highest of my conscious conscious-
nesses outwards, is
symbol, and there is no one and another.
Hence, no less is symbol all that is external to me, if there
be anything external in point of truth so far as this closeness
to the centre is concerned.
At other times I find myself away out into the regions
of remote circumferences, and the symbol-idea grows dim
YOGA WITHOUT END 517
and almost unreal. But even when I find myself in this
outer court, Memory survives and waits to become the
bridge which shall draw centre and circumference into
oneness.
The aeroplane, the wireless, the electric telegraph,
television all are bridging the gulf between the Eternal
and Time, between the Centre and the Circumference.
Some day we shall transcend all space limitations not only
within our world, but also between our world and other
worlds. The universe is one, and its unity waits to be
realized.
lte<l
M "
So is !t with Symbolic Y 9a - The symbol is the key
to the Oneness of Life. It is the formula of that Oneness.
And each symbol is a constituent element in the formula.
The symbol does not merely express Universal Brotherhood.
It
goes beyond Brotherhood into Unity, and establishes
Unity as the essence of Life.
When I am as it were centrifugalized, then is disclosed
to me this Oneness.
I shall watch everything around me break up I can
think of no more appropriate expression into its consti-
tuent individualities, but I shall also gain a glimpse of the
nature of the Sea of the Unmanifest as a picture appears
of that which is before the disintegration takes place.
There is a oneness in all around me. It is a one
without a second. There are walls. These are onenesses.
There is a carpet. This is a oneness. There are chairs. These
are onenesses. There is the pianoforte. This is a oneness.
There are the pictures, the various objects in the room.
There is the room. All are onenesses, and all the one-
nesses form together a " one," And I see them as
" un-
manifest
"
I mean unmanifest from the point of view of a
certain condition of consciousness. They become resolved
back into their unmanifestness. Unmanifestness is as much
their quality as manifestness. All are unmanifest-manifest,
518 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
and I can see them as one or the other. But it is too
difficult to see them as both simultaneously, and even
to see one or the other is but to use these two terms
relatively. Black is
only black relatively. Similarly, the un-
manifest is
only unmanifest relatively. And the manifest is
only manifest relatively. The Sea of the Unmanifest ! Just
five words of indeterminate meaning. The word " Sea
"
is
only a relative term. The word "
Unmanifest
"
is
only a
relative term. All are words to give an illusory haze to a
certain condition of consciousness which we cannot contact
unless it has some substance, outline, perceptible to our
blindness. We must pretend we can say something about it.
The Many This Unmanifest round about me is not unmanifest save
afire with
Symbols as I
gaze upon it in the terms of the Unmanifest. The
moment I enter into a condition of centrifugalization, the
scene qhanges as in a flash, and from unmanifestation I
am plunged into a vision of manifestation. Out of unity
appears diversity. Out of the one appear the many. Out
of universality appears individuality. As I have said, every-
thing breaks up while remaining within the unity. The wall
is a conglomeration of individualities veritably afire with
symbols, incarnating symbols. The carpet is a conglo-
meration of individualities veritably afire with symbols, in-
carnating them. And so with everything in the room.
There is an aliveness which might be terrifying and blinding
but for the fact that there seems to be no, I must say,
there is
nothing less than a Yoga of Symbols, a Yoga in
Symbols, marvellously, miraculously, incredibly, stupendous-
ly at work, at play, unfolding, growing, evolving.

Y 9a everywhere around me. Yoga fills the universe.
Yoga is the universe. Yoga is oneness. Yoga is individ-
uality. Yoga is Life. And here am I
telling the world of
my ascent into Yoga, of the revelation of Yoga to me by a
Teacher ! And I seem to suggest that there must be prep-
aration for Yoga, that Yoga is not for everybody, that it is
YOGA WITHOUT END 519
Every Atom is a
Yog.
Object-Yogis
The Vision of
the Centre
a science which must be studied, practised, and for which
there must be purificatory preparation !
How true this is from one point of view, but otherwise,
how very false. I am a Yogi. I have ever been a Yogi.
In the beginning was Yoga. To life without end there will
be Yoga. And every single element in life, every single
atom in every kingdom of nature, is a Yogi at a certain
stage of unfoldment of Yoga.
My room becomes alive with Yoga as the centrifugal-
ization functions. My room becomes alive with Yogis, with
individuals no less individual in essence than myself, some
more individual than others, some less, just as I
myself am
more individual than some, and less than others.
What a comradeship of Yogis- -my room and I. How
the symbols which constitute me and the symbols which
constitute the individuals of the room blend into one, are
one, emphasize the oneness in our very diversity.
And then I
long to commune with these Yogis these
wall-Yogis, if I
may so term these entities, these carpet-
Yogis, these piano-Yogis, these object-Yogis. I know I am
expressing myself in what will be thought by some to be a
most ridiculous absurdity. But the absurdity dwells only
when centre and circumference are very far away, and
when our abode is in the far-off regions of the circum-
ference.
In one of the Hindu Scriptures a number of blind men
try to describe an elephant by touching him one at one
place, others at other places. One says he is a snake.
Another says he is a drum. A third maintains he is a broom.
A fourth insists that he is a thick column. And so on. But
the man of vision tells them it is an elephant, and shows
how the animal uses as a living creature each of the objects
described.
So do I see a wall, four walls, a carpet, a piano, a
number of objects.
But when the vision of the centre
520 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
comes to me, I see Yogis. I cannot hold the vision for
long, for I am not yet a God of the Centre. I am still a
Man of the Circumference. I have not yet conquered the
Circumference, so as to be able to take it back with me as
I travel homewards to the Centre where the Circumference
most truly dwells.
In each constituent individuality the Point reigns in all
supremacy. But each is a product of the Web that is the
Womb. Each is a Line. Each, within a Circle, has in him
the Circle-spirit. Each is a soldier of the Cross, of that
Cross which is the Father- Mother of all Crosses as we see
them used in the faiths of the world. Each is a whirling
Svastika. In each a Lotus Seed is
warming into unfoldment.
Then the Lotus Fire. And the Point which goes forth
returns home.
A Comradeship I wish I could describe all that a room looks like
of "Men"
when it has transcended its mere room-ness, when it is
a room because its constituent elements need " room
"
for their growth, but when it is more than a crowd,
is a comradeship of " Men
"
within, enfolded by, a
Heavenly Man.
I know full well that innumerable " incontrovertible
"
arguments may be advanced to demonstrate the gross falsity
of all I have just written. I know it
may well be described
as the phantasmagoria of an utterly diseased and uncon-
trolled imagination. I know I cannot argue its
probability.
I know I am helpless before common sense, because I have
only uncommon sense to 'offer. I know many must put
down my book as not only unscientific but as anti-scientific,
even though Eddington tells us that theories matter as
much as observations, and that even our most authenticat-
ed "facts" are nothing more than inferences. For my
own part, in all
humility I venture to believe that I am
highly scientific, though perhaps in the realms of another
science. At least I have observed to the best of my
YOGA WITHOUT END 521
power, and I cannot help it if there be none to support
me in the outer world.
My Symbol- | see Yogis round about me when my eyes, be they
inner or outer, are open to
"
see." Once the Symbol-
motif stirs in me to quicken my Reality, I am a Yogi
manifest in a series of symbols, and around me are my
kind, my very flesh and blood, my very symbol-mates.
How far I have to travel until I know these symbol-mates
for whom they are. I look here. I look there. I see a
Yogi of the mineral kingdom. I see a Yogi of the veget-
able kingdom. I see a Yogi of the animal kingdom. I
see a human Yogi. I see a Yogi who has transcended all
human limitations. And even can I see far beyond into
realms of Yoga where dwell Yogis Divine in their Yoga.
But of what nature is each of these ? What is the different
Way of each ? What is that oneness within which these
manynesses live and move and have their evolutionary
being ?
The And then it is as if I were trying to venture out of
Secret bounds there are bounds beyond which an individuality
seeks to pass at his peril, there are bounds beyond which
he cannot pass. There are Rings-Pass-Not hedging in for
his safety each and every individuality. And here am I
seeking to follow the Point in His upward way, seeking to
follow the Line in its infinitudes, seeking to know the Circle
in its relation to the Sea of the Unmanifest, seeking to
know who are the Men of the Sea, seeking to know the
form, the sound, the colour of the Call, seeking to know
the Cross, and the Way of the Svastika, and the Secret of
the Lotus !
But do I not seek to know more ? Do I not seek to
know something of evolutions which are different from the
evolution to which I and my fellow-Men of the Sea belong ?
I want to transcend all limitations. I want to over-
come all barriers, I want to be free to ascend the
522 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
ultimate heights and depths. I want to be able to travel
into the infinitudes of distances. I want to know and
to BE!
Leash after What presumption, you say. Yes, but God created
Leash gives way
man to be immortal and made him an image of his own
Divinity. He, God, looked upon me and knew that I am
also God. So did He create me to be my immortal Self.
So did He make me to be an image of my Divinity.
Therefore do I strain at leash after leash until leash after
leash gives way. Therefore do I ever strain until I become
divinely free, and there is
naught which I
may not, which I
shall not, become, for I am immortal, I am God, I am all
that is Eternal and Infinite. Presumption ? No ! I am but
treading the Way of the Self.

THE SYMBOLS AS BULWARKS AGAINST
BARBARISM
The greatest
Service
The Call of the
Yogi to a New
World
The guardian wall, or the wall of protection : It is
taught that
the accumulated efforts of long generations of Yogis . . . have
created, so to say, a wall of protection around mankind, which
wall shields mankind invisibly from still worse evils
Tfie Voice of the Silence
No greater service could any man or woman or youth
of goodwill render to the world in its present dire straits
than to form part of the bulwark against barbarism which
the Elders of our race are raising everywhere a universal
Siegfried or Maginot Line, to be a defence of the world
against barbarism in whatever forms it
may be displaying
itself. I think it is worthwhile to note that the great
symbols of this form of Yoga are in very truth part of
this bulwark, visible to those who have the Yoga eyes
to see.
And each symbol is not only part of this universal
world-wide and world-permeating bulwark, but it is also in
very truth an Oriflamme which the Yogi may carry before
him as he seeks to place his Yoga at the service of a
distracted world.
It is to a new world that the Yogi must call in the
spirit of each of these symbols separately, and all of them
together as a mighty Unity. It must be very clearly under-
stood that the service of the world demands that these
great, though only relative, Ultimates must be brought into
524 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
increasingly close proximity to the conditions obtaining at
any particular time. The symbols are for use as well as for
contemplation. They are to be foci for Power and Wisdom
and Glory, no less than symbols of fundamental Realities.
I can see the Yogis who belong to this particular
A'Burning-Glass form of Yoga using each symbol as a kind of burning-glass
into which the mighty forces of the Real converge that
they may issue forth as means wherewith to burn away all
weeds of wrong so that the flowers of right may have
freedom in which to grow.
I hear the Yogis of this form of Yoga sending forth
their Call through symbol after symbol :
/ call the New World in the Conceiving of
the Point, and the New World hears the
Call and awakens.
I establish the Cradle of the New World in
the spirit of the Web that is the Womb.
I invoke the Line which measures the splen-
dours of the New World.
I endow the New World with its mighty Indi-
viduality in the magic of the Circle.
I
impress upon the New World the Sign-
Manual of its Purpose, the Holy Cross.
I send forth the New World on its Svastika
Way.
I lead the New World to its Flowerdom in
Lotus Fire.
And its flowering gives to Life a new per-
fume, a new melody, a new colour, a new
form.
Another Point is born into Divine Self-Con-
sciousness,
THE SYMBOLS AS BULWARKS AGAINST BARBARISM 525
The Spirit of | n varying ways do I hear this magic being performed,
Birth
and I see how the whole spirit of the great evolutionary
process is a spirit of Birth, of an Awakening, of an ap-
parently not-ending series of expansions of consciousness.
The Point is bom of the Lotus Fire.
The Web is born of the Point.
The Line is born of the Web.
The Circle is born of the Line.
The Cross is born of the Circle.
The Svastika is born of the Cross.
The Lotus Fire is born of the Svastika,
Each gives birth as it receives birth.
Each is an Awakening within the Circle of
Fulfilment.
Each is the Less of a Transcendent More.
The Whole is the Less of a Transcendent More.
The Call to But not only do I hear the Call of the Yogi who
belongs to this particular form of Yoga in the terms in
which I have described it, but I hear a Call which seems
almost more incisive, more compelling, more direct, more,
perhaps, directed to the awakening of the world's funda-
mental needs in such times as these :
/ call the world to Remembrance of its
Divinity.
I call the world to Remembrance of its Divine
Motherhood.
I call the world to Remembrance of its Divine
Stature.
I call the world to Remembrance of its Divine
Brotherhood.
I call the world to Remembrance of its Divine
Purpose.
I call the world to Remembrance of its Divine
Way.
I call the world to Remembrance of its Divine
Glory.

FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
Each of these seems to be a vibrant mantra which,
as it were, thrills the world into synchronization with its
sound, colour, form, pattern. Indeed, I feel that anyone
to whom this form of Yoga is
utterly congenial could use
these sentences as a daily invocation to the world for Self
Remembrance. There may be either an utterance of them
all
together, or each may be used, sent forth, as occasion
and place may seem to demand.
Finally, if we desire to know very specifically what
quality each symbol brings to the service of the Universal
Bulwark against barbarism, I
might suggest the following :
The Conceiving of the Point.
The Motherhood of the Web.
The Divine Measure of the Line.
The Safety of the Circle.
The Witness of the Cross.
The Way of the Svastika.
The Victory of the Lotus.
The Silence of the Point.
Thus with all the Power and Wisdom and Glory which
an understanding of these symbols can put into them, each
can be used as an individual bulwark against the barbarism
of ignorance, of cruelty, of dishonour ; or all may be used
as one ; or the Soldier-Yogi may fuse himself into the
bulwarks against barbarism and use a great Wall 1
to
save the world without necessarily any particular reference
to the symbols.

We talk so much about freedom in these days, so
much about the urgent need for breaking all chains of
enslavements, about being free to be, to think, to feel, to
speak, to do, and yet so often, when we free ourselves
from one enslavement, or think we are so freeing our-
selves, in fact we are but exchanging one enslavement for
another, one tyranny for another, one authority for another.
Becoming different, we allow ourselves to be caught in an
illusion of freedom, for we cast off old shackles, or think
we do, and do not yet perceive that new shackles are
gathering round about us.
We do not yet realize that we must give our lives
their own meanings and their own values, and that we must
discover these within, asleep as many of them may be,
though the awakening may be facilitated through the in-
tense living of an individuality outside us.
I have no doubt whatever that there is a Life outside
which we cannot nor do we live. We are inherent in that
Life. We are expressions of it. We cannot express that
which is outside this Life, for the simple reason that it
would be unnatural for us so to do, beyond our own nature

A single Petal

Theosophy

Mystery Flower :

Wisdom

Lotus

Wisdom
itself. But within that Life we can express its infinite Rain-
bow of Sound, of Colour, of Form, and each one of us is
magnificently unique, a one without a second of identical
expression.
I
verily believe that there is a Universal Theosophy, an
ultimate Science of the Divine Wisdom, outside which there
is no religion, nor philosophy, nor science. But I
verily
believe no less that even the magnificent aspect of that
Theosophy which Theosophists of the modern world call
Theosophy, and which finds description in what I call
"
classic Theosophical literature," is but one single petal of
the vast Lotus of Theosophy which is the whole of the
Goodness of the Majesty of God.
A Petal has been disclosed to us. We see how
glorious it is, how perfect it is, and in it we perceive, by
Divine Grace, the very whole of the Mystery Flower of
which it is a shooting flame. Verily does it contain within
itself the essence of the Lotus, the fragrance of the Lotus,
the form of the Lotus within it is the life of the Lotus.
And to us, so rightly, it is the Lotus Flower of the Divine
Wisdom of God.
And yet it is but a petal. And the Lotus of God, of
Eternal Life, is
myriad-petalled. Our very universe itself is
but a petal of a Cosmic Lotus, enfolding a solar system,
and the solar system itself is but a petal. . . .
We have had revealed to us a fragment of the
Divine Wisdom, a form of it, an aspect of it. Within that
very fragment are truths other than those with which we
are comparatively familiar.
With what are we concerned ? Is the revelation enough
for us ? Is it for us alone ? Is it
perchance for the whole
world ? Is it a perfect, an ultimate, revelation ?
We may well be deeply grateful for the revelation, as
for any other revelation coming from any heights, be these
the heights of a man or of a God.
THE ENDLESS GLORY 529
The Vision calls

Heights

But however splendid these heights may be seen to
be, be they the heights of a faith, of a philosophy, of a
science, of a person, the vision of their glory is but to cry
out to us that there are heights after heights within our-
selves which we must climb, which we must challenge, which
we must conquer.
"Seek ye the heights within you," declare these
heights without.
" Know yourselves to be plains, and
valleys, and hills, and mountains, and ranges of mountains,
of summits supreme, yea, even hells which lift
you up intb
your heavens . . . Know yourselves to be Moons and Suns
and Stars, and all that is more even than these . . ."
Yet, to whatever splendours you climb, there remain glories
beyond ; and while you may revel in rest, you will
rejoice
still more to climb. Thus tells you the Divine Wisdom,
the Theosophy of all Theosophies, the Truth within all truths
and within all so-called falsehoods too.
Not a single word is uttered in Theosophy for which
your acceptance is desired, far less demanded. Not a
single idea is placed upon an altar that you may worship it
Nowhere are you asked so to spread Theosophy that others
shall incline before it. Nowhere is there one single doc-
trine or dogma or form of orthodoxy in any true presenta-
tion of Theosophy.
You are not asked to believe, nor are you asked to
accept. It is
hoped you will study. And it is
eagerly
wished that through such study you shall come to beauti-
ful, inspiring, tremendous conclusions about yourself, con-
clusions which ardently satisfy you from the point of
view of the widest possible vision of your Eternal Self,
yet which stir in you nothing less than a divine dis-
content with yourself as you are, and a laughing, happy,,
resistless determination to achieve that More of which,
with the aid of a Theosophy, you have caught a stirring
glimpse.

You yourself are a Theosophy. You are a world.
You are a God. You are a Truth. The kingdom of your-
self is round about you. It is yours. And all that any
individual can do, any religion, any philosophy, any science,
is to call your attention to your own essential kingship, to
say to you :
" You can," and to speed you on your way of
self-discovery.
For what purpose was The Secret Doctrine written,
that Book of all books ? To set before you descriptions
which you must take as facts, at least believe, and make
into a pack of cards with which to play a game of life,
using them as a beginner might play the game of bridge,
having carefully learned the rules ; or perhaps observing
them as an animal might perform tricks taught him by his
trainer, having no knowledge of their real meaning ?
The Secret Doctrine was given by Those who knew
its statements to be true, but who did not want you to
believe them to be true, but to find out for yourself
whether they are true or not, and perchance even to make
of some of the statements use other than that to which
they were put in the book itself.
Build your own lives with your own bricks and accord-
ing to your own plans. Theosophy may tell you that such
and such is the standard Plan, and that here and there
are the best bricks to use. Maybe you yourself will in due
course find that that Plan is indeed true, and that there
is no other Plan. Maybe you yourself will in due course
find that Theosophy knows where the best bricks are.
You want the best bricks and the best Plan. Theosophy
has them.
But maybe also that the Plan, as at present set forth
in Theosophy, is not complete, could not be complete,
because it can be understood by us only in its incomplete-
ness. Maybe, too, there are other bricks as well as those
recommended. Personally, I believe that this is so. And
THE ENDLESS GLORY 53 1

I still more believe that there can be no Plan for any one
of us which is not a Plan that he fashions out of his own
living, and that there can be no bricks for any one of us
that are not bricks of our own personal making.
Each one of us may look at the Plan revealed
to us, and say how glorious it is. Each one of us may
examine the bricks and delight in their obvious perfec-
tion. We may say that we know the Plan to be really
ours, the bricks to be such as we wish that we ourselves
could fashion.
But if there be divine elan in us, a deep and unquench-
able longing to be architects and builders of our own
Houses of Being, then we shall look to see if we cannot
make a glorious Plan of ourselves, and fashion bricks worthy
to be its material substance.
And we shall seek everywhere for that which shall
help us to plan, to make and to build. We shall seek in
religions, in philosophies, in all the sciences and the arts, in
all modes of living, among all races and nations.
We shall seek among those who claim that they have
discovered their own plans and their own bricks, among
those who declare that they have yet to find, among those
who will tell us there is
nothing to find, and among those
who are so eager to find but cannot.
Everywhere we shall seek, not to use in blindness,
neither in authority, but that we may add to our selves from
other selves, and add to other selves from our selves, when-
ever there is happy occasion so to do.
" In My Father's House are many mansions

innumerable mansions built by hands in every kingdom of
nature, mansions which each son of God in every kingdom
of nature is fashioning, building, brick by brick, from the
material of every kingdom of nature, and according to the
Plan of Himself as Man with which He journeyed forth from
Heaven on His way to His own individual Godhead.

And I am sure that each mansion has its own differ-
ent individuality with which it
helps to form the Heaven-
ly City.
But I am not for a moment saying that we may not
up to a certain point experiment with the plans and build-
ing material of others, especially of one whom we recognize
as farther on the evolutionary pathway. I think we may
do much building with the aid of the plans and the bricks
of others. But sooner or later the time must come when
we shall in some measure at least refashion our structure to
suit those vital needs of ours which we have at last discovered.
Until we know ourselves we shall need the help of those
who have discovered themselves. When we have dis-
covered ourselves, we shall fashion a
"
mansion
"
in the
splendour of that uniqueness with which at last we have
come face to face, but even then we shall be grateful for
help, which, far from dictating to us, far from imposing
authority upon us, far from making invidious comparisons
between one form of the Science of Life and another, will
be but as a surrounding light, lighting us on our way, and
not deflecting our steps to another.
I
yield to none in my reverence for those whom I have
found to be wiser than myself and how many there are
and in some small way I think I have the spirit of a soldier,
eager to receive and to obey all directions from such wiser
friends as these, concerning service beyond my power to
understand. I do indeed believe that the authority of the
wise is so often the very salvation of the ignorant. I know
that life is a veritable battlefield, I
hope a Kurukshetra, and
I am proud and happy to recognize my Generals and to
serve under Them, as I
hope I should a physical-plane
superior in a righteous war.
On the other hand, I find naught of this incompatible
with my freedom, and as I work year after year in The
Theosophical Society and for Theosophy. I find my freedom

becoming stronger and my individuality richer, even though
more than ever I am
Waiting the word of the Master,
Watching the Hidden Light ;
Listening to catch His orders
In the very midst of the fight.
But I find also that the occasions are rare indeed for
the hearing of the Word of the Master, and rarer still for
the receiving of what is called an "
order."
The Masters know far better than ourselves how vital
is
self-dependence, how essential is the spirit of self-reli-
ance, how imperative it is that we should seek for ourselves
and make our own discoveries of Life's worthwhileness.
They know so well how each one of us must know his
own Truth. There may be occasions for constant guidance,
as in the case of our Society in its
infancy and very early
youth. Such guidance They gave most richly. Even now
They watch over a Movement which is above all else Theirs.
But we have over sixty years of acquaintance with Theos-
ophy, and with a Society which is
splendidly virile. To those
of my readers who have the inestimable privilege of mem-
bership of The Theosophical Society, I would say : Let
the real Founders see what we can do with Theosophy and
with Their Society standing on our own feet, engaging in
our own quests, discovering our own truths, enriching the
world with our own wealth, not alone with Theirs.

Rupert Brooke
Throughout this book of Endless Groping, I see that
I have failed to give that which should be its essence and
the heart of all descriptions. I see that I have failed to
disclose the Symbol of all
symbols, of that Life without
which there would be no symbols at all. I have indeed
written of Life in innumerable of its qualities, of its
quality
as the Sea of the Unmanifest-Manifest, of its quality as
Individuality and Universality, of its quality of Space, of
Time, and of other dimensions. I have written of Life in
its
aspect of the "
Men of the Sea." And I have striven
to depict the resultant symbol-formulae of an evolutionary
process which is also Life.
But in so doing have I
actually described Life as Life
is? Have I
anywhere hinted even at the very symbol of
Life itself?
Must I confess that while I
may know a little about the
qualities of Life, I do not in fact know what Life is, that I
have but a vague idea of some of its processes? I think I must
make this confession. The part cannot know the Whole, and
an infinitesimal part, as in my case, can have but an idea
of Life as fashioned in its own microscopic image. Such a
limited conception is all that even the deepest science, re-
ligion, philosophy, art can have ;
though, from one point of
view, heights of knowledge may be reached which no indi-
vidual can attain, especially where the truly Great have been
at work in revealing Life through science, religion, phil-
osophy and art.
On the other hand, the individual can in his own mys-
terious way approach Life directly as neither science, nor
religion, nor philosophy, nor art can do. He /$ Life, and if
536 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
in some strange way he discovers a means to intensify Life
in himself, so that he becomes Life-fui or should I
say,
more Life-conscious then such intensified Life- Being may
cause him to know a little more of the nature of Life, at least
as expressed in his own particular rate of vibrations. He
can at least know something of Life at first-hand. Through
all these other modes of approach, he can at best know
Life at second-hand. But as I seek thus to intensify Life in
myself, I find myself slipping away from Life in terms of
Individuality into Life in terms of Universality, so that while
to a certain extent I can become Life, I find myself less and
less able to describe Life. Only through an endeavour
to swing a pendulum between Life as Individuality and Life
as Universality, can I, at the point where the pendulum is at
Individuality, hasten to try to describe what it
brings with it
from Universality before it
swings thereto again. The pro-
cess is, therefore, not a little breathless, and unless I can very
carefully steady my various vehicles, not only shall I do myself
more harm than good but I shall also be in no condition to
transmit the impressions produced by the swing of the
pendulum at its
Individuality pole.
Self-empty | find I must at first void myself of such expressions
of myself which in any way tend to limit the expressions
of Life as Life is. I must subtract from myself all growth-
emphasis, all
becoming-emphasis, all
emphasis on past,
present and future, even of all individuality-emphasis so
far as this is at all possible. I must learn to slip into the Sea
of Universality without, however, closing my way back to
the river of my individuality. I must be able to pass to
and fro between the two. But I must be very careful
not to allow the river to dominate the sea, so that I look
upon the sea as but a glorified river.

think that I can hold on to the river while exploring the
sea, and what is far more important, I think that I can
THE LIFE MAGNIFICENT 537
spasmodically give the river a sea effect, that is to say, I can
flood my individuality with Universality, at least at rare
intervals. I see at once that the river is constituted in no
way differently from the sea, that Universality and Indi-
viduality are one and the same, the distinction being and
it is
essentially a distinction without a difference that the
river is fresh water, while the sea seems to be salt water,
though in fact in essence the sea is water both salt and
fresh, while the river is
only fresh. The idea of the Salt
l
of Life comes to me. There is a saltness about Life which
I have to try to find and if
possible to describe. Universal-
ity is different from Individuality by virtue of some saltness
about it a saltness which Individuality possesses only
potentially, and which it has to achieve in order that it
may
enter into the Yoga of Universality without losing the Yoga
of Individuality. I am afraid this is not very clear, but I
have to leave it without any attempt at elucidation since it
depicts the nature of a mode of consciousness into which I
enter as I wend my way to Life.
A Concentration | am afraid I can only place upon this canvas of my
Movement description here and there just a splash of feeble colour. A
picture is
impossible. But here and there an impression
may possibly be conveyed. In the mode of consciousness
which I have been entering I find an Unendingness, with
No-Beginning and No-Ending, and in a sense with No-
Movement, for there is an entirely inexpressible and in-
comprehensible concentration of All-Movement into what
looks like a point of No-Movement. There is a complete
Unity-Diversity of Affirmation-Negation. I can find no other
sentence wherewith to describe this All-Noughtness, this
perfect identification of a Universal Yes and a Universal No.
It is evident that I have to use words ; but words, even
though aspects of life, are limitations of life ; and I am
trying to escape from as many limitations as I can. I am.

to catch it, thus finding myself giving the names of the net
to that which the net is intended to catch. Of course,
Life cannot be caught. There is
only the illusion of catch-
ing. Yet, without the illusion, there would seem, at our
level, to be no possibility of any understanding whatever.
The only names Life can have for us are the names where-
by we seek to imprison it.
A Mask of Life
Thus, as I strive to meet my pendulum as it
brings
gifts from Universality to Individuality, it becomes clear to
me that never can I
really describe Life as Life appears
through the net of its capture, through a great illusion
which nevertheless is real ! As I thus perceive Life, I am, of
course, perceiving what Life looks like through the Arundale
illusion. The Arundale personal equation ventures, with un-
doubted impertinence, to describe Life in terms of it* own
individual insignificance. But I
suppose that this is all any
can do who are still

? I do

"
I do not It is curious how much the phrase "I do not

"
is the constant motif of all
my endeavours to
seek out the nature of Life. As I
try to understand, even
if some understanding seems to come to me, still there
is the background of "I do not know." And I have
come to realize that this phrase is valuable as no other
phrase could possibly be. It is
only by being able at
all times to say "I do not know
"
that our knowledge is
likely to become more and more. Indeed, I am almost
inclined to be conceited enough to think that the fact I
hear this phrase so constantly is in some way testimony to
the fact that I am moving in the right direction and am
beginning to know a little more safely. For only as with
increasing knowledge we find more insistence on the " '
do not know," is the inadequacy and inaccuracy of the
THE LIFE MAGNIFICENT 539
knowledge clear to us, so that we become safe in humility
rather than in danger through pride.

because much of the air we breathe is
impregnated with
a tremendous confusion of vague or hard conceptions of a

"
as a matter of convenience,
as a convention. But I find that all this atmosphere must
be swept away if I am to see clearly along the lines at
which I am at present working. I am seeing nothing at
all, so far as my consciousness and experience are con-
cerned, if I
say
" God." Doubtless there are large numbers
of people who need such translations of the idea as may
be congenial to them. They need the idea of God as a
crutch, but what do they really know ? Many probably
will
regard me as blasphemous because I do not at all
accept their conveniences and conventions. I do not accept
them. On the other hand, I do not at all
regard myself as
an a-theist, for I cannot deny that of which I have no ex-
perience. I
certainly am an a-gnostic. I do not know
what the word " God
"
means save as interpreted by those
who are very likely as ignorant as myself. Hence, the God-
conception has no meaning for me in these regions of
adjustment. If I look for God, I can only find either a
tremendous variegated thought-from, fabricated out of the
conceptions which the millions of God-believers hold in
their various consciousnesses, or in tremendous contrast I see
some exalted Personage who is, in fact, as mighty a Being
as any of the noblest God-conceptions that may exist, but
who never receives an appellation which is so exclusively
man-made.

largely an appearance from below.
Life is a Reality from above. God is a localization. Life
is a universalization.
540 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
The Symbols | see that the symbols which I have been endeavour-
point to Life
ing to describe in the course of this book are not only
symbols of landmarks on the great Evolutionary Way, but
are also compasses which point as unerringly to Life as the
compasses we know down here point to the North. These
symbols are variations on the theme of Life. They are
naught but Life, and from the standpoint of Life have,
I should imagine, no separate existence, though I cannot
perceive them apart from their individuality. Somehow,
they are so tremendously individual that when the pendulum
swings over to Individuality, its Universality gifts seem to be
drowned, unless this intimation of their Oneness is in reality
that which the pendulum brings from the Universality Pole.
The Symbol of AS I write, I am trying to perceive, since the moment
seems propitious, that Symbol of Life which is the summa-
tion of the great symbols revealed to me by my Teacher.
Each symbol is now pointing, as ever, of course, directly to
Life. There is a fusion of pointing. What do I
perceive in the
fusion ? I cannot answer this question. To answer is to
limit. I can only sense a Pre-ness which ! so call because
while in it is the whole of Manifestation, also in it is the
Unmanifest. In this Pre-ness is Life as we know it and
Life as we do not know it. And since the Unmanifest is so
infinitely more than the Manifest, I must needs sense the
Greater far more than the less. I use the word Pre-ness
to suggest an infinite background of which the Manifest, as
we know it, and the Unmanifest, as we do not know it, is but
a mode. I use the word Pre-ness so as to convey my
sense of an almost unimaginable perhaps I
ought to say,
quite unimaginable boundless Ocean of positive Darkness,
Silence, Formlessness, containing within itself infinite Light,
infinite Sound, infinite Form. In the Darkness is the Light,
In the Silence is the Sound. In the Formlessness is the
Form. I have been tempted to use the word Potent/af/ty,
but this would be a grave mistake. The only word I
THE LIFE MAGNIFICENT 541
could possibly use is Actuality, for in this great Ocean
everything is actual, even though I am constrained to
emphasize the Darkness-idea, the Silence-idea, the Form-
lessness-idea, because I want to convey the impression
that the stupendousness of Life, as we know it
especi-
ally, perhaps, through astronomy and through physics, is
as nothing compared with that reserve Stupendousness, of
which the stupendousness we know is
practically as nothing,
life's Toys We may be amazed at the marvels of the universes, of the
galaxies in the inconceivably astronomical distances, of
the magnificent laboratories of Life. But all these seem
to be as the playthings of Life Life's toys. As this
experience streams through my being, I feel utterly
ashamed of having in the beginning of this chapter written
about the casting of the net in which to capture Life.
Fortunately I had the decency to describe Life in terms
of the net. But what did my net catch ? Just a few con-
ceptions Unendingness, No-Beginning, No-Ending, No-
Movement which, as I am seeing now, have no relation
whatever to this Pre-ness save that there may be some
small modicum of truth in them. In any case I must
have some kind of net in which to capture the un-
capturable.
The Essence of I think that in the above experience I have entered
life ?
as far as I can go into the Essence of Life. And as I
write these words I find myself being told that I am no-
where near the Essence of Life, that it is an impertinence
for me to have imagined for a moment that I could enter
into Life's Essence, even on its frontiers. The suggestion
is that I have seen a shadow nothing more. How true
this is, as I now see. But I leave on record the evidence
of the impertinence.
Life is Vertical If I return to regions with which I am able to have
more acquaintance, it is curious how insistently I feel myself
compelled to say that Life is vertical in addition to those
542 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
characteristics of Unendingness, of Unbeginningness, of
Wholeness whatever these may mean. I now add the
adjective
"
vertical," because I see that my net has this
characteristic in addition to the others. I think that I
say
" vertical
"
because in these lower regions Life must needs
be characterized by a sense of its resistless Downpouring.
The avalanche-idea is
part and parcel of any conception of
Life which it is
possible to gain in these regions. On the
other hand, I think I
ought to say that in manifestation
Life is vertical, and therefore the adjective is not quite
as remote from accuracy in a certain sense as I have
perhaps suggested.
The Line of Life If I look at this earth of ours from the mountains of
ihose inner regions in which I am for the time dwelling,
I see that it is a bead threaded on a downpouring of
Life.
1
Indeed, I see all other worlds also as beads
threaded on a great Downpouring Line of Life. Neither
this earth nor all other worlds and universes seem to be
dotted about in space as they look from down here. They
seem to be beads on a Line of Curvature. For it must be
understood that when I use the word "
vertical," I am not
thinking of anything straight. I know of no straightness but
only of curvature. And with regard to this particular earth,
I see the downpouring of the curved Line of Life, rushing
through the North Magnetic Pole, then streaming through
the earth in all its parts and streaming out through the
South Magnetic Pole.
2
But I find myself immensely
disliking the idea of a streaming in and of a streaming outr
for while I have been writing of downpouring, in very
1
Compare the idea of the Sutratman, the Thread-Self, on which the per-
manent particles are threaded as
"
beads on a string," of which Dr. Besant,
in A Study in Consciousness, Chapter IV, has said :
"
This term is used to
denote various things, but always in the same sense, as the thread connecting
separate particles. It is applied to the reincarnating Ego, as the thread on
which many separate lives are strung , to the Second Logos, as the Thread on
which the beings in His universe are strung ; and so on. It denotes a
function, rather than a special entity, or class of entities."

THE LIFE MAGNIFICENT 543
truth I
might equally have written of up-pouring or
upwelling.
And this great Line of Life may be seen as Spindle-
curved and Fasces-formed through the magnetic influences
of the Northern and Southern Poles. There is deflection,
or inclination, or curvature, as the Line of Life enters the
mass of the earth.
Poles of Life I should very much like to correlate the Magnetic Poles,
the true Poles, with the so-called North and South Poles,
which seem to me to be true from the standpoint of Form,
as the Magnetic Poles are true from the standpoint of Life.
There must be a very definite relation between the North
Magnetic Pole and the North Pole, just as there must be a
very definite relation between the South Magnetic Pole and
the South Pole. Similarly there must be a very positive
relation between all four Poles. And I find myself wonder-
ing if the North Poles represent what we call the Sun,
while the South Poles represent what we call the Earth.
1
I seem to perceive a positive Sun-ness in what we call
the North and a positive Earth-ness in what we call the
South. And just as in the physical body, the earth forces
upwell through the feet, so do the Cosmic Earth Forces
upwell through the South Poles. If this be true, it must
therefore follow that just as the sun forces downpour
through the head, so do the Cosmic Sun Forces downpour
through the North Poles. It thus becomes a little more clear
how the various magnetic swirls are fed both by Southern-
Polar Magnetisms and by Northern Polar Magnetisms. We
may, however, go a step further and perceive the Equator
as in no sense an imaginary line, but as formed by some
junction effect of the Southern and the Northern Magnet-
isms. There must also be some relationship which I am
unable to perceive at all between the Southern Magnetic

Pole and the North Pole, and between the Northern
Magnetic Pole and the South Pole. I almost seem to see
some kind of geometrical figure emerging with the four
Poles as its four Points.
All this interaction is an expression of the vibrations of
Life, for, while I have described Life in terms of various
qualities, I must also describe it in terms of movement.
But I must hasten to add that this movement is Pre-
movement, the progenitor of Movement, and must not be
at all conceived in terms of movement as we know it down
here. It is, of course, the Ceaseless Breath of God, to
which I have made frequent reference throughout this book.
But I dare not try to define the nature of this Breath, lest
I take away from its Pre-Movement-ness.
One very important consideration enters into all this,
though it is a consideration the implications of which I
do not at all understand. There is a very definite measure
of inclination or shall we say Curvature between these
four Poles. They interact, and the interaction looks like the
interplay between Life as such (the Magnetic Poles) and
Form as such (the ordinary Poles). But in the regions in
which I find myself for the time being, there is, of course,
no essential distinction between Life and Form.
Herein lies much of my difficulty, for in Life there is
no distinction, such as we draw, between pairs of opposites.
The Pairs of Opposites are fused into one, even though
the Arundale illusion, and probably all other illusions too,
require a distinction to be drawn between downpouring
and upwelling. However, for the moment, I must think of
this Curved Line as streaming downwards through the earth,
and I dare not confuse the issue by suggesting simultaneity
of upwelling. Yet the fact remains, though I must recede
from it if I am to be intelligible down here.
I want to venture upon the observation that if there
were not this curvature of the vertical, it would seem,
THE LIFE MAGNIFICENT 545
in some strange way, as if there could be no manifestation.
There is a very definite relationship between Curvature
and Manifestation, between the curvature of Life and the
universes and worlds as we know them. In the fact of
Curvature lies Manifestation-Potentiality, for I find that
the act of manifestation involves adjustment I do not
think I
ought to say, modification in the essential Curvature
of Life, in what I
might call the essential Cosmic Curvature.
All forms have inherent in them the Life of the spirit of
Curvature. Life geometrizes, and I seem to see this
geometrization as an incarnation of that Curvature for which
another very significant word is
"
inclination."
Reverence is
Interestingly enough, if I
try to draw this Curvature-
Curvature
Inclination from the centre to the circumference, I find that
one of its expressions, but, of course, only one, is the
whole idea expressed in the word Reverence. Reverence
is an outward and visible sign of the inward and spiritual
Curvature-Inclination. It becomes so clear, as one lives
momentarily in these inner regions, that there is
nothing
even at the outermost circumference which does not reflect
the very soul of the centre. Every symbol described in
this book depends, among other dependencies, upon the
Curvature of Life. Even the Point, formless as we conceive
it to be, in some formless way reflects Curvature. Indeed,
it is a concentration of Curvature. Of course, we could
not visualize, still less describe, any symbol without bringing
it into our perspective by endowing it with this quality of
Curvature. Endow it as we may with all those negations
with which we describe the universe beyond the uttermost
limitations of our affirmations, each symbol must be to us as
explicit as we can make it.
Life Surgmgs One of the most interesting effects of this downrush
and upwelling of vertical Curvature is to be seen in those
magnetic lines of force which emerge from the Magnetic
Polar Centres. I see that the great Rulers of the World
35
546 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL

Government of

The Line-Force
distribute the life which surges through them, which is
available to this particular world, partly through the three
magnetic lines of force isogonal, isoclinal and isomagnetic.
I must refer the reader to any book on terrestrial magnet-
ism, or to the Encyclopaedia Britannica of various editions,
for such detailed descriptions as are so far available of these
extraordinary forces with all their most intriguing variations
from decade to decade. Indeed, I
hope that some instructed
Theosophist may some day examine these forces with
special reference to world vicissitudes.
In any case I feel I must make bold to say that the
Inner Government of the world uses this avalanche of Life
for the purposes of world evolution, and that the strange
magnetic geometrical swirls of force, sometimes open and
sometimes closed, which are in part given in magnetic
maps are in fact this Real Government's manipulation of the
available Life Forces, so that Life in manifestation on the
earth may be stimulated to all lawful extent.
Both Poles are vortices on the vertical Line of Life,
and the function of the entry vortex is
comparatively clear.
But the function of the exit vortex, if it be an exit at all,
remains obscure. But I also see that while this earth is, as
it were, attached to this Life Line, the Life Line itself continues
on its way, coming from the North of Being, rushing on-
wards and onwards, threading innumerable universes and
worlds, innumerable spaces and times, innumerable Men,
sub-human, human, super-human, non-human all as it
would appear in one endless Line, globes though we may
think we see, circles, forms, shapes innumerable.
I see Life as a vertical curved Line. But I see also
that by the word line, as by the symbol Line, I must mean
Force, and that the quality of Curvature frees this Line
from our ordinary conceptions of Line-ness. In this qual-
ity of Curvature, Line-Force becomes applicable to an
infinite number of permutations and combinations of
THE LIFE MAGNIFICENT 547
Line-Force giving us all the sciences, all the arts, all the
laws. The basis of every science is Curvature. 1
The basis
of every art is Curvature. The essence of every atom is
Curvature, or it could not grow."
Seeing crooked
Straightness is a convenience of ignorance. As I have
said before, we try to see straight when it would be far
more useful if we tried to see crooked. We must beware
of thinking at any time that we have come to conclusions.
At any stage of evolution there are no conclusions, only
expedients, theories, conveniences, inferences. There can
be no dogmatism of any kind. Always, when we utter
the phrase : "At least we can say this , . .
," we are
in all
probability I think I would say, in all
certainty
affirming when at the most we should only postulate. I
cannot think of any affirmation in any department of life
which might not, which in all
probability will not, be subject
to drastic modification.
The Lotus Bead | have wrjtten of this Life Line threading innumerable
universes. I am inclined to believe that there are many
stages of perception with regard to all things.
When our faculties are at perception temperature O,
then we perceive not at all. We are, but we are not
aware. Whatever impingements may be upon us, they
evoke only negative response in the waking consciousness.
But the temperature rises as we grow, and we perceive dif-
ferently according to our stage of unfoldment. This is true
as to all
sight physical and every other. And when we
come to the more cosmic perceptions this truth remains. We
are told that the universe appears to advanced perception
as a mighty Lotus, with the worlds at the tips of the petals.
I can quite well believe this, even though I have never seen
it. But at a still further stage of perceptual unfoldment I

548 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
venture to think that perhaps the very Lotus itself becomes
resolved into a bead upon a Line, perhaps a Point upon
a Line. And who knows? There must be perception
upon perception beyond, as veil upon veil lifts from
the inner eyes. But have I now, adding all this, come
nearer to the knowledge of the nature of Life ? What

self, as far as possible unconcealed by forms. Thus, groping,
I
begin to see that if I can somehow go backwards from
Form, I
may be able to some small extent to penetrate into
the shadow of Life. I am standing up. Immediately
previously I was sitting down. The connecting link between
the two, so far as channels are concerned, were the activ-
ities in the brain which produced muscular modifications,
and a number of other modifications at the scr^e time more
or less noticeable more noticeable under certain condi-
tions as, for example, those of ill-health, less noticeable
under certain other conditions as, for example, those of
free equilibrium. But whence come these changes ?
Whence is their immediate origin ? They may immediately
originate in the desire consciousness, or in the mind con-
sciousness, or in a combination of the two.
1
They may
immediately originate in the instinctual consciousness. And
they may also originate in a super-mental state of conscious-
ness. But if I
go farther back than that, I see a channel
between myself and the curved vertical Line of Life, of
which I am a projection -counterpart. I am a curved vertical
Line by which I mean that the Life concentration which in
this aspect of its projection we call, for the moment,
George Sydney Arundale, and which is linked by a pipe to
the reservoir which we call Life, is, literally, an offspring of
Life, resembling Life in every particular, in every one of
its qualities.

to see a Line between myself and the curved vertical)'
Line of Life of which I am a projection -counterpart. And
down this Line, which is, of course, Life itself, there flow
what are so rightly called
" wavicles
"
and also quanta,
spurts or wave particles of Life, which constitute my Life,
an individual concentration out of a universality expansion.
I am in the region of relatively ultimate vibrations, that is
to say, vibrations out of which all vibration-expressions
which we know down here issue forth. Desire is a mode
of these ultimate vibrations. The physical-plane con-
sciousness itself is a mode of these ultimate vibrations. So
is the mind consciousness. So is the very mechanism
itself. So are all Life's shadows in this shadow world of
life. The result is that, within the limits of the concentra-
tion that is
George Sydney Arundale, there is Life. I,
George Sydney Arundale, am a curved vertical Line, and
I have all the properties of the curved vertical Line, in
miniature.
am Life Thus it would seem that I have to go no farther than
myself for an understanding of Life. I can perceive Life,
naked if the expression be permitted when I remove the
whole of the mechanism of standing up and seek to face
that which sets the mechanism in motion. Truly, the
mechanism is
part of Life. It is
inseparable from Life.
But it is Life in a mode of vibration. I seek to isolate, so
to speak, that which gives rise to modes.
But, as I have said before, this isolating requires that
I shall rush to hold the pendulum of Life as, swinging from
the Pole of Universality, it comes for a moment within the
.
range of my Pole of Individuality. I must be alert to note
the flashing change which the pendulum produces upon
my consciousness, before it
swings back again. I am afraid
550 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
The Churning of
Consciousness
I see Darkness,
Silence,
Formlessness
lest these words confuse the reader, but I am writing down
as best I can the nature of the impacts upon my conscious-
ness as a whole.
There is aroused in me a rapid oscillation of my own
consciousness between myself down here, or out here, and
the eternal, essential, stuff of me. I can say that the
swinging of the pendulum within my consciousness so stirs
up my consciousness that, as it were, the lighter parts
float to the surface, while the heavier parts descend to the
bottom. I write in these terms for there is a sense of such
a happening. But more truly might I write of a separation
of the modes of my consciousness, so that I am able to
perceive foreground modes and background modes, with
emphasis on the latter.
And then I recede from the foreground modes and
pass into those background modes which reflect, and in
truth embody, the Universality which the pendulum has
brought streaming with it, and which, therefore, form an
area of reconciliation between those pairs of opposites
which function in apparent irreconcilability in the area of
Individuality. It is indeed an event of major significance
for me to perceive, with the aid of the magic pendulum, a
veritable identity between all pairs of opposites, so that
there is a Oneness out of which my individuality is
constantly seeking to snatch me. And what is
very
specially curious is that the very insistence of my individuality
almost, but not quite, compels me to describe this very
Life which is one without a second, which is the " All
"
and not any part, which is Life in toto, which is the
Father of all dualities and trinities, in terms of the more
remote of the pairs of opposites, so as to give me a sense
of getting away from modes and forms as much as I can.
Not only do I find myself calling this Life darkness, but I
also find myself seeing darkness. Not only do I find my-
self calling this Life silence, but I also find myself "seeing
"
THE LIFE MAGNIFICENT 551

life
silence and this is
quite possible, remember. Not only
do I find myself calling this Life formless, but I also find
myself
"
seeing
"
formlessness which again is
quite possi-
ble, remember.
The result is that I am not seeing Life, for I am im-
prisoned by the mode of me which looks. But with a very
great effort I can for an instant of time break supremely
loose from this mode, I can be free, I can be released,
just for a lightning-flash, and then I see that substans
which is
darkness-light, which is silence-sound, which is
formless-form. I am seeing this now before I start to
write. I lean back upon my chowki (a
kind of little plat-
form) and I
" see
"
which means I AM. But I am com-
pelled to return. I cannot stay where I am and at the
same time be here not, that is to say, at my present
stage of evolution and in my present mode of conscious-
ness. So I must come back, and I
"
see
"
no longer, and
have to take refuge in the remotenesses of darkness,
silence, formlessness. . . .
On the other hand, I can remember the vaguest of
intimations, and I can make statements which are true to
me although I can neither describe them, nor can I
say down
here that I know them in my waking consciousness. But
at least I
remember, or perhaps it is that I still
"
see," what
I have called Pre-ness, for it is that which is the Before-
Background which remains in the waking consciousness,
that Before-Background out of which streams the whole of
the foreground. The foreground is Individuality. The
background is
Universality the Pre-foreground, and I think
of this, in relation to the foreground itself, as having the
inherent quality of antecedence. "
In the beginning was
the Word. ..." This is the antecedence, the Pre-ness.
I thus feel I have been right in emphasizing the
Pre-ness, though I see very clearly that even this is a
mode. Yet it takes us out of those modes, with their
552 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
permutations and combinations, which form the complex
world in which we live and move and have our being. This
Pre-ness is, of course, essence ; but it is universal essence.
It knows no distinction of Macrocosm or Microcosm, be-
cause it is both. It knows no distinction of Light or Dark-
ness, because it is both. It knows no distinction of Sound
or Silence, because it is both. It knows no distinction of
Form or Formlessness, because it is both. It knows no
distinction of Vibration, because it is all vibration. It is
Father-Mother in unity and in duality. It is Father-Mother-
Son in trinity as well as in unity. The Christ Himself was
gazing upon Life when He said :
" I am the way, the truth,
and the life." It is a Life which is Movement and at the
same time Movementless. It is an infinitude of Vibrations
and at the same time a universal and perfect Stillness. It
is
unending and unbeginning. It is a Whole both infinitely
microcosmic and infinitely macrocosmic, and neither in the
microcosm nor in the macrocosm is there any Ring-Pass-
Not. The Ring-Pass-Not is but a mode among its literally
innumerable vibrations.

I have spoken of Symbols. I now find that, where I
am, Life is Symbol-less, though in a mode it is
Symbol-ful.
I have spoken of Life as Yoga. Life is
Yoga-less, though
Yoga is a mode whereby Life in individuality gathers up all
modes of Life's vibrations and gazes upon their Universality.
Indeed do I seem to see that I am right when I
say,
as I said in the beginning of this book, that Yoga is neither
denial nor relinquishment, but is the fulfilment of all things
as Life.
We may call this X which effects the change from a
sitting to a standing posture Life, but Life in a mode of
kingship not in a mode of a servant. Truly, there are in-
numerable kingships beyond this kingship in the great line of
Life as king. But this Life is a king-point in the line, at all
events with reference to its servants of the mind, of the feel-
ings and emotions, of the physical-plane consciousness as in
the brain and in all the systems dependent from the brain.
We may call this mode of Life by the name of Will
or Self-Expression or Self-Determination. It is a mode of
the living of Life. It is a mode of the spirit-matter of
Life. All we see around us is
Life-Expression, nothing
more, but nothing less. In every kingdom of nature itself
a mighty form-concentration we see innumerable depend-
ent form-concentrations. Manifestation itself is Concentra-
tion, either in formless or in form concentration. And if
we choose we can use the word " Will
"
as conveying more
to our limited understanding than the word "
Life," since
we used to be I
hope we have ceased to be foolish
enough to think we could distinguish between Life and
Death, between the organic and the inorganic. Some-
times, when I am told that so-and-so is no more, I feel
554 FROM THE SYMBOLS TO NO-SYMBOL
Life is Substans
He who seeks to
reverenca seeks
safely
irresistibly impelled to answer that at any rate he is no less,
for this is the truth. Life is universal, and there is no Death
but change, but metabolism, if
you will, or equally truly
adjustment.
The most so-called, and unscientifically called, inani-
mate object is
supremely animate, Life-ful. A table is not
only a piece of Life, but a colony of lives. So is every
form in every kingdom of nature. Life lives in colonies, in
groups of individualities. And Lrfe is substans which is the
essence of Life, or an essence, and substance, which is the
or rather a form of Life. Will, therefore, is substance
with its
pervading substans. But what more can I
say
about it ?
I do not think I can say anything *nore about it, for
its power is not only ultimate (relatively)
but sacrosanct.
And only to the holy shall the things that are holy be re-
vealed. The scientist shall never know in the region of
ultimates until he is holy, until he seeks, not for knowledge
even, for the pursuit of knowledge even for its own sake is
one of the most dangerous of paths a path which has led
to the prostitution of science to most ignoble ends ; not for
humanity's sake how many crimes are committed against
love in the so-called service of humanity ; but for the sake
of his own richer equipment to serve the whole world in
all its kingdoms of nature, in all its modes of life a service
which can never be at the expense of one form of life for
the sake of another form of life. At present many of our
scientists discover and then give their discoveries to the
world, reckless as to whether good or ill comes of their
gifts. The world needs knowledge, they say. Knowledge
alone, they say, can serve the world. So let knowledge go
forth at all costs. These are not holy men. They are men
who may have deep knowledge, but have little wisdom. So
do they become a menace to all
living things. They are
children who play with dangerous toys, but who do not
THE LIFE MAGNIFICENT 555
The Purpose of

Fulfilment and
.Release
know that they are children, for the world acclaims them
as great and loads them with honours. A little knowledge,
and it is all that any of them has, is indeed a dangerous
thing. But it
may lose its
dangerousness if with the aid of
reverence and love it be constantly distilled into wisdom.
No scientist is
worthy of his knowledge unless he has
reverence and love as his dominating qualities. To seek
for the sake of knowledge is not enough. Only he who
seeks that he may reverence more and more, and love all
living things more truly, seeks safely.
So is it that I cannot say more about Will, about Life.
Render unto men the things that are theirs, but only to the
godly the things that are of God.

Have I failed to give the description of Life which I
may have led the reader to expect ? In a way I have
failed, because I have not been precise. But in another
way I venture to think I have succeeded, for as this chapter
has proceeded, it has altered perspectives. It has perhaps
taken the reader beyond mechanism, beyond modes,
beyond all
pairs of opposites. But at the same time it has
in no place taken away the reader's essential freedom. It
is he who must know Life, not I who must know Life for
him. In any case, this I cannot do. But if at the end of
this chapter the reader feels free, as perchance he has not
felt free before, if the spirit of Consummation and Forth-
going are beginning to be radiant in him, if he becomes, as
never before, dynamic in the treading of his way, then he
may deny this book as he will, laugh at it as he will,
ridicule it as he will, forget it as he will, yet will it
have achieved its purpose, which is FULFILMENT and
RELEASE.

In scintillating rainbow rhythms streams forth the hair
flowing thickly from His head, as a divine waterfall dancing
in the rays of the Sun, or as dancing Ganga Mai, messenger
from Heaven to Earth.
With pearl-like light glows the crescent moon on His
mighty brow.
His deep-set eyes shine with the blue fire of the
thousand-petalled Lotus at noon-time.
His smile is an ever-flowing radiance of highest
Blessing, and in His hand is the Divine Drum rolling its
thunder-notes throughout the worlds, yet soft is this hand
as the young leaf, perfect in its shape.
He wears a tiger-skin as the garment of His Power,
and His uplifted hand sends forth its Protection.
The Jewels of Immortality sparkle in the bhell-like ears
of His perfect Understanding, and His Holy Thread is sacred
witness to His achieved Divinity.
His body is as the sacred coral consecrate to the Sun.
His skin is noble and strong as the skin of the mighty
elephant. As armlets are twined about Him the Serpents
of His Wisdom, and upon His ankles are the Bells of Divine
Music, the Music of the Gandharvas themselves.

Book Five-- Symbols at Work
THE AUTHOR QUESTIONS THE READER
I am hoping that those who are learned in the Arts and in the Sciences will
be able to instruct me as to the series of fundamental symbols epitomizing the various
departments of life which we associate with the Arts and Sciences Where possible,
I should be very glad if
correspondences could be suggested between my series of
seven symbols and a series in each of these departments insofar as an intuitive survey
might lead to an emergence of such a series.
What, for example, is the central, or relatively ultimate, symbol of mathe-
matics ? I am afraid I could not be satisfied with the reply that there is no such
symbol. At the most the reply must be that such a symbol or formula has not so
far been discovered. Is the Point in Symbolic Yoga the relatively ultimate mathe-
matical symbol, and if it be so considered, then how will it be defined mathematically ?
Can we associate conceptions of other symbols with the fundamentals of mathe-
matics? In other words, is mathematics a universe, and is it a growing universe-
invariable though its laws may seem to be or be in actuality
?
For my own part I cannot help feeling that while from one point of view this
great science is already, but entirely beyond our grasp, a science of relative funda-
mentals and ultimates, from another aspect it is a growing organism in ways I
am, of
course, unable to understand ;
and I feel that given the necessary developed intui-
tion, it would be possible to perceive the various Symbol-Laws or Formulas which
are related to the science of mathematics in the same way as the symbols I describe
are related to the growth of a universe.
Within the intelligence of man, within his intuition, within his power of self-
consciousness in the realm of theory, mathematics is a growing science, at least in
the sense that day by day new discoveries are made with regard to it, enabling the
student to proceed from a less to a more in his understanding of it. I conceive
that the matter mathematics represents and it does express a mode of life and
therefore of matter is itself an evolving entity, and that its expression in terms of its
relevant science changes as it grows Such invariableness as we may conceive with
regard to it may be represented by whatever in mathematics is called the Point.
But apart from that, changes take place along the lines of the other symbols,
which entitle us to conceive that however much from our limited and exacting
point of view mathematics is an exact science, it is none the less a growing science
Is natural law immutable and final ? For us the answer must be in the
negative, for we cannot know the real nature of natural law. We can only know
natural law as our present development permits, and that which is most natural and
36
562 SYMBOLS AT WORK
immutable to us is
assuredly less than its ultimate naturalness. I think this will be
admitted. We have no means at our disposal to declare that such and such is
a natural law from which there can be no variation. We can say we have no
experience of variation. But that is not saying very much. Change, unfoldment,
is universal so far as we are concerned, and we are constantly discovering that
there is
nothing so certain as uncertainty.
It
may be that there is an absolute Law, an absolute science, an absolute
art. But I do not think we can know them. And such experience as I have had
in the regions beyond the physical forces upon me the conviction that as all else
grows so does Law, so do the very laws of nature.
Is it
possible, then, to establish a growth in terms of symbols in every
science and in every art ? Or at least, as I have already asked, is there some
central or relatively ultimate symbol in each, of which it is
possible to have seme
conception, and to which some kind of expression can be given ?
As I ask in the case of mathematics, so do I ask in the case of every other
science, and so do I ask in the case of every art.
And I would ask, too, from individual students how far they are at all able
to determine their own symbolic unfoldment, their own unfoldment in terms of
symbol sequences. I
shpuld be very happy to receive from a student a symbol
series radically different from my own, and an intimation as to which symbol in
the series he feels he belongs, as I feel I
belong to the Line (vertical).
And I would like to insist that while hints are always welcome in these, for
us, so uncharted regions, all
discovery must eventually be truly self-discovery, and
not the impulse of a moment or two, but an intuitive perception checked and re-
checked. It is not enough for a student to say that he has always felt this, that
or the other. He must study. He must undertake investigation with the help
of all the best rules of investigation he can get hold of. He must experiment. He
must experience and experience, until he cancels out the spasmodic and irregular
and retains only the constant. This is what I have tried to do in connection with
my studies in Symbolic Yoga, for these studies are by no means just the result of a
sudden incursion into the regions of the science.
In any case, it is
appropriate to insist again that however much I
may have
been using the word "
Ultimates
"
as if there were no beyond and no change, I
can only use the word in a relative sense, for only the relative is at all self-conscious
in me, not my absolute, whatever it
may be if there be any absolute at all.
There may be those, moreover, who are able to tell me of the great
symbol of the vegetable kingdom, of the symbol in which animals live and move
and have their being, of the symbol of our Mother Earth Herself, and of Her
special familyHer mountains, Her seas, Her valleys, Her very atmosphere itself.
I feel I could know something of these symbols were I as near to Mother Earth
THE AUTHOR QUESTIONS THE READER 563
as I know some of Her sons and daughters to be. There are symbols of races and
nations as well as of faiths, and there are symbols of families as well as of individuals
Often, but not invariably, the flag of a nation may be intimately related to the
nation's actual symbol a shadow of it in colour-form.
After all, a symbol is a formula, a multum in parvo, an essence, an archetype,
an Eternal Now, which by those who understand may be unfolded into past, present
and future.
There is
nothing existing that cannot be unfolded, kneaded, poured which-
ever verb is most suitableinto its mould, or which cannot be reduced to a physical
formula so that out of the formula into which the object has been reduced it
may be
reproduced in its original state. It is a matter of the removal of dimensions and yet
of retaining dimension-potentiality.
Similarly, everything living should be capable of reduction to its symbolic
formula, to its state in terms of symbol. This should be possible not only with
regard to a single symbol, but with regard also, to the symbol-series to which it
belongs. To the occultist, for example, an individual man should be reducible or
should I
say, expansibleto his symbol terms, or to any one of them, and thereby be
gained a complete real history of the Man of the Sea concerned. He should be
traceable through every phase of his unfolding consciousness pre-mineral, mineral,
vegetable, animal, human, superhuman, and the great science of Astrology should
add to this local knowledge a knowledge of his planetary affinities based on symbol
identity so that his place in the macrocosm may be determined as well as his place
in the microcosm.
The Astrology known even by the most erudite astrologer is but a shadow of
the fringe of one of the mightiest of sciences, the Science of Cosmic and Sub-
Cosmic Formulas, the Science of the nature of Individual Uniqueness within a
Universal Unity. We have yet to gain even a slight glimpse of the intimate relation-
ship between this tiny and insignificant earth of ours and every other sun and planet
in the known and unknown universes ; between each individual life
imprisoned on
this earth and the totality of all other individual lives. I confess that my conscious-
ness reels at Ue thought of the immensities forthshadowed by what I believe is a
veritable Unity of Life a unity of the veriest details no less than a unity of the
mightiest of forces.
In fact, as, of course, the symbol of the Point reveals in all
clarity, the ques-
tion of size has no meaning in the worlds of symbol, and less and less meaning as
we leave the regions of slow motion and gain increasing access to the regions of
more rapid vibrations, thus approaching, though certainly not contacting, those
realms in which the Eternal lives in the unmodified terms of its own nature.
I should not deny to size a relative reality, for all is real just as all is Life.
Perhaps I
may have to say that even the word relative should not be used, inasmuch
564 SYMBOLS AT WORK
as all
things have their absolute values, however much it
may be convenient to
postulate relativity about them. I should not deny to colour, sound or form a
relative reality, or, if
you will, an absolute reality. But colour, sound, form, size, space,
time, dimension seem to lose their particular and varying significances as first we
transcend the regions of form, whether concrete or abstract, and as thence we
transcend that radiance, that forthflowing, out of which the abstract-concrete worlds
are born. I do not like the words "
radiance
"
or
"
forthflowing
"
they seem still
to hold us within abstract-concrete regions. If
only languages possessed abstract
and super-abstract equivalents to their form-words, I should be able to draw upon
these for descriptions of the abstract and super-abstract conditions of consciousness.
I have deliberately brought every symbol down into the outer worlds of
colour, form and sound, though I
certainly have avoided size Each symbol has, for
me, clothed itself or should I not rather say Himself with the splendours of the
outer worlds, reflections as these are of the still more splendid glories of the inner life.
But I should like it to be known that if I raise myself to the very highest regions I am
capable in any way of contacting, these very symbols are to be contacted in
states of consciousness beyond every single one of the attributes with which they
have been associated for my remembrance and understanding.
There is a region in which each symbol, whatever be its individual nature and
purpose, exists as an existence, wherein there is, it
may be presumed, a differentia-
tion from the existences of all other symbols, but about which one dare not predi-
cate more than the word "
existence." I will admit, however, that in my own
individual consciousness pure existence using the word "
pure
"
as I
might use the
word "
vacuum" to hint at, for us, a state of non-existent existence has certain
sublimities connected with it. There is a sublimity of overwhelming, irresistible
potentiality. With this I associate the spirit of a sublime hush an existence
crammed with overpowering silence. So I find the words "
overpowering
"
and
"
overwhelming
"
by themselves sufficiently indicative of a certain aspect of these
existences. They transcend mountainously, stormily, lightningly, and in a sublime
depth of thunderousness. But the words
"
overpowering
"
and "
overwhelming,"
even if raised to their nth significations, are not enough. These existences also
convey to me the sense of impenetrable solidity a solidity that brooks no resist-
ance, that, as it were, advances crushingly as in a spirit of nemesis, though the
word " nemesis
"
is
entirely inappropriate. And with all this there is no contradiction
when they also convey to me the sense of infinite lightness, inconceivable tenuity,
'Etherealness
Indeed, in these existences contradictions become complementaries and
necessary one to another. In these regions all contradictions are resolved into
their identities.

ALPHABETS 2
The Initiates (Sons of God) gave the early alphabets to humanity not only
for the perpetuation of human thoughts and ideas, but as scientific sequences of
glyphs and symbols which would reveal to brother Initiates with the sevenfold
"
Key
'"
the secrets of Creation, human and cosmic. .
As Sound, the Word, the Tone (with its essential Rhythm), is the Creative
Potency behind all manifestation, each letter representing one aspect of this Potency.
Thus were expressed the 7 and 49 forces and states of matter.
The Senzar and Samskrit alphabets, and those of other occult tongues
(Egyptian, Chinese, Chaldean, Hebrew, and even Greek and Roman, etc.) besides
other potencies, have a number, colour
{
and distinct syllable for every letter. To

make any special syllable operative, it is
necessary to produce mentally the colour
as well as concentrate on the potency to be invoked.
The very shape of the letter also conveyed its meaning, some hints of which
are still
preserved in our modern alphabets, e.g., the letter I stands for Man (the
body erect) ; add a head and you have P (Paternity, Potency, etc.) The letter Y
indicates the left or right-hand path of magic, according to which fork is shaded.
The sound of the letter conveyed the feel of the hidden potency, I.e., the F
being a cutting sound like air rushing quickly through space, and is
correctly used
in such a word as Fury.
Thus each word and each letter was to the Initiate a mantric song or invo-
cation, a formula or succession of basic numbers, and an ideographical picture.
Every word was the true name of that to which it was applied, and the
Initiate could discern its hidden implications at a glance. When sounded, it
actually
invoked the potencies involved, and thus arose the tradition that one's true name
should never be revealed, nor should the true name of the Gods be spoken, but
rather should They be mentioned only in allegory by substitute names.
The mystery or
"
Secret Doctrine
"
Language Senzar from which the
Stanzas of Dzyan were translated, was universal in olden days before the confusion
of the
"
Tower of Babel," brought about by these same Initiates to protect their
sacred mysteries from an untrustworthy humanity. The Stanzas themselves are said
to be not so much an account, but rather a Manual of Creation.
1
Senzar was the
41
Mother-Samskrit
"
reported to have been brought from Venus by the great
Kumaras. Each letter in Senzar is made to yield several meanings, according to a
sign placed at its commencement. The Circle, the Circle with the central Point, the
Diameter, the Equal-armed Cross, the Tau, the Svastika, the Triangle, the
Quaternary, the Pentagon, etc., representing the Cosmic Self-moving Numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, etc., were important characters of this universal script and have
been Jcnown as such to the learned of all ages.
The Devanagari (Gods') script of Samskrit is a scientific arrangement of the
seven and forty-nine potent sounds. It includes the sum-total of human sounds
which are considered as a materially extended expression of the One Creative
Sound, and like the sacred Aum (the sound of which begins in the back of the
mouth with A, traverses the centre with U, and ends upon the lips in M) it
represents
all creative speech and powers. The 1 6 vowels, the spirit or soul of words, contain
the most occult and formidable potencies, as did the seven Gnostic vowels which
represented the seven Rays. The 35 consonants, the formal element of the words,
had innumerable combinations. The Laya or Mantric System of Yoga relates the
letters to the chakra petals as follows : The vowels to the Throat ; Ka to Tha to the
Heart ; Da to Pha to the Navel ; Ba to La to the Spleen ; Va to Sa to the Root ; Ha

ALPHABETS 567
and Ksha to the Brow ; the whole alphabet twenty times over to the Crown chakra.
Samskrit was said to have been invented by Sarasvatl, the wife or energy of Brahma,
the Creator.
As the cosmological process was revealed by Thoth, or Hermes, some 35,000
years ago, to neophytes during Initiation, they perceived and wrote down the
symbols relating thereto, which became the Natar Khari or hieratic Alphabet of the
sacerdotal speech of the Egyptians, a Devanagari into which Senzar largely enters.
It was also during Initiation that the Chinese Alphabet was created (which serves too
as the script of Japan). The modern 7arot is a dim reflection of the original
Alphabet of Thoth, which can be studied in its complete symbology on the
Babylonian cylinders or divining wheels in the British Museum, and elsewhere. The
Mayan script is almost identical with the Egyptian.
The Chaldean and Palmyrian with their child, the Kabalistic Hebrew script,
and its 22 letters, were regarded as the visible expression of the divine forces
inherent in the universal name of the Logos. As the letters also stood for numbers,
each word was on its face a number. Gematna was the science of applying to the
letters of a word the sense they bear as numbers and as shape. Jemura was per-
mutation, by shifting letters to obtain their anagrammatical meaning, etc.
An example of this science of Numbers is revealed in the word Alhim, the
mystic name for E/ofi/m, the creative Gods, which read anagrammatically yields 31415,
the Greek TT. (the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter being 3.1415
to 1). This is a significant number (1st) in the relation of its successive digits, i.e.,
the Triad, the
"
First or Vertical Line," the Quaternary, the
"
Second Line
"
and the
Pentagon ; and (2nd) in that the Elohim, the emanations or opposing radii (" diame-
ters ") from the Central Point, mark out the
"
Ring-Pass-Not
"
or Circumference of
the Universe.
Referring to the Book of the Golden Precepts, Madame Blavatsky says in the
Preface to The Voice of the Silence :
"
The original precepts are engraved on thin oblongs ;
copies very often on
discs. These discs or plates are generally preserved on the altars of the temples
attached to centres where the so-called
'
contemplative
'
or Mahayana (Yogacharya)
schools are established. They are written variously, sometimes in Tibetan, but mostly
in ideographs. The sacerdotal language (Senzar), besides an alphabet of its own,
may be rendered in several modes of writing in cipher characters, which partake
more of the nature of ideographs than of syllables. Another method (lug in Tibetan)
is to use the numerals and colours, each of which corresponds to a letter of the
Tibetan alphabet (thirty simple and seventy-four compound letters), thus forming a
complete cryptographic alphabet. When the ideographs are used there is a definite
mode of reading the text ; as in this case the symbols and signs used in
astrology,
namely, the twelve zodiacal animals and the seven primary colours, each a triplet in
568 SYMBOLS AT WORIC
shade, i.e., the light, the primary and the dark stand for thirty-three letters of
the simple alphabet, for words and sentences. For in this method the twelve ani-
mals five times repeated and coupled with the five elements and the seven colours,
furnish a whole alphabet composed of sixty sacred letters and twelve signs. A sign
placed at the beginning of the text determines whether the reader has to spell it
according to the Indian mode, when every word is simply a Samsknt adaptation, or
according to the Chinese principle of reading the ideographs. The easiest way,
however, is that which allows the reader to use no special, or any language he likes,
as the signs and symbols were, like the Arabian numerals or figures, common and
international property among initiated mystics and their followers."
THE ORIGIN OF LETTERS
"
As soon as a child is born and its mouth opens, the sound proceeding is
($[$
"
3?F ") a, as in smart ;
by its prolongation and curving (3)
or u, or oo, as in
ooze, is formed when the lips are nearing to meet each other. And no sooner
the lips meet than the sound of (fl)
or m generates itself and merges (33) into
aJcasf). Thus the sacred (sjf)
Om is
naturally uttered by the opening and shutting of
the mouth. The opened mouth or circle is the visible symbol of eternity.
"
To proceed :
Beginning with ( . ) point, and forming ( -) /me, or sign of
(a?),
we come to (3)
or unfinished circle, and enter the point ( , )
or (*?)
when the
circle is
complete which is another form of eternity, i.e ,
disappearance of sound or
shabd into eternity, ($If9)
or cipher, point or akasfo-
"
The original framers of letters kept the broken or unfinished circle
(
)
)
of
(3)
u for the sound or svar it
represents.
"Now by combining these three 3f (
T ),
3 (J and *T ( . )
we get a-
figure ([), i.e., a line passing through the circle dividing it in any two segments.
By placing the different parts or portions of the figure in several positions
we get
"
(i 17) or tfJT, one of the chief names of Vishnu or Maha Vishnu. Thus our
Vaishnavites repeat and worship (3ff)
Om in a modified form and name suitable to
them and sacred to their Deity.

represents Shakti and is one-letter Mantra of Shaktas or followers of Shakti
the common name of every representation and manifestation of Maya or t{
or Mother.
"
TOR represents Maheshvar also.
"
On shutting the opened mouth the closing svar or sound is
(*}),
; e , the
sound merges into Akasn or Vyom and Shiva is
Vyomesh.
ALPHABETS 569

Taking the two sides of the circle with and without line separately [) (]
Shiva and
(f^fl) Shiva, both are represented. Shaivites have thus taken and
formed their deities' names from the same common origin. All the three
principal sects derive the symbols representing their names from the circle
and the line.
"
Originally all the alphabets were crudely shaped by taking separately
or combining together the broken portions of the figure (J). Gradually, and as
time rolled on, symmetrical and polished shapes evolved out of the Samskrit
alphabets, and those who trace the origin of all the known alphabets and their dif-
ferent transformations to Samskrit letters stand on firm ground.

THE ORIGIN OF SAMSKRIT
"
. . . that ancient sacerdotal language ... a language known to all occultists.
not a language of letters, as letters are understood in our modern tongues, a
language of signs, of symbols, of colours, of sounds, which rings out in music as well
as shines in colour, and which takes its own forms, which every Initiate can
recognize and translate into the lower languages of the intellectual world.
It has sometimes been called the Zenzar. It has sometimes been called the Deva-
Bhashya. . .
"
Many names have been given to the language ; names matter not, for they
vary with every tongue ; but the essential thing is that such a language exists, that
it is known today as it was known a million years ago, that people learn it now as
they learned it then, that occult instruction is
given in that language, and not
in the clumsy sounds articulated by a physical tongue, and that from that
language truths are translated into the most ancient intellectual tongues derived
from it. The Vaidik Samskrit is the most ancient intellectual echo of that

ATJAR of Experience
ANNIE BESANT :
"
And it is elsewhere said that Atma is like the breeze which
plays over a garden of flowers. It does not gather the flowers, it does not pick the
blossoms, but when the breeze has entered the garden and played over the fra-
grant blossoms, it
picks up from each blossom its peculiar fragrance and carries that
fragrance onwards, so that when it leaves the garden, it is enriched with the varied
fragrance of the different flowers. No longer as it came in, without scent, without
sweetness, but gathering up the scent of the flowers it
goes on, retaining the fra-
grance it has garnered.
"
And so with Atma in the world of manifestations. It does not gather
phenomena themselves, it does not take as it were the experiences themselves, but
by a subtle process it uses the bodies, the bodies of action and of feeling, for the
gathering of experience, and then the Soul gathers up the fragrance, the aroma as
Jt were, the ideal reflection of the experiences, and carries them forward with it till
the pilgrimage of the Soul is over." Jhe Pilgrimage of the Soul

ANNIE BESANT :
"
We find ... in a great Indian book put into the mouth of
God the words :
'
I am the Life-Breath.' The thought would be more familiar to you
if I
quoted them from the Hebrew scripture, where it is written :
'
By the word of
the Lord were the heavens made ; and all the host of them by the breath of his
mouth
'
(Psalms. XXXIII, 6).
"
Now Breath is sometimes said to be Life and Life to be Breath, and in those
lofty regions the word Breath is not an ill-chosen word to use, for the great out-
breathing of the divine Life which, gathering together from the boundless realms of
space a certain quantity of that far, far-off matter, makes, as it were, a ring round
it, in which He is
going to build up His new system, and breathes His life into that
enclosed root-matter, as it is sometimes called ; and by that Breath if I
may take a
very common illustration from right down here in the physical world, as you may, if
you breathe into a glass of water, create little vacua which are not really vacua, but
are filled with your breath and shelled with a little film of water creates the matter
out of which He will build His special system, His worlds.
BREATH, CIRCLE 571
"
In that form, subtle beyond our thinking, minute beyond our imagination
and yet if for a moment you will think of that building of a single form to which I
just now alluded you will know that from a single cell
you get a whole group of
cells by the forming within that simple cell of little lines of division, not separating
them off into separate things but making a mass of conjoined, adherent cells, so
bodying forth for us under our eyes, as it were, the great picture of creative activity
first Unity, the One, then within that Unity the delicate lines of separation, making
the many, still in union, these marked-out parts of future difference being still
joined
together , and then, later, in some forms of living creatures you may see the break-
ing asunder of these subdivided cells, and there you come to the picture of the
great separative principle, the intellect, at work, with its
offspring of the mind. And
then still further, passing downwards ever, you come to the appearance, in still
denser form of matter, of what we call attraction and repulsion, of what we call love
and hate when we come to human beings. And when you examine those, you
begin to realize that the Life, which is one, is ever seeking to reunite itself with the
several portions of itself that the impulse has divided coming down, but that the
Life in each separated form seeks the Life in other separated forms and tries to
draw them together, and the forms resist it, and the incongruous forms repulse it,
and a constant struggle goes on between the Life which is
seeking reunion and the
forms which are insisting on their separateness ; and you see how the forms gather
in fresh material in order that by grasping they may grow, and how the Life is ever
seeking to give itself out to find union with other lives, until we find ourselves down
here in a physical world of matter, and see its constant struggle, its constant opposi-
tion between the indwelling Life desiring to unite and the forms resisting, for fear
that in the union they should lose their individuality and no longer know themselves
as living beings." Britain's Place in the Great Plan, pp. 33-35

"
In the seven Planetary Logoi certain cyclic changes

to the beating of the heart down here on the physical plane."

"
[The Atlanteans] knew that every atom beats as a heart, and they con-
sidered that the sun had a similar movement, which they connected with the sun-

They thought . . . that the earth breathes and moves, and it is cer-
tainly true that quite recently scientific men have discovered that there is a regular

in a certain way to breathing." Talks on the Path of Occultism

H. P. BLAVATSKY :
"
The Incorporeal Intelligences (the Planetary Spirits, or
Creative Powers) were always represented under the form of circles. In the primitive
572 SYMBOLS AT WORK
Philosophy of the Hierophants these invisible circles were the prototypic causes and
builders of all the heavenly orbs, which were their visible bodies or coverings, and of
which they were the souls. It was certainly a universal teaching in antiquity. As
Proclus says [/n Quint. Lib. Euclid] :
"'Before the mathematical numbers, there are the se/f -moving numbers ;
before the figures apparent the vital figures, and before producing the material.
worlds which move in a circle, the Creative Power produced the invisible circles.'

COLOUR
It is
interesting to compare the first-hand observation of the colours of the
Great Symbols, with the first-hand observation of the colours called forth at the
censing of the Ray Candles quoted by C. W. Leadbeater in The Science of the
Sacraments, 1929 edition, p. 105 et seq.
As is
carefully stated by the observer of the censing,
"
It is not asserted that
these are the colours of the Rays, for it would require a very competent clairvoyant
to arrive at these with any certainty. The difficulties in the way are great, for various-
reasons. It seems likely that each Ray has a fundamental colour which can be
attributed to it, but this is overlaid by many others. There is perhaps some arrange-
ment by which they correspond with the colours of the spectrum, and they probably
modify their colours according to the needs of the world at the moment, which
depend on cyclic changes . . .
"
However, we can give the colours outpoured at the censing without
touching the question of the absolute colours of the Rays."
Ray I
"
has thin pencil of intensely bright gold, which is surrounded by the
wonderful and shining silvery electric blue, which is so often seen in connection with
this Ray. The surface of this outpouring is covered with silver sparkles, which it is
continually shooting off with a hissing noise."
Ray // : As this Ray is considered as the Altar itself, and the three principles
of the Trinity are there censed, it is difficult to judge just what is
presumed to be the
colour of the Ray. The first triple swing to the central cross and picture produces a
pure milk-white, which "
glows with a sweet softness."
"
The next three swings
induce a similar outrush of blue, from the Christ ;
and the last set bring down the
crimson of the Holy Spirit."
Ray ///
"
emits a fine sky blue and emerald, which suggest the colours of
certain blue and green opals like shallow sea water over a sandy bottom, when the
sun shines through it."
Ray IV : In some cosmogonies considered as representing Maya or the Un-
manifest which takes on various influences as they play over it.
"
This has its core of
COLOUR 573
a curious indescribable colour which approaches most nearly to a sort of translucent
magenta pink a strong colour, but with a very delicate shell tint. The pink
itself shades off by imperceptible degrees into an opalescent aqua-toned aura. The
body of the power is a splendid mingling of dark blue and green like a peacock's
breast ; and on the surface we see the same colour as at the heart, except that there
are only flecks of the magenta and much more of the opalescent effect. The
contrast of the magenta, seen against the dark ever-changing rush of mingling deep
blues and greens seems to make this curious cloud-like halo of opalescence look
almost like a beautiful aesthetic grey, but when one looks closely, one sees that there
are many soft colours in it which gleam out as the ever-restless stream throws them
more to the surface, and that the greyishness is
only the result of the contrast
between the strong almost metallic sheen of the darker colours, and the gentle aura
of this odd pink.
"
Possibly some of the colours of this Ray's power are due to its
long asso-
ciation with Egypt They may also have to do with its position as the central or
balancing position between the two sets of three on either side of it
"
Ray V "
produces a downpouring with a centre of a rich apricot red -
there is
orange in it and Martian red and a surrounding body of a beautiful and
singularly pure yellow. On the surface we have tiny flecks of the central colour
apricot."
Ray VI "in the centre is pure Martian red very strong and fiery the
colour that inspires martyrs. The main volume of the outpouring, that which sur-
rounds this central jet, is the most lovely rosy crimson the tenderest and purest
carnation shade really quite indescribable. Perhaps the nearest one can come to
it in
physical colours is seen in certain very fine rockets. . . . The Martian red
shows itself again in surface flecks."
Ray VII :
"
This downpouring is silver in the middle, a specially gleaming,
living silver which differs from the first-Ray silver in that the latter looks more like the
actual metal surrounded by white fire ;
while the former is more like a stream of
mercury which seems to exhale other tints as though it reflected them. This has a
more human and a softer feeling than the first-Ray power which is so intensely
positive strong as a line of lightning. Around this core, the seventh-Ray out-
pouring is a marvellous, transparent amethyst a regal colour which makes the heart
sing and speaks of the splendour of sunsets shining into stormy tropic seas ; but the
dark blue of those restless waters at or after dusk, is also there, and the flash of
moonlit wavelets is
suggested by the myriad flecks of silver which, as with the first-
Ray influence, dance off its surface."
When the censing has been completed, the Ray jewels
"
are fairly bursting
with radiations of light and glory."

sapphire, emerald and crimson, surrounding a hexahedron of gold, as shown in
Jhe Hidden Life in Freemasonry, by C. W. Leadbeater, is also an interesting study
in colour and living symbol, used by the angelic forces to exchange greetings with
other worlds. This book has many other symbols used throughout the mysteries
which make a comparative study of value.

COLOURS LIGHTNING-WHITE, GOLD-GREEN,
AS REFERRED TO IN NORSE MYTHOLOGY
Symbolic Yoga tells us of Green Men.
Astronom/ca/ symbolism as given in The Secret Doctrine and elsewhere gives
the colour of Saturn as green, and connects him with the Bridge which is in and
outside man, and is his battlefield and his way to Godhead.
Norse mythology tells us of the Bridge Bifrost which was the path from the
World of Men (Midgard) to the World of the Gods (Asgard) which in synthesis
was rainbow-coloured, yet where men beheld it "in the East" of their
world it was "
brightest green," and at its crest or height stood its Guardian-
Heimdall (meaning Heavenly One) whose armour shone as
"
white light
"
and whose hair, teeth, mane of his horse, etc. were golden. One poetic
version gives it :
"
Bifrost the east shone forth in brightest green ;
On its top, in snow-white sheen, Heimdall at his post was seen."
This does not give the lightning-white effect, but other references to it do give
exactly this quality and stress its brilliant Light within its whiteness.

CURVATURE 575
CURVATURE
Simple Harmonic Motion. "If a body moving with constant speed in a
circular path is observed from a distant point in the plane of the circle, it
appears
to oscillate back and forward in a straight line.
"
The kind of vibratory or oscillatory motion that the particle appears to have
in this case is known as simple harmonic motion, it
may be defined as the projection
upon a straight line of uniform motion in a circle.
"
There are other kinds of vibratory motion that are not simple harmonic,
such, for example, as the particle would appear to have, in the above instance,
if it moved around the circle in any manner whatever except with constant speed.
Simple harmonic vibration is, therefore, one particular mode of oscillation ; but it
is by far the most important, for it is the most common of all, and all other modes of
vibration may be expressed as the resultant of a sum of simple harmonic vibrations
as was shown by the French mathematician Fourier. . . .
"
The amplitude of the vibration is the distance that the vibrating body moves
on each side away from its central or mean position.
" From the laws of dynamics as well as from experiment there is reason to
believe that a simple tone, to which a resonator of only one certain pitch will
respond, is one in which the vibrations of the air are simple harmonic."
Circular and Elliptical Polarized Light. "... consider first what happens
when a beam of plane polarized light of one wave length passes through a crystal
plate.
In figure 609 the beam of polarized light is
supposed to be coming up
toward the eye of the reader. To avoid confusion, the crystal plate and analyser,
instead of being shown superposed on the polarizer as they would actually
appear to one looking along the beam, are represented as shifted to one
side so that each may be seen separately. The incident light is
supposed to-
be vibrating in the direction shown by the lines at P, with simple harmonic
motion, since it is supposed homogeneous. On meeting the crystal it sets up
vibrations in the same direction in the face where it enters as represented by
the line AB.
Polarizer Crystal Analyzer
576 SYMBOLS AT WORK
1 i 4 4 3 -i $ \
Fig. 610
"
But let us suppose that the crystal plate is
placed with its axis in the
direction DA or BC, at 45 to the direction of vibration in the incident beam.
Then the incident vibration, represented in amplitude and direction by A B, may
be resolved into the two equal components AC and BC, one of which (BC) is
parallel to the optic axis in the plate while AC is at right angles to the axis. These
two components are transmitted with different velocities, and consequently the
relation between their phases changes as they advance through the crystal.
"
As the difference in phase of the two components increases the resultant
vibration passes successively through the forms shown in figure 610.
"
When the thickness of the plate is such that one component is retarded
one-eighth of a period on the other, the light emerges elliptically polarized, as
shown in the second figure in the above diagram. In that case the analyser
resolves it into vertical and horizontal components and transmits only the horizontal
component, as shown in figure 609 at N.
"
If the crystal plate is of such a thickness that the difference in phase
between the two components is a quarter of a complete period, the resultant
vibration as it
emerges is circular. The emergent beam in this case is
circularly
polarized, and will be resolved by the analyser into two components of equal
intensity, one of which will be suppressed and the other transmitted, and there
will be no change in the intensity of the transmitted light as the analyser
is rotated.
"
When the retardation of one component or the other amounts to a half
wave length, the emergent light is plane polarized at right angles to the direction
of the incident beam and is
completely transmitted by the analyser ; while if the
relative retardation amounts to a whole wave length the light emerges vibrating
just as it entered and is
entirely suppressed by the analyser."

DIRECTIONS
The true earthly North and South are obviously fixed by the North and South
Poles, concerning the influence of which Madame Blavatsky has written in The Secret
Doctrine. See II, 418-19 (Adyar ed , III, 399-400) , II, 829 (Adyar ed , IV, 353) ;
I, 225-26 (Adyar ed., I, 253-54) ; and other references.
But what is East and West? The Tibetan, Hindu, Christian, Chinese, Masonic
and many other Faiths and Philosophies have ascribed certain influences to East and
West, North and South, which obviously seem difficult to understand if the arbitrary
"
O "
longitude of Greenwich is taken as a standard.
The student is advised in encyclopaedia and atlas, as well as in the journal on
Terrestrial Magnetism, to observe carefully the magnetic hemispheres. There he will
find the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are fairly consistent to the Polar Hemi-
spheres, though the Magnetic Poles lie at great distances from the geographical Poles.
But the Eastern and Western Magnetic Hemispheres are changing decade by decade
with even daily fluctuations. The student will see that the
"
O "
or agonic lines of
division between East and West are usually near India and mid-United States. In fact
the Americas seem a backbone continent with India as the heart of the world.
But many are the changing rhythms of these magnetic hemispheres. For
example, great waves of Eastern Hemisphere poured over Europe during the Renais-
sance, while Western Magnetism is now flooding Asia and India.
The Theosophist will be intrigued to note that at 1882 and 1907 Adyar was in
the laya centre between North and South, East and West, and that at the time The
Theosophical Society was founded the whole of the United States was "
Eastern."
He will also see with interest that those places reported by occultists to be the
cradles of the Sixth Sub-race all lie normally in a common Hemisphere the Eastern.
This unexplored field will yield fruitful returns if
investigated by the occult
student who can correlate the great events of the world with the changing spheres
of magnetic influence. A. H. P.

A Study In Consciousness
"
Electricity manifests only as positive and negative ; when these neutralize
each other, electricity vanishes. In all things electricity exists, neutral, unmanifest ;
from all things it can appear, but not as positive only, or as negative only ;
always as
balancing amounts of both, over against each other, and these ever tending to
re-enter together into apparent nothingness, which is not nothingness but the source
equally of both. . . . There is no such thing as a conscipus unit which does not
consist of this inseparate duality, a magnet with two poles ever in relation to each
other." Op. c/t., Chap. II

The chief deity personifies in himself the female as well as the male

The Samskrit term Shakti (literally
'
[Divine] Power ')
refers to the female
or negative phase of that divine force or power concentrated in or personified by
the consort of a god, the god representing the positive phase; the Tantric
worshipper of Shakti (Power), or divine universal forces, personified as a,
Mother-Goddess, being called a shakta. The Tantrics like the ancient Egyptians
exalt right knowledge of the reproductive processes, as no doubt it should be exalted,
to the level of a religious science ; and in this science, as illustrated in the Bardo
Th6cfo/, the union of the male and female principles of nature, in what is called in
Tibetan the yab (Sk. deva) -yum (Sk. shakti) attitude, symbolizes completeness, or
at-one-ment. Power symbolized by the male (yab, or deva), and Wisdom, sym-
bolized by the female (yum, or shakti) are said, esoterically, to be ever in
union." The Jibetan Book of the Dead, pp. 95, 106, 2\T

It is not advised, say some authorities, that all the seven planes be invoked
in this Mantra which brings down or up the light of the Sun from wheresoever it is

four words naturally correlate with the Earth, the Astral, Lower Mental and Causal
planes, that the last three lokas are located on the Buddhic plane, and above that
plane are located Brahma -loka, Vishnu-loka Vaikuntha and Goloka, with Shiva-
loka Kailasa.
"
As all Theosophists know, it is an invocation to the Sun of course, really
to the Solar Logos, who stands behind that greatest of ail symbols ; and the great
shaft of light which immediately pours down upon and into the reciter comes as
though from the physical Sun in whatever direction that Sun may happen to be.

The effect is
especially curious when the Sun happens to be below the horizon, for
then the shaft comes up at once through the earth f
This shaft is white just slightly
tinged with gold ; but when it has filled the very soul of the reciter he promptly
shoots it from him again in seven great rays having the colours of the spec-
trum. It is as though the singer acts as a prism ;
yet the colour rays which
dart forth are of a shape the reverse of what we usually find in such cases.
Commonly when we send out rays of spiritual force they spring forth from a
point in the body the heart, the brain, or some other centre as th ~.ase may
be ; and as they shoot out they steadily broaden fanwise, as do ,e shining
from a lighthouse. But these rays start from a basis wider than the w ,i himself
a basis which is the circumference of his aura, and instead of widening out they
decrease to a point, just as do the rays of a conventional star, except that they are,
of course, cones of light instead of mere triangles Another remarkable feature is
that these seven rays do not radiate in a circle in all directions, but only in a semi-
circle in the direction which the reciter is
facing Furthermore, these rays have a
curious appearance of solidifying as they grow narrower, until they end in a point of
blinding light. And a still more curious phenomenon is that these points act as
though they were living ; if a man happens to come in the way of one of them, that
point curves with incredible rapidity and touches his heart and his brain, causing them
to glow momentarily in
response. Each ray appears to be able to produce this result
on an indefinite number of people in succession ; in testing it on a closely packed
crowd we found that the rays apparently divided the crowd between them, each
acting on the section that happened to be in front of it, and not interfering with any
other section
Fig. 1
"... All the triangles which radiate from him have the diameter of his

582 SYMBOLS AT WORK
triangle ;
all the others on each side, having the same base but a different
inclination, are increasingly smaller and narrower as they are farther from the
middle line.
"
These are of course really cones ; and the size of the base of these cones is
determined by the size of the aura of the reciter. If he happens to be a quite ordi-
nary person with an aura extending perhaps eighteen inches from his physical body
on all sides, the base of the cones will be an oval, some nine feet in length by five
in width. If, however, he is a more developed man, with an aura extending
fifty yards on every side of him, that base will be almost a circle, as the difference
between the height and the breadth of his physical body would be practically negli-
gible in proportion to the size of the whole aura. As we are looking down from
above, we must draw a horizontal line through the middle of the man's aura to
represent the base of our triangles ; but as the force flows out horizontally
in front of the man, the circle which defines the base of our cone must be
thought of as a hoop standing not horizontally but upright about the man as
an arch over his head, involving of course a similar inverted arch beneath
his feet.
"
That is a curious fact regarding the aura which is
very often forgotten ; it is
built of astral and mental matter, which of course freely interpenetrates everything
physical ; so to whatever height a man's aura extends above his head, it has an
exactly similar extension into the earth beneath his feet . . .

If a number of people chant the Gayatri together, only one shaft of much

"As to the question of the language of the mantra, it seems to be of minor
importance. The recitation of the words in English having the full intention behind

them produced the full effect. The recitation of the same thing in Samskrit with
the same intention brought about exactly the same result, but in addition built round
the radiating shafts a sound-form resembling a wonderfully intricate kind of carved
wooden frame-work ; it
provided us with something which might be imaged as a
seven-fold gun through which the rays were shooting out. This sound-form extended
only for a short distance and did not seem to make any difference at all to the
power or size of the rays."
C. W. Leadbeater, Trie Jheosophist, April 1926
WESTERN . THE EUCHARIST OF THE PARSIFAL
One of the most significant symbolic stories of the Eucharist is the Parsifal
Opera of Richard Wagner. Amfortas, the King, representing humanity, was given
two treasures to guard the Holy Cup or Grail, representing Divine Love, and a
Spear, the Spiritual Will. Tempted by Kundry or Desire in a fight against Klingsor,
the principle of Resistance, he loses the Spear, and is
given a terrible wound, which
must be his until a Saviour appears to heal him.
Still in the Temple at Monsalvat, the Eucharist of the Grail is
performed, but
\t
gives its priest the greatest anguish to uncover the Grail without the Spear, its
sacred guardian. In the words of Amfortas :
"
The hour is
nigh. A ray descendeth
on the Vessel divine. The veil is raised. The sacred stream that flows in the crystal
glows with strength and radiant lustre. Filled with anguished delight, I feel this
heavenly flow of power pour into my heart. My own life current's sin-defiled flood
in delirious flight backward within me rushes, and toward the world where sin has
might with wildest dread it
gushes . . . ."
But at last a guileless boy, Parsifal, seeing the suffering of the King goes
forth to search for the Spear. Innocent, desire-free, he withstands the wiles of
Kundry, Klingsor's agent, and regains the sacred weapon.
At long last when the Knights of the Grail and the King have grown hopeless
with waiting, and the King refuses now to uncover the Grail, the Saviour Parsifal,
symbol of the Divine Christ Principle incarnate, enters the Temple. Saying,
"
One
Aveapon only cures. The Spear that pierced can heal thy bleeding wound," the
Parsifal makes whole the stricken King.
Raising aloft the Spear of the regained Will, there comes the magnificent
conclusion to this true Eucharist that of Love and Will in union :
"
Behold the Spear. O Knights, it is
your own ! O mighty miracle of Bliss I
The power pouring from the Spear, yearns to join the fountain glowing, whose pure
tide in the Grail is flowing. (To the guardians of the Grail) : So hid be no more
the cup divine, Unveil the Grail !
Open the Shrine."
Revivified with the vital Life of the Spirit, the Knights chant in prayer :
"
Holy healing Wonder ! Praise ye the Lord, Our Redeemer."

is much more than he was then, and feels that he includes within himself many other

FRAGRANCE-ESSENCES
C. W. LEADBEATER :
"
The use of incense is
perfectly scientific ... All
occult students are aware that . . . there is no such thing as really dead matter,
but that everything in nature possesses and radiates out its own vibration or combi-
nation of vibrations. Every chemical element has thus its own set of influences
which are useful in certain directions and useless or even hostile in others. It is irv
this way quite possible, for example, to mingle certain gums which, when burnt as
incense, will strongly stimulate the purer and higher emotions ;
'
but one could just
as easily make another mixture whose vibrations would promote the most undesir *
able feelings . . .
'
The incense used in the [Masonic] Lodge tends to purify that part of man's
nature which is sometimes called the astral body, as it is made of gums which give
off an intensely cleansing vibration ... It has also the effect of attracting denizens
1
Cf. The Mahatma Letters, pp. 283 and 323.
'586 SYMBOLS AT WORK
of the inner worlds whose presence is helpful to our working, and of driving away
those which are unsuitable . . .
"
If the incense is
intelligently magnetized its strength is increased enor-
mously ; for example, by putting into olibanum the definite force of the will in the
direction of calmness and devotion, its influence may be increased by perhaps a hun-
dredfold. That is
why the incense in church is
always taken up to the celebrant to
be blessed, and why in the Lodge it is brought to the R. W. M. in order that he
may magnetize it with whatever special quality he thinks will be helpful for the work
of the day.
1
The sprinkling of holy water in a church is another way of producing a
similar effect, but incense has the advantage that it rises into the air, and wherever
a single particle goes, the purification and blessing is borne with it ...
"
Practically all the religions of the world use incense in one form or another,
it
appears in the temples of the Hindus, the Zoroastrians, the Jains, and in the
Shinto of China and Japan. It was used in Greece, in Rome, in Persia, and in the
ceremonies of Mithras All these people, including the Roman Catholics, avail them-
selves of it, because they know it to be a useful thing ;
why then should not we?"
The Hidden Lite in Freemasonry, pp. 129-33
Censing the Individual. The censing of an Individual in a ceremonial has
the effect of "charging him with power" for the work his rank qualifies him to do.
"
Then the clerics, choir and people are censed in the order of dignity.
There is a threefold object in this : first, to show respect to them, as is evidenced by
the variation in the number of swings given ; second, to include them all within the
magnetic field ; third, to evoke whatever latent power of love and devotion there is
(in each, that he may take his full share in the great work which is about to be done.
The act of censing establishes a condition of rapport, of synchronous vibration,
which may be utilized to expedite the flow of force either outward or inward."
The Science of the Sacraments, p. 1 74
Angels of Incense.
"
In considering the many benefits which we gain from
the use of incense, we must not overlook the aid of the special orders of Angels
and nature-spirits which work by its means. The Angels of the Incense are of two
quite distinct types neither of them readily comprehensible except by those who
have devoted much study to such subjects. Such investigators know that there
are Angels of Music great beings who express themselves in music just as we
express ourselves in words- to whom an arpeggio is a greeting, a fugue a conver-
sation, an oratorio an oration. There are Angels of Colour, who express them-
selves by kaleidoscopic changes of glowing hues, by coruscations and scintillations
of rainbow light. So also are there Angels who live in and express themselves by
what to us are perfumes and fragrances though to use such words seems to
1

FRAGRANCE-ESSENCES 587
degrade, to materialize the exquisite emanations in which they revel so joyously. A
sub-division of that type includes the Angels of the Incense, who are drawn by its
vibrations and find pleasure in utilizing its possibilities . . . Incense is always efficient
in attracting the attention of any Angels who may happen to be in the neighbour-
hood . . .
"
There is also another kind to whom the title of Angel is less appropriate.
They are equally graceful and beautiful in their way, but in reality they belong to
the kingdom of the elves or nature-spirits. In appearance they resemble the child-
angels of Titian or Michael Angelo, except that they have no wings. They do not
express themselves by means of perfumes, but they live by and on such emanations,
ancl so are always to be found where fragrance is being disseminated. There are
many varieties, some feeding upon coarse and loathsome odours, and others only
upon those which are delicate and refined. Among them are a few types which are
especially attracted by the smell of incense, and are always to be found where it is
burnt. When we cense the Altar and thus create a magnetic field we enclose within
it a number of these delightful little elves, and they absorb a great deal of the
energy which is accumulated there, and become valuable agents in its distribution at
the proper time."
When the priest later says :
"
As this incense rises before Thee, O Lord, so
let our prayer be set forth in Thy sight. Let Thy holy Angels encompass Thy people
and breathe forth upon them the spirit of Thy blessing,"
"
it is a most beautiful sight
to see them swoop down the church shedding their influence over the congregation,
carrying with them the essence of the perfume and sending it
surging out in great
waves as they pass. The chief purpose of their effort is
expressed in the words
used by the Priest as he returns the censer :
'
May the Lord enkindle within us the
fire of His love and the flame of everlasting charity.'
"
As the Angels rush out
over the congregation,
"
they extend the influence of the magnetic field hitherto
kept to the Altar to include the whole church, but this is more definitely completed
and brought down to the physical level by the censing [before described], first of
the clergy and then of the congregation."
The Science of the Sacraments, pp. 104, 174, et seq.
Fragrances in Individual Life. The sense of smell is
very intimately related
to the physical body, and scientists have long known what a large area of the
cerebral content in the case of the animal kingdom is devoted to this sense. A
beautiful fragrance gives a thrilling uplifting sense obtained in its own unique way.
Conversely there is
nothing so repelling as an evil odour. Occultists tell us that as
people advance on the Path of Holiness, their bodies become more and more fragrant
and that the
"
odour of sanctity
"
clings to an object handled by such a one.
In his investigations into this intriguing field of incense-perfumes, Bishop
Leadbeater tells us how we can use their potencies to magnetize large areas
588 SYMBOLS AT WORK
(The Hidden Side of Things, II, 218). In his investigations he also found that some
incenses were purifying, some stimulating and inspiring, some sympathetic and
soothing, while some were definitely undesirable in effect, as, for example, amber,
musk, calamus root, galbanum, dragon's blood, etc., which attract a distinctly low
class of elemental.
Synthetic oils seem to have a similar though not so potent an effect as the
natural essential oils.
1
From a comparison of the subtle colours given for the various perfumed
1
incenses by Bishop Leadbeater, it
appears that these follow closely in most instances
the physical colour of the flower itself, and this released colour has its effect upon
all persons in its aura to arouse the corresponding qualities.
This close relationship of sound, colour and fragrance with the principles of
man is hinted at in The Secret Doctrine, III, 463 (Adyar ed , V, 442-43)
"
All the mental, emotional, psychic and spiritual faculties are influenced by
the Occult properties of the scale of causes which emanate from the Hierarchies of
the Spiritual Rulers of the planets, and not by the planets themselves. This scale
leads the student to perceive in the following order :
"
1. colour;
"
2. sound ;
"
3. the sound materializes into the spirit of the metals, i.e., the metallic
Elemental ;
"
4. these materialize again into the physical metals ;
11
5. then the harmonial and vibratory radiant essence passes into the plants,
giving them colour and smell, both of which
'
properties
'
depend upon the rate of
vibration of this energy per unit of time ,
"
6. from plants it
passes into the animals ;
"
7. and finally culminates in the
'
principles
'
of man."
PURIFYING INCENSE '
Most good incenses were found to have at least vaguely purificatory effect.
Especially potent is Benzoin which "
is almost savagely ascetic and purifying ; it deals
trenchantly with all the grosser forms of impure thought and is excellent for use in a
great cathedral crowded with somewhat undeveloped individuals."

It is a steely
blue-grey colour. Ba/sam of Peru has a milder but similar effect to Benzoin.

have a purifying effect on the mental body with their light yellow hue. Aloes Wood

STIMULATING AND INSPIRING INCENSE 1
Rose Attar, petals, etc., give a beautiful rose colour and open up the

Sandalwood is a chord of deep blue purple and golden yellow ;
it
gives
devotion of a very high type, and also has vibrations which will cut up and clear
away impunties. Too strong a concentration of sandal oil, like rose o//, has a tend-
ency to prematurely open the web protection between the physical and astral
planes.
Nero// or Orange Blossom Oil mingles a delicate rose and violet, plays upon
the higher astral, laying it
open to buddhic influence, so to speak, approaching
"
from
the other side to Rose." It
quiets the physical body and is rather good if one has
a headache
Jasmine, with its rose, pale green, and possibilities of lower octaves arouses an
oriental or Sufi type of devotion. It is distinctly a feminine or Astoreth scent.
Lavender has the effect of
"
fidelity, remembrance, patience, and sweetness
. . a staying quality." It has a rainbow effect of pale blue violet with touches of
rose which comes out in parallel lines with concentric circles.
Bergamot has a very elusive greenish blue or turquoise colour with a lower
chord of
"
more crimson lake than anything else ; rather like the spectrum, but it
has a line of strong yellow, crimson base, a greenish top, and a kind of bar of light
flashing out of the yellow in the middle

This interesting scent from the Citrus
Bergamia tree complements the Neroli scent.
Gum Animi, a crimson scent, would stir an emotional composer or poet,

Coumar/n and Tonquin Bean is fresh and bracing for a person fatigued ; its
effect is chiefly mental and etheric but pleasant on the astral, its colour is a greenish
yellow, astrally and mentally a rather sharp green, etherically a greyish green.
Cinnamon Oil is stimulating and works largely along astral lines arousing affec-
tion, sympathy, joyousness and good feeling through its maroon colour with almost
dark crimson flashes in it.
Mastic, a warm green, is etherically stimulating ; Thus works chiefly on the
etheric as a health-giver and cleanser.
Storax, an indigo colour, arouses a rather unintelligent devotion of the
militant type.

of Adyar incense in oil, we need not specially compound any incense.)
These potencies are in our hands to use at will. Just as the great Angels of
the Rays flash Their response to Their Altar Censing during the Eucharist, so will our
principles flash their response to these fragrant lovelinesses. We do not need
quantities of perfume for this purpose. If we rub lightly a common stone or shell with
our favourite essential oil, for weeks it will return to us an elusive scent of other-worlds.
HARMLESSNESS
ANNIE BESANT: "There is a Christian legend that as the Christ hung
dying in
agony on the Cross, He felt against His tortured right hand, pierced by

the cruel nail which held it to the wood, the soft rustle of tiny fluttering wings ; He
opened weary eyes and glanced, and there a little brown bird hovered, trying
with feeble bill to draw out the firm-fixed nail ; His life-blood had stained the tender
breast-feathers ; He smiled and blessed ; and, ever after, the crimson breast was
the mark of all the robin-race, and they became the Robin Red-Breasts, best-Joved-
of English birds.
"
Another legend of love of animal to a divine Man in sorrow, this time
Hindu : when Ramachandra cried aloud in anguish seeking His ravished wife, a
little squirrel of the woods ran up upon His breast, to tell what he had seen of
Ravana's flight; and Rama stroked it
tenderly with gentle hand, the tiny loving-
beast ; and all the squirrels since that day have worn the dainty stripes that the
divine fingers made in those caressing strokes.
"
In all
religions the love of the animal for the man, of the man for the animal,
has found due place and fit consecration. Go back as far as you will, and you will
find animals sanctified by divine contact on the steps by the divine throne. In Egypt
Apis manifested as Bull, Pasht as Cat. The Hindu honours the Bull of Mahadeva, the
Swan of Brahma, the lordly Eagle of Vishnu Among the Parsis Mithra had His Bull,
and the Chaldean Cannes had His Fish. Among the Christians a favourite symbol is
the Lamb, and what more loving and tender name is ascribed to Christ than that of
'
the good Shepherd
'
?
11
Everywhere we find the same idea ; and why ? In order that by the holiest
sanction religion could give, the animal might be encircled with the halo of divinity,
and a tie wrought between the Deity and the brute. Man is a thoughtless and a
hasty being, apt to tyrannize over the weak who serve him, apt to forget all he owes
to the strong and silent helpfulness of the animals he owns ; to recall that debt
wise men have lifted the animal into the radiance of the Divine, that the sacredness
given to a few might spread out over the animal world. Therefore is this worship so
widespread, and the love of the animal interwoven with the holiest feelings of
humanity, so that men and women of every creed might admit the righteousness of
the holy mission, when any came to voice the needs of the inarticulate, the suffering
that could only moan, not complain. If there be one thing more than another that
stirs the heart of every right-feeling man and woman, it is the suffering of the help-
less who cannot plead for themselves, the suffering of the child in humanity, of the
animal in the lower world. These are indeed fit objects of compassion, and those
who ignore the claims of the helpless need not hope to receive either justice or
mercy for themselves.
"
. . . Indians are naturally gentle and kindly, and treat animals well
. . . The men and the animals are friends, although masters and servants. The-
cattle, goats, sheep, donkeys, need no driving from place to place ;
they follow
their owners to the fields or back to the home. You see a peasant returning from
592 SYMBOLS AT WORK
labour with his bullocks behind him ; look at the eyes of the animals, and you will find
them untroubled and friendly. This harmonious relation of man and beast grows out
of religious feeling ; the Hindu believes in One Life, One Consciousness, in vegetable,
animal and man, so that the animal shares the Life that lives in the man. The Hindu
is taught to see God living in the animals round him . . . The cow is
regarded
as the mother, and is fed and tended as a religious duty . . ,
"
The results of indifference to animal-suffering are far-reaching.
The animal has a claim on every one of us for personal care and personal protection.
. . .
Every act of cruelty which we see and do not try to check forms part of
our destiny in days to come ; we share in the cruel action we do not hinder, and we
must share also in the inevitable reaction of pain to the doer. . . .
Every act
of cruelty which a man sees and does not seek to hinder falls into the mills of
God, and is
ground out as pain to himself. . . .
"
On the more evolved lies the burden of guiding evolution in his own
sphere, and society goes upward, or begins to descend in evolution as cruelty is, or
'\3 not, inflicted or tolerated. The qualities that distinguish man from the brute are
mercy, tenderness, gentleness, compassion. Human bodies are formed to express
these, and their nervous system is builded as an apparatus for this expression. It is
no excuse for human cruelty that the lion kills the stag, the cat the mouse, that
4
cruelty is in the scheme of nature.' It is not in our part of the scheme. Human
beings are higher than animals. . . . Where indifference to cruelty is found it
means the decay of society, its entrance on the downward grade , where acqui-
escence in cruelty is found under whatever name the cruelty may shelter itself that
society is decadent and has no future, unless it
changes its way ; the bodies born
into it will become coarser, generation after generation, until it has sunken into
savagery.
"
. . . It is ours to teach the animals with which we come into contact
they are future human beings- to develop their intelligence and train their faculties,
in the same spirit though on a lower level in which we train our children. You
are not brutal to your own children, though you call them yours. Oh I
be tender and
compassionate to these younger souls encased in animal bodies, and let your superior-
ity be the measure of your gentleness. Then shall the whole atmosphere of your
surroundings change, and cruelty, ill-treatment, indifference will give place to mercy,
gentleness and tenderness. Animals have their rights, and we have duties towards
them, for rights belong to the weak and duties to the strong.
"
Go forth, then, as knights, for the protection of the weak. . . . Take
tip as your personal duty the protection of every animal that comes in your way .
see to it that no avoidable suffering is inflicted upon any. So shall you deserve and
win that noblest of ail titles :
'
The friend of ail creatures.'

SAINT FRANCIS' SONG OF PRAISE
Most High, Omnipotent, Good Lord ! Honour, glory, and praise
And all blessings are Thine alone. To Thee a hymn I raise,
Though to utter even Thy name all are unfit always.
Praised be Thou, my Lord, for all that Thou for us hast made.
Praised be Thou for Brother Sun, who to dispel night's shade
Bringeth us the day and its light, so beautiful, so bright,
And whose splendour is
symbol of Thy glory to our sight.
Praise to Thee, my Lord, for the Moon, whom as Sister we greet,
And for the Stars with which Thou dost heaven's glory complete.
Praise to Thee, my Lord, for Brother Wind, and for Air and Cloud.
Praise to Thee, be sky serene, or tempest rage aloud,
Mid strife and calm, calm and strife, all
things are sustained in life.
Praise to Thee, my Lord, for Sister Water, humble, holy,
Rend'ring service, much prized, to all, e'en to the most lowly.
Praise to Thee, my Lord, for Brother Fire, so cheerful and bright,
So mighty, so strong, by whom Thou illuminest the night.
Praise to Thee, my Lord, for our Sister, dear Mother Earth,
Of all the protector, nourisher, and keeper from dearth,
Who to grass, and fruits, and flowers of divers hues, giveth birth
Praise to Thee,' O my Lord, for all who for Thy love's sake
Each other pardon, and of hardship and suffering partake.
Blessed are they who mid tribulation in peace are found.
For by Thee, most High, they shall with eternal joy be crowned.
Praise to Thee, my Lord, for Sister Death, claiming us all,
No man living escapeth her ; ail must obey her call.
Woe to them who die in mortal sin '
But they who are found
In accord with Thy will most holy, shall be blest and crowned ;
The second death shall not them harm, so will their joy abound
O praise ye and bless ye my Lord, and ever thankful be,
And serve ye Him with faithful hearts in great humility.

This Song of Praise, the greater part of which was first recited by Saint
Francis when he was ill at San Damiano, is sometimes called
"
The Song of the
Creatures/' inasmuch as Saint Francis in its verses gives voice to the praises ever
ascending from all creation to the Creator. Saint Francis himself calls it
"
The
Song of Brother Sun," and in its early lines recognizes the Sun as a source of light
and beauty, and as transcending in its splendour all other sacramental symbols of
the Divine Presence in the world.

Ye Heavens open, ye winds be still, and let the deathless circle of the Gods

HOMAGE TO OUR LORD THE SUN . THE SPLENDOUR OF ATON
The dawning is beautiful in the horizon of heaven,
O living Aton, Beginning of life !
When thou risest in the eastern horizon of heaven,
Thou fillest every land with thy beauty ;
For thou art beautiful, great, glittering, high over the earth ;
Thy rays, they encompass the lands, even all thou hast made
Thou art Re, and thou hast carried them all
away captive ;
Thou bindest them by thy love.
Though thou art afar, thy rays are on earth ;
Though thou art on high, thy footprints are the day.
Night
When thou settest in the western horizon of heaven .
The world is in darkness like the dead.
They sleep in their chambers,
Their heads are wrapt up,
Their nostrils stopped, and none seeth the other.
Stolen are all their things, that are under their heads,
While they know it not.
Every lion cometh forth from his den,
All serpents, they sting.
Darkness reigns,
The world is in silence,
He that made them has gone to rest in his horizon
[Thou makest darkness and it is night,
Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.
The young lions roar after their prey ,
They seek their meat from God -
Psalms, CIV, 20-21]
Day and Man
Bright is the earth,
When thou risest in the horizon,
When thou shinest as Aton by day.
The darkness is banished,
When thou sendest forth thy rays,
The Two Lands (Egypt) are in daily festivity,
Awake and standing upon their feet,
For thou hast raised them up.
Their limbs bathed, they take their clothing ;
Their arms uplifted in adoration to thy dawning.
Then in all the world, they do their work.
[The sun anseth, they get them away,
And lay them down in their dens.
Man goeth forth unto his work,
And to his labour until the evening. Psa/ms, CIV, 20-23]
Day and the Animals and Plants
All cattle rest upon their herbage,
All trees and plants flourish,
The birds flutter in their marshes,
598 SYMBOLS AT WORK
Their wings uplifted in adoration to thee.
Ail the sheep dance upon their feet,
All winged things fly,
They live when thou hast shone upon them.
Day and the Waters
The barques sail up-stream and down-stream alike.
Every highway is open because thou hast dawned.
The fish in the river leap up before thee,
And thy rays are in the midst of the great sea.
[Yonder is the sea, great and wide,
Wherein are things creeping innumerable
Both small and great beasts.
There go the ships ,
There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to sport with him. Psalms, CIV, 25-26]
Creation of Man
Thou art he who Greatest the man-child in woman,
Who makest seed in men,
Who giveth life to the son in the body of his mother,
Who soothest him that he may not weep,
A nurse (even) in the womb.
Who giveth breath to animate every one that he maketh,
When he cometh forth from the body,
. . . on the day of his birth,
Thou openest his mouth in
speech,
Thou suppliest his necessities.
Creation of Animals
When the chicklet crieth in the egg-shell,
Thou givest him breath therein, to preserve him alive.
When thou hast perfected him
That he may pierce the egg,
He cometh forth from the egg,
To chirp with all his might ;
He runnneth about upon his two feet,
When he hath come forth therefrom.
Ihe Whole Creation
How manifold are all
thy works !
They are hidden from before us,
O thou sole god, whose powers no other possesseth.

Thou didst create the earth according to thy desire.
While thou wast alone :
Men, all cattle large and small,
All that are upon the earth,
That go about upon their feet ;
All that are on high,
That fly with their wings.

"
O thou sole god, beside whom there is no other."

Their forms likewise and their skins,
For thou, divider, hast divided the peoples.
[O lord, how manifold are thy works '
In wisdom hast thou made them all ,
The earth is full of thy creatures. Psalms, CIV, 24]
Watering the Earth
Thou makest the Nile in the Nether World,
Thou bringest it at thy desire, to preserve the people alive.
O lord of them all, when feebleness is in them,
O lord of every house, who risest for them,
O sun of day, the fear of every distant land,
Thou makest (also) their life.
Thou hast set a Nile in heaven,
That it
may fall for them,
Making floods upon the mountains, like the great sea ;
And watering their fields among their towns.
How excellent are thy designs, O lord of eternity
I
The Nile in heaven is for the strangers,
And for the cattle of every land, that go upon their feet ;
But the Nile, it cometh from the nether world for Egypt.
Thus thy rays nourish every garden,
When thou risest they live, and grow by thee.
Jhe Seasons
Thou makest the seasons, in order to create all thy works ;
Winter bringing them coolness,
And the heat (of summer likewise).
Thou hast made the distant heaven to rise therein,
In order to behold all that thou didst make,
While thou wast alone,
Rising in thy form as living Aton,
Dawning, shining afar off and returning.
Beauty due to Light
Thou makest the beauty of form, through thyself alone.
Cities, towns and settlements,

All eyes see thee before them,
For thou art Aton of the day over the earth.
Revelation to the King
Thou art in my heart,
There is no other that knoweth thee,

Save thy Son Ikhnaton.
Thou hast made him wise in thy designs
And in thy might.
Even as thou hast made them.
When thou hast risen, they live ;
When thou settest, they die.
For thou art duration, beyond thy mere limbs,
By thee man liveth,
And their eyes look upon thy beauty,
Until thou settest.
All labour is laid aside,
When thou settest in the west ,
When thou risest, they are made to grow
for the king
Since thou didst establish the earth,
Thou hast raised them up for thy son,
Who came forth from thy limbs,
The king, living in truth,
The lord of the Two Lands, Neferkhepru-Re, Wan-Re,
The son of Re, living in truth, lord of diadems,
Ikhnaton, whose life is
long ;
(And for) the great royal wife, his beloved,
Mistress of the Two Lands, Nefernefru-aton, Nofretete,
Living and flourishing for ever and ever.
J. H Breasted, A History of Egypt, pp. 371-75, 761.
Ikhnaton deserted Thebes and the worship of Amon, the Sun-God,
and set up his Court at Tell-el-Amarna, on the other side of the Nile, and there
he established the religion of Aton, the power manifested in the Sun, from
which he took his name. As a religious reformer Ikhnaton temporarily destroyed
the worship of Amon he accounted it sinful to shed blood and to take life ,
he "
promoted the idea of universal brotherhood and conceived of a beautiful
world pervaded by universal peace." (Donald Mackenzie in Egyptian Myth
and Legend.) Aton was the First Cause manifested by the Sun, from which
all
things came, and from which ever issued forth the life-giving and life-sustaining
influence symbolized by rays ending in hands that support and nourish human
beings. Professor Flinders Petrie says :
"
No such grand theology had ever appeared
in the world before, so far as we know, and it is the forerunner of the later
monotheist religions, while it is ever more abstract and impersonal, and may well rank
as scientific theism. ... If this were a new religion, invented to satisfy our modern
scientific conceptions we could not find a flaw in the correctness of its view of the
energy of the solar system. ... No rag of superstition or of falsity can be found
clinging to this new worship evolved out of the old Aton of Heliopolis." The finest
surviving version of this great hymn was found in the tomb of a royal official at

the end of a cycle. He is
smoky cloud, of yellow hue, of various forms and without
any colour. He is of a distorted figure, [crucified or maimed as sacrifice ?] the giver
of forms, and is white-hued. He is of all colours, the great yogin, the sacrificer.

names of the Lord (Maha) Vishnu destructive of all sins. By reading them a

riches, and a Shudra is endued with reverential faith in Vishnu." Garuda Purana

"

judges, not by
what is now, but by a fore-ordained future towards which the individual and the

Above is a list of the stones peculiar to the seven Rays. It must not be

respective Rays in the mineral kingdom, and so are their most appropriate represent-
atives. Why they are so, we do not yet know ; it is apparently not on account of
their chemical constitution, for in that respect the sapphire and the ruby are practic-
ally identical, yet the forces flowing through them are radically different. Possibly
the colour

of the stone may be an important factor. Further investigation will no
doubt in time clear up these points ; in the meantime, our Priests may depend

of some stones of less value, which may be substituted when those in the first
column are unobtainable ; but the stones of this second list would need to be larger
in size if
they are to be equally effective." Jhe Science of the Sacraments
JEWELS IN HINDU AND OTHER TRADITIONS
Garuda Parana, Chapter LXVIII et seq , is
literally a mine of information about
precious stones. The story is told of a valiant demon, Vala, who conquered the
god Indra and the celestials. Vala was finally bested by a trick and gave up
his body on the altar of sacrifice.
"
Thus Vala yielded up his ghost for the
good of the universe and the welfare of the gods, and behold, the severed
limbs and members of his sanctified body were converted into the seeds
of gems."
Diamond. From his bone came the Diamond, one of the greatest of
treasures to the Ruler, though certain colours of diamonds were appropriate to each
caste. It was thought better that women should not wear diamonds "
as they pos-
sessed the mystic virtue of making them sterile and unhappy ... A king wearing
a diamond dazzling with lightning flashes is sure to subdue the prowess of his neigh-
bouring monarchs and to exercise an unbounded control upon his vassals and
liege subjects."
Ancient medieval lore also lists the diamond as precious above all other
natural bodies, Paracelsus stating that the power of the diamond was so fatal that
no remedy could correct its venom. India links it with Venus, the white lotus, the
east and the Pea of Delichos.
Pearl. From the teeth of Vala came the Pearl, which protects from evil
influence. The western ancients believed that the pearl especially fortified a
mother's heart and helped her to nourish her young. The pearl is believed in India
to be sacred to the Moon, in the West to Venus.
/$ this one of the unknown jewels ? Garuda Purana tells of a
"
cloud-
grown pearl which rarely reaches this mortal globe . . .
Outshining the
combined effulgence of the fire, the moon, and the myriads of scintillating stars,
such a pearl, like the dawn of day, can dispel the gloom of even the darkest night
on earth. The whole earth, girdled by the four oceans containing innumerable
gems in their fathomless depths, cannot be deemed as the adequate price of such
a pearl, even if she be covered over with layers of pure gold. A man, born in
indigence and of humble parents, but happening to be the possessor of such a
pearl, ... is sure to be the paramount sovereign of the entire surface of the
Earth . . . and no evil would ever strike the land to the extent of a thousand
Yojanas round the place of his birth."
Ruby. From the blood of the demon was born the Ruby seed, which by the
"
effulgence of its own stirring and sterling properties
"
protects a man from even
JEWELS 605
deadly enemies. It was also believed by both East and West to protect from
disease or plague. The medieval tradition is that the ruby changed colour and
became obscured when danger threatened, recovering its brilliancy when the peril
passed away. India linked it with the ruby-sun, the red lotus and wheat, placing its
direction in the centre.
Emerald. From the bile of Vala was born the Emerald. It is
significant in
view of the correlation of the emerald to the Sea of the Circle that Garuda Parana
says :
"
The wise and the intelligent should wear an emerald set in gold at the time
of religious ablution, or of rinsing the mouth with water on the occasion of a religious
sacrifice, or during the performance of protective incantations, or at the time of
making gifts of cows and gold, or during the performance of obsequious rites done
unto the gods and one's departed ancestors, or for the cure of diseases, brought
about by the deranged condition of the vital winds, or incidental to the effects of
poison. . ."
The Hindu almanac links the emerald with Mercury, the white Malabar Glory
lily, the lentil pulse and the north-east direction
The alchemists of the middle ages wore an emerald with a scarabaeus thereon
carved as a certain remedy against all poison, also for the purpose of obtaining
favours. It had a calming effect upon the tempests
Sapphire From the eyes of the lord of the demons, which resembled the
full-blown blue lilies, were born the Sapphires about which "
learned men, wise in the
wisdom of the Shastras, are loud in ... praise."
In the West it was sacred to Apollo, gave courage, had power to reconcile
people at strife, kept its wearers from falling into the ambuscades of enemies, and
preserved its wearers from madness and the bleeding heart that cometh of anguish.
It
lightened the body and preserved the limbs.
In India it is considered sacred to Saturn and is linked with the blue lotus or
water lily,
sesamum and the west.
Lapis Lazuli. From the thundering war-cry of the lord of the demons, when
the bosom of the primordial ocean was violently agitated, there came forth a
formation of packs of sable clouds and Lapis Lazuli were formed under their
influence, as of so many effulgent shootings off from that primordial sky.
In India this is linked with Rahu, the ascending Node of the Moon, as also
with the coral tree, thorn apple, mandara, black gram and the south-west.
Topaz. From the skin of Vala's body came the Topaz whose virtue consists
in removing the sterility of a woman and in crowning her with the glory of maternity.
It is linked with Jupiter, jasmine, Bengal gram and the north in the Indian
pantheon.
In the West it was considered to have calming and sedative influence, and
especially a good effect against melancholy, evil thoughts and bad dreams.
606 SYMBOLS AT WORIC
Is this the Opal ? From the nails
'
of the deceased Vala,
"
scattered by the
wind in the lovely tufts of the lotus plants, were transformed . . . the seeds
of the gems known as the Karketanam [Opal ?], the most prized of all gems in
the world.
"
A Karketanam is usually found to be possessed of a hue like the colours
of honey, blood and the moonbeam blended together, and shines with a peculiar
dazzling effulgence of a yellowish copper-tinged shade. A Karketanam which is
blue or white or lustreless should be looked upon as of inferior quality."
The very best of these stones without cracks, fissures, etc., due to a deranged
. . .
process of crystallization in the course of their growth, should be looked
upon
"
as extremely rare and the holiest of the holies."
"
A Karketanam, set in an article or an ornament of gold, and appearing as
if glowing with the blaze of a living fire, acts as the greatest known panacea, and
should be regarded as endued with the mystic virtue of increasing the progeny and
duration of life of its wearer, and of bringing happiness to his household by destroy-
ing the evil propensities of his mind. . . . Men who use such a Karketanam
gem of high and wonderful virtues . . . are sure to be the masters of untold
wealth, and are glorified in the world and enjoy universal fame and perpetual felicity
amidst the unsolicited affections of many a true, tested and devoted friend, ..."
In the West the opal partaking of the colour of every other gem, was
supposed to possess all their virtues. In its presence the witch muttered her
incantations in vain ... it enabled the wearer to walk safely in the midst of
pestilence and venom.
Is this Stone perhaps the Unknown Gem of the Point ? From the seeds of
the lord cast into a country situate north of the Himalayas was born the Bhishma-
stone
"
of a white colour like that of a conch-shell and resplendent like a ray of the
unclouded sun, while the one of a comparatively later origin is sometimes mistaken
for a diamond.
"
The man who devoutly wears a pure Bhishma-stone set in gold about his
neck perpetually meets with the good in life, all fierce beasts flee him, the
libations he offers to the dead give satisfaction for years to come, poisons readily
yield to him, he is immune to the dangers of water and fire alike, and thieves dare
not intrude upon the precincts of his house."
Pu/aJcas, another unknown stone, probably a type of jasper or agate from
description, were also born of the nails of the demon, and are deemed to grant
increase of wealth and progeny to the wearers.

The Agate in the West was highly esteemed for the power to avert
accidents, calm tempests and stay violence. The Jacinth or ladnth also took the
same line as the agate, of calming, soothing, and increasing mirth.

Gold was considered as the first production of the sacred element Fire.
On the Aqua Marine, sea captains carved Neptune for safety.
The Sardonyx rendered men discreet in valour. The Cornelian had power
o reconcile people at strife. The Beryl incited courage even in the timid. The
Amber was supposed to be a natural protective for young children, The Carbuncle
was a singular protection against plague.
The Bloodstone, sacred in the West to Mars, in the East was regarded as
being the outcome of the complexion of the lord of the demons and was deemed
to be, like the sapphire, wealth-increasing.
The Cora/, which came forth from the entrails of the lord of the demons, was
another stone of good fortune, judged as sacred to Mars, the Jackbread tree, the
dal (gram), and southern direction
The Crystal which arose from the fat of the demon king was judged as being
the highest stone to absolve man from sin.
The Amethyst, not specifically mentioned in Garuda Purana, was a stone much
valued in the West, as that of Bacchus, and as having power ever the elements.
While much superstition came to be attached to these various sacred jewels,
undoubtedly the story of Vala is an allegory of esoteric significance, had one its key.
KALI YUGA
"
Once on a time the sages assembled and discussed at what season the
least morality obtained the greatest reward, and by whom it was most easily
displayed. In order to terminate the discussion they went to Veda Vyasa
to remove their doubts . . .
Being thus accosted by the ascetics, Vyasa
smiled and said to them . . .
'
The fruit of penance, of continence, of
silent prayer, and the like, practised in the Krita age for ten years, in
the Treta for one year, in the Dvapara for a month, is obtained in the Kali
age in a day and night ; therefore I did say :
"
Excellent, excellent is the Kali
age." The reward which a man obtains in the Krita age by abstract meditation, in
the Treta by sacrifice, in the Dvapara by adoration, he receives in the Kali Yuga by
merely reciting the names of Keshava. O pious and great ascetics, in the Kali age,
by very little exertion men attain to exalted virtue, and it is for this reason I
speak
highly of the Kali Yuga ... in the Krita and other ages great were the toils of the
regenerate to perform their duty.' [Said Parasara] I have also communicated to
you, O excellent Maitreya, the secret this one great virtue of the otherwise
vicious Kali age." Vishnupuranam, Part VI, Section 2

LINE
VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL
Vertical Polarization : A special puja performed by those devoted to Shiva is
to maintain a perpendicular position of the torso for twenty-four hours on the day
of His great tapas, Mahashivaratri. Even the ordinary householder worships Shiva in
His tapas by thus refraining on this one day from placing his body in contact with
the horizontal currents of Mother Earth.
This same discipline is an occasional practice observed by the Buddhist
bhikku ; the younger among the brethren for one to three nights in a month, the
elder for a week, and the most holy whose temperament attracts them to this
discipline spend decades of their lives, entirely in the perpendicular, thus polarizing
their bodies to the North and South heavenly currents rather than to the East and
West mother currents. This does not mean sleeplessness, for the body adjusts itself
to the new regime, only the very young monks needing to wear the breast strap to
maintain the upright position of torso in sleep.
In the Northern Buddhist Dorje or Sceptre Posture, the spinal column is
visualized as a pile of metallic coins one above the other.

FROM LINE TO CIRCLE
The Ankh-Tie. The Secret Doctrine, quoting from Gerald Massey's The Natural
Genesis, which Madame Blavatsky said contained "
more information ... on the
cross and circle than any other work we know of,
"
:
" The wheel emblem unites
the cross and circle in one, as does the hieroglyphic cake and the Ankh-tie
LINE 609
This Ankh-tie is
compared with the
"
Pasha, a cord which the four-armed
Shiva holds in the hand of his right back arm . . . The Pasha is held in the hand
in such a way that the first finger and hand near the thumb make the cross, or loop
and crossing."
Though this symbol is so vividly depictive of early embryological development
(see the Symbols through the Kingdoms) The Secret Doctrine states : "As an
emblem of
'
door, gate, mouth, the place of outlet
'
it
signifies the '
strait gate
'
that leads to the Kingdom of Heaven, far more than the
'
birthplace
'
in a
physiological sense.
"
It is a cross in a circle and Crux Ansata truly ; but it is a cross on which all
the human passions have to be crucified before the Yogi passes through the '
strait
gate,' the narrow circle that widens into an infinite one, as soon as the Inner Man
has passed the threshold." II. 576 (Adyar ed., IV, 116 et seq.)
The Serpent swallowing his Jail. Before the inner vision of Kekule, who had
been vainly trying through the theory of the Chain or Line formation to solve the
problem of the union of certain chemical elements of equal valency, there flashed
the picture of the Linear Serpent swallowing his tail. He saw the answer at once,
set up his theory of close or circular formation which opened up the field of
Aromatic Chemistry, now one of the most important branches of the Science.
In The Secret Doctrine, attention is also called to this very old symbol of the
Linear Serpent becoming the circle through swallowing his tail, a symbol which is to
be found in the Seal of The Theosophical Society. The "first and earliest cross and
circle
"
was so formed, and is described in Bhagavata Parana :
"
At the extremity of the tail of that animal, whose head is directed toward
the south" note the vertical orientation "and whose body is in the shape of a
ring [circle],
Dhruva [the ex-pole star] is
placed ;
along its tail are Prajapati, Agni,
Indra, Dharma, etc. ; across its loins, the seven Rishis." [The placing of the oldest of
the Deities on the perpendicular Line is
significant.]
The Cat Posture. The Line of the body was rolled into the Circular form in
certain types of meditation :
"
'Deus en/m et circulus est,' says Pherecydes, in his Hymn to Jupiter. This
was a Hermetic axiom, and Pythagoras prescribed such a circular prostration and
posture during the hours of contemplation.
'
The devotee must approach as much
as possible the form of a perfect circle,' prescribes the Secret Book . . . and Pliny
says :
'
During our worship, we roll up, so to say, our body in a ring- -totum corpus
circumagimur.'
"
The Secret Doctrine also says that
"
one of the mystic reasons
"
why a cat
was held sacred was "
because of its body being rolled up in a circle when asleep.
The posture is prescribed for occult and magnetic purposes, in order to regulate, in

a certain way, the circulation of the vital fluid, with which the cat is preeminently
endowed. '
The nine lives of a cat

is a popular saying based on good physiolog-
ical and occult reasons." II, 576 (Adyar ed., IV, p. 116 et seg.)
LOTUS '

Every Temple has its Lotus pool for the Lotus has always been the symbol
of a true priest. Though its roots grow in the mud beneath the water, it
opens in
the sunlight, and through its stalk the root knows of what the flower has seen
"
Mankind between birth and death knows of the earth body : and that is
the roots of the Lotus. All leave their bodies when they sleep, but few there are
whose memory of what they do away from earth is not washed away by the waters
of Forgetfulness. Some go to the places from whence the Light shines but only
those who have a channel of memory, which is the stalk of the Lotus, can bring-
back to Earth what they have seen in the Light." Joan Grant, Winged Pharaoh
"
The Lotus is the product of heat (fire) and water (vapour or ether) ;
fire
standing ... as a representation of the Spirit of Deity, the active, male,
generative principle ; and ether, or the soul of matter, the light of the fire, for the
passive female principle, from which everything in this Universe emanated. Hence
ether or water is the Mother, and fire is the Father." ,

6. I adore in my head the two Lotus Feet of the Guru. The jewelled

only attainable by
great labour in the Wandering (Sangsara)." Arthur Avalon, Jhe Serpent Power
In the Commentary written by Shrikalicharana on Verse 6, are quoted other
lymns of praise to the Lotus Flower.
The Purashcharana-rasollasa has the following dialogue :
"
Shri Mahadeva said :
'
There in the pericarp of the wonderful everlasting
.otus of a thousand petals meditate always on your own Guru.' Shri Parvati said :
The head of the Great Lotus of a thousand petals, O Lord, is always downward
urned ;
then say, O Deva, how can the Guru constantly dwell there ?
'
Shri
Mahadeva said :
'
Well hast thou asked, O Beloved. Now listen whilst I
speak to Thee,
"he great Lotus Sahasrara has a thousand petals, and is the abode of Sadashiva and
s full of eternal bliss. It is full of all kinds of delightful fragrance, and is the place
>f
spontaneous bliss. The head of this Lotus is
always downward, but its pericarp is
ilways upward, and united with Him is Kundalini in the form of a triangle.'
"
The Kangka/a-Ma/n/ says :
"
Meditate on the excellent Antaratma in the
.otus of a thousand petals, and on the shining throne which is between Nada and
Jindu, and on it
(the throne) meditate constantly upon your own Guru, who is like a
fountain of Silver."
The Yama/a says :
"
Meditate (on your Guru) in the Lotus of a thousand

ip to grant boons and to dispel fear."

by the Greek and Latin Churches, who made .of it a messenger, as do now the
Christians, who have replaced it with the water-lily.'
"
The importance and significance of the Lotus, in the eyes of our revered
founder, Madame Blavatsky, may be understood by the following quotations from
The Secret Doctrine :
" '
The Lotus plant exists not only as a miniature embryo in its seed (a phys-
ical characteristic), but its prototype is
present in an ideal form in the astral light
from "
dawn
"
to
"
night
"
during the manvantaric period.'
"
In speaking of a reference given to the Fourth Race
'
Flower of Power,' in
the Stanzas of Dzyan, she says :
'
The Flower of Power is now the Lotus ; what it
may have been at that period, who can tell ?
'
"This is borne out by Dr. Besant and Bishop Leadbeater, who from their
earliest observations revealed to us the marvellous fact that the invisible
meditation form, created by meditation on divine self-sacrifice, was the half-opened
Lotus bud ; that our force-centres of the body take the form of Lotus blossoms ;
while the whole solar system seen with inner vision is a Lotus flower.
"
Many concepts have been given to man's mind and heart through the Lotus
symbol. The following are some mentioned in Jhe Secret Doctrine :
"
Trie Lotus Seed. .
'
The seeds of the Lotus, even before they germinate,
contain perfectly-formed leaves, the miniature shapes of what they will become one
day, as perfected plants . . . which typifies the fact that the spiritual proto-
types of all
things exist in the immaterial world before these things become material-
ized on earth
'
true symbol of evolution.
"
Jhe Growing Lotus.
'
The Lotus plant grows up through the water, having
its root in the ilus, or mud, and spreading its flower in the air above. The Lotus
thus typifies the life of man and also that of the Cosmos ; for the Secret Doctrine
teaches that the elements of both are the same, and that both are developing in
the same direction. The root of the Lotus sunk in the mud represents material life,
the stalk passing up through the water typifies existence in the astral world, and the
flower, floating on the water and opening to the sky, is emblematical of spiritual being.'
Thus the growing Lotus has long been a symbol of man's life in the three worlds.
"
The Lotus Plant.
'
The Hindu trimurti or trinity ... in the world of
Jdeas, . . .
Creation, Preservation and Destruction, or Brahma, Vishnu and
Shiva ; in the world of matter. . . .
Earth, Water and Fire, or the Sun, (is)
symbolized by the Lotus, a flower that lives by earth, water, and the sun. The
Lotus, sacred to Isis, had the same significance in Egypt, whereas in the Christian
symbol, the Lotus, not being found in either Judea or Europe, was replaced by the
water-lily.'
"
The Lotus Flower.
'
The Lotus flower, carried in the hands of an angel or a
god, has always meant the idea of Duality or Creation and Generation. In the
LOTUS 615
Christian religion, in
every picture of the Annunciation, Gabriel, the Archangel,
.appears to the Virgin Mary, holding in his hand a spray of water-lilies. This
.spray typifying Fire and Water, or the idea of Creation and Generation, sym-
bolizes precisley the same idea as the Lotus in the hand of the Bodhisattva
who announces to Maha-Maya, Gautama's mother, the birth of Buddha, a
World Saviour. Thus also were Osiris and Horus constantly represented by the
Egyptians in association with the Lotus flower, both being Sun-Gods or Gods
of Fire.'
"
Another quotation as to this duality :
" '
One of the symbolical figures for the Dual Creative Power in Nature
(matter and force on the material plane) is Padma, the water-lily of heat (Fire) and
Water (vapour or Ether) : Fire standing in every philosophical and religious system,
even in Christianity, as a representation of the Spirit of Deity, the active generative
principle ; and Ether, or the soul of matter, the light of the Fire, for the passive
principle from which everything in this universe emanated. Hence, Ether or Water
is the Mother, and Fire is the Father.'
"
As a symbol of duality, surely, then we can understand why
'
He who ever
incarnates when faith begins to die out in the world. . . .
Padmapani, the
Avatara/ representative of the Divine Second Logos, is
pictured and called
'
He
who holds a white Lotus,'
'
Saviour of the world,' or simply
'
The Lotus Bearer,' for
He bears back to a world without faith the Divine Dual Christ Principle
'
The Lotus
Flower
'
(for whether this Christ Force works in our aspirations of self-sacrifice,
or the Chakras or centres of our bodies, it builds for itself a form to work in a
Lotus flower).
"
But back of these many relatively exoteric lessons taught through our
Fifth Race '
Flower of Power/ is that underlying esoteric principle of which the
Lotus is a true symbol. For we are told that the Lotus is
represented as growing
out of Vishnu's navel, and on the green pads of which Brahma sits in meditation to
create a Universe. In those ancient Stanzas of Dzyan, the world's oldest scriptures,
the Lotus is the symbol of the divine Idea of manifestation in the mind of the
Logos, in the seed of which is the perfect form of a universe as yet unborn. It is
the symbol of the divine Ideal of a universe in the heart of God, our Father, before
as yet the creative Logoi had seen within it
archetypal forms to copy in the
building and fashioning of a manifested universe. The Perfect Universe, the Lotus,
existed within the Logos' consciousness before even the beginnings of the coming
forth into actual, tangible manifestation. It is the symbol of cosmic creation, cosmic
birth. True then is the sight of those who, with inner vision awakened, have seen
our solar system as a Lotus flower.
"
Its jewel is Man, or God, and when one chants :
'
Oh, the Jewel in the
Lotus/ one says the age-old prayer :
'
Oh, the God within me.'
616 SYMBOLS AT WORK
As this divine and perfect form in God's consciousness becomes the
cosmic womb of the manifested universe, the correlation is thus clear as to why in
ancient Egypt
'
the goddess Hiquit, in the form of the amphibious toad enshrined
in a Lotus flower,' is the symbol of resurrection or rebirth, this symbol enduring
until early Christian time when it was engraved on the church lamps with the simple
words,
'
I am the resurrection.'
"
As the Lotus in its most ancient meaning symbolized birth, most fitting it is
from this standpoint that the day chosen for us to celebrate the passing from us of
the objective form of our Founders, should have been called by Madame Blavatsky
'
White Lotus Day/ for she herself writes :
'
Whether as the Lotus or water-lily it
signifies one and the same philosophical idea ;
namely, the Emanation of the
Objective from the Subjective, Divine Ideation, passing from the abstract into the
concrete, or visible form.' Thus she gave to those who grieved for her passing
the promise of her future objective work in the world, her rebirth, in this symbol of
resurrection the white Lotus." --A. H. Peterson, World Jheosophy, May 1932
MAN
ANNIE BESANT : Man is that being in the Universe in which Highest Spirit
and lowest matter meet in Mind or Intelligence.
"
Such Units are called technically Monads [Selves]. These are the Sons,
abiding from everlasting, from the beginning of a creative age, in the Bosom of the

truly
'
equal to the Father as touching his Godhead, but inferior to the Father as
touching his manhood
'
[Athanasian Creed], and each of them is to go forth into
matter in order to render all
things subject to himself ; he is to be '
sown in weak-
ness
'
; that he may be '
raised in power
'
; from a static Logos enfolding all divine
potentialities, he is to become a dynamic Logos unfolding ail divine powers ;
omni-
scient, omnipresent, on his own second plane, but unconscious,
'
senseless,' on all
others, he is to veil his glory in matter that blinds him, in order that he may become
omniscient, omnipresent, on all planes, able to answer to all divine vibrations in the
universe instead of to those on the highest only."
"
Yet is the Monad very near to us, our SELF, the very root of our being,
the innermost source of our life, the one Reality."
"
This spiritual Triad, as it is often called, Atma-Buddhi-Manas, [Will, Wisdom-
Love, Activity] is described as a seed, a germ of divine life containing the potential-
ities of its own heavenly Father, its Monad, to be unfolded into powers in the course
of evolution. This is the

inferior, semi-intelligent and non-intelligent Elementals are all future men. The fact

MOTHERHOOD
THE GRAIL OF MOTHERHOOD
"
Even more glorious than the sacred offices of King, Priest and Teacher is the
priesthood of every woman without exception --priest of the Motherhood of God,
and of the Love of God in mysterious exaltation. This Motherhood may be a
Motherhood in pure Will, or it
may be a Motherhood in pure Wisdom, or it
may be
a Motherhood in Creative Activity. Ever is it the heart of Life and the Holy Grail of
all noble virtues. Hear the words of the mighty Lawgiver of the Aryan Race, Him
whom Hindus call Lord Vaivasvata the Manu :
" '
Where women are honoured, the gods rejoice. Where they are not
honoured, the family perishes. The teacher of the higher knowledge exceedeth ten
teachers of the lower knowledge in the title to respect ; the father exceedeth him
a hundred times ; but the mother exceedeth the father a thousand times in the
weighty virtue of teacher, and in the right to reverence. The order of the house-
holder supports all other orders, even as the air supports all
living things, and the
mother is the heart of the household/
"
In every religion throughout the world God incarnating as Mother shines no
Jess gloriously than God incarnating as Father, or as Son, or as the very Fire of Life,
the Holy G-host. God the Creator, God the Sustainer, God the Regenerator in all
three dwells God the Mother as heart of each.

Activity is expressed through Brahma and his Shakti Sarasvati.
The principle of God the Sustainer and Preserver finds its expression in Hinduism through
Vishnu-Lakshmi, and in Buddhism we find "the dual Bodhisattva, whose male form is Kwan-shi-ym,
the Lord Maitreya, and whose female form is
Kwan-ym, the mysterious companion and shakti of
the former in almost all religions." (Vide Talks on the Path of Occultism, by C. W. Leadbeater,
page 579.)
God the Regenerator is worshipped in Hinduism as Shiva whose Shakti Parvatl Power as
Protection is adored as World Mother.
This Man-Woman duality of each principle is apart from the consideration of the First
Principle itself as Man-Woman with an emphasis on Man, the Third Aspect as Woman-Man, with an
emphasis on Woman, and the Second Aspect as blending the two in perfect balance. (Vide

consecrated to a sacrifice. She is a bright shadow of God the Mother, and about
the sacred acts of her ministering, of the exercise of her priesthood, hovers in sure
benediction the Queen of Motherhood herself. . . .
"
Alas that this supreme priesthood is remembered in no consecration, though
the sacred Acts of Motherhood, or their spirit in those who bear no physical children,
are living homage to God the Mother. . . .
41
Each year should be marked by a great Festival of Motherhood, of the
Motherhood of the individual, of the Motherhood of the State, and of
very Life herself And at an appropriate age every girl
citizen should
receive, at the hands of those who themselves have received it, some form
of outer consecration to the beautiful and spiritual mission of her sex. . . .
And the education of girls is education for Motherhood, be it actual physical
Motherhood or its spiritual complement. A woman may become a mother of
children ; but she certainly should be a mother to children, to all
young life, and to
unhappiness and need everywhere. A woman is a divinely appointed channel for
Motherhood to the world. She is the accredited representative of Motherhood
even in the very building of her physical body. And to the end of her life she
remains such representative and such channel, even though, in the ways so terribly
prevalent throughout the world, she may befoul and desecrate her channel, making
it almost, but never utterly, dry, even though she may dishonour her ambassadorship
from Life the Mother. Never does she lose all of her sacredness. Never is the
Fire in her of Motherhood irretrievably extinct. And if in her early years of woman-
hood we tend that Fire with reverence and wisdom, maybe it will burn in growing
brightness to spread far and wide the warmth of happiness and peace. . . . The
Spirit of Motherhood, in its wonderful glories, should brood over each girl from the
very beginning of her more conscious life in the outer world. . . .
"
How true it is that the world is heading towards disaster as its women forget
their dedication to the Spirit of Motherhood, whether physical or otherwise, to that
Spirit of Sacrifice which unveils the holiness of living, and to that Spirit of Aspiration
which adds the greatness of the Past to the nobility of the Present, that both may
find their consummation in the Glory of the Future. How true it is that the world
is
heading towards disaster as its men forget their dedication to that Spirit of
Chivalry which is reverence in active expression, to that Spirit of Service which
spreads contentment far and wide, and to that Spirit of Aspiration which plans upon
the foundations of the Present a Future of Happiness and Peace. . . .
14
The woman is the guardian of life's unbroken chain of growing from less to
more She is an ever-living holy grail for all that has made life noble and beautiful
in the past, that in her own pure living she may pour the fructifying waters of its
greatness upon the present, and yield unsullied to those who shall come after her
the holy cup of ideals and sacrifice.
MOTHERHOOD 621
"
Thus, in form of woman, a God moves steadily onwards to the goal which
knows both man and woman as one. There are not two Gods man and woman.
There is but one God, who becomes man today and woman tomorrow for quicker
movement to Divinity." - -Gods in the Becoming
"
So far as I am aware, in every great faith the Mother-Principle finds noble
and wonderful expression, perhaps as Power-Sacrifice, impersonal,
'
awful
'
in the
true sense of the word, or perhaps as Purity-Sacrifice, an ideal woman, such, for
example, as we have in Christianity in Our Lady.
"
In terms of Nirvana I seem to perceive a Mother-Light and a Father-Light,
each a component part of the Lightning-standing-still. . . . The Mother-Light
impresses me first of all with a sense of ... Restraint, reserved Power, Refuge,
Protection. I seem to see within the glorious embodiments in the outer world of
this great Mother-Light a radiant sea of Light, and the image comes to me of a vast
expanse of still and silent ocean . . .
glittering in the soft light of the full moon, the
slight ripples causing a ceaseless shimmering. Think what the ocean is. Remember
its tremendous, irresistible power. But this ocean of the Mother-Light is never
lashed into storm ;
it remains ever peaceful, ever calm, inscrutable, deep beyond
the power of words to express, yet shimmering, scintillating, with that Love-Light
which is a mighty mountain peak of Wisdom-Compassion.
"
In this great sea of Mother-Light lives every woman in the world, in all
worlds. Its Light permeates her and its sea upholds her, so that she rests upon it, is
enfolded in it. How calm is this sea of Light, how utterly safe, how wondrously about
every woman in all worlds !
Every woman is one with this mighty sea, is indeed a
holy and consecrated channel through which it flows outwards to generate and to
fructify all life : Mater Generatrix. As broods the Mother-Light over every act of
renewal in every kingdom of Nature, so should every woman know herself to be the
priestess of this Light Divine to every kingdom of Nature. What a mission '
How
splendid an office ! Woman the Fire of Creation.
"
At this point let me for a moment place in juxtaposition the Father-Light.
What do I
perceive . . . ? Action, a flashing-forth, may I
say a storm-ridden sea,
pulsating with mighty outpourings ? The Positive complementary to the Negative ;
the two mighty Poles of manifested Being. Entering the essence of these two
great Lights I see the One ... a More-than-Light. ... But I realize how both Father-
Light and Mother-Light must together express this More-than-Light as it assumes
the shadow of manifestation. . . . How long shall it be before the body of the
little child is in very truth the sacred consummation of blended Mother-Light and
Father-Light, dedicated to noble purposes because conceived in holy aspiration ?
"
. . . | have been abiding awhile in the Real, and I have been living in
the intense yearning of the World-Mother that Her children may draw nearer to
Her, so that She may press them to Her Heart. Where there is sorrow, grief,
622 SYMBOLS AT WORK
despair, agony, there is the World-Mother, tending, cherishing, comforting, as many
a pain-stricken mother knows, as many a lonely child knows, too. Yet She could do
so much more, would womanhood but turn to Her. . . . Downward shines the
Mother-Light through every World-Mother this earth has ever known. Once again
do They come near to the world which aforetime They have mothered. Once
more They stir in the heart of every woman, summoning her to light again the
sacrificial Fire in the temple of her being. . . .
"
Each faith has its Power, its Wisdom and its Love. Within all three lies
enshrined Motherhood directing the Power, enlightening the Wisdom, beautify-
ing the Love
"
How wonderful is the Motherhood of God, the Mother-Principle of Life
. . . a glowing Glory, a glowing Triumph, a glowing Tenderness, a glowing
Sacrifice, a glowing Understanding, a glowing Power to guard and cherish. The Light
which is this Mother-Principle flashes forth many-hued, encircling the world, radiating
upon all things In every kingdom of Nature shines this perfect Light. Upon every
act of creation it rests in priceless benediction Of this Light Our Lady, this
Universal Mother of us all, is the Epiphany, the embodied Form. She is a Being, a
Person, who has trodden this glorious road to Divinity, and has reached at-one-ment
in Motherhood. . . . She is no abstraction, no pure Principle, but Mother-Light
in glorious Form. By the side of every mother does She stand as the mother bears
splendid witness in her own physical body that she is a Temple of the Living God,
and that in her this Sacrifice is mirrored anew for the wonder of this world. It is
Our Lady who is the High Priestess in this holy sacrifice. It is Our Lady who
touches the agony and makes it
joy, who offers the sacrifice and makes
it bliss.
"
Each mother-to-be is a Temple made ready for Our Lady. Never does She
fail to come when the offering is
upon the altar, an image of God to be sent forth
into the world on a further journey in the Great Quest. And even beforehand
come Angels of Her Presence, ministering, comforting, encouraging, glorifying. Can
you perceive from this great sacrament of birth, how great indeed, how solemn, is
the sacrament that precedes it, the sacrament of marriage ? Over every marriage,
truly, broods Our Lady's Blessing. The married couple become Her children, united
for that beautiful sacrifice of birth-giving which they prepare in shining love for
offering by Our Lady. As in the Bread and Wine of the Eucharistic Service is the
Real Presence of our Lord, so in every child-birth is the Real Presence of Our Lady.
How glorious the role of woman temple, priestess, altar, chalice in one ! . . .
May every man bow in reverence before Her temples, may every woman cause Her
light to shine upon the world. So shall the Mother-Light heal the wounds of the
world, and make it new." Nirvana

MOUNTAINEERING
"
Mountaineering is a search for beauty. There is
beauty all about us, and the
more we develop our vision, the more do we perceive Beauty is as necessary to
a man as food and drink. Spiritually he cannot exist without it
"
The force that drives man towards the summits of the highest hills is the
same force that has raised him above the beasts He is not put into this world
merely to exist ,
he is put there to find love and happiness, to express and to
create. . . . The highest hills demand the best that is within man, and some-
thing more. They are gifts, but not gifts to be lightly given. They demand not
only a striving but a purpose. To climb on them, whether successfully or unsuccess-
fully, is to put yourself in phase with the supreme forces of the universe.
"
Another thing that my own experiences on the highest hills have made me
realize very forcibly is the wrongness of an approach in a conquering spirit . . .
the highest hills have taught me that a man cannot conquer Nature. Such a word
as
'
conquest
'
to express his relationship with Nature breathes of egotism and
smacks of a conscious superiority which in itself suggests a lack of affinity with
Nature. Nature is not a thing apart, something to be stormed and conquered, it
is a part of us, an all-prevailing beauty and magnificence in which we strive to
realize ourselves, and in realizing learn the true import of existence. To climb the
highest hills is to realize an akinship with Nature. . . .
"
The greatness of mountaineering on the highest hills lies in the fact that no
single man is capable of reaching a summit by his own efforts. It is this that
segregates the greatest peaks of the world from peaks of lesser altitude as mental
and physical problems."

THE KUNG OR TONE OF MANIFESTED NATURE
"
Hast thou attuned thy heart and mind to the great mind and heart of all
mankind ? For as the sacred river's roaring voice whereby all nature-sounds are
echoed back, so must the heart of him who in the stream would enter thrill in re-
sponse to every sigh and thought of all that lives and breathes
"
The Voice of the Silence, p. 72
Commenting on the above, H. P. B. wrote :
"
The Northern Buddhists, and
all Chinamen, in fact, find in the deep roar of some of the great and sacred rivers
the key-note of nature. Hence the simile. It is a well-known fact in physical science,
as well as in occultism, that the aggregate sound of nature such as is heard in the
roar of great rivers, the noise produced by the waving tops of trees in large forests,
or that of a city heard at a distance is a definite single tone of quite an appreciable
624 SYMBOLS AT WORK
pitch. This is shown by physicists and musicians. Thus Professor Rice (Chinese
Music) shows that the Chinese recognized the fact thousands of years ago by saying
that the waters of the Hoang-ho rushing by intoned the kung, called
'
the great
tone
'
in Chinese music ; and he shows this tone corresponding with the F,
'
con-
sidered by modern physicists to be the actual tonic of nature.' Professor B Silliman
mentions it, too, in his Principles of Physics, saying that
'
this tone is held to be the
middle F of the piano, which may therefore be considered the key-note of nature."
C. W. Leadbeater has written in The Hidden Side of Things, p. 211 :
41
There is a yet higher point of view from which all the sounds of nature
'blend themselves into one mighty tone that which the Chinese authors have called
the Kung ;
and this also has its form an inexpressible compound or synthesis of all
forms, vast and changeful as the sea, and yet through it all
upholding an average level,
just as the sea does, all-penetrating yet all-embracing, the note which represents
our earth in the music of the spheres the form which is our petal when the solar
system is
regarded from that plane where it is seen all spread out like a lotus."

OCCULTISM
"
Occultism is not magic. It is
comparat/Ve/y easy to learn the trick of spells
and the methods of using the subtler, but still material, forces of physical nature ; the
powers of the animal soul in man are soon awakened ;
the forces which his love, his
hate, his passion, can call into operation, are readily developed. But this is Black
Magic Sorcery. For it is the motive, and the motive alone, which makes any
exercise of power become black, malignant, or white, beneficent Magic. It is
impos-
sible to employ spiritual forces if there is the slightest tinge of selfishness remaining
in the operator For, unless the intention is
entirely unalloyed, the spiritual will
transform itself into the psychic, act on the astral plane, and dire results may be
produced by it. The powers and forces of animal nature can equally be used by the
selfish and revengeful, as by the unselfish and the all-forgiving ;
the powers and
forces of spirit lend themselves only to the perfectly pure in heart and this is
Divine Magic.
"
What are then the conditions required to become a student of the
'
Divina
Sapientia
'
? For let it be known that no such instruction can possibly be given unless
these certain conditions are complied with, and rigorously carried out during the years
of study, This is a sine qua non. No man can swim unless he enters deep water.
No bird can fly unless its wings are grown, and it has space before it and courage to
trust itself to the air A man who will wield a two-edged sword, must be a thorough
OCCULTISM 625
master of the blunt weapon, if he would not injure himself or what is worse
others, at the first attempt.
"
To give an approximate idea of the conditions under which alone the study of
Divine Wisdom can be pursued with safety, that is, without danger that Divine will
give place to Black Magic, a page is given from the
'
private rules,' with which
every instructor in the East is furnished. The few passages which follow are chosen
from a great number and explained in brackets :
"
1 . The place selected for receiving instruction must be a spot calculated not
to distract the mind, and filled with
'
influence-evolving
'
(magnetic) objects. The
five sacred colours gathered in a circle must be there among other things. The
place must be free from any malignant influences hanging about in the air.
"
(The place must be set apart, and used for no other purpose. The five
'
sacred colours
'
are the prismatic hues arranged in a certain way, as these colours
-are very magnetic. By
'
malignant influences
'
are meant any disturbances through
strifes, quarrels, bad feelings, etc., as these are said to impress themselves immedi-
ately on the astral light, i.e., in the atmosphere of the place, and to hang
'
about in
the air.' This first condition seems easy enough to accomplish, yet on further
consideration, it is one of the most difficult ones to obtain.)
"
2. Before the disciple shall be permitted to study
'
face to face,' he has
to acquire preliminary understanding in a select company of other lay upasaka
{disciples), the number of whom must be odd.
"
('
Face to face/ means in this instance a study independent or apart from
others, when the disciple gets his instruction face to face either with himself (his
higher, Divine Self) or his guru. It is then only that each receives his due of inform-
ation, according to the use he has made of his knowledge. This can happen only
toward the end of the cycle of instruction )
"
3. Before thou (the teacher) shalt impart to thy Lanoo (disciple) the good
(holy) words of Lamrin, or shall permit him '
to make ready
'
for Dt/b/ec/, thou
shalt take care that his mind is thoroughly purified and at peace with all, especially
with his other Selves. Otherwise the words of Wisdom and of the good Law shall
scatter and be picked up by the winds.
"
('
Lamrin
'
is a work of practical instructions, by Tson-kha-pa, in two portions,
one for ecclesiastical and exoteric purposes, the other for esoteric use.
'
To make
ready
'
for Dubjed, is to prepare the vessels used for seership, such as mirrors and
crystals.
The '
other selves
'
refers to the fellow-students. Unless the greatest
harmony reigns among the learners, no success is
possible. It is the teacher who
makes the selections according to the magnetic and electric natures of the students,
bringing together and adjusting most carefully the positive and the negative elements.)
"
4. The upasaka while studying must take care to be united as the fingers
on one hand. Thou shalt impress upon their minds that whatever hurts one should
40
626 SYMBOLS AT WORK
hurt the others , and if the rejoicing of one finds no echo in the breasts of the
others, then the required conditions are absent, and it is useless to proceed.
"
(This can hardly happen if the preliminary choice made was consistent with
the magnetic requirements. It is known that chelas otherwise promising and fit for
the reception of truth, had to wait for years on account of their temper and the
impossibility they felt to put themselves in tune with their companions. For )
"
5. The co-disciples must be tuned by the guru as the strings of a lute
(vina), each different from the others, yet each emitting sounds in harmony with,
all. Collectively they must form a keyboard answering in all its
parts to thy lightest
touch (the touch of the Master). Thus their minds shall open for the harmonies of
Wisdom, to vibrate as knowledge through each and all, resulting in effects pleasing
to the presiding gods (tutelary or patron-angels) and useful to the Lanoo. So shall
Wisdom be impressed for ever on their hearts and the harmony of the law shall
never be broken.
"
6. Those who desire to acquire the knowledge leading to the Siddhis
(occult powers) have to renounce all the vanities of life and of the world (here
follows enumeration of the Siddhis )
"
7. None can feel the difference between himself and his fellow-students,
such as
'
I am the wisest/
'
I am more holy and pleasing to the teacher, or in
my community, than my brother,' etc., and remain an upasaka. His thoughts-
must be predominantly fixed upon his heart, chasing therefrom every hostile thought
to any living being. It
(the heart) must be full of the feeling of its
non-separateness
from the rest of beings as from all in Nature ; otherwise no success can follow.
"
8. A Lanoo (disciple) has to dread external living influence alone (mag-
netic emanations from living creatures.) For this reason, while at one with all, in his
inner nature, he must take care to separate his outer (external) body from every
foreign influence : none must drink out of, or eat in his cup but himself. He must
avoid bodily contact (i.e., being touched or touch) with human, as with animal being.
"
(No pet animals are permitted, and it is forbidden even to touch certain
trees and plants. A disciple has to live, so to say, in his own atmosphere in order
to individualize it for occult purposes.)
"
9. The mind must remain blunt to all but the universal truths in nature,
lest the
'
Doctrine of the Heart
'
should become only the
'
Doctrine of the Eye/
(i.e., empty exoteric ritualism).
11
10. No animal food of whatever kind, nothing that has life in it, should be
taken by the disciple. No wine, no spirits or opium should be used ; for these are like
the Lhamaym (evil spirits), who fasten upon the unwary, they devour the
understanding.
'
(Wine and spirits are supposed to contain and preserve the bad magnetism
of all the men who helped in their fabrication ; the meat of each animal, to preserve
the psychic characteristics of its
kind.)
ORPHEUS, PLANES, POINT 627
"11. Meditation, abstinence, the observation of moral duties, gentle
thoughts, good deeds and kind words, as goodwill to all and entire oblivion of Self,
are the most efficacious means of obtaining knowledge and preparing for the recep-
tion of higher wisdom.
"
12. It is
only by virtue of a strict observance of the foregoing rules that a
Lanoo can hope to acquire in good time the Siddhis of the Arhats, the growth which
makes him become gradually one with the Universal All.
"These 12 extracts are taken from among some 73 rules, to enumerate
which would be useless as they would be meaningless in Europe. But even these
few are enough to show the immensity of the difficulties which beset the path of the
would-be '
Upasaka,' who has been born and bred in Western lands."

28 SYMBOLS AT WORK
PROF. ALEXANDER WILDER, quoted in The Secret Doctrine :
"
The Divine
Being is the All, the source of all existence, the Infinite; and He cannot be known.
The Universe reveals Him and subsists by Him. At the beginning His effulgence went
forth everywhere. Eventually He retired within Himself and so formed around Him
a vacant space. Into this He transmitted His first Emanation, a Ray, containing in it
the generative and conceptive power, and hence the name IE, or JAH. This in its
turn produced the tikkun, the pattern or idea of form ; and in this emanation, which
also contained the male and female, or generative and conceptive potencies, were
the three primitive forces of Light, Spirit and Life. This Tikkun is united to the Ray,
or first emanation, and pervaded by it : and by that union is also in perpetual com-
munication with the infinite source. It is the pattern, the primitive man, the Adam
Kadmon, the macrocosm of Pythagoras and other philosophers."
Neo-P/aton/sm and Alchemy, p. 10, quoting the Kabalistic viewpoint
H. P. BLAVATSKY, The Secret Doctrine :
"
The mathematical Point, called
the 'Cosmic Seed,' the Monad of Leibnitz, which contains the whole Universe, as
the acorn the oak ... is the first bubble on the surface of boundless homogeneous
Substance, or Space, the bubble of differentiation in its incipient stage. It is the
beginning of the Orphic or Brahma's Egg. It
corresponds in Astrology and Astron-
omy to the Sun . . On the Lower Pole it is the terrestrial Embryo . . ."
- Ill, 441 (Adyar ed., V, 422)
"
The point in the hitherto immaculate disk, Space and Eternity in Pralaya,
denotes the dawn of differentiation. It is the Point in the Mundane Egg, the Germ
within it which will become the Universe, the All, the boundless, periodical Kosmos
a Germ which is latent and active, periodically and by turns."
I, 31 (Adyar ed., I, 69)
"The term 'Point' must not be understood as applying to any particular
point in Space, for a germ exists in the centre of every atom, and these collectively
form the
'
Germ
'
; or rather, as no atom can be made visible to our physical eye,
the collectivity of these (if
the term can be applied to something which is boundless
and infinite) forms the noumenon of eternal and indestructible Matter."
I, 87 (Adyar ed, I, 127)
"That 'point,' [into which an entire universe may concentrate itself],
invisible on our plane of perception and matter, is
quite visible to the eye of the
Adept who can follow and see it
present on other planes."
-1,531 (Adyar ed., II, 212)
Referring to the Point as dwelling in the physical body: "The spot in the
heart which is the last of all to die is the seat of life, the centre of all, Brahma, the
first spot that lives in the foetus and the last that dies. When a Yogi is buried in a
trance it is this spot that lives, though the rest of the body be dead, and as long
POINT 629
as this is alive the Yogi can be resurrected. This spot contains potentially mind,
life, energy, and will. During life it radiates prismatic colours, fiery and opalescent.
The heart is the centre of spiritual consciousness, as the brain is the centre of intel-
lectual But this consciousness cannot be guided by a person, nor its energy
directed by him until he is at one with Buddhi-Manas ; until then it
guides him- - if it
can. Hence the pangs of remorse, the prickings of conscience ;
they come from
the heart, not the head. In the heart is the only manifested God, the other two
are invisible, and it is this which represents the Triad, Atma-Buddhi-Manas
"
-III, 582 (Adyar ed., V, 555)
The Secret Doctrine corroborates the Keely idea of a
"
neutral centre
"
on
which the foundations of the universe rest, an atomic centre, for example, of a
planet which
"
carries the full load of any accumulation from the start, and remains
the same, for ever balanced in the eternal space." H. P. B. concludes: "This is
what Occultists understand by a laya centre." --

I. The Point came forth before all
things : it was neither atomic nor mathe-
matical, being a diffused point. The Monad manifested explicitly but a myriad were
implied. There was light and there was darkness, beginning and the end thereof,
the all and naught, being and non-being.
"
II. The Monad produced the Duad by self-motion, and the visages of the
Second Light manifested through the Triad.
"
III A simple, uncreated fire sprang forth, and beneath the waters assumed
the garment of manifold, created fire.

IV. It looked back on the primeval fountain and taking this as a pattern set

V. Unity created the one and the Trinity divided into three It is thus that

"VI. Among things visible the water first shone forth, the feminine aspect
of brooding fire and fruitful mother of figurable things.
"VII. She was porous inwardly and variously clothed with skins: in her
womb were interfolded heavens and inchoate stars.

VIII. The Artificer, who parts asunder, broke up the womb of the waters
into spacious regions ; but when the foetus appeared the mother vanished.

Yoga union with Brahma, exoterically is the supreme condition
of the passive infinite Deity, since it contains all the divine energies and is the
essence of Brahma, who is said, as Brahma, to create everything through Yoga
power. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are the most powerful energies of God, Brahma
(neuter), says a Pauranic text. Yoga here is the same as Dhyana, which word is
again synonymous with Yoga in the Tibetan text, where the
'
Sons of Yoga
'
are
called
4
Sons of Dhyana,' or of that abstract meditation through which the Dhyani-
Buddhas create their celestial sons, the Dhyani-Bodhisattvas.

All the creatures in the world have each a superior above. This superior,

adored [i.e., meditated as during Yoga] '."

ROD OF POWER
C. W. LEADBEATER :
"
This wonderful symbol is in some way a physical
centre or fulcrum for the forces poured forth by the Planetary Logos, and was
magnetized by Him millions of years ago, when first He set the human life-wave in
motion round our chain of globes. We are told that it is the physical sign of the
concentration of the attention of the Logos, and that it is carried from planet to
planet as that attention shifts that where it is, that is for the moment the central
theatre of evolution, and that when it leaves this planet for the next, our earth will
sink into comparative inertia. Whether it is carried also to the non-physical planets
we do not know, nor do we understand exactly the way in which it is used, nor the
ROD OF POWER, SACRIFICE 631
part which it
plays in the economy of the world. It is
kept usually in the custody of
the Lord of the World at Shamballa, and so far as we know this Wesak Festival is the
only occasion on which it ever leaves His care. It is a round bar of the lost metal
orichalcum, perhaps two feet in length and about two inches in diameter, having at
each end a huge diamond shaped into a ball with a cone projecting from it. It has
the strange appearance of being always surrounded by fire of having an aura of
brilliant yet transparent flame. It is
noteworthy that no one but the Lord Maitreya
touches it
during any part of the ceremony." -The Masters and the Path
See also Svastika.
SACRIFICE
"
The Law of Sacrifice is
everywhere present in Nature, because the Lord is
the Lord of Sacrifice, and the first sacrifice is the sacrifice of Himself . . . The
Disciple's heart is an altar, love to his Lord the flame burning on it ,
all his acts,
physical and mental, are sacrifices offered on the altar : and once offered, he has
with them no further concern."
Annie Besant, Hints on the Study of the Bhagavad Gita
With the following words Dr. Besant in 1896 introduced a series of dis-
courses on the Law of Sacr/f/ce, published for the benefit of Famine Relief as a
pamphlet :
"
Not very long ago, one of the great TeachersI mean the Masters made
the remark that the understanding of the Law of Sacrifice was as important for
man's spiritual growth as that of the law of Karma."
It would well repay the reader to carefully peruse the most comprehensive
study therein given on this fundamental Law, especially as at work in the various
kingdoms.
Another splendid article on "
Sacrifice
"
is to be found in the March and April
1931 issues of Jhe Theosophist, written by C. W. Leadbeater in which he reviews
the entire subject and its practice in various Faiths. Therein he says :
"
Never forget that, though we so often use the word in that sense,
'
to
give up something
'
is not the real meaning of sacrifice. Sacrificio in Latin means
'
I make holy,' so to make an offering of anything is the main idea. When you write
a poem or a book, you should do it as a sacrifice. You should offer it
up to God as
the work of your brain, of your hands, for in that way you are really making it a
sacrifice, you are making it
holy. You truly live only when you are a channel for
the divine force. This other life, this life of the separate self, in which every one is
trying to grasp something for himself, is
just a dream ; it is not a real life at all. To
be giving out always is the only true life."

The Brotherhood of Sacrifice," written by A. P. Sinnett for the June 1921
issue of The Theosophist, is a very illuminating article on a Brotherhood existing to
make vicarious atonement in the world.
"
In view of this marvellous distribution of Himself in
'
space/ the familiar
concept of the
'
sacrifice of the Logos
'
takes on a new depth and splendour ;
this is
v
His
'
dying in matter,' His
'
perpetual sacrifice,' and it
may be the very glory
of the Logos that He can sacrifice Himself to the uttermost by thus permeating
and making Himself one with that portion of koilon [root-matter] which He chooses
as the field of His universe
"
Occult Chemistry, Appendix, p. x
"
The man who lives by the Law of Sacrifice realizes the unity of the Self,
and recognizes only a difference in the containing vessel and not in the indwelling
life ;
hence he only gathers wisdom and knowledge into his separate vessel for the
sake of sharing what he. gathers with others, and for others ; and he loses utterly
the sense of separate life, and becomes part of the Life of the World.
"
As he realizes this, and knows that the only value of the body is to be a
channel of the higher, to be an instrument of that life, he slowly and gradually rises
above all thoughts, save the thought of unity, and feels himself a part of this great
suffering world. Then he feels that the griefs of humanity are his griefs, the sins
of humanity are his sins, the weaknesses of his brother are his weaknesses, and
thus he realizes unity, and sees through all differences the underlying One Self.
"
Only in this way can we live in the Eternal
"
Annie Besant, The Laws of the Higher Life
"
There is a profound truth in that great Christian teaching of a Lamb slain
when ? On Calvary ? No,
'
from the foundation of the world
'
That is the great
truth of sacrifice. No Divine sacrifice, no universe. No Divine self-limitations,
none of the worlds which fill the realms of space. It is all a sacrifice, the sacrifice of
love that limits itself that others may gain self-conscious being and rejoice in the
perfection of their own ultimate Divinity. And inasmuch as the life of the world is
based on sacrifice, all true life is also sacrificial ; and when every action is done as
sacrifice, then the man becomes the perfect, spiritual man."

SALT
Such an essential element in the body that its loss in body hemorrhages or
undue perspiration must be immediately replaced with salt solution or death-like
fatigue results. It controls the liquid balance in the body and without adequate salt
the tissues shrivel for want of fluid. Salt is an age-old symbol of Life, as Dread is of
form ; and so the Bread and Salt ceremony of olden rituals was equivalent to
the Wine and Bread of the eucharistic communion.
SAMADHI
C. W. LEADBEATER :
"
Contemplation is concentration at the top end of your
line of thought or meditation
"
It
"
may be like piercing a cloud or fog, out of which the new vision will
gradually form itself, or from which it
may come like a flash of lightning." It is an
attempt
"
to go into the subjective meaning

of the object contemplated.

SPIRALS OF EVOLUTION
C. W. LEADBEATER :
"
The spirals of evolution are still more far-reaching, so
that the successive divisions of human life give us an epitome of the kingdoms of
nature. The human embryo in the course of its
growth takes on the appearance of
each of the earlier kingdoms in succession ; and besides that, in the development of
the human body the gestation period reflects the downward course of the elemental
kingdoms mentioned in Theosophical literature ; from birth to about the age of
seven we have a time in which the wisest educationists consider that the child's
physical nature should receive more attention than the emotional and mental ;
next
up to the age of about fourteen, there is an epoch in which the right development
of the emotions should have chief consideration ; then follows another term to the
age of about twenty-one when the teachers should appeal especially to the unfolding
powers of the mind. These last three ages may be taken to correspond to a certain
extent to the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms. . . . There is then a long
period of middle life the real human career. That is followed in turn by the epoch

of old age . . .
being but an adumbration of the superhuman heights of future
attainment." The Hidden L/fe in Freemasonry
SUN
"
The sun is the mighty source from which proceed all the forces which set
in motion the earth and its life. It is its heat which causes the wind to blow, the
clouds to ascend, the river to flow, the forest to grow, fruit to ripen, and man him-
self to live. The force constantly and silently expended in raising the reservoirs of
rain to their mean atmospheric height, in fixing the carbon in the plants, in giving to
terrestrial nature its vigour and its beauty, has been calculated from a mechanical
point of view ; it is
equal to the work of 217 billions 316 thousand millions horse-
power ; 543 milliards (543,000,000,000) of steam engines, each with an effective
power of 400 horses, would have to work day and night without intermission such
is the permanent work of the sun upon the earth.
"
We may not think so, but everything which moves, circulates, and lives on
our planet is the child of the sun. The generous wine whose transparent ruby cheers
the French table, the champagne which sparkles in the crystal cup, are so many rays
of the sun stored up for our taste. The most nutritious foods come from the sun.
The wood which warms us in winter is, again, the sun in fragments ;
every cubic
inch, every pound of wood, is formed by the power of the sun. The mill which
turns under the impulse of wind or water revolves only by the sun. And in the
black night, under the rain or snow, the blind and noisy train which darts like a flying
serpent through the fields, rushes along above the valleys, is swallowed up under the
mountains, goes hissing past the stations, of which the pale eyes strike silently
through the mist in the midst of night and cold, this modern animal, produced by
human industry, is still a child of the sun ; the coal from the earth which feeds its
stomach is solar work stored up during millions of years in the geological strata of
the globe, As it is certain that the force which sets the watch in motion is derived
from the hand which has wound it, so is it certain that all terrestrial power proceeds
from the sun. It is its heat which maintains the three states of bodies solid, liquid
and gaseous ; the last two would vanish, there would be nothing but solids, water
and air itself would be in massive blocks, if the solar heat did not maintain them in
the fluid state. It is the sun which blows in the air, which flows in the water, which
moans in the tempest, which sings in the unwearied throat of the nightingale. It
attaches to the sides of the mountains the sources of the rivers and glaciers ; and
consequently the cataracts and the avalanches are precipitated with an energy which
they draw directly from him. Thunder and lightning are in their turn a manifestation
of his power. Every fire which burns and every flame which shines has received its
life from the sun. And when two armies are hurled together with a crash, each
charge of cavalry, each shock between two army corps, is
nothing else but the
SUN, SVASTIKA 635
misuse of mechanical force from the same star. The sun comes to us in the form
of heat, he leaves us in the form of heat, but between his arrival and his departure
he has given birth to the varied powers of our globe.
"
Presented to our mind under their true aspect, the discoveries and general-
izations of modern science constitute, then, the most sublime poem which has ever
been offered to the intelligence and the imagination of man. The physicist of our
day, we may say with Tyndall, is
incessantly in contact with marvels which eclipse
those of Ariosto and Milton ; marvels so grand and so sublime that those who study
them have need of a certain force of character to preserve them from being dazed.
"
And still all this is
nothing, or almost nothing, in comparison with the real
power of the sun ! The liquid state of the ocean, the gaseous state of the atmo-
sphere , the currents of the sea ; the raising of the clouds, the rains, storms, streams,
rivers ; the calorific value of all the forests of the globe and all the coal mines of
the earth ; the motion of all
living beings ; the heat of all
humanity ; the stored-up
power in all human muscles, in all the manufactories, in all the guns- all that is
almost nothing compared with that of which the sun is
capable. Do we think that
we have measured the solar power by enumerating the effects which it
produces on
the earth ? Error !
profound, tremendous, foolish error ! This would be to believe
still that this star has been created on purpose to illuminate terrestrial humanity. In
reality, what an infinitesimal fraction of the sun's total radiation the earth receives
and utilizes ! In order to appreciate it, let us consider the distance of 93 millions of
miles which separates us from the central star, and at this distance let us see what
effect our little globe produces, what heat it
intercepts. Let us imagine an immense
sphere traced at this distance from the sun, and entirely surrounding it. Well, on
this gigantic sphere, the spot intercepted by our little earth is
only equivalent to

THE WHEEL OF THE LAW
"
C. W. Leadbeater : The Wheel is the symbol associated in the Buddhist books
with the Lord Buddha's first Sermon in the Deer Park at Isipatana, near Benares, in
which He announced His great discovery. The Sermon is
commonly known as the
Dhammachakkappavattana Sutta, briefly translated as the
"
Turning of the Wheel of
the Law," though Rhys Davids has translated it as the
"
Setting in Motion of the
Royal Chariot-Wheels of the Kingdom of Righteousness
"... It explains for the first time the Four Noble Truths and the
Noble Eightfold Path, expounding the great Middle Way of the Buddha the life of
perfect righteousness in the world, which lies midway between the extravagances of
asceticism on the one hand and the carelessness of mere worldly life on the other."
The Masters and the Path
Paul Carus :
tl
The Buddha is
reported to have said .
'
The spokes of the
wheel are the rules of pure conduct ;
justice is the uniformity of their length ;
wisdom is the tire ,
modesty and thoughtfulness are the hub in which the immovable
axle of truth is fixed." The Gospel of Buddha
Henry Alabaster : The symbol of the Wheel figures prominently in Buddhist
sculptures and frescoes, mostly as a beautifully decorated Shivachakra, like an
aureole, behind the head 'of the Lord Buddha, more rarely as a canopy above the
statue. There are many such figures at Sanchi and Sarnath, and in art museums.
The oldest wheels shown from designs sculptured on the Sanchi Topes, dating from
about 500 B.C. to A.D. 100, are sixteen-spoked with the svastika in the centre, the
whole radiating light and enthroned on a pedestal, somewhat as is the reserved
sacrament in monstrance which it resembles.
The Holy Wheel is much older than Buddhism. The Lord Buddha adopted
it from Hinduism.
"
In the La//ta Vistara, we read of it as the most marvellous of
the seven extraordinary possessions of an emperor of the whole world. Turned by
his hand, it rolls before him and his armies, causing all to bow down to him and
acknowledge his righteous rule." The Wheel of the Law, p. 287
T. W. Rhys-Davids .
"
The Wheel of Fate, of life and death, figures also in>
the Orphic theogony , the soul longs to escape from the weary unending cycle of
birth, and entreats the gods, especially Dionysos, for release." Buddhism, p. 161
W. Y. Evans-Wentz: Tibetan Buddhism has two symbols for the Cross-
Svastika idea. Two of the Dorjes or Lamaic Rods of Power are crossed and as the
central heart appears the Svastika in two interlaced triangles. This magnificent
symbol, radiating light from its crossed globe-arms, represents equilibrium, immuta-
bility, and almighty power.
The Tibetan Wheel of the Law [Ch'os-Yor-bskor] is an eight-spoked
Lotus-Bud Wheel, in the centre of which is the rgyan-'k'yil, or three whirling

symbolizing as does the svastika at the centre of the Indian
Wheel of the Law the Sangsara, or ceaseless change or
'
becoming.'
"
The whole
wheel is on a lotus throne [of drooping petals] and is enhaloed by Flames of
Wisdom,
"
representative of the Thousand-spoked Wheel of the Good Law of the
Buddha, symbol of the symmetry and completeness of the Sacred Law of the
Dharma, or Scriptures." The T/betan Book of the Dead
The lotus symbolism is
explained by C. W. Leadbeater in
describing the three
positions of the lilies on the ancient pillars of King Solomon's Temple, which
represented
"
the initiates of the three stages of the Egyptian Mysteries
"
as well as
the triple Cosmic Logoi.
"
The buds of the upper row, pointing upwards, typified the initiates of the
Mysteries of Isis, who were full of aspiration . . . .the flowers of the middle
row, opened and facing outwards, were the initiates of Serapis, showing forth by
their lives the glory, dignity and power of humanity as it should be. The third row
of drooping lilies represented the initiates of the Mysteries of Osiris, [comparable to
Arhatship] reaching down into the world in order to devote themselves to the
helping and enlightenment of humanity." The Hidden Life in
Freemasonry

SYMBOLS
"
The supreme truths of Cosmology, known to the initiate priests, were taught
the simple-minded humble worshippers in allegory, and the greater Mysteries were
concealed in symbol, to be revealed only to the open eye of spiritual understanding.
The most beautiful of the Gods may often be depicted as dark-visaged and in ugly
forms, first, because no image could indicate such supernal beauty ; and second,
because were even an attempt to be made, the worshipper's attention would be
638 SYMBOLS AT WORK
distracted from the hidden Life to a mere external form. Always the Hindu devotee
sees behind the form to the aspect of Deity symbolized and the form becomes a
touchstone to the divine embodied Reality within." (From "A Key to Hindu Sym-
bology
"
in Jhe Shrines of Adyar, to which the reader is referred for an inter-
pretation of the many symbols to be found in Adyar, the Headquarters of The
Theosophical Society.
"
And to know the Shrines of Adyar is to know the Shrines
of the Faiths of the world.")
As Channels '
Various experiments were tried in the Liberal Catholic Church
in the placing of the celebrant and his assistants. A foot-note says :
"
It has been
thought that the triangle being a living symbol would act as a great channel, but this
form of magic making connections in this way with the archetypes belongs more
to the Egyptian form of ceremonial. ..."
The student in making correlations must refrain from any dogmatism, for the
machinery of the Church is
designed for one purpose, and the use of the archetypes
or
"
living symbols . ,
belongs more to the Egyptian form of ceremonial."

THE SYMBOLS THROUGH THE KINGDOMS
Jhe Symbols, as .revealed through the developing structures of cellular and
embryonic life.
[References marked (
+ ) are quoted from Gray's Anatomy, 1930.]
Jhe Point It is difficult to get to the root of a primal Point in cellular life,
for one point seemingly homogeneous, upon examination, reveals within itself a com-
plex structure Point within Point. The Cell itself is a Point ; within the Cell is the
Nuclear Area, another apparent Point ; within that area is the Nucleus, surely a Point,
and within the Nucleus the Nucleoli all Points. Within the Nuclear Area is
gener-
ally a Centrosome, and within that again Centrioles or Central Bodies, which play an
important part in cell-division.
The Male Pronucleus, the Point from the spermatozoon, fusing with the
Female Point or Pronucleus within the Ovum, itself a Point, generates
l
the Embryo
or fertilized Ovum, that Point of Points which is to become the vehicle for Men-Gods.
Jhe Web-Womb : The first stage within the development of new life is
perhaps most clearly indicated in the Anaphase of indirect division the common
method of cellular unfoldment in the higher animals :
"
Starting with the nucleus in
1 "
The permanent atom [vibrating central physical nucleus of the Ego about to come into
incarnation] enters the seminal fluid and attaches itself to a spermatozoon ; the physical sheath of
the thread to which the atom is attached, connecting it with the higher atoms, is completed
in the fourth month, and with this there is a flow of life downwards from the jiva, and
'
quickening
'
occurs. I think this is what is meant by the
'
jiva comes and enters, etc
'
Until this sheath round
the connecting thread is formed, the jiva cannot reach the foetus. After that there is free com-
munication between the growing foetus and the astral and mental bodies. Up to this stage, the
vegetative and animal processes might have gone on
'
mechanically ', i.e., without the presence of
a permanent atom, but if that is absent, miscarriage before or at this time must occur

This stage,

gathered around a central colony, appears to be
found in the earliest development of the various organs.

Jhe Line : This is one of the most clearly indicated of all the symbols, from
the cellular development to the embryo itself.

In the Anaphase stage of reproduction
of cells by indirect division,
"
the centrosome divides and the two resulting centro-
somes are seen to be connected by a spindle of delicate achromatic fibres, the
achromatic spindle. The centrosomes move away from each other one towards
either extremity of the nucleus and the fibrils of the achromatic spindle are corre-
spondingly lengthened" [p. 3 (
+ )].
So is established a North and South Pole
within the primal cell. In the direct division or amitosis of the more primitive cell-
life, the nucleus assumes an hour-glass shape before division. The Spermatid
develops a tail-like line to carry the sperm to the ovum [pp. 48-9 (
+ )].
The
chromosomes likewise around the segmentation nucleus of the embryo assume two
bundles of parallel lines, veritable lictor's rods [Diagram 5, p. 50 (
+ )].
'
As Professor Tyndall has so wisely said :
"
Everywhere throughout our planet we notice this
tendency of the ultimate particles of matter to run into symmetric lines. The very molecules seem
instinct with a desire for union ar.d growth."
640 SYMBOLS AT WORK
In the early stage of the development of the embryo, lines within appear : The
brain and heart both first appear as tube-like linear structures, the heart bending to
form a spiral loop in the first few weeks of embryonic life. Even the lung-buds
show a polarity of North and South in the human embryo of about five weeks [Fig.
147, p. 112; fig, 177-8, p. 134; fig. 229, p. 175 (
+ )].
As in the organs, so in the embryo itself :
During the third week this linear
tendency becomes noticeable.
"
The embryonic area ... at first nearly circular
. . .
rapidly alters and becomes oval, indicating the long axis of the body.
The oval area becomes pear-shaped, and in the median plane of its narrower portion
there appears a linear opacity which is termed the primitive streak. . . . The
presence of the primitive streak indicates that rapid growth is
occurring throughout
its site. The headward end of the primitive streak is an area of exceptionally active
growth and forms a knob-like thickening which is termed the primitive node
"
[p. 56
( + )].
From primitive streak to Neural groove, we note the Line, but Curved in ap-
pearance as a slightly drooping Lotus bud. At the North Pole of the Line there
develops the Head-process, at the South Pole the Body-stalk.
Fig. 74, p. 56
The very anchoring of foetus in the womb indicates a linear tendency up to
the third month, for it
swings cradle-like from the vertical line of the umbilical cord
in the cavity of the amnion [See fig. 104, p. 76 (
+ ), our page 641].
SYMBOLS 64t
The Circle-Globe : This is
clearly indicated in the next stage of growth of the
embryo and its individual organs. The Line, having established its diameter of
operation in the embryo,
"
in the fifth week . . . becomes markedly curved on
itself ... In the sixth week the curvature of the embryo is further increased.
The head is in contact with the umbilical cord, and may almost meet the long curved
tail
"
[p. 193 (
+ )].
Fig. 254, p. 193 Fig. 104, p. 76
By the third month a decided globular appearance has been assumed by the
brain [fig. 151, p. 116 (
+ )],
whereas the heart, which develops more rapidly,
by the sixth week is
globular in form [fig. 179, p. 134 (
+ )]. And all rests within
the developed Amnion, itself a Circle-Globe, with its various circular layers of
nourishment and protection [fig. 104, p. 76 (+)]
Even in the single cell, during the later stages of the anaphase, one notices a
tendency towards the ellipse in the achromatic spindle formed from the centrosomes
[p. 3, diagrams 3 and 4 (*-)].
The Cross. And now appears the latitudinal development bisecting the
longitude of Lines. This is noted most vividly in the movement of the chromosomes,
marking the final stage in the anaphase of the animal cell :
"
An imaginary [? ?]
line encircling the spindle midway between its extremities or poles is named the
equator and around this the chromosomes arrange themselves, forming what is
known as the equatorial plate.

The Cross is also very evident in that most fundamental of organs the
heart, and is shown in the horizontal separation of atriums from ventricles crossing
the vertical divisions of right and left [fig. 180, p. 135 (
+ )].
At the end of the
third month, the longitudinal and latitudinal cross of the brain is also plainly evident
[fig. 155, p. 119( + )].
The latitudinal development of the whole foetus develops
rapidly from the second month on, and by the end of the third month the limbs are
well developed [p. 194 (
+ )] those limbs which later, when extended, make of
man's body the perfect cross.
The Svastika or Whirling Cross Symbol of Movement : While its

the fifth month.
Movement is also shown in the metaphase of the process of reproduction of
cell-life.
" Each chromosome splits longitudinally into two equal parts or daughter
chromosomes which travel in opposite directions along the fibrils of the achromatic
spindle towards the centrosomes around which they group themselves ; and thus
each group contains the same number of chromosomes as was present in the
equatorial plate."
The Svastika has been the age-old symbol of the differentiation and division
of Creative Activity, and in the embryo likewise differentiation reaches its climax
during this period.

responds by piercing its sheath, the Web- Womb. The germ sends upward and
downward a curved shoot, the Line, bent almost Circle-wise. When linear move-
ment has slowed down, it starts its Cross-//ke horizontal expansion. Those whose

atom the final stages being omitted.
In the Fundamental or Ultimate Atom, both Male and Female, can be
observed these various symbols at work. [Compare Plate II

around a Linear Longitudinal Axis, and describes a central orbit Circle. Within
the heart of each atom is to be seen a flaming cross

reflection of the Svastika, and its regular heart-like pulsation of contraction and
expansion is as the opening and closing of the Lotus Flower, the Breathing of

THE SYMBOLS IN PHYSICS
Sir Oliver Lodge in Ether and Reality :
[An excellent description of a physical
plane reflection of the relationship between Point and Web ?]
"
Space is full, not of
matter, but of Ether. The Ether is other than matter ; and it fills all
space in the
most thorough manner : there is
nothing so omnipresent and so efficient in the
physical universe ... we have no means of making a vacuum in the Ether
and feeling its pressure . . . The first thing to realize about the Ether is its
absolute continuity . . . Since the particles of matter are . . .
separated from
each other and never in contact, it would seem to follow that they are all
independent of each other, disconnected, nothing uniting them the particles
completely separated by empty space. If there were nothing existent but matter,
that would be so ; there would be no unification, no binding force, no family
relationship, nothing but separate independent particles : that is what would happen
if
Space were really empty ; and the universe would be not a cosmos but a chaos
. . . the uniting
'
something
'
is not composed of particles at all ; it is con-
tinuous ; it unites the particles with a force which is known as Cohesion. . . .
The particles embedded in the Ether are not independent of it, they are closely
connected with it, it is
probable that they are formed out of it :
they are not like
grains of sand suspended in water, they seem more like minute crystals formed in a
mother liquor."
[Is Sir Oliver Lodge here suggesting the Line ?]
"
We never really generate or destroy electricity : what one body has gained,
another has lost, and when the balance is restored, there is equilibrium. We
produce or display electric charge simply by transfer, simply by making manifest
what was previously existent. We pull out infinitesimal lines of force and make
them extend across perceptible space : we thus in a way generate an electric field ;
but the field was pre-existent, though infinitesimal and non-apparent before we
displayed it. If we liken the lines of force to elastic threads, they are elastic threads
of infinitesimal length, capable of being stretched ad libitum, without limit ; the lines
never snap, nor do they ever shrink up into absolute nothingness . . . however
violently we treat them. Whether they ever shrink to nothingness of their own
accord, remains to be seen : such a discovery has not yet been made."
[Is
the force of magnetism allied to the Circle ?]
"
There is a fundamental difference between electric and magnetic lines of
force ... an electric line of force has two ends, a positive end on a proton,
a negative end on an electron. A magnetic line of force has no ends, it is
always a
closed loop : we may not think of a magnetic line of force as analogous to an
elastic thread reaching from one particle to another and pulling them together ; it
is more like an india-rubber ring, it is
looped or closed on itself, it has no ends. But
SYMBOLS 647
the loop is one that can be stretched, it can be expanded so as to enclose a big
area, or it can shrink up until it is too small to be appreciable, it never shuts up to
nothing. It never goes out of existence. If
you call these loops magnetism, we
never generate magnetism ; we open it out. The act of magnetization opens a
loop out, and, being elastic, it is
always trying to close up. When a loop encloses
two bodies, and then shrinks, it
pulls them together as if
they attracted each other.
That is
magnetic attraction. Rather like an india-rubber ring holding things
together."
Sir Oliver contrasts the electric charge which is transferred, one body losing
what the other gains, with the magnetic charge which is exercised by
"
induction
without loss : one magnet can magnetize any number of others without itself being
any the poorer ; there is no limit to the amount of magnetization that can be pro-
duced, once it is started."
One of the earliest discoveries was that electricity could generate magnetism
by separating an electron from a proton and rushing one of them along :
"
the two
are remarkably interrelated ;
they are by no means the same thing . . .
magnet-
ism can generate electricity" through the release of "energy to generate an
electric current, that is to set electrons in motion."
[Is this the Cross ?]
Sir Oliver quotes Prof. Einstein that
"
the idea of motion [locomotion]
may not be applied to it
[ether]," in the heading to his chapter on "
Electro-
Magnetism."
"
An electron at rest has nothing magnetic about it : it has a field of electric
force ; lines of force radiate from it in all directions : it seems to have a centre or
nucleus in a certain locality, but its lines of force stretch out everywhere. An
electron is
capable of locomotion ; locomotion is one characteristic of every form of
matter ; it is doubtful if the unmodified ether is
capable of locomotion, at any rate
we don't know how to set it
moving. But we do know how to move an electron,
its field or force gives us a handle : it is
easy to move, it is the most mobile thing
we know : it has extremely little inertia, and the smallest force will set it
going very
quickly.
"
When it moves ... its line of motion is surrounded by magnetic rings
. . The faster it moves the more those rings open out, the bigger they grow,
until they become conspicuous. A moving electron is surrounded by a magnetic
field . . . The energy of a moving electron can be calculated. If it is
stopped,
what becomes of that energy?" Sir Oliver asks what becomes of the magnetic
rings ?
"
If the impact is violent enough, the rings do not shrink, they rather expand :
the electric and the magnetic fields which had previously existed quietly together,
now combine into an Ether disturbance. They travel out as waves, not a series of
waves, but a pulse, a shell of wave, rapidly expanding with the speed of light. And
648 SYMBOLS AT WORK
they carry with them the momentum of their origin. The moving electron had extra
mass, temporary matter and that extra mass, when it
stops is converted into a
quantum of radiation. Such wave-like shells were discovered by Rontgen ; they are
known as X-rays."
[Trie Svastika ?]
"
But now comes an important though perhaps rather difficult point. The
magnetic field surrounding the electron possessed energy ... In what form is the
energy in a magnetic loop or ring ? We do not know ; we can make a surmise, based
on certain evidence ; but experiment has not yet answered. The great mathe-
matician, Sir Joseph Larmor, who holds the Chair of Newton at Cambridge, has
surmised that round a magnetic loop the Ether is
circulating, not necessarily quickly,
but circulating, as a curtain-ring might be spinning in its own plane, or like the rim
of a spinning-top or fly-wheel ;
and that the energy is
represented by this circula-
tion. I said that the Ether was not capable of locomotion, or at least that we had
no means of getting hold of it and moving it from place to place. That remains
true, but a spin is not locomotion. There is no locomotion about a spinning-top, if
it is
merely spinning. Such motion is sometimes called
'
stationary motion
'
;
it is
not apparent unless you try to stop it ... What generated this spinning motion in
the Ether ? What was the origin of these spinning loops ? No one knows : Science
cannot answer the question of
'
origin
'
or genesis. We have no means of generating
such loops :
they are there : all we can do is to open them out and make them
apparent."
[Is radiation the Lotus Flower ?]
"
Matter excites radiation at its own expense : does radiation [the lotus flower}
ever, anywhere, give rise to matter [the particles ] ? . . . Matter tends to fall to-
gether gravitationally : but radiation tends to spread to the confines of the universe.
And yet, however diluted, it retains its vigour. When quanta are thus isolated, what
are they ? What becomes of them ? There is some deep meaning even in the speed
with which light travels ; no greater speed seems possible. In that speed, and in
the newly presented puzzles about the connexion between ether and matter, and
about the nature of radiation ... we are down among the foundations of material
being. We stand as it were enthralled by the revelation which is
dawning upon us.
Confronted with a majestic vision of Reality, we like those other explorers on their
first view of the Pacific Ocean have

THE GLADSOME LIFE
"
The river rippled past with strong, even sweep. Below was the deep pool,
with smiles and glintings of light on its dark face, where the salmon, after their Song
run from the sea, rested awhile before taking up their positions in the swift water, in
which they love to lie, balancing themselves against the rush and tremor of the
current. Above were the riffles, making white foam patches of the water, as if
they
were having a soap-bubble party all to themselves. The big white bubbles would
come dancing, swinging down to the eddies behind the rocks, where a playful young
grilse would shoot up through them, scattering them merrily, and adding a dozen
more bubbles and wimples to the running troop as he fell back into his eddy with a
musical splash that set all the warblers on the bank to whistling. Now and then a
big white patch would escape all this and enter sedately the swift run of water along
the great ledge on the farther shore. My big salmon lived there ; and just as the
foam patch dipped sharply into the quiet water below, he would swirl under it and
knock it into smithereens with a blow of his tail.
"
So the play went on, while I sat watching it
watching the shadows, watching
the dabs and pencillings of light and the changing reflections, watching the foam
bubbles with special delight and anticipation, betting with myself how far they would
run, whether to the second eddy or to the rim of the pool, before the salmon would
smash them in their play. Then a shadow fell on the water, and I looked up to
watch the great eagle breasting, balancing, playing with the mighty air-currents
above, as the fishes played in the swift rush of water below.
"
He set his wings square to the wind at first and slanted swiftly up, like a well
hung kite. But that was too fast for leisure hours. He had only dropped down to
the pool in idle curiosity to see what was doing. Then, watching his wing tips
keenly through my glass, I saw the quills turn ever so slightly, so as to spill the wind
from their underside, as a skipper slacks sheets to deaden his boat's headway, and
the wonderful upward spiral flight began.
"
Just how he does it only the eagle himself knows ; and with him it is
largely
a matter of slow learning. The young birds make a sad bungle of it when they try
it for the first time, following the mother eagle, who swings just above and in front
of them to show them how it is done.
"
Over me sweeps my eagle in slow, majestic circles ; ever returning upon his
course, yet ever higher than his last wheel, like a life with a great purpose in it ;
sliding evenly upward on the wind's endless stairway as it
slips from under him.
Without hurry, without exertion just a twist of his wide-set wing quills, so
slight that my eye can no longer notice it he swings upward ; while the earth
spreads wider and wider below him, and rivers flash in the sun, like silver ribbons,
across the green forest carpet that spreads away over mountain and valley to the
farthest horizon.

Smaller and smaller grow the circles now, till the vast spiral reaches its
apex, and he hangs there in the air, looking with quiet, kindling eyes over Isaiah's
royal land of
'
farnesses/ like a tiny humming-bird poised over the earth's great
flower cup. So high is he that one must think he glances over the brim
of things, and sees our earth as a great bubble floating in the blue ether, with
nothing whatever below it and only himself above. And there he stays, floating,
balancing, swaying in the purring currents of air that hold him fast in their soft
arms and brush his great wings tenderly with a caress that never grows weary, like
a great, strong mother holding her little child.
"
He had fed ; he had drunk to the full from a mountain spring. Now he
rested over the world that nourished him and his little ones, with his keen eyes
growing sleepy, and never a thought of harm to himself or any creature within his
breast. For that is a splendid thing about all
great creatures, even the fiercest of
them ;
they are never cruel. They take only what they must to supply their neces-
sities. When their wants are satisfied there is truce which they never break. They
live at peace with all
things, small and great, and, in their dumb unconscious way,
answer to the deep harmony of the world which underlies all its superficial discords,
as the music of the sea is never heard till one moves far away from the uproar
along the shore.
"
The little wild things all know this perfectly. When an eagle, or any other
bird or beast of prey, is not hunting which is nine-tenths of the time the timidest
and most defenceless creature has no fear of him whatever.
"
My eyes grow weary, at last, watching the noble bird, so small a speck on
the infinite blue background ; and they blur suddenly, thinking of the joy of his
great free life, and the sadness of our unnatural humanity."

FLOWERS
"A flower is one of Nature's joyous expressions of an all-pervading cosmic
power. It lifts a song to the sun, and brings to the face of the earth a complexion
of youthfulness and vitality.
"
It not only lends beauty to any landscape, but provides a contrast between
the many aspects of creation which, paradoxical though it
may sound, is an essential
of cosmic rhythm.
"
A man who cannot see in a flower something more than a mere growth to
be analysed in material terms is
surely missing a part of life's adventure, in that he
cannot scale his own mountain of self-consciousness . . . The smallest flower in
the smallest cranny of the precipice is as much a part of hill and dale as a whole
range of peaks trodden by tall clouds.

He who has studied both systems, the Hatha and the Raja Yoga, finds an
enormous difference between the two : one is
purely psycho-physiological, the other
purely psycho-spiritual. The Tantrists do not seem to go higher than the six visible
and known plexuses, with each of which they connect the Tattvas ; and the great
stress they lay on the chief of these, the Muladhara Chakra (the sacral plexus),
shows the material and selfish bent of their efforts towards the acquisition of
powers. Their five Breaths and five Tattvas are chiefly concerned with the prostatic,
epigastric, cardiac, and laryngeal plexuses. Almost ignoring the Ajna, they are
positively ignorant of the synthesizing laryngeal plexus. But ... we begin
with the mastery of that organ which is situated at the base of the brain, in the
pharynx, and called by Western Anatomists the Pituitary Body." Madame Blavatsky
goes on to show that through this

"
Yoga is union with the Divine. Action must be skilful in the case of the
man who has this union, for it is not he who does the work, but God in him."
And on page 201 :
" The perfect carrying out of the duties that have to be done in the world
is what shows that the force coming down from the higher planes is
being turned in
the right direction. ... If a man is
disciplined on the higher planes his lower activ-

Dr. Besant was not among those Indian Yogis who regard

YOGA IN TIBET
"
In the body of man as he is in our present Fourth Round there are
four kingdoms of living creatures :
(1) those of the Element Fire, (2) those of the
Element Air, (3) those of the Element Water, and (4) those of the Element Earth.
Over this collective life of innumerable myriads of lives man is
king. If he be a
Great King, filled with the transcendent consciousness of the triumphant Yogi (or
Saint), to him the countless multitude of his elemental subjects severally reveal
themselves in their true nature and place in his hand the Sceptre (symbolized by the
Tibetan dorje or thunderbolt) of Universal Dominion over Matter. Then, indeed,
is he Lord of Nature, becoming in his turn Ruler by Divine Right, a Chakravartin, or
Universal Emperor, God and Creator."

YOGA IN HINDUISM
Trie Invocation in the Yoga Darshana version of Patanjali's Sutras to which
one always refers all those desirous of understanding Yoga from the Hindu standpoint .
"
May the resplendent Lord of Serpents protect you, He who, administering
Yoga, while himself equipped with it, having an excellent body of pure white, ever-
delighting in a serpentine body, the fountain-head of all wisdom, having the mass of
impediments destroyed, bearing terrific poison, One who having renounced his
original body, is able to confer manifold benefits on the world !
"
(p. 1).
On page 38 of the Yoga Darshana Yoga is viewed as Communion, and one
is considered nearest to it who has acquired
"
intensely ardent dispassion."
On page 54, Yoga is seen as
"
Friendliness towards the happy,
Compassion towards the Unhappy,
Satisfaction towards the Righteous,
Indifference for the Unrighteous."
On page 75, treating the subject of asceticism, the Sutras say: "(1)
Asceticism, (2) Self-Instruction, and (3) Devotion to the Supreme Lord constitute
the Yogic Discipline/' but
"
that form of Asceticism has to be practised which does
not disturb the composure of the Mind." The editor's note thereon is :
"
The
commentator here distinctly denies the theory of penance and the like religious
austerities being the means to Yoga. In his opinion a peaceful equilibrium of Mind
alone can lead to Yoga, and austerities are likely to disturb this equilibrium by the
physical effort involved."

"
The Omnificent (Vishvakarma), called the
'
Great Architect of the Universe/
. . .
Esoterically, He is the personification of the creative manifested Power ; and
mystically He is the seventh principle in man, in its collectivity. For He is the son of
Bhuvana, the self-created, luminous Essence, and of the virtuous, chaste and lovely
Yoga-Siddha, the virgin Goddess, whose name speaks for itself, since it
personified
Yoga-power, the
'

that creates the Adepts. In the Rig-Vaidic
Hymns, Vishvakarma performs the 'great sacrifice,' i.e., sacrifices himself for the
world ; or, as the Nirukta is made to say, translated by the Orientalists :

Vishva-
karma first of ail offers up all the world in a sacrifice, and then ends by sacrificing
himself.'

This word, derived from the root Yuj ('
to join ')
is in grammar sandhi,
in logic avayavashakti, or the power of the parts taken together, and in its most
widely known and present sense the union of the //Va, or embodied spirit, with the
Paramatma, or Supreme Spirit, and the practices by which this union may be
attained [as the Saradatilaka (chap, xxv) says :
Aikyam-jivatmanorahuryogam yoga-
visharadah].
There is a natural yoga, in which all
beings are, for it is only by virtue of
this identity in fact that they
*
exist. This position is common ground, though in
practice too frequently overlooked.
'
Primus modus unionis est, quo Deus, ratione
suae immensitatis est in omnibus rebus per essentiam, praesentiam, et potentiam ;
per essentiam ut dans omnibus esse ;
per praesentiam ut omnia prospiciens ;
per
.potentiam ut de omnibus disponens.' [Summa Theologiaa Mysticas, torn, iii, p. 8,
R. P. Philippi]. The mystical theologian cited, however, proceeds to say :
'
Sed haec
unio animae cum Deo est generalis, communis omnibus et ordinis naturalis . . . ilia
namque de qua loquimur est ordinis supernaturalis actuahs et fructiva,' It is of this
special yoga, though not in reality more '
supernatural
'
than the first, that we here
deal. Yoga in its technical sense is the realization of this identity, which exists,
though it is not known, by the destruction of the false appearance of separation.
There is no bond equal in strength to maya, and no force greater to destroy that
bond than yoga. There is no better friend than knowledge (jnana), nor worse enemy
than egoism (ahangkara). As to learn the Shastra one must learn the alphabet, so
yoga is necessary for the acquirement of tattvajnona (truth) [Gheranda Sanghita,
chap, v, et seq.]. The animal body is the result of action, and from the body flows
action, the process being compared to the see-saw movement of a ghatiyanira. or
water-lifter. Through their actions beings continually go from birth to death. The
complete attainment of the fruit of yoga is lasting and unchanging life in the
noumenal world of the Absolute."

HATHA AND RAJA YOGAS
"
Sj. Atal Bihari Ghosh has added here the following :
'
Before the shishya
can practise yoga in its highest form, in Raja-Yoga, he must perfect his material
body by means of Hatha-Yoga, so that it becomes '
beyond contraries
'
(Skt. Dvan-
dvatita) heat and cold, dampness and dryness, and all similar physical opposites. To
this end are necessary the various yogic processes prescribed for purifying the body
(Skt. Dhaut/'-Shodhana), the various bodily postures (Skt. Asana and Mudra) and
control of the breathing (Skt. Pranayama). The Gheranda-Sangh/'ta and the Hatha-
yoga-Pradipika describe Hatha-Yoga as the staircase leading to Raja-Yoga ; and
through Raja-Yoga, the yogi becomes Dvandvatita in a higher sense praise and
blame, pleasure and pain, and all similar mental or intellectual and psychic opposites
becoming undifferentiated to him. Under Hatha-Yoga is classified Mantra- Yoga,
which, too, is preparatory to Raja-Yoga." Evans-Wentz, Milarepa, p. 134

Hatha, in Hatha-Yoga, is
popularly held to mean health ; but this
meaning
is merely secondary. In the Commentary on the Hatha-Yoga-Pradipika by Brahma-
nanda, the following shloka is
given to explain the meaning of Hatha (composed of
the two letters Ha and Tha) :
" '
The letter Ha means the Sun [svara] ;
the letter Tha [is] said [to mean]
the Moon [svara]. By the joining of Surya-Chandra (the Sun-Moon), Hatha-Yoga
is understood.'
"
According to this authority, Hatha in connection with Yoga means the Sun-
svara (or Sun-breathing), which refers to breathing yogically through the right (or
42
658 SYMBOLS AT WORK
sun) nostril, plus the Moon-svara (or Moon-breathing), which refers to breathing
yogically through the left (or moon) nostril. Taking yoga to mean '
to join/ Hatha-
Yoga thus means '
to join together the Sun-breathing and the Moon-breathing,' . . .
Ha = Surya
= Sun [breathing] is
positive ; Jha~ Chandra -Moon [breathing] is
nega-
tive. Hatha-Yoga, accordingly, primarily refers to the neutralization, by methods of
yoga, of the process of breathing, for, by the joining of a positive with a negative,
neutrality of the two results naturally." Ibid., p. 26
THE TRUE PATH
"
The True Path, as delineated here, is that pointed out in six verses of the Yoga-
Vasishtha (Nos. 17, 18, 19, 21 , 22 and 25 of Chapter XVII of the Upashamaprakarana).
These verses were originally selected by the Saint Ramana Swami of Tiruvannamalai
in South India among his disciples and admirers and through them to the world out-
side. Sometime ago they were published with a somewhat free rendering in English
from his Ashrama at Arunachalam. They are republished here with exact references
to the original text and a fuller interpretation than in the Arunachalam version."

By activity of Tao we are daily diminished,
diminished and yet more diminished,

By the practice of Inner Life stillness
we can continually conquer all things.
By the practice of returning to possessions,

THE ESOTERIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ZODIAC '
1. The Twelve Creative Hierarchies.
"
Around that wondrous Trimurti, we
see, standing in the light coming forth from Them, Those, the fruits of past universes,
who have won to that marvellous spiritual height ; and the next Forms that we
dimly glimpse, in the middle of the light, are of Those who are called the Seven.
, .
Every religion points to Them as standing round the manifested Trinity, forming
the Viceroys, as it were, of Ishvara in the vast Empire of the solar system, each one
with His own kingdom, each one administering His own department. We call Them
in Theosophy the Planetary Logoi, because these seven Spirits in the Sun have ever
been identified with the seven sacred planets which are Their physical bodies . . .
"
Round these again, in wider circle, there come the mighty Ones, the
Hierarchies that are the creative Hierarchies, or the Twelve Creative Orders, of the
universe. These are headed by the Twelve Great Gods, that appear in very ancient
stories, looming vast and magnificent from the great distance in which They dwell.
These are symbolized in the familiar Signs of the Zodiac, for the Zodiac is no modern
fancy, but was given to the Fourth Race of men by the mighty Teachers, and you
may read in your own records the names of some of these teachers, one of whom,
Asuramaya, is known as the first of the great astronomers ; it was he who gave the
Zodiacs to Egypt and to India. Those astronomical wheels are the symbols, the
pictures, in which the plan of the solar system is written, and in the traditions of the
past we find the clue to the labyrinth, and we realize why we are told that a planet
"
rules," or is the Lord of, one qf the Signs of the Zodiac. For the planet is the

Planetary Spirit, and His Sign of the Zodiac is one of the chief Creative Hierarchies,
containing within itself the remaining Hierarchies as sub-hierarchies, and these, under
His control and direction, build up His kingdom, and help the Monads in it to evolve.
. . . First comes the great Trinity ; round that Trinity the seven Spirits who are his
Viceroys in His universe ; around Them the twelve Creative Hierarchies, busy with
the work of the construction of the universe.
"
Now at the present stage of evolution, out of these twelve Creative
Hierarchies, five have passed away from the ken of even the greatest and most
developed Teachers of our world ; four of them have passed onward into liberation,
and one is
touching the threshold of liberation ; so that in our own evolution we
have now only to deal with seven." The Pedigree of Man, p. 8 et seq.
As Dr. Besant denominates the Tenth Creative Hierarchy as Makara which
stands for
"
Capricorn," the tenth Sign of the Zodiac, it would appear to indicate
that the Creative Hierarchies are to be taken in order when correlating with
the Zodiac, and that the "
four of them [who] have passed onward into liberation
"
are :
Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer, and that the Fifth which is
touching the
threshold of liberation is Leo, the Lion. Dr. Besant gives no description for the first
five, but T. Subba Rao says in
"
The Twelve Signs of the Zodiac
"
:
I. Creative Hierarchy T Aries: In Samskrit Mesfiam.

"One of the synonyms
of this word is
Aja . . . that which has no birth, and is
applied to the Eternal
Brahman in certain portions of the Upanishads. So the first sign is intended to
represent Parabrahman, the self-existent, eternal, self-sufficient cause of all."
In Modem Astrology : Aries is the adventurer, he who goeth forth first, the
Pioneer, [cosmic desire, the first of any cycle]. Aries is the Ram slain from the
foundations of the world. The sign is
equinoctial, cardinal, diurnal, movable, fiery,
choleric, hot, dry, and is the violent sign of the fiery triplicity. It is said to be ruled
by Mars. Its natural house is the first, O-30, that of the Ascendent, which
some say is more than the mere physical body, perhaps the Monad. The corre-
sponding parts of the body : head and face. We enter Aries on the 21st of March
at the time of the Vernal Equinox.
II. 8 Taurus: In Samskrit VrishabhamJ* "This word is used," says Subba
Rao,
"
in several places in the Upanishads and the Vedas to mean Pranava (Aum),
Shankaracharya has so interpreted it in several portions of his commentary."
In Modern Astrology : Taurus, the Bull, is the great Inert Mother [Space ?].
It is fixed, cold, dry, negative, and the first of the earthy triplicity. Its natural house
is the second, 30-60", ruling possessions and repose, peace, prosperity, gratitude ;

or self-indulgence, greed, idolatry ; throat and ears. Said to be ruled by Venus,
though some astrologers think by the Earth. We enter the sign of Taurus on the
20th of April.
III. n Gemini: In Samskrit M/tfiunam.' Subba Rao says :
"
As the word
plainly indicates, this sign is intended to represent the first androgyne, the
Ardhanarishvara,' the bi-sexual Sephira-Adam Kadmon."
In Modern Astrology : Gemini, the Twins, said to signify contraction and
expansion. Versatility. Also duality of positive-negative. It is a common sign,
first of the airy tnphcity, double-bodied and positive. Said to be ruled by Mercury. Its
natural house is the third, of brethren and contemporaries, 60-90, the field of ex-
pression, intellect and art, travelling ; neck, arms, shoulders, lungs. We enter the sign
of Gemini on the 20th of May.
IV. 03 Cancer : In Samskrit Karkatakam "
This sign ... is evidently in-
tended to represent the sacred Jetragram ; . . . the Pranava resolved into four
separate entities . . . the four states of Brahman . . . the four stages or conditions of
the sacred word. . . . This sign completes the first quaternary." [T Subba Rao].
In Modern Astrology : Cancer, the Crab, Memory, Imagination, Tenacity [the
memory of the Logos from which comes out Archetypal Ideation ?]. It is a watery and
cardinal sign, ruled by the Moon., [Is this, as Dr. Besant says, a blind for the earth ?]
Does Heaven bend over earth, as the sign indicates, in preparation for fructification ?
Its natural house is the fourth, 90-120, of parents and guardians, heredity, home,
fatherland ;
handicaps, racial and local prejudices. It controls the breast, stomach,
digestive organs. We enter the sign of Cancer on the 21st of June at the Summer
Solstice, when Heaven does indeed bend over earth.
Now an interesting point arises as to the placing of the next Hierarchy
in relation to the Zodiacal Signs. Either Leo, the Lion, is the First of the Seven,
which might appear from the description of
"
the Fiery Lions
"
etc., or Leo is
reflected so strongly into Virgo that it takes on the Leo aspect.
Does Subba Rao give us the clue when he says that
"
the next three signs are
not what they ought to be. Kanya or Virgo and Vriscikam or Scorpio should form one
single sign, and Tula [Libra] must follow the said sign ... a separation between
Kanya and Vriscikam was effected by interposing the sjgn Tula between the two."
In this case we would have had the Seven still with the earth :

rather than what might seem as the obvious ar-
rangement :
Virgo, Libra, Scorpio etc. The
descriptions given by Dr. Besant would seem to
uphold Subba Rao's contention.
V I.
(^ Leo [or Virgo] : In Samskrit Leo is S/'mham,
1
and of it T. Subba Rao
writes :
"
The sign is intended to represent the five Brahmas . . . the five
Buddhas." He also believes it to represent the
"
Jivatma."
Of the First Creative Hierarchy, Dr. Besant writes :
"
First comes the
Order that is
only descnbable by words connected with fire ,
Formless Fiery
Breaths, they are called, Lords of Fire, Divine Flames, Divine Fires, Fiery Lions, Lions
of Life : name after name, epithet after epithet, all
circling round the attribute of fire,
for They, it is written, are the Life and the Heart of the universe, the Atma, the
kosmic Will, and through Them comes the divine Ray of Paramatma, that awakens
Atma in the Monad of man."
The sign Leo in modern Astrology is said to be hot, dry, positive, and ruled
by the Sun. We enter into this Sign on the 22nd of July, Leo's natural house
is the fifth, 120- 150, and is said to control children, subjects, dependents, one's
standing in the community ; the generative powers, the loins, heart, and back.

"
Kanya
-means a virgin and represents Shakti or Mahamaya. The Sign in question is the sixth
Rashi or division and indicates that there are six primary forces in nature. . . .
"1. Parashakti :
Literally, the great or supreme force or power. It means
and includes the powers of light and heat.
"2. Jnanashakti :
Literally, the power of intellect or the power of real
wisdom or knowledge." It. includes the powers of association, clairvoyance and
psychometry.
"
3. Ichchashakti :
Literally, the power of the will. Its most ordinary mani-
festation is the generation of certain nerve-currents which set in motion such muscles
as are required for the accomplishment of the desired object.
"
4. Kriyashakti : The mysterious power of thought which enables it to pro-
duce external, perceptible, phenomenal result by its own inherent energy. The

ancients held that any idea will manifest itself externally if one's attention is deeply
concentrated upon it.
Similarly an intense volition will be followed by the desired
result. A Yogi generally performs his wonders by means of Ichchashakti and
Kriyashakti.
"5. Kundalinishakti :
Literally, the power or force which moves in a serpentine
or curved path. It is the universal life-principle which everywhere manifests itself in
nature. This force includes in itself the two great forces of attraction and repulsion.
Electricity and magnetism are but manifestations of it. This is the power or force
which brings about that
'
continuous adjustment of internal relations to external
relations
'
which is the essence of life according to Herbert Spencer, and that
'
continuous adjustment of external relations to internal relations,' which is the
basis of transmigration of souls or punarjanman (rebirth) according to the doctrines
of the ancient Hindu philosophers. A Yogi must thoroughly subjugate this power or
force before he can attain Moksham. This force is, in fact, the great serpent of
the Bible.
"
6. Mantrikashakti .
Literally, the force or power of letters or speech or
music. The whole of the ancient Mantra Shastra has this force or power in all its
manifestations for its subject-matter. The power of the Word which Jesus Christ
speaks of is a manifestation of this Shakti. The influence of music is one of its
ordinary manifestations. The power of the mirific ineffable name is the crown of
this Shakti." [T. Subba Rao.]
The Editor of The Jheosophist comments :
"
Even the very name of Kanya
(Virgin) shows how all the ancient esoteric systems agreed in ail their fundamental
doctrines. The Kabalists and the Hermetic philosophers call the Astral Light the
'
heavenly or celestial Virgin.' The Astral Light in its unity is the 7th. Hence the seven
principles diffused in every unity or the six and One two triangles and a crown."
In Modern Astrology : The Virgin [the immaculate sea of Virgin Force and
Matter] is
represented as mutable and the second of the earthy triplicity. A
cold, dry, negative sign. Its natural habitat is the sixth house, 150-180, that of
health and active service, and also concerns employers and employed.
It controls the bowels and solar plexus. Virgo is Craftsman and Critic, and is
said to be ruled by Mercury. As the feminine side of the now unleashed
Duality, it balances the masculine Scorpio through Libra. (See The Secret Doctrine,
III, 449 ;
Adyar ed., V, 430). The Sun enters Virgo on the 23rd of August.
Scorpio in Samskrit is Vriscikam.

Subba Rao says :
"
This sign is intended
to represent Vishnu . . .
literally . . . that which is
expanded as Vishvam
or Universe. Properly speaking Vishvam itself is Vishnu . . . The sign in question
properly signifies the universe in thought or the universe in the divine conception .
It is
properly placed as the sign opposite to Pranava. Analysis from Pranava

downwards leads to the universe of thought, and synthesis from the latter upwards
leads to Pranava (Aum) "... Tula or Libra represents the thirty-six Tattvams born of
Avidya . . ." It is the existence of these Tattvams that brings Hamsa into existence.
The elimination of these Tattvams marks the beginning of the synthesis towards
Pranava and Brahmam and converts Hamsa into Soham. As it is intended to
represent the different stages of creation from Brahmam downwards to the material
universe, the three signs Kanya, (the Virgin), Tula (Libra), and Vriscikam (Scorpio) are
.placed in the order in which they now stand as three separate signs."
In Modern Astrology :
Scorpio is
generally conceded to be the sign of sexual
regeneration. Said by most astrologers to be ruled by Mars, by some to be ruled
by Vulcan or even Pluto. The sign is fixed and the second of the watery triplicity ;
>it is cold, moist, negative. The house of Scorpio is the eighth, the field of disci-
pline, regeneration, liberation, or of destruction, degeneration, death. It is considered
as an occult house, and is 210-240. It controls the secret parts and the
generative system. We enter Scorpio on the 22nd of October.
Of the Second Creative Hierarchy still with us, which is either the dual Virgo-
Scorpio or Libra, Dr. Besant writes :
"
Below Them comes the second great Hierarchy, twofold in its nature,
the
'
twofold units,' Fire and Ether, manifested Reason, the Wisdom of the system,
that we speak of as kosmic Buddhi, that arouses Buddhi in the Monad of man."
VII III. ^ Libra : In Samskrit Tula represents
"
the thirty-six Tattvams born
of Avidya." See Scorpio above. It acts as the balance between Virgo and Scorpio
when they are separated. Ancient Hindu Astrology questions whether there
is a need for Libra when the balance has been restored by the reunion of Virgo
and Scorpio.
In Modern Astrology : Libra always represents Balance, Equilibrium. [Note the
difference in the type of balance as compared with the Heaven-bending-over-earth
Cancer <& : Libra's two lines are close =^ together, parallel.] Libra is cardinal, the
second of the airy triplicity, hot, moist, humane, positive. Controls veins and kidneys.
Its home is the seventh house, 180-2 10, that of partners and adversaries in the
field of balance and harmony, or opposition and discord. We enter Libra at the
time of the Autumnal Equinox, the 23rd of September.
Of the Third Creative Hierarchy still with us, which is either Libra or Scorpio,
-Dr. Besant writes :
"
Below Them again, the third, Mahat, or kosmic Manas,
'
the Triads,' Fire,
Ether, Water, the kosmic Activity, that will also bestow part of its essence on the
Monad of man as he descends.
"
These are the Arupa Creative Orders, dwelling in matter too subtle to
.assume a limiting form, matter in which all
'
forms
'
intermingle and inter-
penetrate."

IX IV. f Sagittarius : In Samskrit Dhanus. Subba Rao says :
"
When repre-
sented in numbers, the name is
equivalent to 9, and the division in question is the
ninth division counting from Mesham. The sign, therefore, clearly indicates the nine
Brahmas, the nine Prajapatis who assisted the Demiurgus irt
constructing the
material universe."
In Modern Astrology :
Sagittarius is the Archer, the Seeker after Truth, and is
ruled by Jupiter. It is the third of the fiery tnplicity, is mutable, hot, dry, positive.
Its house is the ninth, 240-270, the house of paternal influence, religion,
philosophy, law. We enter Sagittarius on the 22nd of November.
Of the Fourth Creative Hierarchy still with us, which is
probably Sagittarius,
the Truth-Seeker, the Archer, Dr. Besant writes :
"
Below these come the Rupa Creative Orders, and first of these, fourth
among the Hierarchies, is that which is ours, the Hierarchy of human Monads, not
yet having left the bosom of our Highest Father, wherein in truth we ever remain, in-
separable from him, although to us, in the mazes of matter, we seem to be utterly
separated and distinct. We can dimly glimpse them as they stand there in the glory of
their birth, with a
'
certain spiritual individuality,' it is written, which has become more
and more separate on the lower planes . . . these, called the Imperishable Jivas."

Capricorn or the Goat : In Samskrit Makaram l
or the Crocodile.
It is said by Subba Rao to stand for the dodecahedron shape of the material universe
in the mind of the Demiurgus.
In Modern Astrology : It is said of this sign that its
mysteries are known to
none save the Adept. The Goat ascending and descending the Mountain, obviously.
It is under the lordship of Saturn, and is
earthy and cardinal. Its house is the tenth,
270-300, and is called the House of Maternal Influence, (in Hindu Astrology that
of the Father also) it controls ambition, aspiration, attainment, a career. Saturn is
often the Mother in the horoscope. It controls the knees. We enter the sign of
Capricorn on the 21st of December at the time of the Winter Solstice, the real begin-
ning of the Heavenly Year when the Sun starts North in its Taking Period.
Of the Fifth Creative Hierarchy still with us : Dr. Besant definitely links this
with Makara, and reveals some of its mysteries :
41
It has for its symbol the pentagon ; in this the dual spiritual and the dual
physical aspects of nature appear, the positive and the negative, at war with each
other ; these are the turbulent, the
'
rebels
'
of many a mythos. Much shall we
hear of some of these presently, of those who are called the Asuras, born of the
first Body of Brahma, the Body which, cast off, became Darkness. A great host of
Beings in this Hierarchy have come from a past universe, and spring forth, full grown
as it were, from the Planetary Logos. These also seem to be called Asuras, but we
are specially concerned with those born from the Body of Darkness, and belonging
l = 5 or 5th Stage of Life which is Death.
ZODIAC 67 T
to this universe by their evolution. These are Beings of great spiritual power and
spiritual knowledge, but hide deep within themselves the germ, the essence, of
Ahamkara, of that l-makmg faculty which is
necessary for human evolution They
are the fruitage of the first planetary Chain . . . the fifth Hierarchy guides the
vibratory wave from the Will-aspect to the atmic atom, and the atmic atom, vibrating
to the Will-aspect, is called Atma."
XI VI. zz Aquarius: In Samskrit Kumbham. 1
Subba Rao writes : "When
represented by numbers, the word is
equivalent to 1 4. It can be easily perceived,
then, that the division in question is intended to represent the . . . fourteen
lokams."
In Modern Astrology :
Aquarius is the Water-Bearer, probably symbolical of the
carrying of Amrita or Immortality to Rama as did the Deva-God Hanuman. Most as-
trologers place it under the influence of Saturn ; some under the influence of Uranus.
Aquarius is hot, moist, rational, fixed, humane, diurnal sanguine, masculine, of the
airy triplicity, and rules the legs and ankles. It is to be found in the eleventh
house, 300-330, the house of friends and patrons, hopes, wishes, wills, aspirations
The Sun enters Aquarius on the 22nd of January.
Of the Sixth Creative Hierarchy still with us, probably Aquarius, Dr. Besant
writes :
"
The sixth of these great Hierarchies contains some that we can also
recognize, who are born of the Body of Brahma which is known as the Body of
Light, or of Day ; a group of Devas is seen, shining out amid this host of Devas with
especial glory, the Pitris of the Devas, who are known by the name of the
Agnishvattas, Those who are called the
'
sixfold Dhyanis
'
;
They give to man all but
the Atma and the physical body, and so are called the givers of the
'
five middle
human principles/ They guide the Monad in
obtaining the permanent atoms
connected with these principles, or the
'
fivefold plasm.' They are the fruitage
of the second planetary Chain This Hierarchy includes also great hosts of Devas,
the highest Nature Spirits, or Elementals of the Middle Kingdom."
H.P. B. says in The Secret Doctrine (II, 96, Adyar ed., Ill, 100) that
in a very especial way they are the heart of the Angelic Hierarchies and are linked
to the heart of man. It is
significant that the glyph of Aquarius is the mother sign.
XII VII. x P'sces: In Samskrit M/nam." Subba Rao writes :
"
This word
again is represented by 5 when written in numbers, and is evidently intended to
convey the idea of ... the five elements. The sign also suggests that water (not
the ordinary water, but the universal solvent of the ancient alchemists) is the most
important amongst the said elements."

672 SYMBOLS AT WORK
In Modern Astrology : Pisces is said to be the principle of solution. It is a
sign of balance, but as is evidenced from the glyph it is the balance of x pralaya or
stable equilibrium, rather than the balance indicated in the Libra sign, of unstable
equilibrium =*r. Older Astrology held that Pisces was under the influence of
Jupiter. Many astrologers today hold that it is under the rulership of Neptune.
The sign is mutable, third of the watery triplicity, cold, moist, double-bodied,
negative. Its house is the twelfth, that of spiritual development, hence
unification, purification, obedience, sorrow, suffering, bondage. It is a house of
occult tendencies. The Sun enters this house of 330-360 on the 20th of
February.
Of the Seventh Creative Hierarchy still with us, probably the Piscean Sign,
Dr. Besant writes :
"
The seventh Hierarchy contains those whom we know best under the name
of the Lunar Pitris, or the Barhishad Pitris, born of the Body of Brahma which is
called that of the Twilight, the Sandhya. They have to do with physical evolution,
as the Agnishvatta Pitris have to deal with the intellectual evolution of man . . .
Then, those we see crowding round them, belonging to their Hierarchy, are
their agents in the work that lies before them, vast hosts of Devas, the
lower Nature Spirits, or Elemental of the Lowest Kingdom, who will have to do
with the actual building of the body of man. And here too are the
'
spirits of
atoms,' the seeds of evolution in future kalpas, with which we have here nothing
to do."
"
They are sometimes called the Cubes, because on the lunar Chain they
conquered matter in its
quaternary, or fourfold form, and they brought that matter
with them for its further evolution in the Earth Chain." ibid., p. 45
"
Possessing the fourfold matter, and also the creative fire, they were able
to give to man his etheric double, prana, animal kama, and animal germ of mind.
Beyond this they could not go, but this sufficed for the shaping of physical evolution,
for the building of animal man and all lower forms.
"
These Pitris are spoken of as under the rule of Yama, the Lord of Death ;
he is called
'
Pitripati,' the Lord of the Pitris ; hence the bodies they give to man
are mortal ; born under the domination of the Lord of Change and of Death. They
cannot give the immortal ;
they can only give the mortal, under the dominance of
the Lord of Death. Men are their progeny, and must therefore form part of
Death's kingdom ; and thus the children of Earth differ from the children of Buddha,
the planet Mercury, for his men are immortal, whereas the children of Earth are
mortal. Moreover, these Pitris themselves will evolve by their work on the terrene
Chain, and they will escape from the domination of the Lord of Death by this
evolution, and in the next planetary Chain, the fifth, they will
play the part of
Manasaputras, Sons of Mind and Lords of Death." ibid., p. 48

Therefore, one might hold that the sign changed from life to life, marked
the ideal of the given life, and the future towards which the Self was at least
immediately striving.
Therefore, it is said that one has only the virtues of one's Sun-sign.
The Moon-sign has properly been called the mark of the personality.
It indicates the place one stands in one's evolution, and probably indicates the
lesson most immediately learned in the past, or that which is in process of being
assimilated. Therefore, it is said that one has both the virtues and faults of one's
Moon-sign in flux.
The Ascendant may have more significance than is
commonly attached to
it. All agree that it marks the sign of the physical body and that it has tremendous
influence upon the person.
Theosophy teaches that the physical permanent atom does not change but
is of a set of seven chosen by our Monad in the beginning, or rather guided to him
to express himself. If this Ascendant sign really marks the physical body, may it
not also give us some indication of our Monadic temperament ? In other words, do
we change our Ascendant from life to life ? Perhaps we may be born always at that
time of day when our Ascendant is
rising. Some Occultists have said that the
physical body is
fairly recognizable from life to life in appearance even when it
changes sex and race. A. H, P,
THE SYMBOLS AND THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC : SOME SUGGESTIONS
The ancient Hindu Zodiac and the Egyptian Zodiac of Denderah begin with
the sign Aquarius, and this alone fits the symbols spoken of in Symbolic Yoga.
Western astrology considers the Zodiac as only beginning with Aries, and though
this is correct for our Humanity in its manifestation, it does not take account of the
pre-genetic period (which is also an inter-period between two cycles), which
may be cosmic activity preceding any manifestation
"
down here." Before any
manifestation is the Point or Seed, and Aries as a sign of manifestation has its
Point in a cosmic pre-cycle ; at the same time Aries is itself a Seed of another cycle
still spiritual
to us.
There are three cycles interpenetrating and overlapping ;
they are called in
these notes :
(i)
The Cosmic Cycle ;
(ii)
The Spiritual Archetypal Cycle ;
(iii)
The
Human (Psycho-physical) Cycle.
" Human
"
here stands for Man as used
throughout Symbolic Yoga ; i.e., that all Life is the Life of Man with its three
divisions supermanhood ;
man as we know him ; and man in the becoming
(including mineral, vegetable and animal life).
Connected with both the first and last symbols is the astrological sign
Capricorn, for it represents the fruits of the Cycle the Lotus Flower being handed
676 SYMBOLS AT WORK
on to Aquarius as the Seed for the new future cycle. (This activity is
explained in
the following pages.)
A Table of Correspondences between the Symbols and the Signs of the
Zodiac is attached (page 677).
AQUARIUS
The Point or the Seed Aquarius connected also with Capricorn and Pisces.
The Indian name for this sign is Kumbha, which means literally
"
a vase
"
and
also a "measure of grain." The root of this name Kubh or Kumbh means a
"
thing curved on itself." So that Kumbha-Aquarius signifies the vase containing
within itself the Grain (or Seed) of Life alternatively expressed as the Waters
of Life. The western symbol of the man with the jar from which water is poured
out is thus derived from eastern knowledge.
The previous sign to this, Capricorn, gathers up the fruit of the active cycle
just preceding it. All ancient peoples saw in the Zodiac a symbol of the Divine
Creative Hierarchies, and for them the solar zodiacal cycle was a representation of
the Cosmic Cycle and indeed all cycles, large and small. The Sun enters Capricorn
at the close of the year's active cycle of growth, when Nature having harvested the
fruits of that growth
"
rested," but also re-prepared herself during the two winter
months when the Sun was in Aquarius and Pisces. These months formed the
Paralaya in Nature's season, and thus were the representation of a corresponding
period in the Cosmos. Capricorn represents the classification of the fruits of the
closing cycle. In the West it is
symbolized by a climbing goat (sometimes with a
fish-tail), and in the East by a crocodile creature (Makara). All that has achieved its
goal in the last cycle is carried to the spiritual heights by the climbing goat, or the
breath of the crocodile ; that which has still some experiences to complete passes
into the waters of matter with the fish-tail, or the aquatic crocodile.
Kumbha-Aquarius is the spiral of the cycle turned on itself as suggested
in the root Kubh, thus constituting a vase wherein the achieving Life waits for a time
suspended, transcendent between two cycles of manifestation ; the post-evolutive
and pre-evolutive phase of the Spirit floating on the Waters Vishnu (who prevades
all things) seated on his Lotus. During suspension between the cycles, the vase
remains upright holding the Seed without communication with matter, while inner
sustenance and digestion are going on in preparation for the new cycle.
1
When manifestation is to to take place again,
"
when the Ascent to the
Highest is made before a new birth
"
(universal or human), the vase is reversed
turned mouth-downward and its Waters or Seeds (Life or Consciousness in ail its
degrees) pour out into matter and animate its forms.

The planets (or rather the aspects of the Creative Hierarchy embodied in
the planets), which are said in traditional astrology to
"
govern
"
the signs, tell
the same tale. Capricorn is
"
governed
"
by Saturn, and Aquarius by Saturn
and Uranus.
Uranus (Ouranos of the Greeks and Varuna of the Indians) represents In-
finite Eternity and Free Unbound Space :
"
Uranus is a modified Varuna, the
'
universal encompasser
'
the '
all-
embracer "... Space, the maker of Heaven and Earth [Father-Mother] since
both are manifested out of his (or its) seed."

The hieroglyph of Uranus ( $ ) represents the Father-Mother aspect (l l) but
as yet unman/fest and unseparated.
"
The higher gods of antiquity . . . the
Logoi ... in their origin were represented as male-female
"
bi-sexual,
hermaphrodite.
2
The & part of $ remaining when 1 1 has been detached, signifies the Seed
with all its
potential growth contained within itself. But according to mythology
and its symbolism, Kronos (Saturn) emasculates his father Uranus and throws his
Seed into the Ocean, which breaking on the farther shore in waves and foam gives
birth to the beauty of manifested form in Aphrodite. The Secret Doctrine
(II, 281 ;
Adyar ed., Ill, 271) tells us that this emasculation means that the creative
and generative power of Uranus passes to Kronos who is Time Lord of all Cycles,
for he cuts them with his scythe, thus determining their period and he has united
himself with Rhea (Matter in general).

1? represents the Father \$
limited by and in His Son for the purposes
of manifestation.
The hieroglyph of Saturn shows the Seed of Uranus opening outward and
downward into manifestation, w'z., $ becomes I?. Here is the twofold aspect of
the Point or Seed contained in this symbol. The consummation of God is
$ , the
vase upright ; the forthgoing of God is Saturn, I? .
Surely it is when the Ascent to the Highest is made that the astrological
rulership of Uranus over Aquarius passes to Saturn, and the vase of Water or Grain
is reversed towards Earth, the contents poured out and mingled with (yet also
carried over at right angles to itself) the waters of manifestation of Pisces, reach-
ing the "
farther shore
"
where manifestation takes place.
It will be noted that the Hieroglyph of Uranus contains all the symbols
within it, as well as signifying the Seed. Father-Mother, the Circle, the Cross are
all included in
Jg , but so to speak in synthesis and undifferentiated. It is not till
Saturn opens the Seed and leads it down into manifestation that the other symbols

appear in their order in consecutive human time. Saturn is indeed the
"
grace and
magic of Time within Infinite Eternity."
PISCES
The Web-Womb in the Cosmic Cycle.
Pisces has always been considered a sign
"
not of the earth, earthy
"
in its
nature. Neptune, the planet
"
ruling
"
Pisces, has been represented as the Ark carrying
the Seed of a new cycle over the Piscean waters (see The Secret Doctrine), those
waters being the Cosmic Waters or Akasha. Pisces therefore becomes the Universal
Matrix concealing and preserving the germs of Life during Pra/aya or the period
preceding manifestation. The symbol of the Fish with which it is associated, and which
live in its waters, is connected with Spiritual Saviours in ail
religions and mythologies.
ARIES
The Vertical Line in the Cosmic Cycle. The Seed in the Archetypal
Spiritual Cycle.
For the Cosmic Cycle this is the vertical Line down-dropped by the Maha-
yogi Shiva the Pillar of Fire of which neither the apex nor the base could be
reached. It is also represented in His Son, the Hindu Gharma-ja (born without the
intervention of woman) put forth from Himself. Therefore, while it is the vertical
Line cosmically, it is also the Seed when viewed from the second interacting cycle
which I have called the Archetypal Spiritual Cycle. Gharma-ja is a martial figure,
the term martial comprising a conception far grander than that of only a God of
war ; for Mars is the messenger and reminder to us of Kingship our Kingship as
creators on all planes of Life. Gharma-ja is well represented in the martial
sign Aries.
All religions and mythologies give that Truth (in allegorical form) of the great
divine gesture and sacrifice which ensures our becoming ultimately
"
as our Father
which art in Heaven
"
; the linking by divine intervention of the animal Humanity
to its own transcendent Divinity, so that Divinity shall henceforth be inherent within
it, and Humanity shall be in essence spiritual. That is the Cosmic Vertical Line put
forth and becoming simultaneously the Seed of our Archetypal Spiritual Lite. The
changes it
brought to the early Races of Humanity are symbolically told in the Hindu
story of Daksha, whose cycle of rule Shiva closed when He gave him a goat's head
(the goat of Capricorn at the close of a cycle see section on Capricorn later), or
as some say, a ram's head significant of his reincarnation in the new Archetypal
Cycle beginning with Aries.
It is now that Shiva the Great Ascetic becomes Shiva-Nilalohita the Kumdra,
and we have the Seed of the Kumra dynasty, the beginning of a New Time when
the King and His Brothers took up their abode in Shamballa and Humanity's spiritual
Seed was assured.
680 SYMBOLS AT WORK
TAURUS
The C/rc/2 and the Horizontal Line in the Cosmic Cycle. The Web-Womb
in the Archetypal Spiritual Cycle.
One might say that Taurus represents Shamballa itself ; the Circle, the Sea
and the horizontal expanse of that Sea for the Cosmic Mahayogi Shiva Himself,
but in which His Kumaric expression of Himself abides, sheltering and fecundating,
within the Spiritual City as in a Web-Womb, the Spiritual Seed of His archetypal
growth-plan for us.
Taurus is associated with the Egg of Leda and the Egg of the World (see
The Secret Doctrine), and it is also
"
ruled
"
astrologically by Venus, the Spiritual
Mother of the Earth, from whom came the Lords of the Flame, or the Kumaras,
according to the Archaic Records. She is also associated with the Hindu Vach,
the Norse Audhumla, and all other mythical divine Cows givers of nourishment and
life to mankind.
GEMINI
The Cross in the Cosmic Cycle. The Vertical Line in the Archetypal Spiritual
Cycle. The Seed in the Human Cycle.
The duality of the sign 'Gemini is
apparent in all the three symbols with which
I have connected it. In the Cosmic Cycle the positive force is
already at right
angles to the negative force ; it is the plane of the Eternal Circle of Boundless Time
on which "
lie crossways all the Gods, creatures and creations born in Space and
Time," for all those creations represent the pulsating vertical Line of the Cosmos
acting on and in the Cosmic Sea.
For the Archetypal Spiritual Cycle, Gemini represents the Rod or vertical
Line itself. It is this Archetypal Gemini which is
pictured in the Zodiac that joins the
Gemini twins, feet to feet, with one head upward (positive pole of the Rod) and
one head downward (negative pole). It is also represented in the more active
mythical symbolism of the journeys of the All-Father Odin from Asgard, the
Gods' Home, to Midgard, the Home of Men, from Heaven to Earth, over the
Bridge Bifrost.
For the Human Cycle, it is here (and as the result of the activity of the
Cosmic Cross and the Archetypal Rod) that twofold man is born. It is here that
the gift of the Kumaras offered in the Archetypal Seed in Aries becomes manifest
in form in the Seed on earth. Man as we now know him is both divine and animal
a duality reflected in his psycho-physical nature and in the dual sexes ; the heavenly
immortal twin and the earthly mortal twin Castor and Pollux, Hermes and Hercules,
and in the Babylonian epic Gilgamesh (two-thirds divine) and Enkidu, his
"
natural
"
animal-man prototype and twin
ZODIAC 681
CANCER
The Churning of the Svastika in the Cosmic Cycle (commencement of this).
Jhe Circle and Horizontal Line in the Archetypal Spiritual Cycle. The Web-Womb in
the Human Cycle.
Since the Yoga of the Cosmic Mahayogi has now borne fruit (or Seed) in
both the Archetypal and Human Cycles, all is now set for action and interaction from
the standpoint of the Cosmic Cycle, and Cancer represents cosmically the com-
mencement of the Churning of the Svastika, which will continue for all the time
that the Archetypal and Human Cycles are fulfilling each their destiny within the
larger preceding cycle.
For the Archetypal Cycle, Cancer represents the Circle drawn out of the
flashing electric energies of the Rod with two poles represented in Gemini, Here
also is the Archetypal Horizontal Line, i.e., the activity of the Vertical Rod express-
ed laterally ; his powers invested in channels spreading laterally from him within
his field of expression, (just as happened for the Cosmic Vertical Rod when ex-
pressed in Taurus). Here, again, traditional astrology links the old mythologies with
the symbols. Astrology says that Jupiter is
"
exalted
"
(i.e.,
finds his best expression)
in Cancer, and mythology tells us that just as Saturn (Time) emasculated his Father
Uranus, so did Jupiter emasculate Saturn. Following the suggestion of The Secret
Doctrine here as before, and reading this emasculation as Creative Powers passed
on, we have now those Powers brought down into manifestation a little further.
When "
Saturn usurps
"
the creative power of his Father and determines a
cycle of time (the Archetypal Cycle) wherein it shall be limited he is really
working as a magnet attracting from out of the Boundless Space of his Father's
kingdom certain factors only for his cycle of manifestation, factors in accord
with the Law of Karma. Within Saturn's cycle of Time, his son Jupiter rules. (Zeus
is the ruler of the Greek Pantheon of the Gods or Creative Powers, after having
despoiled his Father.) Apparently Jupiter is thus all-powerful, but it is only within
the Time-cycle of his Father. Nevertheless, for us he does indeed rule, and in this
field of expression which is
represented in Cancer, Jupiter or Zeus Pitar (Zeus our
Father) is in his
"
exaltation." In Hindu mythology also it is Vishnu (Jupiter) who is
the Fish that guides the Ark with the Souls or Men of the Vaivasvata Races.
Not only in the symbols but in the mythological Gods or Powers there is the
law of the Silent Watcher. Uranus is the Silent Watcher as well as the Father of
Saturn, and it is out of the materials of and within his kingdom alone that Saturn can
work ; similarly Saturn is the Silent Watcher and Father of Jupiter who cannot rule or
act beyond the confines of his Father's self-chosen cycle.
For the Human Cycle, Cancer is the Web-Womb, the home and mother-
aspect of traditional astrology. Just as Taurus, the Archetypal Web-Womb, was
"
ruled
"
by Venus, the spiritual Mother of the Earth, so is Cancer, the Human.
682 SYMBOLS AT WORK
Web-Womb, "
ruled
"
by the Moon, the physical Mother of the Earth. The Greeks
spoke of Cancer as the Gate of the Souls (Homer and Porphyry), i.e., where they
came through to take birth in forms, arriving mythically in a boat, which was the Ark
of the Hindu myth which Vishnu guided.
In the hieroglyph of Cancer, we have the dual lines curved on themselves
and enclosing a space thus <g> ,
perhaps representing the Cosmic interaction
giving the Sea or Field of the Archetypal Cycle, and at the same time the Web-
Womb of the Human Cycle.
LEO
The Churning of the Svastika in the Cosmic Cycle (continued). The Cross in
the Archetypal Spiritual Cycle. The Vertical Line in the Human Cycle.
Cosmically, the Churning of the Svastika is continued from the signs Cancer
to Scorpio since, as we have said, the gradual growth of the Archetypal Cycle
from Seed to Flower is due to and forms the activity (the Churning) of the
Cosmic Cycle.
For the Archetypal Cycle, Leo represents the Cross, the expressive urge or
impulse (and that Leo is said astrologically to represent) of the vertical Line on the
.'horizontal Line.
Leo is
"
ruled
"
astroJogically by the Sun, and the
"
crucifixion
"
of the Sun
pictured in many mythologies is
repeated here, it must not be forgotten that the
Cosmic Gods have already met their Cross in Gemini ; now at this stage, the
Archetypal Gods (our Fathers) also have a responsibility towards us. The Seed
of the Human Cycle was put forth from their vertical Line in Gemini, and has
become fecundated in the Human Web-Womb of Cancer, but the Birth or manifest-
ation has yet to come, hence just as the Cosmic Gods "
sacrificed themselves to
themselves
"
in Gemini, so do the Archetypal Gods here. It is told in Norse
mythology how Odin (All-Father) hung self-wounded on Yggdrasil, the World-Tree
(which is indeed the Cross of the Archetypal Gods), and "
to Odin offered, Myself
to myself" before He could obtain the Wisdom which enabled Him of the divine
Trinity to guide His children Men.
For the Human Cycle, Leo is the vertical Line ; it is
interesting that Leo's
"
ruler," the Sun, which is identified with the Sacrificer for the Archetypal Gods, should
indeed be also Our Lord the Sun since he is the vertical Line for the Human Cycle.
VIRGO
The Churning of the Svastika in the Cosmic Cycle (continued). The Churning
of the Svastika in the Archetypal Spiritual Cycle (begun). The Circle and Horizontal
Line in the Human Cycle.
There is no need to refer further here to the active Churning of the Cosmic
Cycle which is
continuing.
2ODIAC 683
For the Archetypal Cycle also the Churning of the Svastika has now com-
menced. The vertical Line of the Human Cycle has been "
born
"
in the last sign,
so its interaction in its Circle is now the Churning for the Archetypal Cycle, just as
is the case in the relationship between the Archetypes and the Cosmos in the series
of signs from Cancer to Scorpio. The Secret Doctrine tells us that originally the
signs Virgo and Scorpio were one sign, and that Libra was only a potentiality not
yet manifest. The later separation of the signs with the Balance of Libra interposed
between them is connected with the Coming of the Lords of the Flame (who are
the Kumaras, our Fathers) from Venus with the spiritual gift of Mind, and hence
the knowledge of Good and Evil ; and the Churning of Their Svastika ensures the
activity of their children Men in their smaller cycle of experience until for them
-also the Svastika shall churn. The "
ruler
"
of Virgo is Mercury, but here his
duality (expressed differently in his other sign Gemini) is resolved into the Divine
Hermaphrodites (the Kumaras) in the Archetypal Cycle itself ;
but in the Human
Cycle for which Virgo is
only the Circle and horizontal Line we have that
expression only as the Innocent Hermaphrodites of the Golden Age Adam-Eve
ibefore the eating of the fruit of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. That is
repre-
sented in the hieroglyph for Virgo (n#) signifying Life with its creative powers
turned on and in itself, not yet consciously wielded. Here then, for the Human
Cycle, is the field or sea for experience from the Immaculate Virgin of Wisdom to
rbecome the Knowledge and Experience of Wisdom.
LIBRA
The Churning of the Svastika in the Cosmic Cycle \ the Churning of the
Svastika in the Archetypal Cycle (both continuing). The Cross in the Human Cycle.
Libra for Humanity is the sign of the Balance that is the balance between its
duality, in other words, the Cross, for there will be no balance until the vertical Rod
of the Ego has exerted the energy of its electric poles to form and control its
horizontal environment. It will not be by multiplying the number of experiences
within the Circle that is, by continuing in perpetual activity along the horizontal
tine that mastery and ultimately Kingship is reached ; but by distilling the essence
from the lateral or horizontal field by the assertion of the vertical Line upon it.
That is what is
signified for us in the Balance of Libra. It is another sign
"
ruled
"
>by Venus, from whom came our Lords, Givers of our Archetypes, and also
the King of the World, and it is Their activities and Churning that
"
produced
"
the
sign Libra, as an activity out of mere potentiality, to guide us to the way of
attaining our Kingship.
The next sign will bring us to our Churning of the Svastika, and it is as well
to remember here that since all
cycles are from and within each other, Saturn,
{Shiva, the Mahayogi of the Cosmic Cycle), presides at this new step within His
684 SYMBOLS AT WORK
Cycle of Time ;
and so in the Balance between Virgo and Scorpio that is, in the
sign Libra we find the
"
exaltation
"
or best expression of Saturn according to
traditional astrology, which retains much of the old Truth but does not today
recognize its spiritual roots.
SCORPIO
The Churning of the Svastika for All Cycles.
The Human Cycle is now reflecting and experiencing the same quality of
activity as the other two cycles. With the knowledge of Good and Evil, the creative
force of Life in humanity was led outwards and downwards into manifestation and
matter, represented in the hieroglyph of Scorpio ^ where the
"
tail
"
of Virgo is
now seeking expression, in the martial, passionate but powerful sign Scorpio. This
is the final result of the gift of Mind, and its reflection in the psycho-physicafc
separation of the sexes. The other form of the Scorpio hieroglyph ity
shows the
regeneration and rebirth to a creative power which is as pure as in the Golden Age,
but will be wielded now in self-consciousness, and with the spiritual power that the
Archetypal Cycle has pictured for us and destined us to attain.
(A point here occurs to me in connection with the Dance and with Healing.
Is it
possible that the connection will be found in the Churning of the Svastika, which
is of course in its very motion creative, and also one very potent aspect of the
Dance ? If there is
any connection here, it is
interesting that traditional astrology
connects Virgo with Health and Healing, and Scorpio with Doctors and Surgeons.)
SAGITTARIUS
The Flowering of the Lotus for All Cycles.
The representation of Sagittarius the man with the bow shooting the arrow
of his achievements upwards in his aspiration is
surely representative also of the
Flowering of the Lotus or at least the Bud. Jupiter
"
governs
"
Sagittarius astrolog-
ically speaking ; thus the Man who entered into the Web-Womb in Cancer, where
Jupiter is
"
exalted
"
or enthroned within his Father's Time-Cycle, reaches in Sagit-
tarius to some extent towards the achievement of the Archetypal King, and attains
his Kingship or Flowering, and with that attainment comes simultaneously the final
attainment of the Archetypal and Cosmic Gods as well. For our Fathers of the
Archetypal Cycle in putting forth a Line from Themselves, that became the Seed of
the Divinity within us, accepted the responsibility of Their Men-children, and must
await the attainment of all before Their own attainment can be crowned. In the
same way, Shiva, the Mahayogi of the Cosmic Cycle, accepted the responsibility of
the whole Archetypal Cycle and its Workers when He identified Himself with it as
the Great Kumara, and only when it has flowered bearing within it our Human.
ZODIAC 685
Flower also can His Flower blossom forth in all its
beauty and His Yoga be
complete
CAPRICORN
The End of All Cycles.
And so in Capricorn, since all the cycles are complete, Shiva-Saturn cuts the
flower and fruit of achievement of all the cycles together, coiling them up, so to
speak, with the fruits enclosed within them so that He thus becomes once
again ( ) instead of (
V ), and so He returns to His Father Uranus, ascending to the
heights again and once more in the Unmanifest there is Father-Mother-Son undif-
ferentiated the vase holding the Seed from this latest fruit in suspension above
manifestation until the next Triple Cycle ;
$ the consummation or consecration
before the next period of forthgoing.
Saturn being once more with His Father, the Universal Yoga of Shiva has
been completed, and within it all the Yogas of all forms of Life enclosed and
enthroned within the cycle of Time have been achieved.

A DISCOURSE TO THE SPIRITS IN PRISON '
BY A BREAKER OF FETTERS
My Brothers,
At this great moment, as you see how light must ever
penetrate and triumph over darkness, as you see a Son of the
Light once more an inevitable victor over fleeting shadows, I exhort
you, out of the love you have watched me use against you, out
of the power of the King which is its irresistible form, to cast
away your darkness and enter into the Light your true home,
wanderers from it
though you have been for long ages. I
speak
to you, as well you know, in the name of the Lord of Light and
Life and Glory, whose consecrated Messenger I am, whose Star
I wear in sign of my authority.
Know, my brothers, that on your present road you cannot
ultimately prevail, for it leads but backwards till once again you find
the Road of Light. At the utmost you can but retard, and as
time passes even this power wanes. Look back upon your pathway,
and you cannot but observe how little by little the struggle moves
to your ever-increasing disadvantage. Be not blind and foolish.
Cease to deceive yourselves, for the longer you continue to walk
in the shadows of your own creation, the ruder the awakening into
the Light. Look with me down the vistas of the past. Observe
with me your so-called victories. Do you see them now ? What
are even the best of them, those in which I see you take most
pride, but short-lived, not one single one of them preventing our
Lords of Love and Wisdom and Compassion from drawing nearer
and nearer to them the children of the Fire, to which race, my
brothers, you too belong though you would deny your origin.
In terms of time you may here and there have won a fleeting
retardation, at a price to yourselves far beyond the length of

permitted to allow you to do , has any one of them look, my
brothers, look even for a moment ruffled the deep calm waters
of Eternity as they pursue their way in divine relentlessness upon
their appointed course ? Ah !
yes. You now see of what nature
is
your futility. Know, then, it is not too late to change.
Cease, brothers, to be the slaves we know you to be, though
you think yourselves kings in your self-created delusion. You
cannot make an Eternity out of the time-shadows of your own
creation. You cannot stay time, be your power what it
may,
for time is the servant of Eternity and moves but in accordance
with the Eternal Laws, to which you give such unwilling allegiance,
fulfilling as you imagine you are breaking. Eternity is outside your
grasp, but you are within its
all-embracing dominion. Look within
yourselves. Is not Eternity the heart even of your being ? How
seek you to fashion out of it its own negation
'
My hands are outstretched to you, my brothers, clasp them
and let me draw you close to me out of your darkness, brother-
children of the Fire, brother-sparks from out the mighty Mother-
Flame. You are not water that you can either quench the sparks
in others or extinguish them the essence of your being in
yourselves. As we are, so are you. In you is the radiance you
see me embody. Become what you are. Two thousand years
ago you killed the body taken as a habitation by the Lord of Love.
What have you profited, blind servants of a Shade ? Has not that
very death become the call to Life Eternal to millions of your
fellow-children of the Fire ? The almighty power of Love fashions
channels for its outpouring even from the very forces hatred its
dark shadow hurls against it ; for hatred is no more than a dis-
tortion of that all-pervading Love, which ever knows how to
straighten these distortions of its
being. Resistless is the stream of
the Love of God, and it shall sweep you back into itself, for you
are of Love, my brothers, and must of your natures share in, yea,
contribute to, its irresistible power and unstaying growth. Open
your eyes as I touch them with the wand of vision. Perceive now
the goal before you, towards which your footsteps must ever
be directed, though you walk as drunken men walk home.
My brothers, I have no glory in my triumph, save a glory
which I would have you share. I
triumph for your good, in your

service, as much as for the causes I am appointed to guard.
Somewhere, somehow, as I
perceive, though you may perceive
it not, you are rejoicing because I am winning you from your
thraldom. Somewhere I see you know that I am not your enemy,
but your friend and brother, steadfast comrade on the path of Life
and Light. Take these outstretched hands. We will walk together,
brothers, and I will lead you, as is
permitted to me, to the blessed
Feet of the All-Compassionate, who rejoiceth more over one
sheep that has strayed from His fold, yet returns to it at nightfall,
than over those that have safely remained within its protection.
You are His sheep, He is
your Shepherd the Shepherd ever
mindful of His flock, who watcheth by night and by day in equal
tenderness over all. I see you shrink. Have no fear that you
cannot, dare not, face your Shepherd. Are you not His ? And
does He not know His own ? I
say to you that over your dark
cold nakedness He will cast the sheltering mantle of His infinite
Understanding, and you shall know a peace and a rest that have
not been yours for ages. Do homage, my brothers, to your
own inner eternal light, and it shall shine upon your true pathway,
Together let us break your fetters, so that you may be free to
climb again, with me, your battle-friend, by your side.
Hark, my brothers, to the clashing discords of your being ;
are they not beginning slowly to die away into the distance ? Are
not the musics of your essential harmonies slowly but surely
reawakening in unfoldment to an inevitable triumph of achieve-
ment ? Today shall the suns of your natures rise again to dispel
your darkness. Already you feel the warmth of their glow. Already
you perceive the early rays of their radiant light, the soft, young
renewal of the eternal certainty of a majestic and glorious future.
Look not back into the night. Look forward into the Light,
and all shall be well. Pain and suffering must be yours, for
through you it has come to others. But I shall be with you to
remind you that every agony the Law demands from you is a
release towards the Light, and in the reapings of the terrible
lonelinesses you have caused to others, in the reapings of the
misery, sorrow, despair, which you have sown in others, yet shall
you hear faintly sounded the note of an eventual peace, so be it
that now you allow to enter into your hearts that ray of our
Blessed Lord's Compassion which in His Great Name, I, a Ruler
in His Church, send forth towards you, bidding you give it a

dwelling-place in your sad, cold hearts. A brother knocks lovingly
at your doors, shall all within be still and silent ? I
say to you,
my brothers, come from your death into His Life. Come forth
from your imprisonment into His Freedom. The blessing of the
Great Brotherhood of the Light be upon you, weary wayfarers
who have lost your way, that you may die out of falsehood into
truth, that you may enter upon that karma of suffering which
shall transmute the force of your hatred into a mighty power of
love. There shall be no agony without the courage to bear it
Come forth then, my brothers. Come with me to Him who waits
for you with the longing tenderness of the Father for loved
children, who for a time have gone forth from their true home
into an outer darkness, but without whose return into the house
of their Father His happiness must remain incomplete. Come,
my brothers, come
THE MASTER ASCENDED
NATURE'S ASSENT TO THE FiFTH INITIATION
BY "A WATCHER"
All Nature must
give Assent to
the Ascension
A Triumphal
Progress is
made through
each Kingdom
in turn
The setting for the Fifth of the Great Initiations seems to be
in the nature of a magnificent Assent on the part of the Kingdoms
of Nature of which the candidate has so far been a member, from
the earliest right up to the Human Kingdom itself. Each Kingdom
in turn seems to bear witness to the candidate's possession of the
fruits of such Kingdom, and proclaim him to be gotrabhu (" ready
"
for the next Initiation). It would seem also that such fruits, even
in the case of the earlier Kingdoms, are by no means garnered in
their fullness, in their completion, until the individual is on the
threshold of this supreme step, which marks his transition from
microcosmic to macrocosmic evolution It is as if the candidate
makes a triumphal progress through each Kingdom of Nature in
turn, or attunes his consciousness in turn to the full consciousness
of each Kingdom, with Elder Brethren as witnesses, recorders, com-
panions. As he passes through each Kingdom, the homage of
that Kingdom is
gloriously accorded to him, and in that homage is
the power which effects those changes in the individual which mark
him ready for the great Ascension. Each constituent member of
each Kingdom acclaims him, renders him homage, sings out to him
its heart's song of gratitude and at-one-ment, so that great surges
of triumphant music ring round and through him, to which his own-
nature instantly responds in stupendous accord and unison ; the
music within blending in utter harmony with the music without
unassailable witness to a kingship of the Kingdom which the candi-
date has at last and for ever achieved.

In that sublime Act of Unity, candidate and Kingdoms move a
stage onward, draw a step nearer to the individual goal. The
candidate ascends into Heaven, dwells in Heaven-consciousness,
and every single denizen of each Kingdom moves onward under
the Law of the Unity of all Life. Not a single denizen is excluded
from participation in the Act of At-one-ment, for Initiation is no
less universal than individual, an expansion of consciousness is no
less for all than for the one. The Triumph of one is a triumph for
each and for all. The burden for each has become substantially
less, the happiness for each substantially greater. And in the
festive rejoicing the whole world, indeed the whole universe,
shares.
As the candidate passes through Kingdom after Kingdom, the
rejoicing becomes ever more and more vocal, more conscious, his
progress ever more and more triumphant, until as the Assent of
the Human Kingdom dies away from vibrant glory into soft mur-
muring, the candidate becomes literally transformed into a mighty
ascending Fire, a veritable Pillar of Fire, irradiating Life with
majestic pulsations of Eternal Being. And the beauty of the
triumph lies not merely in the fact that in each Kingdom he is a
living and compelling witness to the certainty of a glory to come
for each and every member of each and every Kingdom an out-
ward and visible sign of an omnipresent certainty but it lies even
more in the fact that the kingship he has attained remains in each
Kingdom as an eternal source of Power upon which each denizen
is free to draw. A Master is a reservoir, a new spiritual account,
an added power, on which all
Kingdoms are at liberty to draw ;
and the Master knows indeed is it marvellous knowledge that to
Him, among Others, turn constantly all forms of all Life for their
increasing vitalization, so that part of His mighty meditation con-
sists in being ever open, ever alert, to the constant call of every
stone, of every piece of rock, of every crumb of earth, of every
blade of grass, of every drop of water, of every tree and flower
and shrub, of every moving creature, for Life. There is for
the Master a new and wondrous intimacy with all manifested
Life, a personal intimacy. With every calling thing He has His
personal link, and all things call ; and to every call He gives
the answer of the Master, the answer of the soul triumph-
ant, Life.

As he passes through Kingdom after Kingdom, in wondrous
way is each Kingdom literally drawn into him, does he pervade
each Kingdom, and there is a great unification of consciousness.
Each Kingdom and he are one for ever. So entry upon this fifth
great stage demands complete transcendence of all separateness
that could exclude aught of any Kingdom. When naught in
any
Kingdom is
perceived but as comrade and brother, then indeed is
such an individual who thus perceives on the threshold of that
Liberation which is one of the major Acts of Unity.
And as the triumphal progress moves onward, all that it
touches and it touches all moves onward too, becomes ready
for the next higher form ; and those who themselves are Kings in
any Kingdom gain the right of entry in due course into the Kingdom
next above. The triumph of the Master-in-the-becoming makes
an open Way, and on this open Way treads all Life, itself moving
forward as he moves forward. For the triumph lies not in personal
achievementthis, at such a stage, could count but little. Indeed,
it would be of little, if
any avail. The triumph lies in a magic
whereby life is added to Life in all
things. His own Initiation is but
the sum-total of the myriad Initiations he has learned to confer upon
every living thing in che universe around him, and even, in a spirit of
at-one-ment, upon the hosts of the universe beyond him. His own
triumph is but the keystone of the Arch he has miraculously built.
It is but the apotheosis of a host of triumphs. He ascends, and all
ascends with him each in its own degree, each to its own measure.
And as with Kingdoms of Nature, so with Kingdoms of Con-
sciousness, the Master-in-the-becoming climbs plane after plane
until the Monad, self-conscious on his own plane, welcomes
home the messengers he has sent to the fartherest confines
of manifested matter, welcomes home messengers who bring
him the fruits of their conquests, so that through them he
attains a conscious kingship over all lower forms. Time will yet
elapse before such kingship is able to be exercised in all complete-
ness through every part of the conquered domains. The kingship
may for the time remain potential, but there is
kingship, and
through exercise will its full majesty appear.
Like all other Initiations, this mighty Fifth must in large
measure be self-achieved, and in some way, too, self-conferred.
But a condition-precedent is the Great Accord of Nature. Unless
this rings forth in no uncertain measure, the candidate is not yet

how to utter the Word of Power in each Kingdom, so that at its
uttering each Kingdom pauses, as it were, to listen, to wonder, to
know, and then to burst forth into an ecstasy of joy and gratitude.
Only the utterance of the Word of Power can call forth the
Assent, but when Word after Word has been spoken in
Kingdom
after Kingdom of Nature, on plane after plane of Consciousness,
and when, on the sounding of the final Word the Sentence of
Macrocosmic Life has become complete, then by its own Power
is he who has learned to utter it able to 'place his feet upon the
Path beyond.
I have been very forcibly reminded of those words ;
"
I am
the gambling of the cheat," and so on. How abundantly true
these words are of him who passes onwards through the Kingdoms
Individual to the first of the Kingdoms Universal, where in-
dividuality, triumphing, universalizes itself in terms of the fir"st
great step on the macrocosmic Path
"
I am the gambling of the
cheat, and I am his triumph," a triumph he perceives in some part
of him even as he gambles, even as he cheats. For the taking of
the fifth step is a vision for each form of manifested life of its
eventual triumph, be its present circumstances what they may, be
the darkness ever so black. The lower bodies may ignore, but the
Higher Self rejoices, for it knows that the achievement of one is
not merely witness to the certainty of all, but draws that certainty
appreciably closer to each growing life in each Kingdom of Nature.
And he who takes this final step in microcosmic life has the
supreme joy of knowing that all the worlds move onwards with
him, rejoice with him, share with him his triumphant bliss and sense
of unification with them. He knows himself the Alpha and Omega
of microcosmic worlds.
I wish I could reproduce the great triumphant Chant which is
the Song of the Master Ascended. It is a Song which his being
sings and which the worlds fill with their power because his Song is
theirs. He sings of his unity with all the worlds through which he
has passed. He sings the songs the denizens of the mineral king-
dom sing, the songs of the earth, of the rock, of the stone, of all
things mineral. He sings the song of the trees, of flowers, of the
grass. He sings the songs of the birds and animals. He sings the
songs of human beings. For all songs are his songs. He has sung
them all as he has passed from stage to stage. But now he sings

them all in their complete fulfilment. And as the worlds sing with
him, into even their singing creeps the faint sound of the future,
and the harmony imperfect foreshadows its perfection. As an
undercurrent, as an echo from out of the future, as an as yet
unreached consummation, the triumph, the fulfilment, of the
Master blends with harmonies as yet unfinished, and for a moment,
to each manifested life, the picture of its purpose stands revealed
in melody.
The Master Ascended sings of his passage through the worlds,
of the time when he was Alpha, and of the climbing upwards to
the final Omega, where yet another Alpha becomes the starting-
point of yet another spiral. He sings of his trials and sorrows, of
his obstacles and failures, as precious guides to joy and power.
He sees all troubles as messengers of the God of Love, and sings
in praise alike of happiness and desolation. And as he thus sings,
somewhat of darkness falls away from trouble everywhere, and
illusion of loneliness and heartache recedes before the splendour
of the Real, at least for a while. For all time, too, the burden of
the worlds is
lightened, for power has increased and ignorance has
diminished.
Thus, while the Master Ascended sings the song of the
gambling of the cheat, identifying himself with the cheat in his
cheating and in his gambling, at the same time he sings the song
of the honour of the cheat, and while the cheat is cheating,
his soul whispers the song of his honour, for he hears the
Master's voice and knows that voice to be his own. The
Master resolves the imperfect into the perfect, and all that
is as yet but bud feels stirring within itself the flower-to-be.
A Flower of earth's humanity, of every Kingdom of Nature,
has revealed to every seed, to every bud, that within lie
unfolding
flowers no less glorious ; and all things grow light of heart.
The candidate seems to remember, and in a manner recapitu-
late, the various incarnations, whether group-soul or individual, which
have brought him to his triumph. He reviews them, passes them
in view before him, and perceives the unfoldment of a Master
from seed to perfect flower. And by the magic of At-one-ment
he knows that the Life which has thus blossomed to a relative per-
fection in him is but as the Life in all things. He thus perceives
the perfect flower in every form of manifested life, whether seed,
bud or flower, at no matter what stage of unfoidment. And only

The Master
treats that Life
with Reverence
because he knows his own triumph to be part of the triumph
universal, and because his triumph ts a triumph for each and all,
does he go forward with all into the Kingdom Universal, where
individuality enters upon its first transcendence the first of an
endless chain of ascending transcendences, and all other forms a
stage forward on their respective pathways. His may be a major
Liberation, but it is the apotheosis in an individuality of liberations
innumerable.
Himself opening a gateway, all
gateways are opened. Arid
one of the features of greatest interest seems to lie in the fact
that a Master does not become until the worlds are ready to
receive him, so that his own strength alone is
inadequate to the
triumph the world must be with him, and add its strength
to his.
The first of the microcosmic Initiations gives birth to the
Christ individual. The second, third and fourth are stages on the
road through youth to maturity. The Fifth is the Christ individual
triumphant and the birth of the Christ universal, the beginning of
the major or cosmic Initiations. The Master becomes the Guardian
of all the Kingdoms of Nature, their Protector at all times, for
there is a special relationship between Him and them. They bore
witness to His fitness for advancement. They shared with Him
His expansion and ascension. There is, therefore, an intimacy
heretofore non-existent, an identification of a new nature ,
and the responsibility of the individual thus honoured is con-
stant and great. Be it remembered and exercised ; it involves
both dignity and delicacy as between the Master and the
Kingdoms through which He has passed to reach His present
stature.
The Master will be conscious of the life in all things. For Him
there is no division into organic and inorganic. He perceives God
in all things. That is. He perceives all things to be Divine within
all things Life passing onwards to its Glory, and the very forms
themselves, which Life takes, being Life. Indeed there is
naught
but Life, and form is but another name for Life, for Life which
helps Life to live
The Master knows of naught but Life in reality, and treats that
Life with the reverence He knows to be due to all Life, not be-
cause it is from God, for such a phrase is but a cloak for ignorance,
but because it is so wonderful in its destiny

Humanity itself is but a form for

The Master know$ how He regarcj s jhose on higher rungs of the
Eternal Ladder. And thus knowing, He so lives that those below
may be encouraged to regard Him as He regards Those beyond
Him, because They so live as to evoke such regard.
But has earth lost her child, is
humanity bereft of her triumph
ant son ? Nay ! He has come forth from the bosom of the light,
and He standeth again on the threshold of Nirvana, Himself
seeming the very embodiment of that light, glorious beyond all
telling, a manifested Son of God. But now His face is turned to
earth, His eyes beam with divinest compassion on the wandering
sons of men, His brethren after the flesh ;
He cannot leave them
comfortless, scattered as sheep without a shepherd. Clothed in
the majesty of a mighty renunciation, glorious with the strength
of perfect wisdom and
"
the power of an endless life," He returns
to earth to bless and guide humanity, Master of Wisdom, kingly
Teacher, divine Man.
Returning thus to earth, the Master devotes Himself to the
service of humanity with mightier forces at His command than He
wielded while He trod the Path of discipleship ;
He has dedicated
Himself to the helping of man, and He bends all the sublime
powers that he holds to the quickening of the evolution of the
world. He pays to those who are approaching the Path the debt
He contracted in the days of His own chelaship, guiding, helping,
teaching them as He was guided, helped, and taught before.
