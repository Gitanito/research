  		              		Experience Description   

    I remember telling the nurses who administered the contrast solution, that I felt nauseous, dizzy, and had difficulty breathing. I was in pain for a few seconds. I heard the nurses say 'please lift your legs', but I couldn’t do it. I remember they lifting them for me. I remember saying 'Please call me wife.' Then I said the Jewish prayer called 'Shema.' It feels like I said it a few times. 

  The next thing I remember was the voices. I heard  loud voice screaming numbers. Then I saw a very strong and warm light, almost like the one you see when you look at galaxies. I felt like I was coming out of a tunnel when I saw the lights. It had different rings. The outer rings were darker than the inner rings. I then saw the names of my daughters in the brightest part of the light. The names where floating in the  warm light. The feeling was pleasant. I felt relaxed during this time. I don’t really remember how it ended. The next memory I have is being moved to a stretcher and then to the ambulance.
