  		              		Experience Description   

    I was 17 years old, on a date with my then boyfriend and our friend. After seeing a movie, we were required to cross a four lane highway to get back to our parked car. We were standing in the turning lane, as I bent down to fix my shoe lace, a Jeep Wagoneer, crossed two lanes of travel and struck me in the turning lane. I was thrown into the air, and landed on the pavement on my face. 

I did wake up and remember thinking, it’s so bright, but it was midnight, and it was so cold, but it was the middle of June. I was taken to the hospital, where it was found that I had multiple trauma and life-threatening injuries requiring immediate surgery. I remember waking up as the surgeon was beginning the surgery, I felt like I was being ripped apart. 

At some point, I had no discernible heart beat and my pupils were fixed and dilated. During this time, I found myself in a extremely dark, warm, peaceful place, for lack of a better word, I couldn’t see anything, but I wasn’t afraid. I felt a “presence” but I couldn’t see anything. I had no fear, although I was confused. 

I spent a month in the hospital.
