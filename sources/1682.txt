Theodore Deodatus Nathaniel Besterman was born in Łódź, Poland, on 22 November 1904 and he moved to London during his youth. He taught at the London School of Librarianship in the 1930s and served in the British army in World War II. &nbsp;In 1945 he became the first editor of the Journal of Documentation, a publication concerned with cataloguing and organizing academic information.

From the 1950s, Besterman devoted himself to the works of Voltaire which he translated and edited as Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century. He instigated the Voltaire Foundation at Oxford University which contains his large collection of books and manuscripts. In 1954, he published a biography of Voltaire.1  Psychical Research

Besterman joined the Society for Psychical Research in 1925, acting as librarian, journal editor and investigations officer. In the following years he contributed numerous articles about psychical research, and books on crystal gazing, dowsing, mediumship, and the theosophist and women’s rights activist Annie Besant.

Besterman was open to the existence of psychic phenomena, but his writings are noted for a cautious and often sceptical approach. The author and spiritualist campaigner Arthur Conan Doyle took such exception to a critical review by Besterman of GK Hack’s Modern Psychic Mysteries, Millesimo Castle, Italy&nbsp;that he resigned from the SPR, complaining that Besterman’s arguments were ‘absurd’, ‘essentially unscientific’ and ‘biased’, and displayed ‘puerile perversity’.2 Besterman defended his comments in a subsequent reply.3  Investigations

In 1931, Besterman published negative results of clairvoyance experiments using playing cards.4 The following year he published details of an experiment to test the accuracy of witness observations at a spiritualist séance, in which he reported the sitters made numerous errors.5

In 1934, Besterman reported on sittings arranged by SPR investigators with the Austrian physical medium Rudi Schneider, the results of which were inconclusive.6

Also in 1934, Besterman visited Rio de Janeiro where he took part in sittings with the internationally known physical medium Carlos Mirabelli.7 His subsequent report is notable for charges of fraud, although it also describes phenomena that he was unable to explain. The report was critiqued by an SPR colleague Eric Dingwall, an experienced investigator of mediums. The records of three of the sittings attended by Besterman were later found to describe the materialization of a woman in London known to him, and a reasonably clear photograph which, he is said to have agreed, bore a strong resemblance to her – none of which is mentioned in his own account (Details of this episode can be found here.)
