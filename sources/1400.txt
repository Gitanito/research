 Spence (1874-1955) was a mythographer, leading figure of the Celtic Revival (he was first president of the Scottish National Movement and presider of the Ancient Druid Order), and Atlantis-devotee.  This journal was his attempt to explore all aspects of the Atlantis myth and of western mythology and the occult, especially as relating to the Faerie Realm.  A critic said of him (in the newspaper he edited) that he "creates for himself in exile a Scotland of the mind, a spiritual fatherland, the microcosm of the Caledonian scene.  He is a Faust, or, shall we say, a Thomas Rymour, a man of alchemies and druidisms, a man of magical ancestry . . . ."  He was a romantic, in short.  The goal of the journal was "Rebuilding the Temple of Magic, An Appeal to Mystics."  Cammell was a poet, novelist and historian who went on to write notable studies of Gabriel Rosetti and Aleister Crowley and later took over the editorship of Light.  He contributed historical sketches on Goethe and Bulwer Lytton to the journal, which also carried material on Atlantis by Paul Le Cour (1871-1954), the French opposite number of Spence, and on Vampires, Egyptian and Mexican mythology, the Elemental Races, the origins of the Rosicrucians, the elixir of life, etc.  Contributions by Cyrus Field Willard, M. Oldfield Howey, Coleman Parsons, and, notably, Victor B. Neuburg.  The journal carried advertisements for Pansophia (the Universal Pansophic Society for North America and Mexico), and, appropriately, for AMORC ("Suppressed Knowledge of the Ages"), etc.  Readers were encouraged to take part in Spence's Ancient Order of Atlantis (free to subscribers) and the Expedition to Seek Lost Lemuria."
