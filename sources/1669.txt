RECOMMENDATIONS.
Mr. Midwinter,
Sir,—I have perused the memoir of Mrs. Joanna
Turner, which you are about to re-publish, and have
found in it both pleasure and profit.
Her eventful life is interesting and instructive:
while it keeps the best feelings of the heart fully and
delightfully exercised, it exemplifies in no ordinary
degree the power and profit of practical godliness.
Mrs. Turner was an extraordinary woman, richly
endowed by divine grace. Engaged in the service of
God from early life, in a sphere of action where no com-
mon person could have done anything, she succeeded
in doing every thing. The opposition and obstacles,
which met her daily, seem only to have ministered to
the ardour and energy of her mind, and the healthful
exercise of her faith in God her Saviour, so as to have
rendered her ascendancy over them all the more con-
spicuous. She was poor, yet she supported the poor;
kept up the stated preaching of the Gospel, and built
two churches at her own expense, and withal became
rich! She sustained great distress of body, not with
patience merely, but with fortitude, and peace, and
joy. She lived happy and died triumphant. Her ex-
ample may be very useful to the Christian public, and
encouraging to those who would commit themselves to
God in well doing.
I hope your labour in making this little book more
generally known may be fully remunerated.
1 am, sir, with great respect,
Your friend and servant,
THOMAS M'CAULEY.
New-York, Feb. 28th, 1827.
1 most heartily unite in the above recommendation
of the Memoir of Mrs. Turner, and in the hope that it
may be re-printed and extensively circulated.

THE Life of Mrs. Turner was never before
published. It was drawn out by a female friend
after her death, and a few copies printed and cir-
culated among her particular friends and acquain-
tances.
Many to whom it has been lent, and by Whom
it has been read, have thought it desirable that
it should have a more extensive circulation. It
certainly affords a striking proef how much may
be done for the cause of Christ by a zealous indi-
vidual, and that with »very slender means. Mrs.
Turner during theearlier part of her religious
profession, possessed little else but her fervent
piety and a steady zeal for the propagation of the
Gospel, having only the small income of £30 a
year; yet she was the happy and highly honored
means of introducing the Gospel into several
towns and villages in the county of VVilts.
Pious individuals, placed"in a humble and con~
tractecl sphere, are apt to say,
"
What can I clo?"
Read the Life of Mrs. Turner, contemplate her
conduct, and "Go thou and do likewise."
Her Diary which relates to the secret work~
ings ofher heart, exhibits the power, etlicacy, and
benefit of true religion-"the religion of the
heart." By it, her thoughts, her affections, her
temper and conduct were regulated.
6.
Her heart glowed with love to God, and love
to man. She felt deeply for the miseries of her
fellow creatures—for perishing immortal souls;
and this feeling excited her to a holy activity,
and to unwearied endeavours to rescue them
from impending ruin. Her efforts were not una-
vailing, and her success affords the highest en-
couragement to pious females to exert themselves
in the same benevolent attempts to promote the
spiritual and eternal welfare of others.
To attain this honour, however, they must,
like her, maintain a close walk and daily com-
munion with God. What our Saviour said to
his disciples relative to the performance of a
particular miracle, may, perhaps, be applied with
propriety on the present occasion—"This kind
goeth not forth but by prayer and fasting.

God
will not crown the attempts of a careless worldly
professor of religion with similar success. Before

That a divine blessing may attend the perusal
of this work, and that Christian females may be
stimulated to imitate the example of Mrs. Tur-
ner,, and like the woman mentioned in the Gospel
—"Do what they can,

LIFE AND DEATH
OF
MRS. JOANNA TURNER
Mrs. Joanna Turner, the subject of the fol-
lowing Memoir, whose memory is so dear to her
friends, and whose acquaintance was so inestim-
able to all who were favoured with it, was the
daughter of Mr. John Cook, of Trowbridge, in
the county of Wilts, clothier.
Among her papers, after her decease, was
found, written with, her own hand, an account of
the early part of her life; which I will transcribe
nearly as she has expressed it, and connect it with
the memorable particulars I received, at different
times, from her own lips, and from her intimate
friends, whose veracity may be depended on; to
whom she severally related the same things.
Her narrative begins thus: "I was born A. D.
1 732,and began to be unhappy very early, through
my proud, passionate disposition. When at play,
I wanted every thing my own way; or would be
affronted and threaten to go away, I well re-

Oh, what an early hold hath the devil in the hu-

his image, his superscription.
My uncle Shrapnell used to tell my mother she
ought to correct me; and more than once, I re-
member, he himself attempted it when I discover-
ed these tempers at his house; but I cried and held
my breath in such a frightful manner, as distress-

she ever corrected or severely chid me; nor do I
recollect that ever I was subdued or softened by
any means of that kind; but on the contrary, was
made more furious and desperate by them.
When I was between eight and nine years of
age, my dear mother died. I was exceedingly
affected at her death. I believed she was hap-
py, but was affrighted for myself lest I should die;
and thought much of death, judgment, heaven and
hell. I heard the people about me say, my mother
was a good woman; she prayed and read the
Scriptures and other good books in her chamber,
and received the sacrament constantly. I re-
member, one Lord's day, when I and my young-
est brother were at home with her, I observed
the tears trickle down her cheeks while she read
a little book:—I went and kissed her, and looked
into it, for I could read when very young, and
perceived the title to be, "He will not break

a little spiritual light given me, I providentially
met with the book, and found it full of the Gospel.

that I never understood them: but, after her death,
I wished and tried to be good; was careful not to
tell lies, nor play on the Lord's day.
Having a little book given me, entitled "Pray-
ers for Children," I used these prayers for a long
time, with great exactness, praying seven times a
day, because, on reading the Psalms, I remarked,
David called so often on the Lord. 1 used to pe-
tition for meekness, humility, and the other good
dispositions I wanted; striving at the same time,
as well as I could, against anger particularly,
and other sins to which I was tempted. I read of
a Roman emperor, I think it was, who was pas-
sionate, and checked the risings of anger by re-
peating the Greek alphabet; but I thought it
would be better for me to say the Lord's Pray-
er. This I did, sometimes, running up into my
chamber and falling upon my knees; at other
times, repeating it inwardly. I suppose I was
observed in this part of my conduct; for I remem-
ber to have heard some people say, "I was an
extraordinary child.

Indeed, the Lord guided
me though I did not know him! I learned what-
ever was appointed me very fast; and liked the
company of old people better than childish play,
unless my companions would hear me read.
The same relation that gave me my prayer-
book, presented me with Janeway5

Children. On reading the dedication, I could not
proceed for tears,—but do not remember the sto-
ries affected me much at that time: but a little
halfpenny book, called a Christmas Carol, put me

1 LIFE AND DEATH OF
I was not yet nine years old;, but pride then
grew very strong; and I was much captivated by
dress,—could do any thing, suffer any thing to be
fine. And, as I loved reading, all books of enter-
tainment were perused by me with such a relish,
that I could leave every thing but fine clothes, for
them, I gradually left off the use of prayer, ex-
cept night and morning.
When between twelve and thirteen, I was put
to a very genteel boarding-school; indeed, too
high for my fortune, but as I had a first cousin
there, about tny own age, her mamma prevailed
on my father to send me thither also. My pride
and vanity was heightened at the prospect, and
constant mortifications were the consequence.
I soon left off praying and reading my Bible;
and in short, was never happy but in reading ro-
mances, novels, plays, and other books ofthe de-
vil's inspiring; and more than once attempted to
write them myself; so full was I of wickedness
at that tender age, not yet thirteen! But this
was not all:
—
One of the servants at school wanted to bor-
row a shilling of me, at a time when all my money
was spent, and I was expecting more, but was too
proud to tell her I had none: therefore took an
opportunity to steal a shilling out of the drawer
of a young lady, who slept in the same chamber
with me; hoping it would be in my power to re-
place it before it could be missed. I do not re-
member that I had any painful feelings at the time
I stole it, nor any checks of conscience for de-
nying it; which I suppose I did, with the other
scholars, when examined upon it: but when I was

caution over my conduct, that nothing appeared
to me amiable or worth pursuing, but to live and
act right. I wanted to learn economy, prudence
and neatness; and to improve myself in every

been dead near ten years, was a guardian angel to
me, and was a witness to every thing I said and
did; and I really wished and endeavoured to do,

her; I went to church constantly on Lord's days,
and frequently on prayer days; and almost con-
stantly wept when that part of the Litany was
read which mentions "fatherless children;" no
other part of the service affected me like that.
As soon as we could settle our affairs, my
youngest brdther was put apprentice; my eldest
brother lived by himself: and I bless God, that I
was taken by my dear brother Coles to board
with him, who worshipped God with his family.
Here I met with religious books: immediately be-

them, I thought it best to destroy them.

sin distressed me so much as stealing the shilling
while at school, and some halfpence from some
near relations, at different times; I thought I was
the greatest sinner that ever breathed, and that
it was a mercy the laws of the land had not been

from God and man. I was, notwithstanding,
sweetly comforted by that scripture,—"Let him

that he was just in justifying such an ungodly

convinced me it was wrong to read romances, &c.

In this small unfinished account, Mrs. Turner
gives of the early part of her life, she says, she
is not certain that she has mentioned every thing

journals, and the letters we have received from
her various correspondents, that the gay world
became, once more the object of her attention;
even after she had been under the most serious
convictions of sin, despairing of forgiveness, and
thinking God could not be just without sentencing
her to hell; and had been set at liberty from this
condemning power of the law, by a Gospel ser-
mon, and was enabled to cry out, "Bless the
Lord, O my soul, who forgiveth all thine iniqui-
ties!" &c. And that her attachment to the fash-
ionable amusements of the age was as strong as
ever: she being, as I have been told by her most
intimate friends, the ring-leader in all the vain
amusements of the town; going from house to
house to get a party for the ball, the card-table,
or for hearing read some pernicious romance, or
frothy novel; and nothing of the kind seemed
well ordered among her intimates, unless Joey
Cook were present.

the universal esteem in which she was held by
her acquaintance, her company was continually
courted ; and from her complexional vivacity, good
sense, genteel carriage and gay appearance, she

22 LIFE AND DEATH OP
In these seasons, pride made her emulous, and
disappointment made her wretched. She has ac-
knowledged, with the deepest abasement of soul,
that till she was converted, she could scarcely
bear the sight of any whose person and dress
were superior to her own. And it has been ob-
served, by some who well knew her, that she
endeavoured to excel all her acquaintance, in the
gaiety of her clothing, the elegance of her taste,
the poignancy of her wit, the politeness of her
address, and the agreeableness and vivacity of
her conversation.
But, while she was in the full possession of
the esteem and admiration of her acquaintance,
and taking her fill of time-wasting pleasures,
which are accounted innocent because not con-
demned by the world, conscience would not let
her enjoy happiness within, or suffer her to re-
joice in iniquity: but on the contrary, constrained
her to mowraand weep before the Lord in secret!
as may be gathered from a journal written in her
twenty-eighth year, an extract from which is here
subjoined.

the law and the prophets!' That faith only is
good which is productive of good works: and

adore the goodness of God thus remarkably dis-

My prayer was, "O may I catch the sacred
flame, kindle it, dear Lord Jesus, in my soul; O,
may this be a happy opportunity! The text was,
uFor behold the day cometh, that shall burn as
an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do
wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that com-
eth shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts,
that it shall leave them neither root nor branch:
but unto you that fear my name, shall the son of
righteousness arise, with healing in his wings!"
He shewed who the proud were, the proud in
heart, whether poor or rich: but the proud here
meant particularly, are they who will not disclaim
the merit of their own works, that will not fly to
Christ as their only hope.
He addressed the sinner with great affection:
invited him earnestly to come to Christ for salva-
tion, and warned him of his danger in the most
awful and convincing manner. He called upon
the backsliding Christian,—O my soul, how par-
ticularly, how earnestly, did he call upon thee to
return to thy first love! How justly did he call
thy present state, an eclipse! that the earth was
gotten between thee and the sun of righteousness,
and prevented the darting of his salutary beams
into thy soul, so necessary to guide thy corrupt
heart! Lord perform the promise on which thou
hast caused me to hope, "Return, thou backsli-
ding daughter^ I will heal thy backslidings, will
receive thee graciously and love thee freely !**
I bless God for some feeble glimmerings of re-
deeming love darted into my benighted soul: O,
may it increase into a blaze; and may "the Sun of
Righteousness arise with healing in his wings!"

She attended the ministry of the word with pro-

brother's sheermen, she found the good man em-

who was sitting on his knee—his wife being at
hand, sick and helpless. Surely thought she,
this man is greater than that emperor, who said
—
He had "lost a day if it were not well spent!"

not find the consolations she wanted in any place
of worship to which she Went. Though she
sometimes heard ministers whose doctrines suit»

Going one day into the house of one of her
brother's sheermen, she found the good man em-
ploying his meal-hour in teaching one of his chil-
dren to read the Bible; while he fed the youngest,
who was sitting on his knee-his wife being at
hand, sick and helpless. Surely thought she,
this man is greater than that emperor, who said-~

most easy of access, the most humble in her mien,
neat in her person, plain in her dress, and in all
things an imitator of Him who was "meek and
lowly in heart."
This convinced her that the Christian must be

beautifully expresses it, " the stature of the man.'*

Thou knoW'st my heart, my inmost's s0ul's desire
Thou know'st my aim, thou didst the aim inspire
To follow thee-however scorn'd by men,
Judg'd, censur'd, mock'd, thought singular and vain.
Thine own dear people, who thy mind should have,
Shorn of thy strength by being Worldly brave,
From touching, handling, now approve and like;
And hate the friend who at their follies strike.
They plead for Baal-"1'eligion's in the heart"
They cry; nor from their idols will they part,
"You're too severe, too strict; We see no harm;
"To be like others need not so alarm;
"I dress but little, others dress much more,
"There's such a one, out-does me I am sure!
"W'hat you can see in me, I do not know,
"My things they must be made, they make them so.
With aching heart I cry, "My sister hear,
What's written in the Word; how read'st thou there
Let Zion's daughters, Zion's King obey,
Their hearts be subject to his holy sway!
All scripture for instruction sure is given;
No needless Word was ever sent from heaven!
Peter and Paul joint testimony give,
How women should behave, and dress and live.

How sweet, how lovely 'tis to join in mind!

Saints then with saints how sweet to be allied!
Such was the church in its primeval state,
But Oh, how fallen are we all of late!

Children to praise thee thou canst raise from stones!

Beseech your brethren, every method try!

ciety of twenty or more, members of the church
of England, men and women; some husbands
and their Wives, met in a little room, last Thurs-
day, at fseven o'clock in the evening. An hum-
ble serious man, and I believe, a sincere Christian,
read a
psalm, with the first chapter of Canticles,
and the fourth of the first of John, and prayed
with us; then read a sermon of Mr. Romaine's,
sang a hymn, and concluded with prayer.
"It was almost three quarters after eight when
we separated; with a promise of continuing it, if
the Lord permit, Weekly. We parted so full ot"
love. O my friend, it was a sweet season. lt is
the Lord's doing, let us
rejoice. He hath grant-
ed me the desire of my heart, and not withholden
the request of my lips.

This society has continued, with enlargement,
more than twenty years. For a considerable time
the deceased procured ministers from Bath and
Bristol, who preached constantly once a fortnight,
on the week days, but could not be spared from
their own congregations on the Lord's day; for
which reason they walked miles to hear the Gos-
pel in the distant churches; until it pleased God
to raise up a preacher among themselves, whose
labours have been abundantly blessed and owned
of him, to the conversion of many precious souls.
Soon after the meeting of this society, a Gospel
clergyman was providentially introduced into a
parish contiguous to the town of Trowbridge;
whose preaching our friend frequently attended,
and by whom she was much strengthened. As
she had much desired and prayed for the increase
of the Redeemer's kingdom in her native place,

language of a soul stayed upon God; rejoicing
in his salvation, and in the most solemn manner

desire in every thing I say or do, to have a single
eye to God's glory: it is meet, right, and my
bounden duty so to do; but in every thing I of-
fend, by exalting self! Surely, there is none in

see one of such a proud, self-magnifying disposi-

In this same correspondence we have a very
agreeable anecdote; whereby we see how small
the beginnings of the work of God sometimes are,
and by how minute an accident great events may
be brought about. In the continuation of an ac-
count of the progress the little society is making,
for the prosperity of which she discovers an aba-
ting concern; she mentions a young man, a shop-
man to a grocer, who bore all the marks of a sin-
cere Christian. One evidence was his zeal to
communicate to the family at large, what he him-
self partook of, that is to say, the grace of God:
and those clear views of the method of salvation,
by faith alone in Jesus Christ; which at best
they had very confused ideas of.
To effect his endeavors he found it necessary to
elude their prejudices: and that the author whom
he put into their hands might be read without pre-
judice, he concealed the name in the title page.
The author, who was Mr. Whitefield, obtained
approbation: and the young man had permission
to read to them in the same volume. One of the
subjects was, the duty of family prayer, from
Joshua xxiv. 15.—The conviction of the duty led
to the practice of it: which was afterwards sup-

"From that time I had no doubt of her salva-

with her: it was a morning to be remembered: she
was thirsting for Jesus, and longed for an interest
in him more than for a thousand worlds; there
was none in heaven she desired but him: she was
looking for a sweet hymn of Mr. Cennick's, suita-

" Many, very many gracious words, dropped
from her lips, which I pray to God may be so-
lemnly impressed on every heart that heard
them: a more pleasant and smiling countenance,
in death, I never saw: nor any, in the most per-
fect health, more serene and calm: not a com-
plaint or a groan was heard: sorrow and sighing1
was already done away by her dear Redeemer;
who was wonderfully with her in the dark valley.
The Lord was her light; she had no darkness.
When they wiped the death sweats from her
face, she smiled, and said, " You cannot wipe
these away."
" In the evening, when I called again, I know
not how we were led to it, but the nurse and I
spake on a trifling subject, which we thought
would have diverted her. She looked graver
than I ever saw her. I felt the reproof, and
said, " My dear, I will talk to you of nothing
but Jesus: of his dying love, of his rising pow-
er." She smiled and said, " No; nothing, no-
thing else.'5
Miss B n watched with her
and in the night heard her say, " All glory, all
praise, all worship and adoration:" as if she had
begun the song of Moses and the lamb.
"A very short time before she expired, the
Rev. Mr. Thomas felt her pulse. She asked
him, " How he found it?" He said, he believed
she was drawing near her dissolution. She re-
plied, " Sir, I am glad of it.

He prayed with
her. She leaned forward in her chair to pre-

"
Many, very many gracious words, dropped
from her lips, which I pray to God may be so-
lemnly impressed on every heart that heard
them: a more pleasant and smiling countenance,
in death. l never saw: nor any, in the most per-
fect health, more serene and calm: not a com-
plaint or a groan was heard: sorrow and sighing
was already done away by her dear Redeemer;
who was
wonderfully with her in the dark valley.
The Lord was her light; she had no darkness.
When they wiped the death sweats from her
face, she smiled, and said,
"
You cannot wipe
these away."
"
"
In the evening, when I called again, I know
not how we were led to it, but the nurse and I
spake on a triliing subject, which We thought
would have diverted her. She looked graver
thanl ever saw her. I felt the reproof, and
said,
"
My dear, I will tall: to you of nothing
but Jesus: of his dying love, of his rising pow-
er." She smiled and said, "No; nothing, no-
thing else." Miss Bin Watched with her
and in the night heard her say, "All glory, all
praise, all worship and adoration:" as ifshe had
begun the song of Moses and the lamb.
'
"A very short time before she expired, the
Rev. Mr. Thomas felt her pulse. She asked
him,
"
How he found it?"' He said, he believed
she was drawing near her dissolution. She re-
plied,
"
Sir, I am glad of it." He prayed with
her. She leaned forward in her chair to pre-
vent coughing. Her mamma observed herlift-
ing up her hands to heaven with great earnest-
ness; and, in a few minutes after, she fell asleep
in Jesus."
76 LIFE AND DEATH OF
But while Miss Cook was thus profitably and
delightfully employed, in visiting the sick, and
in other offices of love, among her friends at
Bristol, she received information that she must
change the plan of her life; and either relinquish
the Methodists, or leave the advantage of board-
ing in her late comfortable manner, free of all
expense. She did not hesitate a moment, which
to choose; but determined to be faithful to her
holy calling, though she lived, in the meanest
cottage, on bread and water. So far from giv-
ing up the people of God, she only waited for
such an opening in providence, to look out for
a cottage in order to be more at liberty to for-
ward the cause she had espoused, by having a
place of her own, where she could receive the
people, and accommodate the ministers, who
came from far. But she was at a loss where to
find an empty cottage, or part of a house, at
Towbridge: and the following extract from her
journal will best set forth her painful and pleas-
ing feelings on the occasion. She betook her-
self to prayer, as her only resource, in this time
of distress and difficulty; for thus she expresses
herself:
" I importuned the God of the whole earth to
provide me an habitation, food and raiment; and
every convenience requisite for my poor body,
as should be best for his glory. And I would
adore him with unceasing praises, that my soul
is not destitute: that he himself is its habitation,

And now we see this honored handmaid of the
Lord an housekeeper, with the small income of
the interest of five hundred pounds: and the Lord
gave her faith to believe, that, with this small
pittance, and the money she could earn by plain
work, she should be able to support herself, do
something for the church of God; and once a
week, at least, assist a»poor sister with a dinner.
She begins by inviting her gay friends to her
house-warming, boldly telling them they must
expect spiritual fare with their temporal, as may
be gathered from the following letter:
—
'My dear friend,
"I have invited all my friends and relations to

I can now no longer describe Miss Cook, and
it may be thought by some, to be a difficult task,
to represent Mrs. Turner, as the chief subject of
the sequel of these memoirs, without detracting
from Mr. Turner's worth: but it must be observ-
ed, that her pious zeal was no small excellence
in Mr. Turner's eyes; and that, in the union he
formed with her, he had not the least desire to
quench it; but rather was concerned to cherish
and promote it.
There was a reverse in the complexion of the
happy pair, whereby they were mutually useful
to each other: and mutually, according to their
respective abilities, laid themselves out for the
glory of God and the good of his church. And
so strong are the affections of the mournful sur-
vivor to the memory of his deceased consort,
that I am persuaded, though perhaps he may be
somewhat displeased by an apology on the pre-
sent occasion, he can never see these memoirs in
a light too strong, or too expressive of the worth
and excellency of her whom his soul loved.
I therefore proceed to observe, that as soon
after the solemnization of their marriage as was
convenient, she quitted her own habitation, ap-
propriating it solely to the worship of God,
where, after the agreeable revolution on her part,
she had the additional pleasure, of seeing a con-
tinued succession of precious souls, brought to a
saving acquaintance with the Lord Jesus Christ.
The new relation required attention to the du-
ties peculiar to it: which she entered upon and
filled up with the greatest ease and affability,
supporting a vein of spirituality as strong as ever.

102 LIFE AND DEATH OP
Mr. Turner having just now opened a large shop,
she perceived it was her duty to add to her small
fortune, by taking such a part in his business as
she was capable of: and a little practice, with her
abilities soon made her service very considera-
ble. For ten years, she was a laborious shop-
woman, besides keeping the books, and attending
to the business of the counting house; which she
did, with a punctuality and exactness as well as
dispatch, that would do honor to any clerk in the

Mr. Turner having just now
opened a large shop,
she perceived it was her duty to add to her small
fortune, by taking such a
part in his business as
she was capable of: and a little practice, with ber
abilities soon made her service very considera-
ble. For ten years, she was a laborious shop-
woman, besides keeping the hooks, and attending
to the business of the counting house; which she
did, with a
punctuality and exactness as well as
dispatch, that would do honor to any clerk in the
kingdom. ,

her less useful in the cause of God, or less devo-

rule, 'Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it

portunity slip, that might be employed for the
glory of God, or the good of her neighbor: and
so, by using every moment to the best purposes,
she found time for the discharge of every duty,
the Lord in his providence called her to. And it
can scarcely be conceived, by persons unacquaint-

Lord, how exemplarily she filled up her public
station: how suited in her address, to persons of
every class in life; and how careful she was to
watch for the season in which the word might be
fitly spoken that respected eternal things: in
which she knew every soul was deeply interested,
though few had love enough for their own souta
to be careful about them.

of advice, comfort, or encouragement in the way

The first year oftheir marriage produced a re-

up with gun-powder by the carelessness ofa ser-

they had reason to sing of mercy as well as judg-

their doors and windows and extinguished their
tires to prepare for bed, they were going into a
room, where their lives would have been in im-

For many years the Lord had inspired Mrs.
Turner, with a desire to introduce the Gospel at
Tisbury, in Wilts. She had conceived a great
partiality for that village, because it was Mr.
Turner's native place, and quite destitute of the
knowledge of salvation by Christ.
By frequent visits she had made herself well
acquainted with the forlorn state of the people
residing in it: and seemed persuaded, that if the
Gospel could be introduced, much good would be
done. For a long, season she laid this matter be-
fore the Lord, as Mr. Turner could not, for some
time, enter into her views: however, he at last
consented to employ a brother on the spot, to
look out a house that they might purchase.
In the spring of the year 1781, a house was of-
fered for sale. Just at this period, a legacy of
a hundred pounds was left them by a Christian
friend, who, in his life, had been a great favourer
of the Gospel: These two remarkable openings
of providence confirmed her in the persuasion
that the matter was of God.
The purchase was made: and, having given her-
self unto prayer for a blessing upon the attempt
with Mr. Turner's permission and hearty concur-
rence, she determined to leave Trowbridge, and
all her concerns there, for a time, and go to Tis-
bury in the strength of the Lord: notwithstanding
she knew she had to cope with many rich and
powerful opposers of the Gospel there; and was
likely to be charged with folly and enthusiasm,
and accounted a busy-body, interfering where she
had no call, by many of her dearest Christian
brethren, who could not enter into the purity of
her motives.

has visibly attended some: If you see the Rev.
Mr. Bi-n, before you leave London, tell him,
the Lord is a
prayer answering God! The morn-
ingl set off for Tisbury, it was under the sweet
influence of his prayers for success; and I hope
he will not faint, but continue to hold up -all our
hands, and others of the dear servants of the
Lord: Elias was a man of like passions; and yet
by prayer, he shut and opened heaven; and it is
'a weapon,' Mr. Hart says, 'the weakest can
wield the best.' Never, never before did I need,
did I experience, so much of the divine pow-
gr and love extended towards me."

The most notoriously wicked wretch in the
parish, she says, in another letter, was awaken-
ed under the first sermon He was a great drunk-
ard, and so involved in his circumstances, by his
extravagancies, that he was driven almost to de-
stroy himself; who from that time continued in
the good ways of God, and became a good
husband, good father, and a useful member of
society.
The instances of success attending the word
preached, are too numerous to be inserted here!
And our friends were encouraged to promote and
put forward the building a very neat little chapel
;
of which, and the increase of converts, she
speaks thus in a letter to her beloved cousin, dated
Tisbury, Oct. 17, 1781.
"My beloved sister,
"My Lord is with me: He calls a worm, his
friend, he calls himself, my God!—Wonders are
wrought here in the name of Jesus: never, never
did I see, or expect to see, so great a spread of
the Gospel, and as deep and solid as it is wide:
But it is all the Lord's doings: He shall have all
the glory; and all my poor abilities shall be con-
stantly exerted, to teach the peopje, yea, all the
people, to ascribe all to him.

While the chapel was building, another house
was licensed for preaching, at Ebsbourn; whith-

one o'clock, every Lord's day. Thus she speaks
erf it in the same letter:
—
"We have another house licensed, six miles
from hence, and great success attends the preach-
ing there; but it is too far for me to walk, and no
one here dares lend me a horse. Satan roars,
as he does here: but can do no more. A convert
from thence came to us yesterday, a solid man.
They have blown horns, twice, to disturb; but
now they are most peaceable.
"The dear people are fitting up a place them-
selves for preaching, and a stable for the horse.
They are a most blessed people, have met to-
gether for mutual edification near a year; came
to our first preaching, and besought us to come
over and help them."
On Lord's-day, the sixteenth of October, in the
forenoon, a society was formed of those who
were truly united to Christ: and thus she speaks
on the occasion:—

Whilst the walls of the outward church were
raised, the inward was increasing daily in many
hearts; and thus she speaks of the progress of the
work to Miss E. J--n:-

poor that receive the Gospel: as yet, the richer
sort grow more and more averse, more despising,
more rejecting: notwithstanding the judgments
God has been pleased to execute amongst them,
and the visible outstretching of his arm of power,
to defend and protect his defenceless ones, from
all their attempts against us.
"I sensibly perceive Satan cast out of many
hearts, and taking stronger possession of some
others. He has had great power, for many ages,
in these parts: but one that is stronger, the Al-
mighty Jesus, is come to help, snd wr

things I do expect from him.
"I do assure you, my dear sister, it is not fan-

have not, since Mr. Whitefield's time, known
such a divine unction, such constant power of the
Spirit, attend the ministry of the word, as in this
place, whoever were the preacher: Our poor
brother Watts was there a fortnight ago, and
made such a blessing: The glory belongs to God,
for he is all the power.
"I have more than twenty children come to be
catechised, boys and girls. They learn amazing-
ly fast: I have them Tuesdays and Fridays, from
five to six; and a most pleasing employment it is:

I have formed into a society those who profess
to be on the Lord's side. This, I think, will be
a mean to preserve from extremes; from neglect-
ing those that appear concerned about their souls,
and from making too much of those appearances,
which sometimes die away. By this mean,
those that are feeble may be strengthened; for,
surely, none want helps of every kind, more than
newly convinced souls; it seems unkind and un-

to be babes in Christ! So, you see, my beloved,

"On Sally's reading to me this morning, I was
deeply affected with heartfelt grief and astonish-
ment, at two things; the one that my dear Saviour,
when in a body here upon earth, should say, 'He
had not where to lay his head,' it made me weep;
I breathed out my soul to him, and said, 4
He
should have had my house for his home, if I had
seen him destitute:' And then I asked myself, if
I could, were I willing now to open my house to
his members? Yes, our blessed Lord hath made
us willing, we are my dear Thomas, through his
strengthening us! Whatever others do, we will
follow the lamb of God, whithersoever he goeth,
and to whatsoever he leads us, by his Spirit,
word, and providence! And oh: how sweetly do
I enjoy his spiritual presence at this time! He
is with me in my heart, or there would not be
such delightful peace, and joy, and love.
"The other thing which affected me, was, holy
grief, that the Gergasenes should beseech him
to depart out of their coasts, because they lost a
little substance, a few swine! O my dear, what
is worldly substance, what are earthly things,
which are but for a moment, in comparison of
eternity.
"Every thing goes on wonderfully well! I
have not the least doubt, care, nor fear, but all
will be properly completed against the time! I
cast every care upon my Almighty God, for I
cannot sink, but soar! We shall have a pentecost
blessing, my dear Thomas, a great out-pouring of

of spiritual things, to read or pray by Tier: and
only shewed their love by attending to the gra-

his people.
As soon as her strength would permit, she vi-

means by which she might introduce the Gospel

most cordially congratulated her on her recove-

rapid progress the cancer was now making, that
she should be an inhabitant of this world but a
little while longer, and therefore was desi-

" Till crooked turnings took thee from my sight,
My much loved T , I watch'd thee with delight
Preserve him, O my God, with tenderest care;
Let man and beast thy kind protection share!
Blest comforter, descend into his breast,
And sweetly sooth his feeling heart to rest:
Inspire and animate his precious soul,
And every jar in nature, now control!
How easy this, my God, for thee to do;
Give but thyself, and all things we let go
In sweet submission to thy sacred will;
Yet thy dear gifts we love for thy sake still!
We love each other, and shall ever love;
'Tis God's command, and sure he must approve!
O favor'd creatures we, to be so blest,
On earth to have so large a share of rest;
Blessed in each other, and by Godcarest!
Let us, my love, in strict obedience live,
And our wholeselves to our dear Jesus give,
To save, to use, to order as he please!
This is the happy way to live in ease.
By blest experience, this I know full well,
And with delight, my blest experience tell,
Myself the happiest mortal now on earth,
An heir of glory, by my heavenly birth,
And having Christ, with him, I all possess;

And my clogg'd spirit parted from its clay,

LIFE AND DEATH OF
Tisbury, Sept. 1484
"
Till crooked turnings took thee from my sigh
My much loved Ti, I watch'd thee with delight
Preserve him, O my God, with tenderest care,
Let man and beast thy kind protection share!
Blest comforter, descend into his breast,
And sweetly sooth his feeling heart to rest:
Inspire and animate his precious soul,
And every jar in nature, now control!
How easy this, my God, for thee to do;
Give but thyself, and all things we let go
In sweetsubmission to thy sacred will;
Yet thy dear gifts We love for thy sake still!
We love each other, and shall ever love;

'T s God's eo d d h t p
0 fav0r'd creatures we, to be so blest,
On earth to have so large a share of rest;
Blessed in each other, and by God carest!
Let us, my love, in strict obedience live,
And our wholeselves to our dear Jesus give,
To save, to use, to order as he please!
f
This is the happy way to live in ease.
By blest experience, this I know full well,
And with delight, my blest experience tell,
Myself the happiest mortal now on earth,
An heir of glory, by my heavenly birth,
And having Christ, with him, I all possess;
Am happy, rich and full, he doth so bless!
Sure, in a goodly place my lines are cast:
My cup runs o'er; of heavenly joys I taste!
So much of heaven, while here, vouchsaf'd to me,
Think you, my dear, I shall such glory see
When dull mortality is chas'd away,
And my clogg'd spirit parted from its clay,
As those whose life to suffering was a prey?
The blessed, joyful, holy change to nge
Will be amazing only in degree!

Thus did the Lord continue to bless her labours

mitted to have an interview of a few minutes with
her, but for no longer time, on account of her ex-

Lord Jesus! He will do every thing for you!-1-
Let not the cares oflife hinder you! As the fowls
came down upon Abraham's sacrifices, he drove
them away: so do you, drive them away."
A little before she died, two of the shop-ser-
vants came to the bed-side, to take leave of the
best of mistresses, to whom she said, 'God bless
you! open your mouths wide, and he wr
ill fill

desired to be lifted up in the bed: then kissed her
servants and friends who were about her, and
thanked them for all their kind services! She
then said, 'By the grace of God, I am what I am,

Her most nearly beloved female friend was
moved to pray with her: at the close of which

"I doubt not but this labour of love will be

reviewing my dear sister Turner's letters has
been to me; which I could not collect to send by
my cousin. Our correspondence has been of
aucha standing: that my letters alone will make

send by way of Trowbridge to you.
"All I read, hear, or think of her, greatly en-

was in through her whole illness, spake more than
all or any words could do.' All I can say of it
is, 'It was perfect peace, perfect patience, per-

All truly spiritual people, of every name or
persuasion, rank or degree among men, felt gen-
erally, that unction of the Holy One in her com-
pany and conversation, that was seldom to be met
with in Christians of narrow views and party spi-
rits, bigotted to their own particular opinions in
non-essential points. For she used to say,
'There was an excellence peculiar to every de-
nomination of spiritual people, worth imitating:
and thus sucking honey from every flower, she
became herself such a store house of spiritual
sweets, from whence all, that would hearken to
her wisdom, might receive plentifully the precious
soul-nourishing food of Gospel milk and honey: in-
somuch that many came miles to hear her wis-
dom, and could say, with the queen of Sheba
concerning Solomon, tli&t 'the half had not been
told them.'
She was highly esteemed and honoured by min-
isters of every persuasion: some of whom are not
backward to acknowledge, that by her they learn-
ed the way of God more perfectly. And she highly
esteemed them in love for their work's sake,
honouring them as the ambassadors of Christ,
and her house and purse were ever open to sup-
ply their wants. If they were in straitened cir-
cumstances, whether spiritual or temporal, and
she knew it, she esteemed it her privilege to do
all in her power to relieve them; by wrestling
with the Lord in prayer for their spiritual relief,
and opening her hand for the supply of their tem-
poral necessities. And it is remarkable that she
has been more than ordinarily impressed with a
desire to impart, unsolicited, when the case of

persuasion, rank or degree among men, felt gen-
erally, that unction ofthe Holy One in her com-
pany and conversation, that was seldom to be met
with in Christians ot' narrow views and party spi-
rits, bigotted to their own
particular opinions in
non-essential points. For she used to say,
'There was an excellence peculiar to every de-
nomination of spiritual people, worth imitating:
and thus sucking honey from every flower, she
became herself such a store house of spiritual
sweets, from whence all, that would hearken to
her wisdom, might receive plentifully the precious
soul-nourishing food of Gospel milk and honey: in-
somuch that many came miles to hear her wis-
dom, and could say, with the queen of Sheba
concerning Solomon, that 'the half had notbeen
told tliem.' _
She was
highly esteemed and honoured by min-
isters of every persuasion: some of whom are not
backward to acknowledge, that by her they learn-
ed the way of God more perfectly. And she highly
esteemed them in love for their work's sake,
honouring them as the ambassadors of Christ,
and her house and purse were ever
open to sup-
ply their wants. If they were in straitened cir-
cumstances, whether spiritual or
temporal, and
she knew it, she esteemed it her privilege to do
all in her power to relieve them; by wrestling
with the Lord in prayer for their spiritual relief,
and opening her hand for the supply of their tem-
poral necessities. And it is remarkable that she
has been more than ordinarily impressed with a
desire to impart, unsolicited, when the case of
9
194 LIFE AND DEATH OF
some good man has been more than ordinarily
distressing.
She seldom suffered a Christian, whether in a
public or private capacity, to leave her company
without prayer; for which her spiritual and edi-
fying conversation was a suitable preparative.
—
If they appeared backward to the exercise, she
would press it upon them by every weighty con-
sideration; would so enforce the word of God
concerning acknowledging him in all their ways,
and being willing to be accounted vile in the sight
of the world, and the Michals of Israel, for God's
sake, that they have been constrained to try their
gift; and while in the act, they have been so
helped and strengthened by her secret aspira-
tions, that they have often rose from their knees,
surprised at the liberty given them from the
Lord.
The young, the old, the careless, and the for-
mal, have been led to discover the beauty and
excellence of true vital religion, by her conver-
sation and deportment. Several gay young per-
sons have been melted down into tears of repent-
ance before her, and received the most teachable
disposition of soul: which she has cherished and
nursed up, till they have been brought into the
liberty of the Gospel, and proved valuable mem-
bers of society.
She used to teach her pupils to serve God, not
only on Lord's days, by hearing the word, and
prayer, and resting from bodily labour, but to
serve him likewise all the week: in their families,
by social, and in their trade and calling, by men-
tal prayer. And soon as they had learned their

scriptures testify: but those who had itching ears,

She did not, like the pharisees, lay heavy bur-

not touch with one of her fingers: for she was a
remarkable pattern of honest industry in the du-

She was a most loving, instructive, and ten-
der mistress to her servants, having a resolution
that surmounted the greatest difficulties. And
being indefatigable in pursuing whatsoever she
took in hand, if convinced she was in the
path of duty, she equally surmounted the re-
proaches of enemies, and the solicitations of
friends.
A maid servant falling under great distress of
mind, and, for a time, becoming quite insane;
she neither put her away, nor sent her to a
place of confinement, as many of her friends ad-
vised; but kept her in her own house, and watch-
ed over her herself; using every lenient endea-
vour to relieve and bring her to reason again,
till her husband, and faithful friend Miss J n,
fearing the poor lunatic might be permitted to
do mischief, took her without Mrs. Turner's ap-
probation, and conveyed her to a house of con-
finement. But she soon made her escape to her
kind mistress, and recovering from her insanity,
loved and served her faithfully many years af-
terwards, and at last died happy in her arms; as
the following letter to Miss J n, testifies:
" My beloved sister,

Mr Turner's mother, two brothers and a nephew,
with others, were made willing to take up the
cross and follow a crucified Saviour.
Old Mrs. Turner had been exceedingly preju-
diced against the Methodists: but, by coming to
live in her son's house, they were removed. She
6aw her daughter-in-law was a pattern of piety:
her conduct won upon her exceedingly. She grad-
ually received light in her understanding, be-
came an honourable member of the church; and
after a life full of days, died in the full assurance
of faith, leaving behind her a correspondent tes-
timony. Mrs. Turner, in a letter to me, dated
August the 12th, 1784f
writes thus concerning
her:
"Our dear mother was buried on the evening
of the day that I received your letter. She was
violently seized with the small-pox, lived a fort-
night and two days, and had the disorder very
heavy. At times, we had hopes of her recovery,
till the last two days; but she herself had neither
hope nor wish for it. Her apothecary says, he
never saw one so patient in such a disorder. In-
deed, her meekness, gentleness, humility and
spirituality^ as well as her submission to the will
of God, were beyond description.
"While she was able to speak plain, she spoke
much of the Lord's gracious dealings with her
soul; and exhorted, with great wisdom and pow-
er, those she conversed with, to cleave close to
the Lord: and said, among other things, that 'if

behalf , were heard; and her endeavours, in con-
junction with her prayers, proved successful.
Mr Turner's mother, two brothers and a nephew,
with others, were made willing to take up the
cross and follow a cruciiied Saviour.
Old Mrs. Turner had been exceedingly preju-
diced against the Methodists: but, by coming to
livein her son's house, they were removed. She
saw her daughter-in-law was a
pattern of piety:
her conduct won upon her exceedingly. -She grad-
ually received light in her understanding, be
came an honourable member of the church; an
after a life full of days, died in the full assurance?
of faith, leaving behind her a
correspondent tes(
timony. Mrs. Turner, in a letter to me, date
August the 12th, 1784, writes thus concerni
her: 3
"Our dear mother was buried on the evenin
ofthe day that I received your letter. She was
violently seized with the small-pox, lived a fo
night and two days, and had the disorder very
heavy. At times, we had hopes ofher recovery,
till the last two days; but she herself had neither
hope nor wish for it. Her apothecary says, he
never saw one so patient in such a disorder. In~
deed, her meekness, gentleness, humility and
spirituality, as well as her submission to the will
of God, were beyond description.
"While she was able to speak plain, she spoke
much of the Lord's gracious ,dealings with her'
soul; and exhorted, with great wisdom and pow-
er, those she conversed with, to cleave close
to
the Lord: and said, among other things, that 'if
MRS. JOANNA TURNER. 213
she was to recover, she did not know how she
should bear the vanity of many who professed
godliness."
Being in a high fever, and very thirsty, she
told me one day, c
she was grieved that she thirst-
ed for any thing more than for Jesus.
5
"Her desire after him was soon after satisfied:
such hungering and thirsting was vouchsafed, as
she never experienced before; she did indeed
long to be with Christ! At the beginning of her
illness she once said, but never after, that 'of the
two she would choose to live a little longer, that
she might live more to the glory of God;5
but on
a friend's telling her of the finished salvation, she
rejoiced in that alone.
"As she was blind, whenever she wanted to
drink, we used to put her hand to the cup and de-
sire her to guide it to her month; on which she
once said
—
"Guide me, O thou great Jehovah!
Pilgrim o'er this barren land:
I am weak, but thou art mighty;
Guide me, with thy powerful hand!
Bread ofheaven, bread of heaven,
Feed me till I want no more?
"And she repeated the last couplet 'Bread of
heaven, bread of heaven, feed me till I want no
more5
with such an emphasis as was most animat-
ing! Once, she- spoke of a little conflict with
Satan, and wa3 set at liberty by these words;

was preached; the text, her own choosing,

It was a most agreeable sight to behold the mu-
tual tenderness and respect Mrs. Turner and her
mother-in-law were ever studious to shew to each
other. It was impossible that they should live
upon more sacred and affectionate terms: and in-
deed, there was such order and decorum pre-
served in the family by their joint conduct, and
such quietude in their most busy hours; as is
scarcely to be conceived, and very rarely imita-
ted.
Mr. Turner's nephew with a surviving brother,
were left in almost destitute circumstances; and
coming under the care of Mrs. Turner, afforded
opportunity to discover how wisely she could dis-
charge the duty of a parent She had them in all
subjection; but it was not the subjection of slaves.
They reverenced her, because they loved her;
and by her excellent and rational discipline were
restrained from evil. The youngest died of a
fever, in the tenth year of his age, at boarding-
school; where he manifested a love to the scrip-
tures, and endeavoured, by a variety of pretty
methods to excite his school-fellows to love them
also.
We have good authority to say, "He had more

taught him to lisp his Redeemer's praise, and to

him to pray extempore; and often heard him,

earnestly for the pardon of his sins, and for an in-

beauty, fine clothes, smart sayings, pert remarks,

what wicked hearts they had; how ignorant,
foolish, and sinful by nature: how Satan instilled
into them every evil desire, every proud, envious
and malicious thought; and therefore it was the
wicked spirit that made them proud of fine
clothes: which, she told them, were only made
out of the grass of the field, the bowels of worms,

her most amiable husband, and all she had in the
world, and go to Jesus.
"You will conceive of my happiness, to see
one so dearly beloved go out of the world, so
safe and happy? It was a most affecting scene,
so mournfully pleasing! I saw her expire, in
the easiest manner, without a pang, struggle or
groan, in the thirty-seventh year of her age."
While Mrs. Turner filled up every part of
civil, religious, and relative duty, and thus pre-
served a conscience void of offence, towards
man; she did not forget to preserve a good con-
science towards God.
It was a maxim with her, to keep the Lord's
presence by secret prayer and the eye of faith,
while she was busied in her shop or counting-
house: so that she made every place a house of
prayer, often saying, that 'Every morning when
she left her bed, she prayed to be enabled, 'to
give her heart to God, and her hands to the
world.' But she did not give every hour, even
of the week-days, to the world. She attended
public preaching, twice a week, constantly, and
society or prayer-meetings, once: beside the time
allotted for her private devotions, and the oppor-
tunities that offered for social prayer with her oc-
casional visiters.
The LordVday, from early in the morning
till late in the evening, was almost entirely devot-
ed to his service and worship, according to
Jsaiah58. 13.
And what was peculiarly excellent and worthy
fof imitation in Mrs. Turner, was, her constant

civil, religious, and relative duty, and thus pre-
served a conscience void of offence, towards
man; she did not forget to preserve a good con-
science towards God.
It was a maxim with her, to keep the Lord's
presence by secret prayer and the eye of faith,
While she was busied in her shop or
counting-
house: so that she made every place a house of
prayer, often saying, that 'Every morning when
she left her bed, she prayed to be enabled, 'to
give her heart to God, and her hands to the
World? But she did not give every hour, even
of the week-days, to the world. She attended
public preaching, twice a week, constantly, and
society or
prayer-meetings, once: besidethetime
allotted for her private devotions, and the oppor-
tunities that offered for social prayer with her oc-
casional visiters. ~
The Lord's-day, from early in the morning
till late in the evening, was almost entirely devot-
:ed to his service and worship, according to
Isaiah 58. 13.
°
And what was peculiarly excellent and Worthy
bf imitation in Mrs. Turner, was, her constant
222 LIFE AND DEATH OF
obedience to what she thought the will of God,
however irksome, and contrary to flesh and blood
in little things as well as great: and often would
she say, with Samuel, 'Hath the Lord as great
pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as when
the voice of the Lord is obeyed? Behold, to obey
is better than sacrifice; and to hearken, than the
fat of rams: for wilful rebellion is as the sin of
witchcraft, (which Saul was noted to punish most
severely,) and stubbornness is an iniquity and
idolatry.
5
To be stiff in our own opinions and
self-willed, or not to bend our will to the Lord's,
is as the greatest enormities.
"It does not signify ,*'
said she, "to pretend to
stand up for, and makq a great shew of scrictness
in obeying the outward ordinances of God, and
condemning the sins and departures from the
faith of others, fighting about non-essential
modes, and opinions, while we are determined to

share of divine wisdom; which she exercised on

Father's notice;" and "doth the Lord take care

She felt it her privilege, to expect the Lord's
direction in all doubtful and difficult cases of
common life; and even to bless and prosper the
smallest work of her hands. She knew that
every thing he called her to in his providence, he
would give her wisdom to perform; and therefore,
"whatever her hands found to do, she did it with
all her might," asking help of Him.
Two great advantages resulted from this sim-

to do every thing, that appeared right and proper
to be done, immediately, as soon as it occurred;
and thus, kept her mind and memory unburthen-

small income of twenty-five pounds per year, she
lived on bread and water much of her time, in or-
der to afford a meal of meat once a Week to seve-
ral poor people who could not purchase it: and
was once so reduced, as to go without bread
herself' for a whole day; and must have continued
so a longer time, had not the Lord appeared for
her wonderfully in his providence, just in the
time of need; for expecting some young friends
out of' the country to visit her, she was looking
over some letters to entertain them with, when
to her utter astonishment, gratitude and joy,
dropped out from one of them half' a guinea and
some silver.

In these restrained circumstances, she often-
times laboured with her hands on plain work; for
hire, day and night; without refreshment for her
poor body.
And when she had all things and abounded, she
did not cease her labours for the poor, but rather
increased them; doing herself two people's work
in her shop, by day, and giving up her necessary
rest at night, in order to have wherewith to give
to him that needeth; and to build an house, where
they might assemble to hear the good news of
salvation for lost sinners.
But her love was not confined to her own
church and people; it was extended towards all
mankind; towards Christians of every name. To
all who loved the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity,
and bore his image and superscription, she gave
the right hand of fellowship, saying3 "Behold my
mother and my brethren! whosoever doeth the
will of my Father which is in heaven, the same
is my brother, and sister, and mother.'* Matt. xii.
49, 50.
The following letter, among many others writ-
ten to her cousins in Mr. Wesley's society, will
give us a little specimen of her catholic spirit.
"Dear Sisters of my soul,
"I am ashamed of all I do, or think, or say;

that perfect peace, patience, and love, with
which her spirit was filled during her ilness,
when that spirit was returned to God who gave
it, and nothing remained but a lump of lifeless
clay! that clay, was amiable even in death: and
having been the temple of the Holy Ghost, was
highly reverenced and repeatedly visited, with a
melancholy pleasure by her inconsolable husband,
and a large number of weeping friends, from the
various denominations of spiritual people round
the town.
Even those ofher neighbours that had not been
favoured with her light, and enjoyment of things
eternal, could not help giving a testimony to her
moral character, by saying,

'She had not left her
equal in the town, for public and private useful-
ness, in her family, trade, and connexions."
Her husband, on whose heart this God-like
character of hers was deeply engraved, spared
no expense, to testify the deep sense he had of
her worth: inviting all the ministers who had gone
up to the help of the Lord at Tisbury, more than
thirty of whom gladly paid this tribute of respect
to her memory, by attending her funeral ! But no
part of this expense was half so honourable to
the dead, as the multitude of genuine tears that
flowed from almost every eye! Hundreds of
persons, with aching hearts, attending her obse-
quies, and lining the streets as they conveyed her
to the grave, shewed their respect, by the most
decent behavior, and the most expressive solemn,
mournful silence.

And when the voice of the singers broke
through the evening air, and penetrated the
gloomy silence that reigned among the weeping
female friends and relatives, that were admitted
by a private way into the tabernacle; it is im-
possible to describe the feelings of every heart!
One general gust of grief burst forth, and chan-
ged the awful silence, into sobs and groans of
deepest woe.
The feelings of Mr. Turner's heart on attend-
ing this melancholy solemnity, can better be con-
ceived by every mind endued with sensibility,
than described by my pen! Great was his loss:
being deprived by her death, not only of a most
amiable, useful wife, in a temporal, but of the most
agreeable companion, friend and adviser, in a
spiritual relation.
May all that knew or ever heard of her, take
the advice of her beloved pastor, who preached
her funeral sermon: 'imitating her example of
deep self abasement before God and man; saying,
from a feeling sense of inability to every good
word and work, C
I am nothing;' yet, in the
strength of the Lord, be pressing forward, with
united efforts, to supply her lack of service; as
when a drop of water is suddenly taken from the
ocean, all the circumjacent particles rush in to
supply the deficiency, and restore the level sur-

ing hand I am indebted for many judicious re-
flections; the public, I doubt not, will think wor-
thy of being subjoined.
Let it, first, be remarked, that in what is writ-
ten, the memorialist doth not design to exalt the
subject of these memoirs above the rank of hu-
man beings, as though by her power or holiness
she were what she is described; so far from it,
that she knew assuredly, that she had nothing of
good, by nature, more than another person; which
Mrs. Turner herself was not wanting to acknow-
ledge, in all her correspondence and conversation,
to the last day of her life, as the preceding pages
testify.
Inherent sin, hath put us all upon a level : so
that, though one may be more notorious than
another, no man has any thing of merit to boast
of before God. Our object is, to display the
riches of the grace of Christ: to shew, by an ex-
ample within our knowledge, to what a pitch
grace can rise; and to stir up the professors of
the Gospel, to be followers of her, even as she
was of Christ Jesus.
Secondly, we wish not by what we have writ-
ten, to discourage any who may appear to come
short of her standard. I say, appear; because all
are not in reality inferior to her in their attain-

Fourthly, The justness of the real Christian's
sentiment of his inability, and his disposition to
disclaim the glory of his own performances, do
not slacken his exertions for the glory of God!
He is like a child who feels himself deeply con-
cerned in the advancement of his father's interest,
and endeavours to exert himself for the promo-
tion of it! If zeal be enervated, and we aim
more at our own comfort and convenience than
his glory, it is a proof that our hearts are not
right, and that we are not steadfast in his cove-
nant! It best becomes the Christian to say,
'Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?' and to
make the end of one good work, the beginning of
another.
Fifthly, Our blessed Redeemer will acknow-
ledge the willing mind, which is disposed for his
service; and in the faithful discharge of it, will
increase our ability, and cause our usefulness to
grow with our years! If we are faithful in that
which is least, he will bless and increase us more
and more.
The preceding remarks are made to prevent
gracious souls under disadvantageous circumstan-
ces, and dejection of spirit, from yielding to dis-
couragement, because they cannot produce an
experience equivalent with Mrs. Turner's! But
they are not intended to be a salvo for the luke-
warmness and prevailing indifference of our mo-
dern professors of religion, who deviate as much
from the spirit of the Gospel, as they should from
the spirit of the world; and live as much under
the dominion of a carnal spirit, as they should
under the governance of the Spirit of Christ.

It ig no unusual case for people to admire what
they will not imitate; and to applaud the diligence
of others, while they themselves stand all the day
idle! It is to be feared, Mrs. Turner's shrine will
have more admirers than Mrs. Turner's self will
have imitators.
Beware, dear reader that it be not thy case?
There is no reason that it should! Be suitably
impressed with a sense of the love of Christ, thy
obligations to him, and the sufficiency of his grace
for thee; and thy soul will no longer cleave unto
the dust, but thy affections will be set upon things
above. When the apostle recommends a simili-
tude of mind to Christ, he exemplifies his humili-
ty, on purpose to shew,, wherein the correspon-
dence between Christ and the Christian should
consist! We assent to the propriety of the par-
allel, but object against being examples of it?
Hence there are so few who dare to be singularly
good, who are bold to be patterns of a life de-
voted to God; or, if not in providence set in the
sphere of a public example, ready to conform to
those who, being so stationed, eminently fill up
and adorn it.
How many Christians are there in affluence,
who, in proportion to their circumstances, do less
for the glory of God, than their fellow Christi-
ans in humble life I Why? Because their demands
multiply as their property increases ! They can-
not possess abundance, without living up to a
