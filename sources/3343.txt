The human body is a very complex
mechanism, and the intricacies of its
chemical action closeiy follow the an-
cient alchemical processes. The food we
eat contains varlous elements which are
extracted and recombined to form new
substances which.· are necessary to the
body's well-being.
We may ta~e the example of the
chem'ist, needtn:g four' chemic·a;i."s to form
a· particular· substance. · If. he has only
three, ' the s'ubstance:, 'cannot be formed.
rn the same' manner_ the body need·s all· of

principles and forces which flow through
affect the physical body.chemically and
cause the- various Mental and Spiritual
qualities and impulses of this type to
manifest. The zodiacal sign thus gives
us the key to the .tendencies and charac-
teristic~ of the, individual. This does
not mean that the individual is bound to
have the ailments peculiar to-his type.,
but it does mean that there a·re· .tenden-
cies in those directions whi'ch must· be
gua_rde_d-agains·t. This is done by' r.ight
thinking., rela'xation and · attention · to
the proper diet of the type .. :When one
knows the elements which a·re re.lated to
their chemical type they are; able to•eat
properly and thus maintain their .chemi-
cal balance.

.A . good breakfast is essential to
this type and may consist of fruit or
fruit juice, egg yolk, butter and crisp
toast. Crisp bacon or a small piece of
ham may be eaten without bad after ef-
fect.
Luncheon,
be a very light
etable or fruit
ing, Mayonnaise
if eaten at all, should
meal; consisting of veg-
salad with French Dress-
or simple oil dressing.
Dinner should always have consider-
able Iron and Silicon included; combina-
tions should be according to tables in
the book "VITAMINS AND ELEMENTS",by
Doreal (Pri~e $1.00) · ·
Balancing of the chemical elements
in each chemical type is very necessary
for the well being, as each type assimi-
lates certain chemicals with greater ease
than one of a different chemical type.
Foods which should be dominant in
the diet of this type are oranges, oats,
apples, figs, cherries, strawbe::rries,
eggs, peas, carrots, rice, cucumbers,
greens, cabbage, lettuce, onions, nuts
and asparagus.
The Calcium and Silicon type should
avoid situations which induce nervous
excitation, as it is very easy for this
type to become afflicted with nervous
disorders.
- 9 -
The Calcium and Sil-ic·6n- :type should
strive to relax both mind and body at
. all time·s,-thus a:voidirt-g- -the nervous ,d;ls-
orders this ·type ·is susoeptibl¢ _to; · ·
.• .. . .· . ~
This .t¥pe .'fi'hds its: best wo'rk in
sedentary pur,suits and· the,· avoidanc·e of
strenuous activity.
. . Accidents. are· most liab4-e: to happen
to the Calcium, Sil,icon type ....
during July
or August. Broken 'bones :··:are the_. most
Qommon kind: of -acciaent to··oefall 'this
type.
Excess·. of food should never be ·eat-
en. and ..above all no alcoholic stimu,lants,
as the·s:e tend to depress and make morbid
the C~lcium and Silicon type. ·
Proper balance of the e-lements in
the ·diet ·will make. ·this type witty a'r1d
bril.l.iant in. conve-rsatiori · arid· writing -
while· lack will cause just the opposite
effect. · · ·
This type often ,·aesires sweets in
.excess and .. therefore there · should ·be
rigid restraint ·practiced.·· ·This· · type
usually ·finds· . low of>,. medium· al t·itude
most beneficial. ·
Care should be taken to breathe
deeply as the high breath is ·the most
common in this type. D~:ep breath_ing Oxy-
genizes the' blood streani and tones down
·the· tendency to· nervousness·.
Plenty of Iron is very necessary to

·prevent the formation of tumors. It is
a,lso well to eat considerabJ~ Sulphur

.Those born under this sign are of
the ca.lcium .and Sodium type·. They are
::i'ubject to stomach troub1e,s, lung aff.ec-
tions, headaches, anemia, he·art: ~eak.;.
ness, nervous diseases, blood poisoning,
varicose veins and sensitive skins. This
goes not mean tha.t. this type ·must ha..ve
these, ·conditions .but t·he t~ndericJes to
contact these diseases are found in this
type; . they' are the ones'to be guarded
against. This type sho~ld avoi9 intense
emotional strain and relax mentally as
much as possible .
. .Fqods which should predominate in
the 'diet of this type are: grapefruit,
oranges, lemons, limes, peaches, grapes,
prunes, cauliflower, asparagus, lettuce,
egg plant, spinach, red cabbage, onions,
berries, beets, cocoanuts, celery, eggs,
...: 11 -
cucumbers, cheese,nuts,poultry and fish.
Calcium- is found in the bones and
blood, and without it there would be no
skeletal framework. People of this type
usually have st~ong bones, good teeth
and eyes. Too much Calcium should not
be eaten after forty years of age as it
accumulates in the hardening walls of
the arteries.
Sodium foods help to keep Calcium
in solution in the blood stream and pre-
vents Arthritis. If this type does not
have a sufficiency of Sodium, frontal
headaches, sinus trouble, burning or dry
skin, gas, slow digestion and constant
drowsiness are often present.
This type is usually healthier when
living in low altitudes and hot climates.
High altitudes and cold weather are felt
by them more than any other type.
They often are naturally Clairvoy-
ant and their intuitive powers are sure
guides if not repressed. Often they re-
fuse to listen to the inner voice, but
when they do so it is sure to result in
great financial gain.
Spring and fall are danger points
of heal th for this type and unusual. care
of the diet should be taken at these
times.

SULPHUR:AND
PHOSPHORUS.TYPE
March 21 ~ April 19
The Sulphur. forms the negative pole
of your body while the Phosphorus is the
posftive element. This means that the
negative-element mentioned is especially
·plentiful in the ·body While -the:re is a
corresponding lack of the positive ele-
ment. Usually the negative element ·is
so easily assimilated that fooas·predom-
·inant in- this element are not only un-
necessary but actually harmful •. However
this must be determined in- ,the individ-
ual as·sometimes one,-jus·t ove:r the line,
·has harmful effects: ..-· · ·
Phosphorus is very essential to the
higher intellectual faculties. It helps
t·o build and· repair bone, feed· nerves
·and nourish the ·brain. During the· pro-
ce·ss of: concentrated thought large quan-
tities of·. Phosphorus are consumed. A
magnetic nat.ure is usually accompanie·d
by·a large quantity of Phosphorus in the
make -up. It - ·nr an acid in sensitizing
the 9ra~n for the telepathic reception.
Whe:n··a body is lacking 1;n Phosphor-
.us one · may · have the sympto.I!}~pf. every
known·~.-
.-disease. It builds new"''cells in
the· brain and rebuilds broken down cells.
Constant lethargy is a sure symptom
~ 15 -
of lack of Phosphorus as gas and acid
stomach are. a sJgn ,of too much Sulphur.
Mental leth3:rgy· 1s a·1way.s a sure symptom
of Phosphorus deficiency. A cold is
also a sign of Phosphorus deficiency.

PHOSPHORUS
ANDIODINE TYPE
April ·20 - May 19
If you were born u,nder_ this sign you
are of the Phosphorus an·d Iodine type.
Phosphoru·s and· Potassium aid greatly in
the normal· functioning of the n~:r-vous
system. During the process of co_ricen-
trated thought large quantities of""'Phos-
phorus and Pot~ssium are used and if
there is a deficiency of these in the
body there is a cortsiderable reaction
upon the nervous system often causing
nerve congestion which in turn affects
various parts of the body including the
eyes. __
Skin eruptions are common··in this
type and. the eyes are often affected
through nerve congestion.
A sufficiency of Iodine in the di~t
is of extreme importance in the function-
ing of· certain of the Endocrine Glands,
especially the Para-Thyroids and Thyroid
in the throat. ·Lack Of proper function-
ing of these glands invariably causes a
toxic ,condition to arise in the .system
with resulting symptoms running from con-
stipation to extreme headaches and often
ailments of the stomach or digestive
tract.
The best PHOSPHORUS
FOODSare: egg
yolk, ·(which should be beaten in orange
juice,) whole wheat, cabbage, cucumbers,
- 18 -
cheese, tomatoes, celery,. ·caviar~ nuts
radishes, prunes, lemons and ·grapefru}t:
It should always -be rememoered that
Phosphorus is destroyed by cooking.
The best POTASSIUMFOODSare: car-
rots, cereals, radishes, apples, black-
berries, figs, cocoanut, potato skins,
water cress, · asparagus, olives, whole
wheat, endive and peas.
Iodine foods are very necessary for
your type as there is often a marked
deficiency in the Iodine assimilation.
It is impossible for you to·assimilate
an excess .. of·. Iodine. Tr.e best IODINE
FOODSare:- Lobster,shrimp,crab, oysters,
salmon, cod liver oil, potato skins, raw
egg yolk,· artichokes; mushrooms, straw-
be:i?ries, tomatoes, grapes, pineapple,
pears, beets, onions ·and peas.
Skin eruptions are usually minor in
nature· and are a symptom of toxic and
nervous conditions and will be ~ntirely
eliminated as,, that condition improves.
A very fine exercise for the skin is the
following:
EXERCISE
Center the consciousness above and
between the eyes on the Pituitary centEr.
Visualize a blue-white light and then
will for that to expand throughout the
entire face, neck and shoulders, con-
tracting -and expanding it a number of
times, as if you were literally flushing
the skin with light. In addition, in-

If .born under this sign you are of
Iodine and ·Iron type and certain foods
are very necessary for your well being.
Iron is the master element which·keeps
the life-force in harmony in the body.
It gives warmth, magnetism, mental en-
durance and vitality. In training your
body to absorb Iron, plenty of Oxygen is
necessary as Oxygen · attracts Iron. -We
therefore recommend that five minutes be
set aside morning and· night for deep,
slow inhaling and exhaling of fresh air.
- 26 -
Foods containing Chlorine, Sodium,
Silicon, Oxygen, Iodine, Calcium, Iron,
Potassium and Manganese are especially
re commended for your case •.. IRON FOODS
are: beets, lettuce, lentils, spinach,
peas, on.ions, asparagus, cucumbers, red
cabbage, yellow corn, green beans, whole
rice, prunes, peaches, raisins, berries,
grapes, cherries, .rye bread, nuts, egg
yolk and rare beef .
. Iodine foods are especially neces-
·sary for the nervous condition as Iodine
protects the brain and nervous system
from. body toxins. IODINE FOODS are:
crab, shrimp, lobster, oysters, ·salmon,
potato skin, artichokes, mushrooms., to-

A common mistake among most Spirit-
ual Healers is that they use one method
for the treatment of all ills. This
limits .-
tbem and is actually .,
the .reason
for their ·,failure in healing .many cases
whic ·h com~ to them for treatme _
nt. -,
· .-
..-,.
There are four planes of man's be -
ing which should be ,_
cqns idered in Spirit -
ual Heal1tig: the _physical, mental, psy -
chic .and spiritual planes. · A, iympfom
may appear ~n the -physical which has its
cause in any · one or more of .these f.our
planes. 'I'he treating of ·sympto _
ms.·.aione
will not . remove the cause. .·when the
cause is n.ot eliminated, even though tbe
symptom ha~ : disappea~ed~ :· the _patient has
not been really healed -fqr the same symp-
toms or another may later appear if the
cause is allowed to remain.
This large b6ok .is not w~itten· fof
the healer alone but may be· used for self
treatment as _well. Th_
e beginning student
in the study of Spiritual Healing may
read FOUR·..PLANES OF-HEALINGan _
d begin
immediately to practice its principles
and heal the .sick. All -students who wish
to learn how to heal, either themselves
or others, should read this book.
