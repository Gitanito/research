Anesthesia had been done by applying a gas via a mask. I felt like the mask was suffocating me.  It was a traumatic experience and felt like an act of violence.

Without transition I found myself instantly in outer space. This space was of an ebony blackness without the slightly bluish tone of our night sky. Nevertheless, this immensity wasn't opaque, nor was it dark. The blackness had an intrinsic quality of light that allowed one to grasp its infinite extent.  A multitude of stars filled this space. Their number was quite superior to the stars that one can see at night. They were very large, but distant, and having variable sizes. Their luminosity was a lively white, of a brightness that could be compared to a mix of chromium and diamond.

The object, that was more like an entity, was pulling me along this space with dazzling speed.  This entity was an enormous mass without defined form that was malleable and at least a hundred times bigger that me.  This form was of a pink color. It was like imagining a cloud that would have the consistency of firm chewing gum, whose form and outlines changed a little bit, while still keeping an integrity. You could also compare it to a kind of muscle made of modeling clay, endowed with its own will.  A light was illuminating us. It was of a power and whiteness that was almost material, but not directional. The quality of this Light was related to the one that gave the darkness an internal luminosity.  I desperately embraced the form that pulled me along with an incredible speed.  I was afraid that if I let go, I would find myself abandoned in this strange space. This pink mass was enormous, but it changed form between my arms, so I could squeeze a small protuberance against my body. However, I had to adjust my position regularly because this slightly soft matter kept changing shape and was escaping me in the long run.

I was scared, and this mass that I sensed like an entity, was exactly what a lifeline would be for a shipwrecked at sea. The enormous rate of speed was frightening.

This journey in a strange space continued without event or interruption until I woke up.  After surgery, as soon as I could speak, I only had one need.  I needed to talk about this experience. I remember that nobody, including my mother was interesting in hearing about my experience.  I say this experience, as I wanted to share and make them understand was not a dream, but was my having lived a strange experience.  As an adolescent, I remember having tried several times to talk about it.  I always had the desire and the need to communicate this intense experience that felt too heavy to carry unless I communicated it to another person. 

Even today, this experience remains with me.  It is not like a memory, but rather like an inclusion. It is not like a fragment between the events that fill my memory, but like a parentheses or like an anomaly in the course of my life.

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?       Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     Travelling through space was something I could have conceived at this age: but definitely not in this kind of space, and not hugging an enormous jelly-like pink entity.

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       Uncertain     I don't really know. But I recently read a book describing changes in life and personality for people having been through a NDE. I was astonished to discover that I have shared, and still do, so many particularities with them that there may be a link.

The experience included:       Presence of unearthly beings

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?       I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   No voice. But a strange being, quite.

Do you fear death after your experience?       I slightly fear death

Did you believe that our earthly lives are meaningful and significant after your experience?       Unknown

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?       No

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?       No

Were you compassionate after your experience?       Greatly compassionate toward others

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?       Unknown     Unknown

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?        Uncertain My relationships, as I have discovered much later, share many common points with people having experienced an NDE. But was it like that already before my own curious experience. This is hard to tell, I was just a child.  

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      Yes   The nature of the luminosity and the quality of the space's blackness cannot easily be rendered in words. But this is almost impossible to describe the rubbery pink â€˜entityâ€™.

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?     I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       No

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    At least I tried to; nobody ever cared to really listen.

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     No

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real     It felt more real than current life.

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was probably real     I know the intensity of the experience has been unchanged in my mind for decades. But I feel that, lately, the true emotion of it is fading a bit. Like an old picture, you have looked and manipulated so much that it has worn a bit.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No
