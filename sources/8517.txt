  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Although OBEs   provide compelling and frequently verifiable evidence of the NDE, studies of the   congenitally blind yield the most stringent test of the hypothesis to date. The   International Council of Opthalmology defines congenital blindness as a complete   lack of form and visual perception since birth, and is commonly referred to as   no light perception, or NLP.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Psychiatrist Stanislov Grof purports that sight in congenitally NDErs is   medically inexplicable. He states: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   There are…reported cases where individuals who were blind because of a   medically confirmed organic damage to their optical system could at the time of   clinical death see the environment….Occurrences of this kind… can be subjected   to objective verification.&nbsp;  They thus   represent the most convincing proof that what happens in near-death experiences   is more than the hallucinatory phantasmagoria of physiologically impaired brains  [19]    .

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   In accord with Grof, psychologists Kenneth Ring and Sharon Cooper decided   to conduct the most in-depth study ever undertaken of NDEs of the blind. The   objective of their study was to ascertain if the blind experience the same   veridical occurrences as the sighted. As Ring purposed,     the blind see for the first time in their lives during a NDE. However, they do   not retain sight when they return to their bodies.

  Using qualitative research, they   sought to determine if verifiable evidence supported their hypothesis that   experiences of the congenitally blind conform to the familiar prototype of   sighted NDEs. Their research   ascertained that the narratives of the blind were indistinguishable from those   of the sighted.             [20]    &nbsp;

  Thirty-one subjects were chosen   for this study. Of these, fourteen subjects were blind from birth, eleven had   lost sight before five years of age, and six were considered severely visually   impaired.&nbsp;  According to Ring and   Cooper, “The analyses of persons blind from birth… provide the strongest and   conventionally most inexplicable data pertaining to the proposition that the   blind may actually see during their NDEs and OBEs”.             [21]    &nbsp;   Thus, only cases of the congenitally blind will be presented.

  Ring and Cooper consider “Vicki”   to be one of the most compelling and verifiable cases of the congenitally blind   ever recorded.&nbsp;  Vicki was born blind   due to severe and irreversible optic nerve damage.&nbsp;   Asked in an interview if she has ever been able to see, she replied,   “Nothing, never.&nbsp;  No light, no   shadows, no nothing, ever...I’ve never been able to understand even the concept   of light.”             [22]       Thus, the visual components of her NDE are astonishing.&nbsp;   After a near-fatal car accident and suffering from brain damage, Vicki   was rushed to the hospital in a coma.&nbsp;   She recalls her experience by stating:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   And it was frightening because I’m not accustomed to see things visually,   because I never had before!&nbsp;  And   initially it was pretty scary!&nbsp;  And   then I finally recognized my wedding ring and my hair. And then I thought: is   that my body down there?&nbsp;  Am I dead   or what? They kept saying, “We can’t bring her back, we can’t bring her back!”   And they were trying to frantically work on this thing that I discovered was my   body and I felt very detached from it and sort of “so what?” And I was thinking,   what are these people getting so upset about?”             [23]

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Upon resuscitation Vicki described seeing her crumpled Volkswagen van.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Additionally, she “saw” herself floating above the stretcher and   travelling to the hospital’s roof, where she experienced a 360-degree panoramic   view of the hospital grounds.&nbsp;    Vicki’s surgical team later  verified her accurate description of the wedding ring and precise   account of both the hospital grounds and damage to her Volkswagen van.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   In a later interview, Vicki was asked to compare her dreams and NDE.&nbsp;   When asked if she had ever experienced visual perception while dreaming,   she responded, “Nothing.&nbsp;  No color,   no sight of any sort, no shadows, no light, no nothing.”  [24]    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Van Lommel finds Vicki’s story   astonishing.&nbsp;  He emphasizes,

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The fact that somebody who has been blind from birth as a result   of an atrophied eyeball and optic nerve…can nonetheless see people and   surroundings raises significant questions…&nbsp;   How does she do this?&nbsp;  This is   impossible according to current medical knowledge.”             [25]    &nbsp;

  It appears inconceivable that a   congenitally blind woman to whom the visual world is foreign and   incomprehensible, could describe objects and color with such crystal-clear   vision.

  Another of Ring and Cooper’s   remarkable case studies is that of “Brad”.&nbsp;   Suffering from severe chest congestion, Brad stopped breathing and went   into full cardiac arrest.&nbsp;  The   emergency room physician declared him unresponsive.&nbsp;   He was later informed that his heart and respiration had stopped for four   minutes.&nbsp;  It was during this period   that he felt himself floating to the ceiling and rising to the roof of the   hospital.&nbsp;  He described the   surroundings from the hospital roof as follows:

  I think that everything except   for the streets was covered with snow, thoroughly.&nbsp;   It was a very soft snow.&nbsp;  It   had not been covered with sleet or freezing rain…The streets themselves had been   plowed and you could see the banks on both sides of the streets.&nbsp;   I knew they were there.&nbsp;  I   could see them.             [26]

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   When later asked about his dream life, Brad replied:

  Generally--except for this one   near-death experience--my dreams have had the very same consciousness…as I’ve   had in my waking hours.&nbsp;  That would   be all my senses function, especially my sense of hearing and my sense of touch,   but all the other senses function, except vision.&nbsp;   In my dreams, I have no visual perceptions at all             [27]

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   How is it possible for the congenitally blind&nbsp;   to possess an acute, 360% visual field, the ability to recognize and   describe colors, objects, and the environment in fine-grained detail?&nbsp;   Indeed, it is incredible these individuals apparently transcend all   sensory restrictions.&nbsp;  Thus, the   question must be posed; does sight in blind NDErs actually depend on the eyes,   or is there a non-retinol explanation?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Kenneth Ring and Sharon Cooper   postulate the blind experience a distinctive type of transcendental awareness   termed “mindsight”. They define   mindsight as:

  A distinctive state of   consciousness, which we would like to call   transcendental awareness.&nbsp;  In   this type of awareness, it is not of course that the eyes see anything—how could   they?&nbsp;  It is rather that  the mind itself sees, but   more in the sense of “understanding” or “taking in” rather than of visual   perception per se. Or, alternatively,   we might say that it is not the eye that sees, but the “I”             [28]    &nbsp;&nbsp;

  Ring and Cooper are proposing a   theory in which the spiritual body transcends limitations of the physical body   and sensory organs.&nbsp;  In their model,   “the blind can see because, with the physical body temporarily inoperative, the   spirit within them can make use of the finer sense organs of the astral body,   which presumably are perfect, to gain temporarily a kind of vision they could   never have in life.”  [29]    &nbsp;   They hypothesize that the blind have access to an expanded supersensory   awareness not connected to an organic visual system. Their model posits the   existence of a non-local or “spiritual” consciousness.

  Over a century ago, noted   British scholar F.W.H. Myers arrived at the same conclusion proposed by Ring and   Cooper. He hypothesized:

  “I start from the thesis that   the perceptive power within us precedes and is independent of the specialized   sense-organs, which it has developed for earthly use.”             [30]

  However, skeptics of the   mindsight theory argue that “vison” in the blind is entirely brain-based, and is   the result of either retrospective reconstruction or dreaming. The chief   proponent of this hypothesis is British psychologist and NDE researcher Susan   Blackmore. She contends the blind are able to report visual descriptions of   their NDEs due to a combination of prior expectations, familiarity with hospital   procedures, sensory cues, lucky guesses, and most importantly, overheard   conversations.

  Thus, according to Blackmore,   what appears to be a visual accounting is actually retrospective reconstruction.   She states:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; It does not take much information from such sounds for a person to   piece together a very convincing and realistic visual impression of what is   going on. This will provide the best model they have and seem perfectly real.   They may have no idea that the model was constructed primarily from things they   heard…. We can only remember the general point that people who appear   unconscious may still be aware of some of the things going on around them and   they can easily build these up into a good visual picture of what was happening              [31]    &nbsp;&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Ring, Cooper, et al, argue vigorously against Blackmore’s reconstruction   theory. First, it fails to account for instances which could not be predicted,   anticipated, or is beyond comprehension in a blind world.&nbsp;   How is it that Vicki was able to accurately describe the physical   descriptions of her operating team, as well as the hospital grounds, when this   information had not previously been disclosed to her?&nbsp;   It seems implausible that Brad’s finely-grained and textural description   of snow is the result of retrospective reconstruction.&nbsp;   The more viable explanation is that Brad and Vicki experienced veridical   perception from a distance outside of the operating room.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Cardiologist and NDE researcher Michael Sabom further contends:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Thus, we have attempted to explain the apparent accuracy of the…NDEs by   prior general knowledge, by information passed on by another individual, and by   physical perception of sight and sound during semi-consciousness. None of these   possibilities have been found to be plausible explanations  [32]    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Blackmore’s “dream theory” is additionally contested by non-materialists.&nbsp;   Dreams of the blind have been researched for over a century. Findings   conclude that these dreams never include visual imagery.&nbsp;   Instead, they are experienced only via sound, touch, feel, smell, and   taste.&nbsp;  Hearing is the primary sense   in dreams of the blind, followed by feel and kinesthetic elements. Thus, the   crystal-clear vision of blind NDErs is radically different from their dreams   which lack any visual imagery whatsoever.&nbsp;   Ring further explains this by referring to the aforementioned cases of   Brad and Vicki. He states:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Again, if one did not know Brad was completely blind it would be almost   impossible to tell from his transcript…that this is a man who has no previous   experience with the visual world. Instead, he describes it using the lexicon of   a normally sighted person. His account, therefore, coupled with that of Vicki’s,   makes it very difficult to refrain from&nbsp;   concluding that under conditions of a NDE, seeing is native to and   self-evident in the blind.[33]
