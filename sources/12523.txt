It seemed like a welcome home party but as soon as the doctors got my heart to beat I was drawn back to the earthly world. Another time I saw a tree with a lot of books situated around it. Reading what was on the covers I saw that they contained all the knowledge and mysteries of existence. One very large book seem to consolidate what was in all the smaller books but when I tried to lift it was too heavy to carry and I decided to return later for it.  I saw a beautiful pulsating orb of golden light that I took for the Lord Jesus as it emanated perfect peace and love. I had no tunnel and meeting of a being of light I think because I was continually being resuscitated by the medical team.
