  		              		Experience Description   

    December 6, 2017, I was holding my newborn baby who had been born in the evening  via c-section. Our family was finally complete and I was savoring every moment, except perhaps the sleep deprivation. 

  On December 7, 2017, I was in absolute bliss.  The evening had come and my husband and I had just eaten dinner.  Then I relaxed against the bed and drifted off to sleep. Moments later it was as if someone had stood up onto the bed and kicked me square in the chest. I sat up clutching my chest, trying to hand the baby to my husband. He took the baby and ran to the hall to get a nurse. My heart was beating so hard that I could hear it in my ears and as I looked down, I could see it through my gown. I was vaguely aware that my husband was panicking, since  he could not get a nurse into the room. 

  Then the light began in the corner of the room near the ceiling, just behind my husband. My energy began leaving my body and flowing into the light. Then went  into the sky, flowing with the light. The light carried me off into space, beyond our universe and into a ball of light so bright that I could see it long before I actually reached it. Energy was flowing not only into the massive ball of light but from it as well. The light was  heading off in various directions through the multiverse.  I entered the ball of light that I now know as the 'central sun.' 

  I began having visions of my life, not just this one but every life I had ever lived. This life was the last vision I was shown. The visions were  almost like those pictographs I had as a kid. I was shown key points in my lives. I then was given visions of the bad things I had done, as well as the good. My good seemed to outweigh the bad; although in past lives, I had done some pretty appalling things. 

  Then I was shown a vision of the earth. Next I saw  the vision of myself approaching the central sun. It was as if I were being shown that the central sun was where all energy comes from and returns to, no matter where one calls home from lifetime to lifetime. 

  However, I did encounter familiar energies of loved ones who had passed from this lifetime and other past lives. They were not physical matter, just energy. I knew them instantly and they knew me, especially those who had been with me in other lives beyond this one.

 These visions came from within my subconscious and I understood things that I couldn't possibly have known. I was not met by another entity who claimed to be 'god.'  I suddenly was well-versed in the knowledge of how the universe works and where dark energy and matter come from. This has led me to research quantum physics to try to understand what happened to me.  

  I was shown a small portion of what my future holds as my  purpose in this life was revealed to me. My purpose is to love and be loved and to teach and be taught. I am to be a beacon for those like me, those who have experienced a life-altering reality and are seeking understanding. I was to raise my children to lead from their hearts and accept all of humanity to help them seek balance and understanding. 

  Everything was hyper-realistic, perhaps more real than I have ever known reality to be.  I felt like I was there for years and was sure I had died that day in the hospital holding my baby. 

I tried to check in on my husband and kids, only to realize that only moments had passed. I realized time is an illusion and our energy can communicate without word and it can travel without measure of speed. 

  As I checked in on my family, my newborn daughter cried and I could see my husband  crying as well. I then violently slammed back into my body and felt intensely everything they were doing to bring me back. I had 4 IV's inserted in various places throughout my body as the nurses injected me with adenosine, three separate times to try to get my heart rate back down from 225 bpm. It worked  on the third try and my heart rate went back down to a normal 80 bpm instantly. I looked over at my husband and told him I loved him and he said he loved me back. 

  They then wheeled me down for a cat scan. I was diagnosed with  a pulmonary embolism that had lodged in my heart for several moments before traveling to my left lung. The type of embolism I had was referred to by the nurses as a 'widow maker' because 98% of people do not survive them. 

  My NDE has made me more grateful for the time I get to spend with my loved ones. It also  seems like a double-edged sword as I can vividly remember how calming and serene I felt in the light. In the year since my experience I have met some amazing people with similar experiences as mine, and some vastly different with similar parts to their story as mine. I know there is life after life and that while I am in this lifetime, it is my duty to share my gifts with others.  I am also trying to  raise my own vibration and those around me through frequency IE creativity and talent in order to awaken their soul to its greater purpose.  

  My life since the NDE has been a bit traumatic since the people I have talk to  so far cannot understand what I am talking about when I try to explain my NDE to them. Some think I have gone mad .  I also notice that I do not connect to people the way I used to. Now much of the human race disgusts me and I have severe anxiety trying to understand their 'issues.' Many times their experiences seem so trivial and self-centered to me that my heart actually aches. I have also some new gifts  since my NDE. I can hear, smell and even taste electricity. I hear a humming or buzzing, when an appliance or device is plugged in, even when it is turned to the off position. I can hear peoples thoughts sometimes and get visions of their lives. I can read people's energy and have deja vu often. I dream in vivid color and often leave my body again, as if checking on things at home and reaffirming that what I experienced is real. I remember things from the first 5 years of my life that I never knew before or had never been told.

 My whole life has completely turned around  and I have found it to be a blessing and a curse as I do not relate to the average person the way I used to. I do hope my story can help others who may be experiencing or have experienced what I went through. Brightest blessings to all who may come across my story.   					  

    

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 December 7th 2017  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Surgery-related.  Childbirth       Life threatening event, but not clinical death.   Blood clot lodged in my heart and then moved into my left lung.  

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Both pleasant AND distressing  

Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes    I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   before my NDE, I was blissfully unaware of much of the energy around me. Now I can feel and sense it all. For better or worse.  

  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         From the second I entered the flow of light and nearly every waking moment afterwards.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     I thought I had been gone for years. And thought to go 'check' on my children to see how their lives were going and if my husband was okay. Only  moments had passed on earth and I the medical staff was trying to stabilize my body. That is when I slammed back into my body.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       The colors were brighter. I didn't just experience my NDE, I sensed the experience. Every vision I was shown was so brilliant and the light was so blindingly bright it took my mind a few moments to embrace it.  

  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      My hearing has always been fine but now after my NDE, I hear things others do not such as electricity. Even the earth  has a hum.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, but the facts have not been checked out  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     my energy went into a stream of light energy that originated in the upper corner of the room and traveled through to space, almost like a moon beam but a thousand times  more intense.  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

  Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes     My maternal grandmother and my sister who passed away when I was 15 were very much with me. My father let me know that there was nothing to fear, but did not communicate much. My children from past lives seemed elated to have me there and I experience immense euphoria in their presence. Several life-mates shared visions of our time together with me.  

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   After much research and comparison with others I believe I traveled to the central sun of the multiverse. I know it was not our sun.  

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     Best described as the central sun of the multiverse.  Into the central sun is the best answer I have.  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Sadness, euphoria, excitement, calmness, fear, concern and an overwhelming sense of self.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Relief or calmness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Happiness  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe     Even though I had studied forensic science, and had a relatively good understanding of biology. Quantum Physics became abundantly clear to me and how the multiverse works. Still figuring out some of the details but yes, I feel like I got a crash course in quantum physics.  

  Did scenes from your past come back to you?         I remembered many past events.     I was shown key points in my life and times when I could have died but managed to avert disaster with seemingly slight changes in plans or circumstance. I now remember things that happened during the first 5 years of my life. I have spoken to my mother about them and she is astonished because  she had never told me about these things and didn't even remember herself until I mentioned them.  

  Did scenes from the future come to you?         Scenes from the world's future.     Yes. I saw my children at various points in their lives and thought I was being shown because I had died and would miss them growing up. I saw the earth cleansing itself with massive storms and waves in areas where too much dark matter had collected. I saw mass amounts of people were beginning to awaken to things from their past lives even though  they had not experienced an NDE. I saw the fall of government systems as we know them. There was a return to innocence, only after the earth purges herself of a vast number of dark energies. The world population was greatly diminished.  

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Unaffiliated- Nothing in particular- Religious unaffiliated.   I have always been spiritual and knew something must come after death. But I never followed a set religion.  

  Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I no longer believe in any religion - Just a collective consciousness and oneness with those who are awakened like me.  

What is your religion now?         Unaffiliated- Nothing in particular- Religious unaffiliated     

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I had always considered myself a spiritual person. I took a bit from most religions and left what didn't resonate. I now KNOW that religion is an illusion and that we would all be better served to just operate from a space of love and acceptance. There is already a staggering amount of dark energy and matter in the multiverse. religion sometimes feeds into that. Only light can drive out dark. But our own darkness is something we must have full mastery of first in order to operate from a space of unconditional love. There is no heaven or hell. It is all a reward and punishment system to keep the masses in check. There is no singular entity that is GOD. GOD is neither Male nor Female but a source of divine light and energy.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I do not relate to most of mankind anymore. Their 'issues' seem so trivial and self-centered to me. It makes me anxious to interact in large groups of people whom are not 'awakened.' And I can only handle most people for brief encounters at a time. I am not rude or inconsiderate to them I simply have withdrawn and refocused my energy and time on those who are worthy of it.  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   nothing physical. Everyone I encountered was in energy form. Pure soul. I encountered loved ones from this life and my other lifetimes, I knew them instantly and they knew me. No words were spoken but we communicated with ease.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     I saw many of my past lives. Good or bad. And let me just tell you not all were easy to watch. And somewhere so amazing it was a humbling experience, knowing who I have been in previous lives allows me now to understand with more certainty who I am today and my purpose here and now.  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     there is life after life and energy does not die. Though it can be drained. Be careful who you spend your time with and what energy you put forth in the world. it has a ripple effect.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     All life begins with a spark from the central source. At the time that conception takes place there is a visible spark of light, that creates the body's soul. A spark of divinity. We all hold a piece of the divine within us.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I am a way shower. A bringer of light. Enlightenment for those who wish to hear me. Some refer to it as being a lightworker. And it is vastly different than simply being an empath.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     I am to tell my story and share with those who seek the answers I have and I am to also seek answers from those who have the answers I need.  

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Energy never dies. It simply changes form and frequency.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     This life is all such a infinitesimal portion of who we are. Who we are today is a result of all of our previous lives combined? We are all made of the very same stuff as the stars themselves. Those who cannot see this and may never awaken to this truth are not ascended enough to see such truths. Their time will come perhaps in this lifetime or in a lifetime in the distance. We all awaken at some point in time when our soul has enough experience to see things just as they are. Until then most will simply be content and blissfully unaware of exactly who and what they are. Those of us who have been shown have a duty to help those who come after us in the process. Paying it forward is the best way to reach a collective consciousness.  

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     I was shown the difficulties that I have gone through in this life and my others in order for my soul to enter this new dimensional way of being.  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     I was in communication with life partners from my other lives. Shown key points of our lives together. Saw the lives of my other children. (I have hundreds of children. I was shown that even though I am married to my second husband that he has been my life partner in several other lifetimes. Which makes a lot of sense as we had a lot of coincidences when we met and have endured through some pretty amazing challenges in this life.  

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     Clairaudient, clairsentient, and I dream as if I am traveling outside of my own body like I did during my NDE. I have dreams that come true and experience deja vu' often. I can hear, smell and even taste electricity flowing through devices and appliances even when they are not turned on but are plugged in. The earth itself even has a distinct sound.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes We are so much closer than we were before and he has been my confidant.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   I feel like no matter how much I try to express my experience I sound like a crazy woman. And I forget to add certain details. How do you explain centuries and millennia worth of information in a few paragraphs? It is impossible. I will perhaps someday write a book or two.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  Even today a little over a year later remember with blinding detail. so much so that when I try to explain it others cannot fathom what I am saying is true but look at me as if I know something, they don't based on the detail they give and my ability to answer their questions of my experience with scientific detail. things they can verify with little research.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     Clairaudient and clairsentient. I dream of things that eventually happen and travel outside of my own body while sleeping. Electrical interferences. I feel like these questions are redundant. Answering the same things over and over.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The understanding of Quantum physics. the understanding of how life works and the knowledge there is life after life.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    5-6 months. I was admittedly freaked out and thought perhaps I would be committed to a psych ward.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   I always heard about people being met by loved ones and seeing GOD or Jesus. Seeing themselves over the top of their own bodies. Never heard of anything like what I experienced.  

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     From the second I reentered my physical body I remembered every detail and in my moments alone (like inside the CT scanner) would replay portions of what happened and try to understand how it could be real. But I was wide awake the whole time it was not like a dream. it was so much more real than reality has ever been.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     Even today I have dreams and go answer my own questions with things that I experienced. Reassurance of sorts. I have also connected with others who have experienced what I have just not gone as far as I did.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   In dreams I can go back and seek answers, sometimes all I have to do is think the question and am shown an answer..  

  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         These questions tend to ask the same questions over and over and creates a sense of redundancy. The subject may even fail to complete the questionnaire due to frustration.

E-mail from Dr. Jeff:  

    Thanks for sharing your remarkable experience with nderf.org!  It will be posted (anonymously) in the next several days.  I am sure that it will be informative and inspirational to a vast number of people.

     I have several questions that I would appreciate your answering.  

    In what  you shared you state “I suddenly was well versed in the knowledge of how the universe works and where dark energy and matter come from.(Quantum Physics is how I now research what happened to me looking for an explanation.)”  Any additional comments that you could share about this would be greatly appreciated! 

    You also discuss your remembrance of several past lives.  Any further details that you could provide about that would be greatly appreciated!  Did you receive any information about your prior lives that could be verified today? 

    Thanks again for sharing your remarkable NDE!       

    Kindest regards,    

       -Jeffrey

    I could see dark energy all around that seemed to make the flow of light energy that mich brighter. It seemed to push outward and advance into spaces that were void of light almost like oil spilling onto water. It had its own flow like the light energy did, but no distinguishable source from my vantage point. It almost seemed infinite. And dark matter, clusters of darkess that seemed coagulated together somehow like rivers or veins of some sort. I instantly sensed that dark matter was a manifestation of dark energy and any space that had a lower vibration was targeted by its flow.   

     When I was a child I began to dream about a woman whom I believed everyone was calling “Ava or Ana” have had dreams and seen through her eyes my whole life. She seemed quite regal and had women at her side that cared for her. I always saw through her eyes and on several occasions caught glimpses of her in ponds or reflective surfaces. It turns out her name was actually Aya, also known as Sherida... She was my very first incarnation here on earth. She was the “wife” ( more like companion though) of Utu (also known as Shamash). She is known now as a goddess but guite literally was warshipped for her knowledge and gifts. She did not see herself as a goddess but was quite gifted. Gifted with clairaudience and clairvoyance. Things the Mesopotamian people could not fathom so she was warshipped along side her husband. People flocked to her for advice and guidance. She helped as many as she was able. Dedicating her whole life to those who sought an audience with her.  Often helping her companion perpare for battles even. 

    Most of my lifetimes after Aya were quite normal with the exception of Lucrezia Borgia and we all know what a legacy she left behind. It made me realize that our darkness’s are part of our big picture. The one trend that I did notice with my past lives and this lif is my love for Art. Creating art and viewing or hearing it. Drawing, painting and sculpting are my main passions as well as photography and in other lifetimes I have been well known artists but not “famous.” My lives have been fairly “normal” for the most part. I also find it ironic that my whole life ai ahve been refered to as an “old soul...” Apparently people can sense the age of my soul?   

     I do hope these answers are sufficient enough. And you may publish my name with my experience if you like. And I wanted to ask if I will be given a link to access my testimony? If you have any further questions or beed clarification, please feel free to ask.   

       Warmest regards,

    Telesa L. Hill

    Thanks for your detailed additional comments!  With your permission, I would love to post you additional comments with your experience that is now posted on nderf.org.  That is fascinating that you recall a prior lifetime as Lucrezia Borgia.  I had to Google that.  How detailed is your remembrance of that life?  Is there anything that you recall from that life that could be verified today?  Thanks again for sharing!     

  Best regards,

  Lucrezia Borgia was rumored to have incestuous relations with her brother Cesare. They were close but lovers they were not. She was however bitter over her failed marriages and men tried to seduce her all of the time. She poisoned them with opiates lol... Many men fell to her beauty. She hated her father. And that is why she tended to have such unsettling relations with men. I will have to think of something that could be verified today.... Perhaps her locket? She kept opiates in it and I wonder if there may still be residue within it...? I wonder if there is perhaps a way to track death records of men who came into contact with her? I would be fine with you posting my additional comments with my experience. I think I seriously need to write a book. Lol      

    Warmest regards,
