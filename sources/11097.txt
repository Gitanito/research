  		              		Experience Description   

    I was 4 and almost 5 years old. My experience was not near-death, it was death.
  
  I was in my bed because  I had been very ill and had fevers hitting 104. Mom says I hit 105 at some point. I remember being lowered into a cold tub of water when my mother was frantically trying to bring the fever down. I would hallucinate the same thing every time my fever got that high. The ceiling would start bouncing back and forth like a rubber band. It would begin lowering down on me. I would cry out thinking I was going to be crushed. Looking back now, it was probably seizures.  I was also vomiting every hour or less. This went on for 3 days. I still had held nothing down.   Mom took me to the hospital when she realized that I was getting worse.  
  
  I was immediately rushed back to the emergency room beds.  The room became busy with medical staff rushing around. They were asking mom questions and she answered while  watching me. She looked worried and was trying not to cry.  I felt so tired. I just wanted to sleep for a while. I remember telling everyone I was feeling much better. The sounds in the room started to get a hollow echo to them. I  wanted to close my eyes, so I did.
  
  The voices in the room continued to echo. I noticed my toes were touching the foot of the bed. I thought, 'Wow! I am a big girl!' I felt so proud. I opened my eyes to look, and when I did I was looking at myself. I was blue and lying on a gurney. My eyes were slits. There were people around me frantically working. Mom was crying as she looked on.
  
  I wasn't upset or scared. But, I was a little confused. I knew I didn't have a body. I felt like I was part of everything and everyone. I just floated up and could see other rooms. I later detailed conversations that there is no way I could have known. I lifted out of the hospital and continued ascending. I began browsing through time. I saw events from my short life. I later detailed things that occured before I could even talk. These were events I should not be able to remember but I do and in great detail. As I kept ascending, I felt at peace. There were no questions or unknowns. Time wrapped in on itself.  There was no past, present, or future as we see it here.  Everything happened now and all at one time.  I felt  no fears or worries.   I began drifting towards a beautiful light and  I wanted to touch it.
  
  Suddenly there was a pop. It felt like I was attached to a cord when someone grabbed it and jerked me down. I descended almost instantly.
  
  I   don't remember much after that. I don't even remember going home. 
    

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 1980  

NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes   Illness   CPR given     Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function)   I died. Cardiac arrest, stopped breathing.  

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes.  Dad was talking to someone in the waiting room.  I didn't have specifics on that.  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        Normal consciousness and alertness.   It was normal. I was not hallucinating. I actually felt better during this experience, oddly enough.  
  
  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         When we first got to the hospital,   I felt better. I didn't feel hot anymore and I was aware of my surroundings.  Then I got sleepy.  
  
Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning. Time wrapped on itself.  Or maybe our earthly perception is wrong?  It seemed like things were not linear. Time had no beginning and end; there was only now.  It was all at one time and  wrapped like a burrito touching the other side.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I noticed nothing different outside of the hallucinations I had prior at home.  

  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.   There was a hollow, echo sound to everything.  
  
Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No       

Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         No  

  Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   I ascended toward it. I thought it was the sun, but it was not so bright that I could not look at it.  
  
Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         No       

  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         I felt calm, peace, and understanding.  
  
Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Happiness  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe.     I understood time  and I understood our connections to one another. I know I had no more questions. Everything was revealed but the details I can only remember a little of. I remember the connections to one another, and the stream as I call it. We are all connected to each other.  We send vibrations down as we think and choose.Those vibrations effect the next person and so on.  We dip into that stream of connections and we can retrieve information, like a psychic might do for example.  
  
  Did scenes from your past come back to you?         I remembered many past events.     I was able to accurately describe my nursery from before I could  walk.  I drifted in time. I watched myself watch  Sesame Street on TV, and play with the toy you fit round or square blocks into the holes. I just banged on it. Then my mother walked in from the right.  She is beautiful.  I do not understand the words she is speaking, but her voice is soothing.  She picks me up and takes me into the kitchen to the left. The cabinets were painted yellow and my crib was in there. I can see a connecting bedroom,  which my mom verified later that it was her bedroom. Some of the cabinet doors had been removed so I could have access to my  books and toys that were placed there.  I also saw her white VW bug she was driving at that time.  She verified all.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

  Did scenes from the future come to you?         Scenes from the world's future     I saw the paper and it was year four thousand and something.  I cannot remember the exact date now.   I was running and looking over my shoulder.  I saw the sun shooting balls of fire from it. The sky was a beautiful color but then it turned dark. There were locusts and we were in the dark hiding, scared and without food. This was a time frame happening over many  years but I saw it pretty quickly.  

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Unaffiliated- Nothing in particular- Secular unaffiliated.   I was too young to understand such a concept as God.  At this point in time, I had not considered such things.  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

What is your religion now?         Christian- Other Christian     

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I did not have beliefs or preconceived ideas about this. I did not know what death was yet.  I didn't know we could even die when it happened to me. So, I had no religious bias.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         No       

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     We are all connected to one another and create vibrations with our thoughts and choices.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.  I saw the light, and was at peace. I was about to touch the light when I descended back to my body.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         No changes in my life       

  Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Uncertain. I was too young to know if they did.  I just have always been like this. This is who I am.  

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Uncertain   I can't describe in detail because I cannot describe in words.  I am not trying to be funny.  Trying to describe the feeling of not being in my body is very hard to describe.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.    

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain.     I am able to tell people things that surprise them and me even.  I don't know if I could before. I just rattle off the words and images that pop in my head and have very high accuracy. I just say what is shown, but I don't know what it means to the person.  

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          No,it is what shaped who I am. I don't have many memories before that event.   

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    When I was an adult at least 20 years.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real       

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was probably real       

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         none.
