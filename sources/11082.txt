  		              		Experience Description   

    I was awake and driving from one job location to another; on the busy streets around the airport in Cairo, Egypt. I was in a hurry and the street was only two  lanes in opposite directions.  So, I tried to pass the truck ahead of me, only to find out that there was another truck heading straight for me from the opposite side of the street.
  
  I was horrified and completely believed I was going to die.  The  next thing I knew, I was above the scene around 10 meters up. I was looking down at my car below as it was avoiding the collision and being driven safely through the two trucks.  I was not afraid as I looked down. After my car had passed through the danger, the first thought I had was "Sh*#t, but who is driving?" Immediately, I  was back in the car holding onto the steering wheel. 

   I was very confused by what had just happened and didn't understand it. I was wondering if I was supposed to die? Was I imagining things? And most of all, I wondered who  drove that car through those trucks, because it wasn't me!
  
  I let the experience slip to the back of my mind and only understood it later when i heard about NDEs.
