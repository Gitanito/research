I did not think I would ever have a drug overdose but it happened. First, I saw the bright light, unlike any light on Earth. I went through the light at a very fast speed and felt no pain, no hunger, and not even any gravity. As a matter of fact, I don't think people on Earth ever feel the way I felt. But it's hard to explain. Then I saw this black curtain open to a color I had never seen here on Earth. I couldn't see anyone there. Then I heard my grandfather's voice say 'There he is!' in a very happy tone. The next thing, I was back in the tunnel of light feeling gravity again. It felt awful. I didn't want to go back. Then I was back on Earth, hovering in the corner of the bathroom near the ceiling, looking down at my dead body, and at my friends, who were freaking out. They had tried to revive me and had given up. Then I was back in my body in a cold bath tub filled with freezing cold water and ice.

I noticed I had an erection and had taken a dump in the bathtub. When I stood up, I looked at one of my friends who had turned white as can be. I felt very confused and asked what is going on. He said I had been dead for twenty minutes. I put my clothes on and drove home. I did not feel the heroin at all in my system; I was scared and could not believe what just happened.

I can remember this event just like it happened yesterday. I have no clue why it happened. But, because of this event, I have no fear of death. Many times I wish I had not been sent back here, as it seemed much better where I was going.
