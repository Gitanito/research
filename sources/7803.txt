            		Experience Description:   

Early evening (dusk) I was traveling in light traffic at about thirty mph, an oncoming vehicle came round a bend and didn't correct her steering. She crashed into me whilst doing at least fifty mph. I wasn't aware that I'd been hit, but I was aware that I wasn't where I was.

I didn't feel any pain, I thought I was totally conscious but I knew I wasn't. I tried to move but couldn't, I tried to talk but couldn't, I knew that I couldn't see but didn't care. I was so totally at peace that I expected something to happen so I stood, laid, sat. I wasn't actually doing anything but I was there. It's impossible to say for how long because there was no time associated in this place, I was there and I was enjoying myself. I asked the question to myself or anyone who might be listening, 'Am I dead?' I was told by my granddad (passed over four months previously), 'No!' I asked 'What happens now?'

I regained consciousness and was lying on the ground surrounded by the people that had pulled me from the car, in tremendous pain and in shock.
