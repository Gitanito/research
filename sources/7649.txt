  		              		Experience Description   

    It happened when I was playing kickball in school's sports field. I was unconscious after I fell over.

  The next thing I knew, I was out of my body. I experienced a dimensional shift while my body was unresponsive.   My soul was hovering in the sky and watching classmates get together around my body before I woke up. I still vividly remember one of my classmates who pinched my philtrum and what they discussed about my incident.  I would have died if I had mass brain hemorrhage, or if my brain swelled enough to cause all the brain cells to die. 
  
  As for my experience, it seemed like I was getting closer and closer to the ground while playing kickball. Then, I was moving at a lighting, high-speed.  I did my best to comprehend what was happening as I  traveled through a tunnel. I watched the smiling faces of my classmates that rotate one slide after another like many pieces of shuttered mirrors. (I still clearly remember three of their faces today) I had trouble breathing and my body was in so much pain. Still, the whole experience continued until I reached the end of the dark tunnel. The light became brighter as all the pictures disappeared. I felt myself moving toward the light at a high speed. Once I entered the light, I found myself floating into a very peaceful state in the black universe.  I was formless;  like water evaporating and then dispersing slowly. I was very relaxed, peaceful, and comfortable. I could not get enough of this serene feeling. 

As I write this, I still can experience that state of relaxation.

  Abruptly, I again experienced what seemed like a dimensional shift in the movie. My soul was floating up above the school sports field. My spirit was up in the air watching my body lying on the grass with all the classmates around me. One of them tried to resuscitate me with a pinch on my philtrum. (the area above the mouth)  I lost all the memories from the fall after I woke up. I could not recognize the people around me, and didn't know where the restroom was in the school. Gradually, I recovered my memories after an hour.  I could barely walked home with my vague memories two hours later. 

 The above description is still crystal clear to me as I could remember it as now.

While my soul was up in the air, I saw my body laid on the grass. I was surrounded by my classmates and one of them who tried to revive me using the Acupuncture pressure point on my philtrum. I heard what they were talking about my accident.
