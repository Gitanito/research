  		              		Experience Description   

    I am a war veteran who decided to join my brothers whom I lost overseas. I shot myself in the head with a shotgun. While I was in a coma, I had a bright light speak to me. The light asked me if I wanted to go or stay. I said to tell my kids bye and that I love them. Then I woke up. It had been over 2 weeks.
