I was having my gallbladder removed.  I remembered I was leaving my body and there was a ‘big white angel’ taking me away. When I turned around, I saw my body lying on the operating table. Doctors were working on me.  The angel asked me if I wanted to stay or go with her. I told her I was not ready to go yet.  The next thing I knew, I was waking up from the surgery and I asked my doctor if I had stopped breathing on the table for little while and he said, ‘yes.’ He asked me how I knew. I told him, I saw the whole thing when an angel came to me, and was ready to take me with her.  I told the doctor I could see exactly where everyone was, what instruments were used and the locations everything was in.  Anyway, my doctor told me Penicillin was fatal for me and to never let someone give it to me again.
