Wow well we&#39;re really in the deep end of
the pond he&#39;s asking what is the
connection between what some people
would call the ascended masters or very
enlightened beings who left their bodies
or in other dimensions and realms and
these extraterrestrial beings I would
say it&#39;s the same connection but perhaps
more intimate that humans can have now
the difference is if you are an
interstellar civilization you&#39;re if you
guys could be quiet out there thanks if
you&#39;re an interstellar civilization
you&#39;re going to be able to go from one
star system to another only if you have
become cosmologically competent now what
do I mean by that I wrote a paper back
in 1995 I believe called ETS and the new
cosmology that talks about this expanded
view of the cosmology of a universe that
includes other dimensions and other
realms that are increasingly conscious
and this explains a lot of the
experiences people have when they&#39;re
near an extraterrestrial vehicle where
it will have an effect in consciousness
and they will begin to have similar to
the ending of the movie contact that
Jodie Foster was in where it&#39;s almost
like in a dream state why is that
well when you start dealing with
technologies that permit not only
transportation but communication beyond
the light barrier let&#39;s look at it that
way
beyond the box of space-time then you&#39;re
moved into a world that is increasingly
conscious and in the thought realm and
for that reason those civilizations that
are interstellar are very very familiar
with what we would call remote viewing
the ability to have the mind
taken into this field of consciousness
that&#39;s non-local and see other points in
space or time but also other beings in
other worlds can that be done
electronically yes the big secret in the
intelligence community that I learned
back in 1994 was that the remote viewing
programs at the CIA and NSA had that
were based purely on meditative and
consciousness efforts what was the part
they were happy to let that people know
about but that in nineteen believed it
was 1956 a man that I met before he
passed away had invented some
electronics that would permit some of
these operatives in the intelligence
community to electronically hook up and
literally see and through other
dimensions and consciousness other
places and that was the high end of the
so-called remote viewing programs that
were based on transdimensional
electronic systems which I understand
very very well and which have been used
since the 50s so if we have that in our
classified programs I&#39;m quite sure that
an interstellar civilization has things
that would be generation 100 of that and
that would mean them answering your
question in a way that has some
foundation and logic that their ability
to perceive these other dimensions and
realms would be augmented now that is
limited by the level of consciousness of
the perceiver so what that means is
everything is is really in that sense
based on what your level of development
and consciousness is so if you have
developed the ability to be in a state
of transcendent cosmic awareness you can
perceive a certain amount beyond taste
space and time if you got to the point
that you can see the finest aspects of
that what in the Vedas are called
celestial perception you&#39;re going to see
be able to sense that if you can see
beyond that
then you&#39;re in this what&#39;s called the
state of unity consciousness and it goes
on and on and that&#39;s just the beginning
but so that those abilities of
perception are very much dependent on
the level of consciousness of the
perceiver so it would vary with
different civilizations and what their
capabilities are but certainly their
capabilities would be beyond what we are
able to actuate through atnt in other
words there&#39;s a linear electromagnetic
communication system and you know years
ago when I was doing had this meeting
with the CIA director and his wife which
they subsequently denied but luckily I
have the documents I have sitting right
here that can prove it happened
I always joke in Washington how do you
know they&#39;re lying their lips are moving
I more truth to that then people want to
realize it but at any rate the the the
wife the CIA director was a scientist
and was the chief operating officer
National Academy of Sciences and she
asked me over dinner we were there I was
three-hour meeting almost my wife was
with me and can verify this and she she
asked not that question but she asked
how are these civilizations
communicating across the vastness of
interstellar space and I thought oh god
do I tell her the truth and lose all
credibility or do I tell her something
that sounds scientific but that I know
is rubbish and I decided then that I
don&#39;t care how high the person&#39;s status
in society was if they asked the
question they deserve an honest answer
so I explained to her that and I think
this is something people really have
needs to understand about these
technologies a great launching point
from these sort of technologies they can
move ring us to the next level of our
civilization to eliminate poverty
pollution etc and so on and the
geopolitical morass of the oil politics
but when you start dealing with these
Sciences on
or a profound level you break into these
transdimensional physics that deal with
communication systems and I explained
that look at our galaxy the Milky Way is
only one of billions of galaxies it&#39;s a
very average spiral galaxy the Andromeda
galaxy is two and a half million
light-years away which is the distance
of a beam of light going 186,000 miles
per second would travel for
two-and-a-half million years but let&#39;s
take our own galaxy is 100,000 light
years across so that&#39;s the distance a
beam of light going 186,000 miles every
second every second is 186,000 miles for
a hundred thousand years meh okay but
that&#39;s just our own galaxy so let&#39;s say
that there&#39;s a star system a thousand
light years away which is only one
percent of the distance from where we
are because we&#39;re on one of the outer
spiral arms of the galaxy 1% thousand
light years using your cell phone or a
radio wave anything at the speed of
light it would take a thousand years to
get a signal there to that home planet
and a thousand years to get an answer
back it&#39;s the time since the birth of
Christ to gate say hello how are you
fine thank you very much so what I
explained to the to the CIA director and
his wife is that speed of lights just
too slow so the communication as well as
transportation systems that allow for
them to be here are something that are
beyond linearity that cross over into
nonlocality what Einstein called the
spooky phenomenon where things can two
things materialize and so kind of appear
at one at two different places instantly
and that kind of thing
so this nonlocality in physics when it&#39;s
put into a reproducible electromagnetic
system can then cross through these
dimensions so that the star system a
thousand light years from us and Earth
can be get it in resonance
there&#39;s no distance linearity is gone
that line between here and there is gone
and you&#39;re going not through a wormhole
but you&#39;re actually going through these
dimensions that are folded within time
and space where the speed of light time
mass and those things do not factor into
the equations does that make sense and
therefore one of the things that I
discovered years ago dr. Robert Woods is
one of our disclosure project witnesses
who had worked with McDonnell Douglas
that was then bought by Boeing he was
very interested in an assessment I did
in 1991 back in my misspent youth so
when I was in my 30s and in this paper
which was called the comprehensive
assessment of the UFO ETI
extra intelligence subject the sort of a
white paper and it&#39;s in my first book
that you can get on on our around the
internet or at our store and in that I
described TAC technology-assisted
consciousness and c80 consciousness
assistive technologies so that you can
have a technology as I was saying that
assists consciousness and thought for
example that was what in that 1956
invention that this genius that I admit
had invented that ended up getting
bought out by a front company for the
CIA and can do or you can have your
consciousness assistive technology safer
communication so it goes both ways so
it&#39;s the interface between thoughts
stuff say a fault Tron instead of an
electron and this dimension but it&#39;s
very very sophisticated technologies and
that&#39;s what these civilizations are
using for communication but that also
means that they&#39;re traversing into these
other dimensions that some would call
that you might experience when you have
a near-death experience or when you have
a lucid how many people had a
said flying dream where you&#39;re flying
almost everyone
well you know actually what&#39;s happening
in those lucid flying dreams and
particularly if it crosses over into a
precognitive dream you&#39;re actually in
your that aspect of yourself that is
conscious and the so-called body of
light is actually no longer restricted
by the confines of the body and
space-time and therefore you can
actually traverse these kind of worlds
of light and see what&#39;s going to happen
tomorrow but imagine be able to do that
on a reproducible basis with electronic
assist all right and your whole thin
spacecraft does the whole thing because
it transitions at a linear space-time so
that would mean that the ability to
explore those other dimensions would be
greatly augmented it doesn&#39;t mean that
it&#39;s more than we can experience because
people have experienced near-death
experiences and other dimensions and
what-have-you either in meditation or
near-death experiences or just
spontaneously and it&#39;s sort of an
awakening that happens in consciousness
but it also means that if you&#39;re an
interstellar civilization you&#39;re going
to have a means to assist with that and
augment that and facilitate it on a
reproducible basis but again even for
them the perceptual capabilities are
limited by the level of consciousness of
the perceiver because you get into finer
and finer and finer and finer and finer
dimensions someone once asked me how
many dimensions are there I said how
many numbers are there between zero and
infinity so it&#39;s infinity within
infinity within infinity there&#39;s not any
limit so what we&#39;re trying to explore in
our little project that well and of
course this is actually how I got
involved in all these issues is six
months after my near-death experience I
was I had learned meditation because I
was going wow this is I was raised very
devout atheist science and we were very
devout atheists
you weren&#39;t allowed to believe in
anything you couldn&#39;t put in
has to and and so when I had that
experience it was so profound and it was
so cosmic and awareness that I began to
learn meditation techniques and I picked
one that was a sort of a Vedic mantra
technique and I began to have all these
experiences and I was up on this
mountaintop in North Carolina and I was
going to meditate and one of these
spacecraft materialized and just before
sunset same spacecraft Ising when I was
eight or nine years old in Charlotte
North Carolina as a little boy and I
went oh they&#39;re back I didn&#39;t think
anything else more about it and it was
it was there and it just vanished it
didn&#39;t fly off I went oh cool so I was
there meditating and sitting on this
mountaintop in October it was freezing
up there I had a jacket on ski jacket
and I went into such a beautiful state
of consciousness that I lost all track
of time there was no time transcended
into this pure conscious State sitting
up at five thousand feet up in the
mountains of North Carolina I loved I
think it&#39;s my chair account part
Cherokee Indian so I had this great love
for those mountains so at the end I kind
of stood up and and I looked at the sky
and it was like this this beautiful fog
came behold what a beautiful universe
God has made and with that I went into
the same state I was in when I had my
near-death experience but I was in my
body and then there was this little eet
beside me that touched me on my right
shoulder and all my hair stood on end
now that&#39;s when I had some hair and or
more hair and it was longer I mean this
is 1974 so it was a wonderful experience
but that was my I didn&#39;t understand the
physics of what had happened in terms of
the contact that ensued and followed but
now I do and I think that it&#39;s an
amazing science that unfortunately you
know we&#39;re just beginning to emerge out
of sort of a Newtonian fossil fuel
trying to come out of that but there&#39;s
so much more progress that&#39;s been made
in classified scientific programs now
you can imagine hearing a little bit of
this while
these folks at the CIA call some of
these technologies WS FM weird science
and freaking magic and why the parent
group operating on the NRO document
that&#39;s the first document in the Obama
briefing is from the National
Reconnaissance Office which is runs all
the super-secret spy satellites and
you&#39;ll see it says Maj IC magic is one
of the compartmented operations cosmic
ops magic ops boom that&#39;s an authentic
document so and it because use and
there&#39;s an area of Nellis Air Force Base
which people mistakenly call area 51 no
one in the know calls it that by the way
nobody that is called dreamland and this
document mentions dreamland MOC a
military operating center and one of the
reasons why that crept into the PAR lots
of people doing experiments with these
electronics is that when you&#39;re in that
state using those it is like having a
lucid flying dream
that&#39;s where dreamland came from now
there&#39;s a little secret that you won&#39;t
hear many places but it&#39;s it&#39;s it makes
sense if you understand what a lucid
dream is if you understand what could
the conscious aspect of the cosmos is if
you understand what thought really is
and thought forms are it all begins to
make sense and so when McDonnell Douglas
old man McDonald of McDonnell Douglas
asked I&#39;m getting to another point here
asked dr. wood to go and look at this
subject he started looking finding cases
and he found a number of cases where
people had contact events with objects
and this is way back in the 60s when
this was happening more often because
there weren&#39;t the weapon systems we have
now targeting extraterrestrial vehicles
they people would have these experiences
and in broad daylight sometimes there
was one case that he looked into I think
it was in the Baja California where
craft at Lander of these beings outside
of it they had a little they were very
much in this dimension and they had a
little black sort of like a
communication thing that would do
correctly communicate with thought
instead of with words but not just like
oh I&#39;m gonna guess an intuitive
telepathic you know the amazing Kreskin
nonsense but I mean zap just like but it
was clearly into the oral cortex coming
from these electronics and doctor was
aerospace engineering guy Cornell guy we
you know reported this back and there
was a reason why a lot of the early
McDonnell Douglas secret stuff the
phantom works and they had a lot of his
planes named after these sort of
concepts I forget the names of them some
of them it&#39;s all the various dark you
can look it up but but that goes back to
the 60s and you know here we are 50
years later you know still dealing with
rather primitive concepts of physics so
that&#39;s why we when you start thinking
about civilizations let&#39;s say a
civilizations been around for hundreds
of thousands to millions of years longer
than we have which in a universe is 14
billion years old is no reason why not
and you take the technological advances
that have been made in the last hundred
years not just the things you know
people know about but these classified
them programs and then you put that on
an exponential curve for hundreds of
thousands to millions of years every
manifestation of that civilization would
look like magic
more so than if you went back and
visited Thomas Jefferson two hundred
years ago out here at Monticello and
showed them him an iPhone or something
this would be less spectacular than the
normal everyday world of these
interstellar civilizations which is why
we have to have a sense of humility
scientifically that the fact is that
we&#39;re just on the very beginnings of
scientific and conscious exploration and
everyone thinks history is over and
every generation of scientists thinks
they know everything but we don&#39;t and
and and so there has to be
the acknowledgement that were just
beginning on this journey now in the
realm of mystic literature and people
who had experiences in consciousness I
think many things that have been
portrayed as miracles actually have
could be they they&#39;re certainly
miraculous to the people who saw it but
there&#39;s probably an understanding both
in the science of consciousness but
maybe even in technological sciences
that would explain it
that people don&#39;t want to hear this part
but because this steps on some
theological toes no you know so one of
the issues about disclosure of this
whole issue you&#39;re not just stepping on
the toes of the orthodoxy of science
macroeconomics and technology but you
might step on some theological toes when
you start moving into some of this
discussion which is you know get you in
hot water very quickly but and I&#39;ve been
in enough of the pot water to know where
of I speak in terms of that paradigm but
you know it&#39;s okay I remember years ago
I was meeting with a man at JPL he
tracked me down at a restaurant actually
Jet Propulsion labs and he started
talking to me about the fact that he had
seen the non sanitized images from Mars
where there were structures very ancient
structure and even Buzz Aldrin the
second man to walk on the moon has
recently said we need to go back there
and see some of these obelisks these big
objects that appear to be artificial he
can&#39;t talk about what he saw at the moon
because he&#39;s been told he can&#39;t but he
can talk about these other things that
he&#39;s looked into which is why he has
begun to speak about it so this is a
very interesting case because I said
well why don&#39;t you at least disclose
that because some of these structures
apparently are very ancient as in in the
millions of years possibly old now that
would make sense I mean the Earth&#39;s been
here for 4.6 billion years the solar
system is billions of years old so
millions of years is not that much and
he said oh no he says because even
though it&#39;s not something that would
point to any contemporary he said if
that knowledge was disclosed it would
collapse the fundamentalist and Orthodox
belief systems of every religion on
earth and I said well good
it&#39;s childhoods in I mean it fine he
says no no you don&#39;t understand how
powerful those interests are and this is
a scientist saying this this is not
someone at the Vatican so part of the
problem with disclosure is that it opens
up a whole bunch of issues that people
would rather just not deal with and and
this is one of them including this
question of other dimensions and
intelligence that isn&#39;t that aren&#39;t
physical now this is a really important
thing about the issue people get into
what I call cosmological indigestion
they can&#39;t digest so you can have an
experience with an interstellar
civilization that has transdimensional
capabilities that cross into this realm
of thought and consciousness and
what-have-you
that&#39;s what we do and we go out under
the stars with my team but then you
could have also an experience with
intelligences that are not from a star
system but that are from just other
dimensions and realms that are purely
conscious in the worlds of light as it&#39;s
called and you could be forgiven for
confusing the two because depending on
how they manifest now I had a hilarious
conversation with the senior theologian
at the Vatican a few years ago he&#39;s
actually in the disclosure project
material but we didn&#39;t have good
translation for Italian and he said look
he says angels don&#39;t need flying saucers
I said yes of course but there&#39;s a point
where when an interstellar vehicle
resonantly shifts into that dimension
depending on their capabilities they get
very close to that realm don&#39;t they he
said yes so there is an understanding of
it but most people will conflate one
experience within another so that
anything that is weird or goes bump in
the night they&#39;re gonna think is the
same phenomenon when it&#39;s a multiplicity
of phenomena plural
