  		              		Experience Description   

    My partner and I were walking calmly down the street during the midday. Suddenly I started to feel tachycardia.  My eyesight went blank, my hearing stopped, and finally my legs gave way.  I passed out and woke up in another dimension.  

  I tried to open my eyes, but the light was so bright it was hard for me to open them.  I was in a completely white room that was empty.  The light was shining so brightly it made me slowly close my eyes while I enjoyed the warmth and calm feeling without any worries.
  
  My memory retained only the last minute of my existence in real life.  I remembered how I had gotten there, yet I didn't remember my parents,  my  name,  anything or anyone.  At the same moment, I thought , 'Is this the afterlife?'  I wasn't afraid at any time, but I was unsure what would happen next.  I was beginning to let myself be carried away by that warmth and feeling of comfort. Then I saw a man approaching  the white room at considerable speed.  He opened a  large brown door  for me. It was like I blinked with everything  dark and suddenly woke up.
  
  I woke up, as if I had been under water for 2 minutes. I was gasping for air.  According to my partner, I had been unconscious for only 15 seconds.   For me, it was as if hours had passed. 

  As a result of that event, I think that life is death, and death is life.    					  


Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 2013  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        No.         I was out for a walk with my partner  when I suddenly felt tachycardia.  Other I hadn't suffered any trauma or anything like that.  I was fine, and then suddenly everything started to happen.  
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

  Did you feel separated from your body? Yes.    I clearly left my body and existed outside it  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   It was a new event and nothing like it had ever happened to me.  And while I was trying to grasp this mentally by searching for what it meant, my consciousness and state of awareness were really confused.  
  
At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         From the first moment.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Faster than usual  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Time seemed to go faster or slower than usual.     When I first woke up in the room trying to make sense of it all, time felt as if it had passed slowly.  As I started being able to open my eyes more and get used to that light, time suddenly began to accelerate.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       Before the experience I was able to see everything normally.  During the experience I had trouble seeing because the light kept me from opening my eyes completely.  

  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      Before the experience, I could hear perfectly.  Seconds before passing out, I stopped hearing.  During the experience I heard absolutely nothing.  
  
Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain     When I passed out, I woke up immediately in that white room.  When I left the room, I went through a large brown door.  
  
Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         An unusually bright light  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes     

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         Some unfamiliar and strange place     In a completely white room, filled with a warm bright light.  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Comfort, warmth, uncertainty.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Happiness  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe     Little by little I started making sense of it and wondering, 'Is this the afterlife?  It feels so good.'  
  
Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Catholic   I'm a believer in God, but I never thought I would have the privilege of seeing the afterlife.  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

What is your religion now?         Christian- Catholic   My religious beliefs didn't change.  What's different from before is that now I'm able to confirm that there is something more.  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     While I was in that dimension, I had the sense that everything I'd been thinking about in real life was being answered before my eyes, whether or not I remembered my being and my loved ones, if I was doing it from my beliefs.  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     While I was in that dimension, I had the sense that everything I'd been thinking about in real life was being answered before my eyes, whether or not I remembered my being and my loved ones, if I was doing it from my beliefs, and therefore it answered what I had been thinking about and wondering for so many years.  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I believe that it's possible for a supreme and/or intelligent being to exist in the afterlife. During my experience I only saw a man I didn't know, and he opened the door for me.  
  
Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   While I was in that dimension, I had the sense that everything I'd been thinking about in real life was being answered before my eyes, whether or not I remembered my being and my loved ones, if I was doing it from my beliefs.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     As a result of my experience, I view the purpose of earth is to have us see and feel all the emotions and sensations; in order to become immortal intelligent beings we first have to be mortal.  That's why life is death, and death is life.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists          During the experience I started to wonder, "Is this really the afterlife?'  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Slight changes in my life.     It triggered the fact that it answered my concerns and years of questions about why we are here, where we are going, what our purpose is, if there is an afterlife.  It also changed the fact that I am not afraid of death anymore since the body is a carcass.  What matters is where I will go and not what I will leave behind, because ultimately whatever I might obtain and whatever I might create in my  life on earth won't help me at all in the other dimension.  I won't remember anything or anyone, only my beliefs.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  Earlier memories of experience are selective because something has to happen so that your mind can retain the event.  By contrast, the event of my experience, which was something completely new, my mind was capable of retaining down to the smallest detail.  That's why today, 7 years later, I still remember all the details.  
  
Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          That entire event has really impacted me a lot, from the moment I opened my eyes and felt how that warmth embraced me and made me feel so comfortable and calm, and the fact that at a given point a man approached me beside a large brown door and opened it for me.  From that first moment when I woke up in my life on earth, I have been wondering, 'Was it not my time, maybe?  Do I have a purpose in this life on earth?'  And I have kept asking the same question to this very day.  
  
  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I told it to my partner, who was beside me when it happened to me, after all, but I saw no real reaction showing any belief.  And that's normal. I didn't believe it until I saw it.  I've only told it to a few people.  I suppose that we're the ones who have the answers, who've had an NDE, and that it's best for us to share it with the very people who have been through this experience.  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   Remakes about NDEs have been made constantly in movies or on the Web, and because of that I had some idea about it.  

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I saw this experience as real as life itself.  I didn't see my body, and I wasn't able to move or even hear. I could only see.  That warmth began to paralyze you, little by little, with feelings of comfort and calm.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     My beliefs haven't changed.  Before the experience I thought there was something else after life, and when I woke up in another dimension, all my questions were answered, and others were generated for me, like, 'Why did I wake up again in life on earth?  What is my purpose in being in life on earth?'  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         From the time the NDE event happened to me, I have been reading statements by individuals who underwent the same experience, and I realized that the great majority suffered a trauma, hematoma, or were undergoing surgery at that precise moment, and they passed into another dimension immediately.  But by contrast I was walking calmly down the street with my partner when I suddenly felt tachycardia, my eyesight went blank, my hearing stopped, and finally my legs gave way and I passed out.  
  
Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         No
