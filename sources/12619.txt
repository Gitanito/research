Seemed like a neighborhood and I was shown around to all the people I loved and missed and they were all so happy.

I remember being surprised like Oh, Hi - wow you're here how nice and smiling very broadly.

Remember my dad sitting on a stoop of sorts with his hand outstretched to me. He was many years younger than he was when he died and I was just a toddler reaching up to him.

I know I saw many people but can't remember who they were specifically except for my dad.

Next thing I know the emergency medical technician is saying 'You died and we brought you back.' I said I saw my dad and that I couldn't die now because it was Christmas time and that would be too difficult a memory for my daughter to bear every Christmas.
