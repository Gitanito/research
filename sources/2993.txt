I
have noticed you

heaven.
And you must
be
careful now, that the ad-|

feel trials because you think some other one has
received
a
little more notice from me than what
you have.
I
have given unto every one

you, accord

my wisdom, and according
to
the trav

of
sufferings that you have pass-|

through,
in

Mother. This has been my intention from the
beginning:
I
have not left this for mortals
to
do,
as
some caviling spirits have already supposed.
But
all
these individual notices, and presents
which have been handed forth, now

truly cleansed at last. I did require your Elders
to stand as witnesses between your souls and
me your Eternal Parent.
And many of you have said within yourselves,
“Why should Holy Mother require a witness, if|
she knowethall things? Why should the Elders |
be required to tell her, whether they felt satisfi

they that faithfully

at

to
God,
by
placing their desires upon heavenly things,
will
be
able every night
to
load my angels with

sweet smelling incense,
to
bring before my
throne, and this they never fail
to
do when
a
soul has thus spent
its
time through the day.
So does Holy and Eternal Wisdom, who
is
one with the GREAT FIRST CAUSE of all cre

to
notice the most minute
action, when performed

obedience

righteous will.

do
these sacred things|

of
the

it

writings from them and keep them until they

in
strict obedience
to
their teaching; and humbly
seek to have the sacred treasure returned to
them again.

SECTION VI.
The last and parting words of instruction and kind entreaties of Mother Ann, to her thildren in
the Temple, written upon the roll of parchment with Holy Mother's Word.
My dear children, who have found favor in the
sight of your Holy and Eternal Parents, and to
whom my soul is bound in golden cords of love,
will you condescend this once, with open hearts
to-hear, and understand the word which my ||

dear children, these things cannot feel any more

righteous arm shall lead them on in his eternal||
wisdom. A cloud of light and pillar of fire,
shall show to the surrounding nations, where

the power of the Most High does dwell.
So dear children, remember these my words,
and this my promise unto you, when ye hear my
voice no more, Though you should be cast
into the midst of a fiery furnace, or into the
depths of the foaming ocean, if you will walk in
true obedience, this ARM, that is stretched out,
shall be your sure and never failing protection.
But on the other hand, it will be withdrawn and
heavy judgments will ensue; the Canaanites
around Zion shall have power to scourge and
afflict, to scourge and afflict, and lead into cap
tivity many of the inhabitants thereof; yea
they will surely become as briers in their eyes,
..and as thorns in their sides.

from this my faith,
I
never will depart, either

Now, dear children, can you, with your

a
full purpose
of
heart, never
to
depart from, one

or

to

I

Come gather near, my little ones, and
hear the words
I
have
to
speak.
I,
for one, says
Father,
do
believe and know, beyond
a
doubt,
or
a
possibility
of
a
contradiction, within my
||
own soul, that this gospel
is
the power
of
God
|
unto salvation,
to
all such
as
believe and obey it.
2.
I
also believe and know, that God
in
his
infinite goodness and mercy, hath opened the
|
*=
|heavens, for several years past, with that degree
of
his
brightness and power, that none within
|Zion's borders, who were bound
in
their sins,
and would not come
to
judgment, could help
fearing the searching rays
of
his eternal light,
and fear and tremble
in
his presence.
"
|
3.
Nay, nay,
O
heavenly Parents!
I
never will
slight the holy and sacred work
of
God, which
in
SAC1RED COVENANT, 37.
his condescending mercy and goodness, has been
bestowed upon his people, for a few years past.
I never will, nay, I never will to the end of my
days, I never will say, I never will speak, that
aught of the things that have been sent forth
from the heavens above, were the inventions of
man or of woman, or that the Instruments were
instructed by the Ministry and Elders, to bring
forward -these things in the name of God, of
Christ or Mother, or any of the heavenly hosts.
4. I never will flinch and stop to hearken to
the influence of the devil. But when I find my
fallen, corrupt, filthy and exalted nature, is
closely ground on every hand and side, by rea
son of the sacred Laws and Orders which have
been sent forth from heaven, in this late manifes
see; mortals calling upon the sacred pewers of
the
|
heavens above
to
sanction their own views and
natural feelings
/
this, though cloked under
a
divine sanction,
is
what
l
call BLASPHEMY.
8.
Now my beloved gospel relations,
I
am
your Father,
I
am your friend; and
as
such,
I
now warn you against these evil and wicked
spirits, which will come
up
against Zion,
as
a
flock
of
hungry vultures
in
quest
of
prey.
9.
Thus
do
I
forewarn
all
my children
of
the
days and heavy pressure
of
evil, which will
surely come, when our voices shall cease
to
be
heard, sounding among you, and the doors
of
communication shall be closed between those in
time, and those
i
i

is
now meas

to
be
established
in
Zion,
I
will not suffer
the wicked and benighted influence
of

to
overshadow my soul, and cause
me
to

or
