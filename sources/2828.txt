Introduction
STROLOGY was one of tl1e seven sflrrc>r1
sciences cultivated by the i11iliatcs oi tlle
ancient world. It was stuuied and prac-
ticed by all the great nations of antiquity.
The origins of astrological speculation are
entirely obscured by the night of time
which preceded the dawn of history. There are tra-
ditions to the effect that the astrological science was
perfected by magician-philosophers of the Atlantean
Period. One thing is evident, Astrology descends to
this late day adorned · with the diflcoveries and em-
bellishments of a thousand cultures. The history of
Astrology is indeed a history of buman thought and
aspiration. The readings for the planets as given in the
cuneiform tablets of Sargon are still used by the
astrologers of this generation. Only such modifications
and changes have been made as the shifting foundations
of cultural standards necessitated.
Two distinctive schools of Astrology have been
recognized from the beginning of the historical period.
With the decline of the late Atlantean and early Aryan
priesthoods and the profaning of their mysteries, what
are now called the sciences were separated from the
parent body of religious tradition. Astrology and
[iii]
INTRODUCTION
medicine were the first to establish independent insti-
tutions. The priests of the state religions no longer
exercised a monopoly over the prophetic and medicinal
arts. Beginning with Hippocrates new orders of
soothsayers and healers arose who were entirely igno-
rant of the fundamental unity, yes, identity of the
spiritual and physical sciences.
The division of essential learning into competitive,
or at least non-cooperative,. fragments destroyed the
synthesis of knowledge. Frustrated by division and
discord, the whole s_
tructure of education broke into
inµumcrable discordant parts. The science of medicim
divided from its spiritnal source detei·iorate9. into thE
quackery and leechcraft of the Dark Ages, a conditiol)
of affairs so sorry that the Hermetic physician Par-
acelsus was moved to say, "Fortunate is the man
whose physician dnes not kill him.'' Astrology was
likewise corrupted into horoscope mongering. Divorced
from its divine purpose it drifted along, performing
a halfhearted and poJntless work which consisted for
the most part of the bleating forth of dire predictions
and the compounding of planetary salves against
the itch.
A small group of enlightened and educated men pre-
served the esoteric secrets of medicine .and astrology
through those superstition ridden .centuries we now
call the Middle Ages. Of such mental stature were the
Rosicrucians who honored Paracelsus as one of the
chief of their ''mind.'' Through Paracelsus and
[iv]
INTRODUCTION
the Rosie Cross th':! spiritual secrets of nature were
restored to the chi~f place among the ends of learning.
Knowledge was interpreted mystically and the profane
sciences were reflected as merely the outward forms of
inward mysteries. The secrets of mystical interpreta-
tion were concealed from the vulgar and given only to
those who yearned after things which are of the spirit.
The Mystical Divinity of Dionysius the Areopagite.be-
came the textbook of an ever increasing number of de-
vout and God-loving men and women who saw in
all outer forms and institutions the shadows and
semblances of inner truth.
The modern world which saerificed so much for the
right to think .has grown wise in its own conceit.
Educators have ignored those spiritual values which
constitute the priceless ingredients in the chemical
compound we call civilization. Material science has
become a proud institution-an assemblage of peda-
gogues and demagogues. There is no place for myst~­
cism in the canons of the overschooled. Hypnotized by
the strange fascination which matter exercised over
the materialist, modern savants ignored the soul, that
invisible reality upon which the illusions of the whole
world hang.
It was Lord Bacon who said, ''A little Jmowleoge in-
clineth men's minds towards atheism, but greatness of
knowledge bringeth men's minds back again to God.''
This wonderful quotation expresses the tempo of the
modern age. A disillusioned world saddened over the
[v]
INTRODUCTION
failure of material things is crying out again for those
mystical truths which alor-z explain and satisfy. The
return of mysticism brings with it a new interest in
astrology and healing.
Mysticism brings with it a new standard of inter-
pretation. To live up to the exacting demands of a
mystical interpretation all branches of learning must
be purified and restated. To the mystic, astrology is
riot merely predic-tion or even giving of advice, it is a
key to spiritual truths to be approached philosophically,
to be studied for its own sake.
Although science has classified, tabulated, and
named all the parts and functions of the. body, it can-
not describe or explain what man is, where he came
from, why he is here, or where he is going. In the
presence of ignorance concerning these vital subjects,
it is diffimllt to appreciate an elaborate learning in
secondary matters.
The initiates of antiquity were concerned primarily
with man in his universal or cosmic aspect. Before a
person can live well he must orient himself, he must
know in part at least .'the plan of living. With this
knowledge he can then cooperate with "the plan," and
the philosophic life recommended by Pythagoras is
merely to know the truth and to live it.
Scientists looking for the cause of those energies
which motivate and sustain the world have decided by
a process of elimination that these causes must lie in
a subjective structure of the universe, the invisible
[vi]
INTRODUCTION
sphere of vibrations. So the modern fancy is to
ascribe to vibration all that cannot be expl&incd in any
other way. The moment we acknowledge the universe
to be sustained by an invisible energy which manifests
through the law of vibration, physics becomes super-
physics, physiology becomes psychology, and astronomy
becomes astrology. Astrology is nothing more nor less
than the study of the heavenly bodies in the terms of
the energies which radiate from them rather than
merely an examination of their appearance and
construction.
The original Rosicrucians held to a theory generally
discarded by men of science and now known a~ the
microcosmic theory. Paracelsus was the most promi-
nent exponent of this concept of universal order and
relationship. He said, "As there are stars in the
heavens, so there are stars within man, for there is
nothing in the uniYerse which has not its equivalent
in the microcosm" (the human body). In another
place Paracelsus says, "Man derives his spirit from the
constellations (fixed stars), his soul from the planets,
and his body from the elements.''
It is quite impossible for the most highly trained
scientist to examine with any adequate appreciation of
values the whole infinite diffusion of the cosmos with
its island galaxies and incomprehensible vistas of
immeasur&ble space. Yet the whole of the pageantry
of worlds is evidently dominated by all-sufficient laws.
Man himself is more compact though possibly in other
[vii]
J:-<TRODUCTION
ways hardly less difficult to analyze. The cells i.n the
body of man are as countless as the stars of heaven.
Countless races of living things, species, types, and
genera are evolving in the flesh, muscle, bone and sinew
of man's corporeal constitution. 'l'he dignity of the mi-
crocosm gives the scientist some sense of the sublimity
of the macrocosm. By the use of astrology it.is possible
to discover the interplay of celestial forces between
the m11crocosm and the microcosm. The centers in the
physical body through which the sidereal energies
enter were discovered and classified by the ancient
Greeks, Egyptians, Hindus, and Chinese. There is
great opportunity for work in examining not only the
physical body itself but the auras which extend from
the body forming a splendid garment of cosmic light.
The last few years have witnessed exceptional prog-
ress in that branch of medical science which is called
endocrinology or the study of the structure and func-
tion of the ductless glands with research into thera-
peutic methods of treating derangements thereof. These
glands are now accepted as the regulators of the phys-
ical function, the governors and directors of bodily
structure, profoundly significant not only in their
physical reactions, but also their effect upon mentality,
emotion, sensory reflexes, and the so-called spiritual or
metaphysical functions. Nearly all endocrinologists
admit that the pineal gland is the most difficult to un-
derstand a::n-a-the-most difficult to treat. It can now
generally be reached only by treating tlle other glands
[viii]
INTRODUCTION
over which it acts in the capacity of genern1is8inrn.
The physical functions of the glands are now fairly
well classified but there will unquestionably be much
revision of the present opinions. Physicians arc will
ing to admit that tht> function of the glands does not
end merely with their effect upon· the body but scien-
tists are not prepared to make any pronouncements
beyond the field of material reaction.
It is especially significant therefore that through
a combination of clairvoyance and astr"ology it is pos-
sible to examine the ductless glands and discover the
metaphysical elements in their functioning. The mod-
ern clairvoyant uses the same method for his work as
was used by the initiate priests of the ancic·nt world,
and like those older adepts he makes contributions to
the . sum of knowledge which are only discover-
able to the materiulist after ce1~turies of ponderous
experimentation.
The work which follows is a spiritual record of the
functio11 of the pituitary body and pineal gland. I
feel that the researches carried on by Mrs. Max Heindel
are a definite contribution to the subject of endocrinol-
ogy that should be preserved for the use of all students
of medicine and the occult sciences.

CHAPTER I
POLARIAN EPOCH
So God created man in hilf own image, in
the image of God created he him; male
and female created he them.-Genesis l :27.
N THE STUD-Y of the origin of man and his
prehistoric state we are cdnstantly stumbling
against unexplained mysteries. a.ncl especially
when we read from the materialistic viewpoint in the
Old Testament, which is the most wonderful history of
man. We are then forced to scale th~ most formiclable
rocks of doubt. When we read between the lines. how-
ever, or view the past with an open mind then this book
of Genesis is a mine filled with gems of the rarest kind.
In The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception we are taught
that the world is divided into seven different states of
consciousness. Beginning with the densest we have
the physical matter of which man's physical body is
made. Although it may not be cisihle tu tire pti;'S-i.c,1!
senses yet we know and have positive proof that there
is something within and about us of a subtle nature,
fin~r than our physical yet interpenetrating it, which
we cannot see even though we feel it. Electricity is a
force which man can feel but cannot see. He knows
that the atmosphere exists yet he cannot see it. And
[13]
14 ASTROLOGY AND THE DUCTL"ESS GLA?-."DS
so we may sense and know that this subtle rarified life
exists. We view the storm and we feel its-force. We
can see the raindrops as they descend to earth, and we
are told by the scientists that this ra.in is drawn up by
evaporation, causing the moisture in the clouds. We
know that the wind blows-;-wdeents-rerreshing influ-
ence. Science has a reason for all these changes
and explains these atmospheric· pbenomPna . from
materialistic .investigations.
The .occultist explains these phenomena from the
higher or spiritual viewpoint by telling the scientists
that the great invisible regions from which the winds
come are peopled with higher intelligences and that
great spirits control the ·elements; that they have be-
ings who carry out their orders; for instance, the spirit
of water has its workers, the undines; the spirit con-
trolling the winds works through the sylphs. So .we
have the elements which man must recognize as exist-
ing, all·with their invisible leaders and workers who
exist in God '.s great . universe, as well as poor mate-
ria:listic man who denies everything which he cannot
see with his physical eyes, and who
0
when .he is asked to
explain these great mysteries cannot do so.
Now, as·stated _
before, The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Con-
ception recognizes seven ·different worlds. What shall
we call them Y. Not matter, 'for we c1n·only recognize
as matter what man can see with his physical sight.
But there are ·six higher states of consciousness; let
us call them by the names which were given to Max
Heindel by the great beings who saw fit to entrust him
POLARIAN EPOCH 15
with this knowledge: the physical w.orld, the desire
world, the world of thought, the world of life spirit, the
world of divine spirit, the wqrld of virgin spirits, and
the world of God. Now, these.are only names and they
do not explain the conditions of tMse,different states.
Let us take for illustration a teakettle filled with
water. We know that the air filters through this
water. If we place this kettle of water upon a cake of
ice the water will become hardened and in a little while
we shall have ice. But let us place this same teakettle
of ice on a hot stove and in a short time the ice melts and
we have steam which disappears into the atmosphere
and is lost to the visible sight. Where has it gone? Some
place where the incredulous eyes of the materialist
cannot follow, but the occultist can trace it. He knows
that nothing in God's universe is lost.
l\Ian, who is God's most p13rfected work, is composed
of every element found in these seven great worlds.
Man as we find him today with his wonderfully .de-
veloped and complex mind and body was not made, as
many misread the :fi.rst chapter of Genesis, out of clay
and in one day, but his present stage is the outcome of
ages and ages of growth. We follow him as he enters the
arena of life as a virgin spirit, a thought, a spark from
the divine Father, hurled into space with a force such
as God alone can send. This thought-form has its birth
in a world of virgin spirits where the divine flame com-
mences its long pilgrimage through matter, gathering
the material from each world, denser and denser, work-
ing its way through the mineral, the vegetable, the
16 ASTROLOGY AND THE DUCTLESS GLANDS
animal, and then into the human stage. Within this di-
vine spark are enfolded all the potentialities of the di-
vine Father. As a thought of a building which is gen-
erated by a man gradually takes form within his min~,
and as he puts his plans upon paper and straightway
procures material wherewith the building is to be
erected, so was God's thought, the spark which was to
become man, also made manifest., and we find it today
expressing in a body for which David praised God in
the 139th Psalm, saying, "I will praise thee; for I am
fearfully 'and wonderfully made." Paracelsus says,
''The physical body itself is the greatest of mysteries
because in it are contained in a condensed, solidified,
and corporeal state the very essences which go to make'
up the substance of the spiritual man, and this is the
secret of the Philosopher's Stone.''
There are mysteries within this-human temple which
man is unable to solve (which have baffled material
science), and for the solution of which many lives have
been sacrificed, both cf the human and the animal king-
dom. The vivisectors have jeopardized their very souls
in their ~-effort to solve these mysteries. Animals have
been put through the most excruciating suffering by
science in its endeavor to wrest these secrets from God.
But material science can go just so far when it finds
itself against a wall which its instruments and its
scientific minds cannot penetrate and it is help]e.<;s.
There is but one tool, which it cannot or will not recog-
nize, and which alone will penetrate or break through,
and that is the human spirit. The trained seer alone
PotARIAN EPocH 17
bile access to tbe higher regions wlfrch, unfcrtunately,
the materialist., beci;tuse he cannot be given matt>rial
proof, will not recognize. We must, however, give him
cteciit for having accomplished wonders in his struggle
to master and understand human ills. Materia medica
has accomplished wonderful things.
There are two forces in nature which man recognizes
and which he acknowledges as existing in every atom-
the positive force (male), and the negative force (fe-
male). We find them in the metals which man is
utiliZing to generate his 'electricity, the copper, zinc,
etc. ID the plant we also find the same elements. The
very tiniest atom in man's body is charged with these
two forces. They are playing through his body, with.
6ut the blending of which he could not hold the par-
tlcies together. Although man, with a male body, may
express the positive physical, yet his negative vital
body helps to hold the positive physical particles.to-
gether. Likewise, the woman expressing in the negative
female body is balanced by a positive vital body.
The various forms and deveiopments of man's body
during antenatal life are recapitulations of his de-
velopment during involution. !n the Polarian Epoch
his body was globular similar to the.ovum, and also of
a gelatinous substance. There was at the beginning
but one organ which protruded from the top of his
bag-like form. This organ was eyes, ears, in fact it
was the nucleus through which the rest of the body was
built, also.the medium through which man received
his life from the Father. This organ is today called
18 ASTROLOGY AND THE DUCTLESS GLANDS
the pineal gland-epiphysis. Man's energies at that
time were, like those of the foetus, directed inward to
build future ·organ1:1, and as the prenatal life of the
physical body of today is directed and helped by the
mother, so was man assisted during his involutionary
period by' the Divine Hierarchies. He was in direct
touch with the higher realms and not yet conscious of
his physical environment. In the meantime, eyes, ears,
and various organs were taking shape within this
ovoid body, while the pineal gland, 'which is at present
<ruch a mystery to medical science, was its only means
of communication with the outer world. This organ
was much larger than it is today and from its cone-
shaped top there protruded a long, transparent, flex-
ible tentacle which aided in locomotion and in feeling,
and this appendage may yet be seen on the small end
of the pineal gland. It has the appearance of a small
piece of skin, the function of which will be taken up
in another ehapter.

CHAPTER II
THE GARDEN OF EDEN
AN'S EVOLUTION and development up to
the present time is divided into five periods or
epochs by tile Rosicrucian teachings. We have
described his bodily development during the Polarian
Epoch, and we will uow make a study of it during the
next period, the Hyperborean Epoch. In the former
man was mineral-like, in the latter he developed a vital
body and was plant-like. In the third period, the
Lemurian Epoch, hti developed a desire body and be-
came animal-like. The earth ha.d already become en-
crusted and hardened in some places, and the atmos-
phere was dense and foglike. Man then lived in the
densest vegetation to protect himself from the intense
heat, while his body had grown to a giant-like size-
long arms and hands, massive jaws, but no forehead,
the top of the head IJeing very close to where the eye-
brows are today. The skeleton had partially formed
but was yet of a soft cartilaginous nature; man was
not yet able to walk upright. The blood, which had
heretofore been cold, now received iron and developed
red corpuscles, which in turn hardened the bodily
structure, making it possible for man to walk upright.
f19]
20 ASTROLOGY AND THE DUCTLESS GLANDS
We have· now reached the period of man's develop-
ment recorded in the second chapter of Genesis where
the Lord gave Adam an helpmate, at the sep:aration of
the sexes. Heretofore man was hermaphrodite; but
now we have arrived at the . time mentioned in the
story in the Bible of .A,dam and Eve when they were
turned out of the Garden of Eden for their sins. The
change in sex wa'.l not accomplished in a day as some
may read from the Book of Genesis, but was accom-
plished slowly and by degrees. As the earth became
more crystallized, man's evolution kept up with this
change, and it became necessary that the Ego draw
within the body in order to control it. To accomplish
this it was necessary that a brain and larynx be added,
and for this purpose man was required to sacrifice
one-half of his creative force. He then became an indi-
vidualized, thinking entity, a creator, and he was then
able to begin his work with the minerals.
Man was at that time unconscious of the change in
sex and was also unconscious of his outer surround-
ings, for his eyes had not yet been opened. Similar to
the deep-water fish or the mole, he had no need of these
organs, for the atmosphere was too dense and foggy.
However, after the earth was thrown off from the cen-
tral sun, the light which had theretofore been from
within came from ·without; nature always supplies
every need, hence man's eyes began slowly to develop.
As the brain was growing by stages, likewise other
organs which connected with the brain were built as
man's development demanded.
THE GARDEN OF EDEN 21
As the sexes separated and man outwardly expressed
one of the sexes only, the pineal gland, which i~ the
Polarian, Hyperborean, and the early pf!rt of the
Lemurian Epochs, protruded from the top of the head,
now drew within the skull.
There is another tiny organ within the brain of man,
the pituitary body, which has had much to do with his
development, bOth mentally and physically, and which
is as important as the epiphysis, the pineal gland.
The pituitary body or hypophysis is very necessary to
man's life and development; it appears in the foetus
in the fourth week.
We may trace the development of man's body
through all its stages from the very beginning up to
that of its present wonderful mechanism in the life of
th~ foetus; we first see it as a tiny speck of gelatinous
matter, attracted to another speck of the opposite
vibration. These are positive and negative~ We follow
the embryo through its development as it assumes the
bag-like shape which is its first attempt at form as
described in the preceding chapter, the globular, gelat-
inous form of the Polarian Epoch. This small em.
bryonic sac has within it all the potentialities of the
present perfected body with the two polarities, the
positive and negative, the male and female, the pineal
gland and the pituitary body. We follow this human
embryo through its growth and changes, which, as in
the case of p:i;ehistoric man, passes through the min·
eral-like stage, the plant stage, then the reptile stage
with its well marked tail which at the ninth week
22 ASTROLOGY AND THE DUCTLESS GLANDS
disappears. Following this is the animal stage with its
doglike face, with only aspot which later will become
the eyes, ears, et cetera. At one stage of its develop-
ment the pineal gland protrudes through the bag-like
sac, and then the 'little form passes through the stage
of the hermaphrodite as in the Hyperborean Epoch
when no distinction of sex is shown outwardly. And
so we may follow the evolution of man's body by the
changes in the prenatal growth of the child in its
mother's womb.
CHAPTER III
TWO DUCTLESS GLANDS
HE PINEAL gland and pituitary body are two
organs which have not had to undergo exten-
sive changes to bring them up to their present
stage. These organs were both present in the hag-
shaped body during the Polarian Epoch. Similar to the
Pituitary Body Pineal Gland
bud which contains both the stamen and pistil within
its ovoid shape, the pineal gland and the pituitary body
are the nuclei of the positive and negative forces by
means of which our physical growth has developed.
These tiny organs were larger in primitive man
than at present, and through them the cr~ative bier
archies termed in the Rosicrucian Philosophy the
(23]
24 ASTROLOGY AND THE DUCTLESS GLANDS
Lords of Form, have been able to assist the Ego to
build its body and bring it up to its present state of
perfection.
THE PITUITARY BODY
The pituitary body was so named by medical srienee
because it was formerly thought that the pituite or
mucus of the nose came from this body. 'l'his idea, how-
ever, has been discarded, and although medical science
affirms that the real functions of the pituitary bod~· are
speculative, still in the past few years it has gained
much knowledge which is no longer speculative. This
gland is situated in a saddle shaped depression of the
sphenoid bone, between the eyes and dfreetly back of
the root of the nose, and at the junction of the two
optic nerves. It is impossible to give its size, as it
changes with age, temperament, and the morals of the
p~rson. Gray describes it as a meeting piece in the
life of the primitive embryo of the hypobl&st, which is
the innermost layer; the epibkst, the outermost
layer, which later develops into the nervous system
and the skin; and the mesoblast, which is the middle
layer. Within these three layers are contailled all the
germinal organs of the body which are in formation.
Consequently the pituitary body is directly associated
with man's past, present, and future growth and de-
velopment, for from these three primitive layers within
the embr~o, the body with its senses, brain, nervous
system, and vital organs is developed, and the pitui-
Two DucTLESS GLANDS 25
tary body is the central ·station through which all
growth is directed. But the pineal gland is the reP.l
power behind it all, the formation of which we will
take up later.
The pituitary is a small oval body, consisting of two
lobes, the anterior or glandular portion, and the pos-
terior or nerve portion, each having its separate func-
tion, also varying in color. The anterior lobe is of a
yellowish gray substance intermingled with pink, while
the posterior lobe is darker. Medical science has in
the past few years made some noteworthy investiga-
tions; it claims that the pituitary body is smaller in
man than in woman and that its size increases rapidly
between birth and puberty; that the anterior lobe has
control over the bony structure of the skeleton, while
the posterior lobe has rule over the circulation and the
fluids of the body. The latter regulates the assimila-
tion of carbohydrates and other foods; renal secretions,
body temperature, et cetera.
One of our students who is a doctor stated in a
letter to the writer that he would not think of leaving
his office to attend an obstetricai case without having
pituitary extract in his case, which when used at the
proper time reduces labor pain from one to four hours.
This extract, however, in improper bands is a two-
edged sword.
The pituitary gland is connected directly with and
has rule over the outer sheath of the brain and spinal
column, the dura mater. This sheath embodies the
26 ASTROLOGY AND THE DUCTLESS GLANDS
gteat protective mother principle. It covers thr brain
and spinal cord, protecting them from outer impacts
and also feeding the blood vessels and nerves.
THE PINEAL <UJAND
The pineal gla:µd is a tiny cone-shaped body vnrying
in size according to the mental and spiritual status of
the person. It is named after the pine cone, which it
resembles ·in appearance. It is larger in a child than
in an adult and larger in females than in males. Its
functions are almost unknown to science. Some claim
that it has direct rule over the generative organs and
the .brain. Extracts of it when injected into the cir-
culation produce a slight dilation of the blood vessels.
It is large at birth and is fully developed at puberty.
Its structural evolution begins at the age of seven
years. Dana and Berkeley in their investigations
found thifi organ small and lacking in substance in
children who were backward mentally. Science has
also been able to connect this gland with the functions
of the interstitial gland and of the brain, but these
conclusions are only spe'culative.
The pineal gland is held in place by the pia mater,
a thin membrane or sheath surrounding the brain and
spinal column, from which the entire central uervous
system is fed, and from which many little nerve roots
branch off between the spinal vertebrae. The dura
mater is ·the outermost sheath while the pia mater is
the iunermost. The pineal gland has the appearance
Two .DUCTLESS GLANDS 27
of a small male organ and rests upon what is termed
by science the quadrigeminae, four rounded eminences
placed ir two pairs. The two lower ones are called the
bu ttoeks, the two upper the testes, and the tiny pineal
gland rests in the center of them. The pituitary body
is connected with the dura mater, the mother principle,
on the anterior side of the third ventricle. The pineal
gland, the male or positive organ, is connected with
the pia mater and is located at the posterior end of the
third ventricle; rrinsrqnently this tiny cavity or ven-
tricle is of great importance to man as we shall see
later.
CHAPTER IV
THE SPINAL GAS
I]
CCORDTNG to the Rosicrucian teachings the
blood is a gas and not a liquid as affirmed by
science. When the spinal column is observed
by one with the spiritual sight developed, the spinal
gas appears like a thin stream of light, the color of
which differs according to the temperament and morals
of the man. In the sensual man this spinal fire is a dull
brick red, intermingled with a slight coloring of blue.
As his aspirations rise and his love for others is awak-
ened, this color becomes clearer, and the blue light with
a slight coloring of pink is drawn upward. When one
observes the spinal gas of the spiritually awakened
man, who has purified his mind and body by high
ideals and by a life of service, especially if observed
while he is in meditation or prayer, there is seen a
most wonderful sight. The spinal fire is of a most
ethereal blue which is difficult to describe; the nearest
color to it would be that of a blue gas flame. with the
softest tint of pink and yellow playing through it.

with red, but as the spinal gas rises upward; it become:;;
purer and more trar..sparent. This spinal fire during
meditation and prayer becomes more active, coursing
more swiftly thi:ough the spine, and as it touches the
spinal nerves, it emits a tiny spark at the beginning
of each until it reaches the medulla oblongata, which
seems to act as a transformer or separating station,
where the color makes a change, the darker or murky
colors again descending. while the lighter and purified
gas is drawn upward.
There is a sieve-like encl,osure at the lower end of
the fourth ventricle, which is connected with the
medulla oblongata. In the latter this gas seemingly
goes through a purifying process; thence it passes
through the fourth ventricle into the third, where it
passes through a golden furnace-like glow. It is then
absorbed by the pineal gland.
The color of this flame, however, is different in an
adult who is earthly, filled with passions and desires,
whose body is fed on the flesh of slaughtered animals,
and which is steeped in tobacco, liquor, et cetera. This
man's spinal gas is of a murky rose color and has a
tendency to cling to the lower part of the spinal column.
It is with considerable effort that such aman may draw
some of this gas to the brain for use in mental work;
and its color is not the clear blue of that of the man
with high aspirations.
The pineal gland of the sensual man who dissipates
his vital fluids is very small, while in the child and the
adult who lives a.chaste life this organ is large.
30 ASTROLOGY AND THE DUCTLESS GLANDS
Water when bronght to a certain heat is turned into
steam and may evaporate into the air, leaving a tiny
residue of crystallized sediment in the kettle. Con-
versely, the blood wl1ile in the body is a gas, but when
it comes in contact with the air, it condenses and be-
comes a liqnid. Now how is it possible under similar
conditions for scieme to investigate with its material
instruments :md clearly understand .the functions of
two such vital organs as the pineal gland and the
pituitary body, whose inaccessibility. makes it almost
impossible to remove them without changing their
shape1
When the man with the developed faculty of spir-
itual sight, however, investigates their physiological
functions, he does not need to remove the organs but
turns his X-ray sight upon them and observes their
action.
SPIRITUAL OBSERVATION
The writer has been privileged while under the
direction of the Teacher to watch these two higher
ductless glands in action. The time and opportunity
were ideally prepared, and a living person was the sub-
ject. Both organs were much enlarged which gave
marvelous clearness to our observations.
Let us observe this subject, a woman in spiritual
meditation, one who has been living a pure and chaste
life with high aspirations, and whose food for years
has consisted of frnit, vegetables, and cereals. The
pitnit:irY body, through which these aspirations are
THE SPINAL GAS 31
first registered, is much enlarged. The posterior lobe
is turned backward with its funnel shaped neck en-
larged with a mouth opening at the end. From this
open mouth exudes gas of a soft rose color, slightly
intermingled with yellow and blue of the pale shades.
The spmal column is filled with a pale blue ether,
intrrmingled with scft pink and yellow. After this
gas leaves the medulla oblongata and enters the pineal
gland, it is of a wonderful blue color such as one sees
clinging to the mountains after sundown. The pineal
gland is enlarged with .the point of the cone leaning
forward toward the pituitary body. The tiny append-
age of skin &t the end of the former, which was men-
tioned in a previous chapter, is elongated and emits
a small flame similar to the blue flame of a gas jet.
These two organs vibrate at a most rapid rate and lean
toward each other over the third ventric.le. This
ventricle is an oblong cavity lying between the optic
thalami. When the life of the aspirant has been pure,
the ventricle appears to the occultist like a tiny furnace
with a golden glow. From this the vitality of the body
is drawn.
The pineal gland as already stated, has the appear-
ance of a tiny male organ, while the pituitary body
with its open mouth is similar to the female organ. So
we may see that sciance, which is trying to prove that
·these organs are directly conneeted with the functions
of the brain and the generative organs, is right. They
-!rave direct influence upon man from the two ends of
the spinal cord, for does not the sex pervert in time
32 ASTROLOGY AND THE DUCTLESS GLANDS
become a degenerah'? Conservation of the vital fl11irls
and a chaste life strengthen the brain, and thc~c· two
ductless glands become enlarged, but in the srns11alist
they atrophy. Science is correct in its as'·rr:i·in tlrn t
these organs are larger in children and wome11 thau in
men, even men who live a pure life.
ASTROLOGICALLY DISCERNED
In an endeavor to further prove the above a~sertions
astrologically, the writer has compared the hor;1.,;(·opes
of patients who have been in touch wi ~·h tlw He:lling
Department at Headquarters. She found ten hor-
oscopes of young men and women who were afiiictecl
with epilepsy. Four of these patients were fo11nd with
the Moon-in conjunction with Neptune in the si~n of
'rauri.1s. This sign bas rule over the throat and ali:;o
indirectly over the generative organs. Here again we
find, as Max Heindel has said, that Neptune is the
higher octave of Mercury and not of Ven ns, as some
astrologers claim, for this planet, which hl:s rule OYer
the pineal gland, also has· rule over the brain and the
spiritual faculties. Two patients out of these ten ill: ve
Neptune square to the Moon, while one has Nept11ne i?l
conjunction with Mars and another Neptune in opposi-
tion to Saturn. In all of these cases we found that
they had formed the secret habit of sex abuse durin~
childhood, which had wasted the vital fluids necessary
in building the brain, and there was a mental deficiency
bordering upon idiocy. If the doctors eould have
opened the brains of these patients to examine the
33
glands, they would have found them diseased accord-
ing to the planeta1·y afflictions, which might have taken
the form of atrophy, tumor, or in the case of the pineal
gland, inflammation.
Astrologers in the past have made the claim that
Uranus was the higher octave of Mercury, and had
rule over the higher mental qualities, and that Nep-
tune was the higher octave of Venus. At the same time
they have admitted that an afflicted Uranus in the
angles caused separations in marriage, and that a
square or conjunction of Uranus and Venus in- a
woman's horoscope would attract undue attention from
the opposite sex, thereby endangering her morality.
Uranus has always been associated with licentiousness
and laxity in morals, &ncl illicit love affairs, while Nep-
tune has been connected with secret orders, deceptions,
and frauds. The writer has wondered why these two
higher spiritual planets were reversed by the astrol-
ogers when they represent opposite characteristics.
Spiritual investigation shows the higher octaYes to
be as follows : Neptune, ruler of the pineal gland, is the
higher octave of :Mercury; Uranus, ruler of the pitui-
tary body, is the higher octave of Venus.
The drunkard when under the influence of liquor
has an over-stimulation of the pituitary body. which
causes reeling, hilarious conditions. This gland regu-
lates the emotional nature and the circulation of thE
blood. Being ruled by Uranus, the higher octave of
Venus, the ruler of music, the pituitary body is in-
34 ASTROLOGY AND THE DUCTLESS GLANDS
fluenced by music and harmony which set it into vihra-
tion. The morphine or cocaine inebriate receives his
stimulus through the pineal gland.
REJUVENATION
We have read much in the papers about rejuvenation
through the grafting of animal glands into man to
re;;tore his youth. Should this be carried to any great
extent, the next generation would be liable to have
many degenerate children and the institutions would
be filled with mental perverts. The animals from
which these glands are taken, the goat and monkey,
multiply very rapidly, and naturally there would be a
degenerating effect upon the man who is foolish enough
to permit this grafting to be done upon his body.
Furthermore, this rejuvenation is for a short time
only. If the man continues. to live the life of the
senses, he will soon dissipate this new energy, which
will have to be replenished from time to time.
There is but one fountain of youth, one elixir of life,
and that is our food and our thoughts. If we live a
pure and simple life of unselfishness, eating lightly of
vegetables and fruit, keeping close watch over our de-
sires, then we need not sacrifice the life of the animal
to replenish our wasted energy. Ponce de Leon sought
the fountain of perpetual youth in far-off lands, while
he had two tiny cups within his own brain which, if he
had only paid the price of making an exchange of the
worldly life of the senses for a spiritual life of purity,
would have given him the elixir of life.
