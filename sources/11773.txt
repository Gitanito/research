  		              		Experience Description   

    The Cardiologist was trying to move a stent that didn't need to be moved whereby he punctured my heart. I don’t remember much else on earth until I start to wake up in the ICU.  The doctors told my family that they would know in twenty-four hours if I live or die.
  
  I do, however, remember what happened when I was out of my body. I saw people dressed in white. I was in a peaceful place and surrounded by green grass with beautiful flowers. To go further, I would need to go through a gate. While I waited, the person at the gate  came back and said it was  my time go back. But I know if a family member who had passed away and brought me past the gate that I wasn’t coming back.
