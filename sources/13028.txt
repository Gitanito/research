I had returned home after spending some time shopping with my mother. I put an item I had purchased at a garage sale in my storage area and went into the house. I suddenly had a severe crushing feeling in my chest. I grabbed the phone and sat down thinking I had done something unloading my purchase. I began to sweat profusely and at that time, I knew something was definitely wrong. I called 911 and explained the situation to the dispatcher. I began to get extremely tired and had to fight to keep talking to the dispatcher. I kept saying 'please hurry'. It seemed as though it took forever for the aid car to arrive. In reality, it was about 5 minutes. The medics loaded me on a gurney and into the aid car. I was still fighting to stay awake. I remember one of them asking if they could cut off my shirt. I thought 'Why do they want to do that?' At that point, I was looking down on myself watching the medic cut open my shirt. I wondered 'How am I seeing this?' Then I realized something was really wrong. The next thing I remember was being rolled into the emergency room.
